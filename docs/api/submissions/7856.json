[Edit: we are both men. Not that it matters, but I\u2019m getting called \u201cshe\u201d a lot.] He makes decent money because he\u2019s like a supervisor guy, but he\u2019s very busy. He leaves the house by 5am every morning.  \n\nI work a little doing some freelance document translation from home, but it\u2019s probably about 10-15 hours a week. I mainly make sure the house in order and that my partner has everything he needs (cleans clothes, packed lunch, dinner made, house stocked, etc). It\u2019s just the two of us; we don\u2019t have kids or pets. He does house work too, mainly outdoor things like lawn care or fixing anything that breaks.  \n\nAnyway, I usually go grocery shopping on Fridays. So this morning I went to make his lunch, and we didn\u2019t have that much. We were out of lunch meat, so I improvised. I sent him a lettuce sandwich. It was a thick layer of iceberg lettuce, with tomato, onion, cucumber, Swiss cheese, and mayo on a large Kaiser roll bun. And then I sent  a Tupperware of these seasoned, crunchy chickpeas that I make in the oven, two Lindor chocolate balls, and a can of flavored fizzy water. I thought it seemed like a decent lunch, anyway my mom used to make lettuce sandwiches when we didn\u2019t have money.  \n\nWell, he texted me kind of mad. He said, \u201cWhat the hell is this? It\u2019s just lettuce.\u201d I said we didn\u2019t have any meat, and I was just trying to put something together in the morning before grocery shopping. He said, \u201cThis is not a lunch. I\u2019m going to be hungry all day now. It\u2019s fine if we didn\u2019t have anything, but just tell me and I\u2019ll order in a lunch. Now it\u2019s too late to order anything because you made me think I had an actual lunch but it\u2019s just lettuce.\u201d  \n\nIn general, he\u2019s not one of those \u201ccarnivore\u201d men who must eat meat at every meal, but we do usually usually eat meat. His job can be stressful, so I just apologized and said I\u2019d do that next time. He didn\u2019t respond but now three hours later, he just texted, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re sorry but you don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like to have to do hours of physical work on an empty stomach.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t respond, but now I\u2019m feeling a little annoyed with him. Like, does he really have an *empty* stomach? It was a lunch after all. He is pretty big, like 6 foot, 220 lbs, basically no fat on him. So maybe he does need more. I don\u2019t know. In general, I know he works very hard and I get to have a relatively stress-free life. So, I feel bad making his day harder than it has to be. But I feel like he\u2019s kind of exaggerating. Anyway, it\u2019s not going to be a big issue. And I already went to the store and am making homemade bacon double cheeseburgers and fresh cut fries for dinner, lol. But I was just wondering if it\u2019s really so bad to send a lettuce sandwich for lunch.\n\nEdit: So, the man is fed and happy, lol. I didn\u2019t bring it up or act angry or anything. I just let it go, and he did apologize on his own after dinner. He basically said, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be a jerk about lunch, but yeah next time just let me know if we are out of meat and I\u2019ll order some food.\u201d And I just said, \u201cYeah, sorry about that. My brain probably wasn\u2019t fully functioning that early.\u201d And that was it. Now we are chilling on the couch together, so all good. \n\nOh, and the people wondering *why* I didn\u2019t have food in the house, this man housed an entire tray of enchiladas for dinner yesterday that I was expecting to have leftovers to send for lunch today. I was gonna send that with a salad (not on bread) and some crackers, and the chocolates. That\u2019s why I was at a bit of a loss this morning. \n\nAnyway, thanks for the responses. Lots of NTAs, but YTAs from people who\u2019ve actually been in my partner\u2019s situation. So, I\u2019ll just be more mindful of that going forward.

Although you should've warned him that it was an improv lunch, just in case, it sounds like you didn't have any reason to think that he'd rather order in.\n\nThis is a learning experience, but nobody here is really an asshole (the text is most likely a result of being hangry). Talk about it after dinner", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't be taking this out on you. You prepared him a lovely, hearty vegetarian meal. \n\nA couple slices of ham aren't gonna change the impact of that meal overly much. \n\nHe's being a baby and owes YOU an apology.\n\n\"You need to apologize or I won't be making your lunches going forward.\"", "NTA. Your partner is free to make his own lunches.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t just put lettuce on it, it had more toppings.

It sounds like outside of this instance it is working for them as a couple and that\u2019s all that matters.", "You described a cheese sandwich, which is a thing that people regularly eat. If the lunch recipient is unhappy with what's prepared for him, he's an adult who is free to pack his own lunch. NTA", "NTA. That was a cheese salad sandwich and he's being a baby.", "NAH\n\nI agree that the lunch was tiny for someone who works construction. That job is extremely physically demanding and most people I know who do this kind of work eat big lunches because it makes you very hungry.\n\nSo yes, you did not give him enough food but you didn't do it intentionally.\nHis reaction was a bit over the top, but I get it. In the moment when you're very hungry and are looking forward to a nice lunch it's a shock to discover you have a lot less than you expected.\n\nJust ask him how much he needs for lunch and take this to heart.", "INFO: \n\nWhat do you normally pack for his lunch, assuming a fully stocked kitchen?", "You're NTA. He is overreacting. And most construction sites have mobile food trucks skulking around, so he probably had options. His response to your apology was rude.", "You\u2019re definitely not the AH and his texts just sound like the ravings of a hangry person!", "NTA. If I made my partner lunch, I\u2019d obviously want to know if he didn\u2019t like it so I\u2019d know not to make it again. That said, I\u2019d expect him to notify me politely. The way your partner reacted was extremely immature, disrespectful, and inconsiderate of the effort you put in to prepare it.", "Eh probably should have told him so he could decide what to do. He's probably hangry, physical labor requires more calories and burns more.Your dinner sounds like a good choice,maybe have a snack ready for when he gets home or yummy dessert.", "NTA - you did your best with the situation and supplies available.\n\nI imagine your partner was just a bit hangry. My own partner has a very physical job and has on occasion had a grump about the food I've prepped for him, but he always ends up apologising and usually it's just been down to having a stressful work day and then an unexpected change to his routine.", "ESH.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, sounds like a tasty lunch.  I\u2019d devour that sandwich you made.  Where you goofed up was not giving him the heads up about the nature of the sandwich.  Not only is it disappointing opening up a sandwich after a hard morning\u2019s work and finding NO meat, but you didn\u2019t give him the ability to grab something on the way there or head to the cafeteria instead.  He just bit into his sandwich at lunch and boom, where\u2019s the meat?  \n\nBut other than this lapse in judgment, I\u2019d say a job well done.  And he\u2019s not going to starve lmao, that\u2019s plenty of food with a fair bit of protein too.  Being mildly ticked about the whole thing is fair, but he overreacted.  \n\nSource:  I\u2019m a guy with an active industrial job.", "NTA. He\u2019s being dramatic and ungrateful. I\u2019d stop making him meals, at least until he apologizes.", "NTA. Should\u2019ve checked it before leaving, or it could have been resolved by saying, \u201cyou know, honey, I appreciate you making my lunch. If it\u2019s possible to have some meat in that sandwich, I\u2019d greatly appreciate it\u201d after work or something. It DOES sound like a pretty light meal if he works a really physical job (I\u2019d go for something that sticks to the ribs a little more,) but it\u2019s also a fantastic lunch in terms of nutrition and definitely not an empty stomach situation!", "I eat cheese sandwiches all the time. Sometimes not even with the lettuce and tomato and like just cheese in bread lol. Yours sounds amazing. NTA. I do think you could have warned him you ran low on supplies and made a lettuce and cheese sandwich instead, but it sounds like you made a decent sized one as well as a nice side too so I do think he exaggerated. He was probably just disappointed he didn't get what he expected to get. He's set the expectations now tho so next time you run out of supplies before you make it to the market let him know if he wants to order something instead and enjoy the yummy sounding sandwich yourself. Or maybe move your shopping day up if you notice the lunch meat getting light/order a little extra?\n\nHonestly you made a salad and put it on bread and a lot of people survive on less for lunch. The fact he keeps highlighting it was JUST LETTUCE and ignoring the rest of the ingredients and work you put into making it is kind of weird to me.", "With a job that is burning a lot of calories, yes, a lettuce lunch does not really cut it. In those jobs some easy calories should be included in lunch; it is not about volume. I don't want to call you an ah for it, but really don't surprise him like that again. When improvising a lunch, say so!", "NTA - this was a cheese sandwich with salad. I honestly don't understand what he is complaining about.", "NTA, since it's not the regular lunch he has you could have communicated with him. \n\nBut the way he acted, and treated you was rude. You did make him lunch, and after all it wasn't just bread and lettuce (from the title that's what I thought it was). But that is a decent lunch. \n\nHe was rude and ungrateful to you, and he might have been stressed and hangry, but that doesn't give him the right to treat you badly. He could have expressed and communicated better for you not to do that in the future.", "NTA because you didn't have to make him a lunch at all BUT construction workers work really hard. It's a physically demanding job which does make a person hungry. That kind of work burns up a ton of calories. \n\nA little communication letting him know you improvised would have given him a heads up that he needed to stop and pick up something else to get him through the day. \n\nTake this as a learning experience, apologize to him when he gets home and move on.", "NTA.  I'd have responded to that last message with \"guess I don't really know how to make a sandwich either, so it's probably better if you make your own from now on.\"", "NTA but next time, tell him ahead of time that it\u2019s a departure from the norm, explain it\u2019s a cheese sandwich \u2013 because it was, and blend the chickpeas to make a thick hummus to spread on the bread. And voila, it\u2019s a full sandwich.", "I do not get all these N T A. this dude is a grown ass man that doesn't have kids and essentially stays at home to play house for his husband. Dude you have it easy, if you want to play house you job is to make sure that there is food in the house. You said money isn't an issue so it's not like you couldn't afford groceries. I'd be pissed to if I went to work doing construction so my partner could sit at home and chill the majority of the time and I got a fucking lettuce sandwich for lunch too. Def YTA.", "NTA he can make his own lunch if he does not like it.", "NTA. Adding a couple of slices of meat to the salad sandwixh would not have made much difference protein wise.\n\nHe can start making his own lunches.", "NTA sounds like a great lunch tbh. I like eating meat as well but if someone is going to be making me a lunch everyday with bread, cheese, chocolates and fizzy water I'm not going to complain one bit!", "nta - that sandwich sounded healthy and good for him.  he was just ticked there was no meat.  and he could have waited til he got home to complain instead of whining about it via text.", "NTA There was cheese and other things on there too. Not every meal has to include meat. He got irrationally angry.", "ESH - Mild for you  because you should have told him he only had a lettuce sandwich.  He is the bigger A H for coming at you a second time.  He's HANGRY.", "NTA  You are doing him a favor by packing him a lunch. He could pack his own or buy his lunch.\n\nYou sent what you had today. I understand if he did not feel it was filling enough for him with an active job but that is not a reason to actually be angry. You tried to make what you thought was a nice lunch. It was fine to say \u201chey, tell me in future so I can just buy something\u201d or \u201cI really need 2,000 calorie lunches on work days.\u201d", "YTA for having no common sense. Construction is a physically demanding job. Peanut butter & jelly would have been better.", "NTA. What you sent him was a decent lunch.

A lettuce sandwich (a salad with more steps) is never going to be enough. Just give him a heads up next time.\n\nThat said - bunch of folks on here that have clearly never done labor intensive work.", "He is absolutely right. Your part of the deal is to provide him his lunch. You didn\u2019t, and you are getting offended. And you are getting more offended because he told you that you just needed to warn him. Yta", "Lettuce sandwiches are awesome! Loved them as a kid. Nta", "Is he your partner or your child? Although it's nice of you to make him lunch..maybe from here on out he can adult and make his own. NTA", "NTA - a tomato sandwich is a thing and that\u2019s what you made.", "NTA bc you added a lot to the meatless sandwich but you really do need to not have to rely on him financially so that he can\u2019t pull rank on you each time he\u2019s upset about what you did or didn\u2019t do as far as domestic work.\nEdited to add: Domestic labor is of great value but it\u2019s severely undervalued in a patriarchal system. Trust and believe your boyfriend is operating from this mindset.", "YTA", "Did he not eat breakfast ?", "NTA. That's a very normal vegetarian sandwich (certainly now something i would refer to as just a \"lettuce sandwich\") and is a perfectly healthy balance of fiber and protein. You made him a nice and healthy lunch and he reacted horribly. If I were you I'd make him make his own lunches from here on out. If he's gonna throw a fit like a toddler then he can make his own food.", "NTA. He sounds so rude. My partner also does contstruction/carpentry work. I work from home as a software engineer, but like you I'm also not really pulling full time hours. However my partner still does half the cooking, half of most chores (since laundry takes forever, I do a lot more of it from home than he does after work), and contributes to half our income. He would be so sweet and grateful if I took the time to make him lunch. Heck most of the time he makes me coffee in bed and is still the one to go to the store for groceries after work. \n\nI'm not saying this to compete with you. I'm saying this because we ostensibly have similar lives and similar partners.Yet mine would never ever ever speak to me like this. If he was truly upset about a lettuce sandwich, he might talk to me about it later and explain why a heads up would set him up for more success at work when we don't have many groceries for a bag lunch. Your partner should not treat you this way. You deserve someone who happily does half of all your shared life tasks, who is excited to do kind things for you, and who feels grateful when you do things for them, even if you have limited resources to use when doing tasks for them. My partner isn't special or going above and beyond. My partner is treating me with love and kindness. This is just baseline expected behavior from a partner. You should have this too. If your partner can't treat you like mine treats me, then he is not meeting basic partner expectations and doesn't deserve your time and love.", "YTA, you sent him a meal for a ballerina on a diet, not a massive shithouse who works construction. Vegetarian sandwich, some chickpeas and a fizzy water with two chocolates probably didn't top 400 calories. Guy probably needs 3000 a day easy at his size and activity level. You had no snacks, no beef jerky, bag of chips, nothing else to send? Plz be for real.", "That sounds like a tasty cheese sandwich with lots of veg!  And you included a serving of protein in the form of the roasted beans.  \n\nNo, it's not so bad.  \n\nMaybe he was just in a pissy mood anyway and finding an unexpected type of sandwich just finished damaging his calm.\n\nI'm torn between N T A and N A H, but I think I'm leaning toward NAH", "I mean.. NTA. maybe you could have given him a heads up or something. but it's a bit weird that you pack him a lunch every day like you're his mom, imo. I feel like if this is the agreement he doesn't get to complain.", "NTA\n\nthat sandwich sounds delicious!!!", "NTA. You made a lunch alternative that would have been acceptable to most people. Your partner expressed his dislike for the alternative and requested that you inform him beforehand. \n\nI almost thought N A H, but the \"you don't know what it's like to work on an empty stomach\" is passive aggressive though.", "That wasn\u2019t a lettuce sandwich, it was a vegetarian sandwich. Your partner is losing his mind over not having m at for one lunch? He\u2019s being unreasonable. NTA", "YTA - you should have warned him it wasn\u2019t as big or filling of a lunch as usual so he could figure out an alternative. If he\u2019s in constructions, he probably needs a high protein lunch to get him through", "YTA mainly. He needs protein, but he acted like a dick to you. \n\nGuys working construction eat like crazy unless he's farting around the office.\n\nI know when I was sending mine off he'd make himself three sambos every day and still come home ravenous.  Lettuce doesn't fill you long term, it's mainly water.\n\nNext time give him a heads up.", "YTA.  When I used to do labor I was burning thousands of calories a day.  I could eat anything, I mean anything, and still lose weight.  He needs calories for his lunch.  Not lettuce.", "Ehhh, NAH\n\nHe does need protein for his diet, so it shouldn't be a normal thing\n\nBut clearly you tried with what you had", "YTA.

This was a decent lunch.  There's seriously something wrong being so upset aboiut a sandwich.  What does he do when he has serious problems.  You said he was a supervisor and made good money.  I'm sure anyone in a supervisor position could go off the site or order something to be delivered.  I'm not sure why you felt the need to apologize for his little temper tantrum.

You didn't necessarily do anything wrong, and he was kind of an AH in response. But it was likely the hangry talking. When you're really hungry and looking forward to your meal, then discover it's lacking something you would typically enjoy, it can cause some pretty severe irritation. But it was a simple mistake.

If I did physical labor I'd probably be consuming an absurd amount of calories.\n\nOP didn't deserve to be treated that way when they clearly put in effort to make a decent lunch, but I do also feel for their partner who was probably pretty darn hungry that day.\n\nBTW OP, I think you're a super stand up guy for going to the store and planning a huge dinner. If I had been your partner and reacted that way, by the time I got home and saw the effort you were going to I'd feel really bad and would be reminded how awesome you are.", "NAH\u2026but didn\u2019t you notice when you made Thursdays    lunch that you were low on food? Instead of Friday being the official shopping day, you should\u2019ve went on Thursday. I know your heart was in the right place, but the lunch sucked.", "NAH - big guy doing manual labor needs food. It\u2019s not some manly man thing. It\u2019s literally cause your body is craving calories. A light lunch will basically mean OP\u2019s partner is hungry an hour later and then spends the last few hours feeling crappy from an empty stomach.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t deserve his hangry reaction. Do you think there\u2019s more behind it than him wanting meat between the buns? Why did you feel the need to explain that your financial contribution is less than his? Do you think he\u2019s not happy with more than just the sandwich?", "NTA. Is's a big sanfwiche that just didn't have meat on it. He won't starve to death. Maybe he just has a bad day?", "NAH - you did your best but that didn\u2019t cut it for him. He asked you in the future to just let him know so he can order something. Right now he\u2019s hangry. This is a normal relationship thing, talk it out and move on.", "Ok, I\u2019ll get downvoted but YTA, gently. Because you sent him with less calories and less protein than what is to be expected. So he probably was hungry most of the day. But you obviously didn\u2019t do it out of spite or anything like that. \n\nIt was just a miscommunication. I hope he appreciates that you do pack good meals for him.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but in his line of work he DOES need more than a lettuce sandwich. It\u2019s a physically demanding job. You could have just told him instead of assuming he would be okay with that.", "NAH, but having done physical work a lot, he is not wrong about needing calorie density. If the bulk of what was normally meat was replaced by cheese, then he's throwing a fit. If you put the normal amount of cheese on and replaced the meat with extra veggie toppings, you just cut the calorie count in the sandwich to about half what he's used to. He was a but rude but he is not wrong about you needing to warn him about things like that.", "Y t a for putting that much lettuce on a veggie and cheese sandwich. Bleh.\n\nI do agree that would not be a sufficient meal for someone doing such a physical job, however he overreacted and while he likely was hungry an hour later, he was acting like a baby.", "ESH\n\nI think it's more the lack of communication here.  Had you just said you were out of stuff, he could have been presented with options. Take what you have. He could order something. Have picked something up. Decided to drop him something off later.  Was he acting like a baby? Also, yes.", "NAH.\n\nI've got to assume most of the N TAs haven't ever worked in a manual labor job, because that is absolutely not enough to go on for the day. Construction especially, you need a lot of calories and protein to keep you going, especially with a  build like his. Without an adequate meal, you end up running on fumes, which makes you bone tired and pissed. That anger is the body/brain's reaction to the threat of collapse (literally - I've seen guys pass out trying to work with no lunch). And the lack of energy impacts mental functions *significantly*, which is dangerous on-site. \n\nSo yeah, his reaction was harsh, but it's natural to be angry and terse in that situation, and he's not an AH for it. On the flip side, you clearly didn't know how this would impact him, so you're not an AH here either. Just make sure you tell him next time there's not enough food to pack what he usually eats, so he can plan ahead and stay safe.", "NAH - I feel that communication kinda just fell apart in this whole scenario and it should be a learning opportunity for your relationship. \n\nA quick, \"Hey, we ran out of lunch meat and I had to improvise\" is nice gesture. And he could have communicated his frustration in a more healthy manner. \n\nJust talk through how each other would like to handle similar situations in the future like rational adults and move on.", "NAH, physical job need lots of calories to fuel them. Normally,  it wouldn't be a big deal, except for the physical labor part. I've seen big strong people become unable to function without enough to eat.....especially when it's unexpected. \nTALK to your partner and do better in the future.", "NAH: You have no idea the absolute hell I got from my peers when I made a cheese sandwich around them the first time. It's gotta be one of those things, some people have straight up never seen it before. \n\nAs someone who works construction, I get it from his side too. You don't get to leave work for lunch usually, and when you do you're tucking into something hands covered in god knows what in a fucked up filthy pickup truck. One time I had made a sandwich and not noticed the bread was moldy in the wee hours of the morning, man I was pissed. \n\nSo it's just a communication error here, there's no need to escalate it beyond a talk IMO.", "LOL\n\nFor God\u2019s sake keep some cans of tuna in the pantry for emergencies.\n\nNAH", "I suspect maybe OP's husband was having a rough day, he still shouldn't have snapped at OP over it though, sounds like a great cheese and bonus stuff sandwich!

Everyone is different. A one minute hey we're out of meat, then it wouldn't have gotten to this.", "I have to agree. He made him a cheese sandwich with all the toppings and a nice side. \n\nOP: NTA and your partner is absolutely free to prepare his own lunch moving forward. You are a partner not a private chef.", "This is the one right here. OP you did something out of the kindness of your heart to take care of your partner. He was given multiple forms of protein in cheese and chickpeas, perhaps not what he was expecting, but you did the best with what was on hand. You don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth. He very kindly could have said, \u201chey thanks for the lunch today, but could we maybe avoid lettuce sandwiches going forward, it was kind of hard to get through the day today, I prefer to have a more substantial meal\u201d when he got home if it was *that* big of a deal.

Spoiled boy lol", "She's also free to pay her own bills lol.", "I used to work construction, as an assistant (meaning I was doing whatever nobody else wanted to do, like carrying bricks and plywall up the stairs).\n\nOur day was 8 hours + 30 min lunch, and for lunch I always had two rye bread sanwiches. Sometimes with cheese, sometimes with ham, sometimes both. It never really made difference what I put inside, it's the bread that kept the hunger at bay, the rest was seasoning. Sure some people ate WAY more than me, but for me it was enough to last me till I got home to a hearty meal. We can function quite well for quite long even in great physical stress with quite little, but I suppose it takes some getting used to. So long as you consume the needed calories within the 24 hours, your body will adapt.", "What? The amount isn't the problem the other guy is complaining about. He is complaining that the sandwich doesn't have meat and so he decided to just not eat the rest of the lunch which included a Tupperware of chickpeas.\n\nThe guy worked hungry because he threw a tantrum of not having meat in a sandwich.\n\nOP is TAH for not telling him its different but the guy is a bigger AH for throwing a hissy fit and deciding to not eat it because it didn't fit his likes.", "Yeah people saying NTA in here dont realize you need lots of calories to keep going in a construction job, especially if it's outdoors, especially if the guy is 220lb. He probably did have cramps all afternoon.\n\nIt's nice you make lunch but you should both take this as a learning opportunity!", "So, most days, when I make dinner I will use the ingredients to make something different for his lunch the next day. Like, if I do spaghetti and meat sauce for dinner, I\u2019ll make meatballs and send him a meatball sub. If I\u2019m making chicken breasts, then I\u2019ll cut an extra one into strips and bread and pan fry it, and make an Asian crispy chicken wrap. I don\u2019t usually tell him what\u2019s for lunch because he usually texts me like, \u201cThis is sooo good!!\u201d or whatever. So I just let him see his lunch at lunchtime. I don\u2019t think today\u2019s lunch was all that much smaller than usual, but usually there\u2019s more fat and protein. This one was more vegetable.", "Lol, thanks. I\u2019m trying not to take it too seriously, so that cheered me up a bit", "Thanks, that makes sense. I guess I should have at least told him in the morning.", "But there is some calories in that: bread, cheese, chickpeas, \u2026 I don\u2019t really get in what way it is different than a cheese sandwich honestly.\nBut yeah, if it is really different that\u2019s usual, a simple \u00ab\u00a0hey, we didn\u2019t have a lot of things left, so I made this\u00a0\u00bb would clear any disagreements on what constitutes a decent lunch.", "I used to do garden construction and I was burning so many calories I had to pack two lunches.

But always you must have olive oil.  \nAnyway, just bake them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper at 425 degrees until crispy. It can be like 20 mins or longer if your seasoning was wet like lemon juice or hot sauce. Basically it all has to evaporate and then it gets crispy.

They will only stay crunchy for like 2 days which is when they are best, but you can still eat them after they soft again.

Protein in meat also raises blood sugar a little, so cheese is a weapon in the war on diabetes, (assuming you count calories carefully too). Your partner needs to look into this \"empty stomach\" thing. The required calories in saturated fat don't take up much physical room at about 10 Kcals per gram, and of course the salad provided micro nutrients like salad does so well. You did good.

I agree the lunch sounds lighter/different to what he expected, but it sounds probably 750-1100 calories.\n\nLarge kaiser rolls are like 200 before you put anything on them then 100 per slice of cheese and 100 per tbsp mayo. 250ish calories for a cup of chickpeas roasted in oil.

Just rinse and drain a can of chickpeas. Put them in a bowl and toss with olive oil and seasoning. You can use anything you want. Salt, lemon juice, garlic, and paprika are really good. Also, Cajun spice is really good, so is hot Old Bay seasoning. Also, lime, salt and chile powder is good or you can use salt and a hot sauce like Valentina. But always you must have olive oil.\nAnyway, just bake them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper at 425 degrees until crispy. It can be like 20 mins or longer if your seasoning was wet like lemon juice or hot sauce. Basically it all has to evaporate and then it gets crispy. While it\u2019s cooking, occasionally roll the chickpeas around so they cook evenly. Store them in a Tupperware in your pantry. They will only stay crunchy for like 2 days which is when they are best, but you can still eat them after they soft again. That\u2019s why I just make one can at a time, and they never last two days because they are one of those things that you can\u2019t stop eating once you start.", " I agree it's not a lettuce sandwich, but I actually do eat lettuce sandwiches all the time.

Considering it's a whole Tupperware full, this could easily be an additional 300 calories.\n- Chocolates: a nice sweet, only 2 of them so probably doesn't contribute much as far as calories.\n\nIn conclusion, this meal contains all the necessary components of a healthy meal, including *substantial* protein (seriously, do not discount the chickpeas!)
