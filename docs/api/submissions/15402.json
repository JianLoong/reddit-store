Our relationship has been great up until now and we are in it for the longterm. We don't live together yet. My girlfriend lives in an apartment with some roommates while I live in my house that I bought 2 years ago.\n\nAbout 6 months ago my younger sister (19F) started to attend a college in the city about a 20 min walk away from my house. My sister is more introverted and doesn't like the typical college life of living in a dorm with other people and being surrounded by partying and alcohol. Since I live so close by, she asked if she could move in with me for her first year until she meets other people she would be comfortable with sharing an apartment. My house is pretty big so there was no reason not to let her stay with me so she has been living with me for almost half a year. She has her room the 2nd floor that was previously empty while I do pretty much everything on the groundfloor and first floor.\n\nMy girlfriend has been  talking a lot about moving in together recently and I am completely on board with that. We were even making specific plans on when she would be able to move in and everything seemed to be going smoothly until she out of nowhere asked me when I am going to make my sister move out so that she could move in. I told her that my sister will move out eventually but that she isn't moving out for atleast 6 months and might even stay longer if needed and that there is plenty of room for the 3 of us without getting in each other's way.  This somehow riled my gf up and she started telling me that she doesn't want anybody living with us and that my sister needs to be an adult and live on her own. I told her that I made a promise to my sister and that I'm not going back on my word. This turned into an argument with her telling me that she wants us to live alone with nobody else around and me explaining that I can't leave my sister hanging. I tried to reason with her but she kept repeating this so I told her that  I'm not making my sister move out regardless of what she is going to do.

She is your family.\n\nIf someone you have been with for less than a year puts you in a situation where you have to choose between them and an immediate family member,  you absolutely should choose your family.\n\nMy response would have been something like, \"I'd rather not be in a position of having to choose between you and my family, but if you create that situation, of course I will choose my family.\"", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t choose your sister over your girlfriend - you chose them both.  As long as your sister is a good roommate, it\u2019s really unreasonable that your gf wants you to kick her out immediately, especially as there is a planned end date in sight.  Your girlfriend is trying to force an unnecessary dilemma, and she\u2019s not pleased with the result of her forcing you.  Hopefully she\u2019ll take a lesson from that.\n\nIn the first place my husband and I lived together (while we were dating, about 3.5 years into our relationship), a friend of mine ended up in a bad situation.  He was gender nonconforming (mostly female presenting, AFAB but came out as trans after this story takes place) and some of his housemates were hostile enough that he felt absolutely unwelcome and borderline unsafe, especially as he was sleeping in the living room.  He was a recent college grad, so he had no savings and not a lot of options on where to go.  Well, we had a bedroom we weren\u2019t using at all, literally standing empty except for my guest bed, and I cared about my friend, so I asked my husband how he felt about sharing the space.  My husband is deeply introverted, but he had his office that was his own to retreat to, and he\u2019s a decent ally to the LGBTQAI community.  So he said sure, this is your friend and we know they\u2019re not a loud party person, it\u2019ll be fine.  And it was fine.  My friend stayed for a few months, until he saved up a bit and found a shared living space he could afford, with people he knew and felt safe with.  He loved on our dog (who we adopted while he lived with us, after checking that he didn\u2019t mind), he occasionally forgot dishes in the sink, and he was generally a pretty unobtrusive guy who had his own social scene and only occasionally had the odd evening in with us.  Honestly, my only complaint is how he left, but I later found out that wasn\u2019t entirely his fault - you don\u2019t always mind your roommate responsibilities well when you\u2019re having a severe mental breakdown.", "NTA\n\nYour GF doesn't have a good reason for wanting to kick your sister out, especially if your sister is not the \"partying and alcohol\" type.\n\nYou also had the discussion and confirmation with your sister moving in first, it would be an A H move to back out on that without good reason.\n\nYour GF doesn't own the said house and has no say who should and shouldn't be living in it.\n\nIt seems she's already trying to influence you and your assets to get her way. If she can't give a good reason why she wants to live alone with just you, then it is simply her preference and nothing more. If she is NOT willing to compromise, then there is definitely an issue you should address and watch out for. Communication and compromise are 2 very important things to consider in a healthy relationship.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. GF doesn\u2019t live there and as a result doesn\u2019t get to decide who does. If you\u2019d been living with GF and she\u2019d refused to let your sister move in and you overruled her that would\u2026 honestly still make sense because your sister is 19 and needs help and ultimately this is YOUR HOUSE\u2026 but it\u2019d make you a slight AH. Seeing as *girlfriend doesn\u2019t live there* she really doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on here. If she doesn\u2019t want to move in while the sister is there then\u2026 she shouldn\u2019t\u2026 simple as that.", "NTA. Girlfriend sounds controlling. She has her own place with her own roommates\u2026 your sister did not. Since you own your place it\u2019s your say in who is living there. Your gf could easily sign another lease with her current roommates.", "NTA\n\nYes, you are choosing our sister, because she's making you. You are a good brother and a good man with integrity. It's really not a good start of cohabiting with a pertner to force you to break a promise to someone you love, care about, and depends on you. Your gf is AH", "First of NTA, my husband is very much the same probably more. (He and his mom plus his two hs aged sister grew up alone and are very close and have a great amount of dedication to each other)\n\nWe have been married 10 years. With a 8 year old son, and when his sisters need him for any reason, he\u2019s there. The amount of love I have for that man gives me the most joy to extend him grace and support to go when him leaving may cause me certain levels of \u201cbeing put in a sticky/not favorable situation \u201d (like last minute inability to pick up our son from practice or middle of grocery shopping with one vehicle) \n\nSo your gf is just a whinny little cu- you get my point.", "NTA.

If you're anything like me (I'm 32F) you're more in the \"stability is key, I just want to find my peace and hang out there\" life stage so the two of you are going to have to navigate that together or call it quits. You're more emotionally prepared to take a caregiver role (ie with your sister) and she's more ready to spread her wings and take the independence in life that she's probably been craving for a long time. Taking the time to really understand her perspective in terms of a younger person living with roommates might help you empathize with her a bit more, even if you're not wrong.

Either your gf isn\u2019t really looking for a life partner or she lacks the maturity to understand what that means (I suspect the latter). Long term means your family is hers and vice versa, whether good or bad. \n\nHonestly, this is a reason why major age differences in relationships are usually a bad idea.

In my mind, you would be doing her a diservice by letting her continue to stay with you for years.\n\nYour 24 year-old g/f has an expectation of living with her b/f soon (an expectation you also share), and discovering if you two are compatible long-term. Having ANY family member or friends living in that same space complicates this. I don't think your g/f is being an A H. I think she's immature, tbh. I think she's afraid you might be using your sister as a possible excuse to not move in with her (you're not), and therefore, not move your relationship forward because she's 24 and reading into things.

Imo the acceptable responses to that would be \"sure let's move in\" or \"I don't want to move in this early living with your family\" and say no.

U have t been together that long. Slow down", "I agree NTA but living together for the first time and having a third party join you even temporarily can be difficult. When my husband and I first moved in together (after dating 2 years) a friend needed a place to stay and we both agreed he should move in. But it was hard. We were still learning how to live together and now both had a roommate. The girlfriend deserves to feel she has some ownership over her new living situation.

The girlfriend\u2019s reaction is immature at best and manipulative at worst.", "This! I think they need to sit down and talk timelines. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to live with my partner and his sister either no matter how big the house is. I want the freedom to live and f*uck whenever, wherever and how ever I want. You can\u2019t do that living with family.  \ud83e\udd2e however, the way the gf is going about it is childish and immature \ud83e\udd23 but that\u2019s expected of a 24 year old. I don't however think she is some kind of monster for trying to articulate boundaries between their partnership and family.  \n\nIf op wants to make this work he needs to sit down with both of them and have a talk. He needs to let the gf know that he is committed for the rest of the year, but also let the sister know that he would like to move forward with his relationship and she may need to look for other accommodations. At 20 that is a perfectly reasonable ask. I will say that the longer she stays the more impact this will have on his future relationships if he decides to move forward in another direction. As much as I would think it\u2019s sweet and heartfelt to care for your sister, I wouldn\u2019t want to go over there or have relations there until she left.

It may feel that way to you... but this just shows you how much you don't know about your girlfriend.......\n\nDon't move her in.....it's too soon..... You should wait at least 2 years before considering to move in with someone. You need to build a strong foundation first before moving on to that next step.

I think your mistake was making a unilateral decision.  Big decisions have to be two yesses if you're seriously partnered and living together.\n\nI think we're admittedly only in the minority.  Many, if not most, people in western society feel very strongly that new couples need to be alone early on, as far as living situations go, to solidify their relationship.  Your GF clearly feels this way.  You're still in the honeymoon phase, where she might not want to limit intimate encounters to your bedroom, and wants to be able to explore that without having to worry about your sister walking in.  She might also just want to sit with you on the couch watching a movie without having to worry about her coming down.", "It seems like that was an act.

The additional angle that would make me sit up and notice here is that she plans to move into *your* space, that *you* own, and into an existing situation that *you* agreed to - and she is demanding changes before she is even there. What's next - she wants her name on the deed? If you still want to keep the relationship, tell her that moving in will have to wait then, until your sister is out on her own.

Her reaction is awful, yeah, very immature. She's the AH in this situation, but it was a little predictable.", "Good. Keep thinking about it.  Most manipulative people show signs early on, the kind that can be explained away or dismissed - but when you look back you realize you should have taken them seriously. \n\nYou don't need \"a good enough\" reason to end a relationship.

It's a prevalent way of thinking where one is unwilling to commit to some new change simply because they've committed a lot of time, resources, and energy to someone or something.

You're never in too deep to leave, and in many cases you can prepare accordingly for an exit.

I would never want to be with a partner who expected me to screw over a promise I made to a sibling", "NTA but your gf sure is. Good to find out now.", "NTA \u201cwhen are you going to MAKE your sister move out?\u201d Red Flag.  \n\nYou need to see if she can resolve this in her head or together as a couple.  Frankly I\u2019d love to see her stay with you and your sister for a few months to see if any other colors come out.", "NTA.", "NTA \nThe \u201cpartner\u201d should NEVER try to come between you and family. Narcissistic red flag for sure! If she can\u2019t understand a commitment to family, she, herself, will never be fully committed to you. It\u2019s only about her feelings. She clearly cares nothing about your own.", "Nope. Definite NTA. Your girlfriend sounds rather selfish.", "Wow so NTA!  She sounds like the kind of woman who would kick out her own children when they turned 18 because they \"need to be an adult and live on their own.\"  You are helping your sister out.  You made a promise.  It's your house.  Your GF doesn't get to dictate that.", "NTA first of all, it\u2019s your house not your girlfriend\u2019s.  You\u2019ve known your sister and grown up together. You\u2019ve known your girlfriend for a year.  Her assumptions and behaviors are huge red flags.", "You're showing your gf:\n\n* That you value family ties\n* That you're a man of your word\n* That you're willing to compromise\n\nShe's showing you:\n\n* She lacks empathy for your sister's situation\n* She only cares about what you promise HER, not about your obligations to others\n* She doesn't know how to think about short-term discomfort for long-term good. She just wants what she wants now and will emotionally manipulate you to get it.\n\nShe is not your equal in maturity. Do you want to wait for her to catch up?", "NTA.   Based on this post, GF is controlling, immature, and insecure.  I would R-U-N .", "I love my sister in law but I wouldn\u2019t want to live with her, especially in the \u201choneymoon\u201d phase of first living together. So I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong or bad to want that. But the sister was there first, and she\u2019s there for a very good reason. GF needs to accept this or wait until the sister moves out on her own schedule.", "I hope OP rescinds the offer for GF to move in while sister is there. You just know GF would try to drive sister out through mistreatment.", "Good to know your experience, but how is letting his sister live with him choosing family over a social life?", "How is he stringing her along? Letting his sister live with him is a choice for him to make, why does the girlfriend have such a problem with it? What makes you think he\u2019s not ready to live together with his girlfriend?", "Edit 19 years but still.", "Sorry dude, I think she really like your house (and other stability you bring) and doesn't want to share. \nWhen she is showing you her real colors, believe them. \nYou know now she has no sympathy for your younger sister, and would throw her out for her own comfort.", "This.  Not about the sister at all.  It's a control issue.", "Crazy how comedians start a sentence with \"Innit funny how\" then go on to describe an abstract viewpoint that will make you reexamine a formerly mundane concept every time it comes up for the rest of your life.", "Can't run, house doesn't have legs.", "Shoulda sprung for the Baba Yaga upgrade", "The cloaking package or the anti harassment package?", "NTA, and just monitor this. Your GF\u2019s reaction could just be immaturity. It also though could be the personality she\u2019s developing as an adult. Selfish and concerning, trying to isolate you from someone you love and not caring what getting her way does to that loved one. If you keep seeing signs of that, think long and hard about if you want that for the rest of your life.", "NTA. You are lucky to see this side of your GF. Run.", "What does age have to do with any of this?", "24 is old enough not to be an entitled whiner", "A lot. For one, someone a little bit closer to your age would probably realize family is more important than someone who has only been in your life for about a year, or whatever it may be. For two ( not saying this is you mind you) it could be one person wanting to be controlling of the other.", "> When people think they've got you locked in to a relationship (eg by moving in together), they often start showing new sides of their character\n\nThis is why it is often recommended to date for a reasonable period of time before getting married. It sometimes takes a while to get the full picture of someone's personality.", "My gf has, just like me, a college education and a full time job so I don't necessarily see how 'controlling of the other' applies here. We are both independent adults so I don't see why age is a factor here.", "It sounds like she\u2019s trying to assert herself as \u201cwoman of the house\u201d. Like she has an idealized version of what \u201cmoving in together\u201d looks like, and you\u2019re \u201cruining\u201d it for her by allowing your sister to stay. You\u2019re also damaging her sense of entitlement by telling her no and \u201cchoosing your sister\u201d. This behavior doesn\u2019t seem healthy, but I think getting to the bottom of why she\u2019s so against staying with your sister would be a good first step.", ".. did you miss where I said didn\u2019t mean you? Just saying what the age could indicate", "Agreed. At 24  I  would had zero issues with it, but that's an age where people can be very different levels of maturity. Some 24 year old are full on adults, some are very much still \"kids\"", "NTA. A \"gf' has no right to say who lives in your house especially family, sister no less. Run find another girl that will appreciate your relationship with your little sister.", "You didn't choose your sister over your girlfriend, your girlfriend made a nonsensical demand and you chose not to play her games.\n\nNTA", "I agree people can hide who they are. I also think many are waving these big red flags the entire time, but people get so love blind they just never see them.", "Depending on where this is, there\u2019s a good shot the sister would not be able to get a dorm room at this point. If this is in the US, it would also cost thousands of dollars to do so. Not like OP would not be an AH for going back on his word regardless. Also regarding this:\n\n>But this girl who you say you love and are in it for the long term with\n\nIt\u2019s his younger sister. I\u2019m sure he loves his sister at least as much as he loves his girlfriend of not even a year, who is also guaranteed to stick around while the gf might not. In this case, family comes first. He\u2019d be an asshole if he kicked her out. He\u2019s not an asshole for keeping his word, helping out his little sister, and asking his girlfriend (who isn\u2019t even living with him yet) to deal with it for a few months.", "You'll see behavioral changes after major event such as engagement, marriage, baby, and even sex for the poorly thought out individual. Had a girl assumed that it was time for me to \"take responsibility\" for the bills and expenses after she thought we were exclusive because we've been on a few dates. There was no way I was committing because she had about 5 other guys, that I knew of, that were \"just friends\" hanging around. At that point, she did not show any kind of action from her that would've represented for commitment. It was wild with the audacity and entitlement but I think it worked on someone else before with how she acted.", "This is the first step in her thinking she's in charge of you and your house. I get that it would be great to live alone the first time you live together but, they aren't getting a place together. She's moving into his house and now wants to dictate what he can do with it. It's easy to be nice on dates, etc., but, living together is a completely different thing. NTA \n\nI learned this with roommates. Never room with a friend. They have expectations and feel more entitled than a stranger. It's so much easier to deal with someone if you're not afraid of hurting the friendship. \n\nWhen I first moved away for college, I shared a room with my best friend. Until then, I had always had my own room due to being the only girl in the family. I didn't mind sharing so much if my friend wasn't so clingy. We had 2 other roommates and I would be in the living room and want to be alone in our room for a while. She would always follow me. I never had one minute alone unless she was in class or something. I even talked to her about it but she never stopped. She went back to our hometown after 6 months because she was homesick and had a boyfriend there. She had lots of expectations such as always eating together and taking classes together. I was so happy to be away from my controlling mom, I didn't like the fact that she tried to curb my freedom.", "i think you're not understanding my point here", "And I could understand saying that if OP and girlfriend were living together alone and he wanted to move in a family member but the sister is already there and she wanted to kick out sister", "Did you just put your fingers in my peanut butter?", "It's not her WANTING something that makes her the AH, it's how she reacted to not getting her way that does it.", "It isn\u2019t a factor here, but Reddit simply can\u2019t let this age gap stand. Many people here are as immature as your girlfrI end.", "What a power to have!", "You might want to edit your original comment", "NTA. Your sister, if I understand correctly, has been living with you since before you and your girlfriend began discussing living together. And now she expects you to throw your sister out? Your girlfriend sucks. Get a new one. Not even being cheeky. People like her do not make good partners and it will only get worse if you cave to her, not better. Your sister is lucky to have a supportive brother.", "NTA, but maybe its time for a gf closer to your age and values? idk", "Not sure if this will be unpopular opinion but I feel like ESH.\nOn one hand, you promised your sister she could stay her first year of college. You should definitely keep that promise and let her stay another 6 months but after that she should move out. It is NOT unreasonable for your girlfriend to want to live with *just* you. Moving in together with your partner is a really big change, a lot of people w don\u2019t make it past that stage of a relationship bc it can hard to live with a partner and adjust to each others quirks and ways of living. Now this isn\u2019t to say every could is like this, but it is common. Adding another person to the mix definitely had the potential to make it even more difficult. So, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being insane by wanting to live just with you. However, when you told her your sister would be there for at least 6 months she should have understood. You made a promise and intend to keep it. \nBut saying you\u2019ll let her stay however long she wants and therefore prolonging gf being comfortable enough to move in with you is shitty and to me, I would feel like you are prioritizing your sister over the well-being of this relationship and the growth of that relationship.\nI think compromising and letting sis stay for the rest of the year, until she makes friends, is totally reasonable. But after the full year, she should try to find somewhere so that you and gf can take the next step in your relationship.", "Just out of curiosity.  Has she mentioned you putting her on the title of the house after she moves in?", "The sad part is when people see them and stay. I did that, but I\u2019ve healed so I try to encourage people to find someone who deserves them.", "This is true not all colleges can guarantee dorms. The best college here only guarantees dorms for 1st year students and after that it is all by lottery.\n\nGood thing commuting *and* living with family was an option for me!", "Sounds like pretty much of an entitled gold digger", "Why not both?", "NTA, she's your baby sister it is literally your job to take care of her at this stage. That outweighs girlfriends any day. Second, legally, your sister is an adult, yes, but she is a college freshman who doesn't know anyone, so you're keeping her safe, which you should be...", "She just showed her true colors.  She is not mature enough to understand that the house is yours and only yours.", "Age wise the two of you are in very different places.  She has been out of college for a short time and is still figuring out life (roommates and the like) while you bought a house.  She needs to do a lot more growing up before you let her move in.  If she does make sure you get a lease as it is your house.  No tossing any of your items or changing your home and pay some type of rent.", "I\u2018d agree with this but it\u2019s likely that the girlfriend knew about the siblings deal to have the sister stay for at least a year. If that\u2019s the case then the girlfriend would not be entitled to ask about throwing the sister out. The sister lives there already so the girlfriend can decide to either roll with it or postpone moving in until the sister moves out.

Obviously.", "Thanks. I\u2019ve only been on Reddit a couple of weeks and I\u2019m still getting used to it.", "Some people hate Dave Chappelle but he\u2019s honestly fucking brilliant.
