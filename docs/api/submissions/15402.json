Our relationship has been great up until now and we are in it for the longterm. We don't live together yet. My girlfriend lives in an apartment with some roommates while I live in my house that I bought 2 years ago.\n\nAbout 6 months ago my younger sister (19F) started to attend a college in the city about a 20 min walk away from my house. My sister is more introverted and doesn't like the typical college life of living in a dorm with other people and being surrounded by partying and alcohol. Since I live so close by, she asked if she could move in with me for her first year until she meets other people she would be comfortable with sharing an apartment. My house is pretty big so there was no reason not to let her stay with me so she has been living with me for almost half a year. She has her room the 2nd floor that was previously empty while I do pretty much everything on the groundfloor and first floor.\n\nMy girlfriend has been  talking a lot about moving in together recently and I am completely on board with that. We were even making specific plans on when she would be able to move in and everything seemed to be going smoothly until she out of nowhere asked me when I am going to make my sister move out so that she could move in. I told her that my sister will move out eventually but that she isn't moving out for atleast 6 months and might even stay longer if needed and that there is plenty of room for the 3 of us without getting in each other's way.  This somehow riled my gf up and she started telling me that she doesn't want anybody living with us and that my sister needs to be an adult and live on her own. I told her that I made a promise to my sister and that I'm not going back on my word. This turned into an argument with her telling me that she wants us to live alone with nobody else around and me explaining that I can't leave my sister hanging. I tried to reason with her but she kept repeating this so I told her that  I'm not making my sister move out regardless of what she is going to do. She got emotional and started to tell me that I am choosing my sister over her and that what I'm doing is wrong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682152702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uzns5/aita_for_choosing_my_sister_over_my_girlfriend/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this case, you already had a prior commitment that you sister can stay with you for at least her first year.  And that's the living arrangement you already had.

Your sister was in your life first and apparently living in your home first too.

Your sister, on the other hand, is *your sister*.  She is your family.\n\nIf someone you have been with for less than a year puts you in a situation where you have to choose between them and an immediate family member,  you absolutely should choose your family.\n\nMy response would have been something like, \"I'd rather not be in a position of having to choose between you and my family, but if you create that situation, of course I will choose my family.\"", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t choose your sister over your girlfriend - you chose them both.  As long as your sister is a good roommate, it\u2019s really unreasonable that your gf wants you to kick her out immediately, especially as there is a planned end date in sight.  Your girlfriend is trying to force an unnecessary dilemma, and she\u2019s not pleased with the result of her forcing you.  Hopefully she\u2019ll take a lesson from that.\n\nIn the first place my husband and I lived together (while we were dating, about 3.5 years into our relationship), a friend of mine ended up in a bad situation.  He was gender nonconforming (mostly female presenting, AFAB but came out as trans after this story takes place) and some of his housemates were hostile enough that he felt absolutely unwelcome and borderline unsafe, especially as he was sleeping in the living room.  He was a recent college grad, so he had no savings and not a lot of options on where to go.  Well, we had a bedroom we weren\u2019t using at all, literally standing empty except for my guest bed, and I cared about my friend, so I asked my husband how he felt about sharing the space.  My husband is deeply introverted, but he had his office that was his own to retreat to, and he\u2019s a decent ally to the LGBTQAI community.  So he said sure, this is your friend and we know they\u2019re not a loud party person, it\u2019ll be fine.  And it was fine.  My friend stayed for a few months, until he saved up a bit and found a shared living space he could afford, with people he knew and felt safe with.  He loved on our dog (who we adopted while he lived with us, after checking that he didn\u2019t mind), he occasionally forgot dishes in the sink, and he was generally a pretty unobtrusive guy who had his own social scene and only occasionally had the odd evening in with us.  Honestly, my only complaint is how he left, but I later found out that wasn\u2019t entirely his fault - you don\u2019t always mind your roommate responsibilities well when you\u2019re having a severe mental breakdown.", "NTA\n\nYour GF doesn't have a good reason for wanting to kick your sister out, especially if your sister is not the \"partying and alcohol\" type.\n\nYou also had the discussion and confirmation with your sister moving in first, it would be an A H move to back out on that without good reason.\n\nYour GF doesn't own the said house and has no say who should and shouldn't be living in it.\n\nIt seems she's already trying to influence you and your assets to get her way. If she can't give a good reason why she wants to live alone with just you, then it is simply her preference and nothing more. If she is NOT willing to compromise, then there is definitely an issue you should address and watch out for. Communication and compromise are 2 very important things to consider in a healthy relationship.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. GF doesn\u2019t live there and as a result doesn\u2019t get to decide who does. If you\u2019d been living with GF and she\u2019d refused to let your sister move in and you overruled her that would\u2026 honestly still make sense because your sister is 19 and needs help and ultimately this is YOUR HOUSE\u2026 but it\u2019d make you a slight AH. Seeing as *girlfriend doesn\u2019t live there* she really doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on here. If she doesn\u2019t want to move in while the sister is there then\u2026 she shouldn\u2019t\u2026 simple as that.", "NTA. Girlfriend sounds controlling. She has her own place with her own roommates\u2026 your sister did not. Since you own your place it\u2019s your say in who is living there. Your gf could easily sign another lease with her current roommates.", "NTA\n\nYes, you are choosing our sister, because she's making you. You are a good brother and a good man with integrity. It's really not a good start of cohabiting with a pertner to force you to break a promise to someone you love, care about, and depends on you. Your gf is AH", "First of NTA, my husband is very much the same probably more. (He and his mom plus his two hs aged sister grew up alone and are very close and have a great amount of dedication to each other)\n\nWe have been married 10 years. With a 8 year old son, and when his sisters need him for any reason, he\u2019s there. The amount of love I have for that man gives me the most joy to extend him grace and support to go when him leaving may cause me certain levels of \u201cbeing put in a sticky/not favorable situation \u201d (like last minute inability to pick up our son from practice or middle of grocery shopping with one vehicle) \n\nSo your gf is just a whinny little cu- you get my point.", "NAH.
