However, something that has become frustrating is her habit of spending an excessive amount of time taking photos of the things she baked. Like she takes 10 minutes on it. This became more of an issue when she made brownies the other day.\n\nAs soon as the brownies were out of the oven, my other sisters and I wanted some. We started taking a few brownie bites when May saw what we were doing and immediately told us not to touch them until she had taken her photos. I responded by saying, \"You take photos all the time, and I'm sure you have images of brownies somewhere. Just let us eat these now.\"\n\nMy comment upset her, and she insisted that we had no right to eat the brownies without her permission, considering she was the one who made them. she then packed up the brownies in a box and left. Feeling frustrated, I texted her later, calling her selfish for taking the brownies. I argued that since she made them using household ingredients, she had no right to claim them. My other sisters agreed with me, and even our parents, though they didn't want to get involved, sided with us, saying that my sister was overreacting.\n\nSince this May hasn't spoken to me or my other siblings. AITA? I still don\u2019t think I did anything wrong \n\nEdit- goddamn fine I\u2019ll apologize\nEdit 2- Ayo, which one of you called Reddit Care Resources for me", "created_utc": 1686324909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1458g2o/aita_for_calling_my_sister_selfish_over_brownies/", "score": 680, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because as the post is written, there's an awful lot of focus on the household ingredients and not a ton on the time and effort it takes to turn those ingredients into brownies. And if you want to respond to that with \"brownies are easy to make\"...why aren't you making them?           \n     \nUpdate after response: massive YTA. You only thank your sister for her efforts if what she does tastes good to you, and your wording screams of taking advantage of her skills and taking her for granted.     \n    \nEdit: did anyone else read \"The Little Red Hen\" as a kid? Because this is basically that lol. May is the hen and all her sisters are the lazy farm animals who want to eat the end result.", "YTA \n\nSelfish and entitled and greedy. You cant even wait 10 minutes? \n\nShe made those brownies and WOULD SHARE THEM with yall even though you did NOTHING. And you can\u2018t even wait 10 minutes? She gave away 2 hours of her day for those brownies, you cant even wait 10 MINUTES?\n\n\nT E N  M I N U T E S \n\nLOL\n\nYTA", "Yta. She put in time and effort to make the brownies. You and your other sister did nothing. They may be hold hold ingredients but actually it's your parent ingredients because you didn't buy anything so you still have no right to them. You can wait 10 minutes for her to take photos after she once again spend time and effort to make them. You're an entitled child and a jerk of a sibling.", "YTA. Make your own brownies. How greedy and entitled of you to complain about her wanting to photograph her own baked goods. Get over yourself.\n\n> I argued that since she made them using household ingredients, she had no right to claim them\n\nThat is asinine. You need to grow up.", "YTA... if she made them she can also decide when they can be served/eaten.", "YTA. Did you make the brownies? No. So let her take as many pictures as she likes. I hope she never bakes for any of you again.", "YTA - They are her brownies. If she wants 1,000,000 pictures of brownies and this is the 1,000,001st brownie. They are still her brownies.", "Of course YTA.\n\nShe made the brownies, and you horde of selfish locusts swarmed over her and ate them. You didn't make them - she did. She's not selfish for wanting to photograph the brownies that she made - she can do whatever she likes with them, because she made them.\n\nYou and your sisters are absurdly selfish and entitled. I'm not surprised your baking sister has become frustrated with your selfish entitled behavior.", "Yes YTA, your sister made you brownies, it wouldn't have hurt to wait for her to do her thing before digging into them.\n\nI also suspect your parents didn't agree with you per se, if all they said was that they think she overreacted, it doesn't mean they feel you were in the right.", "YTA, if she bakes/cooks for an hour, giving her 10 minutes to take pictures is the least you could do. Pay her $15 an hour and you can eat on your terms.", "YTA, even brownies need to cool after coming out of the oven.  You also gloss over why she is taking pictures.  Obviously, the pictures have some purpose like posting to her social media.  If baking is important to her, then there is an important purpose in promoting it.  There are many cooking blogs/pages/channels, and it can be a successful career.  These pictures are her portfolio.  Would you call someone selfish for not giving away all of their paintings before having a gallery show?  Art is art.  It is not like the brownies will go to waste if you wait an hour.", "How hard is it to wait 10 minutes to eat the brownies? Your sister is proud of the stuff she makes, and obviously a big part of that is documenting the results of her efforts. She spent the time making the brownies, so she should have say over who eats them and when. Everyone has dumb fights with their siblings, but YTA here.", "YTA. Your behavior was rude and entitled.", "YTA, Dang y'all vultures can't wait 15-30 minutes for her to take pictures of what SHE made? Idc if it's household items, y'all werent baking nothing with it", "YTA. she spent time making the brownies and she is allowed to take pictures of them. who cares if she takes a few minutes doing it? you\u2019re 16, not 6. learn some patience.", "YTA. It's her work in the end and you obviously get to enjoy it too, is it that hard to wait for a few more minutes until you can eat them? Even if your parents bought the ingredients, what she did for you is free labour. When you buy brownies from the store be sure the price includes the ingredients + the labour. You should apologize and thank her for cooking for you and even offer to help her with the photos in exchange for those free brownies. This is a really great hobby she has, that benefits your whole family and you should be more supportive.", "YTA. Make your own brownies", "Yta, she's probably taking so long getting the perfect picture because she's proud of them.  What you said probably hurt her feelings, you should apologize.", "She made them! She hadn\u2019t even offered them to you yet! Make your own fkn brownies. YTA", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t owe you *any* brownies. If she wants she can bake the tray, take photos for three hours and then slowly eat the entire tray herself while you and your rude sisters watch. Stop being horrible and entitled.", "YTA. Bold of you to say that household ingredient  line considering 1) you didnt pay for them, and 2) she\u2019s in the household! She has every right to use household ingredients for her own stuff! \n\nIf you made yourself a bowl of cereal or something and she just came up and took it from you because \u201cwell the cereal and milk are for the householddd\u2026 you have no right to claim them!!\u201d You, just like every other person, would be angry/annoyed. Same concept, except the brownies were made with serious effort and not in 2 seconds.", "YTA. Did you purchase the household ingredients?\n\nDid you pay her for her labor in making them?\n\nDid you pay for the materials she used for baking, the mixing bowl, measuring spoons, the baking pan?\n\nDid you pay for the oven?\n\nI think you get my point. The statement \u201chousehold ingredients so she has no right to claim them\u201d is a very slippery slope. You also have no right to claim them.\n\nIf you want brownies readily accessible whenever you want them make them or buy them yourself. At 16 you are old enough to learn that you are not entitled to someone else\u2019s food.", "Yta\n\nYou are the most 4 year old 16 year old in the world.\n\n10 minutes isn't excessive to take pictures.\n\nCalm the hell down and control your impulse. Brownies need to cool anyway.", "Yta. It may have been household ingredients but it was her time skill and effort. You could have waited the ten minutes for her to take her photos. You were selfish and greedy and acting like a spoiled 3 year old. Me want brownies me want dem now. Gimmeee Gimme gimme wahhhhhhh!\nMake your own damn brownies brat", "YTA. Just because you don't empathize with her desire to take just the right picture doesn't mean it's not a valid desire. I'm a professional baker, and I got my start as a teenager making brownies at home. I get it. \n\nAlso, brownies aren't best right out of the oven. Give them 10-25 minutes to set and become warm instead of piping hot. You can't taste any complexity of flavor when they're fresh out of the oven.", "YTA.  May baked, she asked for a few minutes so she can photograph, yet none of you had a wisp of self control.  Just BACK OFF from the baked goods, you\u2019ll get some eventually.  If I was May I would not bake anything for you if you couldn\u2019t respect my efforts enough to give me a little time.", "YTA. You knew that she would be taking pictures, which is her right. She made them and you could've at least waited. You did not take the time to make them and if you would've just been patient, you would've gotten some brownies. Maybe next time take the time to make your own brownies.  You didn't have to act like a brat. It would not have made much of a difference for you to wait 5 minutes. Like you said it took her about 2 hours to make these, so have some courtesy and let her take the pictures.", "YTA Your sister clearly loves baking and she took the time and made the effort to make these brownies. It sounds like she would\u2019ve shared the brownies had you all waited for her to take the pictures she wanted to. I have three sisters myself and if they did what you guys did to her, I would have been furious. Definitely you guys are TA.", "You had no right to eat the brownies without her permission, considering she was the one who made them. She had every intention of letting you eat them, she just wanted you to wait until they had cooled a bit and she had taken her photos. If you can't wait *(gasp!)* **10 whole minutes** for brownies, make your own.\n\nYTA.", "yta. you're the selfish one. 10 minutes really isnt a long time to wait.", "YTA, make your own brownies if you want to dictate how they are made.\n\nYour sister was doing a fun and kind thing sharing her hobby and you have shown nothing but entitlement and selfishness.\n\nYTA", "YTA and so are your sisters. Oh, poor baby, you have to wait ten minutes. So what? You and your greedy sisters pigged out on the brownies; you stuffed your faces with them after not lifting a finger to help your sister bake them. Did you even leave your sister any brownies? You assholes are so selfish. And it's not like you paid for the ingredients either. You just sat on your ass, whined, and then stuffed your greedy face with the brownies while making your sister feel bad about yourself. Then you got your asshole sisters to gang up on her for you. I hope she never bakes for you selfish assholes again.", "Can't believe you came here, wrote that all out, maybe even proof read it and still think you are not an asshole, May should post this in r/entitledpeople \n\nYTA", "She did the work to make the brownies. It sounds like you\u2019re the one who\u2019s selfish, demanding to eat them immediately though you did no work to make them. You need to work on your sense of entitlement.", "YTA. \n\nWhy does she not have the right to take pictures of something SHE made and is proud of? Have you ever considered that maybe she uses the photos for some sort of baking portfolio or blog? Baking is obviously a hobby of May's and she takes the \"excessive\" photos to document her work. You sound embarrassingly entitled and need to get over yourself.", "Yta this would be buried with all the yta but you are so spoilt demanding others peoples cooking\n\nIf she wants to spend an hour taking photos its up to her\n\nIf she doesnt share her cooking with others until 2 or 3 hours later cause she sees about giving it to others first thats up to her", "YTA, they are her brownies and you don't get to have any say over them at all. If you want brownies immediately out of the oven make some yourself. Stop dimming her joy for your own gratification.", "YTA. Make your own brownies!", "You couldn't wait 10 minutes for your sister to give you something of hers that she made so you stole some instead, something that wasn't yours, something you were not entitled to and you think SHE is the selfish one?\n\nYeah, YTA", "YTA\n\nDid you bake them? No? Then guess what, you don't get to just snatch them up. Calling May selfish for wanting some pictures and refusing to share her work with you is uncalled for. Go make your own damn brownies next time.", "YTA and your sisters.  Go bake your own frigging brownies!  The entitlement is deep here.", "YTA. \n\nI frequently bake, and it was understood by people a decade younger than you that the cook is the one who says when everyone else can have the baked good. It's a ton of effort to make things from scratch, and yes, some of us want to take pictures, either for social media or to keep a record of what we baked when.\n\nAnd, honestly, *the reason doesn't matter*. I could force everyone to wait because I wanted the first slice and I wasn't hungry yet, and that's my prerogative. \n\nAs for \"household ingredients,\" one thing you'll learn as you get older is that *labor is worth more than the parts*. She'd put more into the brownies than anyone, and I'd say your 'contribution' still sat at zero, since I doubt you're the one buying pantry items.", "YTA - and so is your sister and your parents.  Sure the household items were used.  But she is the one who spent the time putting the household items together and baking them.  You all didn't do a damn thing and yet you are still expecting something.  You all are acting like spoiled children, even your parents.  You want a brownie so bad, make it your damn self.  Like your sister did.  Stop acting spoiled and entitled and do better.  All of you.", "YTA, you didnt bake them. you had no right to eat them.", "YTA and your parents are too. Tell them they have been judged and found to be arseholes.\n\nThey ain\u2019t yours, if she wanted to mount them like a hunting trophy and leave them there forever then that\u2019s her prerogative (prerogative essentially means choice, guessing that will be over your head given how moronic you\u2019d have to be to think this needs AITA to resolve)", "YTA and a spoiled brat.   You not only feel entitled to the brownies but think that you could do it if only you had the motivation to actually make something yourself?   It only takes 2 hours, get cooking.\n\n\nYour sister is probably dreaming of when she is out of the house and can say you can't ever have her cooking again.", "So you are rude, snarky and ungrateful. Can tell why you picked your username, it fits. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You don't just get to take food someone else made without asking. You definitely don't get to call someone selfish for wanting you to wait to eat food she didn't even make for you.

Next time make your own brownies.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t make them or contribute in any way but you think she\u2019s selfish for not letting you gorge yourself on what she made. Leave her alone your bullying her to get free treats you should make yourself", "YTA she doesn\u2019t have to share what she makes. This is her hobby. \n\nYou will not starve waiting 10 minutes for her to take her pictures. She deserves that respect if she is going to share her treats.\n\nIf you want brownies immediately bake your own.", "YTA.

How would you feel if you spent time making a dress, had plans for a photo shoot, and then you came home to one of your sisters wearing it and getting it all wrinkly?  You wouldn't have had the brownies to eat if she hadn't spent the time preparing them, so what's with the attitude of having to wait for something that she took the time to do? It sounds like you and your sisters need to start truly putting yourself in her shoes instead of ganging up on her.  If this is a common occurrence (ganging up on her) she might be even more offended/hurt when you ruin something of hers, or think you did it on purpose to cause her more distress.  Haven't you ever seen Cinderella?  It's cruel and hurtful to isolate, but even worse when you take something they worked hard on and then get mad at them for getting mad at you for it.", "YTA.
