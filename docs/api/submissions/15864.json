We're technically on a 'break' atm but I can't stop thinking about whether or not I did the right thing, maybe I should have stayed and planned a bit better and been a bit more graceful as he still has a full time job that he likes back home.\n\nHis family has since gotten involved and are essentially calling me trash for abandoning.him, his mum has called me 23 times in the past 3 weeks but I can't bring myself to speak to her as I know she will shout at me.", "created_utc": 1682639152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131bgno/aita_for_moving_overseas/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All details aside, you wanted to move and he didn't so you moved and he didn't. You're both grown, can't abandon a grown person. He was invited to join you and chose not to. It's up to you to decide if you are happier with him in NZ or without him in Australia.", "First off, block their numbers. \nYour boyfriend didn\u2019t want to leave NZ. Totally fine. You wanted to leave NZ. Totally fine also. \n\nYou did what was best for you. Well done! \nYou didn\u2019t abandon him, he chose to stay behind. \nAnd honestly, you dodged a bullet.", "NTA and I think you should consider this relationship over. \n\nIf it were him calling you and asking for compromise that would be one thing, but his mum? Seriously, you're better rid of that. In any case, he's allowed to make the choice that his job and home matter more to him than you do, just as you've made the other choice.", "NTA. Winning the chicken game is good.", "NTA. Either he changed his mind or was really clueless about something important to you.  Regardless of which, you have learned that he's not the partner for you.\n\nRemember that you are the most important person in your life.", "NTA - You are 22, don't let him drag you down. Live your life, have fun, meet someone who has similar goals as you, as he obviously does not.", "Ugh definitely do not pick up when his mom calls.\n\nIt sounds like your bf wanted to end the relationship but is too chicken. I'd just cut off the entire lot of them.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You guys talked about it for a year. It sounds like he got cold feet.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is gaslighting you.\n\nThat said, people are weird about long distance moves.  My wife and I moved from the Midwest to SoCal when we were 23.  We had a going away party and gave away all the stuff we were not taking, like couches and chairs, etc.\n\nThe day we were packing the U-Haul, some friends came over and were surprised.  They didn't think we were really moving.\n\n\"Guys, we had a going away party.  Jeff, We gave you our couch because it's to ig to move\"  \n\nThey thought we were joking or something. \n\nAnyway, been in SoCal for 29 years now, and it's WAY better than the Midwest.", "NTA, notably you say \"we made plans and put everything into place\" either he is so ignorant of reality that he doesn't notice everything that goes into moving or he is gaslighting you for whatever reason.  Niether scenario speaks well of someone you'd want to build a life with.  No matter where you live there is a lot of prep that goes into moving to a completely different country.  Block him and his entire family, and based on their reaction and claiming that you \"abandoned\" him I now lean more towards gaslighting of the two options and that he learned it from them.", "NTA", "NTA, but I am curious, what kind of plans were being put in place? Like how was it possible for him to misconstrue them as dreaming out loud and joking around. Surely yall must have been applying for places to live and jobs and interviewing and saving money for a move.", "NTA - You didn't abandon an almost 30yr old man with a full time job. You moved, he choose to stay. Mommy needs to stay in her lane, it's not her business what you do in your life. Her calling you that much to bitch and complain is honestly...embarrassing.", "NTA. Don\u2019t feel bad about his job, if he wanted to move he would\u2019ve been looking for one in Australia. MoveOn, my friend, you\u2019ll be happier. Break ups suck, but you don\u2019t want to be with a person whose mom yells at you anyway. That\u2019s just not normal.", "\n22 is a great age to have experiences like living overseas. 6 years isn\u2019t a huge age difference in your 40\u2019s, but your bf is at a time when he\u2019s probably establishing himself in his field and you\u2019re really just starting out. It may be much easier for you to make big changes like this. From what you described, it doesn\u2019t sound like your bf gaslit you. More like he just got cold feet.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear from your post how long you\u2019ve been together, and that\u2019s important info. It sounds like you\u2019re pretty involved in his family (I sure hope so with the mom calling 23 times, yeesh). \n\nYou\u2019re going to have to accept them seeing you as the asshole, though,; they love your bf and don\u2019t want to see him suffer. \n\nI don\u2019t consider you the AH here because you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You didn\u2019t elope with another man, or lie about your intentions. Seems like you\u2019ve been honest and consistent. \n\nNTA although it sure sucks for your bf.", "NTA\n\nDon't stunt your life for any man in the world, especially at your age. He gaslit you. Go find someone else and get to enjoy life as you want it.", "Yeah kinda the asshole. If he cared about you then he would have eventually came around and moved with you when he was ready. But he wasn't.You should've waited for when he was. Moving to another country is a big commitment, and trying to force someone to make that commitment isn't cool.", "YTA. If you love eachother enough to be considering moving overseas together, away from support of family and friends, you should be willing to discuss the situation and come to an agreement that doesn't mean splitting up.

Yeah, don't use an ultimatum you don't mean, and don't go all hyperbolic on ultimatums in order to manipulate someone, but that's not what you're doing.\n\nIf you've made a decision about something major, and your partner isn't sure about going along with it, you're entitled to make decisions for yourself, and it's hard not to frame it as an ultimatum. You have decided to leave, he's waffling, how the heck else are you supposed to handle this? \n\nAnd I gotta agree with everyone here - this grown man is having his mommy call you? Hell nah.

Your boyfriend told you at the last minute that he didn\u2019t intend on moving. And that sucks. But take it one day at a time for now. Try and find things that you enjoy. You\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re perfectly fine on your own in the country you moved to. You\u2019ll have all these great memories to look back on.

Best to cut the ties and enjoy .\n\nHowever I think you got the move backwards. If I had to choose It would be new Zealand every time!", "Umm seems like this was a move you wanted more than him and thats why you two are in different countries. Also sounds like bad communication. You two both should have been on the same page about such a drastif move like going overseas. Did you make it clear this was a joke? Idk. Did he know about these plans or choose to ignore it? Idk\n\nYou can go and do whatever you want when single, but in a relationship you have to consider your partner with such a big change or you break up. But who knows maybe you're meant to break up and a find a new life? If so just break up honestly so you both can move on.", "NTA, also, taking into account the age gap, I think you're better off.", "Not much of a move. Australia and New Zealand are practically the same county", "NTA. A high school friend and I dreamed of moving in together. She goes to college in one state, I go to technical school in a different state (in U.S.). We make plans to move in together when I finish as I'm finishing in two years.\n\nThis is pre cellphones so it is all letters and weekly phone calls. For a full six months, we talk weekly about what we are going to do. She is living with her mum still and she is the one who talks about where we can live that we can afford -she's handling the apartment search. I finish up the school, pack up my stuff, quit the part-time job I was doing (which offered me full-time) to pay for my school, hop a plane, and go to her state. \n\nAll this is known and we talk about it and it's part of the plan. And then the foot dragging starts happening. I'm staying with her and her mum. End of week one, \"Not yet, we'll go look at things next week\". End of week two, \"No, I'm not in the mood, let's wait a while.\" Beginning of week three, I point out that I need to know where we are going to live so I can find a convenient job (no car) and can we please start looking at these places she told me about. No, she says, but I should just get a job and then I can find a place. By myself.\n\nAnd that's when she tells me that ... she has no intention of moving in with me. She never did. She wanted to stay with her mom who cooked her meals, did her laundry, and still took care of \"her little girl\". \n\nI have never been as angry with someone as I was then. I left a place I liked. I left a job I liked. All based on \"we are going to move in together.\" And she was like, \"yeah, but if I told you that, you wouldn't come and I wanted you to have a place so I could come over when bored or angry with my mom.\" And that made perfect sense to her. \n\nI left two days later (it took that long to figure out where to go next and what to do and get a ticket). She continued to be confused as to why I would be upset that she lied to me since it was clearly to her benefit. UGH.", "I\u2019ve upvoted but shouldn\u2019t your judgement be NAH, unless you are including the mom cuz she is definitely an AH", "You were with a guy 6 years older than you, that not only broke his word, but now has also involved his mom in your break up. So...no, the only thing you lost is dead weight. If you continue with him, marry him or have children with him, you can also predict that your MIL will be calling you a lot more. Enjoy your freefom and your youth ;)"]}
