She goes to college in one state, I go to technical school in a different state (in U.S.). We make plans to move in together when I finish as I'm finishing in two years.\n\nThis is pre cellphones so it is all letters and weekly phone calls. For a full six months, we talk weekly about what we are going to do. She is living with her mum still and she is the one who talks about where we can live that we can afford -she's handling the apartment search. I finish up the school, pack up my stuff, quit the part-time job I was doing (which offered me full-time) to pay for my school, hop a plane, and go to her state. \n\nAll this is known and we talk about it and it's part of the plan. And then the foot dragging starts happening. I'm staying with her and her mum. End of week one, \"Not yet, we'll go look at things next week\". End of week two, \"No, I'm not in the mood, let's wait a while.\" Beginning of week three, I point out that I need to know where we are going to live so I can find a convenient job (no car) and can we please start looking at these places she told me about. No, she says, but I should just get a job and then I can find a place. By myself.\n\nAnd that's when she tells me that ... she has no intention of moving in with me. She never did. She wanted to stay with her mom who cooked her meals, did her laundry, and still took care of \"her little girl\". \n\nI have never been as angry with someone as I was then. I left a place I liked. I left a job I liked. All based on \"we are going to move in together.\" And she was like, \"yeah, but if I told you that, you wouldn't come and I wanted you to have a place so I could come over when bored or angry with my mom.\" And that made perfect sense to her. \n\nI left two days later (it took that long to figure out where to go next and what to do and get a ticket).

You two want to be in different places and that's just how it is.\n\nI had a similar situation in my early 20s. After a few painful months trying to make it work, we decided to call it quits. A couple of years later I met the man of my life and we're still together after 10+ years. Being in this relationship has made me see all the incompatibilities that I had with my ex. Many things that I was aware of, but chose to ignore, that would have become bigger and bigger problems if we had stayed together. \n\nI know it's hard to end a relationship with a person that you love. I know because I did it. But it takes more than love to make it work, because relationships aren't pop songs or fairy tales. You need compatibility on key issues. And by clinging on to an incompatible partner, you end up missing opportunities to find a more compatible one.", "I mean, I guess it's technically overseas...\n\nNTA.", "NTA, he got cold feet and tried to gaslight you into giving up your dreams.

If you were to go back, they wouldn't forgive you; they'd hold this over your head forever.  They'd also continue to be involved in every decision you and bf ever make.

He fully acknowledges having those discussions with her, just not actually being serious about it.   Again, not gaslighting.\n\nFurthermore, she discussed \"making plans\" but glossed over the details on that.  It's also clear that whatever plans she might have made, it wasn't made with a specific timeframe, therefore she couldn't make real plans like purchasing or renting property, applying for jobs, scheduling movers, etc.. all the things that are actually involved in planning to move.  Anything less than that is just glorified window shopping, and I can absolutely see him just nodding along as she scouts out places she might want to live.\n\nSounds more like she was at the \"ready to go\" phase and he was still at the \"someday it might be nice\" phase.", "He burned the bridge, not you. He spent the last year planning an international move with you he had no intention of following through with and then when you went without him, he went crying to his mummy to get her to guilt you for \"abandoning her precious baby\". You didn't abandon anyone. He chose to stay behind, and you chose to leave and live your life. He can't handle the fact that you were braver than him to take a chance and step outside your comfort zone.\n\nAs soon as his mother started calling you, that relationship was dead, grieve the loss, then start to move forward. \n\nAs an Aussie, Welcome. You got this, and I'm sure you will make a lot of AMAZING friends in no time. NTA"]}
