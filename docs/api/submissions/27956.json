Bit of a weird situation and I\u2019m not sure if I am TA or not. Happy to have my perspective challenged.\n\nLast week I was taking a 12 hour flight that I had booked months in advance. At the time of booking I paid extra to choose my seats. The seat I chose was $55 extra and right at the front of the plane (trying to arrive somewhere on time upon landing). The seat also happened to be an extra legroom seat and I am a 4\u201911 female.\n\nI check in, board, sit in my seat as usual, but as soon as the seatbelt sign was switched off I had a man come over and ask to change seats. The first time he asked politely saying that he is 6\u20194 and flying is painful for him can we please change seats. I was open to it until I saw that his seat was way in the back of the plane and so I told him no sorry I paid extra to sit up front. He kind of got increasingly mad and wouldn\u2019t leave saying that there\u2019s no reason someone of my height needs extra legroom (I told him I paid to be upfront). I suggested that he ask the other people in those seats if they could swap but he refused saying that he wouldn\u2019t want to bother other men or split up couples. He kept getting rude and angry so I just called over a flight attendant who told him to go sit down. For the rest of the flight he would walk past for no reason slamming into me (I was sitting aisle).\n\nWas I in the wrong? Should I have swapped with him?

OP was totally in their right to say no ESPECIALLY AS THEY PAID EXTRA and tall person does not have the right to be a jerk about it.  Did tall guy offer OP to reimburse her for the extra amount paid?

Bit of a weird situation and I\u2019m not sure if I am TA or not. Happy to have my perspective challenged.\n\nLast week I was taking a 12 hour flight that I had booked months in advance. At the time of booking I paid extra to choose my seats. The seat I chose was $55 extra and right at the front of the plane (trying to arrive somewhere on time upon landing). The seat also happened to be an extra legroom seat and I am a 4\u201911 female.\n\nI check in, board, sit in my seat as usual, but as soon as the seatbelt sign was switched off I had a man come over and ask to change seats. The first time he asked politely saying that he is 6\u20194 and flying is painful for him can we please change seats. I was open to it until I saw that his seat was way in the back of the plane and so I told him no sorry I paid extra to sit up front. He kind of got increasingly mad and wouldn\u2019t leave saying that there\u2019s no reason someone of my height needs extra legroom (I told him I paid to be upfront). I suggested that he ask the other people in those seats if they could swap but he refused saying that he wouldn\u2019t want to bother other men or split up couples. He kept getting rude and angry so I just called over a flight attendant who told him to go sit down. For the rest of the flight he would walk past for no reason slamming into me (I was sitting aisle).\n\nWas I in the wrong? Should I have swapped with him?

He was being a big baby. I'm 6'8\" and I would never act like that, or expect anyone to move after they chose a seat.\n\n\nHowever...I believe extra legroom seats should be reserved for those of us with extra legs. I try to plan as far ahead as possible. I happily pay extra $$$ for more room, and I avoid certain airlines. BUT extra room is a commodity and there isn't enough of those seats to go around. It is super annoying to see someone like you sitting there when you attempted to buy the same seat. Not your fault, but I physically cannot fit in a regular seat.", "That guy is human trash.", "NTA he saw you as an easy target to steal your $55.\n\nI'm really glad you didn't give in well done", "NTA. I'm taller than that dude and (usually) just pay extra for the leg room. I have sometimes either been unable to (short notice or my boss booked), and nicely asked the gate crew if they could sort something out, and they almost always do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, we can get into the whole morality of \"should tall people have to pay extra to fly\" (some places consider it a disability or special access needs, over certain heights you actually can't physically fit into airplane seats) but the long and the short of it is, you *did* pay extra, and speaking from the viewpoint of having given my own extra legroom (paid for) seat up before to let a mother and child sit together, the correct action is to approach the crew, not the individual passenger. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, if you spoke to the crew about it, they could actually have orchestrated the swap between you two, as well as ensuring you were one of the first to deplane (they do it all the time for people with connecting flights), and you really can't underestimate how painful those 14 hours will be for him, and the next 24-36 hours after. Next time, just ask the crew.", "NTA - I didn't even have to read the entire thing. You paid for your seat at the front. It does not matter why you paid the extra.
