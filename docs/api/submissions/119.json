Iv tried to talk to him about this but he refuses to come upstairs and claims I\u2019m stressing him out. He says I need to relax and that he\u2019s only been here 2 weeks and to give him a break. My husband and I are going on vacation out of state soon and I\u2019m honestly uncomfortable with leaving my uncle here alone. He is a bad drunk and he lies about anything and everything.

Regardless of the outcome right now, you don\u2019t want to find yourself in a pickle later.", "NTA and you need to be quick about understanding tenants rights because it sounds like he is planning to screw you over and you would be surprised how much squatters can get away with and for how long.", "You need to figure out the local laws and evict him NOW before he establishes residency there\n\nAlso CANCEL THE TRIP if he is still in your home.  Otherwise you are liable to come home to the locks changed and a squatters situation on your hands\n\nNTA", "NTA but you need to nip this shit while you still have a legal leg to stand on. Depending on MO's tenancy laws you could already be nearing the point of him establishing residency. It takes as little as two weeks and a piece of mail addressed to you to establish residence in some states, so act quickly. The last thing you want is a drawn out eviction process in order to remove your uncle from your basement.", "NTA Get him out now.  2 weeks and he's already causing you problems.", "NTA, your uncle is freeloading. I\u2019m sure there are homeless shelters around you. You are not responsible for your uncle. He will stay there and use you until you kick him out.", "NTA\n\nAnd may i suggest, dont phrase it like \"get out by by the time we go on vacation in 3 weeks\".\n\nBecause, lets assume he says \"ok ok, i will\"\n\nAnd when the due date comes, he wont...\n\nYou will be stuck, cause you wouldnt wanna cancel your vacation, and wouldnt wanna leave the house with him in it.\n\nTalk to your mom/dad (your uncle's sibling).\n\nHe's a grown ass man that feels too comfortable with your generosity.\n\nA 2 week ultimatum, and involve other members of your family.", "NTA. Don\u2019t sugarcoat either - be blunt and to the point, so there isn\u2019t wiggle room or confusion. Tell him you did him a favor, and he repaid you by blocking your access to part of your own home, so it\u2019s not going to work out. Maybe give him less time than the 3 weeks so you\u2019re not in a time crunch to get him out before you leave.", "NTA. You have every right to feel comfortable that your house is safe while you are away.  You've given your uncle time and he is just showing his true intentions by not doing anything.", "NTA. It is your home. Do NOT leave him in your home unattended! Also, if he stays so long, ( and it varies from place to place) you may have a hard time getting him out. Is he using other substances? I ask because that is another liability. I do hope you have cameras and if he knows you are going away I would strongly suggest you have neighbors watch your house, get a few lightbulb cameras for when you are gone. He is wrong.", "Do NOT leave him alone in your house. Give him two weeks notice, then have him physically removed and change the locks. Make sure you tell local law enforcement about the situation. You might have to cancel your holiday...", "NTA. He is denying you access to a room in your house. He is refusing to get a job, and disrespecting you in your own home. Let him go to a shelter. While 2 weeks may not be enough time to already start working at a job, depending on availability in your area, it is more than enough time to be making an effort and to be putting in applications, as well as applying for assistance programs. And under no circumstances should he be locking himself away and denying you access to your office and your papers/documents/workspace. You can respect his privacy and not snoop through his stuff in his room on your way to the office.", "NTA. You've been more than fair. He needs to go.", "NTA  \n\n\nif his presence is preventing you from accessing an area of your house that is pefect grounds for kicking him out", "People should be more responsible about their life. NTA\n\nYou given him a chance but look at this. I would say he should leave. He shouldn't stay alone in your home.", "Not the asshole, it's okay to set boundaries. But he did relocate from the other side of the country. So you might want to give him like 30 days since it takes a little bit longer to find a job. That said, if he's not looking, giving him an extra week won't make a difference.", "NTA, get him out now or he will never leave.", "NTA. Just no. Tell him to leave in a week max. Two days. Tomorrow. Either he pays rent and can have a say or he is a guest and have to leave the minute you say so.", "Don't give him any notice. Next time he goes out for drinks with friends, change the locks, pack up his stuff, text him that he is no longer welcome and when he can pick up his stuff. NTA. This is a situation that can turn bad really quickly. Talk to your parent who is his sibling about the situation.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to act quicker than that, in many jurisdictions someone becomes a resident after living somewhere for 30 days regardless of if they've paid rent or have a contract - if that happens you will likely have to formally evict him which will take months.", "NTA.  I'm not sure why you took this man in to begin with, especially if you knew he was a bad drunk.  Unless he's been mangled by a horrific accident, a 46 year old man is capable enough to find his own lodgings. Your condition of \"until he got on his feet\" was doomed from the beginning.  If a 46 year old hasn't gotten on their feet yet, they probably won't ever do it.", "NTA\n\nYou were trying to help him out and he has taken this for granted and basically thrown it back in your face - people's patience has a limit.", "You urgently need legal help. He's already lived in your house for 2 weeks. Delaying past the 1 month mark might give him tenant rights, depending on local laws. He needs to be gone ASAP. \n\nBut get legal advice RIGHT NOW to make sure to do it without putting yourself in the wrong. Don't delay!!", "NTA: If he doesn't know you're going on vacation I'd keep that information from him. Who's to say he won't break in while you're gone.\n\nHe's your guest, but he's not allowing you access to your office, which you need to work? I don't know I'd give him any notice at all, just a \"get out now\".\n\nNow, as far as getting a job, I can understand if he wants to take a week to know the area and research job opportunities, but he doesn't sound like he's ever going to look for one.", "I mean... Based on him locking you out of your office NTA but I've got to admit I'm a little weirded out about you telling him that he can stay with you \"until he gets back on his feet\" and blaming him for not being able to find a job *within a couple of weeks*, and wanting him to move out after just 2 weeks... Weren't you aware of these habits and his personality when you decided to let him stay? I feel like there's more to this story", "NTA. Kick him out now.", "NTA\n\nThere is no way I would leave this guy in my home unsupervised.  You have a good chance of coming back to find it trashed and/or valuables missing.  Bad behaviors come in bundles.", "NTA, kick him out immediately. Not sure how he can possibly be getting alcohol if he doesn't have a job to pay for it, but I would be very concerned about how he's getting any money to pay for booze. Is he on your wifi? If so, change the password immediately and don't give him the new one. If you can't unlock the guest room door, hire a locksmith to come and do it for you, then remove the door to the room so that you can access your office.\n\nDo it now", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKick him out FAST. Getting him out will take time, and you will need to involve the police.", "Nta he needs to go change the locks to and get cameras. If you leave him on his own you probably wont beable to get into your own home.", "NTA. yeah kick him out immediately.  in most states, 30 days is enough to establish tenancy.  You don't want to deal with the legal headache of a squatter with rights.  \n\n\nKick the door down, and put his stuff outside.  Change the locks.  You need to do this before his 30 days are up.", "NTA.  Have him legally evicted.  you have to be heartless in this situation to save yourself and your marriage.  If family says anything, tell them to get their butts there to pick him up and if they are not going to, tell them to shut up.", "Do not let him stay there any longer or you will have to go through eviction legal processes to get him kicked out!!!!   30 days can screw you out of your own home if not less.", "NTA  Check your local laws.  Here is a link of state by state guest/tenant laws.[https://www.apartments.com/rental-manager/resources/article/when-does-a-guest-become-a-tenant](https://www.apartments.com/rental-manager/resources/article/when-does-a-guest-become-a-tenant)\n\nIf you can, have him removed by the police for trespassing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then he had too bad anxiety, but then goes to get drinks and meet new friends. There was no way I could have predicted the level of disrespect he\u2019s shown. I honestly think it\u2019s cause I\u2019m so much younger than him he thinks he can control and manipulate. I thought doing this nice thing for him, he would be more appreciative and now I feel he saw an opportunity to use someone younger than him. I never thought he could be this disrespectful or i would have never told him to come out here", "Depending on where you live, he might eventually yes.

Time is of the essence.", "It's usually a minimum of 30 days, after that you have to go through the courts, as of now he's still considered a guest in most places, so get him out now.

Just get him out of your house. If you have to pay for a hotel for a week just to have him gone.

Nice of you to help.
