For context, our kids take a lot of our time and we both work demanding jobs (I often end up working 60 to 70h per week) which makes it difficult to manage to stay on top of everything (house chores, kids, work, social activities etc.). We split responsibilities and whoever\u2019s having an easier work week will naturally do more at home and so our dynamic works well for us but we\u2019ll still often fall behind - especially on house chores.on top of our very busy lives, I recently found out I was pregnant, which was a surprise we weren\u2019t ready for. We\u2019re very excited about the baby but it will for sure add it\u2019s load on our barely manageable routines. \n\nMy oldest\u2019s birthday was approaching. He has been fascinated by animals ever since he was 2. Nothing gives him pleasure as animal-related books, toys, clothes, zoo trips etc. He\u2019s a really good kid and so we fed into his passion and have been constantly getting him animal related gifts. I was at my parents recently and they were discussing what to get him for his birthday. That\u2019s when my sister said, she knows exactly how to get him the animal gift of his dreams. I immediately understood she was planning on gifting him a living animal. I told her absolutely not and that we cannot handle being responsible for another living being with our busyness. I have never had any pets when I was growing up and so it\u2019s not natural for me to take care of pets. We had told the kids that they could get one once they were old enough to take care of it. The subject was closed and never brought up again.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, we were opening gifts and all of a sudden my sister stood and said she had one last surprise. That\u2019s when she brought in a huge cage with a bird. My husband and I were shocked as we had made it clear we didn\u2019t want any pets. My son got excited for about 10 mins and then carried on playing and never looked at it again. Although I was extremely pissed, I didn\u2019t make a scene and just ignored the whole thing as we had lots of friends over. \n\nThe next day, I talked to my son and said we couldn\u2019t keep it because it needed attention and we couldn\u2019t give it proper care currently. I said we could give it back to his aunt and he can go see it there whenever he wanted. He immediately agreed and so I called my sister and told her to pick it up as we were clear we didn\u2019t want it. \n\nShe\u2019s now mad saying it\u2019s an expensive bird and she spent lots of money on the gift.

She is yes very messy and as she's a lone bird needs lots of attention and playtime as I'm her flock. Birds hide illness and count as exotic pets, so it can be harder to find a vet. She can also be very noisy. You did the right thing giving the bird back before it had time to bond. NTA", "NTA. First of all you don't do thins kind of thing against the parents' wishes.
