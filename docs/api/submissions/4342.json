I called CPS and talked to someone there but my sister remained with our parents and I was told there was no proof of anything negligent there. My sister asked to live with me repeatedly and then showed up at my door a few days ago and told me she needs me, that I'm basically her mom and I need to take care of her.

She will be getting more and more independent and soon, you will not have to be her mom anymore. She will in a year or two be much more of a sister then child to you. I feel like as much as your resentment and hate towards your parents is valid, you are taking it out on her, who is just as much of a victim as you are. Now she has no one to be there for her. And those wounds never fully heal.", "NTA. But if CPS doesn't step up - and they might not, because COS is chronically underfunded and ineffective - you need to consider whether you really feel okay about being yet another person to abandon your sister. It really, really sucks, and you're NTA if you do put yourself first. But you have an opportunity to break the cycle here. You could put clear boundaries in place, requiring that your sister be a lot more self-reliant than most 12 year olds are. Make it clear to her that if she screws up - doesn't pull her weight in terms of chores, fails to do all that's required at school, gets into substance abuse, whatever - she'll be going back to mom and dad.\n\nAnd then tap into all the resources that are available. Get both of you into counseling. Get yourself into some sort of career guidance program, so that your choices moving forward all work towards building you a rewarding and happy life. Find out what financial programs are available and tap into those. A social worker or someone at your old school should be able to advise you.\n\nYou don't have to be her mom, but you could still be her big sis and take the lead in setting BOTH of you free from the horrible start your parents gave you.", "NAH. You want to have a life where you can do what's best for you and that's fine. She wants to have someone give a shit about her, that's also fine. I know you don't have to OP, but try to spend time with her every now and then. You can start building a relationship and see each other as sisters instead of being in this weird dynamic your parents forced you into.", "I understand that you don\u2019t want to raise her and be responsible for her. I\u2019m sorry your parents suck:( The only thing is, you are a big part of your sisters life. She looks up to you. I know you don\u2019t want raise her, but I would still try to see her. Have her stay the night once a week and call or text her often. Let her know she can call you often.  I\u2019m sure it  really sucks for your sister too.", "This is heartbreaking. And i get where you are coming from. Raising her is not your job, yet you had to do it. I don't blame you for wanting your own life- you deserve it. But just keep in mind you are the only family she has and knows. And now you are just gone. It's not fair to her either. Do you have to help her? No. But maybe just guide her a little or talk to her still keep a relationship. Don't just dissappear off the face of the earth. Man your parents are horrible. I hope shit gets easier for you, and for her.", "This. OP, keep calling and making reports. Call again and let them know what happened with your sister. Go into more details about what happened to you. If you have ANY other family that might be able to pressure your parents into parenting, call them. But you do not need to act as a parent to this girl any longer, as sad as that is for her.", "Agreed NTA op but yea this broke my heart to read. You got screwed into being a parent as a child and don't want to be one anymore and I get that. And your younger sister is now alone floundering in uncertainty and not knowing where to look too since both yalls parents suck shit and you are wanting to do your own thing. I don't blame you in the least bit but fuck my heart breaks for little sister. Try to be there for her as much you possible can while also looking after your own mental health and well being", "They can't force OP to take her. That's not something  CPS is allowed to do.", "When the 12 year old was left to fend herself.", "That's not the relationship they have and that's not the relationship the younger sister wants, so OP will end up in the same position just in her place of safety, which will no longer then be her place of safety.", "All of you saying Y T A should band together to give OP all the money she needs to get custody, find a safe place to live, buy her a vehicle that is reliable to get to and from the work you all will surely find for her with flexible hours. \n\nIt isn\u2019t just that OP shouldn\u2019t have to help her sister. She *can\u2019t*.", ">You're not completely st fault,\n\nOP isn't even the teensiest fraction at fault.

I can't even imagine responding the way you did to this story, you should be ashamed of yourself", "She is not taking out on her.

It's sad for the sister but she did what she could", "How do you expect an 18yo to have the money to support her sister, to say nothing of getting custody and paying fees for that? Depending on where she lives OP could have gotten in legal trouble just letting a minor over which she has 0 custody stay overnight with her.  \n\nFeel free to offer OP all your money to do what you think she should do.", "Repeat after me: **Older siblings are not built-in caretakers.**", "Right, but sister could end up in the system and will be told that. So she needs to be prepared to refuse so she doesn't cave.", "if your sister comes back, record everything she says. take that tape to CPS as proof. obviously your \"parents\" have her terrified of what would happen if CPS actually knew what was going on, so show them if you can.", "NTA a million times over. \n\nThere isn\u2019t anything you can do for your sister if the state won\u2019t take her away. Even if the state does there is a good chance they won\u2019t place her with someone so young. CPS is a wildcard \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to say what they will or will not do. \n\nYou\u2019ve done what you can. I hope the rest of your life is joyous to make up for the shitty 18 years you spent in that house.", "Agreed. OP is still a kid herself. Yes, legal adult, but good great gravy how in the hell these Y T A commenters think it is even feasible for her to do this?", "\"But she is olderrr\" what a terrible AH to say such things to someone who was thorough that much in their brief life.", "I will agree with that. She needs to be prepared for them to try to guilt her into taking her sister.", "No she shouldn't be obligated at all to do sh*t. This woman lost her childhood to take care of her sister she won't lose her youth doing this.", "But she doesn't want and that's enough. Your take is wrong.", "It is? So when did the sibling get to decide to have a younger sibling...oh right, never. You are just as bad as OP's parents.", "This women is making her younger sister lose her childhood as well, if not worse, if the CPS take her away as a result. So yes she is obligated to be taking care of her younger sister. She is taking her bitterness for her parents out on to her younger sister and for that yes she is a A-hole.", "Doesn't really matter.

The OP herself understands this.", "No she has not. This doesn't exist. This is delusional.", "OP don't listen to this person her take is awful. She is victim blaming and putting a responsibility you don't have and shouldn't entertain on your shoulders they are the AHs just like your family.", "She doesn't want to do it and it's her right.

And you are just bullying an abused child...", "No one has a moral duty to people they didn't have you are delusional.", "You're being deliberately obtuse.", "Nope. She has a moral duty to be taking care of her younger sibling. It shouldn't even be a question about whether she should abandon her own younger sister or not.", "One of the rules here is accept the judgement not argue about someone elses and/or defend position. I've given my verdict. She is the AH for abandoning her younger sister. End off. I didn't ask for you opinion on my verdict.", "And I never tried to stop her. But she'd be a a-hole if she did. Simple. She asked. Not me. So yes, if she abandons her own younger sibling and wants to be selfish, then she can but she'd be a a-hole in my book.", "This person is not a child at 18 years old.

In either case if the parents failed to, then she should be taking care of her younger sister and giving her what she herself couldn't get. Not continuing the cycle by abandoning her own younger sibling. Sure, but abandoning your own younger sister and taking the bitterness you have for your parents into them is also self centred. Sure. Abandoning your younger sister is also abuse though. She shouldn't be following her parents footsteps and also abusing her younger sister by abandoning her. It is a siblings moral obligation to take care of their other sibling, whether younger, disabled or whatever if they have no where to go and they come calling to you, its a siblings moral responsibility and obligation, not doing that makes the OP a AH.", "No. But yes. It'd be their moral obligation. Taking care of their siblings doesn't mean they have to give up their childhood. That's a silly idea.\n\nIt is, it is their moral duty to take care of their younger siblings, doing what their parents couldn't/were unable to. They shouldn't be taking away from their younger siblings what they may not have had. Simple as that. The OP is 18, she can take care of her younger sister, and this shouldn't even be a question.

They can reach out to CPS.  Maybe another call from a mandated reporter will help.", "I called CPS on a situation, and nothing was done about it because the person was able to fake like she was a perfect parent and I spoke to cops about it when it resulted to cops being called and they told me that any time a child is endangered or abandoned, or being abused to call the cops before you call CPS because then when you call CPS you can say there\u2019s already a police log about it and that\u2019s evidence to CPS.", "NTA and even if it hurt go NC with her. I tell you because I have a similar experience (no the same, but it's for the context of feeling like you lose part of life for taking care of someone else).\n\nMy cousin since she was 15 has told that she didn't like to live with her mother. Fast forward, she came to live with my family (my mom, grandma, my stepdad, my uncle and my brothers). SURPRISE!! She was just a brat kid who wanted to skip school, date boys, take alcohol in the park, smoke pot, came home late and all my family feel so afraid it's something wrong happened, maybe she have and accident,etc. And, she only want to have fun. Me with 20 something years, took the role of parent, because a didn't want to distress my mom or my grandma. I have to deal with her attitude, teach her basic feminine hygiene,I make her repeat a year because she didn't learn anything and my punishment to her was to make the scholar year again because if she was old and mature enough to drink and smoke, she will be mature enough to think that with the grades she have, she wouldn't go to college. Fast forward 5 years, she became worse and her mom was like yours, no intention of make her a better person and teaching that she is a person who is capable of putting in risky situations for be a \"popular girl\". I kicked of my house, and speak with her mother \"your kid, your problem\".  I didn't lose my childhood and teen years like you, but I UNDERSTAND 100000% WHAT IS LIKE TO BE A PARENT FIGURE FOR SOMEONE WHO ISN'T YOUR CHILD.\n\nTo be encharge of someone who is a minor, who has to be taught and sometimes have to be punished, and teach how to an independent human for the society it's so difficult, and it's worse if it's not your child.\n\nI hope for the best results with your problems, and that your sister understand that she isn't the culprit but for her you lose your entire life.

Her sister's situation is awful but her sister at least doesn't have to take care of anyone else.", "Emotionally she would have to play mom. There are absolutely no normal boundaries in place in this 'sister' relationship. She should not ever have had to be her mom in the first place - it's abuse and she shouldn't stay in it. You can't heal when you stay within an abusive situation. She's not taking it out on her, she's trying to set a boundary. Until her sister can accept the boundary that she emotionally, physically, financially is not her parent, she will continue to cross it and keep emotionally (unintentionally) adding to OP's trauma. Those boundaries need time to build for OP to have a healthy future. Even perhaps for them to be able to have a healthy relationship at all.", "I would advise no overnights. That will be abused by the shitty parents immediately", "Call her school and speak to her councilor. Is there a boys and girls club nearby? A YMCA?

You know what happens in situations like this...the younger child ends up with the wrong crowd doing drugs or getting in so much trouble, pregnant at a young age from any guy guy who shows her an ounce of attention that she is so desperately craving. It isn't OPs responsibility to parent her sister and I get it, she's done and run. But she didn't run far enough if her sister found her. If OP truly wants nothing to do with any of them, she needs to run further away or she'll be constantly seeing little sis begging for her", "She was taking care of a newborn at 6. Six. Years. Old. \n\nDo you sincerely think a person with that kind of childhood doesn't have some mental/emotional issues of their own that will likely preclude them from being able to nurture a preteen/teenager?", "And she'd be giving her own younger sister a lot more mental/emotional issues by not taking care of her and abandoning her. Imagine being rejected by her older sister, the same sister that had been taking care of her, when she has no where else to go. Even worse if CPS ended up rehousing her and OP still let it happen.", "That's such a tired, lame argument. By posting your judgement you invited people to give an opinion. But you have no strong argument so you fall back on the childish \"no one asked you\" grade school comeback.", "Last I checked it was the OP asking for the opinions. Not me. Either way, where's your argument? The OP is knowingly putting her younger sister through the wringer because she's selfish, that alone is enough criteria to be a AH in my book."]}
