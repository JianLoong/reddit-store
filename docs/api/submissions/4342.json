I called CPS and talked to someone there but my sister remained with our parents and I was told there was no proof of anything negligent there.

You are her sister and you love her. If you want what is best for her, Make school administrators aware of the situation. School nurses also. The more people advocating for her the more likely she will get away from your parents while allowing you the chance at a life with a SISTER.\n\n\nGood luck in the next stages of you growth!", "NTA\nBut you need therapy because you're directing a lot of this anger and resentment at a child who has done nothing wrong. These emotions should be aimed at your parents. You don't have to be your sister's mum but I hope for both your sakes that you are still offering emotional and mental support. You may end up only having each other as you get older.", "NTA.  If your sister comes back, ask her if there are things they are or aren\u2019t doing that you can report to CPS.  If they leave her alone overnight, don\u2019t feed her enough, are t getting her proper clothing for the weather or having her kids school.  Tell her the most you can help us report them when they do these things, but you need to know at the time so the cops can come and find her there alone or without food, etc.", "NTA ... such a sad story and to ppl who saying call CPS , they brly get involved unless is something like rape/physical abuse/starvation then good luck ... they are so understaffed and no budget that as long as the kid has a roof, has food and no physical abuse then its a win for them ... Ive heard something crazy like one case worker has like 300-400 cases ... that is insane, thy shouldn't have more then 50.", "Yeah this is a NAH. That poor girl. Wow", "Correct judgment would be NAH", "Everything about this situation breaks my heart and the sister is obviously not an AH. Glad someone else noticed.", "OP\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t WANT a sister, she wants a mom. It\u2019ll be extremely hard to even get to the point of sisters when the other sister doesn\u2019t want it in the first place.", "> I know you don't have to OP, but\n\nPro-tip: Every time you start a sentence with this *stop* and reconsider what you're saying. You're qualifying it; you know you're about to say something unreasonable and possibly harmful. \n\n>LOL downvoted for not calling an abandoned child an asshole and suggesting kindness.\n\nNo you're being downvoted for telling OP to do something she's made very plain she doesn't want to do. That's not kindness.", "OP: I want nothing to do with this person.\n\nYou: Okay but you should babysit her once a week, talk to her all the time and basically just be her parent anyway!", "literally how do you expect her to treat her? Pretend that they\u2019re mother and daughter?", "If there's a pediatrician, get in contact with them too, ASAP, and report.", "That\u2019s the point of calling\u2014to get her into the system.", "You\u2019re either trolling or incredibly ignorant. No, siblings do not have a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to take care of their younger siblings (aka parent them and take all responsibility over them). That would never have to happen if the ACTUAL parents decided to ya know PARENT. You don\u2019t have children so that they can then take care of the children you decided to give birth to afterwards. This is parentification and it IS abuse.", "NTA but OP, I was in your position. My sister was in a slightly altered position (we had different dads, her dad was an asshole and stepmom wasn\u2019t really great). She lived with them, I lived with our neglectful and alcoholic mom, but at the *bare minimum* I texted her periodically and followed her on SM to make sure she was safe. She wasn\u2019t being neglected, physically hurt, but her dad wasn\u2019t the nicest person. \n\nYou are by no means obligated to take care of her and that should\u2019ve never been your responsibility. There is a middle ground and I know you were thrown to an extreme. It\u2019s easy to think to the next extreme when it was all you knew. \n\nYou\u2019re doing great by focusing on your safety and mental health, this is so important for you. Boundaries are important and I can imagine it was hard to say that to your sister when she arrived. I just\u2026I don\u2019t know how I feel about doing nothing if she came to me begging for help. Granted I don\u2019t know your sister\u2019s personality or the intricate details, but at the very least you can at least call CPS once or twice more, you can call her school and let them in the loop too. \n\nAgain, I know it\u2019s not your responsibility and should never have been, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re having her move in again, she literally has NO ONE, she can\u2019t move out on her own, and these phone calls shouldn\u2019t take any more than a few hours. I\u2019m so sorry that you and your sister have had to go through this. I would really take the time to think over your options. I\u2019m proud of you for taking the first steps and just know it\u2019ll get better.", "Absolutely NTA. You deserve your own life.", "Life is hard and taking care of her would be extremely difficult in your situation. But do it anyway. You will always have each other. You will look back on abandoning her with regret.", "NTA. Your parents are huge AHs for not even being parents for either of you. Your sister doesn\u2019t know any better. However you\u2019re not responsible for her.", "And to be honest, negligence is one of the most screened out reports you can make. Because of CPS's extremely messed up history in the US where they used to take too many kids, mainly Black & Native kids, the pendulum is the other direction right now and it's extremely hard to clear the bar of proof for CPS to take action, and even taking action often means \"monthly check-ins\" or \"family therapy,\" not removal of kids.\n\nThe bar is so high that the kids I've met in my work in education that have been removed were all in situations that were hard to even imagine, in the child molestation or attempted murder range (and even that doesn't remotely guarantee removal). Your suggestion of seeking trusted help is a good one, ranging from school staff to community organizations & members.", "> who is just as much of a victim as you are.\n\nIf she's \"just as much a victim as OP\" then why is OP the one who has to suffer? Why are we not concerned about OP healing? Why do you seem to legit think that OP is responsible for raising this kid now?", "> Can I suggest that your home be open to her, *as a sister*?\n\nOP: I want nothing to do with this person.\n\nYou: Okay but you really should just be raising her anyway.", "> then you should be responsible for taking care of her either way.\n\nThis is just you confessing that you're too lazy to raise your own kids, right? So whose doing it?", "My thoughts as well.", "Maybe have your sister call CPS herself and see what happens.", "> on that basis the OP should be obligated to taking care of her sister\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart I want to sincerely thank you for talking shit like this. Its not very often that people lay the crazy of DNA Fetishism out so plainly for rational people to read and decide against.", "> She's not escaping a abusive situation by abandoning her helpless younger sister and ruining her life \n\nGetting herself into a situation where she no longer has to parent her sister is the *exact method* of escaping her abuse because--and read this slowly til you get it--her having to raise her sister was the abuse. You're sitting here claiming that OP has a moral duty to *be abused more.*", "> It is a siblings job.\n\nNo, that's *the parents' job.* OP didn't decide to have children. When you decide to have children you take on the job of raising them.", "> It's the siblings moral duty\n\nAccording to what morality set?", "You're dodging the question because you can't answer it.", "OP, don\u2019t give up and keep calling CPS. I\u2019ve called CPS, my aunt has called them for me, but it wasn\u2019t until my teacher and school counselor called them that they actually took me serious. You\u2019re not your sister\u2019s mother, and you do not owe her anything. But I think asking your old teachers or your sister\u2019s current teachers to call CPS to get her out of the situation you had to live in would be nice. \n\nNTA btw", "NTA. I read these horror stories and it makes me extra careful with my own children as they have an 11yr gap. While I appreciate the insight into parentification, I feel so terrible for those of you who have to go through this. You were failed by so many adults. While it sucks for your sister, you did what you could and you deserve your own life.", "NTA Would you feel better if you took her out for a weekly girls\u2019 afternoon tea? I do that with my sister. It\u2019s a bestie sister thing and not a Mum thing.", "NAH\n\nYour sister has a desiderata need,  but it is not your responsibility to fill that gap \n\n(Actually your parents and the CPS are assholes, but this is about an issue between you and your sister,  and neither of you are assholes)", "NTA but going cold turkey with your sister is going to be problematic. She depended on you so much, you are the only RESPONSIBLE adult she knows. I don\u2019t think you should cut her off but slowly ease her away where she visits once or twice a week/month.  You should NOT take care of her but reformat your relationship to little sis/big sis. Just a thought.", "NTA. Write up everything you recall about how you were treated and what you were expected to do for your sister with as many dates or approximate dates as possible. Ask neighbors, extended family, friends, teachers, doctors and anyone else you can think of to provide witness statements. Ask friends if they remember coming over and seeing how you were treated and write down what they tell you. If CPS won't help, see if there's a state agency or non-profit that will help. Talk to your sister's teachers and school officials because they are mandated reporters. Use the words that trigger mandated reporting and CPS action like abandonment, neglect, psychological abuse. Also write down the names of everyone who knew exactly what was going on and refused to help or collaborated with your parents. Speak to an attorney to see if there are any legal remedies for you or your sister. Tell your sister that you can't be her mother but you are working hard to get her a better living situation and the help she needs. Explain to her that you are just as much a victim in this situation as she is and therefore not qualified to parent her since like her, you need to get help for the trauma you've suffered. Make sure you start seeing a mental health therapist asap."]}
