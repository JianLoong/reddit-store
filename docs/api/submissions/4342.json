They left us alone a lot. They made me take care of her and would sometimes sit there and tell me what to do with her. If she cried I was called and my dad's parents were around and knew but did fuck all to help us.

I started to teach my sister how to take care of herself a year later. So she was 5. I had to teach her to make sandwiches and how to get a drink for herself. I also had her get herself to bed by that age. My parents only got worse leaving us alone for longer stretches of time. I hated it. I resented every second of having to be a parent to my sister and when I turned 18 a couple of months ago I ran like my ass was on fire. I called CPS and talked to someone there but my sister remained with our parents and I was told there was no proof of anything negligent there. My sister asked to live with me repeatedly and then showed up at my door a few days ago and told me she needs me, that I'm basically her mom and I need to take care of her. I told her I'm not her mom and I need my own life. She told me she has nobody else. I told her I didn't either and that I did my best to teach her the stuff I had to learn on my own.

She ended up storming back to our parents house. She then came over the day after and told me I was mean and should do whatever it takes for her because I'm older. She also said I was so mean for saying I'm not her mom when I'm all she knows.\n\nI know I am older, I know this is hard for her, but I also know I have no desire to keep doing this.

So yes, I would expect the sibling to not ruin their siblings life by being self centred and bitter and taking that bitterness for their parents out onto the younger sibling.\n\nNot really.\n\nNo ones denying the parents being terrible. But that doesn't mean the older sibling also forsakes their younger sibling. It's a moral obligation.\n\nSure, but so is the OP for being so self centred and not taking care of her own younger sister, even when she came calling with no where else to go. The OP is also a abuser and continuing the cycle by abusing and abandoning her younger sister."]}
