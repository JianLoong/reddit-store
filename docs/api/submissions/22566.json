My fianc\u00e9s sister got engaged two weeks ago (before us). We are Italian and have deep roots in Italy. So we have always wanted a wedding in Italy. My fianc\u00e9s sister is having her wedding in North Carolina (where we are all from). \n\nNow we made it \"lightly\" known that March of 2025 was the best time for our wedding in Italy. The venues are significantly cheaper and it is significantly cheaper for our guests (hotels, cars, flights, etc). Basically it is 40% cheaper for us and our guests based on our research. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9s sister went ahead and booked her wedding venue in NC for early June 2025. We said \"That's awesome, we are looking at late march for our wedding\". \n\nAnd here is where the conflict is. My fianc\u00e9s sister says that is too close to her wedding. Only November of 2025 would be appropriate. We then asked her to check with her venue to see if late June is a option for her. She said it would be an extra $500 dollars to move the date to late June. We offered to pay it, she refused. \n\nHer family is also saying that a wedding in March 2025 (in Italy) is \"too much\" if guests would also have to travel to NC in June. This doesn't make sense because November is fine, but March is not. Because (in my view), her sister has convinced the family that because she got engaged first, she gets to dictate everything. And she 100% does not want us getting married before her. \n\nSo I'm trying to reconcile with the fact that her sister chose the end of a season (spring) and basically says she needs a 4 month buffer on either side until we can get married. Her family, who was previously very supportive of Italy in March, is now saying its \"too much\" for weddings 10 weeks apart. They said people won't have \"budget to travel in March\" but November they do? And to be clear, I'm paying for 90% of the wedding. Yet her family is dictating everything. I also can't push back, because it puts my fianc\u00e9 in a difficult situation. My fianc\u00e9 is trying to push back but again, this is her family... its not easy. \n\nLong story short - AITA for saying to my fianc\u00e9 that her sister/family do not get to own multiple seasons for her sisters wedding?

Yes destination weddings are expensive and not a luxury that everyone can afford. If you\u2019re choosing to do a destination wedding you need to be flexible in making it work for the guests, otherwise why have one in the first place?
