My fianc\u00e9s sister got engaged two weeks ago (before us). We are Italian and have deep roots in Italy. So we have always wanted a wedding in Italy. My fianc\u00e9s sister is having her wedding in North Carolina (where we are all from). \n\nNow we made it \"lightly\" known that March of 2025 was the best time for our wedding in Italy. The venues are significantly cheaper and it is significantly cheaper for our guests (hotels, cars, flights, etc). Basically it is 40% cheaper for us and our guests based on our research. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9s sister went ahead and booked her wedding venue in NC for early June 2025. We said \"That's awesome, we are looking at late march for our wedding\". \n\nAnd here is where the conflict is. My fianc\u00e9s sister says that is too close to her wedding. Only November of 2025 would be appropriate. We then asked her to check with her venue to see if late June is a option for her. She said it would be an extra $500 dollars to move the date to late June. We offered to pay it, she refused. \n\nHer family is also saying that a wedding in March 2025 (in Italy) is \"too much\" if guests would also have to travel to NC in June. This doesn't make sense because November is fine, but March is not. Because (in my view), her sister has convinced the family that because she got engaged first, she gets to dictate everything. And she 100% does not want us getting married before her. \n\nSo I'm trying to reconcile with the fact that her sister chose the end of a season (spring) and basically says she needs a 4 month buffer on either side until we can get married. Her family, who was previously very supportive of Italy in March, is now saying its \"too much\" for weddings 10 weeks apart. They said people won't have \"budget to travel in March\" but November they do? And to be clear, I'm paying for 90% of the wedding. Yet her family is dictating everything. I also can't push back, because it puts my fianc\u00e9 in a difficult situation. My fianc\u00e9 is trying to push back but again, this is her family... its not easy. \n\nLong story short - AITA for saying to my fianc\u00e9 that her sister/family do not get to own multiple seasons for her sisters wedding?

Yes destination weddings are expensive and not a luxury that everyone can afford. If you\u2019re choosing to do a destination wedding you need to be flexible in making it work for the guests, otherwise why have one in the first place?

For what it's worth, I also find the European weather more pleasant in autumn in than in spring.", "Genuine question- why do people get mocked for saying they are Irish American or Italian American, but not for saying African American? In each case it might be same number of generations ago that their ancestors came to America. \n(I\u2019m British, so it\u2019s all a bit new to me)", "Genuine question- why do people get mocked for saying they are Irish American or Italian American, but not for saying African American?

Italian by delusion", "It also gives people a break since there is obviously overlap between the two grooms guest lists, just as the two brides in OPs situation. We\u2019re going to both and leaving our kids, shelling out a ton for childcare, tickets, hotels, husband taking time from work, buying two dresses for me, etc. and it\u2019s nice that it\u2019s not two in a row close\u2014we have other obligations, which this guy seems to forget. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around your family OP, some people have other shit going on in that time period too! We have a black tie benefit right between those weddings, a 40th birthday that\u2019s out of town, and oh I should be popping out a kid lol. He seems so self involved to me!", "I am not black and don't have the best understanding of black culture in America but I think it might be because African Americans are trying to reclaim a culture that was stolen from them through slavery. For decades, their personhood was suppressed down into \"the slave who belongs to Mr. So and So\" or \"the maid of Mrs. ABC\" but in the last 50-60 years (or perhaps earlier), they have had the freedom to embrace and celebrate what it means to be black, the ability to learn more about where they were stolen from, and not be lambasted or brought down for it. It's a reclamation process. Someone please fill in the gaps or tell me if I've gone wrong somewhere.", "When they're getting mocked of its usually because they're using it in a way to defend how oppressed they are, or to make themselves more of a minority or more unique rather than just being white. It's also frequently used in defense of being racist. \"I can't be racist, I'm ITALIAN-AMERICAN\" type thing. It's not the identification itself that's being mocked, but usually the way it's being used.", "Africa is a continent and not a single country would be the most general reason. So it\u2019s describing a broad group of ancestry that supersedes any specify nationality.\n\nAlso, there is a bit of contention for some regarding people whose family have been in the U.S. for multiple generations claiming other nationalities even as a secondary descriptor, when they have no actual current ties to the country or contemporary culture.\n\nIn other words, there is a significant objective difference between and Irish American and an Irishman, and some people view using the self-identification as offensively conflating the two. So you\u2019ll see people saying, \u201cno I am an Irish American, because I was born and raised in Ireland and moved to America. You\u2019re just an American of partial Irish decent.\u201d To me, it can be valid or gatekeeping, depending on the context, but others view it as a hard dichotomy.", "...What\u2019s wrong with just being American? Having Italian family of +100 years ago does not make you Italian. You probably don\u2019t even speak the language, much less ever having been there at all.", "Well, typically if you\u2019re not born somewhere you\u2019re not that nationality. \n\nMy little ancestry DNA has me listed as 100% from one country \u2026 but I was born in america. I\u2019m American.", "Actually italy is a country that grants citizenship by birth through the paternal line, for as many generations as you can go back, or maternal for those born after 1948. So as long as you have the record to back it up (and have the patience to deal with italian bureaucracy!) You could get italian citizenship even if your last ancestor born in the country was over 100 years ago. Italian is in the blood.", "Can I downvote you twice? \nJust once isn't enough for the amount of brain cells I lost reading your comment.", "It\u2019s also kind of shady that OP is trying to get their guests to commit to attend their wedding in March when they haven\u2019t booked anything yet. Why push so hard to get people on board with a hypothetical date? The couple picks the date and the guests decide whether or not they want to come. That\u2019s how it has always worked. It sounds like they wanted their wedding to be prioritized over the SIL\u2019s and their plan is backfiring.", "It's also because they act like the bastions of all Italian knowledge and culture and then get upset and defensive when a real Italian chimes in and says \"actually, we don't do that\" or \"we don't say it like that\"", "Exactly. I'm a first gen immigrant. Both my parents immigrated to the US from their respective countries and then had me. I've been to both of their home countries and even got a degree in one of them yet I knew I was a foreigner there and everyone around me could see that I was clearly American, not in a bad way but in the way I walked and talked and my values. For example, Americans really value their independence more than other countries. In other countries, if your business fails you have failed yet in America, your business has failed but you can try again. That's a very specific mentality that comes through growing up in a specific place and interacting with specific people. It is laughable to assume that your ancestors who immigrated 100+ years ago, thus severing ties, have anything in common with Italians of today. There was even an example of someone who spoke fluent Danish because the language had been passed down through his ancestors returning to Cophenhagen but everyone thought he was speaking like an old man.", "Probably because others aren\u2019t labeled as just American. I\u2019ve never been called just an American here and I\u2019m indigenous to this continent. People like to feel connected to their heritage because America\u2019s version of assimilation is white washing. NTA OP.", "Because America has had a very very long history of demanding assimilation. Anything that can\u2019t be, is vilified and hated. \n\nItalians faced all kinds of hardships. One of the largest mass lynchings was that of 11 Italians. One of the people responsible? Became the Governor. \n\nAnyways. \n\nPeople when coming to America would do one of two things. Either they held onto their heritage and culture or they buried it as much as possible. People would go as far as changing names to fit in better and be as white as possible. \n\nA few hundred years of this kind of stuff, does a real number on people and the concepts of heritage and culture. \n\nSome pass it down in defiance of a world where a future President, Teddy Roosevelt, can be quoted as saying the lynching of 11 Italians was \u201ca rather good thing.\u201d And it all kinda gets warped that way. \n\nThen there are those who eventually dig into their family lineage and decide to unbury that and\u2026 well it gets kinda wonky as a result. \n\nWhen it comes to these things, America is seriously and truly fucked from centuries of this stuff that absolutely continues to this day.", "i think you\u2019re getting nationality and ethnicity confused", "That\u2019s fascinating I had no idea they did that"]}
