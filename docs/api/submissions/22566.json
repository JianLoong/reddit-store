My fianc\u00e9s sister got engaged two weeks ago (before us). We are Italian and have deep roots in Italy. So we have always wanted a wedding in Italy. My fianc\u00e9s sister is having her wedding in North Carolina (where we are all from). \n\nNow we made it \"lightly\" known that March of 2025 was the best time for our wedding in Italy. The venues are significantly cheaper and it is significantly cheaper for our guests (hotels, cars, flights, etc). Basically it is 40% cheaper for us and our guests based on our research. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9s sister went ahead and booked her wedding venue in NC for early June 2025. We said \"That's awesome, we are looking at late march for our wedding\". \n\nAnd here is where the conflict is. My fianc\u00e9s sister says that is too close to her wedding. Only November of 2025 would be appropriate. We then asked her to check with her venue to see if late June is a option for her. She said it would be an extra $500 dollars to move the date to late June. We offered to pay it, she refused. \n\nHer family is also saying that a wedding in March 2025 (in Italy) is \"too much\" if guests would also have to travel to NC in June. This doesn't make sense because November is fine, but March is not. Because (in my view), her sister has convinced the family that because she got engaged first, she gets to dictate everything. And she 100% does not want us getting married before her. \n\nSo I'm trying to reconcile with the fact that her sister chose the end of a season (spring) and basically says she needs a 4 month buffer on either side until we can get married. Her family, who was previously very supportive of Italy in March, is now saying its \"too much\" for weddings 10 weeks apart. They said people won't have \"budget to travel in March\" but November they do? And to be clear, I'm paying for 90% of the wedding. Yet her family is dictating everything. I also can't push back, because it puts my fianc\u00e9 in a difficult situation. My fianc\u00e9 is trying to push back but again, this is her family... its not easy. \n\nLong story short - AITA for saying to my fianc\u00e9 that her sister/family do not get to own multiple seasons for her sisters wedding?

Yes destination weddings are expensive and not a luxury that everyone can afford. If you\u2019re choosing to do a destination wedding you need to be flexible in making it work for the guests, otherwise why have one in the first place?

But we are paying and planning the wedding.", "But youre saying she only cares about getting married first but she originally booked a date *AFTER* yours. \n\nI think youre searching for conflict here because youre pissed people are picking her wedding over yours\u2026", "This kind of is a business transaction because you\u2019re asking people to spend time and money to attend your wedding. There\u2019s nothing to compromise here. They told you that if you get married in March, they probably won\u2019t come because now that your SIL is getting married in June. Now you have a choice to make: either have the wedding in March and accept that some of your close family won\u2019t be there or have it later in the year.", "Well it kind of is for your guests - they have to spend a lot of money on these weddings. I know its your special day but its a several thousand dollar price tag for them.", "Compromise isn't actually required. Your wedding is inconvenient and super expensive. Her's is less so. They need the time to build the money back. \n\nAlso, you don't normally propose within 2 weeks of a close family member which is probably why the family is siding with her.", "Consider both couples listing out every single event related to the wedding and plotting out the dates within that 3 mo timeline, the lead up into the aerier one and then the lead up into the next one, including any possible deadlines for when hotel or travel deposits will be needed. And some guests may not have passports so event cost/timeline for those.\n\nThose data points may give some perspective for everyone invovlved - either showing it\u2019s a lot or proving it isn\u2019t.\n\nGood luck!", "Because the family said \"people wont come\". Insinuating that they talked to people. But they won't share who.\n\nWe care because we at least want the support of her parents. Previously we had it and now we don't. Naturally we want to understand \"why\" - which I've given my biased opinion.", "Totally understandable. Having all that support just soured in a short amount of time is definitely frustrating. Again, weddings being out the worst of people! I hope you all can enjoy your families and moments. The drama will be over and may all the relationships still be intact after.\n\nBut if inconvenience is the worst of it all, that\u2019s honestly something easily forgiven and forgotten when this is all over! Set a different date, and focus back on you and your fianc\u00e9 celebrating good times together. Italy is going to be a blast.", "You are reaching now. We have our minimum number for the destination wedding. \n\nWe never booked a venue, we only said early Spring is best for us. So she booked and then basically said Spring of 2025 is off limits. She has verbally told us that she wants this buffer.", "Between family planning the wedding, its not a business transaction. Families need to compromise and work together especially with weddings. They basically said \"people on our side won't come\". But they won't share who. We know exactly who is coming (we reached out to everyone). So in my mind, its just a excuse because their other daughter is upset about a wedding before her.", "Yes for our guests... but I'm talking about between direct family planning the wedding. We know who is coming. If you can't come, no hard feelings at all. Its expensive, we know that.", "Our wedding is inconvenient. Which is why we previously got a minimum number (people are excited to go) and support from family. But now the family has changed their mind. \n\nThe second comment is irrelevant. You don't know the details of it.", "Her parents didn\u2019t know that your SIL was getting married in June and now that they do, they are no longer on board for a March wedding. They\u2019re allowed to change their mind for any reason they want. Your wedding date isn\u2019t set and your SIlL\u2019s is. I believe that people should be able to get married whenever and however they want but they don\u2019t have a right to be upset if some of their loved ones decide not want to be involved. If you want to know which family members are willing to come, call each of them and ask.", "I agree - thanks for the input. Have a great week.", "Yeah, I agree that it sounds like your future SIL just wants to get married first; you've said that you and your partner don't want to damage relationships with her family further, but if you wanted to put your foot down you could always do the 'two wedding' approach, and do a small wedding in the here-and-now style for her family to attend, and a larger destination event (whether a full wedding or just a celebration) in Italy on your initial planned date", "\u201cTravel to Italy\u201d isnt a compromise. \n\nIt really does come across like some people dont want to/cant go and youre trying to blame your FSIL for it.", "Don\u2019t minimize the financial burden you\u2019re putting on your guests. Personally I don\u2019t know where people get the nerve to ask their loved ones to spend so much money on their wedding but that\u2019s beside the point. If you want to know which of your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family members are coming, pick up the phone and ask. You don\u2019t need that information relayed to you. When you have a destination wedding, you have to be prepared for some of the important people in your life not to attend and that includes parents and siblings.", "This is a great idea. One I haven't thought of. Thanks for the input.", "You are intentionally ignoring key parts. I said we already have our minimum number. We know who is coming. Thats not the issue. \n\nIts the competition of getting married first and this buffer zone. You've made your judgement, thanks for the input.", ">Don\u2019t minimize the financial burden you\u2019re putting on your guests.

It's tough to have an international wedding location, talking from experience. You'll have people pull out for all sorts of bs reasons. If the family does really want to be at both weddings then I understand the ask for compromise. Any reason you can't delay the wedding for a year? This will probably be a once in a lifetime trip for many people, that will create a huge emotional link for the wedding and will always be remembered. But if you're not worried about the people who can't make it just do what you want and enjoy your day!", "It is on you because the news of your SIL\u2019s wedding date might have changed things for people. Your guests haven\u2019t accepted anything. You can\u2019t accept a hypothetical invitation. As the hosts, you have a responsibility to assess the burden you\u2019re placing on your guests and making sure that burden is ok with them. The burden has changed since you last spoke to them about this so it\u2019s time for another check in.", "Or Spring of 2024 that\u2019s  a15 month gap !"]}
