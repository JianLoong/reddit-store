We both work full time, jobs that we enjoy but are demanding.  We coach sports, and have busy social lives.  We enjoy and protect our family time when we have it.\n\nMy SIL (32) and her BF (late 20's) move around often for work.  They come home for weeks at a time-- on their schedule-- and expect the red carpet.  They expect airport rides, borrow people's cars rather than rent and have never spent one night in a hotel-- on their on volition, not because people are begging them to stay with them.\n\nIn our area they have three different places they can stay (not to mention the numerous friends that they have imposed on in the past):  Place A is a home my SIL lived in for more than three months two years ago, is available, but the boyfriend finds it too musty.  Place B is her parents home, but she does not get along with BIL (37) so she doesn't like that, and place C doesn't get a look for some reason.\n\nHistory:  Wife and SIL get along okay, but are different people.  Conflicts in the past, including one that relates to the situation here: SIL had an apartment lease expiring 3 months before traveling for a job.  Despite having all the places mentioned above to stay, she was angry she was not invited to live with us for the 3 month period.  Never acknowledged how unfair her expectation was, and still stands behind her feelings.\n\nThey are poor house guests, acknowledged by wife.  They stayed last year, went to dinner the first night and neithter of them moved for the check--  just let it sit for a while until I picked it up.  Went for dessert after and said thanks before ringing out, obviously we covered that too.  Next morning awoke expecting breakfast-- no offer to run out for bagels, or even cook my food for us.\n\nTheir history is to linger unendingly, even when not staying over, which we tried to prepare for.  We organized this knowing they had plans with a hard exit the next day- we found out the next morning they fell through.  My wife hinted with \"what are your plans today...\" and they said \"nothing\".\n\nLunch time came around, my wife asked again \"nothing planned for the rest of the day?\" \"Nope!\"  We ordered and they just gave their choices, no offer to even split it.\n\nIn order to get them to leave, my wife had to lie about an event we were attending- I don't approve, but its their family culture- and they stayed until the moment we had to leave, walking us to the car!  Got the kids dressed, got in the car and drove away just to shake them.\n\nThis is they way the operate, not a one off.\n\nI asked my wife permissionion discuss this with them before inviting them to stay at my home. Its a hard \"no\" due to the family culture.  I don't agree, but its not worth the months long (years long?) stress with my wife if I pull the trigger.\n\nMy position is they are not allowed to stay when they visit until there is a conversation.  She refuses the conversation, and is furious at me for not letting them stay over.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703862173, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tp2oa/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_and_her_bf_sleep_at/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is okay with her sister walking all over your hospitality until you have to play tricks like a circus to get them to leave. \n\nDie on this hill my good man. This is beyond ridiculous. They can rent a hotel and learn to adult already. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It's better for your wife to be furious with you than for all of the family to have to tolerate such rude behavior.", "NTA. \n\n3 months with these people? No thanks. \n\nWith your wife, there are only a few ways forward, one of which you already proposed. Talk to your wife and lay them out.\n\n1. She talks to them about their behavior and they agree to change, then you do a test run and see if it works. She said no to this, so you can propose it again, but doubt it will change. I'd still suggest it again as one of these options. \n2. Tell her to handle them if they come to visit, but make it clear she will be doing it alone. This means they borrow her car, you will be doing stuff with the kids/your own stuff and won't be dragged in to their social life, you won't be helping drive them around, etc. And you won't be paying a cent for them. If you have fully shared finances, this last part may not work, but if you have separate finances or shared but you each have a separate savings/fun money, then tell her to use that for them. Basically, they are fully her problem. \n3. Agree to just not host them. You two disagree on having them as guests, and to me, in a shared home, one \"no\" is all it takes. You have offered a middle ground, your wife doesn't want to do anything to make the visits less stressful, so she has to accept that they can't stay in your shared home. She is welcome to propose other solutions as well, but she can't acknowledge how problematic they are, not want to address it, and want you to open your home and wallet to them.", "NTA, OP. I think the core issue is that they are such poor house guests. They overstay, take advantage of your generosity and money, and laze around with no clear departure times or breaks. It is ok to tell your wife that they cannot stay again unless they behave differently. Can that be achieved without a discussion? I doubt it. Would a conversation fix it? I don\u2019t know. It may make things impossibly awkward and uncomfortable later. I imagine your wife is trying to avoid family drama and tension, that could last for years and years. The solution may be to not offer them a place to stay over, but to offer them dinner and take them out where you can decide when the night is over."]}
