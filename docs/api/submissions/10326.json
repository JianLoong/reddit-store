I refer to myself as \"cis by default,\" because I just don't care enough to bother correcting people, though I'm probably closer to non-binary in that none of it matters to me, no matter to which direction. I use either she/her or they/them pronouns equally comfortably. (I'd probably also be comfortable with he/him if anybody ever used it, but I've got the kind of chest that doesn't lead anyone to make that assumption.) \n\nBut my husband knows all that. It was never difficult to talk to him about, and even though it was never very emotionally significant to me as a topic, it was significant to me that we were able to share whatever came up.

That does not read to me like a good, close, emotionally intimate relationship. And it apparently doesn't read like one to your fiance\u00e9 either, which I suspect is a great deal of why she's so upset by this: it feels as if you chose to draw very far back from her, and that worries her considerably about what it might mean for your marriage.", "I'm not saying it isn't, or that it's the OP's fault! I'm saying that if she's not somebody who's comfortable for him to talk openly with, then she's probably not the right person to marry, and the marriage will probably not be a happy one for him. \n\nMy efforts haven't been directed at encouraging OP to talk to his fiance\u00e9 whether or not it's comfortable for him to do so. They've been directed at encouraging him to reconsider whether this is the right partner for him, if it's *not* comfortable to talk to her. If she's stuck in a rigid way of thinking and not open-minded, she wouldn't be a good fit for me, certainly, and that might make her not a good fit for OP either.", "As someone who enjoys a much lower level of humiliation in the right environment it reads like a humiliation kink a lot.", "Por que no los dos?", "But his fiance asked if he's struggling with his identity and he said yes.

But from my interpretation of this situation, you are excited by the *humiliation* that being referred to as a woman brings you. Being a woman is not humiliating or shameful. It is humiliating to you because you're a man. Your wife has shown that she is open minded and accepting of a different gender identity, but you say she's not open minded. Are you afraid she won't be open minded to your secret kink? \n\nNot caring about your gender is a very good indicator that you're cis. Being uncomfortable in your body because of sex characteristics would be reason to question your gender identity. You can be cis and have a non-conventional gender *expression*, but that is different from being trans. Having a humiliation kink is not related to gender identity, even if it involves crossdressing. The reason it is humiliating is because it feels wrong, if it feels wrong to be called a woman, you're probably a man. \n\nWeirdly enough, I recommend you go check out some humiliation or sissy kink stuff and see if it tickles your fancy. It might clear this up for you and give you some clarity.", "So you see, this is a confusing topic (as in, one that\u2019s difficult for me to explain)\u2026 and one that\u2019s not really related to the post. So\u2026 bear with me while I try to navigate this and sorry if it\u2019s not completely coherent or disregard this completely because it\u2019s not totally relevant. \n\nI actually don\u2019t think I\u2019m really into humiliation. Everything online is so brutal and over-exaggerated and not at all like what I\u2019m looking for. It\u2019s not a secret, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even a kink of mine. \n\nI don\u2019t find being a woman to be a shameful thing. I also don\u2019t find myself being androgynous to be a shameful thing. If I was ever mistaken for a woman or called ma\u2019am/miss/she or her while out by someone else, it wouldn\u2019t bother, humiliate, or arouse me. I\u2019m a human, all the other stuff comes secondary. (I also don\u2019t think I\u2019m trans, but I don\u2019t think my gender identity fully falls under the cis label either! I\u2019m still figuring that one out but am in no rush to do so.)\n\nThe way I feel when he calls me these names is more\u2026 pleasantly embarrassed. And I think it\u2019s all in the way he says it. It\u2019s half teasing but fully affectionate and loving. I don\u2019t think these are words meant to make me mortified any more than a new partner calling you \u2018baby\u2019 in front of his parents when you meet them for the first time would be. They\u2019re meant to be playful, but certainly not degrading. Pleasantly embarrassing is the most accurate way I can think to describe it. Pleased but\u2026 exposed, I guess? Haha.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s kind of like an inside joke but more intimate. That\u2019s another way to describe it, I suppose.

It's unfair to her to keep this secret. Regardless, I really don't think this is related to gender identity at all and it seems like you don't either, so don't hide behind that. Have the difficult conversation that needs to happen.\n\nOr, third option, you could try being non-monogamous with your SO.

Instead of \"Yes, I'm male\" it's more of a \"Shrug, yeah, I guess I'm male, whatever.\"  You could be agender, where you don't really have an internal gender.  It's more of a \"well, the body I'm in is male, so let's go with that\", no feeling of gender at all, or even feeling like your gender identity is missing, like there's a void where it should be.\n\nSome people say that if you're not cis then you're trans.  I disagree.  I think you can be non-binary without being trans, especially if you're demi or agender.  To me, you can't be a different gender than your physical sex (trans) if you don't have a gender (agender).  It's a divide-by-zero problem.\n\nThe feeling you get when your friend refers to you in a non-cis way might simply be because it affirms that you're not cis without judgement.

I'll bring it up in the future if I ever want or need to\". it's fine to say \"look I don't really have words for this but the things you're assuming about transition feel wrong for me and right now I'm really just happy with how things are and I'll come to you if anything changes\"\n\nit's totally fine to enjoy a gender experience with one person and not want other people to change how they treat you\n\nnot having an answer or words is an absolutely fine answer. saying that a common narrative doesn't apply to you but that you don't know what does is a fine answer. explaining that this isn't a big deal for you at the moment and you'd like it not to be a big deal with her is totally ok  \n\nbut your wife noticed something about how your behavior and very gently and with great respect for your feelings and with great sensitivity asked if there was something that you were going through. and when your said yes and didn't elaborate, she gave you time and space and didn't push you for answers. she very gently checked in with your months later. did she actually know how you were feeling and what you wanted? no. she had vague guesses of what it might entail because you've never discussed any of this with her so she's going off of common stories and other people's experiences. ok so she guessed wrong. and maybe it even threw you because you've so intensely categorised your own experience of gender as nothing having to do with being trans that her assumptions were shocking to you  \n\nbut then you were kinda a dick to her. and have still told her less and explained to her less than you've explained to reddit. which okay, explaining anonymously on a forum is a much much lower stakes deal than explaining to your wife. and with anonymity you have a of freedom to change your mind and experiment. if your understand of yourself changes in a few days or weeks or months or years you can just create a new account that reflects what's currently going on with your identity. there's no baggage. no justification. nothing you do needs to be permanent and nothing you do needs to have especially big weight\n\nbut even if you're not ready to tell her what is going on with you, even if you don't have those words.... at the very least you can tell her that you don't know, aren't planning any big changes, and don't want it to be a big deal. your can give her at the very least some kind of road map for how to interact with you on this. even if the roadmap is just \"this isn't a big deal, right now can we just go about our normal lives\"\n\nI get being afraid of her response or afraid that she will make something a bigger deal than you want, or afraid that she'll ask questions you aren't prepared to answer. but if you want her to act like this isn't a big deal, you need to tell her that\n\n**btw all of the above is assuming the best case scenario.** it's assuming that this actually a gender thing and not just that you enjoy being publicly \"humiliated\" by this \"friend\" - because that sounds less like a gender thing and more like a fetish. it's assuming that this is a woman who you can actually trust and talk to. if you don't think your wife is open minded about gender or anything else and if you don't trust her, *you should not be married to her*. if this \"nickname\" thing isn't an exploration of gender and isn't something purely platonic, then you're hiding a intimate and fetishistic relationship you have with someone else from your wife and using gender identity to do it\n\ngiven that you've changed your story on Reddit multiple times, either you *know* that what you're doing is fucked up and are trying to hide that, or you have such deep issues with your experience of gender that you'd prefer to confess to an intimate fetishistic relationship with a \"friend\" that you're hiding from your wife", "uhhh yeah there's a bigger issue here than the conversation between you and her", "YTA you\u2019re cheating on your fianc\u00e9e", "But OP didn\u2019t say no like you would.

He confides in us, absolute strangers but not his fianc\u00e9e? He likes the jokes between him and his friend, but doesn\u2019t want his fianc\u00e9e to be a part of it? Why? \n\nIt seems to me, from what OP wrote, that the fianc\u00e9e comes off as a very sweet person who wants to be there for OP in anyway she can because she was led to believe that OP struggled with his identity. Because instead of being honest with her, he was evasive with how he really perceived his gender identity; he tells us he\u2019s apathetic but he couldn\u2019t tell her. Maybe because if he had been honest with her, the inside jokes between him and his friend wouldn\u2019t mean as much. And if he was really honest with himself, he would let his fianc\u00e9e go and he can pursue who he really wants.\n\nEdited: I mean to reply to the other comment but now I\u2019m too tired to even try to fix this on the mobile app. I\u2019ve reddited enough today.", "Oh they definitely have a thing for their friend, \"the humiliation of it is fun\"?
