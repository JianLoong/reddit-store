I never met my biological father or mother, but knew I was adopted from day one. I also know that my bio mom was 15 when she had me and my bio dad was in his 20s. My parents have a biological daughter, my sister, 25F, who is in grad school and has student debt, whereas I got a full ride to do my undergrad. \n\nThis year, I took a DNA test, to learn about what cultures I belong to and genetics I have, also to screen from any genetic diseases. I discovered I am predisposed to certain allergies I didn't know about, and I also discovered several matches. And when I saw the last name, I didn't think anything of it.\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago, I received a phone call from a family law office asking if I was who I claimed to be and we spoke for a little bit. I was asked to join a Zoom meeting later on, and when I did, I saw my bio grandmother for the first time I started welling up. She and I have the same colour eyes and I have her nose. I didn't know how cathartic seeing somebody who resembled you felt and I started to cry. We chatted for a few minutes before getting down to business. I was shown legal credentials proving this was a real attorney's office and I was asked to show some photo ID. \n\nI asked what was going on when my grandmother told me the truth. My bio dad is a trust fund baby, and he is RICH RICH, as a middle-class person this was a huge shock. After my bio family found out he had a kid and told nobody about me, they were furious. My grandmother wants to change over my bio-dad's trust to me. I won't say how much for privacy reasons but I could live on it for the rest of my life, donate to charity every year and still have a shitton left over. It is major \"Fuck You\" money. My bio-grandmother also said that because she has funds for her other grandchildren, I would receive one of those in addition to my bio-dad's trust. She told me my bio dad is single and it won't affect anyone but him. She also said she would want to find my bio mom to compensate her as well.\n\nThe lawyer told me I should obtain a family law attorney and that my bio family would pay for them so I can obtain what my grandmother calls \"the money I deserve\". I obtained two attorneys, one family and one estate, and they are walking me through the process of obtaining the funds\n\n I told my family about it, and they talked about how my sister could finally be a professional student and how their mortgage could be paid off. When I told them how the fund works, giving an allowance every month instead of being a free-for-all, their tune changed.\n\nThey said I am THEIR family and should refuse the funds out of principle. I really want to accept the fund and meet and reconnect with my biological family, but I don't want to lose my family while making the decision. So WIBTA if I accepted this money from my biological family?", "created_utc": 1700074665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w0tje/wibta_if_i_accept_a_large_sum_of_money_from_my/", "score": 4156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your adoptive family should be ecstatic that you'll be set for life.  I'm glad you have attorneys to help navigate you through this.\n\nEdit:  Please be really careful of your biological father.  The fact that your bio grandmother is going to switch his trust to you makes this a bit more important to be careful.  Especially as he guilty of statutory rape (at least).", "NTA, so it was ok to have the money when they could take it from you, but not when it could just help you.", "NTA. Accept the money & meet your bio family - they clearly want to build a relationship with you. As for your family, they changed their tune immediately after you told them you couldn\u2019t pay off their debt. It sounds like they only don\u2019t want you to accept the money, because they can\u2019t get access to it. Principle had very little to do with this. They ought to be happy for you, not just thinking about themselves.", "NTA, work with your lawyer and accept the funds. The monthly sum is the ideal way to inherit this sort of income. That way people can't abuse it and you will always be taken care of. Also enables you to get and keep a job knowing that if you get laid off or switch careers you have a regular cushion.", "NTA\n\nAnd your adoptive family's reaction is disturbing.

Lol.\n\nTheir are just jealous.\n\nYou are entitled to this money. You deserve it. Your grandmother gets to decide, and she wants you to have it. End of the story.\n\nAccept it, no hesitation. Your family is way selfish if they want to take you away from a very stable futur juste for the sake of \"principle\".\n\nNTA.", "Congratulations, you just learned the first lesson of money: don't tell people you have it. Only bad things happen when people know you have lots of money. \n\nTell them you refused the money, actually take it, and keep your mouth shut unless you want a relationship so toxic with your family that you stop speaking to them.  \n\nI'm overreacting, I can feel you think as you read this. But I'm not.  Anyone who tells you to give up a life free from work, rent, and being one car accident away from homelessness just because they wont be rich too, isn't someone who loves you. \n\nKeep. This. To. Yourself. Pretend you still work. Never.  Ever tell them.  Ever.", "WTF?  NTA to accept this money.  NTA\n\n\"how their mortgage could be paid off. \"\n\nWoah.  They are NOT entitled to your money like that, even if it was a free for all.  Your adoptive parents are greedy as hell.", "NTA, forget about the money for a second, you are being offered an oppertunity to get your know your grandparents.  Thats the important thing here.  Take it with both hands and accept them into your life, its your right.\n\nAs for the cash, right now your adoptive family probably have no idea how to process this news.  So right now their mouths are engaging without the brain being in gear.

You are an adult and need to make the decision for yourself. If you wish to help out your adopted family that is your choice to do so or not. I cant promise anything about reactions, but just know you arent in the wrong.

You probably have the grounding to make good use of the money.", "NTA take the money and put it to good use. You are going to find out how money changes people even family but don't let that stop you from having financial security. The first thing you should do is get your adopted family therapy to suggest you should refuse the money out of principal.

Accept the money. Why in earth not? And why aren't your parents over-the-moon happy for you?", "When the family thought the money was coming to you all at once and that you could help them. It was OK but now that it\u2019s a trust that you cannot use for them it\u2019s not OK and I think that is an absolute ridiculous thing for them to do. \n\nPlease pursue the relationship, but make sure you still keep your relationship with your adoptive family. You are NTA. \n\n**Apparently, if it was known, your biological grandmother might\u2019ve taken you in and things might have been different, and if they are being so open and generous, there is no reason for you to not accept because you deserve it.**", "First off, NTA. You should make arrangements to meet up with your Bio-Grandmother...I think you two could have a lasting relationship, because it sounds like your adopted family are going money-crazy. When your adopted family found out about the money, they immediately started spending it as if it was theirs. You're 20 and an adult and what you do with YOUR money is up to you. But you should have a sit down with your adopted parents and let them know how you feel about their attitude shift and why would they want to deny you money?", "NTA - your adoptive parents should love you enough to support you in connecting with your biological family.\nThey should also be thrilled to know you will never struggle financially in the future.", "I would take it. Money is money and everyone needs it. \u201cLoyalty\u201d doesn\u2019t enter into it IMO because nobody hurt your parents. This money is not dirty in some way, it\u2019s a benefit you didn\u2019t know you had and frankly, your family\u2019s reaction is bizarre. \n\nNTA", "Take the money and run!", "Definite NTA as long as you feel comfortable and you\u2019re aware of whether there are any potential\nstrings. It sounds like you\u2019re being sensible by engaging legal advice.\n\nFor me, I would be hurt at my family\u2019s response.

Which principle is that?! \n\nNTA. Take the money, try to maintain the relationship as much as you can and reconnect with your bio fam but don\u2019t allow either side to disrespect the other. I have a feeling one side will make the choice much easier real soon", "This is such a once in a million lifetimes opportunity that you would be stupid not to take it. You would be setting yourself up for life. Down the line, then you could help your family, just maybe not at first since its not how it works. \n\nWhat you are going through is basically what many people dream to happen to them constantly. TAKE THE DAMN MONEY. If not, let me pose as you and ill take the damn money lol", "You have no idea how glad I was to read you\u2019re 20 and not still a child legally bounded to your parents. \n\nNTA at all. These people wanted money they could take advantage of, not because it was to your benefit. \n\nThey\u2019re not your family, they\u2019re selfish people who don\u2019t want what\u2019s best for you.", "NTA. Take it. Sad your adoptive family changed their tune when they realised they wouldn't get a cash handout. Take the money and live a good life with it.", "NTA. You are in a tough spot but your adoptive family is not entitled to the money. Money does this to people, and I\u2019m sure they are good people. If you help them, you should do it on your terms. It would have also been prudent for biograndma to anticipate this and put some sort of clause in the trust or whatever. \nIf you feel like it, you might think about asking your trust attorney about something like that \u2014 an irrevocable trust for your adoptive family \u2014 something that settles the issue definitively so that your adoptive family doesn\u2019tcontinuously make repeated claims to your money. \nAt any rate, the money is yours, you or your gma should put it into a trust that no one else can touch but you.", "NTA\nAnd you WNBTA if you accepted the money. I really wish your family would give you the space and respect you deserve to take your time and really come to terms with what\u2019s being offered you. IMO I think it was weird of them to bring up all the stuff you can help with. Sure you can do all that but they should let you do that on your own , on your own terms, and not pressure you in any way from the jump. \n\nGet a lawyer, take some time to yourself. Tell your family you love them and need them to trust and support you right now with everything you will be going through. More money more problems isnt a saying for nothing unfortunately. manifesting a good outcome with your family here. Both adoptive and biological.\n\nBut you can\u2019t feel guilty for taking money being legally and ethically offered to you.", "Oh, I laughed at this one...NTA of course! This money has nothing to do with them. \n\nAnd I have to say the adoptive family doesn't sound very nice if their first reaction was that they could leech off you! And I don't get the logic of why, because you get it as an allowance and thus won't have as much to share, you should then refuse it?\n\nI want to say take the money and run. At the very least, hold on to those lawyers, you may need further legal help if the adoptive family somehow tries to take the $$ from you.\n\nI can see how it would be sad for you to lose them, as the primary family you knew, but maybe now you're learning who they really are...", "NTA. \n\nI'm guessing your adoptive family is scared that this money will change things between you guys, and that's why they're saying what they are, but their approach is definitely the asshole one. \n\nYou can develop relationships with your bio family (if you want to) and still maintain close ones with your adoptive family. Hopefully with time and as they see that you're still the same person and you're not cutting them off things will improve.", "NTA.  Take the money.  Your adoptive family was all good until they realized they weren't going to get rich quick.  If they can't get the amount of money they want then they don't want you to have the benefit of financial security either.  This is very selfish of them and they should be happy for you.", "NTA-\nWhy would you turn down an opportunity to help yourself (and your adoptive family if you want, but you seriously don\u2019t owe them this) if your bio family seriously wants to give it to you? For pride? \nThat\u2019s like shooting yourself in the foot. \n\nId put them on an information diet and accept what you\u2019re entitled to. \nThey\u2019re probably scared you\u2019d abandon them in favor of the bio family, but that\u2019s still no excuse to be a jerk to you about it", "NTA - and I'm glad you're getting attorneys lined up. They can help you navigate your adopted family also. Your adopted family is going to have to swallow the bitter pill that they adopted you of their own free will and you don't owe them anything. If you're willing and able to give them something, more power to you. But, you don't owe them a dime now or ever.", "NTA\n\nTake the money. Your family has already shown you are not important to them.", "Take the money and live your best life.  NTA", "NTA your parents are the biggest AH I have ever heard of. Get the money ASAP, and don\u2019t give them any cash, they can continue living their lives normally. Money is put on trust funds exactly to avoid people exploiting you. I\u2019m glad your bio grandma is a smart woman.\n\nAnd again, regardless of family, adoption or whatever, in this economy you don\u2019t turn down money.", "NTA. That's really sad that when they thought they had easy access, it was different. \nYou have one life to live. You didn't choose any of your parents. \nI hope you take it, learn where you come from, AND your parents come around.", "Get your own attorney. Do not take one at the suggestion of the family. Do not let them pay for it. \n\nIf it is \u201cfuck you\u201d money, the lawyers will work out a payment plan that lets you pay them after your trust is available to you. \n\nNTA\u2014it is quite literally your birthright, and if everything they\u2019ve said is true, a costly signal your extended birth family is making to try and make up for what happened.", "Take the money, don't tell anyone.

Accept the money, put it away and don't mention it to your adopted parents or sister, they are showing their true colors. Go meet your grandma, get your questions answered and enjoy a positive relationship with her.", "NTA- Go get that money and keep it to yourself.", "NTA. Take the money. You deserve it, and  it is rightfully yours.", "Take the money. Go and visit your bio grandma. You might find it is interesting.", "NTA, take the money, but be aware that your family may be afraid of losing you to the money and the bio family, lay down some reassurance.", "NTA, wow, so once they heard you would only get a momthly stipend instead of the whole thing then their tune changed. Next they will be accusing bio family of splitting up a family and being greedy.", "She wants to compensate your mom because it was statutory rape by law. I wonder how she got pregnant though. \n\nAccept the money, it\u2019s life changing. \n\nNTA", "NTA accept it and have a good life.  Don\u2019t let jealousy from your adoptive family prevent you from having the means to have a good life", "NTA- take the money and secure your future.\n\nYou don\u2019t need your adopted family\u2019s approval , they\u2019re being greedy.", "NTA, Life SUCKS HARD right now, we are in a worse economic state than the Great Depression and if you have the opportunity to get a great sum of money that will make your life easier, take it. There is no reason to turn down this money out of any sense of obligation. Live your life the best way you can.", "Take the money.\n\nI adopted two boys and I would love for them to have your experience.", "NTA - it is unfortunate that your adopted family is feeling this way, but can you really blame them?  This money is LIFE CHANGING.  If it were me, I would find a way for your adopted family to get a little but the rest is yours.  This is the lottery, OP.  You cannot turn this opportunity down because this is what dreams are made of.  Your focus should be on you.  You are a good person from what I can tell and aren't the Bobby Sue type to take the money and run.  Have faith in  yourself and the process because I don't see why ALL parties involved won't come out on top.", ">I told my family about it, and they talked about how my sister could finally be a professional student and how their mortgage could be paid off. When I told them how the fund works, giving an allowance every month instead of being a free-for-all, their tune changed.\n\n>They said I am THEIR family and should refuse the funds out of principle.\n\nSo they were all for you taking money, until they realised they could not benefit? \n\nTake the money, OP. It'll allow you to live your life without debt or ever worrying about money. You should not turn down that opportunity. \n\nBut like others have said, be very, very careful.

But if it\u2019s really so much money, like, more than you need a month, you could think about giving part of it to fund your sister\u2019s education, if you have a really good relationship and you want to do that. Don\u2019t let your parents force this on you. But don\u2019t listen to me, I\u2019m half socialist.", "NTA. It is your bio grandmas choice on what to do with her money so no problem there. As far as your adopted family goes, they should be excited for you to get something that is so beneficial to you, not saying you shouldn't take it. You have every right to take that money. And I'm willing to bet, based on their initial reaction, they won't disown you once you get money. I'd be more worried about the trying to \"borrow\" money from you. Be careful and I'm so happy you are receiving a blessing.", "NTA.  How much does your family really care if they were cool with telling you how to spend it on them.....sounds a lot jealous.  If you choose to do anything for them with your money that is fine.  But, their response isn't like oh we love you so much and are so happy for you that you found this out.  Part of it could be concern that you will replace them because this family has money but....it also could just be some true colors.  Be cautious", "NTA and there are people who would give almost anything to get that kind of windfall. It is life changing.

I love mine too. But if I never had to work another day in my life thanks to being rich and they got mad and cut me off or something for it, that's their problem. \n\nThat said, when all this goes down, make sure you have a damn good security setup.

You don't have to refuse the money, and I don't see why it means you shouldn't be able to help your adoptive family if you want. This money mightn't change your lives over night, but its a good bit of extra income and could probably go a long way, even if it comes in increments. How you should or shouldn't use it isn't what you were asking, and its not what I am commenting on.

I\u2019m sorry because money changes people", "NTA at all. I would think that your adoptive parents would be happy that you are going to be taken care of. Hopefully this reaction was just a temporary shocked/processing moment. As you know, it is a lot/big change completely unexpectedly, so hopefully after they have a little more time to think they will have a better response. \n\nI don't have any personal experience with adoption, but from things I have read, it seems within the norm that you parents might have feelings of inadequacy because they could never provide you with that kind of money (most people realistically couldn't) or concerns about losing you to your bio family or that you just won't need/want them anymore once you have the money. I think their initial reaction of getting benefits from the money wasn't necessarily malicious either, but a way for it to be integrated into your family instead of the money taking you away from them. (Of course, you know them better than I do, so if they are usually entitled people who overstep and expect freebies and stuff then disregard that last part.)\n\nYou didn't mention whether your parents knew about you taking the genetic screening or having contact with your bio family before you told them about the money part, but especially if they found out all of it at once, it probably stirred up a lot of different feelings, so their reaction about the money might not actually be totally about the money. \n\nIykyk-It's not about the Iranian yogurt.", "NTA\n\nAdoptee as well.

What is missing here?  \nAlso, i am a bit hesitant to say the truth about this huge inheritance. Be careful who you talk to and hire lawyers that you pay with your own money, not money from the new bio family. You need to be very well protected.", "Take the money! Don\u2019t tell\nAnyone else.

I never met my biological father or mother, but knew I was adopted from day one. I also know that my bio mom was 15 when she had me and my bio dad was in his 20s. My parents have a biological daughter, my sister, 25F, who is in grad school and has student debt, whereas I got a full ride to do my undergrad. \n\nThis year, I took a DNA test, to learn about what cultures I belong to and genetics I have, also to screen from any genetic diseases. I discovered I am predisposed to certain allergies I didn't know about, and I also discovered several matches. And when I saw the last name, I didn't think anything of it.\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago, I received a phone call from a family law office asking if I was who I claimed to be and we spoke for a little bit. I was asked to join a Zoom meeting later on, and when I did, I saw my bio grandmother for the first time I started welling up. She and I have the same colour eyes and I have her nose. I didn't know how cathartic seeing somebody who resembled you felt and I started to cry. We chatted for a few minutes before getting down to business. I was shown legal credentials proving this was a real attorney's office and I was asked to show some photo ID. \n\nI asked what was going on when my grandmother told me the truth. My bio dad is a trust fund baby, and he is RICH RICH, as a middle-class person this was a huge shock. After my bio family found out he had a kid and told nobody about me, they were furious. My grandmother wants to change over my bio-dad's trust to me. I won't say how much for privacy reasons but I could live on it for the rest of my life, donate to charity every year and still have a shitton left over. It is major \"Fuck You\" money. My bio-grandmother also said that because she has funds for her other grandchildren, I would receive one of those in addition to my bio-dad's trust. She told me my bio dad is single and it won't affect anyone but him. She also said she would want to find my bio mom to compensate her as well.\n\nThe lawyer told me I should obtain a family law attorney and that my bio family would pay for them so I can obtain what my grandmother calls \"the money I deserve\".

Your family\u2019s behavior is not at all excusable. It is also, very likely, not about what they are saying it is about. This situation makes them feel that their connection to you has been threatened \u2014 a connection that they are likely already insecure about because you are adopted. They have an instinctive feeling that you will leave them behind and run, run, run; they are reacting to this immaturely. Parents are especially likely to react this way, especially if they were a little tight for money and couldn\u2019t give you everything you wanted growing up.\n\nI\u2019d say allow them some time to process it, and meanwhile secure your life using the money. Basically, don\u2019t burn all bridges with them yet, but be prepared to do so if their bad behavior continues. Also watch your own behavior so that you don\u2019t unnecessarily exacerbate their insecurities (e.g. don\u2019t bring up blatant comparisons between your middle-class childhood to the life you are about to have).\n\nAlso, instead of seeing your family as a monolith, try to analyze how each individual reacted. If, for example, your parents\u2019 tune changed while your sister just went silent, perhaps a separate conversation with your sister is important. If she is less entitled to your money, it might be a great idea to ease her life with a cut of the allowance.

The person wrote multiple comments/comment threads (he commented after himself due to word length), but I suggest jumping to the 2nd comment. The first comment is a danger/warning about your situation, and the downfalls. But the 2nd comment is where he starts to give advice.\n2. Step 1 is DON'T TELL ANYONE about your win-fall. I'm sorry, but it's true, and even though you have this amazing life changing thing happening to you and you want to share it, most \"working class\" people will look at you differently. Your current friends will probably change (\"you can totally afford to buy me what I want\"), any current partners will change how they act (suddenly asking you like you're a sugar momma), and other acquaintances will start pushing you for money. It's best to just not share it with anyone, and just enjoy being \"set for life\" without telling anyone.\n3. Step 2 is get an attorney and CPA/Accountant. Sounds like you're doing that, great! Keep going, and now that you have the funds, keep 1 on retainer\n4. Step 3 is plan on the amount of money to gift to your friends and family (if you choose to do so). Give this gift through legal means, and then leave it at that.\n5. Everything after this is a lot more technical about what to do with your money, so I'll let you read that on your own. 1 - 3 above is the important stuff, so start there and move through the process as it gets there.\n\nGood luck!!! I wish you all the best, and hope you have fun with your new life and new bio family!!!!\n\nAnd please don't let your adoptive family kill your joy. This should be celebrated, and they should be happy for you. They suck for being selfish.", "Nice to see that you turned out well despite the adoptive family's attitude.", "Do you think this was a knee jerk reaction of your parents feeling they may be left behind in your life?", "Hi you need to start lying and say u didn\u2019t take it to\nUr adoptive parents they were ready to take advantage of that money and now are jealous and bitter they don\u2019t want you to take it just because they can\u2019t spend it pLs move out away from them", "My family situation is similar - my little sister is adopted and almost 5 years younger, but I\u2019m biologically related to our parents.

She needs to reassure her adoptive family that she isn't turning her back in them and might help them a little even if she doesn't owe it to them as they adopted her and it was their job to support her through her life.

And a lot of adoptive parents have that savior complex, because that's how adoption has been portrayed in the media and culture for decades: benevolent parents-to-be 'saving' an abandoned and unwanted baby from destitution and deprivation. When in reality, there are DOZENS of potential adoptive parents waiting YEARS to buy each infant that goes up for adoption, there's no such thing as abandoned babies in orphanages waiting to be rescued.", "It reads more like the free ride was scholarships not from the parents.", "The money is relatively new business money, nothing well known, but successful.", "This is totally the answer.  Although if adoptive family continues their grabby hands., remind them that it is a trust. Usually, trust funds have a limitation before paying out, such as ag,  etc.   Even better get to know grandmother ahe probably could set it up so that you don't  get any of it until you become anadult then you can decide where it goes, like helping adopted sister or paying some of parents mortgage", "Assuming that: does such money belong in the hands of unethical people? The money can be used for unethical reinvestment. So follow this, taking the money and using it for normal life would be a net positive.", "You don't have to pay back until you're out of school, which apparently she isn't, and in the US your payback is based on your income, which she doesn't have. Sounds like OP is going to school on scholarships with no help from her adoptive family, why should she be responsible for paying her sister's loans or tuition? She's not.", "I don't concern myself with what people have done in the past.  It used to be socially acceptable to own slaves.  We evolve.  \n\nAs for places having more lax laws than others, any place that would legally would be okay with this situation is in the wrong", "Well, my opinion would be to take it pretty much regardless. Your bio-dad was a dick who statutory raped a teenager and your grandma seems to have the sense to say \u201cfuck that guy\u201d. Money would be better off in your hands than his. \n\n\nAnd if your adoptive family wants to be dicks about it, they also suck it. If you do want to help your adoptive family some, you can also do that. It doesn\u2019t need to be huge things where you pay for your sister\u2019s whole lives. It could be nice Christmas gifts or a vacation or nothing. Honestly the trust is perfect for that since it\u2019s always a perfect excuse why you can\u2019t give anyone tons of money. \u201cSorry, the trust wouldn\u2019t allow that\u201d and bam, done. Not that you should need an excuse, but having one is great.", "I think your adoptive family thinking to cling onto your bio money is a little gross, but I wouldn\u2019t look into it too much. I have a few thoughts from my career on this, and yes, newfound money does complicate things a bit, however for people who have means, its all just business and most of them wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at you getting some additional money if you were already in a family with wealth.\n\nI may be generous here, since there are obviously selfish motivations as well that are and can be in play.  However, iI am sure your family it feels like there is an attack on the unit. You are all family, and in it together, raised together, etc\u2026 but not really because you are afforded a windfall. So in a very simplistic sociological grouping of being in or out of the group, you are in the middle now.\n\nOf course this is nonsense, and you should take the money, and if you want to and are able to, you should help your sibling. Just realize what may seem as selfish money issues, really have an emotional underpinning. Most money issues are really emotional.", "Definitely NTA--and consult a full-service financial planner, if you can find one these days.  I mean, somebody who sells life insurance, disability insurance, advises you about mutual funds, the whole enchilada.", "Can\u2019t you negotiate the lump sum part to get enough of a lump sum to help your sister pay her tuition and your parents pay the mortgage?", "I think Bio Grandmother will disown her son effectively anyway, now that she knows the truth.\nSo I barely see how OPs actions are affecting her Bio father. All OP did was take a genetic test and speak truthfully. The hot water Bio dad is in now was setup and put under pressure by Bio Dad himself.\nSure, Bio Dad will blame it all on OP, but OP not accepting  the money would not make it his money. I think that accepting the money puts Biodad in a better position within the family, even if he does not realize it: Bio grandma gets her awesome Bio grand daughter into the family. By grandma can partally patch up a family wrong doing. By rejecting the money, OP effectively refuses her Bio family (which she is absolutely allowed to do!). Bio grandma would rightfully blame that rejection on OPs Bio Dad.", "Most trusts do not allow this kind of thing.  And for good reason."]}
