You bought the house that was best for you and your needs and there is nothing wrong with that. Has your mother even complained yet?", "NTA. There are hotels. Your house is for you, not them. Many houses don't have bedrooms on the first floor. Are you supposed to find a house without steps, too? Only ramps? I hope they don't expect to live with you in the future.", "NTA\n\nThey can get a hotel if/when they visit.", "NTA - based on the post but why would they expect that? \n\nWas there a discussion at some point? Did they give you money? Did your mum do this for her parents? Or a cultural expectation?", "NTA-unless they gave you the money to buy a house with an extra room on the bottom floor.", "NTA - but you do need to think about what level of interaction do you want with your mom going forward?\n\nI read your comments, and she apparently comes to visit a lot.  If you planned for that to continue, then why didn\u2019t you consider their needs?  Could it be that she cares more about visiting you regularly than you do?\n\nalso, a lot of people had their grandma come live with them later in her life.  That\u2019s just what was done because there was no such thing as senior living communities catering to the Needs of seniors to give them fulfilling lives in their elder years.  Thanks to the baby boomer generation, there are lots of options for seniors to live on their own and enjoy senior activities without moving into their adult children\u2019s homes.\n\nso, I think you need to think about what you want out of your life and that may not match up with what your mother wants.  That\u2019s ok, because you are an adult and you are entitled to make your own decisions about how you live your life and how often you interact with your mom and her husband.\n\nhave you ever decline a request from your mom to visit you?  OR have you changed your plans to accommodate her request to visit?  I ask because it\u2019s not clear and at your age, your life should be filled with adventures, etc and not have time for regular overnight visits from your mom.\n\nI am not saying it is wrong, but if you picked the house you wanted without giving a thought to what your mom would need when she visits, that sorta of implies that she visits when she wants, not necessarily when you want a visit.  That implies you reacting to her requests to visit like a child who feels they must comply with the request rather than an adult who politely, but firmly declines when you have plans.\n\nhope this helps.", "NTA unless part of your house buying plan was letting them move in with you or they sleep at your new house every week. If you feel so inclined, get yourself a nice sleeper sofa that they can sleep on when they stay overnight.", "NAH \n\nWould\u2019ve been nice for you to get a house with a bedroom on the first floor if they\u2019re regular visitors but it\u2019s certainly NOT AH behaviour to not do so\n\nOn their end it\u2019s a legitimate concern, all of this is based on the fact I\u2019m assuming they have been regular visitors in the past and you expect them to continue visiting regularly", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is valid for many people. It might be hurtful if your mom was a frequent visitor though who thought she was welcome and just found out that she was not so much.\n\nI am looking at houses and not really considering my elderly parent or other guests because my parent has not been to my house is 5 years or more and no one has stayed at our home for years. The needs of the people who will live there daily outweigh needs of potential visitors. If my parent were seriously going to be at my house a lot I\u2019d consider him more.", "NTA", "Yes, she complained/worried almost immediately, and told me about the stairs issue.", "I think this must be the real reason they are upset.

I've never declined a request from her to visit me, and I don't have to change my plans to accommodate her request to visit because she helps so much with the kids when she visits.

I would be upset in your mom\u2019s shoes if I were visiting regularly to take care of the kids, cook, clean, and you bought a house that makes it difficult for her husband to visit too.\n\nit seems like you and your mom have different expectations.
