You grew up with your dad, you clearly think he's garbage, I would imagine you can understand why she'd feel that way?

She may have some affection for u and don't get her to see her big bro.", "YTA why bother going home if you don\u2019t want to be there? Cut ties with your dad and end the relationship. That will stop your young sister from becoming attached to you. \n\nYou are 23 you don\u2019t need to stay at your dad home.", "I'm guessing you are the kind of person who can look at a person dying in a car crash without flinching.\nStill NTA, but mostly because your sister is probably safer on the other side of that door.", "Karma is a bitch", "NTA but i am a little worried she goes to you and not her parents. it could just be shes excited when you visit and she wants to be around you but it could be something a whole lot worse", "NTA-- but it sounds like your dad makes their life pretty miserable whether you visit or not. \n\nI'd consider that if you know any information or have insight as to why this may be occurring,  you're an adult and you are free to cut them out of your life if you need to. You are also free to report them if you need to. \n\nI know kids have nightmares, but idk, I just don't get the feeling that your parents are your bffs", "Your Eldest cousin is a turd, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised If she was the one that took your makeup in the first incident and then just let her siblings play with it.", "You\u2019re NTA at all.  Your stepmother sounds awful and I\u2019m a stepmom myself.  \n\nOne thing you can try is tell your little sister that it makes you uncomfortable sharing a bed (if that\u2019s the issue) but she can make a little bed on the floor so she can be closer to you.", ">literally a stranger \n\nWhy are you saying that OP is a stranger? OP visits twice a year and she knows them as their sibling.", "Grain of salt here, but as someone who was in a similar situation the answer was definitely neglect. It's like your brain is starving and you rely on crumbs of wellbeing to get by.", "Fucking this ! \nKids look up to older siblings like hero's ffs", "a nightmare doesnt kill you", "I totally agree.", "Karma is a bitch.", "1. She is forced to be there\n2.She has no obligation to have a relation with someone she doesnt want to\n3.she only visits there twice \n4. Its not her job \n5. THE KID HAS PARENTS OP IS NOT HER PARENT.\n6.The only AHs here are the parents", "Yeah it's definitely strange", "In your case I understand but in OPs case it seems different. It's one thing to want to spend time with family but when the child is scared they run to OP not the parents.", "^ murica comment", "From the post I think it\u2019s like a sacrificial visit to prevent Dad making Mom\u2019s and siblings\u2019 lives more difficult?"]}
