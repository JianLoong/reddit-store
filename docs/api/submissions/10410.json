Her actual parents should understand and respect that. \n\nINFO: What doe she do when she has a nightmare and you aren't visiting?  \n\n\nEDITED to give judgement.", "NTA, but your younger sister needs help imo.\n\nShe\u2019s a kid but literally a stranger who has parents who are At Home and she\u2019s not really your responsibility. Plus you already voiced your concerns (to her and her parents) but it didn\u2019t work.\n\nKinda suspicious that she goes to you, again a stranger, instead of her parents when she\u2019s having nightmares. That says a lot.", "NTA. You are basically a stranger if you're only there twice a year so why does she cling to you? But when you visit I'd advise getting a hotel room. No need to stay at the house", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat kid has PARENTS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Stop letting your AH dad guilt you into coming.

You only have to put up with it two nights a year. Something is definitely not right.", "NTA as you are not the kid\u2019s parent.  \n\nHowever I feel incredibly sad for this child.  Imagine, she feels safest with you, basically a stranger who visits twice a year, over the two adults who are supposed to take care of her.", "NTA. This whole thing sounds like a toxic situation. Your father *forces* you to visit? Your sister tries to run to you--a brother she barely knows--for comfort after what sounds like regular nightmares? \n\nInfo: Is your sister's mother your mother also? If yes, why do you call her \"her mother\" and not \"my mother\"?", "NTA. You need to talk to dad and stepmom and explain you will not parent their child for them. Dad can force you to visit but he can't make parent your sister. Dad and stepmom need to get on the same page regarding your visiting and how neither can order you around. One telling you that you have to stay and the other saying you have to go doesn't work. Tell dad you won't stay if she persists on being rude.", "NTA but I'm pretty worried about your sister if she'd far rather run to you, a stranger by almost all accounts, for comfort over her guardians. There's something very wrong there. I don't think you should be taking on that responsibility, but I think you need to turn the eyes of the extended family in on this situation too. Is there a figurative head of family that could swoop through here to determine what in the world is going on for this to be happening? Based on where a young child is supposed to be with healthy attachment, they should be going to a parent for a nightmare, not somebody they barely know.", "I was so ready to come and declare you an asshole but NTA . You didn't exactly lock her out. You locked your room from inside before she could enter. You didn't throw a scared kid out in the middle of the night. It was not her room i am assuming. She must have some way to deal with it since you barely visit. So its not on you. Its her parents concern.\n\nEdit- i reread and saw you didn't open the door when she was crying. It was none of your business but still you could have comforted her if her nightmares are real.", "Debating over ESH or NTA....\n1. Never should an adult be forced to share a bed with a child when they don't want to. This can lead to all sorts of trouble like molestation or charges of suspected molestation.\n2. Not his child. The parents of the girl should be the ones taking care of her (aside from emergencies which this was not).\n3. Everyone seems to be blaming each other instead of dealing with the main issues of their family dynamics.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA", "Info, please\n\nHow old are your siblings? How is he harder on them & your mother if you don't see him?", "NTA. You can leave anytime you're an adult. Your father can't force you to stay. Pretty sus that your little sister you barely see is seeking comfort from you someone who's practically a stranger to her. Something is very off about your sister's behavior. You said your dad makes life difficult for your siblings if you don't visit. Is your dad or step-mom abusive in anyway or is your sister just spoiled? Like why didn't she go to her parents why was her reaction go to you for comfort...practically crying? If there's any evidence of abuse happening, then I think that warrants a call to CPS.", "Yta.  You go to the door, take her by the hand to her mother and fathers room.  And open the door and let her in there.  Tell her gently that little girls don\u2019t sleep with big brothers but she can sleep with her mommy.", "It\u2019s not your child but she is your sister. Clearly something is going on. If you can give her some comfort in a time of need why wouldn\u2019t you? You might also want to look into contacting CPS. \n\nThis is such a weird story. How does your dad make you, a 23 yr old, stay there?", "ESH except the 5-year-old. her parents certainly aren't doing their jobs, but she's fucking five and you just sat in bed while she was yelling and crying?", "NTA your dad and step mother sound toxic after I would stay away as long as possible.", "YTA, she\u2019s a little kid and she\u2019s terrified. She is probably going to the first door she finds, thinking it\u2019s her parents room, while she is disoriented and scared. I had the EXACT same problem with my niece when I was living with my aunt and I never realized that until my aunt screamed at me for it. Babies aren\u2019t great at figuring out where their parents are at 4am.\n\n2 acceptable responses: Take her to her parents\u2019 door, make sure she gets in and can be with them. OR Take her to the kitchen, get her a snack, a toy that makes her comfortable, wait for her to calm down, and take her back to bed.\n\nI get that it\u2019s not your problem but that doesn\u2019t really matter when a toddler is alone and needs help.\n\nEdit: I assumed from personal experience that this is a very small child, if not, disregard but still consider she\u2019s your little sister and she was alone and scared.", "This sounds like a much bigger problem than this sub can process. But yeah, you're being a dick to a five year old.\n\nAt your age, you should be able to suit up and spend a week doing difficult work for the greater good.

I'm assuming step-something? (Can I get away with the word harl0t on this sub?) to do to anyone--you OR your sister. They should be done better, they sound like terrible parents. That said, the kid's FIVE. She isn't doing this maliciously, and a little consideration will help you see that; realize, if you can, the kid has her parents year round, and you for a week or two every year, but you're the adult she trusts and feels comforted by. You grew up with your dad, you clearly think he's garbage, I would imagine you can understand why she'd feel that way? It's not your responsibility to raise her, but you have to have a pretty black shriveled up lump in your chest to not feel a thing for her the two weeks or of the year you see her.

By doing that she actively teaches the child to do that to receive attention. Sure, in the short term it helps.
