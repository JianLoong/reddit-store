{"id": 15566, "submission_id": "12xfx3z", "title": "AITA for laughing at my gf when she suggested I should offer to pay the bill for her family?", "selftext": "My (23M) girlfriend (21F) and I have been together for a year and a half. Her family is super sweet and I get along great with them.\n\nNow my gf's dad is pretty well off. Every time I've gone out to dinner with her family he always foots the bill. Her family has been great to me. They always welcome me in their house. I went on a vacation with them back in the winter. Her parents paid for our hotel for the entire week, her dad gave her money for food (granted it was for her, her brother and myself), I also only paid for half of my flight because my gf offered to pay for the other half.  The only thing I really had to pay for is food a couple of days out of the trip, which my gf pitched in and helped with too.\n\nThis past weekend my gf, myself, her younger brother, and her dad went out for brunch. I was spending the weekend with her anyway so she invited me to join them. Before we left her and I were talking and she mentioned how maybe I should offer to pay for brunch, as in for all 4 of us. She assured me that her dad would 1000% refuse to let me pay, but he would probably really appreciate and respect me for offering.\n\nNow here's where I may sound like an AH but I honestly laughed at her suggesting this. I told her I would offer to cover our (her and my) portion of the bill, but to expect me to offer to cover the entire bill is obscured. Sure, I work a full time job and all of that, but I have my own bills and stuff to worry about too, and she wants me to offer to pay for a $150ish brunch?!\n\nShe told me that if her dad accepted, which she could 100% guarantee that he wouldn't, that she would send me half for the bill. I continued to laugh and told her I'm not doing that, I'll offer to pay for our half and that's it. I asked her if the roles were reversed if she would offer to pay for the bill for my family? (8 of us in total including my gf), she said that's completely different. That's 8 people, not 4.\n\nWe both have VERY different upbringings, in terms of the situation I mentioned about paying the bill. She grew up with a decently well off family where they would constantly argue on who would pay the bill, because everyone in her family would always offer out of courtesy. I grew up very differently as I come from a family that was not financially well off. If someone offered to foot the bill, you'd just sit back and let them do it.\n\nWhen we went to brunch I offered to cover both her and my portion of the bill, her dad immediately refused and covered the whole bill. She gave me a \"I told you so look\". She thinks I was an AH for how I reacted to the situation, and says I should've trusted her. She told me she needs some space because my reaction to the whole situation is kind of a turn off to her and she needs to think about thing's.

You apparently think that doing so is laughably ridiculous.  Sounds like the two of you come from wildly different cultures, but open mockery followed by refusing to understand where she (and by extension her family) is coming from is not a good sign.", "YTA  \nOP it's common courtesy to pay back the favor of at least offering to pay the bill once in a while, since you can afford to. Your gf's parents seem like generous and overall great people. You'd be doing yourself a disservice by not nurturing that relationship.  \n**The fact that they are well off doesn't mean that their generosity should be taken for granted, and it seems you're doing just that .**", "I grew up poor and I would never have acted like you. YTA. You are not generous at all and your girlfriend and her family are. Not even just that, but you *laughed* at her for even mentioning it. That\u2019s messed up, man. Seriously messed up. I can see why she is reconsidering.", "YTA. You are being so stingy. \n\n> her family has always been great to me\n\nAnd you don't think you could attempt to return the favor?", "You weren't obligateded to offer but yeah YTA for not having any modicum of courtesy / generosity given how much her father has treated you to. Do you have no shame or self-respect?\n\nAnd your GF was right that he wouldn't let you pay, plots no risk to your finances since she offered to pay half if she was wrong.\n\nYou sound like a leech. A selfish one too.\n\nDon't be surprised if your GFs attitude towards you is seriously damaged by this.", "So her family has paid for you many times and you can't even entertain the idea of OFFERING to pay even though you probably wouldn't even have to do it?\n\nHuge YTA", "Yup YTA, big time.\r  \n\r  \nThere are 2 things here:\r  \n\r  \nFirst, according to you, your GF\u2019s family has been crazy generous. You let them pay for a trip overseas, and you only paid \u00bd of the cost for your flight? Pride alone should have stopped you from allowing that to happen. You owe them, big time.\r  \n\r  \nSecond, your GF already said she\u2019d pay half the bill. So even if the father had accepted, you would have been out nothing.\r  \n\r  \nThis is about perception man, your upbringing is irrelevant here. It\u2019s time to grow a pair, realize how others see things for once, and live up to your half of the deal.\r  \n\r  \nShe\u2019s right, you\u2019re the AH, If you can\u2019t figure this out on your own, she deserves better.", "They paid for an entire week overseas holiday for you, the least you can do is offer to pay for brunch once.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. your free ride appears to be over. \n\ni can't imagine letting someone spend hundreds of dollars on me and not even think on my own to offer to pay them back somehow.", "YTA, her family has spent a lot of money on you. The least you can do is offer to pay brunch.", "YTA. \n\nWhy on earth would you laugh at her for suggesting you simply offer to give back to someone who has been so generous to you? You're putting off gold-digger type vibes, I understand why she wants some space.", "YTA. You have been freeloading 100s of dollars from her family and refuse to foot a 150$ bill. What a stingy AH.", "YTA\n\nand a moocher.", "You actually ended up looking like a bigger AH by offering to pay for only your portion of the bill. Considering it sounds like you've been the benefit of numerous dinners and travel plans, the fact that you wouldn't offer $150 one time does indeed make you sound selfish.  Especially since you knew her dad would refuse. Even if he had accepted, your girlfriend offered to pay half. You never would've had to pay more than the half. you agreed to pay out loud. So yeah, you shot yourself in the foot for no reason.", "YTA your happy to be a freeloader and she\u2019s trying to demonstrate to her father that you are not. You failed that test.", "YTA. Gather 'round, children, and let me tell you a story. For most of my life, my family was very much working class and living in an incredibly wealthy area surrounded by very rich people. I still don't really know how my parents made it work. My dad, bless his selfless heart, is one of the most generous humans I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. We didn't eat out very often, but my dad had a habit of sometimes choosing a random table and anonymously paying for their meal, as well. Most of the time, we were dining at places where the customer base was predominantly also middle/working class - think Denny's and other chains. It was very important to him to just be able to randomly \"bless\" people. One of these times, my dad randomly chose a table that, to my mom's mortification, was actually the very wealthy parents of one of her students. She begged my dad not to make it weird - these were rich people! They didn't need to \"be blessed\" and they certainly didn't need someone paying for their meal. My dad understood that they were...well...still human. And he paid for their meal anonymously. They eventually figured out it was my parents. A couple days later, the wife comes into my mom's classroom in absolute tears thanking her for the gesture. They'd had the week from hell in their personal lives and had gone out to eat at the only place still open at whatever late hour it was. And it was incredibly touching to them that somebody showed them act of spontaneous kindness. \n\nMy man, it isn't about the money. It's about the gesture - which, in this case, is a gesture you had every reason to believe would be rejected. I understand growing up in a very different world from her family and I understand that they in every literal sense don't need anything from you. Your GF probably should have asked you beforehand about the gesture to give you time to ponder it instead of putting you on the spot [in your own brain, anyway]. But take it as a learning moment - the test wasn't whether you had the money to pay or whether you technically should or shouldn't. The test was (1) whether you trusted your GF about both what would happen and the way it would be viewed, and (2) whether you had a heart full of grace or full of greed. You failed this one. You should consider a re-do on your terms in which you take them out to lunch.\n\nYTA for not understanding that sometimes the intent of the gesture is far more important than the act itself.", "Your gf offered to send you money for half the bill on the off chance her dad accepted your offer to pay so you would only be paying the amount you were willing to pay anyway. What's the problem? She's trying to make you look generous.\n\nAlso, you hardly paid anything for the trip so you could at least offer to cover one meal for everyone.\n\nShe's right and you are such an AH.\n\nOffering to cover the meal for everyone would have been a thoughtful gesture, which your gf understands and you do not. It seems like she can't even make you appear to be a thoughtful and generous person, which you are not. \n\nYTA. Big time.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been benefiting from their generosity for a year and you won\u2019t even **offer** to pay for one meal??? I get it\u2019s an expensive one but you saved that money 10 times over with all the freebies they\u2019ve given you.", ">but to expect me to offer to cover the entire bill is *obscured*.\n\nI think you mean absurd. Obscured means ambiguous or to make something dim or dark.\n\nAlso, YTA. If someone for paying for me all the damn time, I'd have the decency to try to pay at least some of the time, especially if I'm able to.", "YTA- I won\u2019t go into too much detail but right off the bat, the money you saved on your gf paying for half your ticket was more than enough to cover 2 brunches for everyone.", "YTA. You can also stop calling her your girlfriend because she is now your ex-girlfriend. She suggested something reasonable to do for her family after they've been so good to you and you laughed at the very thought.", "YTA.\nGiving off strong freeloader vibes here.", "YTA..... It's ok for her father to pay for you to go overseas and to have dinner out, but you can't even extend a tiny offer to cover brunch as a show of respect and gratitude?", ">I grew up very differently as I come from a family that was not financially well off. If someone offered to foot the bill, you'd just sit back and let them do it.\n\nYTA, and you need to overcome your scarcity mentality, all it does is get in your own way. Don't hide behind your upbringing to justify your actions and rhetoric as an adult.", "YTA\n\nYour GF\u2019s family has been really generous with you so far. Not everyone can return gestures on the same level, but after the wedding trip overseas, how can you be stingy over a $150 brunch? That\u2019s crazy! And to laugh at her for this suggestion is just rude and immature.\n\nHow your family handles splitting checks is irrelevant to the conversation because you are not with you family right now- you are with your GF\u2019s. And I can guarantee that this came up because someone (hopefully a sibling and not the bridal couple) noticed that you were pretty much handed a free vacation. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone had asked your GF about your etiquette or finances at some point, so rather than saying to you, \u201cmy brother thinks you\u2019re a greedy cheapskate,\u201d she floated the idea of you covering brunch.\n\nGood job being a complete boor.", "YTA I understand you had a different upbringing, but your gf's family has been extremely generous towards you and you should return the favor (unless you are flat broke). The fact that you laughed even at the suggestion was wrong and disrespectful. Perhaps it is time for you to leave your upbringing behind and grow as a person.", "Yta he paid for you for all those other things and the trip. All she was trying to do was make you look good!!!! Lmao.", "You're a freeloading asshole.\n\nAfter all he's given you, you can't even offer to pay for brunch, let alone actually do so?\n\nYTA and no wonder your gf has to reassess the relationship.", "So you enjoyed quite a lot money from your gf and her family and you wouldn't even PRETEND to offer to pay the bill for her family once and laughed at your gf for suggesting a thoughtful gesture that would make you look nice to her family? \n\nDo you even like her? Or just her money? You seriously sound like a gold digger and a pathetic loser. YTA.", "YTA , I feel sorry for your GF , if she asked you to offer to pay then someone in her family definitely brought up the fact that they're always taking you out and paying for you , all she's trying to do is make you look good infront of her father to defend your character.", "YTA, you wouldn't have covered the bill in the event that her dad didn't offer anyway as she was willing to stump up the remainder.\n\nWhat you've managed instead of saving money here is to make yourself look like a cheap AH to your girlfriend, but also an inconsiderate one.\nThe fact you have never offered to pay in all this time is bad enough, seeing how you describe the numerous occasions the bill has been covered for you.\n\nYou're lucky she's thinking about things tbh, she should  run.", "YTA  \n1. Her family in your words have been great to you  \n2. And they have indeed been VERY generous to you  \n3. You laughed at her suggestion  \n4. You think just offering to pay your portion is a good idea?  \n5. You should have trusted her  \n6. It was and always will be the right thing to do  \n7. I'm sure you just gave your ex a glimpse of the real you", "YTA she wanted you to not be seen as a leaching freeloader.", "YTA. I dated someone like you once. Past tense. They pay for you ALL THE TIME and you can\u2019t spring for one brunch? Yeah, definitely YTA.", "YTA. The fact that you have never offered to pay for a meal shared with them should be a huge red flag to your girlfriend, considering how often they've invited you. I can't believe she had to ask, let alone the fact you argued against it.", "So basically, your family was a bunch of freeloaders and they taught you it was okay to be one. YTA", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even have to PAY the other half of the bill. Your gf offered to do this. She just wanted you to look good. Then you messed that up and offered to pay half. \n\nThey\u2019ve bought you tons of dinner. It wasn\u2019t even her whole family. Just two people.", "YTA.  Actually, what you should do is step away and pay the server yourself, never giving her Dad a chance to object and pay the bill.  $150 is so very little for the generosity he has shown you. \n\nIf you feel that paying for these trips is some thing that\u2019s out of your budget, even for the portion that you\u2019re paying, then you\u2019re gonna have to let your girlfriend know you just can\u2019t afford to go along on these trips.", "YTA since they have been so generous with you it would be a nice gesture to cover a meal once. That is what an adult would do. Also, your gf is communicating to you somewhat subtly that it would make you look good in her father\u2019s eyes, which I\u2019m guessing you care about? If not, then continue to act like a child by just expecting to be taken care of by her dad until she dumps you for a mature guy with manners.", "YTA. It would be considerate on your part to offer to pick up a check now and then. You basically had it covered with either the dad picking up the check or your gf offering to pay half which would of been a win win for you. I think it was very selfish and inconsiderate of you to laugh it off and not offer. It's nice when someone offers even though the bill would be taken care of.", "YTA - you should apologize for laughing at her.", "YTA, I am embarrassed for you. Her father has covered way, way more than $150 for you. Offering to cover the bill is a gesture of appreciation and would be considered polite. The fact that your girlfriend actually SUGGESTED you cover it also makes me think that her family is starting to notice that you are happy to take but never give. Yikes.", "YTA your gf\u2019s dad had paid for you countless times. It is polite to offer to reciprocate and pay for their meal once in awhile. The fact that you are a taker and never a giver may doom your entire relationship.", "YTAH.  Not only that, you\u2019re a penny-pinching AH and one that can accept generosity, but can\u2019t give it.", "YTA, and a terrible cheapskate. After everything her family has done for you, the bare MINIMUM you could do is offer to cover a single meal out of the year and a half they've been treating you.\n\nYour girlfriend's family sound kind-spirited and generous, and I don't think you'll fit in very well at all.", "YTA. You sound really ungrateful. Should of listened to your girlfriend and took the opportunity to express some gratitude to her Dad, he\u2019s spent a fortune on you! A brunch is the least you could do", "Her family is throwing money at you left, right and centre and you're just lapping it up but you can't spring for brunch one time?\n\nYTA", "YTA this woman knows her father and tried to give you a leg up.  You responded by basically spitting in her face.  She should and will dump you.", "YTA - Also, has your family ever paid for her? Since you brought up the role reversal scenario with her.", "Your a mooch and a user. At least she's aware of how ungrateful and lacking in manners you are now. YTA.", "YTA It would have been a nice gesture to offer to pay after all he has done for you. It's a common courtesy and makes people feel like you appreciate them paying the full bill for you.", "Are you the girlfriend? Because I have a hard time believing that the BF posted this and made himself look as bad as possible with every new detail.", "YTA YTA YTA YTA  thousands times over and over. you are an embarrassment not only for your girlfriend, but for your parents as well. you are a shameless gold digger and definitely don't deserve her.", "YTA. It would have been $75 after a year and a half of them accommodating you. That\u2019s just sad, dude.", "Lmao enjoy this holiday with her bc there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll tolerate your true colours on another one", "You are the cheap-ass. I mean\u2026you\u2019re the A. YTA", "YTA The man treats you really nice. Indeed, I agree with you, it would be nice to reciprocate his kindness in someway, BUT not by offering to pay for you and your GF. I understand not being able to pay for the whole brunch, but that just seemed cheap.", "YTA. The lack of self-awareness is astonishing. You just want free ride because in your mind they can afford it so you are entitled to that. Newsflash you are not entitled to shit and I really hope she dumps you. You\u2019re an embarrassment. Obviously, you come across as a cheapskate and freeloader which is why she was asking you to make the gesture to save face. You really need to evaluate your interactions with others.", "YTA - Yes, her parents seem generous enough where they will always offer to pay but you can't go by your upbringing because then you'd never pay for anything with them. You should offer once in a while, even if they refuse. It's impoilte to just sit back and let them pay every time without offering. It does make you look greedy. Yes, offering to pay for you and your gf is nice, but her parents constantly pay for you so why not offer to pay for them? They paid for a hotel for you. They've paid for all of your meals, I assume, or most of them. It's not gonna hurt to start offering back once in a while, even if they're the types to not accept it. \n\nBecause, right now, it seems like you're taking advantage of their generosity (and you really are).", "Clueless. I predict space will turn into you being dumped because of your attitude. She\u2019s right to be turned off. You just ripped those rose tinted glasses off her face and stood on them, there is no getting them back on again. \n\nYou were being looked after by her family, and she was offering to share the cost of her father took you up on the offer, but your reaction was to laugh at her? Stingy, greedy and immature. Impressive in a bad way. YTA", "YTA 100%\n\nI am from an upbringing like your girlfriend. I guarantee is highly unlikely that her dad would ever accept money from you. It\u2019s literally just a courtesy to offer. Basically it gives recognition to her father that you would be willing to pay and you appreciate that he always pays.\n\nAlso, on the off chance that he accepts then just pay the bill. He\u2019s paid for entire overseas trips for you. Honestly, with all he does for you you should offer to take him his wife and your GF out for dinner and insist on paying.", "This is so embarrassing. You\u2019re perfectly happy to mooch off your gf\u2019s family but can\u2019t treat them out for a brunch as a thank you? Not even pretend?? Yikes. YTA and a sponge", "YTA. look this could happen just one time and it would be really nice and polite cause her parent have helped you many times. So even if her dad said yes it would be nice just for once. Im not saying more than once if you cant afford it. But think about it she even suggest to give you the half. She wanted only to say that to be polite..", "YTA. \n\nHer family - and her! - have clearly been very generous to you, and when your girlfriend asks you to make this one gesture (that she was going to reimburse you for, if it came to that!), you not only refuse but laugh in her face? \n\nIn many cases, marrying someone (or building a long-term partnership) means marrying their family too. And while your relationship with your partner/spouse takes priority, a lot of people look for in a partner someone who meshes well with their family culture and personalities. \n\nI suspect this was a test your girlfriend used to see how you'd fit in long-term, if you were able to offer generosity as easily as you are able to accept it. She even built in a fail-safe for you in terms of promising you that she'd cover half the bill, and yet, you still managed to fail. \n\nI don't blame her for needing to rethink things.", "The fact that she asked you might have been a subtle \"someone has noticed you never offer to pay so perhaps prove them wrong\" situation that you missed - her reaction to re-evaluate the relationship after this event adds to this suspicion. Whenever my in-laws come over from France and we meet up for a meal it\u2019s a \"fight to the death\" on who is going to pay. Sometimes they win, sometimes we win - all we know is we are all happy to pay for everyone and when we lose we cannot thank them enough.\n\nI say YTA for not taking the hint here (EDIT: and laughing/dismissing the offer to pay half if taken up on payment) - maybe get the next one to make up for this.", "YTA.", "Sometimes you need to give a little back to show appreciation\u2026..YTA", "YTA so her family have spent loads on you and you couldn't offer to pay for a brunch.  Maybe her family have concerns that you're using her and she suggested this to show you weren't, even offering to pay half in the unlikely event that they did accept your offer.", "Soft YTA, she was setting you up for success but you mistook her intentions. Sometimes you need to show a gesture of good will. It seems her family likes you enough to cover costs for you and you have no problem taking their monies. She even said she would cover the additional costs if her dad allowed you to pay. You had nothing to lose! If I were her I would be reevaluating the relationship.", "Dude you fucked up. Do you know how much that 150$ offer would have gotten you in favorability with her dad? You do understand, this would have led to an increase in fondness for you, and in the future, probably would have equaled much more free shit? Not saying that\u2019s how you should think about it, these are people not atms. But even coming from your Mindset or POV, that 150$ offer would have probably equaled, thousands of dollars worth of vacations, dinners, outings etc. \n\nNot to mention, from the humanistic point of view, which you seem to be lacking, it would show your appreciation for their kindness.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been cruises to the Bahamas, flights to Indonesia, dinner at five star restaurants. Now all you\u2019re gonna get is a break up. You fucked up.", "Lol. The working class way is definitely *not* \u201cif someone offered to foot the bill you\u2019d just sit back and let them do it\u201d. That is the cheap way. When someone is paying your way 90%, you absolutely offer to pay from time to time. And you don\u2019t do it hoping they won\u2019t let you, you do it hoping they will let you show your appreciation for what sounds like hundreds (maybe even thousands) they spent on you. YTA.", "Big-time AH", "YTA they have paid for you loads of times and you don\u2019t even consider buying them brunch", "YTA. It\u2019s called RECIPROCATING!", "YTA, absolutely and completely. Your gf wanted her father to see that you don't just take from him, you can be generous and caring too and you failed, majorly.\n\nYou sound so entitled and ridiculous to be frank.", "Where were you raised ? What kind of Man laugh to this... hope she wakes up and find a gentleman not a man who expect to be treated by his in law but never even propose to pay once.. what a shame.", "You are not God's gift to women, OP.  \n\nYTA.", "So...you're a mooch? I get it, your upbringings were different. But it sounds like they've been shelling out a lot for you. Even if you had to cover the $150 to buy some goodwill, wouldn't that have been a low price to pay? Sounds like you just lost a girlfriend and a good situation for a hundred bucks.\n\nEven then, when your partner tells you something, laughing at them is usually a bad look. Especially when what they tell you is reasonable.\n\nHard YTA.", "Yta and a bit of a mooch", "YTA. It sounds like they paid for you a lot, and you enjoy freebees now and then all the time. It is a common courtesy to return a favor. Otherwise you sound like you are mooching of her family, so I'd dump you immediately, tbh.", "Dude BIG time YTA \nBeyond that you should have been paying your own way in the first place but to not even offer and then laugh in her face? Wtf is your problem \nGrow up your lucky if she doesn't drop you l", "Jesus you're such a freeloader!! The amount of money her family have spent on you, and you won't even OFFER to pay for a single brunch?? That single act shows so much about your character. Your girlfriend clearly knew her father would foot the bill, but she gave you an opportunity to show respect, thanks and gratefulness to her family and you laughed in her face. She deserves better. She was obviously raised to be good, kind and respectful, which is much more than can be said about you. Offering to pay for your half of the bill is honestly more tacky and rude than saying nothing at all. Either offer to pay the bill, or don't. Don't go halfsies when they've been so generous to you. The absolute gall of you. I can't believe it.", "YTA sooo bad omg. One, $150 is not that much for everything they have done for you. That much every once in a long while is just a matter of being decent and respectful with how much they pay for you, if you ask me. If that were all, I\u2019d give an  E S H  because it still wouldn\u2019t be your girlfriend\u2019s place to tell you how to spend your money.\n\nBut YOU DIDNT ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY IT. I mean jeez, even if her dad let you pay, your girlfriend was gonna give it back to you! She just wanted you to look like a decent guy to her parents and you couldn\u2019t pay OR just play the part.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but you are the type of people I don\u2019t like, always easily accepting things but never wanting to reciprocate", "You\u2019re an idiot. And understand the image and gesture you\u2019re creating in front of her to her dad.\n\nThis was the easiest gesture.\n\nLiterally a layup bro.\n\nAnd you want to sit on the bench and laugh.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely the AH", "LITERALLY free brownie points with your gf's dad and you screwed it up, YTA", "Holy crap, you're a leech. YTA for refusing to pay for a $150 brunch when your GF's family has forked out thousands of dollars for you.

Offering to pick up the whole bill would absolutely have been the right thing to do, and your girlfriend was 100% correct. \n\nThink about it from her dad's point of view. He is probably happy to pay. But it would be irksome if the people he treats are starting to act like they take his generosity for granted. An offer to pay every now and then goes a long way to assuage this concern. I've been in this situation many times (on both sides), and you will almost always be refused. But it will be appreciated. Occasionally, the offer may actually be taken up, but it is still worth it, because this is a very strong sign that somebody *is* starting to pick up freeloader vibes from you.\n\nDefinitely YTA.

It is not your upbringing that is making you act this way. It is because you think your girlfriend\u2019s family is rich so why would you show some courtesy by paying this bill for the first time ? \n\nIn my family, even when some of us are facing difficult times financially, we still offer to pay the bill, because *it is common courtesy*.\n\nYou have been on the receiving end of a lot of kindness, taken on holidays etc. When you are asked, just once, to be the one to give, you are acting as if it is simply outrageous to even think you would pay for four people !", "YTA.

I grew up in poverty, but my dad won't let us kids pay for dinner, no matter how much we offer or how much we make. I'm the same with my kids. But it's nice to have them offer out of generosity. It sounds like you grew up in a situation where some of your family didn't ever contribute, so the rest pulled back and stopped offering. \n\n\n\nIt's ok to learn a new way to handle things.

My judgement is based off the fact you said you can't afford to pay. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. Playing courtesy games is an alien concept in my books. Just because they treat you nicely with money doesn't mean you have to reciprocate, if you cannot reciprocate.\nBut laughing at your gfs request is a bit of an asshole move, exactly because they treat you to a nice lifestyle.

It\u2019s your casual dismissal of her that makes YTA. \n\nIf you want a future with her, you\u2019re going to have to show her and her father that you are willing to foot the bill occasionally. And tbh, if you can afford a $150 brunch once in a blue moon, you absolutely should offer, and have the decency to insist, once in a while. Her father would never dream of having you pay the bill\u2026.. unless/until he figures out you are the mooch you come across as. \n\nKind people with money would never, ever expect someone with less to pay for their meal.

If you can pay your share you should always offer to be polite even if you know every single damn time they will reject your offer.

Her family is super sweet and I get along great with them.\n\nNow my gf's dad is pretty well off. Every time I've gone out to dinner with her family he always foots the bill. Her family has been great to me. They always welcome me in their house. I went to my gf's dads wedding with her in the fall overseas. Her parents paid for our hotel for the entire week, her dad gave her money for food (granted it was for her, her brother and myself), I also only paid for half of my flight because my gf offered to pay for the other half (around $350-400). The only thing I really had to pay for is food a couple of days out of the trip, which my gf pitched in and helped with too. \n\nThis past weekend my gf, myself, her younger brother, and her dad went out for brunch. I was spending the weekend with her anyway so she invited me to join them. Before we left her and I were talking and she mentioned how maybe I should offer to pay for brunch, as in for all 4 of us. She assured me that her dad would 1000% refuse to let me pay, but he would probably really appreciate and respect me for offering. \n\nNow here's where I may sound like an AH but I honestly laughed at her suggesting this. I told her I would offer to cover our (her and my) portion of the bill, but to expect me to offer to cover the entire bill is obscured. Sure, I work a full time job and all of that, but I have my own bills and stuff to worry about too, and she wants me to offer to pay for a $150ish brunch?!\n\nShe told me that if her dad accepted, which she could 100% guarantee that he wouldn't, that she would send me half for the bill. I continued to laugh and told her I'm not doing that, I'll offer to pay for our half and that's it. I asked her if the roles were reversed if she would offer to pay for the bill for my family? (8 of us in total including my gf), she said that's completely different. That's 8 people, not 4. \n\nWe both have VERY different upbringings, in terms of the situation I mentioned about paying the bill. She grew up with a decently well off family where they would constantly argue on who would pay the bill, because everyone in her family would always offer out of courtesy. I grew up very differently as I come from a family that was not financially well off. If someone offered to foot the bill, you'd just sit back and let them do it.  \n\nWhen we went to brunch I offered to cover both her and my portion of the bill, her dad immediately refused and covered the whole bill. She gave me a \"I told you so look\". She thinks I was an AH for how I reacted to the situation, and says I should've trusted her. She told me she needs some space because my reaction to the whole situation is kind of a turn off to her and she needs to think about thing's.

She is completely right about the situation, where he refused but was wrong in that you shouldn't offer expecting them refuse.. she did that trying to give you an out.\n\nI see your approach to it as greedy and selfish, they have clearly been generous to you and you act entitled. You should want to give them a gesture of good will and reciprocation, if she does give you another chance you better make it right and actually pay, if I were her I'd be expecting an apology from your sorry ass.\n\nStop rationalizing your bullshit, try to see past your bias.", "YTA. Full stop.\n\nPay for the freaking brunch, that 150 dollars is nothing compared to the thousands they covered for you, it shows that you give a fuck and you recognize that, although it can't be fair since they are well-off and you're just getting started in life, you're not just looking for handouts because they are wealthy. Except, that's exactly what you're doing. You've made it very clear that \"they're rich, so they should pay\".\n\nIf you ever want to have any respect at all from your father in law (and maybe you don't care, fair enough I guess), grow up and cover the bill from time to time. It sounds like you already get it back 10-fold. Give your head a shake, it's already a fantastic deal, and yet you can't buy them breakfast one day? Come on man.", "Damn you're cheap.

One that he would pay and two in the very unlikely scenario he didn't she would. \n\nThis sounds like a matter of principle rather than funds, How could you not trust her so much.

Low in the sense I was born on welfare, middle a in we eventually moved in a house but to this day you, 16 years later, it's still unfurnished and whatever furnishings are there are broken and 20+ years old. The only thing new is the TV. My partner on the other hand has a middle class family who are well off and pay for everything. We're trying to save for a home and they're letting us live here for free, and even though they refused every offer to pay rent or something we always try and help out when we can. I borrow mom's car and fill the tank, when I know mom is planning take out, I pick it up and buy it for her. For Christmas one year a well off uncle gave my partner $5000 USD as a pandemic gift, that's like almost $7000 CAD which we gave to them. While that's a nice chunk of change to help with moving, I'm sure the gesture is more important and I live free so it's not fair but the least we could do.

They always want to do things beyond your means, and your options are to decline and not get time together or accept and either go broke or rely on them and hope you don't appear to be a mooch. \n\nOffering (and occasionally actually) paying for your portion when you realistically can is a nice way to establish you are willing to contribute according to your means vs. intending to mooch. Especially if you want to be with this person long term, helping show her you aren't with her for the perks will go a long way. But respectfully offering what you could afford alone seems like a fantastic, non asshole solution. \n\nThe only reason I can see for y - t - a is that it went against her exact request, but I'd have a talk with her and explain that you respect her and her family too much to want to lie about how much you can afford (if that is in fact the case).", "NTA, you say you want to split the bill but her father always pays for it because he doesn't want to split it, nobody here knows how you are financially, you yourself say that they come from different backgrounds, she is more affluent and you are from a place of poverty, talk to your girlfriend and tell him you're not going to pay because you can't do it, what's more, if you didn't even want to, you wouldn't be the bad guy, you want to split the bill but he doesn't want to and he pays everything, you don't have to give money from where you don't have because your father's girlfriend does not want to split accounts", "NTA. Nothing more assholey than offering to pay for something you can't afford to follow through with, especially if it's just to \"look good\" as it says I see being a polite and good person as being able to pay for stuff.\n\nPeople who grew up with money will never understand that.", "Low hanging fruit to make yourself look good to her family (which of course she'd want) and you didn't bite. NTA because you were obviously scared and uncomfortable, but you missed a good opportunity!", "You meant \"absurd\" not \"obscured.\"\n\nYou want to be a direct person, and when you offer something you are prepared to give it.\n\nShe wants you to perform a social nicety that's common in her family.\n\nNTA, and she's only a slight one because she wouldn't accept your first no.", "NTA\nIf you can't afford it don't offer. If he had accepted and you couldn't pay it would have been way worse.\n\nDoesn't sound like you're asking for the help. Sounds like you have really nice in-laws and as long as you appreciate that, in the ways you can with I see no problems.", "NTA but not well-bred either. This could have gone a long way to make you look good in her and his eyes. Instead, now she knows you lack that specific social skillset which is valued in certain circles.", "NTA.\n\nIf she wouldn't make the offer for your family you shouldn't make the offer for hers.\n\nAlso, it's just common sense, don't make an offer to pay for something if you can't afford it, hoping that another party would turn you down.", "You are not married to her, and therefore your family is not her responsibility and vice versa.

She demands that you show her family you're the big guy who will put on the show of offering to pay for everyone even if it's a stretch for you.  Unfortunately this probably telegraphs a lot about how any future relationship would go in terms of her expectations of you stepping into the role her father plays - and her saying she needs space to think about it now and your not doing what she says is a turn off shows level of manipulation IMHO, and that is notable - and if you don't expect to take on that role for her of paying for everything like her dad does, and also to deal with this sort of emotional blackmail threat pattern, you should take the opportunity of her needing space to agree that it's time to exit.", "YTA.

You laughed at the expectation that once out of multiple times you might foot the bill. Yes, you grow up poor but that isn't the case now. I think she is right to reconsider the relationship because this attitude to financials is likely to influence other things - like spending beyond the bare essentials, acceptance by her family, her constantly having to apologise and field questions about your cheapness and how only with her for her Dad's money.  I acknoweledge the last probably isn't true but perceptions are important.", "10000000% YTA, especially for laughing. You just ruined your relationship pal.

It\u2019s still decent to try and cover the other bill, especially when the dad has been covering you financially for a lot of stuff.

She suggested it as a sign of respect towards her father because up to this point you\u2019ve had a FREE RIDE. And you laughed in her face?

Your gf and her family have literally spent 1000\u2019s of dollars on you and you actually laughed at the idea of spending $150 on them.

I.e., offer to go pick up dinner and have them, \u201coh, just give me your orders, I\u2019ll do it on my phone,\u201d and boom, I\u2019ve paid for it. It\u2019s once in a blue moon, but it\u2019s nice to pay it back. Obviously there are edge cases if you can\u2019t afford it, etc, but you should still offer to pay out of respect.

Moreover, the offer to pay for just you 2 further evidences your ingratitude.\n\nI can give you how, in the moment, your GF's suggestion to pay felt surprising.  I could even accept if you said that your laughter response came from nervousness.  Even a slight acknowledgement of your GF's point, and a request to do something later (like invite her parents to supper at your place another time).

This girl will soon be an ex, I predict, and her family will exit, too.\n\nTry to see these losses from a bigger picture.

I could almost guarantee that the father hasn't ever expected you to offer paying, and that he invites you because you're good company and you make his daughter happy (except for this situation, I guess). A well-off adult who has worked hard for their money will typically understand that it doesn't make sense to allow the young twenty-something pay for a pricey brunch - so she was correct in promising he wouldn't allow you to pay. In this situation, the appropriate thing to do is 1) explain to her that you understand the gesture, but that it's not something you could realistically do, so why offer under false pretenses? And 2) Come up with a way to show gratitude for the kindness they've shown you. This could be something as simple as pulling him aside, man-to-man, and expressing your gratefulness for his kindness and welcoming sense of family. \n\nYou were brought up on the other side of these situations, so it's understandable why you reacted the way you did.

You seem to be self righteous and a bit of a taker.   \n\nShe's thinking of a future with someone like that.

He can send nice thank you notes, help with clean up, be thoughtful, and things like that.

I'm guessing he's got the money and he's happy his daughter is in what is probably the longest and most stable relationship of her young life. He's smart enough to know that people in their early twenties were kids not that long ago, and aren't likely to have a ton of money to throw around. He's probably more than happy to have fun with his family and treat his kids and their partners to things. \n\nI'm guessing the girlfriend has been in the relationship long enough that she's starting to think about how he fits in to her life and to notice where there is friction in the native operating systems they each grew up with. She likes him and wants him to shine in the eyes of her family, so she's trying to coach him a bit, get him to do the things she thinks they'll like. Honestly, I kinda suspect the Dad can see through all of this, and knows OP can't afford the brunch, and probably either thinks his daughter put him up to this, or that OP is trying to flex a bit to impress the daughter. Either way, he probably likes it, in that it shows they care about what he thinks.", "Wiener.. ?", "> Are you sure he was going on this vacation if dad doesn't pay? I'm thinking he wouldn't go, and he only went because of the subsidy.\n\nThis is something we don't know, and probably won't know since OP doesn't seem like he's coming back to answer any questions. He still went, though, so it's still something he agreed to. It's still a lot of money he was able to save and still enjoy himself.\n\n> Where did you get this impression? The only thing he said was his family as not financially well off.\n\nHonestly, it was more my interpretation of what he said in the post. It seemed like he was more flippant about his financial situation, rather than concerned because he was broke. I guess I thought that he'd mention if he was broke, rather than saying he has \"bills...and stuff\" to worry about. Now, he grew up in a less financially stable situation as his gf, so it's very likely he just doesn't like throwing money around, and I totally get that. But I just don't like how he keeps saying he'll pay for him and his gf (which, fine, that's nice) without considering how her parents have helped him out too.\n\nI do think these two seem incompatible when it comes to finances, so I think this is something they can either compromise on or not. But, like, a year and a half and OP didn't seem to realize that offering to pay for her family would be a nice thing to do after they've paid for him plenty of times. For me, it sounds like he just doesn't WANT to, and that's the issue for me. GF is probably hinting to him that, \"hey, my parents paid for a lot of your stuff. Maybe return the favour\", and he's just not getting it.", "Not \"saved\" thousands of dollars. He would probably never have considered those travels or expensive restaurant dinners on his own.

It doesn't have to be equivalent on dollar value, but contributing in some way shows appreciation.", "Agreed.  If OP is going on vacation, etc., he should put some money aside so he can credibly offer to pay for a family meal out.\n\nTo do it right, he needs to INVITE the parents then INSIST that it is his treat because he is grateful to be included in the family.", "Exactly.

Being a gracious hostess, MIL had to get up and start cleaning.  SIL and her little sister couldn't let their mother do all the work so then they had to get up.

That they routinely lasted two hours but her rushing meant it ended in 35 minutes.  I asked why she didn't listen to me and she said she assumed I didn't know what I was talking about.  GRRRR.", "I guess some people just don't get it. You included. It's too bad as well. That father was never going to let OP pay. Someone that splurged on his family like that considers it a point of pride. Hell, some might be slightly offended if you offer to pay, but would appreciate the gesture anyways.\n\n\n\nSounds to me like you and OP aren't a good fit for a relationship like this. It's kind of sad because OP could have had a great life with this family, and now the girlfriend thinks way less of him than she does her father. Sorry, OP. You fucked up. YTA"]}
