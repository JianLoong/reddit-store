{"id": 25009, "submission_id": "15ve2da", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend I want to spend our date alone with her and not with her sister and nieces?", "selftext": "I (28f) have been with my girlfriend (28f) for over 6 years now and due to her mental health we haven\u2019t had a chance to go on a date in a very long time. I have invited her out multiple times but she always refuses which again I fully understand why. \n\nWe finally planned to go to my favourite park and have dinner afterwards and I was so excited to finally spend quality time with her. We live together and spend time together indoors but it isn\u2019t the same as going out on a date so I was really looking forward to it. \n\nShe decided to visit her sister and nieces yesterday and stay the night which I thought was lovely, they haven\u2019t seen each other in a while so it\u2019s not a problem. So this morning I get ready to have a shower as we planned to meet for lunch at the park, she checks in with me to make sure that everything is still good and then messages me to tell me that she invited her nieces and sister along as they would love to go to the park. I\u2019m a little confused as I thought this was a date, which I mention and she said that spending time with the girls would make the date even better for her. \n\nNow I do not have an issue with going to the park with them, honestly if this was just a random park trip I would have said bring them along anyway as that would have been nice but\u2026 this was supposed to be a date? \n\nSo I explained to her that I wanted to spend quality time with her today and I wished she asked me first before inviting anyone along. She got upset and starts saying that the girls will always come first and that she hasn\u2019t spent any quality time with them at all this week but has done so with me. In my eyes a date is very different to spending time alone at home. We had a little argument but I made it clear to her that my issue isn\u2019t the fact that we were going to spend time with the girls that day, I love spending time with them and her sister but that this was supposed to be a date. I said we could have just rescheduled the date and had a park outing with them today instead but she was telling me that I\u2019m selfish and that she can\u2019t believe how I can be such a terrible person. \n\nShe then said this word for word \u201cif we had planned a candlelight dinner by the beach or something, and they want to go they can. If you want to date me you should get used to them crashing our dates\u201d\n\nI have not yet replied to her message. I feel as though that it\u2019s important that it\u2019s just me and her otherwise it isn\u2019t a date and at the moment I don\u2019t feel special to her or valued as a partner and I should now go into every date with the expectation that she will bring someone along with her. \n\nShe has now cancelled as she showed her sister our messages and they said they don\u2019t want to go out now because of this mess. I spoke to my sister and she agrees with me that a date is between the couple, not family.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA when I said I wanted to spend our date with just her and not anyone else?", "created_utc": 1692445438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ve2da/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_want_to_spend/", "score": 685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her saying that no matter how romantic or private a date is, these children would be welcome to crash is really disrespectful to you and your relationship. This is not normal. She's not even saying if there was something urgent they would take priority; of course if she needed to cancel a date because the kids needed her then that's one thing, but saying that in any situation she'd rather spend time with these children than you makes me think she doesn't really value you as a romantic partner. \n\nThere should be enough time for her to spend some outings with her sister and their kids, but also to prioritize you and your relationship sometimes too. By refusing to do that, it feels like she's saying your relationship is unimportant to her.\n\nObviously this is a small snapshot of your relationship but it's definitely something that needs further thinking about and discussion.", "NTA it\u2019s a huge red flag that she doesn\u2019t respect you enough to spend quality one on one time together.

What you wanted is not an unreasonable request.\n\nI expect her mental health concerns are really more of a crutch to wave you off when she doesn't want to deal with you rather than an actual problem. Because if you actually had mental health concerns and a spouse that is thoughtful of them, you would try and develop strategies to not take that person's kindness for granted all the time.

I think it\u2019s extremely normal to expect a date to be focused on you and your partner, without the addition of random family members.

I won\u2019t go into detail about her issues as it is not my place to say.\n\nAs mentioned above she is currently going through DBT therapy which has been helping a lot hence why we were able to finally schedule a time for the date today. \n\nI do support her financially but she has also helped me out to many times as she does receive her own form of income, she even offered to pay for the dinner today so it definitely is not just one way, so I highly doubt she is just with me for money.\n\nNo she does not have kids of her own only her two nieces, f3 and f5.\n\nI will make a full update again once I have spoken to her properly, in the meantime I will do something for myself and do some gardening! \n\nOnce again thank you all for the support!", "They will ALWAYS come ahead of you? Well, you\u2019ve been told what type of a priority you are (not) to her", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d be very concerned with what she said about her nieces. That\u2019s super unusual honestly. \n\nEither she is looking for excuses not to be alone with you or she has a way over the top attachment to her family.", "NTA. Hubby and I have kids. We wouldn\u2019t even let them crash our dates, let alone nieces and nephews. Your (soon to be ex?) gf doesn\u2019t prioritize you for even a few hours. Probably time to move on.", "And are you expected to to pay for these extra people whom may crash your dates? Sounds like you need a new girlfriend.", "Your GF doesn\u2019t want to be with you anymore. Dragging people on dates is usually a sign of not wanting 1:1 time with your partner or spouse.\nBut she doesn\u2019t want to do the hard part of breaking up. She wants you to be the bad partner who was forcing her to choose between you and her sister. \nI\u2019m sorry OP.\nYou either accept 2nd place in her life or move on.", "Move on be happy with someone who values your time", "NTA. Like others have replied, it seems she's done, but she wants you to be the one who officially ends it, so she will keep disrespecting you and pushing you away until you do.", "Ur both assholes and it just sounds like your personalities collide and you both just need some vitamin D(eez nuts)", "Are her sister and nieces all >18 years old?

She basically told you that you will never be a priority. \n\nI low key expect her issues these past months and refusing dates is that she just no longer interest in you.\n\nNTA. You deserve someone who thinks you are the bees knees.", "NTA move on.", "Dude you\u2019re NTA and stuck between a rock and a hard place. You\u2019ve invested 6 years into this relationship and I\u2019m sure you love her. The problem is you are obviously not her first priority. You should have a long conversation with yourself about just that issue. For me it would probably be a deal breaker.", "NTA\n\nJust end it and move on\n\nIt just feels like she doesn't value you at this point", "OP, she\u2019s not really your girlfriend. She\u2019s more like, um, an \u2018enhanced acquaintance.\u2019\n\nShe literally doesn\u2019t want to date you. \n\nMight be time to consider a life that doesn\u2019t include her. You need much more than what she\u2019s willing to give.", "Are you sure you aren\u2019t just a friend?", "Wow! It doesn\u2019t sound like she wants to be alone with you.

Your gf has checked out of your relationship.", "NTA. This might be unpopular, but you are too young and healthy to tie yourself to someone with mental health issues. She seems to have plenty to deal with, and it's just not fair that you should suffer as well. This is not a relationship you want.

She\u2019s not on the same level as you are in in your relationship.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a relationship. She isn\u2019t treating you like a proper partner.

Let's be real here, if she's dating you, the only people who should have higher priority than you is her kids, which it seems she doesn't have. It's not normal to bring family on dates. If she wants to bring them on dates so much (forgive this for spunding gross, but this is how ridiculous she's being here) then she sound just date her sister then. Dump her. She clearly doesn't care or put anything into this relationship like you do and you can do better.", "NTA but you should really reconsider the relationship", "Nta\n\nI would end it. You been with her for six years and she still won't go on a date with you alone? Something is up and it probably won't get better.\n\nYou state she is having trouble mentally, but is she getting help? If not, I don't see this relationship going anywhere", "She told you that you don\u2019t come first.\nShe is obviously not interested.\nShe is honest to you.

Sorry.", "NTA and honestly it probably time for you to move on. She has shown you who she is, and where her priorities are. Yes she has mental health issues that could be why she so stuck on her sister and children but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be in a relationship with her to still support her. If you aren\u2019t getting the intimacy you need from her and have had the conversations with her, then it\u2019s best to move because if she hasn\u2019t changed in 6 years, do you really wanna waste 6 more?", "NTA, get out.

She apologized and told me she would ask to be seated further away or even just go to a different restaurant if we wanted. We didn\u2019t mind at all, but she was so apologetic since she didn\u2019t want to \u201ccrash\u201d our date.

The fact that she told you she didn\u2019t care if you planned a romantic candlelight dinner that if her family wanted to come they were going to come and that you just needed to get used to it and deal with it is incredibly disrespectful. There\u2019s nothing wrong with prioritizing family, but there should also be times you prioritize your partner and for her to have the attitude she has about it is a big red flag.  I\u2019m also not sure why she wouldn\u2019t want to just spend time out and go on nice dates with you.

Time to review what you want from life.", "Nta", "There are tons of people who choose not to date folks because they have kids. They wanna be the number priority in their relationship, and guess what! That's fine! You have the option to not live that lifestyle like so many other people and there is no point hating on people like that.\n\nShe is also free to prioritize her nieces! What a beautiful relationship , love that for her! she puts so much importance on family and people who are important to her! It can provide a lot of mental health benefits!\n\nYou gotta consider though... Y'all have been together 6 years. I doubt she has not crossed this boundary before. Unless you're ready to be #2 (or 3 or 4) and comfortable that  your resources will go to her sister, you gotta go. This is one of those \"does the rest of my life seem appealing if I do this?\"\n\nNTA", "NAH - \"She got upset and starts saying that the girls will always come first and that she hasn\u2019t spent any quality time with them at all this week\"\n\nYou have your answer. You are not a priority. How you deal with the situation it's up to you.", "Awww. How sad that you rate below everyone in her life! I agree that gf has checked out. You are not a priority at all. Time to move on. :(\n\nNTA", "NTA\nBut I agree with the others. She's wasting your time. Move on.", "OP, it sounds like your relationship has run its course. If she wants the kids around all the time and considers quality time just living together and you don't, that is an issue. \n\nI think at this point, leave it with no regrets. Tell girlfriend it's probably a good idea if she moves in with her sister and the kids and you'll look for a new roommate. \n\nYou owe it to yourself to find someone who will put you first and spend quality time with you. NTA", "Too much nonsense.\n\nNTA", " NTA, she told you that you will always be at best fourth in the pecking order, behind her sisters and nieces, if you are happy with that then you are in for a life of servitude.\n\nThis is one of the times when life is giving you a nudge to make a change, grasp it with both hands, tell your girlfriend that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s working out and move on.", "So MNY red flags OP. After 6 years you better be #1, not anyone in her family or it is tome to move on.", "100% NTA.", "NTA - Oh how hurtful! She told you that they come first and whatever they want will be more important than anything you may want at any time. You know where you stand and you will always be in that position of NOT being first in her estimations. You have some decisions to make here. You and your sister are correct that a \"DATE\" is what a couple does to bond.", "NTA It really sounds like she doesn\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth to do the work in a relationship right now and that\u2019s okay. What is not okay is how she\u2019s communicating that to you. You can\u2019t be a third wheel your relationship, have a honest conversation with her and tell her this. At the end of the day you can give yourself permission to move on if your needs are not being met.", "Yeah OP, she aint your girlfriend anymore, not much of a friend, and roommate.\n\nShe is purposely putting distance between you and her having time alone for a relationship.\n\nPlus sharing your personal messages is terrible.\n\nMove on.", "Nta.  \n But I\u2019m sorry this relationship sounds like it\u2019s over. She clearly said  \n you\u2019re not a priority and to never expect alone time.", "I would love an update.", "Nta. Honestly if you have your gfs sisters contact, I would message her and explain your side of it, that you love gfs family and love spending time with them, and you were more than happy to meet them at the park, and that you were just pointing out, your definition of date was a couple alone so it was no longer a date, more like a family outing, and that you were happy to reschedule your date for another time so you could have your family outing.", "Your girlfriend is avoiding private intimacy with you.", "Move on, and find someone who appreciates you, and puts you first. You are NTA, and you deserve so much better.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems she's avoiding dates or being alone with you. She created a situation where she knew you planned a date after a period of time where you guys weren't going out. \n\nShe's using her family as a barrier. That's unfair to them and you.\n\nThe relationship has ran it's course and she's avoiding leaving for whatever reason.", "Why, just why are you still with this woman?\n\nYou know what your future entails.\n\nJust, get out.", ">If you want to date me you should get used to them crashing our dates\n\nNTA, but there's an ultimatum if I ever saw one. Is that what you want, OP?", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate that after all this time ur learning u guys may not be compatible and may have been with each other out of comfort and convenience. As datea are a huge part of relationships. Whether if u want to have them and how should be agreed on for a healthy relationship\n\nIf you love her more than you value dates, and can live with this idea that you wont have quality alone time outside of living together, dont leave. \n\nBut pls do what makes you ultimately happy", "NTA  Nothing you do or say will be as important to her as her family. Do you want that for the rest of your life?", "Why are you still with her? She just told you clearly that she\u2019s bringing other people and if you are dating her, you\u2019re dating her and everyone else that she brings in her entourage if you don\u2019t like it and it find somebody else who you can have a date with on your own because she clearly told you what\u2019s up. If you don\u2019t accept what she told you then that\u2019s on you.", "It is time for your GF to move in with her sister and nieces and for you to move one.  You say her mental health issues have prevented her from going on dates with you, yet she is able to spend the night at her sister\u2019s without any issues.  Instead of spending one on one time with you *out in public*she wants to bring her family with her. Better public optics maybe? \n\nAfter 6 years why is she still using the term \u201cif you want to date me\u201d? Does she not consider 6 years make this a partnership, not just a dating relationship? \n\nYou don\u2019t mention what her mental health issues are, but from your narrative here, it seems they may be inflated to avoid spending time with you, ya\u2019 know, *in public*.  \n\nI am sorry. But I think for your mental health it is time to move on and find someone who values you and will put you first.", "Right??!!!\n\n\nI would love it if my hubs was like \n\nbaby its just you and me\n\nI want you and im gonna have ya\n\n\nBut it feels like this relationship has run its course and it sucks to break up with someone going through issues\n\n\n\nHowever if the issue is just dating and thats not happening, yeah, time to go\n\n\n\nStats say that parents usually pit kids first which okay i get that but sometimes doing that makes them forget each other when they need to findnways to be together still\n\n\nThose aint even her kids and shes given up on you and forgot you for them", "yep move on, GF clearly told OP what in her life is more important, ouch :-(", "Absolutely. It's about as clear an expression of priorities as you can receive. OP has apparently been her housemate for a while and has received no understanding in return for giving quite a lot.\n\nEven if she simply isn't comfortable going outside with OP, she clearly is with other people.", "Agreed! OP, NTA. \n\nAh, mate, I usually wouldn't rush to try to end a relationship, but you **are not** a priority to your gf. Imagine if you were to have kids, you'd probably slip even further down the order of people she loves and thinks are important. And then you'd have to ask yourself, do our children take precedence over her siblings and niblings? Nah. \n\nIt's time to get out, my lovely, and find someone who loves and values you the way you love and value them.", "It seems like OPs girlfriend only wants to go out on dates when her family is there with that info in mind I'm sure OP is the one paying for all of the dates. I personally wouldn't try to spend the rest of my life with someone who refuses to spend any alone time with me. NTA", "Was coming here to say this. She doesn't even want to spend time with her, what's the point\n\nAnd personally, if I were the sister I wouldn't have come to someone else's private date if I was paid to\n\nLike seriously your sister says she has a date with her boyfriend and you say \"yay, my girls love the park!\"\n\nYikes\n\nEdit: a word + wrong pronoun", "Yeah. He's being strung along for some weird reason we aren't getting.\n\nOP it's time to look out for your mental health.", "Sometimes you just have to see it all written down.  Having a conversation over IM was the killer of my first 6year relationship where my ex basically kept saying I make her depressed in different ways.", "I agree, and I\u2019ll add that if the GF has mental health problems and she\u2019s not in therapy dealing with them, that\u2019s also a dealbreaker as her issues are clearly affecting her relationship with others.", "Every single story on this sub ends with the other person snapping at op and calling them names or their family members texting them the same, which has led me to believe these formulaic stories are fake karma farms.", "the ice cream,never having a party don't get you a nice present they paid for your college you graduated in what.they are horrible by the highest standards.", "Your disgusting", "That is exactly what I was thinking. OP is NTA.", "[removed]", "Agreed. She and gf are basically just friends at this point. She already mentioned that gf kept turning down dates. They are definitely no longer on the same page.", "Sounds like she's checked out of the relationship and just hasn't wanted to end it on her own.", "Reading this comment was really weird because the spacing made me think you were quoting song lyrics, but then the song got weird lol", "I need the story", "Can you present any data on this assessment?\n\nEdit: dear god, you all missed the joke, ya derps. \ud83d\ude0b", "And are we glossing over the fact that the gf showed her sister the texts? Like excuse me, I was having a private disagreement with my partner. Way to put me on blast.", "No, they are not friends. The gf is completely disrespectful to OP. She doesn't care about OP in any meaningful way.", "[removed]", "Lesbian bed death", "Bad bot.", "It's not their fault they're a child and they didn't get your point hahaha. The number of smartass kids who literally answer is insane", "r/reddit", "Welcome to reddit", "They aren't taking into account that while women are half the population, only a fraction of that is queer, and of that fraction people can still suck.", "The OOP was being hyperbolic but it probably is a lowball estimate.\n\n.001 billion is 1 million. For reference (not saying OOOP\u2019s partner is a psychopath), but a lowball estimate of female psychopaths in the US alone is .5 million. Not saying that only psychopaths do this sort of this by nor am I saying psychopaths always do this sort of thing. Just a frame of reference.\n\nEdit: Math", "This is what got me!  Immediately involving the sister in what should have been a private discussion.", "The more I read, the more I thought: wtf did I just read. This is abhorrent behavior from a partner. And her family. \n\nBut if the family doesn't find anything wrong with it and its also offended, you can see where it came from. And you can see that she will always have people who validate this nonsense. \n\nShe'll never hear you or see your point. \n\nTime to let go. You've been kind and patient with her mental health. She can't give you basic respect.", "You are forgetting:\n\nFemales who are too young or too old\n\nFemales already in a (happy) relationship\n\nFemales with incompatible sexual orientation\n\nAromantic (or asexual, if that is a word) women\n\nPeople with medical and mental health conditions that you may not be ok with", "I didn't see where her family didn't see anything wrong with it.  I read that the sister didn't want to go because of the \"mess.\"  Maybe I'm giving sis too much credit, but it sounds to me like she didn't know it was supposed to be a date and backed out when she realized.  She could be normal.\n\nBut I completely agree that it's time for OP to move on."]}
