{"id": 25009, "submission_id": "15ve2da", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend I want to spend our date alone with her and not with her sister and nieces?", "selftext": "I (28f) have been with my girlfriend (28f) for over 6 years now and due to her mental health we haven\u2019t had a chance to go on a date in a very long time. I have invited her out multiple times but she always refuses which again I fully understand why. \n\nWe finally planned to go to my favourite park and have dinner afterwards and I was so excited to finally spend quality time with her. We live together and spend time together indoors but it isn\u2019t the same as going out on a date so I was really looking forward to it. \n\nShe decided to visit her sister and nieces yesterday and stay the night which I thought was lovely, they haven\u2019t seen each other in a while so it\u2019s not a problem. So this morning I get ready to have a shower as we planned to meet for lunch at the park, she checks in with me to make sure that everything is still good and then messages me to tell me that she invited her nieces and sister along as they would love to go to the park. I\u2019m a little confused as I thought this was a date, which I mention and she said that spending time with the girls would make the date even better for her. \n\nNow I do not have an issue with going to the park with them, honestly if this was just a random park trip I would have said bring them along anyway as that would have been nice but\u2026 this was supposed to be a date? \n\nSo I explained to her that I wanted to spend quality time with her today and I wished she asked me first before inviting anyone along. She got upset and starts saying that the girls will always come first and that she hasn\u2019t spent any quality time with them at all this week but has done so with me. In my eyes a date is very different to spending time alone at home. We had a little argument but I made it clear to her that my issue isn\u2019t the fact that we were going to spend time with the girls that day, I love spending time with them and her sister but that this was supposed to be a date. I said we could have just rescheduled the date and had a park outing with them today instead but she was telling me that I\u2019m selfish and that she can\u2019t believe how I can be such a terrible person. \n\nShe then said this word for word \u201cif we had planned a candlelight dinner by the beach or something, and they want to go they can. If you want to date me you should get used to them crashing our dates\u201d\n\nI have not yet replied to her message. I feel as though that it\u2019s important that it\u2019s just me and her otherwise it isn\u2019t a date and at the moment I don\u2019t feel special to her or valued as a partner and I should now go into every date with the expectation that she will bring someone along with her. \n\nShe has now cancelled as she showed her sister our messages and they said they don\u2019t want to go out now because of this mess. I spoke to my sister and she agrees with me that a date is between the couple, not family.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA when I said I wanted to spend our date with just her and not anyone else?", "created_utc": 1692445438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ve2da/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_want_to_spend/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her saying that no matter how romantic or private a date is, these children would be welcome to crash is really disrespectful to you and your relationship. This is not normal. She's not even saying if there was something urgent they would take priority; of course if she needed to cancel a date because the kids needed her then that's one thing, but saying that in any situation she'd rather spend time with these children than you makes me think she doesn't really value you as a romantic partner. \n\nThere should be enough time for her to spend some outings with her sister and their kids, but also to prioritize you and your relationship sometimes too. By refusing to do that, it feels like she's saying your relationship is unimportant to her.\n\nObviously this is a small snapshot of your relationship but it's definitely something that needs further thinking about and discussion.", "NTA it\u2019s a huge red flag that she doesn\u2019t respect you enough to spend quality one on one time together.

What you wanted is not an unreasonable request.\n\nI expect her mental health concerns are really more of a crutch to wave you off when she doesn't want to deal with you rather than an actual problem. Because if you actually had mental health concerns and a spouse that is thoughtful of them, you would try and develop strategies to not take that person's kindness for granted all the time. She gives those of us with actual mental health issues that put in the work a bad name.\n\nNTA, reconsider this relationship.

And also I will say honestly that her sister and nieces being a priority is not exactly ok. You build your life with your partner and he becomes your family.

Have you two discussed where your feelings for each other are? Going months between dates before kids seems absurd to me.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s extremely normal to expect a date to be focused on you and your partner, without the addition of random family members.

It\u2019d be one thing if she wanted to alter the plans (\u2018Hey, let\u2019s take the girls with us, and reschedule our date\u2019), but it\u2019s downright weird that she\u2019s saying that *any* date is open to having her nieces gatecrash.", "NTA but you have a roommate with benefits, not a girlfriend, Hon.", "NTA\n\nBut she has.told you where she stands\n\"If you want to date me you should get used to them crashing our dates\u201d\n\nSo its up to you.  \n\nShe honestly doesn't seem that into you.  \n\nMost women who are really into their BFs WANT to spend alone time with them, more than they want family members tagging along.
