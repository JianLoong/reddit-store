{"id": 25009, "submission_id": "15ve2da", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend I want to spend our date alone with her and not with her sister and nieces?", "selftext": "I (28f) have been with my girlfriend (28f) for over 6 years now and due to her mental health we haven\u2019t had a chance to go on a date in a very long time. I have invited her out multiple times but she always refuses which again I fully understand why. \n\nWe finally planned to go to my favourite park and have dinner afterwards (which she offered to pay for) and I was so excited to finally spend quality time with her. We live together and spend time together indoors but it isn\u2019t the same as going out on a date so I was really looking forward to it. \n\nShe decided to visit her sister and nieces yesterday and stay the night which I thought was lovely, they haven\u2019t seen each other in a while so it\u2019s not a problem. So this morning I get ready to have a shower as we planned to meet for lunch at the park, she checks in with me to make sure that everything is still good and then messages me to tell me that she invited her nieces and sister along as they would love to go to the park. I\u2019m a little confused as I thought this was a date, which I mention and she said that spending time with the girls would make the date even better for her. \n\nNow I do not have an issue with going to the park with them, honestly if this was just a random park trip I would have said bring them along anyway as that would have been nice but\u2026 this was supposed to be a date? \n\nSo I explained to her that I wanted to spend quality time with her today and I wished she asked me first before inviting anyone along. She got upset and starts saying that the girls will always come first and that she hasn\u2019t spent any quality time with them at all this week but has done so with me. In my eyes a date is very different to spending time alone at home. We had a little argument but I made it clear to her that my issue isn\u2019t the fact that we were going to spend time with the girls that day, I love spending time with them and her sister but that this was supposed to be a date. I said we could have just rescheduled the date and had a park outing with them today instead but she was telling me that I\u2019m selfish and that she can\u2019t believe how I can be such a terrible person. \n\nShe then said this word for word \u201cif we had planned a candlelight dinner by the beach or something, and they want to go they can. If you want to date me you should get used to them crashing our dates\u201d\n\nI have not yet replied to her message. I feel as though that it\u2019s important that it\u2019s just me and her otherwise it isn\u2019t a date and at the moment I don\u2019t feel special to her or valued as a partner and I should now go into every date with the expectation that she will bring someone along with her. \n\nShe has now cancelled as she showed her sister our messages and they said they don\u2019t want to go out now because of this mess. I spoke to my sister and she agrees with me that a date is between the couple, not family.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA when I said I wanted to spend our date with just her and not anyone else?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the support!

Her saying that no matter how romantic or private a date is, these children would be welcome to crash is really disrespectful to you and your relationship. This is not normal. She's not even saying if there was something urgent they would take priority; of course if she needed to cancel a date because the kids needed her then that's one thing, but saying that in any situation she'd rather spend time with these children than you makes me think she doesn't really value you as a romantic partner. \n\nThere should be enough time for her to spend some outings with her sister and their kids, but also to prioritize you and your relationship sometimes too.

What you wanted is not an unreasonable request.\n\nI expect her mental health concerns are really more of a crutch to wave you off when she doesn't want to deal with you rather than an actual problem. Because if you actually had mental health concerns and a spouse that is thoughtful of them, you would try and develop strategies to not take that person's kindness for granted all the time.

I think it\u2019s extremely normal to expect a date to be focused on you and your partner, without the addition of random family members.

I won\u2019t go into detail about her issues as it is not my place to say.\n\nAs mentioned above she is currently going through DBT therapy which has been helping a lot hence why we were able to finally schedule a time for the date today. \n\nI do support her financially but she has also helped me out to many times as she does receive her own form of income, she even offered to pay for the dinner today so it definitely is not just one way, so I highly doubt she is just with me for money.\n\nNo she does not have kids of her own only her two nieces, f3 and f5.\n\nI will make a full update again once I have spoken to her properly, in the meantime I will do something for myself and do some gardening! \n\nOnce again thank you all for the support!", "They will ALWAYS come ahead of you? Well, you\u2019ve been told what type of a priority you are (not) to her", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d be very concerned with what she said about her nieces.

We wouldn\u2019t even let them crash our dates, let alone nieces and nephews. Your (soon to be ex?) gf doesn\u2019t prioritize you for even a few hours.

Sounds like you need a new girlfriend.", "Your GF doesn\u2019t want to be with you anymore. Dragging people on dates is usually a sign of not wanting 1:1 time with your partner or spouse.\nBut she doesn\u2019t want to do the hard part of breaking up. She wants you to be the bad partner who was forcing her to choose between you and her sister. \nI\u2019m sorry OP.\nYou either accept 2nd place in her life or move on.", "Move on be happy with someone who values your time", "NTA. Like others have replied, it seems she's done, but she wants you to be the one who officially ends it, so she will keep disrespecting you and pushing you away until you do.", "Ur both assholes and it just sounds like your personalities collide and you both just need some vitamin D(eez nuts)", "Are her sister and nieces all >18 years old?

She basically told you that you will never be a priority. \n\nI low key expect her issues these past months and refusing dates is that she just no longer interest in you.\n\nNTA. You deserve someone who thinks you are the bees knees.", "NTA move on.", "Dude you\u2019re NTA and stuck between a rock and a hard place. You\u2019ve invested 6 years into this relationship and I\u2019m sure you love her. The problem is you are obviously not her first priority. You should have a long conversation with yourself about just that issue. For me it would probably be a deal breaker.", "NTA\n\nJust end it and move on\n\nIt just feels like she doesn't value you at this point", "OP, she\u2019s not really your girlfriend. She\u2019s more like, um, an \u2018enhanced acquaintance.\u2019\n\nShe literally doesn\u2019t want to date you. \n\nMight be time to consider a life that doesn\u2019t include her.

Your gf has checked out of your relationship.", "NTA. This might be unpopular, but you are too young and healthy to tie yourself to someone with mental health issues.

Let's be real here, if she's dating you, the only people who should have higher priority than you is her kids, which it seems she doesn't have. It's not normal to bring family on dates. If she wants to bring them on dates so much (forgive this for spunding gross, but this is how ridiculous she's being here) then she sound just date her sister then. Dump her. She clearly doesn't care or put anything into this relationship like you do and you can do better.", "NTA but you should really reconsider the relationship", "Nta\n\nI would end it. You been with her for six years and she still won't go on a date with you alone?

If not, I don't see this relationship going anywhere", "She told you that you don\u2019t come first.\nShe is obviously not interested.\nShe is honest to you.

Sorry.", "NTA and honestly it probably time for you to move on. She has shown you who she is, and where her priorities are. Yes she has mental health issues that could be why she so stuck on her sister and children but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be in a relationship with her to still support her. If you aren\u2019t getting the intimacy you need from her and have had the conversations with her, then it\u2019s best to move because if she hasn\u2019t changed in 6 years, do you really wanna waste 6 more?", "NTA, get out.

The fact that she told you she didn\u2019t care if you planned a romantic candlelight dinner that if her family wanted to come they were going to come and that you just needed to get used to it and deal with it is incredibly disrespectful.

HOWEVER, she is putting them ahead of you without further consideration! Now, she\u2019s angry and has started saying things that are both provocative and don\u2019t make sense. Before I read your entire post I thought easy-peasy, just make it two events back-to-back; park as a group and dinner in private.

After things cool down, you should have a serious conversation with her so she knows VERY CLEARLY how you feel and is in a state of mind where she can process it more maturely (at least your conscience will be clear). I also suggest you have a conversation with her sister so she holds no I\u2019ll will toward you and she may be able to help? If you try everything to make some sort of compromise without success, as much as I hate to say it, continuing the relationship under these conditions is not healthy and you need to seriously reassess whether to continue on with her. \n\nI really hate to ever broach the possibility of ending a relationship, as they can be so fulfilling and there may be so many other redeeming traits. Here, we are analyzing a single event, however, based on what she\u2019s said, it has broadened WAY beyond this one event. \n\nIf you value the relationship you should try to see a counselor together.

He was working an absolutely horrible job and I was in my senior year of college.  We typically saw each other an hour a day after he got off work.  The problem was that hour was past the time time I typically went to bed and was after the dorms were closed to visitors.  So we spent the hour with me being tired and probably irritable in the very public dorm common room.  It was no where near the quality time that I craved.  He finally got a day off - his first day off in over a month.  I assumed he would want to spend that time with me and planned a picnic date.  He had other plans.  He was/is very close to his parents.  He had not seen them at all for over a month so he wanted to drive out of town to spend time with them.  He saw me regularly, but didn\u2019t see them at all so he felt he should prioritize them.  I was invited, but seriously, still not the quality time I needed.  I told him that I needed him and he told me that he needed to see his parents.  Ouch. Plus, he wanted to be out of town so they couldn\u2019t call him into work (that one was reasonable, but he could also just not answer the phone).  In the end, he went to his parents\u2019 house and I stayed home and stewed.  We were both mad that the other didn\u2019t understand.\n\nWhen he came home we talked.  I understood his perspective better and he mine.  He worked to prioritize my needs better and I worked to understand his relationship with his parents more.  In the end, I\u2019m very grateful we worked through it.\n\nOn a different note, at the time we had never heard of love languages.  In retrospect, this was likely part of our problem.  My love language is quality time.  His is gifts.

If she says those things to you directly, I can only imagine how she talks about you when you aren't around. \n\nI am somewhat in your GFs position, but it is physical medical issues that cause me to not be about to leave the house much. I would never priotize anyone over my partner, because he is the one who is there for me day in and day out, and supports me in ways I never thought were possible to have from another person. Your GF not only isn't grateful for you doing the same for her, she highly takes you for granted and is being extremely disrespectful, toxic, and gaslighting you. She also proved that you cannot trust her because she showed her sister your messages and what not. If this is how she treats you when she is doing good in her treatment, I hate to know how she treats you when she isn't. \n\nA long term healthy and happy relationship is built on three main pillars: trust, respect, and communication. You GF has proved you two have none of those, even after 6 years together. You really need to step back and think about if this is how you want to be treated for the rest of your life... Because it's not getting any better. \n\nI think you also need to realize that you can not expect someone to truly respect and love you, if you don't respect and love yourself first. Whether you decide to stay with her or not, I highly suggest you get into therapy if you aren't already. I feel like you may be letting her treat you this way, because either you feel like you can't do better, or if you stay with her through all of this and help her get better than she will love you forever, and truly learn to value you for all you did for her. I am sorry to tell you, but this won't end well if either of those are the case. \n\nI am only talking from experience. I had a few long term relationships with people who shouldn't have been in relationships period, because they had issues and things that they really should have fully worked through first. But I thought if I was there for them, helped them through them, and made all their hopes and dream come true to the point that they had a significantly better life with me than would have ever been possible without me, that they would love me forever and never leave me. But in the process, I completely lost sight of myself and anything I wanted out of life or the dreams I had. And they still were extremely abusive, toxic, and usually ended up cheating on me as well. Not saying she will cheat, but the abusive and toxic behaviors will never change. And any major changes she needs to do for herself, she has to choose to do on her own for herself... period. Because if she says she will change for you, but doesn't really do the real work to make those changes, they will always just be words she says to try to keep you around. So in the future, find someone who doesn't need to make changes to be the person you truly deserve.", "I\u2019m glad she\u2019s getting help!

Personally I wouldn't marry into this situation, so if you feel like you've come to an impasse in your relationship, it might be best for you two to separate.\n\nJust whatever you do, don't feel guilty and don't let her try to guilt you into thinking you're the problem with your VERY REASONABLE REQUEST. Show her this post if you have to. You sound like a great, empathetic person, but once you're no longer a priority as a partner - which is important in order for you to move forward together - sounds like she's just depending on you for the benefits of having a partner but not willing to treat you like one, and that's not fair to you.", "Bro gtfo please", "Honestly I think you got friendzoned.  You are not \u2018really\u2019 in a bf/gf relationship with her anymore and just roommates.  Proceed if you are ok with that. And change it if not", "Is it wrong?\nThere is 8 billion people in this world. Is it so egregiously wrong to assume roughly 4 billion of them are women?", "A roommate who pays for her smh", "Like she thinks of him/treats him like a roommate she can exploit for free caretaking.", "\ud83e\udd23 for the record im straight male. Just wanted to save them from hate if a radical seen it", "I doubt that it was YOU were making her depressed, as in there was nothing you were doing that was causing depression. It was probably that she realized you two weren't going to work out long-term and she was really struggling with ending it. Y'all had been together for so long and you had done nothing wrong, so she was struggling with her feelings and didn't want to hurt you. So that was the cause of her depression. Not sure if that makes it better? But I wouldn't interpret as YOU made her depressed, or that it's some character flaw you have.", "The family does though. That's why the sister cancelled once she understood it was date crashing and told OP they were right.", "My guess is that everything he texts her is automatically shared, at least he should consider it as being shared...", "Asexual is a word, but romance and sexuality aren\u2019t dependent on each other afaik, so asexual women can still be homoromantic aka lesbians and want to spend time with SO on dates, so yeah writing aromantic is enough, there\u2019s no \u201cor\u201d", "If god is this bigoted then when I die, if there\u2019s a heaven and hell, I\u2019d rather go downstairs and party hard with lucifer than go upstairs with all the uptight, religious nutjobs", "The comment the girlfriend made that they could have a candlelight dinner and she would let her family crash it, and that OP should be ok with family crashing any date.", "If you put it in writing, odds are it will be shown to other people.", "Correct. I'm a panromantic ace woman who's been happily married for 5 years :)", "We don't think op is a saint. We think making a date and then having your girlfriend bring in her nieces is not a great idea. Not everyone wants to spend time with some kids. Gf can spend time with them without ruining a potential date with her partner.", "Just noting that OP is also female.", "There\u2019s no men in this post so who are you referring to the OP or her gf\u2019s sister?", "NTA. \n\nShe flat out told you that two young children that are not in her care are a higher priority than you and any and all plans you may have must include them.\n\nAnd this is after \"a very long time\" of no dates.\n\nNow is the time to end this.", "NTA. But consider, if you do decide to marry and have kids, where you will be on her list of priorities.", "NTA - just say to her bye, bye!", "NTA and she showed the sister so you will always be the jerk in her eyes and she is going to think you don\u2019t like her and/or her kids. Feels like to me your the only one committed to this relationship.", "NTA. A date is between the people involved in the relationship only. She told you where you stand so I would believe her. Her sister\u2019s kids will always come first. They are her priority not you. Now you need to decide whether or not you are happy playing second fiddle to her nieces. If not, move on and find someone who will treat you with respect.", "Time to move on.", "NTA. You will be the AH if you stay with this \"girlfriend\" who has shown you who she is.", "NtA. Dump her, you can do better.", "Your girlfriend is avoiding your romantic intentions. For whatever reason she doesn\u2019t want to be romantic with you. Inviting her sisters to the park didn\u2019t work to avoid the romance but that\u2019s ok because she picked a fight with you and voila does not have to go on a romantic date with you.\n\nDo you want to be in a relationship with someone who actively avoids being romantic with you? I have a feeling that you deserve better.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm voting because I want to make sure you realize you're not the a-hole and it seems like your girlfriend doesn't see you as a priority in her life.\n\nI suggest you return the sentiment.", "Dump and run. FFS.", "NTA. She is pushing you out, hoping you'll be the one to end it.id give her what she wants.", "NAH\n\n>\u201cif we had planned a candlelight dinner by the beach or something, and they want to go they can. If you want to date me you should get used to them crashing our dates\u201d\n\n...If you have sex, or any other similar adjacent private activity together, should they crash your bedroom too? \n\napologies if it sounds crude. But come on. Needing to relay on family is fine, but it's called a DATE for a reason.", "Her sister and nieces will always come first? Come on...they're not even her kids. So NTA.", "This!", "Its hard to say for sure without more details of her condition, but it  sounds like she had cold feet about this date and invited the others along because she felt it would provoke you and give her justification for cancelling.  That way its your fault, not hers, but she still gets what she wanted.\n\nThat's not to say its OK for her to do that to you.  Its just that when someone is insecure, they will often say really stupid, nonsensical things to defend their actions because they can't just come out and say \"I am too scared\" or \"I'm selfish.\"   No one deserves to be on the other end of that kind of insecurity.   You should not be made to feel responsible for her feelings, especially if she's not honest about them.", "Sounds like she's already doing that.", "Or she\u2019s just avoiding romantic situations. This sounds like some shit I pulled in high school when I wanted to dump a guy but didn\u2019t want to be the dumper. I wanted him to lose interest and dump me and move on. Then I didn\u2019t have to feel guilty about hurting him.", "Absolutely! Definitely NTA. that\u2019s not putting them first but f there\u2019s an an event they were having. But not prioritizing extended family over your partner of 6 years is an issue \ud83d\udea9 . Not talking to you ahead of making an executive decision, is another \ud83d\udea9. \n\nShe\u2019s not that into you. \nSorry babe, good luck.", ">Kids at that age are so much fun to hang out with.\n\nNo, they're really not. Maybe for 5 minutes before giving them back to their parents. But they're definitely not better than to have a romantic date (or anything else).", "\\*her. they're both women.", "This should be top comment.", "Op is a woman.", "Yeah we weren\u2019t compatible.  She is a great person but I\u2019m incredibly direct and she is a people pleaser.  She was incredibly family centric and I\u2019m more independent.", "Women. Not females.", "In the entire world population of female gender, we have a good number of infants, toddler, kids, teens etc. In that case is Women a better term than females?", "Point taken. I need to stop seeing everything as \u201cfeeeeemales.\u201d Apologies friend, you\u2019re absolutely right.", "This could be it. GF might not have told sister it was a date. GF might have just told her \"hey, me and OP are going to the park. Maybe nieces would like it too! You guys should join us!\" and when GF showed her sister the texts, sister realised she was interfering with a romantic date and told GF she wouldn't come anymore.\n\nAlso, GF not wanting to spend time with OP outside the household is a red flag to me. It's like GF doesn't want to actually break it of with OP, but also doesn't want to be seen alone with her partner in public. Is it because GF has her priorities mixed up? Or is something else going on?\n\nAnyway, when your SO doesn't get it that you also need couple's time outside the household, it might be time things need to change (not necessarily saying break up, but it will end that way if GF doesn't change her ways, soon).", "That comment \"doesn't want to be seen alone with her partner in public\"...something I didn't pick up on that can bring a whole new landmine of theories.  Can't wait to see where this goes!", "NTA. If my partner told me \"my nieces will always come first\" we'd be done. \"My kids will always come first\", yes of course. Not nieces.", "NTA\n\nYou made plans ahead of time and specified that you wanted a date, as in you and her. She is being dismissive and let you know she will bring whoever she wants whenever she wants regardless of how you feel. That is not how a loving partner should treat you. You don't have to put up with someone crashing your dates.", "You can't be surprised by this lol.", "I was quite uncomfortable by this to be honest and apparently her sister doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with anything my girlfriend said and agrees that the girls should be the priority. I don\u2019t know exactly what she said but I had a quick talk with my girlfriend, which unfortunately didn\u2019t really go anywhere but we plan to talk again in the morning so hopefully I\u2019ll have a full update by then, and she said her sister went full mama-bear mode despite the fact I mentioned multiple times the issue isn\u2019t spending time with the girls which they both seem hung up on. \n\nBut to be honest she has always been quite\u2026 aggressive I guess I can describe it in her love for her daughters. For example, my girlfriend and I both caught covid around Halloween last year, we planned a small kids party as the girls love Halloween and dressing up but obviously we had to cancel it and she got upset and said we have disappointed her daughters who were looking forward to a party. We offered to just postpone it but she said it\u2019s too late and she will just have to do something else with them so they still have a good Halloween.\n\nI remember we visited them a month after and out loud she said that Sarah (fake name, the oldest daughter) asked why they didn\u2019t have a kids party for Halloween and was sad about it. Almost immediately Sarah looked at her confused and said \u201cI didn\u2019t say that\u201d. I tried very hard not to smile and laugh at that. Of course she didn\u2019t say anything after that because she was caught out."]}
