She obviously is not a responsible horse owner or instructor and can\u2019t be trusted to keep children safe. One of my close friends was asked to testify as an expert witness in a case where an instructor had been asked to teach a kid at someone else\u2019s farm on a horse owned by the farm owner. The equipment was not safe, the girth turned out to be too loose and right at the beginning of the lesson, the saddle slipped to the side. The stirrup was too large for the boy\u2019s foot so it went all the way through and he got hung up, the horse spooked and dragged the boy, and the boy did end up dying. The kid\u2019s parents were trying suing the farm/horse owner for everything they had, and also trying to go after the trainer but she was not responsible. Equestrian sports are activities where children can EASILY DIE if not handled correctly, and she\u2019s bringing other people\u2019s children onto your property and endangering their lives, without insurance.

Every barn I've ever ridden at or even visited had horses in stalls. A 30-horse barn wasn't on a 45-acre plot, and most of the extra space was arenas. We used them for turnouts and longeing. The horses were well-cared-for, healthy, and happy.", "I beg to differ. Every barn I've ever ridden at or visited feeds hay (and maybe supplements) and the horses are fine. Foraging on grass is nice, but it's not necessary. Horses can get all the exercise they need in arenas.", "I have enough money now to buy the horse I've always wanted.

Because it seems like that's what makes the difference. \n\nWhere I live, all horses stay in stalls (having a turnout attached is a huge bonus) and are fed twice a day, more if they get supplements as lunch. My friend owns a huge ranch/ breeding station, and while she has huge turnouts, where horses can stay for a while, even those are fed.

I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt, but there\u2019s also what happens when someone does. Do you want to lose your farm when one of those kids gets hurt? She is putting you at significant risk.", "NTA - I handle General Liability insurance for youth activities and this is NO joke.  Horses are on the higher end of the risk level.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t let her do a SINGLE lesson without insurance.  I can point you to a reputable company that offers this stuff if you like.", "NTA. She\u2019s a walking liability waiting to happen.", "NTA. Nothing like being sued for negligence and disrupt your life completely.", "NTA", "I live on an acre and don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough space for just my kids", "NTA, no insurance = no lessons. it\u2019s super risky for you and you aren\u2019t a day care for minors on your property. also NTA for that many animals in that area. in my state, you don\u2019t really ever see an acre an animal, especially on home farms. my horse is lucky to have a half acre run off her stall. if you\u2019re a LLC you need double insurance not just liability so PLEASE make sure you\u2019re covered", "Sad that I had to scroll this far to find this response. Truthfully, ESH.", "I have done all of those things on your list. Except she lied about her insurance.", "Don\u2019t forget the chickens!  And it sound like 4 horses\u2026OPs three and the boarder.  Also my first thought\u2026an acre isnt that much land even for a hobby farm.  ESH", "12 by 12 stall is standard for most barns with the exception of a foaling stall", "It's terrible for horses, or any livestock, to be kept inside all day, both physically and emotionally. Horses need to be outside to graze, roll and socialize.", "Yep.  We grew up as a family of 4 with a 60lb dog and 2 cats - in a house on 1/6th of an acre.  50x150 feet ish lot size.  Plenty of room for all of us, assuming we walked the dog regularly so he got more roaming than our small yard and house.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have had the dog in an apartment the size of our house though, unless we lived next to a park with a good dog park.", "So you're telling me that if you take riding lessons and get hurt, insurance doesn't take care of it? I've never sued for being in car accidents or been sued, but insurance has paid. Even if there is proof of liability - like broken equipment, improperly maintained equipment, old helmets, etc.?  That is fascinating.  I'm calling my old stables tomorrow to ask this.", "Except for when the person offering lessons is negligent in some way.", "I think you deeply misunderstood the law. They generally cover \u201cinherent risk\u201d from equine activities due to the unpredictability of a horse\u2019s behavior. This means things like getting kicked by a horse, getting bitten, or a horse being spooked by a noise and you being injured. These laws do not cover the following:\n\n1. Knowingly providing faulty tack or equipment;\n\n2. Failing to make reasonable and prudent efforts to determine the ability of the participant in order to match the ability of the participant with an appropriate horse;\n\n3. Failing to warn the participant of a known, hidden dangerous condition; and\n\n4. Intentionally injuring the participant.\n\nOr, any other situation where the teacher, in OP\u2019s case, would be responsible for safety and care. Further more, most of these laws require signage and liability releases inform parties to the danger.\n\nFinally, these are not shield laws. They do not prevent anyone from being sued, they simply provide a legal defense to covered individuals (i.e., equine professionals and activity sponsors). This means that the case may be dismissed or thrown out early in the legal process. If the lawsuit is not dismissed in its entirety, the statute may assist in resolving the case for a lower settlement amount prior to trial.\n\nIn OP\u2019s case, I doubt the renter was following the law, if applicable, about signage and liability waivers. The case of letting kids wander around for 30-45 minutes without direct supervision, is pretty clear evidence that people were unaware of the dangers. So, these laws would probably be of little benefit to them.", "They can get that in turnout, and they even enjoy riding together in arenas. There is no NEED to graze if they are fed. \n\nI do not advocate for horses to be inside all day, just saying they do not need an acre or more for foraging. There is nothing to suggest OP doesn't take their horses out, and in a comment they mentioned their land is next to an open space they use for exercising.", "Hm, odd you\u2019re so judgemental about a setup that\u2019s 100% common west of the Mississippi. Especially in the area where OP is there\u2019s little natural forage so most places have round bales out year round. Is it smaller than ideal? Oh you betcha, but it sounds like Op has made good effort to give them access to the larger area as much as possible. It is extremely common for board out west to be a stall with an attached dry run, no turnout. God forbid you take a trip to Canada where they\u2019re inside half the year at most places. Also do you know how most racehorses live? Not everyone can live in Wellington, and OP is clearly making an effort to do right with what she has. Maybe put your pitchfork down. You\u2019re commenting on things like getting parasites like OP doesn\u2019t deworm or care for them at all.", "According to industry standards of the time, Titanic had enough lifeboats.", "In Texas I had to sign a notarized statement that acknowledged that horse riding is an inherently dangerous activity with a risk of death and that I had no right to sue anyone for negligence before my kids could have riding lessons", "Medical insurance would cover it, but under normal circumstances, you (or your insurer) would be unable to recoup damages. \n\nMy state (NJ) has exceptions for *knowingly* providing equipment or tack that is faulty and acts or omissions by the operator that constitute negligent disregard. But if you're taking riding lessons and get hurt from falling off a horse or getting bucked (again, subject to specific exceptions), you're SOL.", "Read my comment above, it\u2019s not as cut & dry as that commenter suggests.", "Horses in Canada can spend time outside in -30 weather with a coat on. They\u2019re not *fragile*.", "It is out west. Everyone here commenting this has clearly never been to a farm west of the Mississippi.", "My understanding was that the Titanic DID have enough lifeboats, for the designated number of crew and passengers, but they drastically overloaded the ship.", "Sources vary but it\u2019s agreed that Titanic could carry between 3300 and 3500 passengers and crew. For her maiden voyage sources say she carried approx 2200 passengers and crew. While sources may differ on the exact numbers, all agree she was far below capacity. \n\nThe 16 lifeboats and 4 collapsibles she carried could hold 1178. She had room for 64 lifeboats, but in 1912 the number of required lifeboats was determined by tonnage, not capacity. \n\nWhile it\u2019s true that by today\u2019s standards Titanic was woefully under equipped according to her capacity, by the standards of her time she actually exceeded the requirements for tonnage.\nThe prevailing theory was that lifeboats weren\u2019t needed to save lives but to ferry passengers to a rescue ship in case of emergency. It was thought that if a ship were to founder help would arrive in plenty of time to avoid loss of life. \n\nAfter the sinking, laws on both sides of the Atlantic were changed and thanks to Titanic all ships now carry enough lifeboats to accommodate all on board.\n\nThe great irony of Titanic is that while her tragedy no doubt led to greater safety on the sea, current laws wouldn\u2019t have helped her.\n\nIn the 2 hours and 20 minutes she took to sink, the 16 lifeboats and 2 of the collapsibles were successfully launched. The 2 remaining collapsibles were washed from the decks as she went under. One was partially full and the other was capsized. Approximately 40 men were able to balance on this boat until Carpathia\u2019s arrival.\n\nEven if Titanic had enough lifeboats, even if the filling and launching of the boats began within minutes of hitting the iceberg, even if they had been filled to capacity, Titanic still would have had lifeboats attached to the davits as she went under and still would have suffered a massive loss of life. There simply wasn\u2019t enough time to fully evacuate the ship.", "Why are you quoting a Northern Irish website when a previous post indicated you lived in \"Mormon country\"? Also, those are the absolute minimum requirements indicated for stable size from the British Horse Society, not an accepted industry standard, and not in isolation, they are purely stable sizes, not overall accommodation sizes."]}
