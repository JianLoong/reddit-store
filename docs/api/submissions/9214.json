Horses are not cheap \"pets\" they require so much work, time, attention, care, and sometimes very pricey vet bills.

I'd say evict her sooner if at all possible but at the same time, that poor horse deserves better.", "NTA \u2026 but YWBTA if you let it continue with the knowledge that it is not safe for her customers. I\u2019m in another industry that insurance deems \u201crisky\u201d and the lawsuit will destroy everyone when someone gets hurt.\n\nThis is also venturing into ESH territory because how did you not get the proof of insurance and her rules for students (or the contract she makes parents sign) before she started teaching lessons.

She did not respect your demands.  It is imperative that you shut down her daycare..I mean business.", "NTA it sounds like she\u2019s an accident waiting to happen.

I think thata very reasonable.", "NTA it's your property, you owe her nothing.", "NTA.  You gave her reasonable and fair expectations that she repeatedly failed to meet.  And she lied to your face. It sucks that she is in such a tough position, but she's only going to make her situation worse if she doesn't have insurance or proper oversight of her students.  And yes if anything happened you would have the most to lose.", "Nta you were kind to offer her your property if she won\u2019t respect you by doing this business legally then you have every right to shut it down", "NTA. \n\nThis is a lawsuit waiting to happen.\nNever ever let anyone give riding lessons on your property.", "NTA\n\nYou gave reasonable expectations and she chose to not follow them.", "NTA", "Nope NTA she is acting irresponsibly and not holding up any of her side of the bargain.
