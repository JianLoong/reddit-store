She had left her daughter alone for 30 hours while she was a baby and this is how she lost custody. Her ex now has full custody and he is not in contact with any of our family and we had not seen the daughter in 2 years.\n\nAfter this my cousin got married and she\u2019s still on drugs, but she\u2019s doing better than before. She hasn\u2019t had a binge in a while, but we don\u2019t know for sure because she doesn\u2019t keep in close contact with us. Well, my whole entire dads side of the family were going for a photo shoot last weekend and I asked her if she wanted to come and she said she couldn\u2019t make it. I decided that I would like her daughter to come so I drove 3 hours to her exs house (I didn\u2019t know if he still resided there I was just hoping) to ask him if I could take his daughter to the photo shoot the next day.\n\nHe ended up still living there and was hesitant but he said that he thinks it would be nice for her to see her grandpa and great-grandparents and agreed and let me have her for a sleep over. His only rule was that his daughter would not see her mother and that I could not tell her I had her. I agreed. My whole family was so happy to see her and many of my uncles and aunts started crying. We had the photo shoot and I brought her home the next day with some photos of the shoot for her dad.\n\nMy family posted the photos on social media and now my cousin is SUPER pissed at me for not informing her I had her daughter for a day. She said that she would have loved to see her daughter because the dad won\u2019t let her see her at all. I told her that he said she wasn\u2019t allowed to see her and that I was just trying to respect his wishes so that we are able to see her again in the future. Now she\u2019s posting horrible things about me on social media. Should I have told her? My mom agrees with my cousin and said that I should \u201cstick with family\u201d and that the dad would have never known.", "created_utc": 1676779189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1160yq7/aita_for_not_telling_my_cousin_i_had_her_daughter/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Had you gone against her Dad\u2019s wishes, he\u2019d never trust anyone in your family again. \n\nYour cousin can go through the courts to gain access to her daughter. It\u2019s not your responsibility to help her with going behind her ex\u2019s back", "NTA- you were respecting her father's wishes.  If her mother wanted to bring her life she should have cleaned up her act and never left a baby alone for that long.   Good on Dad for setting boundaries and good for you for respecting those boundaries.", "NTA.  You respected the custodial parent\u2019s rules.", "NTA - it sounds like it's in the custody arrangement that way, and if you did, you'd be violating a judge's order. She lost her daughter, she has no rights to her. You did the right thing, and because you did it right, you are the portal for the child to have a relationship with her mom's family. However, your family sounds like they won't respect the father and the orders, and I'd be VERY CAREFUL if you ever end up visiting with the child again.", "NTA. The only thing that would have accomplished was losing access to the girl for the whole rest of the family.", "NTA. The ex who has custody is in control of the visitation of the child. You followed his requirements. She can go pound sand.", "NTA. You made a wonderful family memory for the little girl and respected the father's wishes, who has full custodial rights. The child deserves to meet the rest of her family and know that they love her.", "NTA OP\n\nYou are absolutely right to think that not listening to dad would have meant not seeing her again. What if the script was flipped and dad was a druggie who left poor baby alone for 30 hours? Addicts typically don't change (with some exceptions, and this is highly dependent on if they've had help and what their addiction even is). Judging by her response, I don't think she has changed tbh. If you want to see her again *you listen to the person who has custody of her.*", "NTA. Yes he would have known because the kid would tell him all about it.", "NTA, I grew up in similar situation. That's between her and the father.", "NTA.  The dad would have found out and all contact would be cut until the daughter is of an age to seek it herself.  You're going to have to be careful in the future if you get her again to ensure none of your family reach out to the mother without the child's father's permission.", "What happened between them and the custody issues have nothing to do with you, you given the ability to see this child and hopefully again. You don't owe anything to your cousin and were only following the orders of the parent with custody.\n\nIf she has an issue she can take it up with her child's father. Not scape goat you.\n\n\nNta", "NTA!! I love how it was a photo shoot and mom and cousin are trying to say that he wouldn\u2019t have found out. He totally would have. You did the right thing!", "NTA\n\nIf the girls mother wants to see her again, she needs to take it to court.", "NTA the kid would have told her dad. It would have messed up her head so badly and she didnt deserve to be alone to meet her. You did stick with family - you chose the child and did what was best for her.", "NTA.    \n\nHe is the custodial parent, he makes the rules, if you want to see her you follow them.  End of story", "NTA.\n\nCousin made her bed, cousin should lie in it.\n\nKudos to the dad for taking up the slack, he's obviously the real parent here. \n\nAlso you're definitely NTA, as you were caring for the kid while cousin was MIA.", "Are you kidding....you haven't seen this child in two years and the father let's you take her 3 hours away for an overnight visit....for a photo.", "NTA. This is tough though. I think she lost privileges with her behavior so I don\u2019t totally feel bad for her", "NTA. Those photos were all over social media. The dad would have found out.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin lost custody for good reason.  The dad is the custodial parent now.  He makes the all the decisions about what his child can and can't do. Period.  Finished.  \n\nYou did the right thing.", "Nta  the \u201cstick with family\u201d comment is so stupid. That baby is your family.", "NTA. She lost custody for a reason. She doesn't deserve to have her daughter back until she cleans up and proves it legally (court appointed visits). I'm happy that the girl got to see the family again, and hopefully since you kept your word dad will let her visit more often.", "NTA.  Family did stick together!  You protected your little cousin (the baby) from her neglectful mother.  When a family member harms a baby,  your loyalty is to the baby who is also family but can not protect themselves.  You stuck to the family member who needed you the most.  For someone to suggest you should support the abuser over the abused us just awful! Did they forget that the baby is family too?", "NTA if you would\u2019ve told her she would\u2019ve showed up and you would\u2019ve lost the opportunity ever see your niece again good for you for respecting the father\u2019s wishes she has no right to even see her daughter after what she did to her.", "NTA. Your cousin chose drugs over her daughter. You chose to honor the little girl's custodial parent's wishes. Tell her and your mom to grow up and put the kid's needs first.", "NTA\n\n>the dad would have never known.\n\nWith pictures being posted on social media, the odds are not zero that he would have found out. Your mom is being very short-sighted. Doing what you did leaves open the prospects of future visits.", "Your mother is toxic for ascribing to the whole \"stand by your family no matter how horrible they are just because they're blood-related to you\" garbage. Your cousin is an addict, she has chosen drugs over her child and the child's father is protecting his daughter. Your mother is trying to force you to do a dishonest and disrespectful thing. I'm not a person who believes it's only wrong if you get caught. It's still wrong even if no one ever finds out. NTA, but your cousin seems mom sure are.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His mother and my father were best friends and even went to the same college together. She sadly passed away a couple of years ago. He knows me and my family very well, so I\u2019m sure he was very comfortable with us just not with my cousin having access to her."]}
