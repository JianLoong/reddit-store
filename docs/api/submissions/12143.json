Maybe he should hang out with friends who can handle their alcohol.", "NTA and FYI some carpet cleaning companies such as Stanley Steamer will come to your house and shampoo the carpet in the car.", "This happened with my husband and his friend at a Christmas party, winter, -30\u2026 left overnight. Dude rolled the window down and didn\u2019t make it\u2026 do you know what my husband did\u2026 got a bucket of soapy hot water and multiple rags and got his friend to clean it up. Do you know what his friend did? He cleaned it up and apologized profusely for throwing up and thanked us for giving him a ride instead of walking black out drunk home and potentially passing out in his way and freezing to death. Your BF and his friend are TA and need to grow up. You are definitely NTA", "NTA! The puker is 100% responsible for the detailing.", "NTA They can shove it along with the stupid lame excuse that somehow you are at fault. if I were you I would refuse to be the DD from now on because your driving might cause vomiting and we wouldn\u2019t want that!", "NTA. They are grown men who should learn to hold their liquor. You didn\u2019t throw up and you didn\u2019t forcethem get so drunk that they were incapable of cleaning up after themselves.", "You are definitely providing a one-sided opionion to get people you don't know on your side. I only say this because there is no inkling of you being in the wrong. If what you say is the case, wtf are you doing wasting time with that loser", "Wow. Just... wow. So NTA, don't pay a dime. Your bf & his friends, on the other hand... yikes.", "YWBTA if you keep dating this guy.", "NTA\n\nThey said they would take care of it. They chose to drink to a drunken state. It is their fault they did not clean it. He needs to have it professionally cleaned. They need to take an uber next time. You owe nothing towards the cleaning. You cannot force anyone to do what they say they are going to do timely. This is all on them.", "NTA and flat out tell him if he feels that way when he can be designated driver for his friends from now on.", "NTA, bf is being an entitled prick", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nWtf?! It\u2019s your fault because you picked their drunk asses up and drove on a bumpy road?? Do they normally just throw up on bumpy roads then leave it there?\n\nYuck. So gross all around. But if I was your boyfriend -no matter how trashed I was-I would have tried to clean it before passing out. Actually-I would have had garbage bags available in the first place. \n\nThe nerve trying to blame you. What a child.", "NTA.  You drove, you didn't throw up.  You didn't get throughly intoxicated that you passed out after you got home.  You do not have to pay for the clean up.  \n\nThe passengers need to take responsibility for their actions.", "NTA but I actually laughed when I read your story. Your boyfriend and his friends go out, get wasted and friend pukes in the car because you went up a bumpy driveway too fast. Did they actually say that with a straight face?  Did you laugh or did your mouth just drop open because someone said something that stupid?  You need to have everyone sign a waiver next time you are the DD to let them know about how you drive on bumpy roads so they can\u2019t hold you responsible if they vomit. Otherwise don\u2019t let them in the car.", "Agreed and boyfriend said he\u2019d deal with it in the morning. NTA! \n\nAnd OP this is a giant, neon red flag.", "Good for you.  I\u2019m sorry it took this for you to see it, but you\u2019re so much better off.  I\u2019ve been the DD my whole adult life and it sucks when you\u2019re mistreated instead of appreciated when you\u2019re doing it.  Also, if he fully sober and clear headed can say it would have been better if he drove drunk?? then he is not the kind of person you want to be with.", "Good for you. He showed you who he is, and you don't want any of that in your life. Now you're free to find a better partner. Good luck!", "Good for you, OP. Addition by subtraction.", "Good riddance to bad rubbish!", "wow im so glad to see a happy ending for once on this sub! congrats for sticking up for yourself!", "Congratulations! A clean break from a stinky mess. You deserve way better.", "Hey, at least the gave you all the motivation to discuss and end things. Seemed like a childish person to be with.", "And he\u2019s getting his friend to gang up on her too.", "NTA\n\nThe friend didn't throw up cause you drove too fast up the driveway. He threw up cause he drank too much. Your boyfriend and his friend are ridiculous. \ud83d\udea9", "This! How are you going to blame the driving when you drank enough to puke everywhere at a bump!", "she made an update in the comments! she left him!", "She sucks if she continues to date this guy.", "Absolutely. I\u2019d never do it again", "So true!", "Lol I was thinking \u2026 yes. They seem like the type who would blame the Uber driver", "NTA\n\nBut, pro-tip: coffee grounds are your friend! Keep a cannister of cheap coffee. When there is vomit to clean up, throw some on top. Helps with the smell and helps with clean up. Makes it less slimy.", "NTA. Don't put a dime in...friend who puked should pay for it all", "NTA. Fuck allat you aint his mommy. Dont drive for that drunkard and lose the weight. He aint worth it", "NTA. Let him find a new DD", "NTA They said they would do it and didn\u2019t. definitely not your problem in the first place.", "It\u2019s YOUR fault a drunk person threw up in the car??? Jesus Christ, your man is an ass and his friends are the same, so nothing will ever be his fault. They will always agree it\u2019s not on him and support their boy. I can\u2019t see this going well in the long run.", "NTA don\u2019t marry this guy. He seems to think you are his servant. Very entitled for a guy that has a girlfriend that drive him and his childish friends around all night.", "Ffs nta\u2026start dating a grown up.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHis friend messed up the car, therefore his friend has to pay to get it cleaned.\n\nYou didn't do it so it's not your problem\n\nJust read the update: good riddance. Hope you find someone will appreciate you and spend time with you", "NTA\n\nWhat in the holy misogyny crow is going on here? Being a DD is being the sober chauffeur, not chaperone. You drive; you are not responsible for their behavior. I love their claim that they were too drunk to know to clean up the puke, but not too drunk to know how your driving was. \n\nDo not put up with this toxic male frat boy shit. Not all men are like this. He's 23. He should know better. Dump this guy.", "NTA. If I were you I'd run from the red flags.", "Reddit is always like \u201cyour SO\u2019s behavior is\u201d *insert Lemongrab meme here* \u201cUNACCEPTABUULLLLLLLL! Leave them immediately!\u201d", "NTA - but I'd DTMFA", "Seriously this, why should OP be paying anything at all for it? It's not her responsibility to deal with that.", "I only got drunk twice, and one of the times I threw up in a stranger's car (I didn't listen to the warnings my doctor gave not to drink on my meds). My dad cleaned it which omg was so awkward. \n\nI was so mortified I *begged* them to take money for an interior detail. They were honestly the nicest person I could have experienced in that situation. I can't imagine not wanting to pay for a detail or something.", "It\u2019s a special kind of asshole who requests and favor and then thinks getting that favor means they are also totally entitled to other favors. \n\nIf a man acts like you are obligated to clean up after him and sulks when you don\u2019t, dump him.  Any time someone tries to explain to you why their bad behavior was actually *your* fault, run.  \n\nNTA but this man is a whole pile of red flags.", "He would have been better off driving himself home drunk?? Bruh. \n\nCongrats on losing the baggage before things got way worse. Situations like this don\u2019t get better, they get more frequent. \n\nHope the next one treats you the way you deserve!", "Good for you. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been tough but you made the right call 100%.", "This isn\u2019t gaslighting, this is just someone being an AH. Gaslighting is when someone makes you question reality around you, not when someone makes you feel like rubbish & question whether you are the AH. \n\nThe meaning behind words like this get diluted if we use them incorrectly and there\u2019s a real life impact (I\u2019ve been guilty of this too! I really recommend you do some research on the word) \n\nBut I completely agree with everything else you said", "Yeah OP, he\u2019s a guy and how can he be expected to remember and follow through things like cleaning HIS car in which HIS friend vomited? You are a lowly woman who is only fit to be the designated driver and clean up vomit or gently nudge everyone to clean up. For morons, /s. NTA", "This exactly this!", "I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with gender. Even if the gender roles were switched or a different gender was use instead- it doesn\u2019t make a difference. Though, there\u2019s really no need to get pressed over an OPINION when it was literally asked for. Your a lowly human who can\u2019t seem to understand that I\u2019m not against the girlfriend at all. I was only trying to explain how the boyfriend might of felt/ hopefully to help make things a bit easier for the two of them?

What right does the bf have to be mad at OP?", "Wow what a bunch of assholes \nNta here but do you really want that in ur life for the rest of ur life too", "NTA.\n\nHis friend who threw up should be paying the entire cleaning bill.  You get so wasted you vomit all over your friend's stuff?  You pay to have it cleaned.\n\nYou tried telling him and his friends it needed to be cleaned.  You were told he'd deal with it in the morning.  If you'd tried forcing him to deal with it right then I'm willing to bet you'd be writing this AITA about how you forced him to deal with it and now he's angry so should you have maybe let him leave it overnight like he wanted.\n\nHe sounds like a jerk.  Don't give him a dime toward the cleaning.", "NTA here.  They are the drunkholes who made the mess.  You are a designated driver not the maid.", "NTA. \n\n\nAnswer is... next time he wants a DD you ask whos fault puke in the back of the car is that night.", "NTA you are not to blame. They drank, they vomited, they made stupid choices. You are not their parent and you did remind them. Tell them you will not take responsibility for their bad behavior. If that's what they want, next time they should give you their parents' phone numbers before they drink so you can call them and their own damned parents can tell them what to do. Also, tell them you will never DD again since they have so little appreciation. Tell them to find someone else to kick around. You've got more self-respect than to do nice things for jerks.", "NTA. You were the sober one, and you weren't responsible for the puking that ensued. You were simply the driver. They shouldn't be trying to hold you accountable for something that you didn't do. The aftermath is something that your boyfriend has to deal with.", "NTA they shouldn\u2019t drink so much that they puke in the car", "NTA, and cleaning up would be enabling their behavior, frankly.", "No, you're not the asshole in this situation. You did your part by being the designated driver and driving your boyfriend and his friends safely home. When the friend threw up in the backseat, you trusted your boyfriend and his friends to take care of it as they assured you they would.  \n\nIt's not your responsibility to clean up after someone else's mess, especially when they explicitly told you not to worry about it. Your boyfriend and his friends should have taken care of the vomit that night or at least made arrangements to clean it up promptly the next morning.  \n\nIt's also unfair for your boyfriend and his friends to blame you for the vomit or for the smell not leaving the car, as the responsibility lies solely on the person who threw up in the car. It's good that they're splitting the cost of the detailing, but it's not your responsibility to contribute financially since you had no control over the situation.  \n\nYou did your part as a responsible designated driver, and it's not fair for your boyfriend and his friends to put the blame on you for something that was out of your control.", "Good for you! He showed his true colours and you acted accordingly.\n\nIf he was acting like this after *only three months*, how on earth would he have been acting in three years? Bullet dodged.", "I love happy endings screw that guy.", "\"You want me to DD again? Gosh, I'd*love* to, but I'm such a bumpy driver, and not very good at forcing drunk people to do chores they don't want to do, I'm afraid it just wouldn't be responsible of me. You understand.\"", "True, but I think OP's post really WAS about the vomit.  She said in an edit that she and the guy talked and broke up, so she turned out NTA!", "Yup.  We live in audacious times . . .", "Yes (little fist pump)!!!!!", "How does that fit with the boyfriend thinking OP should be contributing financially to the car detailing?"]}
