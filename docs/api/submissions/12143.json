My boyfriend let me use his new car, so last night when I picked them up they were extremely drunk. One of his friends with him threw up in the backseat as we were pulling into the drive way. I am someone who hates vomit and would probably throw up myself if I were to clean it. They assured me they would clean it themselves and not to worry about it. Once we got inside the friend who threw up went straight to bed as did the other friends. I reminded my boyfriend about the throw up in the car and he said he was too drunk to deal with it and would figure it out in the morning. I said okay and went to bed. Now he has been angry at me all for not cleaning it up or at least convincing him or one of his friends to clean that night because now it was dried up and the smell will not leave his new car. He is putting the blame on me because as the sober one I should have at least told him that this needed to be dealt with in the moment rather than the next morning. Him and his friends have also agreed that had I not driven up the bumpy drive way so quickly that the friend would probably have never even thrown up in the first place. My boyfriend is taking the car to get detailed and the friend is splitting the cost with him but they feel that I am part to blame and should also be putting money towards the cleaning which I am refusing.
