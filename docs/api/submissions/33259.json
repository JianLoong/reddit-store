I know what she really meant was spending time with her and her family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her that they're adults and are welcome to make plans with me if they want to.

I said no, I told her the twins could make their own holiday plans. My wife was not happy with this solution and told me that I needed to work harder to tend to both of my families.

Either you raised them to be train wrecks, or you didn\u2019t raise them, and you have insisted that you did. \nYou\u2019re a horrible father.
