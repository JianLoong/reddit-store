There's me, 43M, and I live with my beautiful wife, 42F, and our three children, 13M/13F/9F. But I also have two kids with my ex, both 19F. Recently she's gotten remarried and has another daughter who's 3 now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've had a hard time with the coparenting. When the twins were younger, we lived in the same apartment building and tried our best, but shit happened and her mental health got bad and a lot of resentment built up between her and my family. I wanted to move on and she couldn't seem to take care of her kids properly. The kids themselves are also trainwrecks, though I guess I can't blame them based on who their mother is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut things are going a little better now since she has her new husband. She's settled down in a nice house and this year she called to ask how we were doing Christmas. I asked what she meant. I honestly don't like talking to her much and was eager for her to hang up the phone. She sounded like she was confused and said she thought I would want to spend time with the girls. I know what she really meant was spending time with her and her family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her that they're adults and are welcome to make plans with me if they want to. She said that my wife and sister invited her, her husband, and kids to the annual Christmas eve party. I said \"there's your plans\" and hung up on her to focus on work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen this evening my wife comes into my home office looking pissed off. She asked if I told my ex off. I said no, I told her the twins could make their own holiday plans. My wife was not happy with this solution and told me that I needed to work harder to tend to both of my families. I told her that I have one family. She was utterly appalled by this and stormed out. Now my wife, ex, and sister (who are all best friends) are calling me an AH and saying I need to put in more effort for my ex and her kids.

Yeah, that's a pretty fucked up situation you got there but if your wife thinks the same about your 'break' (which she seems to), I'm not calling you a cheater.

In stead of keeping the twins away from your other children, just teach them proper manners in stead of trying to ditch them.
