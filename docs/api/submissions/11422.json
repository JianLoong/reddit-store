That's incredibly fucking dangerous. Why did boyfriend think that was okay?!", "NTA that was very stupid of your boyfriend to do. Kids mimic what they see and it doesn't take long to suffocate. He needs to take some parenting classes if he doesn't have common sense.", "NTA\n\nA 1yr old does not understand the risks and they love to copy mum and dad.\n\nIt might have been a little bit of fun for dad but the potential risks are huge.  Never demonstrate dangerous things because they are funny to young children, that\u2019s asking for disaster.", "NTA. He's at exactly the age where this is a hazard.", "NTA He did something really dumb and got mad that you called him out on it. Even if you did snap it\u2019s warranted, your son could have swallowed the plastic or suffocated like you said.", "Well, you *might have* snapped because let's face it, that's just stupid and child welfare comes before the adult's wittle feelers.  It sounds like your boyfriend is \n\n1) not knowledgeable about children\n\n2) insecure and defensive \n\nIt's his *child*.  He should be more interested in keeping the baby safe than whether he screwed up because he's new at this Dad thing.  NTA", "NTA at all. What\u2019s next?

Some people like to pretend facts are attacks and it's bizzare.", "NTA, I personally feel the right thing to do would be to ask your husband what made him feel you were snapping, and how you can communicate in a way that both of you find effective. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong by telling him not to do that, at 1 that\u2019s just asking for trouble, but maybe there\u2019s something more, some stress that either made you snappier than you meant to be or made him feel more defensive than usual.
