They could have noticed a soft preference and placed this change in rules in that pattern. Only you know that. Maybe you aren't doing any preference.

Yet I still somehow managed to be grounded through most of high school over really trivial shit because of my parent's more authoritarian parenting style.\n\nFor example: I was 23 when I got my first tattoo & my mom took it as a personal attack and lost her mind. When my brother was 20, she asked me and my sister if we wanted to chip in for our brother's first tattoo as a gift. I'll admit I didn't take that well despite being over 30. It felt like a slap in the face & it was difficult to shirk the seething resentment I felt over this blatant difference (for the record I never for a second felt angry or resentful toward my brother or had any actual jealousy. My hard feelings were solely toward my parents).\n\nThat said, I have come to grips with the fact that eldest children are inherently experimental. It literally can not be helped. That just is what it is. Yes, I still grappled with copious resentment toward my parents for raising us so differently. My childhood & teen years were spent lying to my parents just so I could have some autonomy. My youngest brother just did not experience that except for a small handful of times. \n\nI'm gonna say NAH because you did learn from your mistakes. My parents did not. They were just older, and my brother was a particularly easy kid. He technically started out with the same rules but was almost always eventually allowed a lot of leeway with them.

At some point, she needs to come to grips that yes, she was the experimental child, and that just is what it is. She has to figure out how to work through that now as an adult. But you need to understand how deep these things cut, how difficult it is to just get over even as an adult.

I also was forced to be a third parent to them. It sucked all around.\n\nI'm now a mom of 2. My daughter is 9 and my son is 1. There ARE ways I'm raising them differently. Things HAVE changed since my daughter was a baby- in society, in safety regulations, in my own personal growth and development as a parent- and at the end of the day, they're different kids. Even if they were closer in age, you just don't raise every kid exactly the same, because THEY'RE not the same. If my mom had grounded my brother by sending him to stay in his room, he'd have gone crazy. If she did that to me, I'd have read for days on end and been fine. What works for one kid might not work for the other(s).\n\nI'm gonna say ESH. Your kids need to understand that times and YOU have changed, and YOU need to sincerely apologize to them for any parenting choices you made that were wrong, and explain why you've chosen to change some rules to reflect those lessons you've learned.", "As the eldest kid whose parents were way stricter with me than they were my little brother, I say NAH.

However, they are adults now.\n\nYou should straight up ask them if they think your youngest two should go through what they did. It sounds like to me that is their argument. If it is, it's a flawed one (there's even a fancy Latin name for it). \n\nThe best you can do now apologize and move on. If they still have a problem, it becomes a them problem.

The youngest one always gets the most attention and consideration, because he/she is considered the 'baby' and the last of the kids to be raised.  It's a VERY common family dynamic.

My sisters ultimately understood that when the conversation came up with my dad, and though at first they weren\u2019t happy, open communication and my dad owning up to and apologizing for his mistakes to my siblings went a long way in them being receptive to it", "NTA this is just part of having multiple children. As the oldest sibling, you often feel like your younger siblings get away with murder, and the reality is the oldest has more responsibilities but gets to do cooler things (like driving) earlier than the younger ones, so giving the younger children more freedom evens the feelings of unfairness out. Plus, parents just get tired as time goes on, there\u2019s no parent on the planet that isn\u2019t worn down by child 3 or 4, so the natural progression is that the younger siblings get more leniency at an earlier age than the older siblings got.

OP made a rule in good faith for the older kids, but learned from experience that it needed to be less strict, just because the older kids are pissed they had to adhere to the more strict rule doesn't make the OP an AH.
