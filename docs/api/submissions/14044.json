Yet I still somehow managed to be grounded through most of high school over really trivial shit because of my parent's more authoritarian parenting style.\n\nFor example: I was 23 when I got my first tattoo & my mom took it as a personal attack and lost her mind. When my brother was 20, she asked me and my sister if we wanted to chip in for our brother's first tattoo as a gift. I'll admit I didn't take that well despite being over 30. It felt like a slap in the face & it was difficult to shirk the seething resentment I felt over this blatant difference (for the record I never for a second felt angry or resentful toward my brother or had any actual jealousy. My hard feelings were solely toward my parents).\n\nThat said, I have come to grips with the fact that eldest children are inherently experimental. It literally can not be helped. That just is what it is. Yes, I still grappled with copious resentment toward my parents for raising us so differently. My childhood & teen years were spent lying to my parents just so I could have some autonomy. My youngest brother just did not experience that except for a small handful of times. \n\nI'm gonna say NAH because you did learn from your mistakes. My parents did not. They were just older, and my brother was a particularly easy kid. He technically started out with the same rules but was almost always eventually allowed a lot of leeway with them.

At some point, she needs to come to grips that yes, she was the experimental child, and that just is what it is. She has to figure out how to work through that now as an adult. But you need to understand how deep these things cut, how difficult it is to just get over even as an adult.

My mother was way more lenient with them than she was with my older brother and I. I have pointed this out to her but I don't hold it against her. My dad didn't do any parenting and my mom was just tired by the time she had to really dig in with my younger siblings during their teenage years.", "This is pretty much exactly how my childhood vs my younger siblings was.

My older siblings had full freedom during their teenage years and it went somewhat bad for them. My parents went the opposite direction with me and I had the strictest upbringing of all my siblings.

No parent is perfect and parenting is an evolving thing.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA. I\u2019m actually a little annoyed at the amount of Y T A votes. I\u2019m curious to know how many of them are coming from parents.\n\nParenting is hard. The entire concept of \u201ckids being bitter at parents for parenting failures\u201d is a generational constant we can rely on as a society. I realized that I\u2019d reached a place of maturity and mental healthiness as a person when I accepted that my parents did the best they could with me based on the \u201cgenerational parenting toolbox\u201d they inherited. The concept (not mine) goes something like this: \u201cGenerations ago, parents only knew how to use a hammer to parent. Every problem that arose, they hammered at it. Their children inherited that parenting toolbox and the hammer. However, in the course of **their** parenting, they developed a screwdriver to tackle some problems that a hammer didn\u2019t fix. So their children inherited a parenting toolbox with a hammer and screwdriver. This still didn\u2019t fix all the problems that arise when parenting, but it was an improvement. The next generation of parents from this line (through trial and error,) developed a saw. And the generational parenting toolbox continued to develop, until generations down the line, new parents inherit a much more comprehensive toolbox and are therefore much better parents.\u201d\n\nThe reason for this analogy is that parents don\u2019t always get it right, and while apologizing in general as a parent is important, I don\u2019t think that a parent is an AH for doing the best they could and not getting it 100% right as long as they\u2019re trying. I don\u2019t even think apologizing is 100% warranted in this specific case. What is this parent apologizing for - trying to allow their children to be children and trying to stop them from making significant dating choices before their brains were more developed? They realized that their efforts weren\u2019t getting them the results they wanted, so they changed their approach in order to try and protect their younger children better and to try and maintain better control of a potentially not-great situation (such as unplanned pregnancy, STDs, etc.) If anything, **this is good.** So many parents can\u2019t accept their mistakes and make parenting changes as they go. They double down out of a desire to not admit failure. I also can\u2019t help but feel concern for individuals who have a \u201cI had to suffer so others should suffer\u201d mentality. How is this different from hazing culture or people complaining about student loan forgiveness or debt relief changes bc they didn\u2019t benefit? It\u2019s unfortunate that the older children felt that their parents didn\u2019t parent them \u201cright,\u201d but they should be thrilled that their younger siblings are benefiting from their parent\u2019s growth and getting better parenting\u2026 unless they want them to suffer as well\u2026 which IMO is AH behavior.\n\nAlso\u2026 What do the older children want an apology for? Rules meant to protect them when they were younger, such dating too young and possibly having sex before they were ready? I don\u2019t think the parent in question is theoretically wrong or incorrect in his perspective that dating too young is problematic for many psychological and developmental reasons. There are literal studies on the damage that activating certain sexual behaviors too young (before their brains are appropriately developed) can do to children. This parent sounds like a loving, invested parent who made an understandable error in judgment in the approach to trying to keep their children safe. You can\u2019t convince me that the 10 year old who has sex fully understands what they\u2019re doing and doesn\u2019t experience significant regret and even psychological trauma from such a thing. And while nobody said dating = sex, it does tend to go hand in hand and the risks of sexual-related issues increase when dating starts. Kids can \u201chang out\u201d without it being a date. Dating culture is incredibly problematic in many countries. We start teaching kids from a young age through our words, through media, movies, etc. that happiness lies not in themselves but in \u201cfinding someone and procreating.\u201d Is it any wonder that kids are dating younger and younger, but that happiness levels aren\u2019t increasing? It\u2019s a fallacy. IMO, parents who try to encourage their children to hold off on dating until they are older are doing the right thing. \n\nAlso, as a general \u201clook at the irony\u201d remark to commenters in this sub\u2026 it\u2019s kind of \u2026 ironic to complain about people marrying too young and making huge decisions too young in life and also complain about parents trying to prevent their children from dating too young. I cannot be the only one to see a correlation between age when dating starts, age when sex acts are done, age when married, and/or age when first pregnancy occurs. \n\nHonestly, the entire concept of adult (or nearly adult) children claiming their parent \u201cgot permissive and lazy\u201d or complaining about being \u201cGuinea pigs\u201d is annoying and shows immaturity. I refuse to call this parent an AH. I think the kids are being AHs for wanting their younger siblings to suffer as they did, for accusing their parent of favoritism rather than acknowledging their parent is human and admitted to making a mistake, and for being bitter about being \u201cGuinea pigs\u201d as if every child isn\u2019t essentially a giant experiment for a parent.", "Yup.

I saw how my older sisters were treated as teenagers vs how I was treated versus how my younger siblings were treated.\n\nTrust me when I say, this can create longstanding resentment. REGARDLESS WHAT YOUR INTENT IS this sort of disproportionate response to parenting really messes with the kids heads. It has nothing to do with \"how come I didn't get to do X when I was their age\" and it's 100% viewed as a lack of or disproportionate amount of love and parenting.\n\nIf the younger ones recall when the older ones were this age it will also skew the world for them. Imagine being 7 years old and listening to mom/dad arguing with an older sibling because they won't let them go on a date or do XYZ. Then when you're older but not even as old as the older siblings, suddenly the rules change. We can all agree kids are shitty to each other and siblings can be the worst, even the \"good ones\". And I just know there will be some level of insinuation or outright claims that mom/dad love me or them mote etc etc. Doesn't make it true, doesn't make it right, but kids are kids and they see the world in a much more black and white scenario with less forgiveness for the fact that you're also a human and learning how to do this parenting thing.\n\nI see two solutions to this. Either you do something big to make it up to your older kids. Show them you're sorry for being a jerk and making a mistake as an older parent. I can't tell you what that gesture looks like, but it needs to be pretty massive. From their perspective, you're going back on rules and promises you made during formative years of their life, that to them that constitutes nearly 25% of their entire existence. Think big heartfelt apology dinner just you and them where you outline the dinner was to apologize but this following gesture is to cement how you feel badly about the disproportionate parenting. Then I dunno, pay for a spring break trip or something. Needs to be meaningful without breaking the bank.\n\nOr you apologize to everyone and maintain your rules. The younger one got a freebie and that's that. The older ones I'd take to dinner again just you and them to apologize and outline how you heard their concerns and agree that maintaining a fair household is best.\n\nYou've already stated that you found the policy to be wrong so start looking at ways of making it up to them. I can't emphasize enough that you do not want them going throughout their young adult lives resenting you for something so stupid. Just because they may be 25 doesn't mean they are full fledged adults. They are still growing mentally and emotionally and do not realize yet just how much you as parents care for them. What was a stupid argument at age 15 has fostered and been blown out of proportion in their heads and whole it should be laughable water under the bridge today is instead a reason they choose to exclude you from major life events. \n\nI did not have the best relationship with my father. And whereas he knew this and he tried so hard to remedy things when I was a young adult. The resentment I had for all the missed events and empty promises when I was younger when he was running his own business and working long hours. Well he passed away from Leukemia and it happened the year I joined the military at age 24. Due to 11 months of training I was not able to get away to see him while he was sick. I fully regret not answering the phone to talk to him all those years during college and ignoring his requests to see me. He realized that how he was in our lives growing up was not sufficient and he wanted to be a good father and make it up to us. Due to dozens of shitty meaningless arguments as teenagers the marching orders were always ignore dad now that I'm a free adult.\n\nDon't replicate this scenario good sir.

You know what I forgave my parents for? For stuff they apologized for, even if it was spanking, etc. You know what I still resent them for even at 30 something? The stuff they blew off because they thought it was just me being a teen. You know what I brought up constantly and fought about as a teen? The sheer and utter favoritism towards my younger brother. I couldn't do things because I was a woman and he could. He had more freedom. They never apologized or acknowledged they favorited him. I have no relationship with my brother. So. You know what I did in college to get some of my \"youth\" back? Well one, I went to my hometown college because my parents said they would never help with rent. So in college I'd skip classes (mostly in freshman and sophomore year), I tried not to show that I drank at parties etc. My brother? He went to a different college and my mom would help with rent. Stuff like that. Yeah you grew as a parent but only for your younger kids. You still very much suck ass to the older ones and have not grown as a parent. For all the parents out there. You don't want your older kids to resent you for you growing as a parent and as an adult ? Apologize and do something to make up for it. I bet you guys still resent your own parents for shit they never apologized for when you were younger even if you guys are parents now. Remember how it was to be a kid, don't ever forget that.", "NTA you learned form your \u2018mistakes\u2019 so you could be a better parent. Yup your oldest are made, explain they people don\u2019t come with instruction manuals and you did what your parents did with you, because that is all you knew at the time.\n\nAll kids are born into different families, the oldest in an only child until number two comes around and changes the whole family and so on. You did the best you could with what you had.", "Why did the older children have to suffer first for him to learn from his mistakes? It's so selfish", "Did you apologise at all?", "Just let your older kids know they weren't guinea pigs and you were new to being a parent, you're sorry that they felt a need to be secretive and you tried to be the best mom you could be. You don't favor your younger kids but you want to be a better person. Im gonna say NAH your kids aren't assholes because they are reasonable upset about the different way that they were raised, and you're not an asshole either, just a person trying to learn from their mistakes and be better. Explain that to your oldest kids and things will work out", "did you actually apologize to them? not just for those rules but for all the situations they ended up in cause they were sneaking around because of your rules that now you are not enforcing anymore? Did you do something to make up for it? i mean i don't think you can but did you at least try?", "You're making the exact same mistakes with a different coat of paint.", "Literally. Am currently \u201cno contact\u201d with my father right now and would open the door again immediately with nothing short of a sincere apology. Which I thoroughly deserve. And he knows it. \n\nBut instead he has harassed everyone *else* in my life to try and guilt *them* into convincing *me* to speak to them (all of them refused). \n\nBut has he reached out to me himself? Not one single time.", "NTA. All older kids are guinea pigs. We realize that eventually. I would love for my parents to apologize and acknowledge their mistakes, but they don't. \n\nYou, however, can and need to. Sit the oldest down and explain that humans lessen from their mistakes and you are an imperfect human.  You never intentionally meant to hurt them, but you didn't get it quite right and learned from your experience. Ask them if they think they could be perfect parents. Are they really sure they wouldn't make any mistakes?  Wouldn't they want to do better next time?\n\nAsk them what you can do together to make up for the misunderstandings.  Maybe you can spend a day together, no younger siblings, and affirm to them that they're important to you and you're committed to continually improving your relationship & learning and growing together.", "NTA. I would say that you should make sure to really hear your older children\u2019s complaints and come to them from a place of understanding. Your older kids obviously have strong feelings regarding the situation and it would be good for your relationship with them to give them the opportunity to vent frustrations and (hopefully) come to a mutual understanding of the current situation.\n\nDefinitely NTA though for learning from your prior experiences in parenting and finding new methods which allow for more open communication with your younger kids.", "NTA. Your older kids feel upset and that's fair, but they really haven't reached a stage of maturity yet to realize that parenting is hard and the best you can hope for is parents who love you and are trying to do what's best for you. I come from a 7 child family, and the difference between my youngest brother and my childhoods is enormous. I was homeschooled all the way through, he is being public schooled. I barely watched TV as a child, he was watching baby einstein from the time he could sit up. I got spanked with a wooden spoon, he wasn't spanked. I'm old enough and mature enough to be glad whenever my parents have improved their parenting choices for him, while still having some grief at times for the things I endured. As a parent myself, I also feel like I have a much better understanding, even if I still don't agree with many of their choices past and present. It's hard to parent well and to know what to do if your own parents had deep issues (the further I dig into the family tree, the more I realize that these problems are generational), and so I try to have grace for my parents.", "YTA. You\u2019ve learned and are doing better, that\u2019s something not enough parents do so I would say that\u2019s admirable. You\u2019ve acknowledged that you made mistakes, also good. But have you also acknowledged the harm that was caused? Do you acknowledge the fact that years of whatever those mistakes were aren\u2019t going to go away easily just because you\u2019re doing better with their siblings? I\u2019m happy for you that you\u2019ve learned and continue to so but what are you doing to take accountability towards the older kids? By treating the younger siblings better you\u2019re doing part of the work but by saying \u201cWell I\u2019ve made mistakes but I\u2019ve learned and that\u2019s why I\u2019m treating your siblings better\u201d you\u2019re leaving the part of the work that\u2019s equally important: doing better now with the older siblings. By naming the mistakes you made, naming the harm it caused them, asking them what they\u2019ve experienced, what they missed , in which ways they felt harmed, what they need from you now, what kind of relationship they want from you now, how you can show up for them, etc.", "NAH It's probably good that you're not repeating the same mistakes. But your kid is right, you were using them as guinea pigs, and I don't think there's any way they won't be mad at you. They're only human.\n\n I'm grown up now and my mom sometimes will admit she didn't parent well. Including having a no dating rule, in fact. It doesn't clear the air like you think it might. Because my siblings and I basically were guinea pigs, and it was shitty, and there's absolutely nothing Mom can do about it now. Parents never come to these lightbulb moments while they are still in control of their children. They're only sorry when the kids are adults and not under their thumb anymore.", "YTA, and not slightly. \n\nYou've been answering comments in this thread, but conspicuously avoid addressing any that involve you taking accountability for your prior bad parenting and/or apologizing. Even the ones that just ask whether you've apologized you ignore. I don't think that's a coincidence.\n\nYou acknowledge that your behavior was wrong, there's absolutely no reason you shouldn't give both of them a heartfelt and sincere apology. Frankly, you owe it to them.\n\n#YTA.", "YTA for not apologizing and for not admitting that on reddit when everyone is asking.", "Only kinda the AH- I am an oldest child and therefore the \u201cguinea pig\u201d. This sort of thing has happened multiple different times with different events like watching higher rated movies or getting your ears pierced etc. I know it\u2019s not the same as dating, however it is similar circumstances. The rules are plain and simple and I think that you should have taken an alternative route to dealing with this issue. For example: you can double date at 15, or you can have a partner at - age but you can\u2019t go on dates until 16. This loosens the restriction but keeps it closer to the original rules altogether while also fixing issues created by the original rule. Personally as an older child this seems more reasonable and I would be more understanding. Not sure how others would fell abt this tho.", "NTA. I'm number 3 out of 6. The older two lived with their mom. We were born between 1980 and 2005. We all had different variations of the rules, especially the youngest. \n\n My mom had the can't date til you're 16 rule. I ended following it. When the youngest sibling was at that age told them and my mom that was one rule I wish I broke. \n\nShe was surprised and pry not happy I said that. The youngest was dating in the open before 16 though. \n\nI have a 13 year old and a 1 month old. Good times. Told the 13 year old you two will see me at different stages in my life. The 13 year old got see us in our early twenties broke living in an apartment working nights without a clue. \n\nThe 1 month old gets to start out with us in our mid 30s, broke homeowners with more tools and working days with benefits a slightly better clue. That's right dental and Legit PTO. \n\nThe oldest are right. They were the guinea pigs. They're still the guinea pigs. Life advice you give them now may not bode well for the youngest. That's okay though. The world we live in changes. We change. They change.  \n\nKids also don't understand the changes their parents go through until they start reaching the same stages in their life as well.  My mom was 19 when she had me, my dad was 27. I turn 36 this year. That's something I think from time to time. \n\nRight now take it all in jest. Learn from your mistakes and be a better parent. The older kids will learn to get over in time. Just don't dredge up this argument in the future. They'll realize the attitude is dumb in 10 or so years.", "NTA the first kids are always test kids. It\u2019s just how things are. The 2nd and 3rd time around you know what works and what doesn\u2019t.  You didn\u2019t let them date boohoo. Doesn\u2019t need an apology. Physically punishing them but stopped because it\u2019s wrong =apology. Lots of people in here are literally your kids ages. Take that with a grain of salt.", "Time for attempted apology #2 to the older kids\u2026 it goes something like this\u2026\n\n\u201cKids, I\u2019m starting to understand how hard I made it for you when I held that rule and forced you to hide things from me. I already realized it was a bad choice on my part, which is why I\u2019m doing things differently now, but I didn\u2019t fully appreciate how severely my choices impacted you. I love you both very much, and I\u2019m sorry I put you through that.\u201d\n\nThis was even bigger than you realized before. And that\u2019s OK, just acknowledge it now and own it. All we can do is learn from our mistakes and love our people better. \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "Saying you made a mistake with them sounds like they are the problem. Explain to them that YOU WERE WRONG and they helped you see it so now you are trying to be better. Listen to their feelings without arguing. It\u2019s okay if they feel hurt. NTA but you need to keep talking to them", "I\u2019m significantly older than my siblings and the rules were always different for me. No ear piercings until I was 18, no phone until I was 12 (and only then because my parents kept forgetting me at sports), I was expected to do multiple sports and other extracurriculars throughout school with a 4.3 GPA. No concerts, expected to have a job at 16. I wasn\u2019t allowed to do study abroad or do any overnight school trips. The only break they gave my was in high school I was allowed to go to LA and San Diego with a friend and her mom when I was in high school for my spring break. \n\nMy younger siblings had none of that. They have both been to Europe, over night trips to Disneyland three times, and one is doing study abroad right now. It hurts. My mom and I have talked about it and she has apologized and acknowledged that I was the canary in the coal mine. It still hurts, especially because I feel like I was more responsible at that age than my siblings are and I\u2019ve missed out on so much because of those rules. I think it\u2019s an open secret about parenting because every parent does this, but it still sucks.\nOP, YTA but only kind of. I\u2019d recommend having an open and honest discussion, apologizing for expecting different things, and ask them if there is any way you can work with them to fix it or make it better. I don\u2019t know if their upset will ever fully go away, but knowing that you are willing to take responsibility for your actions and work with them might make it better.", "NAH, as an oldest sibling you eventually realize that the \u201chelicoptering\u201d that first time parents do is normal in a new setting as insane as parenthood. I don\u2019t think any effects of you being stricter with them will damage them in any way, but I can see why they would be pissed off now. My mother went berserk when she found out I drank at 15, but now laughs about my baby brother smoking pot with his friends. Parents learn from their mistakes and I think your children will understand", "Your advice isn't wrong, and I'm not an overly strict parent, but \"forced them to deceive you\" indicates how soft the world has become. Kids breaking rules are not \"forced to deceive.\" I broke rules but I didn't blame my parents. We live in a candy ass society.", "When I was almost 16 and my brother almost 15, my folks had another baby.  They knew my brother and I were miserable and pretty much hated them, so they said they were going to do everything the opposite of what they did with us.  They had actually learned their lesson and got no objections whatsoever from us.  \n\nMy sister turned into a person that everyone loves, has great social skills, and is quite successful professionally.  My brother and I have always struggled with social skills and my life in particular has not been a screaming success, but I'm still fine with it.\n\nAnyway, NTA from me, because you are turning things around.", "I find it extremely telling that you skipped over part of their comment in order to only respond to the question that didn't force you to take accountability for your mistakes.", "He literally acknowledges it. . And states he did in the post. . Read it again."]}
