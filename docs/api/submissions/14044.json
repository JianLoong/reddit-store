They could have noticed a soft preference and placed this change in rules in that pattern. Only you know that. Maybe you aren't doing any preference.

Yet I still somehow managed to be grounded through most of high school over really trivial shit because of my parent's more authoritarian parenting style.\n\nFor example: I was 23 when I got my first tattoo & my mom took it as a personal attack and lost her mind. When my brother was 20, she asked me and my sister if we wanted to chip in for our brother's first tattoo as a gift. I'll admit I didn't take that well despite being over 30. It felt like a slap in the face & it was difficult to shirk the seething resentment I felt over this blatant difference (for the record I never for a second felt angry or resentful toward my brother or had any actual jealousy. My hard feelings were solely toward my parents).\n\nThat said, I have come to grips with the fact that eldest children are inherently experimental. It literally can not be helped. That just is what it is. Yes, I still grappled with copious resentment toward my parents for raising us so differently. My childhood & teen years were spent lying to my parents just so I could have some autonomy. My youngest brother just did not experience that except for a small handful of times. \n\nI'm gonna say NAH because you did learn from your mistakes. My parents did not. They were just older, and my brother was a particularly easy kid. He technically started out with the same rules but was almost always eventually allowed a lot of leeway with them.

At some point, she needs to come to grips that yes, she was the experimental child, and that just is what it is. She has to figure out how to work through that now as an adult. But you need to understand how deep these things cut, how difficult it is to just get over even as an adult.

If she explained and said sorry.\n\n\nThat's it. Explain it really well to them. Sit them down. And most importantly, apologize. You made a mistake, but it wasn't completely harmless for them. Also,  you have pointed out in other comments, that this ISN'T because he's a boy. Explain that too to them. Take it from me, that's EXACTLY what they might be thinking. I know I do with my mother.  Explain and apologize, and from now on, don't treat them differently in future matters. \n\nAnd OP, this is what every parent does. The elder ones will always be their trial pieces. Just please try to do better as you move forward.\n\nNAH if you apologize.", "Did you apologize to the oldest?\n\nMaybe explain that you did your best with the knowledge you had and you're trying to learn from your mistakes. Also ask them if they think there's any rules currently in place that need to be looked at as well because they need some benefits of your change of heart as well", "NTA. I'm different with my third kid then I was with my two oldest. Ages are 12, 10 and 3.5. I've learned and matured as a parent. I once heard somewhere it said like this (it may have been a stand up joke but it's true): kids are like pancakes. The first one or two you may not get it right bc the pan has to be just right etc. the next few come out just righ same golden color on both sides. We don't know what we're doing as parents lol we're learning on the job\ud83d\ude02", "NTA you\u2019re being honest with them they made not like it but you\u2019re telling them the truth", "Why all the Y T A?\n\nI was the oldest by a few years and because of me my younger sibling had it easier. I resented that a little for a while but I understand that my parents also learned from parenting me. Years later there aren't any hard feelings. \n\nAs parents, we do the best we can but we are so, so flawed. I've done so many things with the best intentions that ended up being the wrong thing. I talked it over with my kid and explained my reasoning and gave apologies where appropriate. \n\nOp could have talked it over with the elder kids. But they didn't and so what? I'm not saying they're perfect, but that doesn't make them an AH. It seems like in this sub if you don't do anything perfect you are labeled an AH. OP learned from their mistakes and created a better way of parenting. \n\nHere is someone trying to do right by their kids and getting called an AH because in a perfect world they could have done a little better. Some people here need to do an AITA with their own lives. Nobody lives up to these standards of doing everything perfectly.\n\nNTA. Good on realizing your mistakes Op and making a course correction.", "The thing is you aren't going to win, because your rule ridiculous and unreasonable and they did have to live with it. You need to accept and acknowledge how their lived experience is very different because of your decisions, apologizing for a bad rule, but underline that taking it out on their siblings is unacceptable. Their conflict is with you, not the younger kids.", "Did any of the Y T A posts READ the FULL posting?? Everything y\u2019all are claiming OP needs to do, he clearly stated he did it in the post. NAH, you\u2019ve learned from your mistakes, you explained this to your older kids, you communicated this with your older kids.", "He said exactly that.......that he has realized he needed to change his parenting and explained it to them.\n\nThe older kids then accused him of using them as guinea pigs.\n\nWhat is a parent supposed to do continue with a bad parenting method just so all the kids are equally screwed up?\n\nOr change his parenting method to avoid repeating the same mistakes.\n\nAnd unless I missed something no where does he disclose the gender of the oldest two.", "Right. I do not know why OP keeps arguing with them. Own up to the mistake and move on.\n\n\"Look, I hear you guys and understand why you are upset. I fucked up when it came to how I handled dating with you guys and if I had a time machine I would go back and do things differently. I was wrong but I learned from that. It would be unfair to impose the same rule on your brother and sister. I know better and want to do better and I am sorry you guys missed out on that.\"\n\nYou can not change what was done and should not parent the same way just because it keeps things fair but acknowledge the mistake and apologize for it.", "Would you rather parents not learn from their mistakes and do better with subsequent children?", "He should apologize not try to explain. He's already done that and it just sounds like he's trying to tell them he was right to do that to them if he won't apologize to them.", "But he hasn\u2019t apologised", "I agree. I'm leaning towards NAH because the older kids are CERTAINLY in the right for their childhoods! Being in a big environment where everyone around you is acting \"normal\" while you have a giant list of no-no's MUST have been hell! But OP suffered greatly from generational trauma and learned her terrible past behavior from THEM. Every time she's accepted and fixed her past mistakes with her younger kids, the oldest are coming back with \"well, good for THEM\". It's a cruel cycle with no real winners.", "YTA because you need to APOLOGIZE. My parents did this to me vs my younger siblings and I resent them so much because they will never admit it, and apologize. It hindered me socially, created a deceitful environment, taught me to hide from the people I should be closest to, made me distrustful, and myriad other issues that I still have to work through with a therapist. Like it or not, you may have affected them long term. What kind of personality do you think it creates when you push your children to lie and hide? What kind of relationships did you set them up for in the future? Do you know how many unsafe and abusive situations I and other kids raised like me put ourselves in because we hadn\u2019t been taught to have healthy relationships?\n\nYTA because you\u2019re not realizing they\u2019re not just mad about dating and curfews, they\u2019re probably upset about a pile of bullshit they can\u2019t even put into words. Cool you\u2019re correcting yourself, but you probably already ruined the first few pancakes.", "This kind of makes it worse in their eyes. You do realize girls are often held to a higher standards in boys and now it\u2019s just looks like favoritism.\n\nThe best way to handle the situation would\u2019ve been to sit and talk to your older kids and ask them what they thought of the rules. Then tell them you thought the rules were not working the way they were supposed to and that you were thinking of ways to change them for the younger kids and that you\u2019d like to input. This would give them a heads up about the fact that things are not going to work in the same way and it would make them feel as though they participated in changing your style of parenting for the better without making them feel like guinea pigs.\n\nFor future reference talk to them first, ask for their input make them feel involved so that they understand that they are not just experiments. Older kids are definitely very sympathetic and tend to want to make things better for their younger siblings. But simply changing your mood of parenting for the younger sibling without giving an explanation to the older siblings is extremely painful to experience. It feels unfair and unjust and they often feel like they never got the good version of you.", "He doesn\u2019t seem to have apologised, I don\u2019t blame them", "Bot", "Hes not willing to apologize to his kids. That makes him an asshole. does he really think it was an mistake if he just keeps defending himself and won't apologize?", "But they're *not* favoring the boy. There's a girl that's younger as well, she just hasn't reached an age where dating is a thing.", "Why are refusing to answer if you apologized to your kids.  I've seen a lot of people ask you this", "Which is why it's important to stop and reassess you beliefs when challenged. Most parents are 20-30 years out of date when it comes to experiencing childhood/schooling. So when a kid pushes back against something and calls it unfair take the time to hear them out and reevaluate. Maybe your position is sound. Maybe it's not. But drawing a line in the sand and digging your heels in when challenged isnt good patenting.", "I don't believe he needs to.  He didn't harm his children. He believed one thing before and now he thinks differently. His older children were initially just upset that he was \"favouring\" the younger ones.

You can never be too careful about that kind of thing!", "Yeah, but people dont like when you point out that they're doing unhealthy shit in regards to kids because there are parents out there that will buy big starbucks coffee for their kids too.", "Is this a joke? Because the health benefits of coffee are absolutely being debated. Consensus actually is that a couple cups of black coffee per day is pretty good for you.", "Ahh cool my best friend was molested for 4 years by her best friends big sister through middle school at sleepovers. The parents were best friends, house full of women too.
