They could have noticed a soft preference and placed this change in rules in that pattern. Only you know that. Maybe you aren't doing any preference.

To realize your parents are subconsciously favoring the boy? How is any of this redeemable?", "I realized it around the time my second child turned 16. \n\nOther things have come out since (and made more sense in hindsight) that proved there needed to be a change.", "The OP said they did in the last part of the post.

But I 100% understand my parents today.", "I'll join in as the eldest sister. YTA, OP.", "Yeah, that\u2019s just not how parenting works out most of the time. You think you are doing the right thing for the right reasons, but every kid is different and the world changes.", "The children said it tho not him.", "I mean, ALL kids are kind of guinea pigs because you learn as you go... the first guinea pig just has the least experienced 'scientist' to work with!

If they perceive that your rule change is based on gender, they will understandably be extremely angry with you.\n\nYou also never said in your post that you actually acknowledged to them that you were overly protective  and offered some sort of apology.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that you have effectively communicated with them on any of these issues and as the adult, that is your responsibility to take the lead.", "I'm glad you realized that what went wrong with your parenting. \n\nBut did you apologize to them? Tried to make amends? \n\nThey're resentful and understandably so", "Have you apologised to your older children?", "Why did you take around 10 years to realise\u2026\n\nNo wonder your children feel too little to late.", "You need to actually apologize.  Good parents admit their fuckups.  You've admitted that to us more than your kids.", "... justifying yourself after being confronted about a change a behaviour is not what I meant...\n\n\n\"My oldest two found out....\" \n\n\nEven as my older brother is only 2 years older, they told him how and why the rules for me adjusted as I reached  his age milestones. And no- not all were to my favor/ allowing me more. \n\n\nAt the time we both found rule changes unfair and shitty, but atleast my brother had not to just find out and looking back I get a lotnof their decisions.... and with others I tease them to this day :)", "Oh man okay, that helps give me perspective on the situation. I would say ESH because your 2 oldest are grown adults. \n\nLook, YTA because it is shitty to be an authoritarian parent and then change to a more relaxed parenting style as you get older. But honestly that\u2019s just how it is, I feel like A LOT of parents do this and it makes sense. But your oldest kids are valid in their feelings.\n\nHowever, they are grown!! I am literally a 27F, I am the oldest of 5 kids (my 2 youngest brothers are 15&16) and my parents were complete dictators. There are a lot of factors involved- they had me a teenagers so they were young and didn\u2019t want me to become a teen parent, they both had abusive/hard childhoods, we were poor and they kept having kids, my dad is Latino so there are some cultural expectations there, etc. When I would visit my fam in college I would be SO PISSED when my brothers were watching pg-13 movies (they weren\u2019t 13 yet!), my sister got to wear 2 piece bathing suits (I wasn\u2019t allowed until I was 17!) and they didn\u2019t get smacked if they cussed (I would have never cussed in front of my parents as a teenager but still!). But I was so young and felt it was really unfair. As the years have gone by I am really happy that my siblings have had so much more freedom than I did, and they are much closer to my parents than I ever was as a kid. I cannot imagine getting upset about the different dynamics now- but I do joke about how my parents are too old and tired to keep up with their strict rules from my childhood haha\n\nOldest siblings are Guinea pigs unfortunately\u2026 hopefully by keeping the conversation open and honest your oldest 2 will come around. Hopefully they will be able to remember what it was like having strict parents and not want that for their younger siblings.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s really sweet and supportive you\u2019re letting your 13 yo \u201cdate\u201d- it will lead to open communication later on. I NEVER talked about boys to my parents because they were NOT allowed. I snuck around and lied instead. Just make sure to keep it consistent when your youngest is a teenager because parents being more strict on daughters is totally a thing!", "So you didn\u2019t have any self reflection between 27 turning 13 and 25 turning 16 about your rules but you do the second your son turns 13? Huh.", "Good for you but OP\u2019s kids don\u2019t have to feel that way", "As the youngest sibling, YTA. Stuff like this breeds resentment and can damage sibling relationships.", "Tritto. YTA", "Right? I can't believe I was letting my older daughters go to sleepovers and hang out at the mall all day with their friends at 12/13.

The mans not here asking if he was the asshole in raising his older kids. In fact, he openly says he messed up with them. \n\nHe's asking if he's an asshole for improving with his younger two. Fundamentally - if it's YTA then you're telling him the right thing to do was maintain his strict rules for his younger kids. It's not possible to tell him he's the asshole for changing his rules while believing he changing the rules was good for the younger kids.\n\nHe's NTA for recognizing the mistake, acknowledging it openly, and improving.", "That's a good point. There are things they were allowed to do at younger ages than I would allow the younger kids. \n\nThey were allowed social media when they were 13/14 because we didn't realize how unhealthy it is. They were also allowed more freedom in activities.", "In some ways they have more freedom. The younger kids have never been to a sleepover and definitely aren't going to be allowed on social media any time soon like they were.", "I fully realized the problem when my younger daughter turned 16. Certain incidents also made a lot more sense in hindsight with my oldest as well.", "You he should put his younger children in danger because he made a mistake with his elder children?", "You cannot stop conflicts from happening between siblings. You have to approach those conflicts however. You cannot treat your children all the same because they all are individuals but by treating them different you may cause a conflict. That does not mean that you should not treat them different.\n\nI hope that collection of words is not too wild btw.", "But what do u want him to do? Do the same mistake with all his children and not learn from his earlier bad parenting? Have the same rules that he had years ago? Like the child in question is 13 ...the older 2 are already out of the house from what I understand. Times change, so do people and rules as well...\n\nYou guys call him an A for doing a better job as parent.\n\nI do think he needs to talk and apologize to his older children but he seems apologetic already and trying to do better but that only makes them feel worse...\n\nOkay maybe they need therapy\n\nEdit: \"Family Therapy\" not just for the older ones....", "I agree that the issue of gender is important - and I already raised this in my own judgement comment. But changing parenting styles / rules does not make someone the \u201cbiggest AH\u201d; it makes them human for making mistakes and then (hopefully) learning from them.", "... I hardly can respond the fiction you made up about what I wrote... lol", "No he\u2019s an asshole because he completely disregards the fact that his older children feel slighted by him in the way he treated them vs how he treats his younger kids. All he had to do was apologize but he got defensive and now he\u2019s probably just driven that rift deeper.", "Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Social media is really something that needs to be monitored. The no sleepover thing seems strict to me (my mom was strict about which friends house I had sleepovers at but she did allow it) but I grew up with a lot of friends who were only allowed to sleepover at their cousins houses so I get it. Every family has different rules!", "Have you apologised to your older kids?", "Dude that\u2019s still too little too late! That\u2019s what, four or five years?\n\nYou didn\u2019t pick up on any lies or dangerous situations till the second your second daughter turned 16!? In perfect time for you SON to be allowed to date? \n\nAnd have you apologised to the older two or not?", "Did I say that? Your an asshole for doing that to your older children in the first place.", "You can make them worse by treating them differently", "As I\u2019ve said in my comment, he watched his older children lie and didn\u2019t change but changed for his son to have more easy rules.", "When I was growing up sleepovers were common so I didn't think anything of it. \n\nMy younger kids' mother is very aware of crime statistics and doesn't come from a culture where it's normal, so she was really against it. Once we talked about it, I came around to her view, but by then the older two were not only already teenagers but also had a trusted friend group, so I decided to just let it go with them. \n\nIf I had known then what I know now, the older kids wouldn't have been allowed it either.", "Yes, you basically said that.", "So if you made a mistake with your first child you have to repeat that mistake with all following children?", "Yeah but u realize that between 27, 25 and 13 is a really big age gap ...like double the age. Look at OPs comments it's not just that \"now its a boy who is allowed to date at age 13\" but that Op actually changed his old fashioned view that were stupid and wants to do better.\n\nALSO teenagers lie all the time. Back when they were teens it was the early 2010s such views on dating were not uncommon and because he **found out later** that they lied he realized that he only made a mistake with gate keeping relationships. Times change, like the older were allowed unsupervised internet access but his younger ones will get stricter access to such things because Op thinks young children shouldn't be exposed as teenagers.", "I just explained myself", "An apology would go a long way dude.", ">I do think he needs to talk and apologize to his older children but he seems apologetic already and trying to do better but that only makes them feel worse...\n\nLike I said in my earlier comment.", "Fair, but all of his replies imply he hasn\u2019t so I still think he\u2019s an asshole"]}
