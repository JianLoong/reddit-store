My husband and I worked hard to raise them and get them to be productive adults.  And they are\n\nI am proud of all three. They were great kids and have become pretty good adults if I do say so myself.  \n\nWhen my oldest daughter married a widower who already had a two year old child my husband and I put money into an education fund. We did the same for every biological grandchild.  \n\nWe know a little bit about investing and compound interest.  By starting early we can invest a little bit each month and by the time they graduate high school we are able to provide each one with enough money for a good start in life.  \n\nMy oldest grandchild just graduated from high school.  We were able to let them know that after scholarships and everything were taken into account they would be graduating debt free.  \n\nWe don't give any of them the money.  We pay for tuition and fees and such.  We learned our lesson from our youngest, our only son.  We gave him the money like we had for his two older sisters.  He had scholarships as well.  But he blew through the money we gave him and chose to become a tradesperson instead.  \n\nHe does very well and now owns his own successful business.  He was married but it didn't work out. We have two grandkids from that marriage. \n\nLast year he married a very nice woman who has a 15 year old son. She had him very young and it caused a rift in her family.  None of them came to the wedding.  \n\nMy son approached us about money for his stepson's education.  After my husband and I discussed it we said that we could afford to give him $5,000 to help out but that was it.\n\nMy son is very disappointed. He knows that all my other grandkids have enough money in their accounts to pay for at least two and a half years of in state tuition and expenses.  \n\nHe makes good money but he also likes to spend it on toys and vacations.   I don't think that him or my daughter-in-law have anything put away for his stepson. That is why we offered the $5,000.  \n\nMy son and his wife are planning ahead for when he graduates in June. And they are still complaining that I am treating him different from our other grandkids.  \n\nI know that we are. But we didn't have almost two decades to save for him.  That $5,000 came out of my fund for when I need to replace my car.\n\nEdit\n\nMy son and daughter-in-law are not spending their money on toys and vacations. I may have put that badly.  The reason that my son doesn't have a lot of savings to pay for his son's education is because of how he chose to spend his money prior to getting married.

You offered what you could put together on short notice, which is what this was. If your son wants to complain about it, he\u2019s TA.", "NTA. You've saved up money for all of your other grandchildren (bio and bonus) for as long as you've known them, it's kind of an AH move to ask you to save the same kind of money in only one year. It's very generous to offer him $5000.", "NTA, your son is being entitled and doesn't even deserve the 5k. Btw, give the money to the kid when he is completely separated from his parents or he'll never see it", "Nta, this is weird. He only married this woman last year yet expects his parents to fork over large amounts of money to a child they aren't related to nor know? What happens if they divorce? This is a logistical nightmare in the making.", "NTA, but not because it's bio or stepsons, just that it's a late arrival and you didn't have the opportunity to save over time and build up to where you could give more. \n\nAgree that son's profligate nature kind of has nothing to do with it, other than that it's kind of cheeky for him to expect it vs. a conversation about it.", "NTA. Your son remarried a woman with a 15 year old child a year ago, and he's expecting you to pony up the costs of college because they blow all their cash on vacation and toys. There's so much with what your son is expecting you to do. \n\nJust because he's married to his mother, doesn't necessarily mean that his step son is accorded all the same privileges and perks as the rest of the grandchildren. You've had a lifetime (theirs) to save for the other grandchildren. You've known this young man for what? 2-3 years? \n\nAlso, your son and daughter-in-laws poor financial planning shouldn't be your problem to deal with. My hubs is in the trades, he makes a very nice wage but we don't go spending it willy-nilly on vacation and toys. We save. We plan. We budget. Your son obviously didn't learn when he blew all his college money.", "NTA , no one is entitled to anything and it's your choice , besides  if he doesn't want to save up to give his stepson money , why should you?", "NTA - You spent a long time building up those funds and your son is out of line expecting you to just magically conjure up the same amount of money for another child.  In this kind of situation, \"treating differently\" is handing bio kids a dozen Christmas presents and giving stepchild a $5 McDonalds gift card or some such.  He supposedly had grandparents--would your son have been as upset if those grandparents had not forked up money for a bio child of his?  It works both ways.", "NTA. Your other grandkids had the benefit of *years* of cumulative savings and interest. \n\nIf you were really wealthy and could afford it, I'd say you should help this kid the same way you helped the others. But that's not the case.", "NTA\n\nIt's one thing when grandparents dismiss a stepson that their kid has been raising as a son.  But this kid joined the family at 15.  5,000 dollars is very than generous and can definitely help with books and supplies.\n\nYou are in a no-win situation OP.\n\nIf you take money out of the other grandkids' college fund to pay for the stepson, that will cause strife with your grandkids.  If you don't, that will cause strife with your stepson.", "NTA\n\nNot the child's fault that his parents didnt put money aside for him, but also unrealistic and unfair to expect you to make up for the shortfall.  And even if you are willing to help out, your son should realize that (1) you had a lot more time to build the college funds for your other grandkids and (2) his stepson is very close to the age where he will need the funds soon.\n\nI think your $5000 contribution is very generous, and he should not feel sleighted by this.  If he is, he is being unrealistic and greedy.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a completely different situation. Even if you had been saving the entire 2-3 years for this child, it may not have much more than the $5k if at all. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a difference in the amounts. Your son should understand that. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to help, you just did not have the time to build up an account like you did with the other grandchildren. \n\nAlso, you are pulling from private money that was saved for something else so that you can help. You\u2019re making a fair effort and doing the best you can. Your son was the one who agreed to take the child on as his responsibility. He should have started saving for his stepson instead of expecting you to provide a large amount of money. There\u2019s a considerable difference in being able to stack money over a 17-18 year period than 2-3 years. \n\nYou can try to sit him down and explain this. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s willing to accept it though as he\u2019s acting more out of entitlement and expectation than reality. You\u2019re offering something just like you did for the other grandchildren. Unfortunately, you didn\u2019t have the time to make a larger contribution like with the others.", "NTA it\u2019s simply a time issue, every other grand kid had the benefits of compound interest over their entire life, this new step grandkid came into your life at 15 so he unfortunately doesn\u2019t get that benefit. A 5k lump sum is already generous.", "NTA you have no obligation to give them a dime. Your son might not like it or think it's fair but the kid is already 15. You slowly deposit money for the others I can't believe he would have the audacity to ask you for that large of a sum of money and thinkit was equal.", "NTA.  Does your son know that you are using your personal savings to help him out?  If so then he is the AH for taking it.  He has his own business. And he took on the responsibility for that boy when he married his wife.  It is unfair of him to expect the same level of funds for a child you have known for one year as compared to all their lives.", "Nta\n\nIt's very nice of you to pay for your grandkids education.  However they need to step up and be responsible.  You have had years to plan for all the other children since birth or 2 years old. 5000 is very generous. \n\n\nI cannot fathom why your son would prioritize toys and vacations over his step sons education.", "NTA.  If I'm reading this correctly, this isn't you treating a grandkid any differently.  You've had many years to save up for the other kids and only maybe 2-3 years of knowing the stepson.  Your offer of $5000 was very generous and your son should be grateful that you are willing to do that for his stepson.", "YANTA by any means.  You had YEARS to save for the other kids, and you didn't HAVE to do that, by the way.  He suddenly wants you to give this one the same amount of money in approximately 7 months or so? And for a child that I'm sure you're fond of, but have hardly had a lifeling relationship with.  He is being pretty unreasonable, and I personally find your $5K offer to be generous.  Look it's \"nice\" if everyone treats Steps equally, but that's hard to do when they're introduced into the family as already pretty formed almost adults.  DO NOT lose a moment of sleep over this. You are NTA!!", "NTA.\n\nUltimately, no one is entitled to your finances. And it is somewhat presumptuous for him to expect you to fund the 15 year old that is from his brand new wife's first marriage.\n\nSon needs to be fiscally responsible and start saving some of the toy money for the kid, and not demand from you. You are entirely generous providing for the other grandkids.", "NTA , this is a different situation.  \n\nYour son and his wife\u2019s lack of planning do not make this an emergency for you.  They should be happy with the 5k, you could\u2019ve put 2k away when they married and after 2-3 years it wouldn\u2019t be any where near 5k.", "INFO - If you had had two decades to save for your son's stepson, would you have provided the education money the same as for the other grandkids?", "Definitely NTA\n\nfirst, why should u finance someone who is not from your blood ? , please I'm not trying to be mean here and second, as you mentioned that your son blew all the money and became a tradesperson and has a successful business, so why does he asking financial help from you ?\n\nIMO don't give\n\nCharitably speaking,", "In general, NTA\u2014you\u2019re justified for treating this situation differently.  You\u2019ve had basically no time to save/let the assets grow, the kid joined your family recently as a teen, etc.\n\nMy only caveat is that I don\u2019t think his parents\u2019 profligate nature is a reason to treat HIM differently.  So that reason didn\u2019t land for me. But the rest do.\n\nEta: I misunderstood what OP meant by saying that the spending was the reason they offered the $5,000.  I thought it meant it was the reason they offered ONLY 5k, not the reason the offered the 5k instead of nothing. Comment rescinded.", "NTA and I honestly think it's so cheeky to have the audacity to ask anyone to pay for their child's education. You've had years to put money away for the other grandkids he's not long turned up and your son and newly dil expect you to pay for her son's schooling. The cheek", "NTA\u2026wait? What?  The child came into your family at 15.  You have been saving for all the other grandchildren since they were born or young.  Your son has funds but does not want to spend his own money?  5000 is very generous of you.  Your son is wrong.", "NTA. I was ready to say YTA, but not at all. First, as you said, you invest early with the money you can, and the amount helps the grandkids. Also, unless the parents didn't prepare themselves for said expenses because of promises MADE BY YOU, and not what they expect is going to happen (which is not the case, since you didn't promise anything to stepsons college fund), they are not entitled to it, none of them. It doesn't matter that some grandkids got it, circumstances change.\n\nAt the end of the day, you didn't make any promises, and it is the parents responsibility to pay for their children's education. You and your husband already did your part with your kids, giving them all available means to succeed in life.", "\n>We learned our lesson from our youngest, our only son.  We gave him the money like we had for his two older sisters.  He had scholarships as well.  But he blew through the money we gave him and chose to become a tradesperson instead. He does very well and now owns his own successful business.\n\nNTA but quick PSA - trades are a sound career decision, many tradesmen make 100-200K+. In this case, sounds like he wasted a lot of money before he realized this, but too many kids are pressured into college just because parents think they need a college degree.", "Sheesh. Considering that all the other funds came from many years ago, I get why you said you can't give more than $5K. \n\nHowever, you've muddied the water by throwing your son's choices into the mix. What does his personal money management have to do with you helping your grandkids? \n\nIs it possible to start a fund now, and give what you can each year from it? Or did you consider starting a fund when they first got married and just giving it to him later in life, like for marriage or a home down payment?\n\nNTA to your specific AITA question. You are giving money, just not as much. Your son, who doesn't seem to understand where the money for the other grandchildren came from, needs a wake up call. \n\nYou could and should be doing more for this new grandchild, but your choices up to this point don't make you an asshole.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
