My husband and I worked hard to raise them and get them to be productive adults.  And they are\n\nI am proud of all three. They were great kids and have become pretty good adults if I do say so myself.  \n\nWhen my oldest daughter married a widower who already had a two year old child my husband and I put money into an education fund. We did the same for every biological grandchild.  \n\nWe know a little bit about investing and compound interest.  By starting early we can invest a little bit each month and by the time they graduate high school we are able to provide each one with enough money for a good start in life.  \n\nMy oldest grandchild just graduated from high school.  We were able to let them know that after scholarships and everything were taken into account they would be graduating debt free.  \n\nWe don't give any of them the money.  We pay for tuition and fees and such.  We learned our lesson from our youngest, our only son.  We gave him the money like we had for his two older sisters.  He had scholarships as well.  But he blew through the money we gave him and chose to become a tradesperson instead.  \n\nHe does very well and now owns his own successful business.  He was married but it didn't work out. We have two grandkids from that marriage. \n\nLast year he married a very nice woman who has a 15 year old son. She had him very young and it caused a rift in her family.  None of them came to the wedding.  \n\nMy son approached us about money for his stepson's education.  After my husband and I discussed it we said that we could afford to give him $5,000 to help out but that was it.\n\nMy son is very disappointed. He knows that all my other grandkids have enough money in their accounts to pay for at least two and a half years of in state tuition and expenses.  \n\nHe makes good money but he also likes to spend it on toys and vacations.   I don't think that him or my daughter-in-law have anything put away for his stepson. That is why we offered the $5,000.  \n\nMy son and his wife are planning ahead for when he graduates in June. And they are still complaining that I am treating him different from our other grandkids.  \n\nI know that we are. But we didn't have almost two decades to save for him.  That $5,000 came out of my fund for when I need to replace my car.\n\nEdit\n\nMy son and daughter-in-law are not spending their money on toys and vacations. I may have put that badly.  The reason that my son doesn't have a lot of savings to pay for his son's education is because of how he chose to spend his money prior to getting married. I hope that is clear now.\n\nEdit #2.  \n\nI have talked to my husband and son. My son wants me to take money from all the accounts and make one for his stepson.  We counteroffered to split the two accounts we have for his biological children into three and split the $5,000 into them.  And we will continue to contribute the accounts until they get used.  He seems unhappy with that option.", "created_utc": 1671127022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmrhgu/aita_for_not_giving_my_sons_stepson_money_for/", "score": 2016, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You offered what you could put together on short notice, which is what this was. If your son wants to complain about it, he\u2019s TA.", "NTA. You've saved up money for all of your other grandchildren (bio and bonus) for as long as you've known them, it's kind of an AH move to ask you to save the same kind of money in only one year. It's very generous to offer him $5000.", "NTA, your son is being entitled and doesn't even deserve the 5k. Btw, give the money to the kid when he is completely separated from his parents or he'll never see it", "Nta, this is weird. He only married this woman last year yet expects his parents to fork over large amounts of money to a child they aren't related to nor know? What happens if they divorce? This is a logistical nightmare in the making.", "NTA, but not because it's bio or stepsons, just that it's a late arrival and you didn't have the opportunity to save over time and build up to where you could give more. \n\nAgree that son's profligate nature kind of has nothing to do with it, other than that it's kind of cheeky for him to expect it vs. a conversation about it.", "NTA. Your son remarried a woman with a 15 year old child a year ago, and he's expecting you to pony up the costs of college because they blow all their cash on vacation and toys. There's so much with what your son is expecting you to do. \n\nJust because he's married to his mother, doesn't necessarily mean that his step son is accorded all the same privileges and perks as the rest of the grandchildren. You've had a lifetime (theirs) to save for the other grandchildren. You've known this young man for what? 2-3 years? \n\nAlso, your son and daughter-in-laws poor financial planning shouldn't be your problem to deal with. My hubs is in the trades, he makes a very nice wage but we don't go spending it willy-nilly on vacation and toys. We save. We plan. We budget. Your son obviously didn't learn when he blew all his college money.", "NTA , no one is entitled to anything and it's your choice , besides  if he doesn't want to save up to give his stepson money , why should you?", "NTA - You spent a long time building up those funds and your son is out of line expecting you to just magically conjure up the same amount of money for another child.  In this kind of situation, \"treating differently\" is handing bio kids a dozen Christmas presents and giving stepchild a $5 McDonalds gift card or some such.  He supposedly had grandparents--would your son have been as upset if those grandparents had not forked up money for a bio child of his?  It works both ways.", "NTA. Your other grandkids had the benefit of *years* of cumulative savings and interest. \n\nIf you were really wealthy and could afford it, I'd say you should help this kid the same way you helped the others. But that's not the case.", "NTA\n\nIt's one thing when grandparents dismiss a stepson that their kid has been raising as a son.

If you don't, that will cause strife with your stepson.", "NTA\n\nNot the child's fault that his parents didnt put money aside for him, but also unrealistic and unfair to expect you to make up for the shortfall.  And even if you are willing to help out, your son should realize that (1) you had a lot more time to build the college funds for your other grandkids and (2) his stepson is very close to the age where he will need the funds soon.\n\nI think your $5000 contribution is very generous, and he should not feel sleighted by this.  If he is, he is being unrealistic and greedy.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a completely different situation. Even if you had been saving the entire 2-3 years for this child, it may not have much more than the $5k if at all. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a difference in the amounts. Your son should understand that. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to help, you just did not have the time to build up an account like you did with the other grandchildren. \n\nAlso, you are pulling from private money that was saved for something else so that you can help. You\u2019re making a fair effort and doing the best you can. Your son was the one who agreed to take the child on as his responsibility. He should have started saving for his stepson instead of expecting you to provide a large amount of money. There\u2019s a considerable difference in being able to stack money over a 17-18 year period than 2-3 years. \n\nYou can try to sit him down and explain this. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s willing to accept it though as he\u2019s acting more out of entitlement and expectation than reality.

Unfortunately, you didn\u2019t have the time to make a larger contribution like with the others.", "NTA it\u2019s simply a time issue, every other grand kid had the benefits of compound interest over their entire life, this new step grandkid came into your life at 15 so he unfortunately doesn\u2019t get that benefit. A 5k lump sum is already generous.", "NTA you have no obligation to give them a dime. Your son might not like it or think it's fair but the kid is already 15. You slowly deposit money for the others I can't believe he would have the audacity to ask you for that large of a sum of money and thinkit was equal.", "NTA.  Does your son know that you are using your personal savings to help him out?  If so then he is the AH for taking it.  He has his own business. And he took on the responsibility for that boy when he married his wife.  It is unfair of him to expect the same level of funds for a child you have known for one year as compared to all their lives.", "Nta\n\nIt's very nice of you to pay for your grandkids education.  However they need to step up and be responsible.  You have had years to plan for all the other children since birth or 2 years old. 5000 is very generous. \n\n\nI cannot fathom why your son would prioritize toys and vacations over his step sons education.", "NTA.  If I'm reading this correctly, this isn't you treating a grandkid any differently.  You've had many years to save up for the other kids and only maybe 2-3 years of knowing the stepson.  Your offer of $5000 was very generous and your son should be grateful that you are willing to do that for his stepson.", "YANTA by any means.  You had YEARS to save for the other kids, and you didn't HAVE to do that, by the way.  He suddenly wants you to give this one the same amount of money in approximately 7 months or so? And for a child that I'm sure you're fond of, but have hardly had a lifeling relationship with.  He is being pretty unreasonable, and I personally find your $5K offer to be generous.  Look it's \"nice\" if everyone treats Steps equally, but that's hard to do when they're introduced into the family as already pretty formed almost adults.  DO NOT lose a moment of sleep over this. You are NTA!!", "NTA.\n\nUltimately, no one is entitled to your finances. And it is somewhat presumptuous for him to expect you to fund the 15 year old that is from his brand new wife's first marriage.\n\nSon needs to be fiscally responsible and start saving some of the toy money for the kid, and not demand from you. You are entirely generous providing for the other grandkids.", "NTA , this is a different situation.  \n\nYour son and his wife\u2019s lack of planning do not make this an emergency for you.  They should be happy with the 5k, you could\u2019ve put 2k away when they married and after 2-3 years it wouldn\u2019t be any where near 5k.", "INFO - If you had had two decades to save for your son's stepson, would you have provided the education money the same as for the other grandkids?", "Definitely NTA\n\nfirst, why should u finance someone who is not from your blood ? , please I'm not trying to be mean here and second, as you mentioned that your son blew all the money and became a tradesperson and has a successful business, so why does he asking financial help from you ?\n\nIMO don't give\n\nCharitably speaking,", "[deleted]", "NTA and I honestly think it's so cheeky to have the audacity to ask anyone to pay for their child's education.

The child came into your family at 15.  You have been saving for all the other grandchildren since they were born or young.  Your son has funds but does not want to spend his own money?  5000 is very generous of you.  Your son is wrong.", "NTA. I was ready to say YTA, but not at all. First, as you said, you invest early with the money you can, and the amount helps the grandkids. Also, unless the parents didn't prepare themselves for said expenses because of promises MADE BY YOU, and not what they expect is going to happen (which is not the case, since you didn't promise anything to stepsons college fund), they are not entitled to it, none of them. It doesn't matter that some grandkids got it, circumstances change.\n\nAt the end of the day, you didn't make any promises, and it is the parents responsibility to pay for their children's education.

In this case, sounds like he wasted a lot of money before he realized this, but too many kids are pressured into college just because parents think they need a college degree.", "Sheesh. Considering that all the other funds came from many years ago, I get why you said you can't give more than $5K. \n\nHowever, you've muddied the water by throwing your son's choices into the mix. What does his personal money management have to do with you helping your grandkids? \n\nIs it possible to start a fund now, and give what you can each year from it? Or did you consider starting a fund when they first got married and just giving it to him later in life, like for marriage or a home down payment?\n\nNTA to your specific AITA question. You are giving money, just not as much. Your son, who doesn't seem to understand where the money for the other grandchildren came from, needs a wake up call. \n\nYou could and should be doing more for this new grandchild, but your choices up to this point don't make you an asshole.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm so sorry you've been made to feel bad about yourself here, but it's just not true. \n\nBig hugs", "NTA \n\nYou had time to save up for the others unlike you do for your new 15 year old grandson. So all you can muster up is that $5,000 and that\u2019s better than nothing. At least you\u2019re willing to give that much, I\u2019ve read similar posts and not all grandparents give new step grandchildren who are that old already any funds.", "NTA, replying after edit to, it sounds like you need to end the conversation and just tell them no. What they are demanding is that you match when you have had years to save up for this kid. Your son is making demands of your money and is being an asshole. He doesn't get to demand you open up your pocketbook for his new son, he is the parent and he needs to step up if he wants there to be a college fund. It just sounds like he's trying to appease his wife and trying to put the responsibility of taking care of his kid on you.\n\nAnd the conversation, you are not going to find an offer that pleases him unless you are completely willing to fuck yourself over. Don't steal from your other grandkids", "NTA, what were you to do plan for this potential child and save just in case? He is a major A H coming to you for money for a child that only cane into the family recently, this child has 2 other set of grandparents that they should be trying to hit up 1st before they come to you try to squeeze you for more. Also your offer to spilt the money from his bio kids isn't fair to them, they were counting on those funds and if you ear marked it for them it should stay that way. Offering the 5k was to much imo, counter with they got nothing as his education is the responsibility of his mother, bio dad, and now him if he so chooses but it certainly is not yours. He is being treated differently because he is different, he wasn't born into your family where you would have had years to save for him and its unfair for your son to ask that other lose so this child can gain.", "NTA - Your son screwed up once, and apparently didn\u2019t remember the lesson.  You have the right to do with your money as you please.  $5000 was more than generous.  Your son is an adult.  So is his wife.  There is a thing called school loans.  They can look into them.", "Haha 5k would change my life right now. \n\nHe's ungrateful NTA", "I come from a blended family and my step grandparents were NEVER expected to set up funds for me- and they had money. It may sound cold hearted but I wasn't their grandkid and this kid isn't either. NTA", "NTA-and $5000 is generous for someone you have known for a few years. Don't punish your other grandchildren. I mean in the end its your money, but your son's logic is so flawed it's ridiculous.", "NTA, your step grandson can take out loans for school. And if your son and his wife feel so inclined, they can pay for the loans.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve been incredibly generous and thoughtful in regards to finances. He should be grateful and instead he just seems greedy. So many people aren\u2019t nearly as blessed to have that kind of financial support yet still manage to have successful education/career futures.", "NTA I actually think you are being incredibly kind offering anything at all. Your son needs to stop with the entitlement. I hope you can teach your newest grandkid your knowledge in financing. Maybe he will learn something and hopefully he\u2019s appreciative of your offer. I wouldn\u2019t give a done to your son directly. He might be asking for money to cover up some debt or personal losses  and what\u2019s why he\u2019s taking it do personally.", "NTA\n\nHe signed up for this responsibility, not you.  He can be upset if he wants but it\u2019s not ok to take from the other kids to make his wife happy.  This is a failure of hers alone, she has not put anything away in the last 15 years.  This is something they need to work out for themselves, they should say thank you for the $5k and continue to add what they can.", "NTA\n$5,000 is very generous. They can help him look into scholarships and financial aid.  What about the child's bio father? Did he and the bio mother save *anything*? For their kid?  I don't agree with the compromise that you split the other two kids funds into three. Thats not fair to them.  Your son, and his wife can learn how to budget WAY better in order to give that kid a bigger fund instead of expecting you to put up all the money.", "NTA. \n\nYou've been building those accounts since each grandchild entered into the family. You started your biological grandkids' college funds when they were newborns. You started your step-grandchild's when that child was 2 because that's when they became family. So you start this kid's fund now, as he's only just entered the family. That is absolutely fair. BTW, I only used \"step\" for timeline purposes. I love that you don't use the term.\n\nYour son is out of line. You can not penalize children whose accounts have grown over the years to appease him. Your suggestion that if any accounts are divided they should be the ones for his kids is a good, fair idea.", "NTA.\n\nYour money, your choice. Remind him of that - that life isn't a free ride paid for by everyone else.", "NTA and shut down any further attempts at negotiations. \nThis is your money. You shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad about a surprise 15 yo grandson or have to sacrifice your new car or your other non-surprise grandkids\u2019 funds. How dare he attempt to re-negotiate what you\u2019ve already had planned for years because he threw you a curve ball.", "NTA he\u2019s super entitled. This child needs to understand circumstances are different. That\u2019s like.", "NTA for your question but your condescension for someone going into tte trades when it pays a LOT for much less debt is ridiculous. Check your bias.", "Sorry if this sounds mean, but:\na) grand parents haven't had 15 years to save\nb) actually, this isn't their grandchild---he just recently appeared\nc) son did not distinguish himself with the money he himself was given by his parents, and they understandably do not trust him\nd) which would altogether be a big reason why I wouldn't take money from all the grandchildren's accounts to give to him OR this boy\ne) grandparents have done well for their children's children, but this boy just appeared, the child of a mother who hasn't saved him anything, and seriously, who knows if he'll be there a year from now?\nf) I will bet son has shot his mouth off to girlfriend, trying to be a big man by promising her a college account for her kid.", "I think \u201cfair\u201d would be to have started a fund for this step-grandson at the time of marriage and contribute to it exactly as they do to the others.  What is there at his graduation is what is available to him.  Son and DIL are getting a break in not needing to save as much (if anything) for son\u2019s 2 bio kids, so they can focus on paying the rest for him.\n\nI imagine the $5000 is more generous than what would have been saved over the last 3 years, especially with the market over that span.", "There is so much grey here. Starting a fund for a toddler that you expect to watch grow up is 100% different than a new blended family with a 15 year old. I just can't imagine my step grandparents setting up monetary funds on my behalf and they watched me grow up.", "Maybe not. Didn\u2019t catch how old bio grandchildren were, but there might be enough time to make up the funds moved from each account. OP said they plan to contribute to those accounts until they\u2019re used. It\u2019s a sacrifice for sure. But if those grandkids take after OP, we might find they are generous souls that would be happy to know they contributed to making college attainable for their new bonus brother.", "Same! My daughter got a full ride because we\u2019ve told her since elementary that she\u2019d have to rely on scholarships, grants and loans for college.  She worked her tail off to graduate with high honors and get a full ride. She also got a private scholarship that covered her books", "Good point. My own family was poor, and my siblings and I were the first to go to college. We all worked our butts off getting good grades, doing sports, working to save money, etc., so we could afford college without help from our family. OP's son can also take out loans for college. And community colleges are offering four-year degrees at low cost these days. That combined with living at home puts college within reach for many young people and their families who can't afford expensive private schools.", "It\u2019s also a lot of work to maintain them through all 4 years!", "That's awesome! Great job.", "That's right answer. $5000? Why? Op, it is your money. Why is Op's son not paying for the college?\n\nI would tell his two other kids. Don't change anything, op or other grandkids you don't know will start popping up", "Yes it is, my oldest granddaughter is a junior, and she only has two classes to take next semester to get her degree in psychology and minor in ministry. My youngest granddaughter just started college. She\u2019s a concert flutist getting her degree in education in music. They\u2019re both very intelligent and talented. I\u2019m very proud of both of them.", "Thank you! That\u2019s my first award!", "Nta. I think you are already very generous with 5k !", "NTA. Beggars can't be choosers.  Do you even know if this kid is planning to go to college or do anything at all. \n\nYou're already being generous in offfering anything", "NTA. You didnt actually saw this boy grow up as your grandson so you dont actually have to give him money. 5,000 is a generous offer, he is a full grown man who decides to be a step dad so now he has to deal with it, it is not your responsibility at all.", "OP you should also add that you will only split his bio kids account if they allow it. It isn't fair to them that money meant for them get spent because daddy wanted his daddy to pay for his wife's son.", "NTA - you don\u2019t owe your stepson anything for college. You aren\u2019t treating him differently because you dislike him, you\u2019re treating him differently because he was 15 when they married! You offered what you could afford (5000) and you offered to split between his two biological kids if your son wants that. Expecting more is unreasonable of your son. Because honestly, no one in their right mind expects you to pay for the college of a grandchild that came into your life when they were 15. You\u2019ve been incredibly generous and your son should quit complaining and thank you.", "NTA. Your son is being unreasonable", "NTA\n\nYou have only so much money coming in and it is not your fault or ability to foresee if one of your children marries a person with an older child as part of the package deal.\n\nAnd he seems a bit entitled, about wanting to take money from his nieces and nephews to where it benefits who again?  His stepson, when he and his wife are contributing what to this child's future education again?", "Wow. You are a super generous grand parent. NTA", "NTA but the real AH is your sons wife. What self respecting woman asks their in-laws for a handout? For someone who\u2019s not Ben biologically related / has been a stranger to them till very recently?", "NTA. You have been very generous. The new stepson's situation is entirely different than the other kids. As you say, you've had years to build their college funds. His own mother and bio dad should be helping him and should have had money saved for him.", "NTA. Good on you for helping your step grandson with the 5k.", "NTA - $5,000 is a huge amount of money to offer (especially on short notice) how could someone be so entitled to be upset about this kind and generous offer made for a teenager they likely hardly know", "NTA you simply didn\u2019t have the time to save for your son\u2019s stepson. You multiply money in a nick of time. Tell that to your son. It isn\u2019t your duty to provide for this boy. That you are willing to help you proofed with giving 5000 $. It isn\u2019t your other grandchildren\u2019s duty to give money for the education of a boy that came only into family last year.", "NTA, expecting to give a share of the money from the other grandkids is not fair to them either. You had time to save for each and every one of them, it's not like you're excluding the stepgrandson because he's not biologically related to you as you gave money to the other stepgrandchild but this is different. The other stepgrandchild was 2 when he entered your life, plenty of time to save up for his graduation. You're not playing favorites either, if you were, the new stepgrandkid wouldn't have gotten anything from you.", "You're already being very generous. Don't let his entitlement push you into something you can't afford.\n\nNTA", "The parents of a pop-up teen, appearing late in the game, for whom you have built zero emotional attachment, should be happy with anything you give. I don't understand the calls for \"equality\" - he's not even your grandson (not because of being a step-, but because he was so old when you met him)", "ESH YTA", "One thing I will say\u2026.stop treating him differently. That\u2019s crap. \n\nYou can work out the financial part to the best of your ability. But maybe your children have a different idea of your money situation then you actually do. It may be time to let them actually know. It may ease some tension.", "So your son picked up an instant family and your suppose to instantly pick up the tab. He already had 2 sets of grand parents that could have done this for him.", "NTA, he should be grateful that you saved for his 2 biological children. \nYou don\u2019t owe them anything & I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to take away money from his 2 kids to give to his SS\u2026.", "You\u2019ve got a ton of comments here already, but to add, you\u2019re NTA. I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re even offering your step-grandson $5K to begin with.", "I would've said _y t a_ if that stepson has been in the picture ever since he was young, but that's not the case, and your suggestion to split only your son's kids' money plus the 5k between them and the stepson is pretty reasonable. So NTA", "NTA \n\nIts your money. And hes only a stepson too. And like you mentioned he was already 15 when he joined the family.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t have time to save for this grandchild, and while you are treating him differently, it\u2019s because of different circumstances. If your son was really that upset about it, you\u2019d think he would take you up on the offer you gave him in edit #2!", "Yeah the 5000 is already super generous when he doesn\u2019t have to worry about his bio kids tuition money. He just doesn\u2019t want to spend any of his own money to his kids education \ud83d\ude44 NTA", "\"Hey! Nice to meet you!\" \"Give him a college fund equal to everyone else!\"\n\nSon wants to get his paws on money that doesn't belong to him. I suspect he won't be happy until the college funds for his siblings have been ransacked as well. NTA.", "What the F is a Bot? Thanks in advance!"]}
