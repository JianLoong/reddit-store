Her husband was never very involved in Sofia\u2019s life and Sofia was pretty much on her own. I convinced him to let Sofia move in with me and the plan was to let Sofia finish the school year/graduate middle school at her school then she\u2019d come to live with me starting that summer. I wanted to get her used to living with me so I\u2019d fly her down 1-2 weekends a month and she spent thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, and pretty much every long weekend with me. \n\nI wanted the transition to be as smooth as possible for her so when she was visiting we went to pretty much every event I could find for kids her age so she could make friends. I took her out to go swimming, shopping, laser tag, go kart racing, and anything else that she wanted to do and got her private lessons for every extracurricular activity that she was interested in. It was expensive and exhausting but it worked great. She moved in 3 days after her last day of school and she already had friends in the neighborhood and she had activities to look forward to (one that will be important is surfing and sailing lessons). \n\nMy nieces and nephews on my brothers side are going to visit for a week (I\u2019m basically the free babysitter while my brother and SIL go on a cruise) soon. My SIL called me and said that her kids are so excited for me to take them to baseball games, concerts, laser tag, go kart racing, and to do the surfing and sailing lessons. I asked what she was talking about and she said that since I was doing all of that for Sofia when she visited she and her kids assumed I\u2019d be doing it for her kids. \n\nI told her I didn\u2019t plan any of that. Sofia has school, I have work, those activities are a lot more expensive with 4 kids (sofia included), and having these visits so packed is exhausting. She asked what I\u2019m going to do with her kids when they\u2019re here and I said I don\u2019t know. I have a pool and video games at the house and we can go out once or twice but not every day and nothing too crazy. We can do the movies, maybe laser tag, maybe an escape room, but not everything she listed and definitely not the private lessons. \n\nShe repeated that I was doing it for Sofia and I tried to explain that I was trying to figure out what Sofia liked so I could get her in summer camps and after school activities (she switched from private to group lessons shortly after she moved in) but they still weren\u2019t having it. They\u2019re saying their kids are hurt because they feel like I\u2019m playing favorites and that they\u2019re not as important. \n\nAITA for not treating them the same?", "created_utc": 1682218608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vt5ia/aita_for_not_treating_my_nieces_and_nephews_the/", "score": 248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The poor girl lost her mother, I bet she\u2019d trade all of those experiences to have her mom back. You were helping her through her grief while also getting her ready for a really big move. The fact that your SIL didn\u2019t get that is kind of weird - have you talked to your brother about it at all?\n\nSounds like they will still have fun with you, and you\u2019re helping them out with free babysitting. Pretty entitled of SIL to expect so much.", "NTA SIL and Bro are entitled AHs. Maybe you should re-think the free babysitting since it\u2019s not appreciated. \n\nPS good on you for taking Sofia in, you\u2019re a great Aunt/Sister.", "Your SIL is really something. She is comparing her children with someone who has just lost a parent, and another parent being least involved?? You are essentially taking on a parental role. If anything, SIL should be offering to take Sofia out with her children. \n\nGood on you OP for stepping up. NTA.", "NTA Sophia's mum passed away and they're jealous because you were trying to cheer her up. Wtf? Plus the situation is entirely different since Sophia's visits were to get her used to moving in and not for you to just babysit. If they can't understand that withdraw your offer to babysit free of charge.", "NTA\n\nSofia is more like a foster kid or adopted kid than a niece at this point.  It would be like my sibling expecting me to do everything for my nephews/nieces that I do for my own kids.  I love them, but it isn\u2019t the same.  \n\nI know legally Sofia may not be your foster or adopted kid, but for all intents and purpose, you are the person taking care of and raising here. \n\nSide note: talk to a lawyer and make sure you have all of the paperwork you need to document your new relationship for school and govt purposes.", "NTA. Sofia is basically going to be your kid so of course she is going to be treated differently. Your SIL sounds entitled. She honestly expects you to pay all of that for 3 more kids? If your SIL offered to pay for her kids to do stuff it would be one thing, but I\u2019d have no problem telling her to fuck off if she didn\u2019t offer. She\u2019s already getting a free babysitter while she cruises, surely she can afford to chip in for some activities for her kids.", "NTA- your SIL is acting exceedingly entitled for someone getting a week\u2019s worth of free childcare. She could have budgeted for her kids extra entertainment when she was booking a cruise for herself and your brother. That is no way on you, especially already providing shelter/food/entertainment. \n\nYou are now Sophia\u2019s guardian. I don\u2019t see how that makes you fiscally responsible for every other child in your family. You\u2019re very generous and kind, please don\u2019t let them make you feel bad about not indulging their children while they spent their money on a child-free vacation. \n\nI wish you and your niece all the happiness in life.", "I mean, if they want to have everything Sophia gets, they can have an absentee father and lose their mother unexpectedly.\n\nNTA. You're basically Sophia's parent now. Obviously most people don't do as much for all of their nieces and nephews as they do for their own kid. \n\nIf your brother and SIL want you to do a lot of extra stuff, they can always pay you to take a week off work and pay for all the activities they want you to do with their kids.", "NTA. First of all, you did a wonderful thing taking in your niece like that.\n\nSecond - your SIL had no right to obligate you to do all those things for her kids without asking you first. Your niece\u2019s situation was completely different. And like you said: she was one person, your SIL is trying to obligate you to do it for 3 additional people. \n\nYou aren\u2019t playing favorites - you were becoming a parent to a child who had lost hers. The other kids still have parents, and parent who can pay for these things themselves.", "NTA. You're treating them differently because the situations are different which is perfectly reasonable. Sofia's mother died and you stepped up. You did and are doing what's right for Sofia. If the other kids feel left out or whatever then that's their parents fault for feeding them that opinion. It kind of blows my mind that your brother and his wife don't understand why it would be different. I'm sorry you're having to deal with that but you are doing nothing wrong at all. I'd have been jazzed as a kid to have an aunt that'd let me play in the pool and play video games. I don't see the problem.", "Just tell them to find a new babysitter.

You're doing a great job", "Nta, preparing to move Sofia in with you vs watching your other niblings are completely different and it sounds like sil should have sent her kids to a summer camp for the experience they all want", "NTA. Your SIL is insanely entitled. I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t agree with you taking in Sofia at the root cause, but I can\u2019t imagine why. You took in a girl whose mother died and whose father clearly didn\u2019t want her. That\u2019s a lot different than the other nieces and nephew visiting. You were investing in Sofia\u2019s future and creating an environment she felt at home in.", "NTA not even close. I'm not sure what planet SIL lives on where she can see the different situations that her kids have. \n\nThe 3 kids are old enough to understand, so if they seem a little fussy, just explain it like you did here. Mom might be saying their upset when they dont care that much.", "NTA\n\nSofia is going to live with you and you will be basically raising her. You're not raising your brother's kids. And they didn't lose a parent. SIL is lucky you're willing to babysit them. Explain to your brother -- let HIM deal with his wife. And you can explain to the kids how things work.", "NTA. \n\nI've nothing positive to say about your SIL's and brother's senses of entitlement to your time and money while they're off on a cruise, instead of, you knowing, dying. What pieces of work they are.", "NTA sofias main parent died which is so traumatic at a young age. Your nephews have both parents and are coming for a week, not moving in with you. 4 kids is very different than one and your nephews should sympathize with the fact that their cousin lost their mom and had to move to a new place and new school.", "NTA\n\nYou went above and beyond for Sofia because that was something that would benefit her when she moved her entire life from where she lived to what sounds like an new city and possibly a new state.  It was actually smart forward planning to ensure she started at her new school with as little disruption as possible\n\nBut your SIL may be an AH because sounds like she promised her kids something without checking with you first, and if she doesn't understand that you can't afford to do it for four kids, while you still have to work then that's on her and your brother", "NTA. If they want you to do those things with their kids while you\u2019re watching them then they can definitely give their eldest enough to cover these outtings for their 3 kids", "NTA but SIL...", "NTA, does everyone on reddit have dense af family members or something? \ud83d\ude29", "I don\u2019t know if it counts as playing favourites if you are setting up to be a guardian for a family member whose parent has passed away. So, NTA.\n\nThe kids might still be expecting some fun stuff, so don\u2019t compare notes, but honestly this sounds like the SIL is making comparisons so just ignore it and have a fun week together.", "You are amazing and NTA. Expecting you to do all that AND PAY is ridiculous and entitled. As you said, you are trying to figure out what she likes so of course you are exploring. They can do those things with their kids on their own time.", "NTA. The situations are SO different and anyone still playing the tit-for-tat everything has to be the same game at SIL's age is ridiculous. Your youngest nephew is 12. He is old enough to understand that different circumstances require different treatments. You'll still have fun with SIL's kids, take them out once or twice. That's PLENTY. You're babysitting for FREE and you're not obligated to do ANYTHING other than keep the kids safe, feed, clothe, and shelter them while you babysit. SIL is very entitled and needs to take a chill pill.", "NTA. Your SIL on another hand has clearly lost her mind. You do not owe anything to her kids. You doing her a favour by watching them.", "NTA -\n\nI could see the kids expecting to do some fun things - but for your SIL to expect you to do ALL those things in 1 week with all the kids as well as foot the bill for it all is absurd.  \n\nThe situation with Sophia is VASTLY different than her \"just visiting\" - you were preparing for her to live with you and trying to find out what she liked and to keep her entertained and help her through the death of mother. \n\nSince you are watching your Brother & SIL's kids while THEY go on vacation, it would be nice if they want you to do a bunch of expensive things with their kids that they offer some money to help with the costs.  Also THEY are going on vacation - YOU are working, so was she expecting you to take the week off work to watch & entertain their kids as well?!?!\n\nYou are now, in essence Sofia's parental figure - what you do with her does not have to be \"equal\" or fair with the other kids. \n\nYour SIL seriously needs to think about what she said.  Her thinking is SO off base, and I hate to say it because the word is SO overused...sigh...but she's also being \"entitled\". \n\nIf she's going to be such a b\\*\\*ch about it - you can always decline to watch them at all and let them find someone else to watch the kids.  You are doing them a FAVOR and she is TOTALLY unappreciative. \n\nI am sorry about your sister's passing and wish you and Sophia nothing but the best.", "NTA. You\u2019re raising your sister\u2019s kid. You aren\u2019t raising your brother\u2019s kids. It\u2019s entitled of her to assume that you would or even could drop that kind of money on kids you\u2019re babysitting.", "NTA. Sofia is your de facto daughter now and you wouldn\u2019t treat your nieces and nephews the same way you treat your daughter.

Also, sounds like you are doing a great job and I wish there were more like you in the world.", "You do realise any help you are planning to give Sofia for college and such, you\u2019re SIL is already expecting the same for her 3 kids..", "Could you possibly let your sister in law know that the kids could also do most of that stuff on the cruise, so they should definitely take them with them?", "Or she could offer to do it if of one of them becomes absentee and the other dies. \n\n\nI'm shocked at the staggeringly entitled and unsympathetic view point of these people. \n\nAren't they sofias aunt and uncle too??? \n\nNta op \n\nYour an amazing aunt/parent for your niece.", "If you do keep the kids over tell them your sorry their mom lied to them about what they'll be doing but they can still have fun. That she never paid for their activities or asked you if there would be time for all that.\n\nExplain Sofia's situation (if shes ok with it) and that you'll be acting as her parent from now on and wanted to make sure she settled in well in her new home. \n\nIf sil keeps being so entitled to your time or the kids throw a fit them refuse to take them.", "NTA... Very entitled SIL. I would be tempted to ask her if your brother is still alive.", "NTA Calmly remind them their kids have both parents in their lives. You are trying to be the parent in Sofia's life since the father is not that interested. What you do for Sofia isn't playing favouritsm, but PARENTING. And you are allowed to parent  any way you see fit to help Sofia grow up to be a super awesome person just like you.", "NTA \"Yes, I am treating them differently. But, sister dearest, I want you to know that if you drop dead and their father shirks his responsibilities and I end up effectively a mother to your kids, I will treat them exactly the same as I did her.\"", "NTA. Your SIL is comparing two unequal situations. It's not niblings to niblings. Ask her if your brother died and she's planning on not being available for her kids. Because that's the only way it's comparable.", "NTA. Free baby sitting while on a cruise is MORE than generous and your SIL has the nerve to expect even more? I will never understand the entitlement of some people.", "NTA!\n\nI would add up the cost for all 5 of you to go to these things, add in what wages you would lose for taking the time off work, the cost of board and lodging for the time they are with you, AND add 20% tw@t tax on top for your SIL\u2019s entitled behaviour, and present them with an invoice that needs paying before their children step foot on your property. \n\nOr they can just not go on their kid-free cruise \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Definitely NTA, I would tell her you did not realize the expectation and you simply cannot afford that so they will need to find other arrangements for their kids for the week. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t follow through, let her sweat it out for awhile.", "You have adopted your sisters daughter and are babysitting your brothers kids. The situations are not the same so your SIL is either entitled or sorely mistaken to believe that the situations are the same and if she wants her kids to do those activities while they are with you then she can pay for them. NTA. And good luck, Mumma Bear, in training", "I have the worst attitude about this kind of stuff. I'd fire back, \"Oh, ok, so one of you is willing to die while the other ignores the kids so they can all get PARITY with Sophia? Is that the game plan here?\"\n\nUgh!\n\nYou are definitely NTA", "Tell you brother to deal with his wife, or he can find a new free babysitter."]}
