It takes them 60 minutes to get home, instead of 20 minutes if they were dropped off first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy children have been on the bus for a couple weeks now and just brought this up to me.

We have a nanny who watches them until we get home.\n\nEDIT 2: For those asking why my children are \"more important\" or what issues this causes:  They get stressed over the amount of schoolwork that they have and want the extra time to complete it. They can't read/work on the bus due to motion sickness. They are more important to me, of course, but not more important in general!\n\nEDIT 3: The nanny lives in our neighborhood and doesn't have a car and we do not have a spare.

I'm curious to know why you feel like your kids deserve preferential treatment over other kids and why the entire bus route should change for your kids.", "YTA - this is hilarious. Do you seriously think you can just request that they change the whole bus route to suit you?", "YTA The heuristics of school bus routes are developed with the input of the school administration and the school bus company. The buses have to make multiple runs to the schools in the district. It's not a simple change. Have you ever wondered why school start times are staggered in a district, it's because of the number of buses, schools and student population that require transportation.", "YTA there are reasons the school/bus company chose this route. It could be because of where the bus company is located, as the drivers usually have to drop the buses off there at the end of the day. To ask the school to switch the route is entitled. To speak to the driver is just wrong, as they are just doing what they are told. If you're unhappy with the bus route, pick your kids up yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou asked and they said no.  The issue may be connecting buses or something else that you don't know about.  Why you are the arse is because you started abusing the person on the other end of the phone.  Before that it was a case of N A H.\n\nI feel you though.  It's not uncommon for buses to do exactly what you describe.  They do the route in reverse in the afternoon from the morning.  Last to be picked up is the first to be dropped off.  Because otherwise you end up going to the end of the route first before making your way back. \n\nIf your kids are the only ones from that side of the town that catch this bus, just be careful that you aren't disadvantaging your children by the bus route suddenly discovering that it's not viable to go out in your direction and you'll need to drop the kids off to a much further bus stop than the one you are currently using because it may just be easier to drive them to school then.", "YTA \n\nThats not the way school bus routes work.

After a few weeks a neighborhood carpool was formed because wtf. they changed it back the next year", "And your folks would've actually had a case. Jesus that's insane", "I'd be one of the first on and one of the very last off, like second or third to last. Took 40 minutes to get home (school ended at 2:35, got home at around 3:15, sometimes later), about an hour to get to school.", "That's how bus routes always worked for me. The bus route went one direction on the way there and more or less the exact opposite the way back.", "In our area they reverse the route. Otherwise, they would be passing kids\u2019 houses and have to double back. From a time and fuel efficiency standpoint, it makes sense. It sucks for the kids who live further out, but that\u2019s the way life works sometimes. (And growing up, I was the further out kid. Never crossed my mind to complain or ask for a change).", "I had a long ride too, to me it just meant an hour and half of only 1 adult who was busy driving so me and my friends just goofed off the whole time, we made paper games, those triangle things that \"tell the future\"\n\nI also lived in the middle of nowhere so with both parents working non really wanted to drive like 30 minutes to my friends house, so my bus time was really the only time i got to constantly hang out and see constantly outside class time and our 30ish minute lunch period", "Commented this elsewhere but you're totally ignoring all the details that go into route planning that isn't just the time kids spend on the bus. Drivers are also people. This change could result in extending their day by a lot more than 2 hours if they're say now having to take a route at a time that gets traffic heavy with work commuters. They may have a second route after op's kids get dropped off like for kids in sports and clubs. We don't know where the buses go after last drop off - maybe it's right near the school, maybe it's really far away, maybe it's the drivers house, maybe multiple drivers cover the route throughout the week or different ones take am/pm . Maybe the simple +6 min for the other 7'kids means -2 hours for op's kids but +3.5 hours for the driver plus gas use increase.", "How is that \"very common?\" Were you employed at the School District Bus Division?", "They coordinate schedules with other schools. So it makes sense to take the shortest route, and the farthest away will always be first on and first off. Look at it like this: suppose they bring a bus in all the way to the closest kids, then backtrack to the farthest point, then double back to the school? Does that sound efficient? Or what if you are one of the kids that live close to the school and you have to watch the bus drive by your home and go to the farthest point, then double back? That doesn\u2019t make sense and the school of origin is NOT the driver\u2019s next stop. Their next stop will likely be a middle school (presuming these are elementary kids) that is close to the far point of their route. It\u2019s all about efficiency.\n\nHonestly, these bus routes are *district* level decisions. The school probably couldn\u2019t even change them if they wanted to. That would be some director at the district office, who isn\u2019t going to take time out of their schedule to meet with a helicopter parent.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t get all the people calling OP an AH (other than the yelling part). Growing up, our house was one of the last picked up in the morning and also the last dropped off at night. The route in total was about an hour long, but no one was on it for 2 hours/day.", "You\u2019re assuming that all bus routes are a loop, which they are not. Some buses go from point A to point B, so reversing the route one way would mean driving by all the other kids houses to drop OP\u2019s kids off first. \n\nIf they live farthest from the school, they get picked up first and dropped off last.", "Its not \"better treatment\", the school didnt design the bus route specifically for the other kids. They just live in a more convenient location to get to school.", "It's pretty damned entitled to ask for a school district to change the bus routes for *one* family. If you have to take the bus, you have to suck up how long it takes. Would OP ask a commuter train to change its schedule? Because that's basically the same thing.", "So? Still failing to see this great injustice. The routes are optimized for a reason, not to specifically \"screw over\" OP's kids. Do they have to survey all the kids and figure out the best way to get everyone to the same average time spent on a bus?", "Yes, because they live further from the school than the other kids so. If OP doesn't like it they should move closer to the school.", "Unfortunately they just have the short straw.\n\nIt goes back to what I said, someone's gotta be first and someone's gotta be last. \n\nWhat the father wants is essentially the route to be flipped so that his kids are picked up last and dropped off first.\n\nHe wants someone else's kid to spend the most time on the bus.\n\nThe only solution really is OP picks up his kids from school. Because the school isn't going to change the bus route for 1 family.", "Yeah, and like isn't fair.  Get over it.", "I see you dodged the part on what actual hardship it was causing.\n\nThat's why YTA.", "Sure, but a lot of bus routes aren\u2019t closed circuits. When I took the bus in elementary school, we lived in rural town with a long artery road. Since I lived farther away from the school, I was among the first to be picked up and the last to be dropped off. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a way to reverse it, and dropping me off first would mean driving past all the other kids houses.", "Yes.  There may also be children with IEPs on the bus who have to have shorter rides because of medical conditions.  There are so many factors that go into a bus route, and they cannot change the route for your convenience.", "I mean, look -- you admittedly *yelled* at some poor school admin person who was only doing their job. \n\nAsking in the first place ... I kind of get it. It's definitely high up there on the entitled spectrum, but from your perspective you saw a route that didn't seem to make sense to you, and was giving your children a significantly longer ride, so you think -- why can't they change it? \n\nThe entitlement comes into play because *somebody* has to be the last person dropped off on any route. By asking to change the route, you would then be putting another child in the exact same position as your kids are now. But that doesn't matter to you because, well, they're not your kid so you don't really care. You think that your kid's needs should take precedence over any one else's. \n\nEntitled, but had you simply asked, accepted the answer, and went on your way, that would be a very mild offense. \n\nHowever **MASSIVE YTA** for your reaction to a very reasonable decision on the school's part. And if tantrum throwing when you don't get your way is your default reaction, you probably are teaching your kids the wrong thing.", "Why don't you ask the school to just skip all the other kids and just drop off yours. Maybe the driver can come inside and make them a snack too", "Get the nanny to get them , newsflash other children matter too", "oh boo boo. sounds like a first world problem", "NTA in the absence of other compelling reasons I don't see why the school couldn't at least switch either the morning or afternoon route so your kids aren't spending all that extra time on the bus. If they're old enough then a different route am vs. pm should be fine. It may confuse little ones, that's the only reason I can see.\n\nIt seems like a linear thinking kind of problem on their part (must go same way both times...) but yelling was a mistake if for no other reason than linear thinkers tend to dig their heels in. and asking the driver, yeah, probably yta but you're trying to help your kids", "Adding a mile to the route was a change.", "Depends on the route. It\u2019s pretty normal to do furthest from school to closest to school on the way in and then the reverse on the way home. It wouldn\u2019t really make sense to pass the homes of all the kids who live close to the school just so you can get the kids who live miles and miles away home a little faster. It\u2019s not efficient for time or fuel.", "Bus routes often go to the farthest out for first pick up, then work towards the school. For drop-off, it's the reverse.  The closest gets dropped first. It's not fair, but it is most efficient. I was on the far out pick up. I just did homework on the bus in the morning!", ">is normal? In my school system the one perk of having to be the first on the bus was you got to be the first off. Why is it fair the\n\nStart -> stop A -> stopB -> StopC -> school   \nSchool -> stopC -> stopB -> stopA  -> start \n\nEver take a train or public bus? That's how routes work Point A -Z in one direction and point Z-A in the other.", "A lot of this also depends on what the bus is doing after this though - are they doing a later pickup for kids in clubs and sports ? Are they returning to a lot at or near the school? Are they small buses that the drivers actually drive home ? Or do they go to a depot - where is that depot ? Switching the route may result in the bus driver's day being extended by multiple hours or cause them to get stuck in commuting traffic or use significantly more gas. There are a lot of factors that go into this", "~tennessee~ first on and last off", "The first half of high school, I lived 15 min from school in a pretty average sized suburb.  It started at 8:20 (bus arrived 8:10 sharp) and let out at 3 exactly.  I was the first bus stop, last drop off.  They picked me up at 6:37 and it was a blessing to be home before 4:30.\n\nHere's the best part:\n\nWhen they picked me up at 6:37 we just drove around aimlessly until 6:50 before picking up the next stop.  And then until 7:10 and then it was normal.  The 7:10 stop was 3 turns from my house and about a mile of distance.  The pickup order made sense, but it should be me at 6:50, stop 2 at 7, them at 7:10 and I'm being super generous with this.\n\nI told my mom about it and she called them like \"can you explain why they drive around?  is there like, a kid that just never rides and you have to stop at their house?\" (we had a few of those).  They just said \"nope, thats just the mapped out route we can't change it\" so my mom called again and set it up so if I wanted to I could get off at stop 3 and arrange a ride or walk home but they let me keep my stop so if it was raining or no one was available i wasnt stuck at the top of a massive hill with no sidewalks trying to walk home on a 40mph road.  but man that bus ride was long.  i joke now that it prepped me for my current life of endless travel/driving.", "I was about the 15TH kid to get on every morning. It took about 45 mins to get to school and an hour home due to having to stop more because more kids rode the bus home. From what I heard from other kids this seemed to be the average time for all the bus routes except the few \u201cin town\u201d routes our district had.", "Ohio, I would have been first on last off if I didn't get off at the first stop and walk the rest \ud83e\udd37", "My kids were first on last off. We were the furthest stop.", "Are you serious? I was first on in the mornings and last off in the afternoons almost the entirety of my school life, what the hell are you on about?", "That\u2019s why I said the school doesn\u2019t have capacity\u2026 but I wouldn\u2019t expect every parent to understand school bus logistics. It was /fair/ for them to ask, and also reasonable for the answer to be no.", "This is how it worked in my district, the other way doesn\u2019t make logical sense to me. Where do they keep the school buses over night? If they\u2019re the easiest house to get to first thing in the morning why aren\u2019t they the easiest one to get to in the afternoon?", "Holy cow! Thank you. That answer makes so much more sense. I never realized it extended to the district and covered multiple schools. The only school I went to with busses had maybe 3 or 4, and they only picked up kids who lived a certain radius away from the school (45+ minutes away so parents who had to commute could still make it to work). \n\nThat really clears up so much! And definitely makes OP the AH. I think the simplest thing to do would be to hire a nanny with a car so she can grab them or do what my parents did and have me park my ass in the library until it was possible for them to grab me. If this whole kerfuffle is over them wanting more time to do homework, the library may make the most sense.", "But if they\u2019re the furthest away then HOW IS IT FASTER TO PICK THEM UP FIRST\n\nEdit I reread your comment and see your point now. Still seems so backwards to me and am thankful our district didn\u2019t treat us this way. Glad I was lucky enough to get into a good school district. This shit seems bonkers to me.", "Because the kids wait time is not the only consideration. The bus driver is also a person and this route could result in their day being extended several hours. They may have additional schools or routes for kids in sports and clubs. There are traffic considerations and that impacts cost of operation because it impacts fuel usage. Where does the bus go overnight ? Maybe the minor change for the kids is an hugely unreasonable headache for others. Not all transportation systems and routes are the same and just because that worked for you doesn't mean it can work everywhere", "Sorry, I forgot to reply to that! They get stressed over the amount of schoolwork that they have and want the extra time to complete it. They can't read/work on the bus due to motion sickness.", "It's a design choice - and I live in Alaska, so it's not like I'm saying this from a city or suburbia.", "Don\u2019t give OP any ideas", "Do you have ANY IDEA how much planning and coordination goes into bus routes?", "Especially if OP lives close to the bus depot, so having their pickup spot as the first up/last off is far more efficient for the TOTAL bus route.", "Our bus driver lived down the road from us and parked the bus at her house overnight. So we were some of the first kids on the bus and had to ride for nearly two hours. It was reversed on the way home so that she could drop off the last kid and be close to her house.", "Yes! My kids went to school in TN and spent an extra 90 minutes at school everyday because they were first on and last off. I never understood how this was fair. Talked the the school about it, only to be given no reason other than \"that's the way it is\" and that they would not change.", "Mine too. Hour and each way.", "Maybe I just went to a good school district? Not private school level or \u201cyou need to pass this test to get in\u201d level but as far as public schools go it was pretty good. I\u2019ll be honest there were plenty of things I didn\u2019t realize wasn\u2019t normal, like most school districts don\u2019t have a 5/6th grade building and that was bizarre to learn later in life. Maybe there were amenities my district had that I don\u2019t realize wasn\u2019t standard. Whoever was first to be picked up was absolutely the first to get off. This was true from preschool to 12 grade.", "Because in the afternoon the drivers start their route by picking up the kids at the school and END their route at the bus barn.", "You realise that the bus goes to the school in the morning and away from the school in the afternoon, right? The kids arent starting at home for both bus rides?", "The school bus isn\u2019t usually stored at the school. The start at the depot and pick kids up along the way to the school. In the afternoon, it\u2019s reversed.", "Ummm, because in the afternoon they start at the school? Then when all the drop offs are done the bus is right near the depot not on the other side of town.", "And it may not cover multiple schools. It could also be that the bus hub isn\u2019t at the school. So if the bus leaves the hub (point A) and is going to the school (point B) they may pass OP\u2019s house (house 1) first and the 7th kid\u2019s house (house 7) is closest to the school. So then on the way back, leaving the school (point B), they will pass house 7 first and house 1 last before returning to Point A at the bus hub. \n\nAnd it may be that they have coordinated the bus route to avoid dead ends or tight turn arounds or to drop kids off on the same side of the road because its safer than having them cross the road. There are a lot of logistics when planning bus routes.", "Some districts do loops, which you can do if it\u2019s a pretty small district where all the schools are relatively close to a bus barn and the other schools, or the driver\u2019s next stop is the same school (for extracurricular transportation or something). But this sounds like either a rural district or a suburban district with rural parts. OP described a Y shaped route that inevitably has some backtracking, but school districts are reluctant to backtrack unless there\u2019s no other choice for fuel and efficiency reasons. (It\u2019s not just about money it\u2019s about time because every minute of delay in getting to their next destination is a minute where the kids at the next school are out in the elements waiting for a bus.", "So screw everyone else then?", "How do you know none of the other children experience the same thing? I was in the exact same situation as your kids growing up and it was annoying but that\u2019s just life. Someone has to be the first and last, and it is not fair of you to get so upset that the school is not making your kids a priority. Very entitled!!!!", "So rather than using this as a great teachable moment on how to deal with things like stress and time management, you decided to go scream at the school workers.", "Im sure the other kids don\u2019t care at all about school is just your little special ones", "I had motion sickness too. Yet I was top of my class. They blame the bus for their issues?? Seems like you have more problems than just being absent parents.", "Dramamine exists", "Apparently it's so difficult that no one is able to make the mental leap to swap the am/pm arms at the very least so the kids don't spend two hours a day on the bus...doesn't sound very coordinated to me. I'm taking OP at their word but why keep two kids on for an extra 40 minutes when it adds only 6 minutes to the other route?", "Hey it was the same for us! We had a two hour ride with a bus change in the middle of it! I never meet other people with this experience.", "tennessee does not care about the children", "In my system the buses resided at the high school. Left high school in the morning, picked up high school and middle schoolers, drop them off, pick up 5/6, drop them off, pick up elementary, drop them off, go back to the high school.

It causes hyperactivity, dizziness, and dry mouth, overdose can cause a heart attack, and chronic use is associated with early cognitive decline. It\u2019s nasty stuff.", "We didn\u2019t have a bus change, but we had to drop the middle schoolers off before going to the high school everyday and the middle schoolers had to wait for the high schoolers to get out before they could be taken home. Also, anytime a driver was out, our bus took on more students until it was way over capacity. They justified it by saying the extra students were just across the highway and wouldn\u2019t be on the bus long.", "This is true. After my second grader kept coming home and talking about how she was in charge of the class while her teacher was out in the hallway chatting. And the fact that the ENTIRE class was placed in Title reading, was sent to a different classroom only for the teacher to disappear for the entire hour and come back in to take them back to their regular classroom. \n\nParking and signing them out for appointments was an absolute nightmare and it was utter chaos if you wanted to pick them up after school. After one year in TN schools, I took them out and homeschooled the rest of the time we were there.", "they do make non drowsy dramamine, but it does take a bit to kick in and doesn\u2019t work for everyone. i\u2019ve taken it to help with minor motion sickness or simulator sickness, but i\u2019m also smart enough to know i shouldn\u2019t read in moving vehicles", "Oh boy that sounds like very rural bus situation", "i feel for you and your kids. i know the pain of tennessee schools. i went to the university of tennessee knoxville and the big orange screw was so real. so so very real", "Oh yeah. I think we had a total of like 12 buses for two schools or something like that. The middle and high schools were the only one around for miles too, so everyone went there."]}
