Last month, her mom had a stroke unexpectedly and she became responsible for taking care of her after she was released from the hospital. When she told me, I said I was sorry, sent my love, and offered to be of help. At the time, I was staying with friends for the week out of town. We spoke once over the phone, and texted a bit, but didn\u2019t talk much. I thought that was fine, assuming she wanted space since I had asked her whether there was anything I could do, and she didn\u2019t respond.\n\nA few days later, while still away, I texted her to apologize for not being there to support her more and asked if she was upset. She said she was hurt. I told her I already apologized but reminded her that I had texted her to check in but didn\u2019t know what kind of support she wanted and how much of it to give since she didn\u2019t tell me, and in any event I was away with friends and wanted to be present with them. She got really upset, and said that my comment made it seem like I prioritized my friends over her. I said that was not true and not fair\u2014 I was in touch but just didn\u2019t give as much as she wanted. I said I understood she was hurt, but that i wasn't at fault and wasn\u2019t an appropriate target for her anger. She then told me it's important that she can trust me to support her in an emergency. I said that if she didn't trust me, then that was a huge issue and I told her i didn't want tot talk about this if she was going to be angry with me. I ended the conversation after that because it felt like it was getting out of hand. I know she\u2019s in pain but she\u2019s not entitled to blow up at me for it so it seemed important to stand my ground, but things have not gotten better.\n\nAITA for staying on vacation after her mom\u2019s stroke?", "created_utc": 1691028455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gr3e3/aita_for_staying_on_vacation_during_girlfriends/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just showed her either that you don't know what love is/requires or that you don't actually love her. Stop wasting her time. Does anyone feel a sense of responsibility for anyone else anymore? Some of these AITAs are mind-blowing.", "YTA. You asked her if she was upset and then got mad that she was. You reminded her you \u201calready apologized\u201d and therefore she should have immediately stopped having feelings. You then quit the conversation YOU started because she was upset.", "I\u2019m very glad for your former girlfriend that she found out so early in your relationship that you will not be there for her in a crisis. It would be heartbreaking if she had actually married you and then discovered that you are so shallow and self absorbed that you would stay on vacation, occasionally sending her an anemic text, as her life collapsed around her. But, hey, it\u2019s great how you were able to \u201cbe present\u201c with your friends.\n\nYTA", "YTA. This is the time for you to \u201cstand your ground\u201d, to show how you are so proud for having done nothing for her? You do realize the level of support you\u2019ve shown her is barely passable for a close friend, let alone a partner of 1 year?", "YTA. You wanted her to specify her needs. Her mum just had a stroke. She became a care provider. She\u2019s not necessarily going to be able to say specific needs because the situation is new and emotional and exhausting. She may spend most time dealing with immediate stuff, she can\u2019t deal with the load you are pushing on her. Read the situation. Maybe she wants someone to turn up and offer support/ look to do what you can. Even if it is only making tea and being there. uBut I also see the push on how she didn\u2019t ask. Asking for support doesn\u2019t always happen. Not least because, often for women in particular, it leads to the demand of more work, aka tell me what to do, how and when, manage me while I do it and praise me after and so on, which - perhaps unwittingly-can  feel like having to step back, assess, set up a project, brief a cranky employee and manage them at a time when you are overwhelmed. All with the suspicion that the eventual help received might just not be worth the energy spent getting it. And the real risk of a critique that along with everything else she is now also to blame for poor management and communication skills and needs to apologize. This whole thing is a common issue in relationships. Almost, judgement almost doesn\u2019t matter. She didn\u2019t ask and specify. You win. She\u2019s alone with this but you are boyfriend of the year. The emotional dissonance frustrates everyone.", "If she said she would really like you to be there to support her, would you have left your trip with friends?", "YTA. These kinds of emergencies are incredibly emotionally and mentally exhausting, and you are making it worse by insisting that she carry the mental burden of writing you a list or giving you a road map to \"supportive boyfriend\". You shouldn't need her to tell you how to be supportive.", "It's clear that you care more about your friends than your girlfriend. \n\nYTA", "I knew you were an asshole when you said, \u201c A few days later, while still away, I text her to apologize for not being there to support her more.\u201d\n\nDUDE, not only did you basically blank on her for days, but you didn't even have the decency to call her and apologize; you actually sent a freaking text. The fact that you apologized means you knew you weren't being supportive when YOU KNEW she needed you. I understand friends being essential and being present with them, BUT certain things take precedence, and you're girlfriend\u2019s (of ONE YEAR) mother having a stroke and your girl having to take care of her definitely counts as one of those precedence things I mentioned earlier.

Even so, she probably needs round the clock care that could completely alter your girlfriend\u2019s life and you didn\u2019t know what level of support she needed?! Yeah, she shouldn\u2019t have had to say. It\u2019s pretty obvious. If something like that happened to my partner I\u2019d want to be with them immediately. To help them and comfort them.

Imagine a close member of your family having a life threatening medical emergency. Can you do that? Can you picture that in your mind?

Now, do you imagine that you would actually have to ask her to please bring her pathetic ass home instead of staying on holidays, and being \u201cpresent\u201d for her mates? Do you think you\u2019d have to do that? Or do you think what would actually happen is she\u2019d be on the next flight home and be at the hospital before your mom even got released? Huh??

There are people who, when a crisis strikes, ask if their help is needed, and wait for an answer. Then there are people who swing into action, sharing the burden and lightening the load without being asked. I am the second type, and I'm beyond grateful that my husband is too. For me, the last thing I'd want when responding to a crisis is the additional burden of my SO needing me to take the time to figure out how he can help, and communicate that. It's obvious from the comments though, that there are people who would prefer that, I think it just depends on your personal style.", "YTA, always ask your partner about stuff, especially if your partner is a girl, they want us to read minds sometimes bro and we can\u2019t so you just gotta ask and whatever their response is, take it with upmost seriousness even if they did say \u201cI wanna be left alone for a bit\u201d and didn\u2019t because they\u2019re grown and could\u2019ve said they wanted your comfort but you didn\u2019t even bother to ask her if she needed you.

I understand you shouldn\u2019t argue with her after this traumatic event, but at the same time it would be crazy to expect you to fly home from vacation?  That costs money and the trip is only for a week.  You did as much as you could possibly do short of flying home and she should be happy with that.\n\nBefore everyone comes at me, I do acknowledge you were a bit of an AH in your response to her being upset.  It\u2019s okay to know in your head that you\u2019re right about something without saying it.  And probably omit the part about focusing on your friends.  It is totally reasonable to enjoy your vacation the way it is supposed to be enjoyed, but you don\u2019t have to tell her that.", "NAH\n\nYou asked if there's anything you can do, she didn't respond. You're not psychic.\n\nShe wants support in an emergency, she needs to be able to communicate that.\n\nThat being said, I'm going with NAH because she's dealing with a lot and may not really know how to communicate her needs, which makes some of this understandable. She's not an asshole for not knowing how to communicate in crisis,but it's something for her to be aware of and work on.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t a mind reader. How hard is it to say, \u201cPlease come home, I need you.\u201d? This isn\u2019t like weaponized incompetence where you act like you don\u2019t know how to scrub a dish so you don\u2019t have to. In a family medical emergency situation I quite honestly would want my partner to tell me what would be helpful for them. It\u2019s called communication. I\u2019d have thought her mom would still be hospitalized after having a stroke and there wasn\u2019t anything much to be done by you except emotional support. It sounds like you were checking in to see how she was and trusted her to tell you if she wanted you to come home. \n\nAfter things have cooled off it may be worth having a conversation about what you both find helpful in high stress situations. Some people might need space and time to process. Clearly your girlfriend would rather have your physical presence but may struggle in asking for what she needs when she\u2019s overwhelmed.", "So OP there's apparently some major missing information here that apparently the gf didn't share that bears pointing out or maybe I missed it after reading through it twice you didn't mention.  1.  Mother had a stroke - what exactly does that mean health-wise because there are several issues that could have happened from something very minor where she was released from the ER to still being hospitalized.  2.  GF specifically said that I want you to physically next to me and comfort me and I'm not expecting you to be able to read my mind.  3.  She specifically expressed to me that in the event of a crisis, when we started dating, it was part of our unwritten agreement that I fawn over her every waking moment.  It may seem overly dramatic, but I get so tired of people in relationships expecting the other person to know and do everything for their partner on cue from watching too many romcoms.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You really convinced yourself you\u2019re the good guy in all of this. Lol", "Even if it was impossible to travel home could you not ask a friend to help her or buy food and send it to her so she didn\u2019t have to cook because sometimes people in crisis forget to take care of themselves.

My dad ended up in hospital quite suddenly and died just over a week later. You know what support I wanted? I didn't know. So my hubby just did things that would make my life easier. On top of his normal things he would do extra. He would sort out dinner. Do some washing. He would put my favourite music on. He would give me a big cuddle. Etc.

Most times they don\u2019t actually want to do anything\u2026 I know, because when I would ask for help, if you can immediately see the regretted offering. Don\u2019t ask if someone needs some thing if you have no intention of helping them.\n\nDon\u2019t add to her burden. If you can only help in very specific ways, throw out those suggestions say are you hungry I can DoorDash you some food. Do you need gas money? Offer to buy her mom flowers\u2026 my point is even if you can\u2019t physically be in a space, you can still do things to make your partners life easier as they care for their parent but you will only make your life easier if you take the initiative. Don\u2019t make it her responsibility to figure out how you can remotely support her. She doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth to deal with that BS. \n\nLastly, it is important to recognize that it is not appropriate for you to dictate someone else's feelings. The way you handled the confrontation with your girlfriend appears to be manipulative. Despite knowing that she was upset with you and the reasons behind it, you deliberately chose to confront her on the matter. In response, she expressed her anger honestly and emotionally, but you punished her for doing so.\n\nIn my opinion, this behavior raises a significant red flag. It seems that if someone feels let down by you, you expect them to not display emotion and instead expect them to be more concerned with your ego. This implies that you are unwilling to have a conversation on an equal footing, acknowledge her perspective, or even hold yourself accountable for your actions. You only want her to agree that she was wrong. This kind of dynamic prevents open and healthy communication.\n\nI believe it's unfair to label you as a jerk simply because you didn't immediately leave everything and return to your girlfriend. It doesn't make you a horrible boyfriend either if you didn't explore all possible ways to support her while still being on vacation. However, it is concerning that you deliberately instigated a fight. Your girlfriend responded honestly, and instead of understanding her perspective, you chose to punish her by once again leaving and not supporting her, particularly for expressing her anger.\n\nPerhaps if you had been willing to stay and endure her anger, she might have eventually come to an agreement with you. However, it's possible that she needed to have a conversation with you to express her thoughts and feelings.", "INFO: You didn\u2019t want to be there to support your girlfriend during such a difficult time? \n\nDid you want to spend time with your friends more than you wanted to support your GF?", "YTA", "NTA, you state you have dated for a year per your post.  It's sad and tragic your GF's mom had a stroke, but you are dating, you aren't living together, you aren't engaged.

Your GF should have been upfront and asked if you could come back and support her emotionally her inability to communicate her needs speaks volumes that you will always have to play 20 questions before you get the correct answer from her.\n\nYour GF is the EHS because she didn't ask you to cancel your trip after her mom had the stroke, her inability to communicate and articulate her needs during a crisis is incorrect.

Finally someone that answered the question with logic opposed to emotion", "Her mom had a stroke!!!! He clearly cares nothing for her or her family. Her not answering is not saying she didn\u2019t need him to come home. He should have asked again. Why is it that she is supposed to give him directions on not being an asshole partner when she was already mentally overloaded. He might not be a mind reader but he sent her a very clear message of where his priorities lie. He will probably have plenty of time on his hands to fully devote attention to his friends when he is single.OP, yes you are a total asshole!!! YTA", "Also, asking in 3 separate places with the same results? Desperate for a different answer?", "Given his user name, it sounds like he uses his gun to work out his issues. \n\nAnd BTW, OP YTA and a useless partner.", "How much you want to bet it\u2019s just OP using a different account to justify himself", "If you can not figure that out on your own but need your obviously traumatized and overwhelmed girlfriend to actually articulate it then you lack the empathy to be in a grown up relationship.", "When you go through a traumatic experience you often don\u2019t know how to ask for help. This guy lacks even the most minuscule degree of empathy.", "Found OP\u2019s real account", "It's not rocket science for him to ask \"Would you like me to come there and help?\" When you're in the middle of a crisis, you're often not thinking clearly for a lot of reasons including sleep deprivation. If a friend of mine went through this, I would be asking about various things I could do to help because they probably are saving all of their coherent thoughts *for their parent who they are trying to help with a health crisis.* I literally just went through this with a friend and asked about various ways I could support her.", "He wanted to be present for his friends. No way would he have left them.", "Dude, seriously. Stop. You keep saying she should have communicated better while being under stress and fear, sleep deprived...and OP was relaxing with friends. He didnt even call her everyday, he just texted a bit. No excuses here. Also, if after a year you cant prioritize your partner and you absolutely need to hear them say they need you while a crisis or you just assume  everything is fine, you don't know what it means to be a partner.\n\nHe didnt even offer options. He didn't even try.", "Are you OP? One of his friends? Lmao shut up", "Man, I'm with you. No partner, no matter how well they know you, will be able to read your mind. EXPECTING that is ridiculous. If that were the goalpost, literally everyone would fail. \n\nUnless you have expressed yourself in clear, simple words, you cannot be angry that a partner did not do what you wanted. \n\nMaybe it's just because I was raised by an autistic woman, but I value clear communication. And I can't hold anyone responsible for something I haven't clearly communicated.", "Judging from your repeated comments, there are two types of texts you need to learn:\n\n1. Context\n2. Subtext\n\nThe people in your life will thank you for it.", "Judging from his lack of thought/ consideration for her, there\u2019s not much of a mind for him to use.", "Yes, he was supposed to offer to get on a plane/train/bus or drive. He should have offered whatever he was willing to do, not made the person in the crisis guess what he was willing to do and beg for it. And what he should have been willing to do, if he loves her, is come home.", "You\u2019ve replied to almost every single comment bro please  get a hobby", "I got downloaded to s*** for saying this.  Nice to see someone else read the same thing I did", "If gf\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t know OP well, she may not want them around when she is vulnerable like that.\n\nSince OP wouldn\u2019t know what their gf\u2019s mom wants, it is gf\u2019s responsibility to communicate that to OP. OP didn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t have, made that assumption alone. So they asked. They didn\u2019t want to be aggressive/clingy. They checked in. They aren\u2019t a mind reader.", "I\u2019m thinking the ex girlfriend dodged a bullet with this one.", "I had the same thought!"]}
