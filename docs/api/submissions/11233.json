We had a trip planned for the summer together with some other close friends.\n\nI was responsible for organising the trip, so a day after I got the terrible news, I went ahead and cancelled everything we booked. We never officially 'discussed' it before the cancellation, but it was said between the lines that no-one wants to go without her.\n\nSince they already paid for the airbnb, I gave them their money back once everything was taken care of. And that's when they found out what I've been busy with. They got furious, called me cold-hearted for starting on these chores so early. \n\nFor me, mourning and moving on are two separate things that don't collide. I can mourn her without messing things up for others, especially since it's an expensive trip that none of us can afford if we're not going. I was heartbroken when I had to cancel each and everything we once had planned together, but I just don't think it's right to put my feelings first when it's my responsibility to make sure things don't get even harder for everyone else. And I don't see how I've hurt anyone.\n\nBut for the others, what I did was like erasing my best friend from my life right after they died. Her husband is now refusing to let me go to her funeral because I 'obviously don't care'. \n\nWas what I did really so harmful?", "created_utc": 1677681162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f59cq/aita_for_moving_on_right_after_my_best_friend/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can\u2019t ignore them. At the same time dealing with then can distract you from everything else.", "You are not an asshole, but you might be German. NTA\n\nIt probably feels odd to your friends, but I can totally understand why you did what you did. Some of us put everything off when they are mourning, like the father yesterday who waited four months to tell his son that his half sister died before being born, and was angry his mother explained first. \n\nOthers have to make sure everything is organised down to the last triangle prawn sandwich at the funeral before collapsing in grief.\n\nThis is just a mismatch by the sound of it.", "NTA.  You don't show how much you cared for someone by losing a lot of money because plans have changed.   You were most certainly not moving on. You were dealing with the aftermath of a tragedy.  \n\n[This is no different and no worse than informing social security that an elderly recipient has passed away; which I did the day after my own parent passed. One has to deal with this stuff quickly and efficiently in order to mourn properly.]\n\nMy condolences on your loss. For what it's worth, I  think that you did the right thing in mitigating the financial losses that would have made everything that much worse.", "NTA. It's like organising the funeral - somebody's got to!", "NTA - I absolutely understand being practical about things in situations like this.\nOften some people process by taking care of things, others are immobilised. Neither is right or wrong, the grief comes when it comes.\nI'm so sorry for the loss of your friend.", "Definitely NTA. Actually, i'd be very impressed with your ability to function while mourning and more than \"happy\" (as one could be under the circumstances) that you managed to save us all a lot of money and upsets. It's weird, yes, but not even remotely proof that you \"don't care\". Maybe next time you could've waited till after the funeral to give them their money back, since no-one wants to talk money in those circumstances.", "NTA\n\nWe can all be reactionary when we\u2019re in mourning, and often look for something to blame.\n\nI am sorry you have to \u201cprove\u201d to the family and friends that you care (if you wanted to), in order to be included.\n\nYou should be able to mourn in your own time, and I hope you are able.", "NTA \n\nPeople react differently to grief. It seems you compartmentalised and went into activity mode. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nSorry for your loss", "Nta - we all grieve differently, and that includes both displacement activity (you) and blowing things out of proportion (her friends). I think apologising for not consulting them first is reasonable - you can honestly say that you weren't thinking straight. I'm sorry about your friend.", "NTA\n\nWe all mourn in different ways.  Honestly, you were being mature and responsible to ensure other people aren't financially hurt by the unexpected loss.\n\nWhen a family member dies, there's always **someone** who has to do all of the essential chores even while they're mourning as well.  That person is absolutely **NOT THE AH**.   They're the quiet, strong one holding space so everyone else can collapse.\n\nOften, such people put their feelings \"on hold\" to do what must be done, then perhaps they break down.   I'd say their excluding you from her funeral makes them total AH's here.", "I N F O: So you never even discussed to cancel the trip or not with the others? Have you thought about whether your friends still wanted to go to honor their friend's memory?\n\nAlso, sorry for your loss.\n\nEDIT: NTA.", "NTA at all. But don\u2019t get into an argument with anyone about it right now. People will be in all sorts of different places in their grief, especially her husband.", "you went to autopilot and i suspect you will have a breakdown later along the line. this is also how i cope, tell your friends to stop making it about them.", "NTA ... Your actions make sense, and have no bearing on your grief.\n\nBut pro tip ... Wait until after the funeral before you do anything of any substance.  I only say this because the purpose of a funeral is that it is the crossroad where you say goodbye.  It's the ceremony in which we grieve and then move forward.  Until that ceremony, many people think life is at a standstill.  They need that moment of \"goodbye\" to take a next step.\n\nWe all grieve differently.  I have a friend who cannot bring himself to attend a funeral. Nope. Not going to do it.  He has learned to move forward without the ritual.\n\nMe? I like the symbolism of the ceremony.  It is like stepping through a door, for me.\n\nPeople are very funny about how they react.  They believe that no one could feel as much pain as they do, but, paradoxically, are angry if you don't feel this great pain in respect of who they love.  Grief is irrational.  But it is what it is, and will be what we each need to process ourselves.\n\nAnyway ..  rule of thumb, if you can do it, is not until after the funeral.  And even longer in some cases because different people have different opinions.\n\nI am sorry for your loss", "Their reasoning makes no sense to me...I honestly would have asked you if you were feeling okay having to deal with that immediately after learning about such a tragedy. You have my respect for being able to handle such a task.\nNTA.", "I don't understand the issue here, it sounds like you took care of everything so no one else had to take on the burden of doing it. \n\nI would assumed you were trying to distract yourself from your emotions by doing logical tasks. I think NTA but I also don't understand their POV at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some process it by breaking down and getting all the hurt and loss out in one epic cry.  Some throw themselves into work, or taking care of tying up matters of the estate.  It sounds like you're maybe in the latter group.  For some, this can also be a way of maintaining control...the individual is gone, no one can change that, and it's a terrible feeling.  But tying up these loose ends, things that NEED doing, is something that you can absolutely control, and having things to keep them busy is comforting to some. Just be sure to give yourself time to properly grieve later on, in whatever way you feel most comfortable.", "NTA. I'm the same way. When something terrible happens that is out of my control, I throw myself into dealing with things I can control so I can feel like I'm helping.", "NTA I might have done the same thinking that it would hurt to have to do it later, so better to rush through whatever I knew had to be done so I could just focus on what I feel.", "NTA \n\nTheir reaction is more than likely their grief talking.  What you are doing/able to do sounds like being able to compartmentalize things in life; it's not necessarily a bad thing.  Most people can't do this or even understand how anyone else can, especially when it comes to emotions.   Just keep the lines of communication open so that maybe once their grief isn't all consuming,  you can work on your friendship,", "NTA sending love your way.", "I will weep in your place.", "NTA.  One of my closest friends died last summer and I went straight into being the person that informed everyone, and who was heavily involved in conveying updates and helping organise the funeral.

It was great that you took the initiative and everyone\u2019s around to grieve their own way. I\u2019d be grateful if I was in this friend group.", "NTA. Nobody gets to dictate how and whether you grieve.", "NTA\n\nThey are reacting out of grief right now. If you hadn't done this, in a month they would have been angry at how much money they lost because you hadn't acted sooner. They're shocked that you're able to compartmentalize and do something practical during such a tumultuous time. That's all. It doesn't mean you're not feeling the full force of the same grief they are. \n\nI hope you are able to talk to them/they come around before the funeral. Best of luck.", "NTA\n\nLife does still happen as we grieve. This was obviously time sensitive, cancel or have to pay, and doesn\u2019t differ much from\u2026.\n\nHaving to organize and write for obituary, notifications and organization of funeral, logistics of out of town family coming, organizing mercy dinner, settling financial affairs, notifying employers/lenders/utilities, and on and on\u2026..\n\nThe passing of family and friends is sad. We grieve. We also sweep up a lot of real life responsibilities. Don\u2019t see how this trip was any different.", "NTA.  The rest of the world doesn\u2019t stop when anyone dies. People still have to do petty drudgery like pay bills, do laundry, clean toilets. SOMEBODY had to cancel the trip and as the trip organizer that was *you*!

Because I didn\u2019t understand why they would overreact to a very considerate gesture.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal for someone to take control of the essentials during a tragedy like this. It\u2019s even deeply appreciated by most people since it leaves others to focus on grieving while not fearing that important matters will spiral out of control. \n\nMaybe deep down they were hoping someone would forget and it would be too late to cancel? Then they\u2019d be left with no choice but to go on the vacation anyway? Then they\u2019d say something like \u2018we will go in our friend\u2019s honour, she would have wanted that?\u2019 This is all conjecture but I do wonder.\n\nNTA. I\u2019m sorry OP.", "I never asked them explicitly like \"so we're not going?\", but when we were talking about her, someone said our tradition of going on trips together no longer makes any sense because she was the centre of our friends circle.
