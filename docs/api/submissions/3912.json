Who would do this? Sounds like a scam...", "Battery dies after an hour? Had it been showing any weakness before? Did person leave it parked with lights on? It just seems really fishy. The first thing I encountered problems with a borrowed car is to call the owner and see what they'd like done. Taking it to get looked at and replacing the battery? Is it actually a new battery in there? I fear it is an old battery or one refurbished to look new. You get charges from mechanic , they use your battery taken out elsewhere.\n\nI'd ask for original battery back , the replacement battery returned. The borrower , depending on your relationship should pickup the cost of service unless it is super important and you eat the cost. Consider never lending vehicle to this person again", "NTA.\nYou weren't aware something has happened. Also, given it's a new vehicle, it's only natural to want to know so you can investigate it further and get it checked out to make sure it won't be an ongoing issue not to mention, out of pocket expenses which could have been done under warranty.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds fishy. \n\nCheck if a repair done by third party does not neutralize the warranty. And honestly I would take it to the authorized auto shop to scheck if it has even been replaced and everything works as it should.", "You are NTA. And you aren\u2019t paying for the battery. Let moms boyfriend figure it out, since he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to ask you or at least for the price beforehand", "NTA. He should have called when he knew there was a problem. I wouldn\u2019t trust this person if I were you. Definitely don\u2019t loan your truck to them anymore.", "Nta \n\nCall the \"mechanic\" and tell them you aren't paying for any work they do to it. Call the dealership Monday and have them tow it to them. The \"mechanic\" might try to keep it for non-payment. If they do, call the police and tell them that you did not authorize them to do any work to your car and that you lent it to someone who brought it there without your permission. The \"mechanic\" can take it up with your mom's boyfriend.\n\nThreaten to press charges for theft against the \"mechanic\" or the boyfriend. A felony usually resolves these situations quickly and will teach the offender to. Keep his fingers out of your wallet.", "I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re under no legal obligation to pay, and it sounds scammy.  How could it be too late to get your old battery back?  NTA", "NTA. Don't pay that bill. I'm sure it only needed a jump start at best.", "NTA. This person who borrowed the car made a decision to put a new battery into your NEW car without consulting you. You owe them nothing, and should not be paying them for their mistake. \n\nAnd who doesn't understand that a car less than 2 years old is usually still on warranty (or at least pause to ask about it)?", "In the US at least, you must sign paperwork to be on the hook for auto repairs.  Do you have similar laws? If your mom's boyfriend signed the papers he's the one liable for payment. If he didn't, well, that's even shadier.\n\nThis whole thing is very suspicious.\n\nNTA", "NTA I would just let him know you appreciate it but he needs to get the old battery switched back because the truck is under warranty. If something actually goes wrong with the battery he put in its possibly they'll consider the warranty void as they won't replace a random battery from some sketchy neighbor of your moms weird bf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they don't help, you find the general manager next. You're not liable for unauthorized repairs, and the shop would have to take this as a loss.\n\nIf the mechanic supposedly did this work from his home, that's bs. Mom's boyfriend just happens to know a neighbor that's a mechanic?

The battery is still young.\n\nHe damaged it by discharging it fully, probably left all the electronics run without the engine.\nUsually the car shuts down if the battery is nearly empty, so a Jumpstart should've been enough.
