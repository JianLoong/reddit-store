Is it actually a new battery in there? I fear it is an old battery or one refurbished to look new. You get charges from mechanic , they use your battery taken out elsewhere.\n\nI'd ask for original battery back , the replacement battery returned.

Just because a vehicle needs jump-starting doesn't mean its battery needs replacing.\n\nHeck, I had a massive issue with my car battery constantly being flat earlier this year.
