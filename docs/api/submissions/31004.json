Her options are:\n\n1. Ask in advance what was being served and offered to bring something she likes to share with everyone. \n\n2. Explained her pickiness (again in advance) and asked if she could bring her own food. \n\n3. Eaten before the event. \n\n4. Declined to attend if any of the above would not have worked. \n\nSince she was already there she should have politely declined the host's offer and hung out with the group as I assume the purpose of this event was for everyone to enjoy each other's company.", "NTA, but the aspect that is bothering me the most is that your host spent all day cooking so that she could miss the meal making a grilled cheese sandwich for a plus one that couldn\u2019t even be bothered to TRY the food. Your girlfriend isn\u2019t an asshole because she is a picky eater, it\u2019s the lack of appreciation/respect for her host and the effort they had gone to in order to SHARE a special meal with their friends. That\u2019s why I think everyone is so frustrated by adult picky eaters that aren\u2019t suffering from a medical issue. It takes a special kind of entitlement and lack of self awareness to think you deserve to be catered to because you have a ridiculously limited list of foods you\u2019re willing to eat. I would have also been embarrassed, it\u2019s not about being a picky eater, it\u2019s the lack of consideration for your host who was being incredibly gracious.", "I'll say NTA because it would be extremely embarrassing that this happens repeatedly when she knows she's \"picky\" and makes no preparations for it.\n\nI would honestly be embarrassed as hell for people to have to deal with my GF having the eating habits of a fussy child.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t take her with you anymore if food is involved. Children who don\u2019t know how to act appropriately in social settings get to stay home with babysitters.", "INFO : is your girlfriend over the age of 8 ?", "NTA. If her diet is that limited for whatever reason (ARFID or overgrown toddler), she should have been prepared and brought her own food or eaten in advance.

Yes: embarrassing and YES: incredibly rude.", "In this specific instance, I think you were the asshole. \n\nShe was behaving just fine, she doesn't have to eat food she she doesn't like at a dinner party, she wasn't complaining about it, and said she was ok. The hostess made the offer to make something else, not your girlfriend. And maybe she should have insisted a little harder that that wasn't necessary, but I am doubting the hostess would have been comfortable with that. \n\nYOU are the one who grabbed her and insisted she leave the entire party, like she was a misbehaving dog being put outside. (You realize your friend's girlfriend likely thinks you're abusive, now, right?)\n\nAs an aside: There is, actually, an etiquette rule that you never comment on the food present during a dinner party, specifically for situations like this. Someone not eating generally doesn't want attention called to it. It can also get awkward if someone doesn't want to share recipes, negs their food for compliments, or burnt or ruined something. But, most people don't know etiquette, so they aren't aware of this, so situations like this happen.", "YTA. GF said she was a picky eater, host offered to make her something else \u2014 so what was the problem?

Yikes. You're being horribly rude to both the host and your GF.", "YTA \n\n\nYour girlfriend didn't ask for different food, the host offered when she noticed she wasn't eating. If the host was your friend, it was your job to explain dietary restrictions at the beginning, your girlfriend seemed content to just sit there. You know what she does/doesn't eat, what did you expect her to do?", "YTA she sounds like she has AFRID and should probably look into some treatment. And the host literally offered, she didn't ask for something they weren't willing to do. Also in a restaurant??? It's bad for her to ask for what she wants to eat when it's literally a paid service?? I often ask for stuff like \"can I have the X dish but replace the side with other-side-in-menu\" and I never had a single restaurant say no, sometimes there's an extra charge but I'm willing to pay more to have something I actually like", "YTA for your attitude towards your gfs pickiness \n\nPeople are picky for different reasons, whether it's due to medical issues like autism, ARFID, other texture/sensory issues\n\nA failure on their parents part to try to introduce them to new foods as a child, and so their pickiness was enabled\n\nOr maybe they are simply picky\n\nThe reason doesn't matter, but your attitude towards your girlfriend makes you an asshole \n\nIf you are going to continually be embarrassed by her pickiness, when you know it's an issue for you, and she isn't bothered by it, just break up with her\n\nYou can find someone who shares your tastes in food, and she can find someone more patient in handling her pickiness instead of making her feel like shit", "NTA Being picky is childish and immature. \"Ewww veggies,\" but all grown up now. That list of the only things she'll eat are all the kind of things kids would eat exclusively if they were allowed. On top of that, she's going to get fat because all those foods are unhealthy AF. In addition, who TF honestly decides, \"Yeah this steak and mashed potatoes looks great but I'd rather eat some chimkin nuggies.\" I can't stand kidults.", "why don't you let the host do a nice thing?\n\nalso, you ate lying in the title. your gf didn't ask if there is a different. food, she answer a question honestly. YTA", "Is she 12? That\u2019s a stupidly childish diet. My son had a better repertoire at 8 and he was an incredibly picky eater. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re GF is a picky eater, she\u2019s a diabetic waiting to happen.", "NTA.  How long are you going to stay with her?", "this is a good way to have fat kids in the future if she can't eat like a regular adult, what is she going to give young kids?? nta.", "YTA it's not your place to think about or police what she should or should not eat. You obviously have no idea why she has her preference, so why do you think you know better than her? How does what she eats, or doesn't affect you? Here's a big hint: it doesn't. Your job, if you have one, would be to make sure there's going to be something for her to eat when you take her somewhere. A very large part of that would be for you to understand exactly what it is that she requires. Why isn't really important, but if it's a texture thing, or whatever, you need to be able to accurately assess the suitability of the options.\n\nThere's no reason that it would be embarrassing, unless one was unreasonably insecure, so you phone ahead and have a conversation with someone (probably the person hosting or cooking) about the options available, and their ability to accommodate your gf's needs, and you deal with it as if it is no big deal, because it isn't.", "NTA, my boyfriend was relatively picky, then again he was raised with \"I put pepperoncini juice in it, its a bit spicy\" I started cooking and he's happy and enjoys it. Sometimes it takes trying new things, not saying she is or isn't but if you don't try new things you dont learn what tastes good. But with any sensory issues her pickiness is validated but she as an adult is responsible for preparing for that.", "What kind of an asshole shows up to a dinner party, sits at the table, and has the host serve them a plate of food *knowing full well* they no intention of so much as trying a bite?\n\nThis isn't about being a picky eater. It's about being incredibly rude. I wouldn't be with someone like that.", "NTA picky eaters are embarrassing and rude.", "She\u2019s a grown woman and needs to learn to accommodate herself.\n\nOptions:\n\n1) She eats before she arrives just in case.\n2) Packs something for her to eat just in case.\n3) Contacts the host beforehand and asks what the food will be, if it\u2019s something she won\u2019t eat then she eats her own food before or after the event and doesn\u2019t eat during the event.\n\nI would be embarrassed too. It *is* rude to inconvenience the host by asking them to make you a whole other meal because you\u2019re picky.\n\nUnless it\u2019s an actual thing behind the pickiness (ARFID, autism, etc.), then she could contact the host beforehand and warn of her dietary restrictions, assuming they\u2019re not ridiculous, and ask if anything will fit her needs, or if there could be some sort of something she could eat as well, even if it\u2019s just some fruit platter on the table as well as the rest of the food.", "Wait\u2026 are you dating my sister in law?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
