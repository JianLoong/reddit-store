Some things, one person is just plain wrong and needs to sit down and shut up. \n\nA lot of people (read: controlling assholes) like to throw around the \"compromise\" flag because it sounds reasonable and mature.

This won't be the only one. \n\nHe's probably trying to stress you out to the point where you just find it easier to agree than to disagree. Then, if you start compromising over stupid but rather \"unimportant\" stuff to cater him, it'll be way easier to make you compromise on other stuff as well. At some point, you'll start doing whatever he wants, because you did everything else already and it's easier than to argue. \nAbusers usually start showing their true colours once they feel safe. I guess you and him celebrating Christmas together instead of visiting your family made him comfortable enough to start his show. NTA. PLEASE RUN.", "NTA. Never come between a woman and her fuzzy robe", "lol I wear my robe even in front of guests. idc. he sounds like he can be super controlling. NTA OP", "He\u2019s obviously unaware of the jackets that are worn inside in the winter i\u2019m Japan, I see them in manga and anime and they look comfy. I always have a robe on or a fluffy sweater or nightshirt in winter I like to be warm. He\u2019s strange.. NTA", "What an AH - HE is. Can\u2019t believe he asked you to change how you look, what you wear, etc - to assuage him. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the robe - it\u2019s an early sign of coercion and abusive behavior. If you haven\u2019t been with someone abusive - you would be normal to not see this as more than an offensive attitude. But I promise you - there\u2019s something more sinister at play here. And he may not know it - but most adults know they don\u2019t get the say-so on how others look, act, speak, etc.", "NTA. I would seriously be reconsidering this relationship before he drips more marinara flags on your perfectly cozy robe.", "I wore my flannel pj pants and a hoodie to the grocery store on xmas eve, with my husband. That was a first for me. He said he didn't care. \n\nMy husband will come in, shuck his clothes for pj's and a robe, at 2pm. He gets it!", "Right?!\n\nThis really got me:\n\n> he said I was an AH for not willing to compromise\n\n*Compromise*\u2026. about\u2026 what? Is OP going to wear half a robe? Maybe a terrycloth pantsuit? A pair of starched and ironed pyjamas he deems are \u201cproductive\u201d looking enough for a day lounging at home?!\n\nNo, he doesn\u2019t want compromise. He wants evidence that OP will give in to his wants and whims without asking questions or voicing opinions. This is very \u201ca housewife must have a dress and makeup on all day in case someone comes to call and so her husband will literally never ever see her with her makeup off.\u201d\n\nCompromises happen when both parties have valid needs and concerns. Not when one of them just wants the other to dress like they\u2019re pretending to go to a work / social event.\n\nThis is three months in.. OP, I would not get too attached to this guy until you\u2019ve visited his home, or spent more time at his place.  I\u2019d be wanting to figure out where this attitude of his is coming from. In my experience, this type of guy has very often got a misogynist father with strong opinions about how his mother should behave, and a mother who is either meek and accommodating or has internalized misogyny of her own. That, or he was raised by narcissists who reinforced to him that his opinions and preferences should always be given due deference, and that anyone resisting accommodating them is doing something wrong. OR sometimes they\u2019re just rich, and genuinely believe \u201cpoor\u201d = \u201clazy.\u201d He might assume that poor people must be lazing about in their bathrobes all day, and is implying that because you look \u201clazy\u201d in your bathrobe, you come off as one of those pesky poor people. Which is apparently an unacceptable impression to give off, even in the living room when no one is home.\n\nThat\u2019s if you want to stay with him at all after this, long enough to even figure that out. 3 months? And he\u2019s already policing your outfits? When you\u2019re not even leaving the house? I\u2019d be long gone. Me and my bathrobe are gonna stay here and watch tv in MY apartment, and you and your \u201cproductive\u201d outfit can gtfo. Byeee!", "I hosted my family for Christmas and dresses in a flying squirrel onesie after my shower.  My house, my rules.  If I want to wear pajamas in front of my siblings and parents, I'm going to.  My boyfriend thought it was funny & cute.\nNTA!", "NTA. Him getting aggravated over your wearing a robe for comfort & warmth on a designated lazy day is a meduim sized red flag. Arguing more about it & calling you an AH because you didn\u2019t compromise, aka  do what he told you, is a BIG red flag.  Keep your cozy robe & get rid of \nthe guy.", "Yup. This is the type of man who will complain that you \"let yourself go\" if you don't \"bounce back\" fast enough for his liking after giving birth (if that's something you choose to do), or just because your body dares to age over time.", "I think we both know who he been following on YouTube and TikTok. \ud83d\udea9\n\nOP, have you considered buying an expensive curler to assure you also have a sexy hairstyle daily? They make them easy to use now. And don't start your morning without a lipstick. You might look like you're in a comfort of your own home. \n\nAnd while you're at it, buy him a suit. Otherwise he might look like a slacker on a nice Sunday evening.", "Lounge clothes and a hooded vardi for me! Only cause I lost my beautiful, fluffy soft robe some years back with my storage unit.\n\nFuck people clothes!", "I have inside clothes and outside clothes. The second I come home, I\u2019m back in my jammies. If I\u2019m at home for a couple days, I shower daily, and change into a clean set. \n\nWhy would I be uncomfortable in my house?

What about it?\" \n\nI wear pj's and a robe, while doing business, all the time!", "I never wear a bra at home lol. Why would any man be outraged about not wearing a bra at home?", "I second this f*** people clothes!", "What\u2019s a vardi? Sorry if it\u2019s a typo but these days clothes get called funny names", "Cardi, probably. Cardigan.", "You were being lazy, and since it sounds like you have your own place you obviously aren't lazy all the time or you wouldn't be able to pay rent and buy the snacks you were munching. So look lazy proudly. My husband and I do well to even brush out hair on a lazy day.", "NTA...Lazy is for the holidays. WTF...who the hell gets mad over a robe.. at home?", "NTA. It also sounds a little like his idea of compromise in this situation was more of \u201cdo what I want and not what you\u2019re comfortable with\u201d kinda deal\u2026", "Lol NTA \u2014 I (jokingly) harass my partner for wearing jeans when we\u2019re lazing around the house, I can\u2019t imagine insisting anyone put on real clothes if they don\u2019t want to", "NTA.  This sounds like a variation on \"What will people say?\" where \"people\" means \"the anxieties in my head, because nobody is actually looking.\"\n\nAt least, I hope that's what it is.  Because the first alternative that comes to mind is \"You exist to be exactly what I like, and I don't like bathrobes.\"  But I hope that's not the case.", "NTA. That's some pretty controlling behavior by your boyfriend. Sorry, but I would prepare yourself for more. It probably comes from the way he was raised. Some people successfully 'deprogram' themselves as they gain independence and others don't.", "NTA - massive red flags with new boyfriend if he thinks he has ANY say in what your wear on your day off in your own apartment.  I would have zero tolerance for this.", "NTA. Am I the AH for thinking this guy sounds horrible?", "NTA. Would love to see what he thinks of me. In in my pjs and robe within minutes of returning home no matter what. It\u2019s gotten so bad that my kid asked me a little while ago why I was so dressed up when I was wearing jeans and a white t shirt. Apparently I\u2019ve lowered the bar so much that passes as fancy lol. Nobody should be made to feel bad for being comfy in their own home. If you can\u2019t feel at home there, the situation needs to change. Not you.", "NTA, and he sounds like a toddler. Who pitchs a fit over comfy clothing attire?", "NTA\n\nHe's already trying to control what you wear at home when no one but the two of you are there?\n\nHe's being extremely judgemental about your comfort?\n\nWhy keep him?", "NTA.... what \"compromise\" was there to be made??? Allow him to dictate your clothing choices, and comfort, in your own home.... or you do you.... easy decision, imo.....", "I think your boyfriend is jealous he doesn\u2019t have a fluffy robe himself /s\n\nNTA and I\u2019d break up with him. \n\nWhat happens when you get pregnant and you are too big and too hot to put clothes on? \n\nWhat happens if you have surgery and you are not presentable? \n\nYour boyfriend wants him to have a lazy day, but you still have to look insta-worthy? He is objectifying you and trying to control you.", "3 months and he doing this? Move on.", "NTA. You're in your own home. Are you decorative for his purpose, or are you living? He seems to think the former.", "NTA he has no right to tell you how to dress, much less in your own home and even less when you both planned a \"laze about\" and are dressed the same!\n\n\nYour bf is super weird. I wonder what other unreasonable expectations he has towards you... Like, is he going to be mad if you don't wear makeup or do your hair perfectly?", "NTA. There's something deeper to this. My friends bf HATES when she wears anything resembling a house dress or nightgown because it's what his mom wore when he was growing up. Doesn't matter how fashionable, new, stylized, etc it is. I'm guessing this situation is something similar to that. But my friend, this is major red flags and a good point to reevaluate everything before this continues on.", "What did he want you to do? Put on jeans and a sweater whole he got to wear sweatpants and a t-shirt? Hell. No! It's your apartment. If he has that big a problem with it, he can leave. Also, he is showing you a glimpse of your future here, OP. Do you really want to be with a man who dictates what you wear around your own home? Does his controlling nature stem out to other areas? Think about it, OP. NTA.", "Clearly NTA. Does he listen to Andrew Tate by any chance?", "Isn't that called \"a housecoat\"?", "NTA. Fluffy robes are the best!", "NTA but if you compromise and wear normal clothes, he should compromise and wear a Borat swimsuit.", "So long as you didn\u2019t have cold feet or gusts of cold air from below, why not?", "NTA", "If you stick with this three month old relationship keep in my mind that every time you are taking comfort in wearing your cuddly robe, BF finds you unattractive. \n\nEvery time you wear your cuddly, comfortable robe, he winces at the sight and sees you as  'lazy.'\n\nEvery time you are in your robe, 'he kind of hates it'.\n\nAnd this is only three months into the relationship.\n\nSorry, but I don't want to live with someone who looks at me and feels those things at the very sight of me.", "NTA. Only three months, eh? Sounds like he's giving you an opportunity to cut your losses early on.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sat here, at home, in slippers and a robe, feeling incredibly attacked.", "You are dating an asshole. Luckily you are only 3 months in. You deserve better than this, truly. Please respect yourself and dump him.", "Well in the antipodes it has been stinking hot so no one in my house has been fully clothed for days. Your boyfriend would die to learn all of us wear slippers inside and shock, horror, don't get dressed on lazy days.\n\nNTA. He's being a weirdo.", "\nIt was a perfect day to actually BE comfortable and lazy. I'd own it, lol. Your outfit was very appropriate.  I have but one question: are your pyjamas not warm enough? It would've been the perfect pyjama day... ( It was for us, so I may be a *little* biased, hehe)\n\nNTA  \n\nHis attitude was more damaging than your comfy robe", "NTA\n\ngirl drop him. That's. That's so shallow and petty. To get into an argument bad enough that it ruins your day, to get in argument in the first place about wearing a comfortable robe in your own home??? Regardless if there WERE guests. It's your home, you wear what you like. For context, weirdly enough, my girlfriend and I also had a stay at home Christmas Eve this year. It was cold, and she said \"baby, go grab my robe from the bathroom so you can have an extra layer\" I say this because it's an example of what a normal loving partner will do for you, instead of tear you down for \"looking lazy\" on literally an actual lazy day.", "NTA, kick him out of your home and break up. He's already trying to control you.", "NTA\nI have a fluffy robe that my mom gave me when I was pregnant with my first child.  I love it so much and use it during winter when I am home,\nI am working from home today and am wearing it as I type this (I remove it during video calls).  I also have on bear slippers my husband got me a couple years ago \ud83d\ude03", "F that nonsense.  Nta. Personally,  I don't wear a bra or pants for free.", "Also there was no compromise suggested in this situation. There was 1. wearing the robe or 2. not wearing the robe.

When I read the title I was thinking you were just wearing it (or it and pj's or some such)... and even in that case I would lean toward NTA at your own home and no guests coming.

Buy him a robe as a break up gift.", "I barely wear a bra outside the house let alone in the house.", "It's hard to objectify someone in a bulky robe.", "IME there is usually a positive response from my partner when I am free-boobin'.", "I'm sure there was a \"reason\", but really abusers just like looking for control/fights.\n\n\"You like doing this thing? If you loved me you wouldn't do it anymore.\"\n\nIf it wasn't, y'know, horrible, it'd be comical how pathetic their retroactive \"reasoning\" can be. In the bra case, I'm guessing cheating accusation. Maybe they'd call it disrespect, if they're a misogynist of some flavor.", "Can confirm this is plausible; when my wife is free-boobin\u2019, I respond positively."]}
