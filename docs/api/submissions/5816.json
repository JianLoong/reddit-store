Some things, one person is just plain wrong and needs to sit down and shut up. \n\nA lot of people (read: controlling assholes) like to throw around the \"compromise\" flag because it sounds reasonable and mature.

In my experience, this type of guy has very often got a misogynist father with strong opinions about how his mother should behave, and a mother who is either meek and accommodating or has internalized misogyny of her own. That, or he was raised by narcissists who reinforced to him that his opinions and preferences should always be given due deference, and that anyone resisting accommodating them is doing something wrong. OR sometimes they\u2019re just rich, and genuinely believe \u201cpoor\u201d = \u201clazy.\u201d He might assume that poor people must be lazing about in their bathrobes all day, and is implying that because you look \u201clazy\u201d in your bathrobe, you come off as one of those pesky poor people.
