It's also extra nice because it's FREEZING where I live.\n\nThe day started out fine, but after a few hours, my bf kept giving me weird looks before he finally asked me to take my robe off and put on \"normal\" clothes. I asked him what he meant, because we were both basically matching except for the robe (we both had on sweatpants and a sweater. I just had the extra robe). \n\nHe said the robe made me look lazy and he \"kind of hated it\". It's a totally new robe, so it's not like it was shabby, so I said no.

Heaven forbid you \"look lazy\" when you're having a lazy, relaxing day", "Clearly you're too lazy to date this piece of work and should dump him immediately. Make sure you wear the bathrobe when you do. NTA!", "NTA\n3 months in and he\u2019s trying to control what you wear, while in YOUR OWN HOME no less. It\u2019s comfy clothing, you\u2019re allowed to look, \u201clazy,\u201d when you\u2019re having a lazy day.\nI\u2019d seriously reconsider this relationship, especially if he\u2019s giving this much of a red flag this early on.", "NTA, dump him,", "NTA. But I wanna say good luck with this relationship if he gets angry over this then what else will he.", "NTA - your bf is being a brat over quite literally one of the most innocuous things ever. You're hurting no one -- in your OWN HOME! Wear that robe if it makes you happy and comfortable!", "NTA. He sounds controlling and this is such a weird thing for him to cause an argument over.", "NTA here's a compromise: he can wear what he wants on his own body and you can wear what you want on yours. He's showing you his true colors here on what he expects from you.", "NTA.. my wife wears a robe all day long in the winter because shes always freeezing!\n\nYour bf should want you to be comfortable.. he is the asshole.. already trying to control what you wear, goodness. Find a new bf, this one is not going to be a peaceful relationship", "NTA. My GF and I live very active lives (both hike 10+ miles every week, climb at least once a week, do yoga every week, blah blah blah) but every other week we take one weekend day to veg out and binge watch TV on the couch all day while eating crap. Robes are our exclusive attire for those days. They are comfy, you can adjust them if you\u2019re hot or cold, and great for cuddling. Who in their right mind would have an issue with a robe on a lazy day.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with wanting to be extra comfy in your own home. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s a problem considering you didn\u2019t have guests over.\n\nHaving a \u201clazy\u201d day sometimes is okay! I also love a good robe.", "NTA. \n\nYour house, your rules. You can wear whatever you feel comfortable in!", "NTA. I honestly don't care if you did wear it in front of guests or ran around in it butt naked underneath. Your butt, your clothing choices. That's not a compromise situation; it literally has nothing to do with him.\n\nI run around in pjs with fuzzy kitty slippers and a fuzzy capelet with a hood in winter. So snuggly without tangling my legs.", "NTA. It's a piece of clothing. Also, you both were, literally, lazing around together. Aren't you usually supposed to be in comfy clothes? I don't know why wearing a robe suddenly makes you lazy, or why he's complaining because it's not like you're at a 5 star restaurant, you're in the privacy of your own house! You should be allowed to wear what you want!", "This made me giggle. NTA, NTA, NTA. \n\nOnly because you said he accused you of being the AH because you wouldn\u2019t compromise. Compromise, to him, means doing what he is asking. \n\nIt\u2019s your home, he\u2019s a guest. He has no reason to boss you around. If he thinks you look lazy in a robe, I can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019s going to think on days where you\u2019re in pajamas, no makeup, just relaxing. \n\nI\u2019d have put on shorts and a tanktop (they are \u201cnormal\u201d!) and then put the robe over it all. Tell him you\u2019re compromising and wearing normal clothes like he asked! They\u2019re just under the robe you have every right to wear in your own home.", "NTA, I am currently in my robe. I come home from work the robe goes on. In certain zoom meetings I wear it also (some I have to look professional in) I have 4 robes right now. Robe number 5 is at my SILs to get fixed.

This is absolutely a hill I will die on!", "NTA and if he's not seeking to understand what makes you comfortable during relaxation/down time in your own home thats a massive red flag.", "NTA- I am literally wearing a robe right now while relaxing at home. If I'm at home, I have my robe on. My husband has never given me crap for it and actually buys me robes to wear. I can't believe he would expect you to 'compromise' (aka do what he wants since there wasn't any actual compromise) in your house. You be comfy and enjoy that robe and tell him to grow up and deal with it.", "Your boyfriend is a controlling and pretentious AH. You're NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s got a weird hang up about wearing anything resembling pjs all day meaning you\u2019re lazy, even on a day off, and you should believe him when he waves his red flags.", "NTA\n\nAnd you taking the robe off is not compromising, it's just doing what he wants. Honestly, kinda a major red flag that he feels the need to control what you wear in the comfort of your own home, especially if he gets mad over it", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to \u201ccompromise\u201d by being his paper doll. He\u2019s picking a fight with you *on Christmas* over his desire to control your appearance.", "NTA and it\u2019s pretty concerning that he is getting so worked up over you wearing a robe in the comfort of your own home.\n\nAlready showing red flags and it\u2019s only been 3 months\u2026 good thing is that it\u2019s only been 3 months, dump him and move on. Don\u2019t stay with someone like him, he is showing you what he is like and it\u2019s only going to get worse.", "NTA. I work from home and every day I change from my sleep PJs into my work PJs. You should be comfortable in your own home.", "NTA.. what? He's sitting there in sweat pants telling you that YOU look lazy?? Does this man not know what comfort looks like in your own house? \n\nThe day plan was to just relax at home. You should be comfortable doing that. \n\nHe's the only AH.", "NTA. Wtf? Throw him out. Nope. Coming into your house acting ridiculous. Boy bye.", "NTA but if you are then I am too! And I had guests in my house!  \n\nI have family staying with my spouse and I until new years day and today was our lazy day. I wore comfy clothes (t shirt and leggings) and a robe all day and no one said anything. My sister who got my the robe commented on how she loved how much I loved my new robe. \n\nYour boyfriend needs to relax and take a step back to stop projecting his issues onto you. If he thinks wearing a robe is lazy then he shouldn't wear it. It's not like your going to the grocery store in your robe and fuzzy slippers. You're allowed to be comfortable in your own home!", "NTA. \n\nHas he never heard of pyjama days? Wrapping yourself in a robe in your own home makes perfect sense to me.", "NTA. What did I just reead?? Keep the robes on, ditch the guy. Like, what? It's absolutely normal to wear a robe at home and it always has been.

Keep the robe.", "NTA, The Dude abides.", "the fuck did I just read OP?\nWhy are you dating a guy who cares about you looking \u201clazy\u201d at home when you are literally being lazy at home?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. How do you even compromise on that? Walk around with the robe on one arm? Just tie it around your waist? Use the tie as a headband, Rambo style?", "NTA you keep that robe on and he needs to keep the robe hate out. Honestly, as a member of the robe wearing citizenry of the world, he is just wrong. It\u2019s our fundamental right to wear a robe as we lay about our own homes in our SO\u2019s company at whatever time we want!", "NTA. He must've lost his whole mind.", "\u201cHe said I was an AH for not willing to compromise.\u201d\n\nCapitulation isn\u2019t compromise. NTA", "NTA. This reminds me of my ex. He was great until around the 3rd month of dating. That\u2019s when he started showing (slowly) controlling behavior, like this situation. It may seem small and petty now but if you continue to date, I hope you\u2019re keeping an eye out for additional controlling behavior.", "I wear my robe out in public because it\u2019s warm and I\u2019m not looking to impress anyone at the grocery store. NTA", "NTA. You guys agreed to have a lazy day in at home. You were both wearing appropriate attire for the occasion. I was expecting you to say you had people over after reading the title, because this otherwise makes no sense for him to be bothered by. My boyfriend stays in just his boxers and a t-shirt when we are home, at all times if nobody is over. I have no issue with this, you should be comfortable in your home. I would certainly call this a red flag, and an indication of more controlling behavior to come in the future. Perhaps you\u2019re lucky he has shown this side so early on in this relationship - easier for you to cut ties.", "NTA. He\u2019s being ridiculous. You can be comfortable in your own home (even if it was a ratty robe). I really can\u2019t comprehend digging in on not wanting someone to wear a robe in their own home on a lazy, chill day.", "If he is so offended by wearing a robe, he definitely shouldn't wear one. You, however, get to wear whatever you want!\nNTA.", "NTA. But he is a HUGE AH. I have been in pjs all day except when I ran to Starschmucks earlier. What the hell does it matter how you are dressed in the comfort of your own home?", "Nta", "NTA. Why do YOU need to adjust to fit his compromise? Your house your rules. I had a similar argument before with an ex. He became an ex because he wanted to change me \"for the better.\"\n\nHe either accepts all of you for who you are or you move on to someone better. Nobody gets to dictate you how you want to live your life, clothes included.\n\nAlso, this guy seriously got all mad over an article of clothing? HUGE red flag sweetheart.", "NTA even if you had on only the robe that would be totally fine and normal for a day of nothingness (I was going to say a lazy day but you soon-to-be ex made that a negative word when it shouldn't be).\nA day of nothing is totally robe appropriate. It would be the same as saying someone curled up on the couch with a blanket was bad, a robe is like a blanket. You wear what you want, be comfortable.", "Lol he's ridiculous did you really even need to ask no not the asshole at all", "NTA. Tell him it's your house and it's not a \"robe\" it's a dressing gown, much more fancy and now mandatory.  Arthur Dent survived several years Hitchhiking the Galaxy wearing his dressing gown.", "Huh.  That's weird.  It wasn't the sweats that set this off it was the robe over- I find that odd.  NTA.  Imo, though, this relationship being so new, this is still the time where you are discovering if you are compatible and that looks like a negatory.", "NTA\n\nKept the robe, ditch the dude.", "NTA but people who get dressed even when they aren't going anywhere because they don't want to be \"lazy\" are just are psychopaths.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some things you need to come to a compromise on. Some things, one person is just plain wrong and needs to sit down and shut up. \n\nA lot of people (read: controlling assholes) like to throw around the \"compromise\" flag because it sounds reasonable and mature.
