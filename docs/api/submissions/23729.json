Moved in with the FIL & SIL with the FIL\u2019s blessing. His house. Sold our house, and moved in. The MIL passed a while back. \r  \n\r  \nWe have 3 potty trained dogs, and never have issues with them. Trained them myself. SIL has a smaller dog that she will not potty train.

Even found two piles of poop under the wife\u2019s old bed crusted to the carpet.   The FIL fortunately agreed that it was best to have it all professionally cleaned before we moved in seeing as it\u2019s a health hazard and is very uncomfortable to live in. The SIL didn\u2019t offer to help pay for that. We did, but he declined because our financial future is a bit tighter. \r  \n\r  \nThe SIL lays out multiple pee pads everywhere in the kitchen/living area (all hardwood downstairs) and makes everyone walk on/around them. It\u2019s gated off from upstairs now. When the dog pees on a pad, she won\u2019t pick it up and replace it immediately if there\u2019s more room for more pee on it. Typically me, the FIL, or wife have to. \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s worth adding that she goes to bed around 10 pm, but won\u2019t get up till about 8 am to attempt to let her dog out, so there\u2019s typically a couple piles of poop and urine that my wife and I end up cleaning up. We have to since we are up at 6 to get our soon ready for daycare and working by 8 in the home office. The FIL has been in cleanup detail until we arrived. He told me he does it \u201cbecause he loves his daughter\u201d.... \r  \n\r  \nShe only feeds it when it\u2019s convenient, and never makes a point to responsibly feed it. She assumes her dad will do it. She rarely feeds it in the mornings, and the FIL will ask us if we fed it, which we don\u2019t. Even as i wrote this, the FIL assumed she didn\u2019t feed it again, fed it, then the SIL fed it dinner a second time. \r  \n\r  \nAll this being said, we keep our 3 dogs in the office with us and they don\u2019t use the restroom inside. We let them out every couple of hours for our breaks and feed our dogs ourselves. We also don\u2019t let them upstairs where all the carpet is unless it\u2019s time for bed in our room. They are our responsibility and we love and take care of them. \r  \n\r  \nThe SIL is upset that we won\u2019t allow her dog in the office (she uses it 2x a week hybrid) but keep ours in there with us. My wife and I don\u2019t want dog feces in the office that we have to work out of. Not to mention, it has low profile carpet that was also just cleaned when the upstairs was.\r  \n\r  \nI might add that our dogs will whine if they can\u2019t chill with us in the office while we work. The SILs dog could care less. So it helps keep the noise down to not annoy the retired FIL that likes to enjoy TV in the pee pad living room and us.\r  \n\r  \nSo..

I feel bad for you FIL with paying to have it professionally cleaned before and now it's the same problem. Your SIL is going to end up having animal control called on her.", "NTA, and ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww for SIL expecting her untrained dog to be allowed in your work space.  A dog she seems to care about only when convenient for her.", "NTA, but your top priority should be saving to move out. Don't invest more money and time into this property. It's a lost cause without the actual homeowner's support.", "NTA.   However.... I suggest that you do some things to help train the dog.  Small dogs live a long time, and if she ever loses interest and wants to rehome, housetraining is a must.\n\nStart with crate training.   Should be a smallish, cave like safe place for the dog.   Most dogs will not eliminate in their crate.   \n\nWork on the house training too...in the long run I predict that this dog will become yours/FIL's.   You three  will be MUCH happier, even if still not happy with SIL.   \n\nAnd under no circumstances allow her to get another dog.", "FIL just paid to professionally clean the upstairs carpet.\n\nSIL's dog is not patty trained and will pee and poop anywhere.  \n\nIt is an office that you  use to work.  Most people, would not want it to smell of pee  or poop.\n\nSIL should thave trained the dog when it was puppy.  Training takes time and effort.\n\nYou put in that effort for your dogs, and they are potty trained.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019d personally rehome her dog since she\u2019s neglecting it. It\u2019s worth pissing her off imo. 13 years old though? Might be kinder to let the dog take the big sleep rather than trying to find a senior a new home. If the dog is now unable to hold its bladder but was previously, I\u2019d take it to the vet to see if it\u2019s a health issue then I\u2019d consider if it\u2019s a decline in quality of life.\n\nIf it\u2019s never been house trained your SIL sucks and should never be around another animal. I bet if it was a big dog she probably wouldn\u2019t let it crap and piss in the house but small dogs are not treated like dogs and it\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nIf you weren\u2019t living together I\u2019d just tell you to steal the dog. Either way, stop doing it for her, collect evidence and report her.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu can not really keep her from bringing her dog in when she works int he office, it is HER home as much as yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was foul. It also pointed to some other major issues. I wasn't surprised when she decided she didn't feel like paying off her $100k in credit card debt and just stopped making payments. \n\nNTA.

Guess you get to use SIL room whenever you want as well. Hell, why not just take her food to while you're at it? Lay down and relax in her bed?"]}
