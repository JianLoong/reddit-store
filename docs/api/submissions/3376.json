We have known each other since 1994 and throughout these 28 years, she has been my best friend. We have the kind of friendship where we are totally honest with each other and say if one of us being unreasonable or a bitch or anything but we also have each other\u2019s backs. I couldn\u2019t ask for someone more loyal. We also insult each other all the time, but not in a mean way, more like in a loving joke way. For example, I made the mistake once wearing a peach dress which she lovingly called my vomit dress. She once wore a dark green skirt and I referred to her as princess fiona looking for her Shrek. Her comment made me laugh and my comment made her laugh. I don\u2019t do this with anyone else, only her as I understand people have different humour and our interactions could be misconstrued as bitchy and insensitive.\n\nSandy and I currently have a bet going on who can go the longest without shaving. We\u2019re both obsessed with our own vanity which we\u2019ve always confessed to, which we rib each other about, so it\u2019s been a fun challenge. Whoever loses has to take the victor out for dinner. It\u2019s been a few weeks. Her boyfriend and my husband don\u2019t give two shits about this tbh.\nWe were hanging out together with 2 other friends and one of their girlfriend\u2019s, Dina. We\u2019ve only met her a few times but she is very nice and a sweet woman. We were all kind of talking amongst each other and Sandy and I started talking about our bet on a progress update. I rolled up my leggings so only she could see to show my legs are pretty hairy and she said my legs looked like her dad on beach day. She then rolled up her jeans to show me her lower leg and I called her Wookie. No feelings were hurt and we just burst out laughing. Anyway, Dina heard our whole exchange and said mocking each other isn\u2019t cool. She said it\u2019s a woman\u2019s choice whether or not she wants to shave and we shouldn\u2019t be \u2018passively aggressively being bitchy to one another.\u2019 Basically, she accused us of backstabbing each other but disguising it as backhanded compliments and that as women, we should better support each other.\n\nSandy and I explained our bet and said that this is literally our friendship and that it\u2019s not that deep. I said as nicely as I could that I get she probably mistook our humour as something else as she hasn\u2019t been around us much but that she can\u2019t be accusing us of subtly hating each other and not supporting fellow women. She went really quiet and was clearly embarrassed. She, along with our 2 other friends were all silent for a while until Dina asked Sandy and I to apologise. Sandy said no as she didn\u2019t feel like she had anything to apologise for and I agreed saying it was an inside joke between us and Dina grossly took it out of context.\n\nThis kind of soured the mood so Sandy and I left.

Why do you still care\u201d\n\nPs please update with who won the bet lol", "NTA\n\nDina has issues. You aren't bitching or hating on other women. You talking about each other *to* each other. You've been good friends for 28 years- I would say that being incredibly supportive of other women. If you had made fun of a woman who doesn't shave who isn't part of your game or behind her back, that would make you an AH. But given you clearly aren't hurting anyone's feelings by what you say about *each other to each other*, Dina is just being a pill. Her idea of supporting women sounds exhausting and boring.", "NTA you explained politely and clearly & nothing was directed towards her if she\u2019s offended it sounds like a her problem not a you problem , you apologize for this believe me this will be the start of a long list of things you\u2019ll have to apologize for as this woman will be \u201coffended\u201d by many things", "NTA! \"Those\" types of feminists literally look for reasons to be offended. They suck the joy out of every situation, especially if it doesn't concern them. I have a friendship exactly like yours and Sandy's, and yall were way nicer than we would have been. Treasure Sandy's friendship, because she'll help you bury the body!", "NTA. Dina probably doesn\u2019t shave by choice and took it as you making fun of all women who choose to remain hairy. She\u2019s probably super fun at parties.", "NTA\nIf you had used one of these \"insults\" on someone other than Sandy then sure, I can understand and support someone calling it out. Dina should've just dropped it when you explained it's just part of your friendship, like so many other friendships out there. She made things more awkward for everyone by asking for an apology when there was no need.", "NTA, it was a thing between you and Sandy that Dina didn\u2019t know a thing about. If anything, Dina should apologize for sticking her nose where it didn\u2019t belong.", "NTA. You have nothing to apologize for. Some people need to relax.", "NTA", "NTA. I appreciate Dina trying to support other women and advocate for them. However, context is so important. Sure sometimes people laugh when nervous but when you two stated it was a bet and it\u2019s the nature of your relationship it should\u2019ve been dropped. To tell you she wants an apology is ridiculous.", "NTA you sound like good friends and I would love to have a friendship like that", "NTA- Dina ought to know NOT to insert herself in other people's business/conversations- much less to judge them and make accusations.  so, yeah, I'd apologize like this... Hey, Dina, I'm really sorry you decided to insert yourself in to a conversation between bff's that you completely misread and then decided to embarrass yourself by getting all judgey and then feeling awkward when called out. Yep, really sorry about all that.", "Maybe best to keep your inside joke between the two of you? NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA. My bff and I gave the same dynamic. When you know someone so long, there is a level of comfort and honesty and it is the best.

That\u2019s funny. An onlooker, if she had a sense of humor, should have made a funny comment and let it go.", "Your exchange sounds perfectly normal and far from unique.", "Jeez I mean unique in the sense that it\u2019s between me and Sandy.
