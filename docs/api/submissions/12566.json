My girlfriend (F25) had asked what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to watch my favorite movie trilogy, LOTR. I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing. \n\nBut I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all. \n\nThe third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home. \n\nA few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up.

Honestly, how did you think it was going to go? Like if she isn\u2019t interested in the movies, was she really going to spend 9 hours of focused watching? It seems like she was a pretty good sport all things considered.", "All 3 of them? Clocking in at a runtime of over 9 hours? YTA", "YTA\n\nYou knew she didn't like the movies. You asked her to watch them with you, and she sat on a couch next to you while you enjoyed your favorite movies. You can't get mad at someone for being uninterested in something. \n\nMy husband sat through all the Harry Potter movies. He's not a fan. He just hung out with me while I geeked out, and I appreciated it. She spent your birthday with you, doing what you wanted to do.  Sounds like she made an effort to make you happy imo. \n\nHappy late birthday", "YTA. I want you to just think for a minute a movie that you watched  that you REALLY did not enjoy. Now, imagine that your girlfriend asked you to watch that really long (what's it like 7-8 hours) movie for her birthday. If you can honestly tell me that you wouldn't fidget, fall asleep, get on your phone or zone out to think of something/anything else during that movie, then you're the most patient person on the planet and I commend you, sir. \n\nBut the fact is that you picked an activity you knew your girlfriend would not enjoy and then wanted her to sit, raptly entranced by the wonder that is LOTR for a really long time. She was sitting with you. She was doing quiet activities. She wasn't making fun of the movie or saying how stupid it was (that would have made her the AH). She wanted to spend time with you even though the activity you picked wasn't something she enjoyed.\n\n I absolutely loath sports on the tv, but I sit with my partner while he watches it and crochet or read while it's going on. It doesn't mean I don't like him. In fact, it means I really like him that I want to be near him enough to put up with football. Try to see it that way. Your girlfriend likes you enough that she'll sit by you while you watch something she doesn't like.", "YTA. Over 11 hours?! You expected her to suck up half a day actively watching a trilogy you knew she didn\u2019t like? For the sake of your birthday? That\u2019s insanity. If it was ONE of the movies, I could see you being upset, but holy moly, all three?! Did you two discuss expectations before agreeing to this? Did you tell her you expected her undivided attention for 11 hours so she could gracefully nope out or offer a compromise? \n\nYou went over to her place because you like her couch, which she was cool with, for the entirety of your LOTR marathon. You knew full darned well she wasn\u2019t keen on the trilogy, but somehow you still expected her undivided attention? She was bored out of her skull, but was quiet about it. She didn\u2019t tap out and ask you to leave. YOU were the one annoyed with HER, while camped out on HER couch. She was keeping herself occupied on her phone while you watched your favorite movies. The woman is a saint. \n\nBut you, the birthday boy, got all bent out of shape because she messed around in her phone and drank two bottles of whine, er, wine, to cope with/accommodate your 11 hour marathon. She fell asleep and you immaturely left without saying a word. The goal should have been to spend time hanging out together for your birthday, which, honestly, was accomplished. You could have very well watched all of that in your own, on your own time in the comfort of your own home. You cannot monopolize half of someone\u2019s day when they feel obligated for the sake of it being your birthday, and then dictate how they cope with boredom. That is torture.", "YTA. Your favorite movies are your favorites, not hers, and you even acknowledged that she doesn't like them. Now you're pouting because she didn't enjoy being subjected to watching hours of those films? Would you have been attentive and enthralled if she lined up a day of watching Beaches, Fried Green Tomatoes, Sleepless in Seattle, etc.?", "YTA I get that it's your birthday, and you can do what you want. But you knew she had seen the movies and she didn't really care for them. The fact that she was even willing to sit there with foe you for approximately 9 hours is a testament to her patience. Getting mad because she wasn't paying attention is dramatic. If you wanted to spend actual time with her, maybe you should have picked a different activity. Flip it around. How would you feel if you had to sit through 9 hours of movies you don't like?", "YTA. I thought the point was spending all day and part of the night being in her company. No, you want her to watch a few movies she's already seen in a genre she couldn't care less for? Come on man. She cared enough for you to try, then quietly sat there next to you. Try calling her again.", "YTA\n\nShe's seen them before and she didn't like them, yet she agreed to be there with you while you watch them on your birthday without complaint. Why does it matter if she's paying attention? What do you gain from that except the validation of forcing someone to pay attention to something you like for however long that bloody trilogy is? I mean, that is *not* a small amount of time she dedicated to being there with you despite you both knowing she would get nothing from it. You are kinda ungrateful and controlling.\n\nNot to mention the way you just let yourself get angrier and angrier about it until you stormed out without saying anything. She's right. You could stand to grow up.", "YTA. Listen, I love LOTR. We dedicated a whole cozy day to watch the EXTENDED EDITIONS. But my husband and I both enjoy it. \n\n1. You knew she wasn\u2019t interested \n2. You went to HER place \n3. Its 9+ hours of screen time \n\nI would check out on any Stars Wars, Stars Trek, or  horror related movies and my husband knows this\u2026 so he doesn\u2019t obligate or get his feelings hurt when I scroll. \n\nAnd she\u2019s right, you\u2019re too damn old to act this way.", "YTA. You know she doesn\u2019t like them already, and yet you want her to sit through 9 hours of them? Smh. Honestly the fact that she was able to him out until the third movie is impressive. You do need to grow up, you\u2019re lucky she even agreed without complaint. 9 hours is a looong time even for a franchise you like. \n\nAlso off topic but hot take: I feel like movies are  not a great way to spend time with someone, proper movie etiquette usually means you stare at a screen and not talk\u2026", "YTA \n\nYou not only asked her to watch 9 hours straight of movies she doesn't like, you wanted her to be excited about it. She probably tried at first but it was just too much for her. \n\nThink about being asked to watch and pay attention for that long during a movie marathon of something you dislike. How about 9 commercial free hours of golf and you have to look at the TV without looking away?\n\nIt was too much to expect. And you got pissed.", "YTA\n\nI only say this because you chose to watch an extremely long trilogy\u2026\n\nI\u2019m betting your gf is like me and assumed her presence was enough, regardless of whether or not she was actively watching LOTR with you\n\nI mean, you truly expected her to sit there and stare at a screen displaying something she doesn\u2019t enjoy for roughly **11 hours**?", "If I had a boyfriend that wanted to watch these movies for his birthday, I\u2019d probably do it. But sir\u2026.I\u2019m 48. I like to sit.", "YTA that\u2019s several hours of movies she doesn\u2019t like. That has to be agonizing. And I like lotr.", "YTA birthday boy  it is like 10 hours of movies.  More if you pause for bathroom breaks and food.  She stayed with you to watch them.  You know she did not like them.  Do you think having rewatch them again will make her like them. She was board and played on her phone and had some wine.  Be happy she and you were alone.", "You went to her house, sat on her couch, \n spent hours and hours watching what you wanted.  From your telling, she never protested or complained, she completely accommodated you.  Especially if she doesn\u2019t even like these movies, she sounds like a class act.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been in this relationship, but there isn\u2019t a point where you get to control her eyeballs.  Adjust your expectations and save the indignation for something real.\n\nYTA", "Sorry man, YTA. You can't expect someone who doesn't like Lord of the Rings to freaking marathon all 3 movies. You best brush off your best apology and bring her a bottle of wine. She drank all of hers, apparently lol", "YTA you wanted her company while you watched your favorite movies, knowing she doesn't enjoy them. Yet she gave you the time and company. I am on her side.", "YTA. Also a child at 28 years old! Use your words and communicate instead of throwing a tantrum like a child. \n\nYou knew she didn\u2019t like the movies yet obligated her to watch it with you. You didn\u2019t take her disinterest as a hint at the first movie and went in to watch all 3 movies!! Grow up", "Soft YTA. Plenty of people multitask through movies and TV shows, especially ones they've already seen or that can be slow like LotR. And if she'd paid full attention, what would you have gotten out of it? Another meh if you asked if she liked it better this time? Did you expect a heady discussion of movies she's not that interested in?\n\nBut the biggest AH moves were not saying anything about being miffed and, biggest of all, leaving without saying anything. Communication is key. Though I will say that her calling you an AH is unproductive.", "YTA. My ex husband was like this. No matter what he was watching (any time, not birthdays) he wanted me to sit there and stare at the screen, laugh at appropriate times, smile when he glanced at me. Ugh.", "YTA.  If it was just one movie, I might have thought she was rude.  But she knew she had an entire day ahead of her of dull movie watching. I am surprised she didn\u2019t start drinking until the 2nd movie. \n\nIt is one thing to get special treatment on your birthday.  It is another thing entirely to expect someone to waste 7+ hours watching movies you already know they dislike.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you watch them on your own?  What did forcing her to be there do for you but gratify your ego?  Grow up.", "Omg. My husband could have totally written this about me. I\u2019m happy to sit in the room with him and snuggle up together while he watches and I read my book, but I could not possibly care less about those movies. (I also like my wine.) \n\nIf he asked me to watch ONE, I\u2019d suffer through it. But a movie marathon of a series you KNOW she dislikes? Is your birthday wish for her to just suffer in front of you for a whole day?\n\nNot voting as I\u2019m curious now to see if I\u2019m TA in my own marriage! \ud83d\ude02", "YTA don\u2019t you know the ongoing joke is that girls will ask their partners to watch movies with them and then fall asleep except for you and vice versa you asked her and she fell asleep. Most people just laugh this off and make a joke about it you are taking this to the whole new level. I fall asleep all the time watching shows, you wanted to have a relaxing movie night that\u2019s exactly what she did. She did. What was a relaxing movie night for her popped a few bottles of wine kick back and relax and happen to fall asleep. You got your panties all up in a bunch I think you need to apologize to her.", "YTA - expecting someone to watch nearly 12 hours of a movie series she doesn't really like? And she stayed and all she did was fall asleep in hour... 8? \n\njfc man have a heart!", "I might\u2019ve been on your side in a normal circumstance, but ELEVEN HOURS STRAIGHT is an unhinged expectation to have of someone outside the lotr nerdom. (Especially considering she\u2019s SEEN them already!) If it was about spending quality time together, you would have chosen something you both could enjoy. Sure, it\u2019s your birthday and you can choose to watch whatever you want\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t natural consequences to your dumb choice.\nEdited to add: YTA", "YTA. She did her best and those are very long movies I imagine even longer to those to dislike them. You coulda just been grateful.", "YTA. This is not an activity you ask of someone who isn't an excited participant.", "YTA. \n\n28 years old. Honestly hard to fathom how you could be this clueless at that point in your life.", "YTA\n\nYou graduated magna cum laude from the acade-me-me-ME!, didn't you? You knew she doesn't really care about the movies but wanted to watch at her place because of the big screen. She sat by you despite not caring about it (and I get it bc meh) and scrolled through her phone to pass the time. If you wanted to share this with people sharing your enthusiasm you should have just done that, maybe your gf would have even given you permission to use her location and it could have been special. Your gf doesn't have to fake in interest in somethnig you KNOW she's not interested in", "This is either ESH or NAH but I'm kinda tending towards ESH because why dont you talk to each other about your relationship?", "ESH. It\u2019s not very thoughtful of her to ask what you wanted to do for your birthday and then immediately disregard that you wanted to do this together.\n\nIt\u2019s also dumb that you sat there and stewed about it for 7 hours rather than just say something.", "Honestly, if my partner was completely uninterested in my favorite anything, I'd be happy that they agreed to even sit through them with me, even if they stayed on their phone the whole time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe gift is her company, but what did you expect? That she would genuinely love them for the day? What's the big deal about being on her phone? For that, you get a You The You-know, BUTTTTT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe drank herself into a blackout in a few hours? On the couch? Is that unusual behavior for her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, ESH but not for the reason you asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think that you two sound compatible, from the perspective you've just written?", "I'm... going to go with ESH.  I absolutely get wanting someone to be engaged with your favorite stories, I do.  If we were talking about one movie, I would say this is on her - Asking somoene to be focused on a movie as a birthday present is not that huge a deal and she could have declined.  You probably however, should have read the room and noticed \"hey, she's REALLY not engaged or interested, maybe pushing through 9 hours of a thing she clearly doesn't like is not the way to go\"", "ESH. I would have been bored to tears. She shouldn't have agreed to that, but you KNEW she finds those movies blech and expected her to watch those long ass movies anyway.", "ESH. Don't get me wrong, my husband and I love LoTR, but those are loooooong movies and to watch all 3 back to back, especially for someone not into it, that's a huge commitment.  She could've tried harder but you could be more understanding.", "I'm gonna go with NAH. You wanted to watch LoTR. She didn't. She did what she could to make it enjoyable for both of you without being negative. It could've been salvaged with grace and communication and luckily for y'all it seems like it still can. For a bigger problem I might say ESH but this time for such a little issue it's a firm NAH", "ESH. She didn't engage with you on your birthday and you threw a tantrum.", "No, you're NTA. I don't get all the YTA votes, because she asked what you wanted to do. Asked and answered, and AGREED to. Not the asshole. (Although those movies suck, my guy.)", "So.. I can kinda get why you were annoyed... But you knew those weren't her fave... So why not make it a whole experience to make it a bit enjoyable for both of you all. \n\nI say this as someone who is currently planning an at home movie day for my own husband on his birthday next but instead of just sitting on the couch like usually... I'm building a pillow bed on the floor... Providing movie theme snacks and such.. But in general just trying to make it more if a true movie experience... \n\n\n.... I'm saying next time... Even though she hates the movie... Maybe you both could think of ways to jazz it up a bit so she won't be completely bored... And you can engage her throughout the experience so both of you can be somewhat happy.", "ESH. Suggesting the whole trilogy when you know she doesn\u2019t care for the movies is a little ridiculous. At the same time, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to watch them all with you if she didn\u2019t want to. I feel like this all could\u2019ve been avoided if y\u2019all just communicated better.", "You're both at fault here. You, for asking her to throw away her whole day on movies you already know she doesn't like. Her, for agreeing and then not sticking with her agreement. Your girlfriend is not your conjoined twin. You could have asked someone else to watch the movies with you--someone who would enjoy doing that--and then got together with your girlfriend for dinner, for instance. And when you asked her, she could have politely declined to watch the movies. Which would have been a much better way to handle it than hanging on her phone and getting drunk.", "NTA \n\nIt was YOUR birthday. YOUR birthday. She asked what you wanted to do. You said you wanted to do this one thing. \n\nShe was rude. \n\nIt's not hard to sit through a movie or series you don't really care for, when the other person is someone you care for . \n\nI would really reconsider this relationship.  Not because she's not into LOTR, but because of how horrible she acted during it. Fuck, she could have at least said no and let you watch them on your own, then done something special with you.", "NTAH. I don't like those movies either. (huge respect  to Peter Jackson)  It was your birthday!  You can't expect her to like them but she could let you watch without being upset. \n\nI'd just be happy you wanted to share your birthday with me and I'd hope my girlfriend would be too. \n\nBe well!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you opt for the extended editions (11+ hours)?\n\nI love LotR, and you, my dude, are giving us LotR nerds a bad reputation.", "YTA. Sorry, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s your birthday, 9+ hours of movies you know she doesn\u2019t like, and expecting her undivided attention is ridiculous and unfair.", "Imagine if you asked your partner how they would like to spend their birthday together and they choose 9+ hours of staring at a screen. \n\nYta, do you even want to have a girlfriend? Maybe you'd be better off not having to waste time talking to her", "YTA. You asked her to spend HOURS- and entire day- watching movies you know she wouldn\u2019t enjoy.

As it happens, I just watched the entire LOTR extended edition trilogy (all 12 hours of it) last Saturday with my sister and some friends. I'm a big LOTR fan, but that is a HUGE time commitment even if you enjoy them. Most of the friends we were watching with were in and out, and didn't stay for the whole marathon because they had other commitments. (And yes, though I stayed for the whole thing, I was on my phone/ laptop for some of the time!)\n\nIt was incredibly kind of your girlfriend to keep you company for so long while you were watching movies that you enjoy and that she doesn't. Asking her to be riveted to them for that long is a bridge too far. Next time why don't you find something to do with her that you both enjoy, and save your obsessions that she doesn't share for your own time and couch?", "You made this woman watch 11 hours of movies that you know she didn't like and got mad that she wasn't into it?

Asking her to watch ONE of them with you would have been understandable but the entire trilogy? Dude, come on. No one wants to sit through 9+ hours of a movie they don't enjoy.

This wasn't a couple hours at a party where she doesn't know anyone.\n\nThat being said, if she was going to agree to watch, she should have tried harder to be polite. Only lasting 10 minutes before forgoing manners is a little ridiculous for an adult.

She's a bigger person than I am for even agreeing to it the first place. If I were her and you suggested that I would have been honest and said that even though it's your birthday, I just honestly don't like those movies and it wasn't going to be an enjoyable experience for either of us.

She didn't even turn it off, walk away, or tell you she's bored. No, she continued on THROUGH PART III. \n\nBored AF. But kind enough to humor your request without complaint. \n\nAnd you threw a giant baby-ass tantrum. \n\nGrow up. Appreciate what an amazing, kind, caring partner you have, and get your head out of your ass.", "My family has a tradition where we have a Harry Potter movie marathon at Christmas and I added a LOTR extended edition for Thanksgiving. It's been understood that this is an opt-in/volunteer thing only. No one should be forced to sit through let alone PAY ATTENTION to the entire thing. Movie watching should not be a chore. \n\nYTA and you probably made her hate LOTR even more now.", "As someone who thought all of LOTR was a complete boring drag (Kevin Smith was right, it's movies about walking) and sat through them all for 9 hours with a boyfriend ONCE.... and you're making her do it again...dude, she was trying to stick with watching it and just could not. She was trying to suck it up for your birthday and make it less boring for her what with the phone and the wine.", "YTA. That's like 9 hours of movie, Dude. Spending the day with you is one thing. But you can't force your likes on people. Why were you testing her like that?", "When my partner wants to watch a movie that he loves and I don't like, I will sit with him on the couch with headphones on and scroll on my phone. He likes that I am sitting there with him even if I'm not watching and we will hold hands the whole time. She doesn't have to like the same movies as you and her sitting with you while you watch them should be enough in my opinion. My partner does the same for me and I couldn't care less if he's on his phone or not", "Dude I LOOOOOOVE LOTR and this is massively YTA behavior. What difference does it make if she\u2019s on her phone? She was there with you while you watch 9 ish hours of movies she doesn\u2019t even like? YTA, YTA, YTA!", "INFO: would you have been fine with it if she engaged with the movies by asking questions about the characters, commenting on the outfits, talked about the landscape of New Zealand, or similar trivial conversations to try to find interest in the films?", "These replies are\u2026 disappointing. OP, NTA. You chose an activity that YOU enjoy to celebrate YOUR birthday. You can\u2019t expect her to enjoy the films as much as you do, but she could have opted not to watch them with you, or come up with a different activity with you, if she felt she couldn\u2019t sit through it.\n\nI don\u2019t blame her for going on her phone, because that\u2019s an extremely long runtime and I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t get fidgety too. But the fact that, within the first 10 minutes, she was already showing a complete lack of interest in you, just seems rude. She didn\u2019t even TRY to act interested, in an activity you chose that *she agreed to participate in*, to celebrate ***YOUR*** birthday. I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong for being upset about that.\n\nAs for everyone saying OP is in the wrong, let me try and explain how he is feeling. Imagine you love pizza, and you want to go to pizza hut with your friend to celebrate your birthday. Your friend doesn\u2019t like pizza, but he accepts the invite, as it\u2019s your birthday after all. When you get there, you dig right in. You are enjoying your food already. Your friend, however, is not eating, he\u2019s not talking to you much, he\u2019s sitting looking bored and miserable. He pulls out his phone and starts doing something else, pretty much dismissing the fact you\u2019re out for dinner. When he does eat, he\u2019s doing it in limited amounts and is visibly fed up and you can tell he just wants to leave.\n\nNow, you might have had an enjoyable meal, you might also be very grateful that your friend came despite not liking pizza, but you\u2019re still going to be upset that, during an event that was supposed to be to celebrate your birthday, the friend you invited didn\u2019t even try to enjoy the activity, nor did he show the slightest bit on interest in it. You will still feel upset about it, even though you\u2019re grateful he came. That\u2019s how OP feels. He\u2019s upset that his girlfriend did not even ***try*** to show an interest.\n\nHe isn\u2019t the asshole. You could maybe say she isn\u2019t either because it was inevitable she\u2019d get fidgety, but that would make it NAH, OP did nothing wrong here. This sub baffles me sometimes.", "Im confused on the YTAs here. This is an NTA or at the very least ESH.  OP, ignore the ytas. OP, i do think you overdid it with all three in one sitting, maybe one wouldve been good, and you shouldve been more communicative with your gf. Key thing here is she agreed to watching, and from the start she wasnt present. Its your bday, which means we do what you want to do. Men do this all the time for women, not too sure why the same cant be extended to men.  But yes, all three? OP. Chill out next time.", "Clearly in the minority here but NTA.

She isn't the girl for you if she isn't even willing to entertain something you like on your birthday just because she isn't interested.", "NTA. It was YOUR BIRTHDAY. I get those movies are long, and as I\u2019m not a fan of them myself, I probably wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve wanted to stick through all three either, but from the start she didn\u2019t give a rats to at least watch just one with you? Seems pretty shitty, I would\u2019ve left too, might as well have stayed home and watched them alone.\nThe whole point was to watch a movie *together*, I think everyone is missing the point here because they don\u2019t like LOTR? \ud83d\ude05", "NTA. I would hate to watch all 3 of those movies back to back.

You asked her for about nine hours of undivided attention to something she doesn't like. That's a big ask, even for a birthday. Yes, your birthday is about you, but if you want other people to participate, asking them to do something they  dislike for attentive hours on end is ridiculous.\n\nShe also shouldn't have agreed, knowing how long they are.\n\nYou guys need to find something you enjoy together.", "NTA. People do stuff they don't like for people they care about.

Everyone\u2019s entitled to their own likes and dislikes. Your girlfriend made you aware previously that she\u2019s not nearly as interested in it as you are, and you still expected her to sit through the entire trilogy, regular or extended, in one night without getting distracted?

I understand though why her being on her phone and going through an more than an entire bottle of wine would be upsetting in this case. Not only can it be distracting to you when you\u2019re at least trying to focus on the movie, but you two were doing this for a special occasion. It\u2019s fine that she\u2019s not a fan of the trilogy and might not be 100% attentive the whole way through, but she could have at least tried to be more invested for one night on your birthday. She was the one who asked how you particularly wanted to celebrate after all, she could have planned some other activity instead if she had other birthday ideas in mind. She did agree to watch them with you to begin with which I guess is a better compromise than nothing, but being constantly on her phone from the beginning and getting likely pretty drunk for most of it seems like a sub-par level of effort.\n\nI probably would\u2019ve left too if I were you, but I would have made it less about focusing on the movies themselves and more about how the fact that she didn\u2019t try to focus period made you feel like an inconvenience/annoyance on your own birthday after she agreed to celebrate with you this way in the first place.", "Unpopular opinion but NTA. I mean watching the movies with you is not sitting beside you and getting her mind anywhere else.. for that you would enjoy more watching them on your own without seeing how much she didn't  want to do it. She could have said to do something else instead of yes lets watch movies (only you will I will scroll on mu phone) and it was your birthday, dedicating the time to really see the movies with you would have been nice. Not just sitting there.\nI will say however being the trilogy of LOTR that is a bit too much and could be tiring even to someone who wanted to see them.

Because he does the exact same for me. I may not like any of his choices, but I still work with him because it\u2019s his birthday. Just as he does the exact same for mine.

Idk I would not have a good time doing something I didn\u2019t wanna do for THAT long. Those movies are NOT short at all and it\u2019s trilogy on top of that. You kinda seem very self centred . Honestly she maybe shouldn\u2019t have gotten lit by the end of it if you weren\u2019t drinking to but also I don\u2019t blame her at all I like LOTR but not Star Wars fan my bf is and if he seriously asked to sit through those movies I be getting high af (I choose weed as my poison I\u2019m not a drinker) but yeah I would apologize to her even if it was wrong of her to not to at least try to pay attention it doesn\u2019t even matter bc how immaturely you handle it. your 28 you should start learning how to communicate now  or forever hold your peace", "YTA OP. She gave you her company on your birthday. She could have easily said no, but she was willing to be there with you while you watched them. If you wanted an active participant, you should have asked someone else that actually likes the movies or compromised with something you both would pay active attention to.", "ESH\n\nI get why you're miffed because of variables of it being your birthday and that she did agree to watch the movie with you. She likely could have tried harder like being a bit more conscious of putting the phone down and pay attention for a few minutes or be affectionate etc. That said, I do agree with everyone else that you set the expectation for someone sit through three movies back to back is a bit hard.\n\nI also very much liked LOTR series, read the books, watched all the movies, and played the MMO for years. However, as much as I enjoyed them those tasks took me weeks to complete. I'm very much someone that doesn't watch movies because I really struggle to sit still and focus. That's me enjoying the series!\n\nJust imagine you had to sit through something you just don't see the appeal of for however long those movies are. You're bored and you're trying.\n\nSimply said, my opinion is you've chosen something that is far too restrictive and you were fully aware she wouldn't enjoy it. She did it with no complaints.", "I mean sure YTA because of what everyone else said, but really who doesn't like the LOTR movies?!!? She's also TA", "YTA.

She agreed to watch them with you. She sat with you. Those movies are very long, so I\u2019m sure she was bored out of her mind. Being on her phone wasn\u2019t hurting anything. She was still spending time with you, when she could have chosen to skip the movies altogether. Be grateful she was willing to hang out with you while they were on.

She never actually agreed to watch them herself or to engage with them. Honestly, you sound pretty self-centred. \n\nTake it from someone who\u2019s been in a happy relationship for 18 years- if you want your partner\u2019s company on your birthday (or any day tbh) you need to compromise a little with what you choose to do and ensure it\u2019s something you\u2019ll both enjoy or can at least tolerate. My husband and I also have quite different tastes in films, so any film that one likes that the other really doesn\u2019t we watch alone, and that\u2019s okay. We also pick things to do for birthdays that the other party can tolerate, or at least won\u2019t take up an entire day if it\u2019s something they dislike.

I am saying this because I want you to know that I actually know what it's like to love this series. The movies are very long and watching them all in one go is really exhausting even for the best of fans...I can't even imagine what it will be like for someone to not be enjoying 9+ hours of the series.\n\nYTA.

Yeah, it's your birthday, but that's way too much LOTR for most people. On the other hand, she should have just said no to your request if she didn't want to do it.

WHY would any ordinary woman be thri\u013aled to watch 11 hours of that. I am a huge fantasy fan, but this high fantasy genre is not for everybody. \n\nWould you do the same for her? Would you watch 11 hours of her favourite show or movie with her and not even touching your phone?", "Absolutely YTA! There is no way in hell I would have sat through one of LOTR if I were her; especially having seen the trilogy previously. It was a total dick move of you to have her watch a long trilogy that you knew full well she didn\u2019t like and you have the audacity to whine because she stayed with you, but checked out of the movies!

Any other day I\u2019d play on my phone or read or tell him to find someone else but birthday is your day. So idk as long as on her birthday you ask if she wants to plan it or wants you to plan it and do it whole heartedly you\u2019re NTA.

The reason for this is, I love my partner. Not everyone shows love in the same way though.\n\nI can see why you feel let down OP.

I can quote the entire extended edition, including the Elvish and whatnot, I can quote all 3 cast commentaries word for damn word.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve never watched them with my husband. I\u2019ve never tried. Because he saw the theatrical edition of Fellowship and was bored shitless. It\u2019s a lost cause.\n\nIf you want a LotR day, have it with someone who actually enjoys the movies, or do it by your damn self.\n\nAnd, BTW, I can name one thing in the last decade I have been able to watch without also having to distract myself in some way (ADHD brain). GoT The Long Night. That episode, while the battle strategy was probably the worst one I think I have ever seen in entertainment media, the episode was intense AF.\n\nBeing on your phone doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t paying attention, as a general rule.

You need to understand that as well. Your girlfriend was very gracious to let you watch them at her house & be there with you. With that said, she has no obligation to pay attention to them- especially if she has already seen them and/or has no interest in them. Your girlfriend tried to accommodate your birthday wishes.

I think more effort to be engaged on her part would be appreciated especially because it\u2019s for you birthday.

It's just wayyyyyy too much. One a day, over a few days? Sure. One a weekend? Even better. \n\nMaking someone sit in front of the TV for several hours to look at something they don't even like and then expect them to not do anything else is torture the likes of the aversion scene in Clockwork Orange.

My dad really liked the humour and action in Firefly even though he normally refuses to watch \"weird\" shows, my friend loved Much Ado About Nothing even though she didn't think she'd be able to follow Shakespearean English, etc). I also would have bailed out and suggested watching/doing something else if I thought they looked bored, or enjoyed the damn movie if they were happy but not entirely tuned in.\n\nI would think was poor behaviour in an 8 year old, let alone a 28 year old.

They're a very consistent vibe.\n\nYou've texted her, but have you apologized? I don't know that I'd ever give you another chance in her place but in case she does, you should sit down and really spend some time thinking about the energy you expend to make her feel comfortable vs what you expect her to do to make you feel comfortable.

My husband would never be able to watch them all back to back. THEY ARE BLOODY LONG!

Watched one as a kid and i kept falling asleep, watched one with him as a teen when we dated... i also fell asleep he just ended up laughing about it i apologized i was honestly just tired tht day and we moved on. \n\nSo when he wanted to share them with me  again because my grown ass has never seen star wars  properly even tho i know about it true pop culture shit we made it a sunday night movie thing. \n\nWe watched them in the order they are supposed to be watched instead of the release order. And I'm actually enjoying watching them. Because i can pay attention to it. Finished revenge of the Sith last week and I'm actually getting into them.\n\nNow he didn't get star trek and i didn't really like harry Potter yes my husband and i are very nerdy people lol we both tried to get the other to watch those and he found star trek weird especially because it was sooo old and the effects were hilarious bt i grew up with it so to me it was nostalgic and by the second harry potter movie i just thought everyone was stupid \ud83d\ude04 no hate please.  We just ended up laughing about it.\n\nPoint is. U cant force someone into liking something.u can introduce them to it. Bt id they arent into it they arent into it.

I'm like that too, I like to talk about what I'm watching with the person I'm watching with, it makes it more of a bonding experience and I genuinely get more out of the movie than when I'm sitting in silence.

I'd fucking expect it.", "Well, yes, that is a fair point. Though I think the issue is, if you invited a friend who didn\u2019t like pizza to a pizza restaurant, they would probably tell you that they don\u2019t like pizza and you would consider other options.\n\nWhilst OP did know his girlfriend doesn\u2019t like LOTR, she still accepted when he said that\u2019s what he wanted to do. She could have told him that watching films she had no interest in for 9hrs would be unbearable for her, maybe suggested they just watch one and propose other activities throughout the day, or as you suggested other activities on other days they could do, but from the way OP has said it, it sounds like this was pretty much all they were doing to celebrate. I think it\u2019s unreasonable that his girlfriend immediately made no effort to show an interest in an activity he suggested and she agreed to, after making no effort to suggest something that would be more enjoyable for her too.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think watching films is a great celebration, because staring at a screen for a couple hours isn\u2019t really something that screams \u201chappy birthday to me!\u201d, but everyone has their own different enjoyments and ways they\u2019ll like to celebrate, and I don\u2019t think OP is at all unreasonable for wanting the people he celebrates with to atleast TRY and engage with the activity that they agreed to do to celebrate HIS birthday", "I\u2019m really unsure how anyone watches all three of those movies without getting drunk (or high) and falling asleep. \n\nSorry man, YTA.", "This is the way.", "Extended editions or nothing.

He'd be drinking the whole time, frowning, and be upset too. OP thinks he's completely justified. I feel for his SO tho, she tried.", "Wow. Clearly me and my friend would do anything for eachother. My friend sat through all five twilight movies because I love them. I put up with watching Star Wars movies because my friend love them.

I understand that after a while you\u2019re likely to get fed up in her situation, but she couldn\u2019t even hold out for *ten minutes*?\n\nI agree completely that he shouldn\u2019t have left without telling her, though I don\u2019t blame him for being upset or wanting to go home. Neither of them seem to be good at communicating how they feel.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought watching movies is a pretty odd way to celebrate things because, well, you just sit and stare at a screen and there\u2019s more interesting and exciting celebrations, but at the end of the day, if you\u2019re celebrating someone else\u2019s birthday, and their number 1 choice of activity to celebrate is to watch a movie, and you agree to do it without even trying to suggest something less boring for you or anyone else that would be coming, you kind of lose your right to complain about how boring it is. She had already watched the movies and knew she didn\u2019t like them, she also knew they were as long as they are, and still agreed to watch them, I don\u2019t know why people think that\u2019s OP\u2019s fault", "Eh.

I don't get going that long without talking about it and saying either we over or let's try to move on.", "I mean, I'm sure there is a series in her movie preference that could be 9 hours long.", "But iTs HiS BiRtHDaY! /s \nYTA OP.", "Probably", "No. I have them but I knew she wouldn't want to sit through those.", "See, that makes more sense. \"What's good for the goose is good for the gander.\" She's not OWED the 6 hours of rapt attention, but if he wants it, he should prove it first.", "For the record I think their both assholes.", "I just think if you actually care about someone on their birthday you would just put up with it. I\u2019ve done it for friends they\u2019ve do. It for me. That\u2019s what you do when you actually care for someone", "Dude, why did you not watch the movies on a different day with a friend who enjoys them and instead go out to dinner or something with your gf? Do something you both enjoy?", "Ok, so imagine sitting through a 9-12 hour lecture on a topic you don't enjoy. A lecture you've already sat through before, and you *know* it wasn't enjoyable, interesting, educational, or anything else to you. \n\nBecause that's the kind of torture you're demanding she sits through.", "I\u2019m a huge horror fan and even I won\u2019t sit through that Serbian movie. Friend, I say this gently as a fellow nerd: your discomfort doesn\u2019t matter more than hers does. Her films make you miserable, yours clearly have the capacity to make her miserable. Instead of arguing with us over whose feelings matter more (they don\u2019t, your feelings matter equally, ESH), take some valuable lessons moving forward. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth either of your time to sit and stew. It\u2019s ok to do separate activities together. Next time you want her to watch something with you and stay off her phone set a reasonable time frame. Break it up, take a walk, talk, do things you both enjoy together. Your birthday sucked for you both, neither of you wants that to happen again. \n\nBut please please **please** stop saying your feelings matter more than hers \ud83d\udda4", "But she really likes those movies and the least you could do is at try to seem like your at least paying attention and watch them with her once in awhile. I mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve even seen them all, just the parts before you asked her to turn them off.", "I agree with you on that\nWhere we disagree is that you seem to think she should have to put up with it in a very specific way - like she can\u2019t drink for some reason\u2026\nThis whole sub is to gauge different opinions so it\u2019s fine to disagree.\nI think he\u2019s the AH and you think ESH. That\u2019s ok.\nI\u2019m just grateful my partner and I would each make sure that whatever we chose to for for our respective birthdays would be fun for us both. I wouldn\u2019t enjoy my bday knowing he was bored like this!", "Yeah I agree. I think they both have the right to be upset"]}
