My girlfriend (F25) had asked what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to watch my favorite movie trilogy, LOTR. I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing. \n\nBut I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all. \n\nThe third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home. \n\nA few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up.

Honestly, how did you think it was going to go? Like if she isn\u2019t interested in the movies, was she really going to spend 9 hours of focused watching? It seems like she was a pretty good sport all things considered.", "All 3 of them? Clocking in at a runtime of over 9 hours? YTA", "YTA\n\nYou knew she didn't like the movies. You asked her to watch them with you, and she sat on a couch next to you while you enjoyed your favorite movies. You can't get mad at someone for being uninterested in something. \n\nMy husband sat through all the Harry Potter movies. He's not a fan. He just hung out with me while I geeked out, and I appreciated it. She spent your birthday with you, doing what you wanted to do.  Sounds like she made an effort to make you happy imo. \n\nHappy late birthday", "YTA. I want you to just think for a minute a movie that you watched  that you REALLY did not enjoy. Now, imagine that your girlfriend asked you to watch that really long (what's it like 7-8 hours) movie for her birthday. If you can honestly tell me that you wouldn't fidget, fall asleep, get on your phone or zone out to think of something/anything else during that movie, then you're the most patient person on the planet and I commend you, sir. \n\nBut the fact is that you picked an activity you knew your girlfriend would not enjoy and then wanted her to sit, raptly entranced by the wonder that is LOTR for a really long time. She was sitting with you. She was doing quiet activities. She wasn't making fun of the movie or saying how stupid it was (that would have made her the AH). She wanted to spend time with you even though the activity you picked wasn't something she enjoyed.\n\n I absolutely loath sports on the tv, but I sit with my partner while he watches it and crochet or read while it's going on. It doesn't mean I don't like him. In fact, it means I really like him that I want to be near him enough to put up with football. Try to see it that way. Your girlfriend likes you enough that she'll sit by you while you watch something she doesn't like.", "YTA. Over 11 hours?! You expected her to suck up half a day actively watching a trilogy you knew she didn\u2019t like? For the sake of your birthday? That\u2019s insanity. If it was ONE of the movies, I could see you being upset, but holy moly, all three?! Did you two discuss expectations before agreeing to this? Did you tell her you expected her undivided attention for 11 hours so she could gracefully nope out or offer a compromise? \n\nYou went over to her place because you like her couch, which she was cool with, for the entirety of your LOTR marathon. You knew full darned well she wasn\u2019t keen on the trilogy, but somehow you still expected her undivided attention? She was bored out of her skull, but was quiet about it. She didn\u2019t tap out and ask you to leave. YOU were the one annoyed with HER, while camped out on HER couch. She was keeping herself occupied on her phone while you watched your favorite movies. The woman is a saint. \n\nBut you, the birthday boy, got all bent out of shape because she messed around in her phone and drank two bottles of whine, er, wine, to cope with/accommodate your 11 hour marathon. She fell asleep and you immaturely left without saying a word. The goal should have been to spend time hanging out together for your birthday, which, honestly, was accomplished. You could have very well watched all of that in your own, on your own time in the comfort of your own home. You cannot monopolize half of someone\u2019s day when they feel obligated for the sake of it being your birthday, and then dictate how they cope with boredom. That is torture.", "YTA. Your favorite movies are your favorites, not hers, and you even acknowledged that she doesn't like them. Now you're pouting because she didn't enjoy being subjected to watching hours of those films? Would you have been attentive and enthralled if she lined up a day of watching Beaches, Fried Green Tomatoes, Sleepless in Seattle, etc.?", "YTA I get that it's your birthday, and you can do what you want. But you knew she had seen the movies and she didn't really care for them. The fact that she was even willing to sit there with foe you for approximately 9 hours is a testament to her patience. Getting mad because she wasn't paying attention is dramatic. If you wanted to spend actual time with her, maybe you should have picked a different activity. Flip it around. How would you feel if you had to sit through 9 hours of movies you don't like?", "YTA. I thought the point was spending all day and part of the night being in her company. No, you want her to watch a few movies she's already seen in a genre she couldn't care less for? Come on man. She cared enough for you to try, then quietly sat there next to you. Try calling her again.", "YTA\n\nShe's seen them before and she didn't like them, yet she agreed to be there with you while you watch them on your birthday without complaint. Why does it matter if she's paying attention? What do you gain from that except the validation of forcing someone to pay attention to something you like for however long that bloody trilogy is? I mean, that is *not* a small amount of time she dedicated to being there with you despite you both knowing she would get nothing from it. You are kinda ungrateful and controlling.\n\nNot to mention the way you just let yourself get angrier and angrier about it until you stormed out without saying anything. She's right. You could stand to grow up.", "YTA. Listen, I love LOTR. We dedicated a whole cozy day to watch the EXTENDED EDITIONS. But my husband and I both enjoy it. \n\n1. You knew she wasn\u2019t interested \n2. You went to HER place \n3. Its 9+ hours of screen time \n\nI would check out on any Stars Wars, Stars Trek, or  horror related movies and my husband knows this\u2026 so he doesn\u2019t obligate or get his feelings hurt when I scroll. \n\nAnd she\u2019s right, you\u2019re too damn old to act this way.", "YTA. You know she doesn\u2019t like them already, and yet you want her to sit through 9 hours of them? Smh. Honestly the fact that she was able to him out until the third movie is impressive. You do need to grow up, you\u2019re lucky she even agreed without complaint. 9 hours is a looong time even for a franchise you like. \n\nAlso off topic but hot take: I feel like movies are  not a great way to spend time with someone, proper movie etiquette usually means you stare at a screen and not talk\u2026", "YTA \n\nYou not only asked her to watch 9 hours straight of movies she doesn't like, you wanted her to be excited about it. She probably tried at first but it was just too much for her. \n\nThink about being asked to watch and pay attention for that long during a movie marathon of something you dislike. How about 9 commercial free hours of golf and you have to look at the TV without looking away?\n\nIt was too much to expect. And you got pissed.", "YTA\n\nI only say this because you chose to watch an extremely long trilogy\u2026\n\nI\u2019m betting your gf is like me and assumed her presence was enough, regardless of whether or not she was actively watching LOTR with you\n\nI mean, you truly expected her to sit there and stare at a screen displaying something she doesn\u2019t enjoy for roughly **11 hours**?", "If I had a boyfriend that wanted to watch these movies for his birthday, I\u2019d probably do it. But sir\u2026.I\u2019m 48. I like to sit.", "YTA that\u2019s several hours of movies she doesn\u2019t like. That has to be agonizing. And I like lotr.", "YTA birthday boy  it is like 10 hours of movies.  More if you pause for bathroom breaks and food.  She stayed with you to watch them.  You know she did not like them.  Do you think having rewatch them again will make her like them. She was board and played on her phone and had some wine.  Be happy she and you were alone.", "You went to her house, sat on her couch, \n spent hours and hours watching what you wanted.  From your telling, she never protested or complained, she completely accommodated you.  Especially if she doesn\u2019t even like these movies, she sounds like a class act.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been in this relationship, but there isn\u2019t a point where you get to control her eyeballs.  Adjust your expectations and save the indignation for something real.\n\nYTA", "Sorry man, YTA. You can't expect someone who doesn't like Lord of the Rings to freaking marathon all 3 movies. You best brush off your best apology and bring her a bottle of wine. She drank all of hers, apparently lol", "YTA you wanted her company while you watched your favorite movies, knowing she doesn't enjoy them. Yet she gave you the time and company. I am on her side.", "YTA. Also a child at 28 years old! Use your words and communicate instead of throwing a tantrum like a child. \n\nYou knew she didn\u2019t like the movies yet obligated her to watch it with you. You didn\u2019t take her disinterest as a hint at the first movie and went in to watch all 3 movies!! Grow up", "Soft YTA. Plenty of people multitask through movies and TV shows, especially ones they've already seen or that can be slow like LotR. And if she'd paid full attention, what would you have gotten out of it? Another meh if you asked if she liked it better this time? Did you expect a heady discussion of movies she's not that interested in?\n\nBut the biggest AH moves were not saying anything about being miffed and, biggest of all, leaving without saying anything. Communication is key. Though I will say that her calling you an AH is unproductive.", "YTA. My ex husband was like this. No matter what he was watching (any time, not birthdays) he wanted me to sit there and stare at the screen, laugh at appropriate times, smile when he glanced at me. Ugh.", "YTA.  If it was just one movie, I might have thought she was rude.  But she knew she had an entire day ahead of her of dull movie watching. I am surprised she didn\u2019t start drinking until the 2nd movie. \n\nIt is one thing to get special treatment on your birthday.  It is another thing entirely to expect someone to waste 7+ hours watching movies you already know they dislike.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you watch them on your own?  What did forcing her to be there do for you but gratify your ego?  Grow up.", "Omg. My husband could have totally written this about me. I\u2019m happy to sit in the room with him and snuggle up together while he watches and I read my book, but I could not possibly care less about those movies. (I also like my wine.) \n\nIf he asked me to watch ONE, I\u2019d suffer through it. But a movie marathon of a series you KNOW she dislikes? Is your birthday wish for her to just suffer in front of you for a whole day?\n\nNot voting as I\u2019m curious now to see if I\u2019m TA in my own marriage! \ud83d\ude02", "YTA don\u2019t you know the ongoing joke is that girls will ask their partners to watch movies with them and then fall asleep except for you and vice versa you asked her and she fell asleep. Most people just laugh this off and make a joke about it you are taking this to the whole new level. I fall asleep all the time watching shows, you wanted to have a relaxing movie night that\u2019s exactly what she did. She did. What was a relaxing movie night for her popped a few bottles of wine kick back and relax and happen to fall asleep. You got your panties all up in a bunch I think you need to apologize to her.", "YTA - expecting someone to watch nearly 12 hours of a movie series she doesn't really like? And she stayed and all she did was fall asleep in hour... 8? \n\njfc man have a heart!", "I might\u2019ve been on your side in a normal circumstance, but ELEVEN HOURS STRAIGHT is an unhinged expectation to have of someone outside the lotr nerdom. (Especially considering she\u2019s SEEN them already!) If it was about spending quality time together, you would have chosen something you both could enjoy. Sure, it\u2019s your birthday and you can choose to watch whatever you want\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t natural consequences to your dumb choice.\nEdited to add: YTA", "YTA. She did her best and those are very long movies I imagine even longer to those to dislike them. You coulda just been grateful.", "YTA. This is not an activity you ask of someone who isn't an excited participant.", "YTA. \n\n28 years old. Honestly hard to fathom how you could be this clueless at that point in your life.", "YTA\n\nYou graduated magna cum laude from the acade-me-me-ME!, didn't you? You knew she doesn't really care about the movies but wanted to watch at her place because of the big screen. She sat by you despite not caring about it (and I get it bc meh) and scrolled through her phone to pass the time. If you wanted to share this with people sharing your enthusiasm you should have just done that, maybe your gf would have even given you permission to use her location and it could have been special. Your gf doesn't have to fake in interest in somethnig you KNOW she's not interested in", "This is either ESH or NAH but I'm kinda tending towards ESH because why dont you talk to each other about your relationship?", "ESH. It\u2019s not very thoughtful of her to ask what you wanted to do for your birthday and then immediately disregard that you wanted to do this together.\n\nIt\u2019s also dumb that you sat there and stewed about it for 7 hours rather than just say something.", "Honestly, if my partner was completely uninterested in my favorite anything, I'd be happy that they agreed to even sit through them with me, even if they stayed on their phone the whole time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe gift is her company, but what did you expect? That she would genuinely love them for the day? What's the big deal about being on her phone? For that, you get a You The You-know, BUTTTTT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe drank herself into a blackout in a few hours? On the couch? Is that unusual behavior for her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, ESH but not for the reason you asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think that you two sound compatible, from the perspective you've just written?", "I'm... going to go with ESH.  I absolutely get wanting someone to be engaged with your favorite stories, I do.  If we were talking about one movie, I would say this is on her - Asking somoene to be focused on a movie as a birthday present is not that huge a deal and she could have declined.  You probably however, should have read the room and noticed \"hey, she's REALLY not engaged or interested, maybe pushing through 9 hours of a thing she clearly doesn't like is not the way to go\"", "ESH. I would have been bored to tears. She shouldn't have agreed to that, but you KNEW she finds those movies blech and expected her to watch those long ass movies anyway.", "ESH. Don't get me wrong, my husband and I love LoTR, but those are loooooong movies and to watch all 3 back to back, especially for someone not into it, that's a huge commitment.  She could've tried harder but you could be more understanding.", "I'm gonna go with NAH. You wanted to watch LoTR. She didn't. She did what she could to make it enjoyable for both of you without being negative. It could've been salvaged with grace and communication and luckily for y'all it seems like it still can. For a bigger problem I might say ESH but this time for such a little issue it's a firm NAH", "ESH. She didn't engage with you on your birthday and you threw a tantrum.", "No, you're NTA. I don't get all the YTA votes, because she asked what you wanted to do. Asked and answered, and AGREED to. Not the asshole. (Although those movies suck, my guy.)", "So.. I can kinda get why you were annoyed... But you knew those weren't her fave... So why not make it a whole experience to make it a bit enjoyable for both of you all. \n\nI say this as someone who is currently planning an at home movie day for my own husband on his birthday next but instead of just sitting on the couch like usually... I'm building a pillow bed on the floor... Providing movie theme snacks and such.. But in general just trying to make it more if a true movie experience... \n\n\n.... I'm saying next time... Even though she hates the movie... Maybe you both could think of ways to jazz it up a bit so she won't be completely bored... And you can engage her throughout the experience so both of you can be somewhat happy.", "ESH. Suggesting the whole trilogy when you know she doesn\u2019t care for the movies is a little ridiculous. At the same time, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to watch them all with you if she didn\u2019t want to. I feel like this all could\u2019ve been avoided if y\u2019all just communicated better.", "You're both at fault here. You, for asking her to throw away her whole day on movies you already know she doesn't like. Her, for agreeing and then not sticking with her agreement. Your girlfriend is not your conjoined twin. You could have asked someone else to watch the movies with you--someone who would enjoy doing that--and then got together with your girlfriend for dinner, for instance. And when you asked her, she could have politely declined to watch the movies. Which would have been a much better way to handle it than hanging on her phone and getting drunk.", "NTA \n\nIt was YOUR birthday. YOUR birthday. She asked what you wanted to do. You said you wanted to do this one thing. \n\nShe was rude. \n\nIt's not hard to sit through a movie or series you don't really care for, when the other person is someone you care for . \n\nI would really reconsider this relationship.  Not because she's not into LOTR, but because of how horrible she acted during it. Fuck, she could have at least said no and let you watch them on your own, then done something special with you.", "NTAH. I don't like those movies either. (huge respect  to Peter Jackson)  It was your birthday!  You can't expect her to like them but she could let you watch without being upset. \n\nI'd just be happy you wanted to share your birthday with me and I'd hope my girlfriend would be too. \n\nBe well!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you opt for the extended editions (11+ hours)?\n\nI love LotR, and you, my dude, are giving us LotR nerds a bad reputation.", "YTA. Sorry, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s your birthday, 9+ hours of movies you know she doesn\u2019t like, and expecting her undivided attention is ridiculous and unfair.", "Imagine if you asked your partner how they would like to spend their birthday together and they choose 9+ hours of staring at a screen. \n\nYta, do you even want to have a girlfriend? Maybe you'd be better off not having to waste time talking to her", "YTA. You asked her to spend HOURS- and entire day- watching movies you know she wouldn\u2019t enjoy.

As it happens, I just watched the entire LOTR extended edition trilogy (all 12 hours of it) last Saturday with my sister and some friends. I'm a big LOTR fan, but that is a HUGE time commitment even if you enjoy them. Most of the friends we were watching with were in and out, and didn't stay for the whole marathon because they had other commitments. (And yes, though I stayed for the whole thing, I was on my phone/ laptop for some of the time!)\n\nIt was incredibly kind of your girlfriend to keep you company for so long while you were watching movies that you enjoy and that she doesn't. Asking her to be riveted to them for that long is a bridge too far. Next time why don't you find something to do with her that you both enjoy, and save your obsessions that she doesn't share for your own time and couch?", "You made this woman watch 11 hours of movies that you know she didn't like and got mad that she wasn't into it?

Asking her to watch ONE of them with you would have been understandable but the entire trilogy? Dude, come on. No one wants to sit through 9+ hours of a movie they don't enjoy.

This wasn't a couple hours at a party where she doesn't know anyone.\n\nThat being said, if she was going to agree to watch, she should have tried harder to be polite. Only lasting 10 minutes before forgoing manners is a little ridiculous for an adult.

And since she doesn't drink much I feel like her just sitting there and drinking two bottles of wine was basically just her acting like I was torturing her.", "I'd imagine that the OP would want to watch the extended editions, which run to 11h55m according to google.", "Closer to 12 if he\u2019s a true fan. Extended editions add some time.", "well put!", "Looks like OP's birthday wish for quality time with his girlfriend turned into a Fellowship of the Whine.", "She doesn't really like those types of movies, but I guess your right. I would probably struggle through a whole day of her favorite movies too.", "I guess I wouldn't like it. I just never sit there on my phone if she is watching one of her movies. I've had to ask her to turn some of them off and she'll just finish watching them later though.", "I have difficulty sitting through a movie at home I really want to watch without something in my hand. I literally took up cross-stitch again because kept having to rewind the film as I was also scrolling on my phone too much. Some of us need something else to do while we watch tv.", "She normally doesn't mind that. She will watch movies for a whole day and sometimes I join her.", "THE QUEEN OF COMMENTING HAS ARRIVED!!!!!!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "9 hours and 18 minutes if they aren\u2019t doing the extended cuts. And I love LOTR, but we always do our family watch-alongs on a long weekend and do one a day. Even I would need to do something else about 4 hours in!", "My husband and I watch the extended editions of LOTR around midwinter every year but even we have never tried to watch them all in one go. That poor girl \ud83d\ude2d", "I love LOTR and I wouldn't want to watch all three movies at once, his gf doesn't even like them so it had to be absolute agony for her.", "You're being too generous with OP, there are a ton of red flags I'm seeing in OP's post and his comments that tell me this movie thing is just the tip of an iceberg of selfishness and immaturity.", "Wife and I are opposite. She snuggles up to me and watches TV while I one handed try to hold a book and flip pages. After a few (many) attempts to divert my attention she figured out I don't give a rats behind who is the best dancer or behind the mask lol", "She hasn't seen all of them. She watched the first one and like three quarters of the second one.", "That's true. I guess I thought she was being quiet rather than complaining about it so I thought she was actually trying until she just got drunk and fell asleep.", "The drinking is pretty unusual. She only really drinks on special occasions and very, very rarely in between. \nI feel like we are compatible, we just have very different hobbies.", "You're right. She sometimes will spend a whole day watching movies so I didn't think one day would be a big deal but I guess it was.", "This is a good idea but I was the one who first showed them to her and I tried to make a big thing out of it. The only difference is she got stoned instead.", "Ha. No I didn't ask her to watch the extended versions.", "You were \ud83d\ude02", "Would you watch 9 hours straight of something you didn't like, for her?", "What would you call what you did to her?  Love and respect?  You are a self-righteous immature AH", "You literally were tho! How can you not see that? Lol", "OMG", "Bored of the Rings", "Well guess what buddy, you now owe her at least six hours of that and you better not be on your phone after this tantrum", "You didn't mention in your post any reason why you would be annoyed at her for not paying attention. Was there a reason?", "ya think", "You ask her to turn off her own movies when you're bored? Dude. Learn how to parallel play. You can enjoy being in the same room with your partner without doing the same activities. She clearly knows how to do it already.", "So you are saying she should have told you on your birthday to stop watching your movie?", "Yeah but they\u2019re probably movies she chose, and likes.", "Yeah\u2026 that\u2019s too much for someone that doesn\u2019t really like them and that\u2019s just having them sit there. OP expected her to actually watch them.", "So?", "11 hours is still alot, my G  \n\n\nshe'd probably get more out of it if you split it into 3 sections.  \n\n\nThen it's 3 nights of a meal and cuddling while watching movies, instead of a literal 11 hour slog through something she's frankly not interested in.  \n\n\nyou want her to appreciate the last 2 movies?  \n\n\nwell them my dude... dont burn her out halfway thru the second so she's completely checked out at the third.  \n\n\nsplit it up, and she'll be more engaged with each", "So were you actually that upset by her being on her phone?", "The difference is almost certainly what the movies are - If you asked me to sit down and binge watch my favorite movies, I'd be way more engaged than I would if you asked me to watch a Hallmark movie marathon.  Also, I've observed that some people 'watch' tv and movies, and then are basically messing around on their phone or whatever and not paying attention.  This is something that drives me nuts about my ex-wife - Even in a show or movie she is interested in, she will be knitting or playing on her phone or switch teh whole time and regularly misses plot points because of it.", "Fair enough... Hopefully y'all can work it out. I think both of you all could have done some compromising. \n\n\nI love LOTR and even I have trouble sitting through a marathon of them at times. So you gotta adjust your expectations a bit.... And she could have least paid attention a bit more.\n\nEither way good luck.", "I feel like because of the types of movies she likes it's different. I've tried watching some of her movies before and some I can sit through and some I can't.", "I don't know. I guess I just really love these movies and I thought she would at least act interested. She hasn't even seen all of them and just lumps them all together and says she doesn't like them. I've put effort into watching her movies before even though sometimes I can't sit through them, but when I came over last weekend I could tell she was already kind of stoned like she was just expecting it to be awful.", "Not because I'm bored. She watches really violent and graphic horror movies and they've given me nightmares before.", "Nah, he says in comments he \u201ccan\u2019t sit through\u201d a lot of her movies and probably wouldn\u2019t be able to stay engaged if she asked him to watch 9 hours of just her favorites.", "If OP had any empathy at all the correct response would be to either \n\n1. Not suggest an activity you know she doesn't like to begin with\n2. Or notice she's not into it so you turn the movies off and suggest something else\n\nOP is acting like just because it's his birthday he doesn't have to be considerate to his partner. There is no alternate dimension that exists where I'd do this to someone I supposedly love lmao", "No I guess I was just upset that she didn't even try to seem like she was paying attention.", "I've been trying to get ahold of her all this week and she's been ignoring me. So I don't know.", "My friend, it is no different. You feel about her movies, the way she feels about yours. And that's ok.", "And she can\u2019t sit through 9-11 hours of LotR without downing 2 full bottles of wine.", "Hey AH then why do you expect her to do it?", "[deleted]", "You are mad she can\u2019t sit through 9-12 hours when you can\u2019t sit through 2 hours for her??", "Then YOU leave the room. \n\nWait, is she watching those movies at *her* house on *her* tv, and you tell her to turn them off?!? Damn, she's way nicer to you than you are to her.", "\u2026.no comment. He\u2019s really 28?", "She watches really, really graphic and violent horror movies all the time. I can't do scary movies...", "But she doesn't like them. Why would you get any enjoyment out of her focusing her attention on something she doesn't like? \n\nI'd get it if she had never seen them and you were hopeful she could enjoy them with you, but that wasn't the case here. Is your favorite movie really enhanced by nine hours of boring the shit out of your partner?", "Why should she pay attention, though? She was there, as you asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou didn't *ask* her to enjoy them. Again - did you think that she should **enjoy** them for you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can't answer that - answer this:  \n\n\nHave you ever spent an entire day doing something that she loves, even though it bores you to death?", "Then ask yourself... Do you really want to be in a relationship with someone who uses the silent treatment and not communication? \n\nA week of silent treatment is not a good look. \n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's just different. I don't like her movies because they scare me.", "She watches incredibly violent and scary movies and they freak me out.", "I can't watch graphic movies. As I've gotten older, grpahic violence just makes me anxious. My partner would never aak me to watch nine hours of them. Now flip that. Why is your \"I can't do x type of movie\" any more or less valid than hers? And from your other comments you've asked her to turn them off. She didn't do that with you, sje sat theough what, seven hours of really slow paced fantasy movie before she fell asleep?", "So the world should revolve around you and only you?  She is right you need to grow up.", "And she doesn't like your movies because they bore her.\n\nJust like you don't enjoy being scared as entertainment, she doesn't enjoy being bored. The only difference is her movies are 2 hours and yours were 9.", "Haha", "lmao", "It really isn't though", "I guess I just feel like there is a difference between being bored and being scared.", "Both are discomfort. The thing I'd ask yourself is why you wanted to do something you *knew* she didn't enjoy. My fiance and I have very different tastes in things, but we'd never make the other person sit through something they'd dislike just for our benefit, never mind for 9+ hours straight. Add on top of that you expected her to oay attention and it becomes unfathomable."]}
