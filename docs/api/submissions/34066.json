If that was an undercover agent you would have gotten your store into A LOT of trouble.\n\n3.  Do you REALLY need total strangers to tell you how wrong you are?  Are you really lacking that much introspection or self awareness?!", "YTA. My SO started going grey since he was 23 (like he had legit grey hairs that were clearly visible), and in middle school I had a teacher who said she started going grey since she was in her teens.

You literally never need to comment on someone's body (including their hair).\nIt's unprofessional and,  in this instance,  unkind. \n\nGray hair is also not legal proof of age, so you were putting your employer (and possibly yourself) at risk for HUGE penalties.", "YTA. Seems like it should be common sense not to comment on customers\u2019 appearances\u2014especially things that can be perceived negatively.", "I started going grey at 18. One, YTA for assuming. Two, YTA for being shit at your job. You know you\u2019re supposed to card everyone, dude.", "If the are wrinkles, your comment is fair. We\u2019re old. No wrinkles, you deserve that response", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an AH over it but this is a good way to get yourself fired for selling alcohol to someone underage. Gray hair can start very early.", "YTA, my ex (man) has a totally full and awesome head of hair, but started graying at 23. To the point teens would ask what product he used to get it \u201cso cool.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s better in any situation like this to never assume and just do the thing that errs on the side of caution (ask for ID, not assume someone is pregnant, not assume anything about a disability), etc. \n\nCan\u2019t think of any upside to commenting on a customer\u2019s appearance, unless it\u2019s a compliment - like you really like their shirt or manicure or something totally not biological.", "YTA\n\nBasically what you said was \"I don't need to see your ID because you look old\".", "In high school j had a friend who had gray hair. She said it was genetic which given that we were 16 at the time made sense", "Going against the grain but NTA.\n\nAlthough gray hair and beards aren\u2019t a perfect judge of age.  \n\nAfter being told I have a baby face for decades, cashiers have stopped asking for my id.  Oof.  But there are worse thing in the world.", "YTA - you commented negatively on her looks. There many things you could have said, other than that. The smart thing would have been to just take the ID and look at it or at least pretend to.", "YTA. Since she already handed it to you, you should've just checked it w/o making a comment.\n\nWho knows where she is from. Where I live, the local grocery store eventually adopted a policy where everyone has to show ID when buying alcohol, period. So I'm used now to taking out ID, and maybe that's what she did.\n\nAnyway, no need to say anything.", "YTA - especially because you could be wrong. Want to loose your job and find out you face legal penalties because you sold alcohol to a minor.", "YTA", "YTA. How can you be 36 years old and this ignorant?", "Yeah YTA.

The comment was insensitive and unnecessary.\n\nand yes, some people get grey hair very early. Heck, my nephew is 7 and has a streak of grey. My BIL started getting grey hair in high school.", "YTA. Your comment was not necessary and rude. If she had already given you the ID, look at it and give it back. It would have taken you all of 2 seconds.", "YTA. Gray hair is not a legal identification method for that matter, and you would have been fired if that had been a sting lol.", "YTA. Sometimes the things you think don\u2019t need to become the things you say.", "Omg haha. I started going grey when I was 19. You\u2019re obviously the asshole and good for her for telling you off", "Absolutely YTA. Are you dumb lol", "NTA\u2026so you\u2019re statement was accurate", "YTA\n\nDon't insult your customers. It would have taken five seconds to just glance at the ID and say \"sure\".", "YTA... to be fair, my grandmother went grey at 17, lol", "YTA and very rude.", "YTA. I know so many people who went grey at an extremely young age but it\u2019s also just not really a thing you comment on for strangers as it could be a sensitive topic. You could have given the ID a quick glance or just let them know that they\u2019re good, no need to comment on appearances - that\u2019s fairly basic knowledge.", "I started finding grey hairs when I was 29. I have an older cousin who started losing his hair in high school. Making that comment was rude af. Next time, just look at the ID and don't make remarks about someone's appearance. \nYTA", "YTA, but that\u2019s the point of your story.", "Yeah, soft YTA\n\nA little advice from someone that's been around the world a few times and worked retail..... NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER assume someone is over 21 because they have gray hair. I have a cousin who's balding and has had gray hair for over 20 years.... Started getting grays when he was a freshmen in high school. Same goes for a high school friend.... TONS of gray as a senior in high school..... Just because a person has gray hair or is losing their hair doesn't mean they're automatically over 21.\n\nYou don't want to be \"that guy\" that causes your employer to get fined for an under age sale. And you really don't want to be that guy that basically tells someone that's 24 that she looks like she's in her 40's....", "YTA \ud83d\ude44", "I\u2019ve been going grey since my teens. (Genetics).

You make an \\*ass\\* of \\*u\\* and \\*me\\*.\n\nMy best friend from high school was fully grey at 27.  At 61, I only have a few grey hairs.  What does that mean?  Nothing.", "YTA. What's wrong with you. Why would you assume that?\nI've had greys since 19 asshole.", "YTA she was literally making your job easier by just handing you the ID, and you made an extremely rude comment. How could you possibly think that you\u2019re not TA in this situation?", "YTA. Simple.", "Soft YTA, because (A) yes, some people DO start to go gray in their 20s, and (B) it's not necessary for you to say what you did. People can also look much younger than their actual ages; I was being carded into my early 30s! So from now on, just ask for ID, say it's company policy to ask EVERYONE for ID and don't assume that people are of any particular age just because of their appearance.", "\u201cI was deliberately insulting. Am I the asshole?\u201d\n\nYes. Yes you are.", "YTA, just check ID\u2019s before your store loses their liquor license", "YTA", "YTA. Even if she were elderly, that's really rude to point out. Next time someone show their ID, just check the age and nod, like you're supposed to.", "YTA a few people are literally born with gray hair. It's definitely not the indication of age. You're gonna get fired if you don't ID people based on their hair or other things you deem old.", "I too have been going grey since my teens. It\u2019s trauma based. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a jerk, exactly. But for the future, just ask for ID. It saves everyone the embarrassment.\n\nEdit: want to add that people of all ages mostly love being ID\u2019d. Women mostly, I am also a woman but I don\u2019t care lol, but they love being ided. It\u2019s like being accused of being too young. Yes. They will be thrilled to show you they are age appropriate.  Because to them, they still have that youth vitality.", "YTA,\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you know someone is above the legal limit to purchase alcohol.. ID still needs to be checked.. its part of your job..", "I wouldn\u2019t have minded (grey hair is what it is - nothing I\u2019m ashamed of), but others may take offense.  Probably best to avoid making comments about age or weight in general when working with customers.  But feel free to not ID me when you see the grey - I don\u2019t want to dig out my license if I don\u2019t have to since I\u2019m likely just paying with my watch anyway.", "YTA.

It's genetic for many of us. My grandfather was all grey before he was 20, and if I hadn't started dying my hair, it would have been heavily streaked with grey and white in my 20s as well. And ironically, I have a baby face other than that and get mistaken for someone 20 years younger (no, that's not a typo). It's pretty funny. \n\nBut yeah, premature greying happens to a lot of people because of genetics.", "Those aren\u2019t the sign of aging either\u2026 My husband has had wrinkles since he was in high school. Basing someone\u2019s age on wrinkles is just as stupid as basing their age on how much gray they have.", "So it would have been fine if he would have said, you have wrinkles so you must be old.", "I read somewhere that gray hair is a sign of fast growing hair (so that more air is in the hair than before instead of the Color pigment). But yeah, genetics play a very big role with that."]}
