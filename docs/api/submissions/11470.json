My BF have some popularity in my school and the aforementioned girl was one of his admirer, and was upfront about it. I started dating my BF in my senior year and Jen was our biggest \"supporter\" and used to tell me she have a crush on \"us\" (The idea of me and my bf being together). We graduated high school and parted ways\n\n\n\nIn the middle of last year, Jen joined as an intern at BF's workplace and is still so enthusiastic about me and BF, according to my boyfriend she sometimes subtly inquired about our relationship. She have reached out to me as well but I wasn't too keen on being friends with her and mostly keep her at arm's length. \n\n\nI don't know when it started exactly, but when my BF and his coworkers get together(or when Jen have the chance to chat with my BF) Jen started mentioning stuff about disloyalty in a relationship and dropping hints about me being disloyal and not being fully committed to our relationship. She ended up accusing me of cheating on my BF and show him a pic of me and another guy eating out while they we're having lunch with other co-workers. \n\n\n\n\nMy BF knows the guy I went out with and he knows the reason I went out with him, he also knows there's no possibility of me ever cheating on him or disrespecting our relationship. He thanked Jen for looking out for him, but there's nothing to worry about and he'd prefer if Jen could stop obsessing over our relationship. Later that evening he tells me all about how Jen's accusations of me and how he respond and mentioned how he would have been harsher if they weren't in public. He ask me if I'd like to confront Jen because I was the one being slandered. I tell him I don't really care for that but since he's the one being harassed, he can go forward as he like and I'll also ask Jen to stop harassing him. \n\n\n\n\nThe confrontation happened yesterday, my BF wasn't too polite with Jen and even ask for reassignment with all his work relating with Jen, which embarrassed Jen to tears, she complained about me and how she's afraid her career might suffer from it on social media and some people reached out to me and tell me I fucked up and I shouldn't have my BF, who's a man confront Jen, the fairer sex. They say I should be the one doing the confrontation and shouldn't have put another woman at a difficult position. \n\n\n\n\n\nI don't think me and my BF did anything wrong but at the same time I kinda get that for a woman a confrontation with a man might be uncomfortable and even scary. \n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think, does this make me the AH?", "created_utc": 1677940497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i0ll2/aita_for_letting_my_boyfriend_confront_a_coworker/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be so proud of my boyfriend if he handled the situation the same way.", "You are NTA. \nYour BF is Jen\u2019s coworker. It\u2019s on him to handle it. \nYou should not be involved in your boyfriend\u2019s work relationships, even if you are friends. \nIf Jen can lie and manipulate she can take the heat when she\u2019s called out on it. \nYour BF is handling this correctly. Stay out of it. \nBoth of you should block Jen on any social media and avoid her socially moving forward. \nIf your BF had to work with her he should be polite and otherwise don\u2019t engage about anything not directly related with the work at hand. Also I would try to have someone else around whenever they interact at work. \nYour BF may also want to loop his manager/HR in, just in case Jen tries to make trouble for him.", "I can't see where you're at fault in any way here. She was kind of weird about the two of you in high school, and is now his coworker. As his coworker, she's making him uncomfortable and telling lies that make working with her difficult. He is the only person that has any right or responsibility to speak to her and HR, you interfering on his behalf would be foolish and undermine him . NTA, and neither is your boyfriend.

If you had done it, you would have taken blame for that as well.  You should tell anyone who reached out to you that you aren't looking for feedback on the situation - then block them.", "NTA and neither was your BF. As far as females being the fairer sex( WTH) It isn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d to make lies up about people. It isn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d to try to break up relationships. Jen is a jerk. She is unprofessional. She should worry about her career because of her uncalled for behavior. It sounds as if she is using her job to grab other people\u2019s BFs, not to advance on her own.", "NTA Jen brought it up to your boyfriend. She\u2019s his coworker. Why would you be the one to confront her? Sounds like she got her comeuppance. Play stupid games..", "NTA.  All you did was tell your bf to do what he thought best about a troublemaker at his job.", "NTA. He did it in a work setting that you have nothing to do with as his partner.\n\nMaybe these friends need a damn reality check and a reminder that Jen attacked your integrity and loyalty in public in the hope that your bf would dump you. How about no.", "Nta. Lying manipulator is going to lie and manipulate.", "Definitely NTA. Jen made a (bad) decision, and decisions come with consequences. She went in tryin to stir the pot and got burned before it even started boiling.", "NTA. The argument was between two colleagues and should have remained that way.", "NTA \n\nFirst of, you are not responsible for your boyfriends actions. You told him that he get's to handle this the way he wants. And you are not responsible for that. Do I personally think he should have yelled? No, but that's his decision and I personally am a - try the least dramatic way first. But that's still a personal choice and  I can see why he got mad. Still, his actions are not your responsibility. \n\nI do think that him asking to be reassigned was a smart move. She sounds like a manipulative lying bee. She doesn't respect boundaries. She's trying to disrupt your relationship and now she cries for being called out. \n\nThe fact all her friends are coming towards you just shows how manipulative she is. She should have kept out of this. This is on her. \n\nAnd then calling like 'oh you should not have let him do that?' that's some back-sided internalized sexism. If we are equal, then he has every right to confront her. Of course he shouldn't get violent, but he is allowed to defend himself and his relationship.", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
