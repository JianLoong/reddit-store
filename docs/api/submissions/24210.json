SIL was cruel, and NC/LC is a perfectly acceptable consequence for that cruelty.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.  I know it will be a while in coming, but I wish you peace.\n\nAnd in the meantime, protecting yourself from bad actors is not at all AH behavior.  <3", "NTA. You are right. I might have understood her first botched attempt at talking to you, but the perseveration with which she has hunted you down is downright cruel. I'm very happy your husband supports you. Hugs.", "NTA! I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nI had a miscarriage in September, and my brother in law asked hubby - what caused it, what did we do and when will we try again - on the DAY of our loss with hubby crying on the phone.

That was the last time either one of us has spoken to him.\n\n(Nearly a year later and we still get little moments of grief.

Your SIL\u2019s behavior has been abominable and you going NC is justified.", "NTA. You are grieving the loss of a person, one you lost in a way which too much of society doesn't view as such. I am so sorry you are going through this, without the love and empathy of everyone around you. It is really nice to read your husband stand up for you. I'm sure you don't want to feel \"to blame\" for him lowering contact with his family. Remember that is their fault, not yours. You are doing nothing wrong, you are in grief and you are being very mature about it. Missing the baby shower was for sure the right decision - if you thought it was. Trust your gut, don't guilt yourself, and just take the time it takes to process this tragedy. If your in law's can't see that, don't expose yourself to them. You and your husband will get through this together. Therapy might be helpful if that is an option. \n\nBe strong and continue to look after yourself and each other like it seems you are.", "[removed]", "NTA\nI can't imagine what your going through. Your sil seems like she's trying to get at you. She has no respect what so ever and it just ones again shows in these kinda situations that the parents just enable the spoil children. Good that you went low contact.\n\nNot that it makes her in any way right but did she have issues with pregnancy before? Is this her frist child? I'd love to know why she feels so much superior then you cause she got lucky because a lot off people fail to realise that depending on where you live 20% off pregnancies end in midcarriages. And then we haven't even talked about complicated births that end in baby loosing it's live pregnancy is something special but also incredibly had don't ever let someone tell you otherwise.", "What \n\nThe\n\nActual\n\nDuck\n\nGet over *it*???!\nI'm wishing things on your SIL right now that will have me burning in hell for eternity. And I'm good with that.\n\nNTA and so sorry for your loss", "Absolutely NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nMy SIL got pregnant 3 months before I did. She ended up having a miscarriage. Out of respect I immediately stopped talking all things baby around her. She will ask me and then I will answer but I never bring any of it up to her. I know she is excited for us, but I don\u2019t want to be cruel to her. Your SIL is being horrible for continuing to press the situation and make it all about her. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with that on top of a loss", "NTA.  You have a right to grieve in your own way, and if it\u2019s hard to be around your SIL right now, that\u2019s fine.

Let your in laws think your wrong. They\u2019re horrible people you don\u2019t need in your life. I can\u2019t imagine being so heartless. Your hubs did a good thing by going LC with them.

Her PARENTS are ok with her being cruel? Time to cut their asses off too. Fuck all of them.", "NTA -- my sincere condolences on your loss. You deserve time to heal and you have sought that space with far more grace than your feckless SIL deserves. She is harming you. She knows that what she is doing is harming you. She has been told repeatedly that it is harming you. She continues. That is cruelty, plain and simple. You owe her nothing. Your inlaws are wrong. You owe them nothing.  \n\n\nIt will not be your job to justify or explain your choice to cut contact. They may feel entitled to makes those demands, but they are not entitled to a response. People capable of such disregard of another cannot be reached with reason or an appeal to decency. Until they can acknowledge what they did wrong, apologize, and find a way to atone, I'd advise not giving them access to your life ever, especially if children are involved.", "NTA. If someone did that to me, I'd probably [deleted to keep from being banned] the shit out of them. There is no reasonable excuse for rubbing salt into fresh wounds. Anyone telling you to suck it up for any reason should be added to the blocked and NC lists. It's disturbing to me that anyone is supporting her.", "Telling a woman to 'suck it up' after having a miscarriage.  Not a good way to support a family member.

This wasn't my first loss. 2 previous miscarriages and an ectopic. It all took its toll. For my in-laws, they only knew about this one. \n\nSending healing thoughts your way.

This is my SIL's first child. I got engaged before my SIL, but she insisted on marrying 3 months before us. I guess cracks started to show when my husband had to explain that he couldn't contribute more than \u00a35k towards her wedding, as he needed to contribute towards his own. He got a lot of pressure from his brother and parents. her wedding cost a lot of money. Where  as we went for small and intimate and it cost a lot less. My husband spent more on his sisters wedding than ours. But it still wasn't good enough.", "Of course, you wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. She might just have had a moment of rudeness because she was happy about her pregnancy. But the rest, oh, the REST.", "Whoa...\nWait...\nHE contributed to HER wedding?\nWhy? \nYes I'm being nosy\n\nOh and NTA \n\nAT\n\nALL!!!!!", "Wow that sounds like an ikky situation. Sounds like she's definitely the favourite child and has never been told no before. \n\nHonestly i've been watching pregnancy and miscarriage journey off a vlog channel i recently been enjoying and i could just picture the situation in my head so well that I got mad. Being a woman just so complicated \ud83e\udee0", "I think its a cultural thing.", "Jeez...\n\nThat's insane...\n\nI am so sorry that your In-laws are showing their true colors, cultural or not. \n\n\nI wish you and your husband all the love, support and peace in the world!", "Inlaws can think what they want. You are entitled to your own opinion(s). NTA. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. Good luck with healing physically and mentally. My SIL lost a baby and did some research re how to be physically healthy to get pregnant and went on to have two boys. I hope it all works out for you.", "NTA. Had a miscarriage in October and I still have pangs about that April baby. I withdrew from pretty much everything last winter, and that didn't include baby-adjacent stuff. A baby shower would have been an absolute no.\n\nWishing you the best as you start the healing process.", "NTA. Your SIL doesn't understand it even a little. I hope she never has to experience it.  \n\n I'm sorry for your loss. I had a miscarriage 3 weeks ago and I have never felt grief like this before. I hope the people that matter understand and vouch for the fact that this is something you learn to carry the rest of your life, it will take time, and even then, it will never be the same.", "I am so sorry for your loss.

Don't go to any of her events, don't be an aunt to her child. SIL's actions cross the line from AH into being evil.", "NTA. It\u2019s been like 10+ years since my last miscarriage and when I told my sister I was happy for her that she was pregnant but wouldn\u2019t be able to go to her baby shower next month, she told me she understood and to let her know what my limits were. THAT is how a family member should react to you mourning the loss of your pregnancy. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and that you are going through this. Take as long to heal as you need to and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad for that.", "Absolutely NTA. My friend had a loss a couple of months before I found out I was pregnant. I hid the pregnancy from her as long as I could to avoid rubbing salt into the wound. This woman is doing the exact opposite. She\u2019s trying to rub it in, and your in laws are awful for not calling her out on it or being more supportive.", "NTA - It sounds she like is the golden child and nothing you or your husband will do will ever be good enough. I\u2019m guessing it will be the same for any possible children you may have. Hers will always be better. It is probably beneficial for your husband to go LC/NC at this point too. Your husband sounds amazing and supportive. This can be a very stressful situation for a marriage. I hope you have other supports in place since his family is not an option."]}
