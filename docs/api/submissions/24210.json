I'm sure you don't want to feel \"to blame\" for him lowering contact with his family. Remember that is their fault, not yours. You are doing nothing wrong, you are in grief and you are being very mature about it. Missing the baby shower was for sure the right decision - if you thought it was. Trust your gut, don't guilt yourself, and just take the time it takes to process this tragedy. If your in law's can't see that, don't expose yourself to them.

I'd love to know why she feels so much superior then you cause she got lucky because a lot off people fail to realise that depending on where you live 20% off pregnancies end in midcarriages.

You deserve time to heal and you have sought that space with far more grace than your feckless SIL deserves. She is harming you. She knows that what she is doing is harming you.

I\u2019m guessing it will be the same for any possible children you may have. Hers will always be better. It is probably beneficial for your husband to go LC/NC at this point too.

Listen, the aftermath of your emotions after a miscarriage are sneaky and persistent. You learn what hurts more and work to remove it until a time when it might not hurt as much.

It's more than this and seems like it ought to be less than that. It's over, but how could something so important be over without things to show for it all? \n\nSadly, someone who thinks they're doing good will be very motivated not to see that they've been hurtful.

I don\u2019t think you are actually stepping away from her pregnancy, it\u2019s from someone who is causing you mental harm because of her actions.\n\nI went to my friends baby shower three weeks after my 2nd miscarriage. It was the hardest thing I have ever done and I ended up leaving early. Everyone supported me fully and my friend thanked me for being there, acknowledging how hard it must have been. That\u2019s how your SIL should have behaved.", "NTA - I\u2019ve been on both ends of this now. I was someone suffering with infertility for 3 years watching everyone have their babies, some even then having their 2nd or 3rd while we had no success. Some days were just too hard to go to celebrations not just baby showers / kids birthdays but those were the hardest and most people understood because they had empathy. I even planned my sisters baby shower in this time and it was one of the hardest days I\u2019ve ever gotten through. You feel so incredibly selfish that you\u2019re saddened by someone\u2019s happiness but you aren\u2019t wishing they didn\u2019t have that happiness, you are wishing you were along side them celebrating the same happiness. \nNow flash forward to this year, we did ivf and I\u2019m 23w pregnant but my SIL had a MC 2 weeks before we found out we were pregnant and then another one when I was around 18w. I\u2019m absolutely devastated for her and have made a point to be selective on what I speak to her about, definitely not complaining to her about pregnancy related things or expecting her to open up about what she went through. I wait for her to start that discussion and try to make sure she knows I\u2019m here but also not have her feel overwhelmed and triggered by me. I know this is what I needed when I was dealing with my own losses and trauma. \n\nYour SIL clearly does not have this empathy and sounds incredibly selfish. I would say that I could give some forgiveness to the first conversation I could overlook as insensitive but oblivious as most people who haven\u2019t been through it are but given she also had been told by other people to be mindful it\u2019s a very minimal understanding. The only person starting drama is her, you did not scream or blow up. You communicated that somethings were too hard for you and you needed to remove yourself from a situation harming your mental health. She crossed that boundary and wants to blame you for her own behaviour.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you have to go through these struggles and then on top of that have people not support you in your healing journey how you need. No one has a right to tell you, you\u2019re wrong with how you handle your boundaries. I wish you and your husband all the best on your journey.", "We can't decide when and how we grieve. Good on you for going NC with your SIL. Wish you all the strength!", "sorry for your loss. NTA she was so far out of line that a jupiter was calling to pass through", "NTA.  You are obviously going through a really hard time and your SIL's insensitivity to that is astounding.  I'm glad your husband has your back.  Hugs x", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss", "NTA!! I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I had a miscarriage in august 2021 and I was basically a nonhuman for over a month.\n\nThe day I miscarried I told my mom and she told me that it was a good thing because now I could decide if I \u201creally\u201d wanted a baby."]}
