{"id": 1388, "submission_id": "ymator", "title": "AITA for being glad that my friendship with my friend is coming to an end?", "selftext": "So this friend of mine decided to stop speaking to me after he felt that I am giving him relationship advice which he didn't want in the first place. I understand I may be an AH. But the problem was I never knew he was getting uncomfortable. He never even gave me a hint that it was something that bothered him. So I decided to unfollow him on social media, where I was active. Mind I didn't block him. My WhatsApp is open for him, calls and even dm me. It's I felt as if it will give a relief from questioning whether I am the AH every time I see his posts. It wasn't to hurt him but help myself from getting hurt. Soon after this friend reach out to my best friend to tell me that he is being unfriended by me. So now the story changed as to why he stopped speaking to me. Now he is saying it was because I never pick up the phone when he calls and gets late to text back. Okay, I am not very good at calling or replying unless there is a message that says urgent or someone is dying. I don't know what I call it but it's this feeling as it's a difficult task to deal with people at particular times. It's the same response to anyone except my husband. Everyone knows about it. So even this friend. So now he is telling me that he was giving me the same treatment and I decided to get all upset. And he brought up the fact that I couldn't get him anything for his birthday. Now the thing  I got to know this friend when I was having a high-paying job and after leaving it I am getting only 1/3 of what I was getting. Life is hard for me. It's not that I did not get him a gift it was that the gift which I brought for him did not fit and the store refused to exchange it. So I promised him that I will get him something when I get my salary but unfortunately, I have not been able to save money coz he is expecting a expensive gift which I can't effort at this moment. Everyone I spoke to him I keep on reminding him that I will get him something of the value he is expecting soon. Now I am upset and wanted to confront him but I am not a confrontational type. \n\nOr AITA by not confronting and try to sort things out?", "created_utc": 1667596880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymator/aita_for_being_glad_that_my_friendship_with_my/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
