I (44 M) hosted, usually my sister and I switch off host duties. \n\nMy sister has 2 daughters who are incredibly picky eaters at 18 and 15 years old. My sister would come to family parties with a box of pasta and a bag of frozen chicken tenders that she will make for her daughters. \n\nI want to know if I\u2019m an asshole for what I did here. I knew that is her drill with them, but I\u2019ve always found it to be very annoying especially when I\u2019m trying to cook and she\u2019s taking up space making the pasta and chicken tenders. \n\nThis year I told my wife we will not be letting my sister in the kitchen this year and the girls will have the choice of eating what I prepared or not eating. My sister accused me of being a cynic and getting joy from watching the girls be uncomfortable. I told her they are old enough to eat like adults. \n\nAlso the food I make is pretty standard. I do a fillet roast, bbq ribs, cheesy potatoes, stuffed artichoke, breaded cauliflower, ratatouille, and a salad. Certainly some of these must be foods that an 18 and 15 year old should be able to eat. Well the girls sat and ate bread and butter while telling me that my food looked gross. I looked to my sister to calm them down but the told me I deserved this and it\u2019s not their fault for being picky eaters. \n\nI know I could have just let my sister do her thing but it was the principle of the situation. I\u2019m not sure if I was being a petty asshole or if I had a legitimate reason to be upset.\n\nEdit: there are no medical conditions or food allergies.\n\nEdit: i made it clear to my sister in advance that I would not be allowing this. She decided not to listen.\n\nEdit 3 I did not anticipate this blow up. I am willing to compromise. If the girls really won\u2019t try new things my sister can make their food at home and bring it.", "created_utc": 1670260537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdcw81/aita_for_not_allowing_my_sister_to_make_her_kids/", "score": 9069, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No ones being forced at gunpoint to eat what you make. They can eat before or after the party if starvation is such a risk.", " NTA - they are 18 and 15, not little kids. They can be picky, you don\u2019t have to accommodate that. It\u2019s very annoying to have someone come into the kitchen and taking up space when you\u2019re cooking a big meal.", "NTA.  You told your sister ahead of time that you would not allow her to use your kitchen.  If she was that concerned, she could have decline your invite or fed her kids before showing up.  Her kids being rude was uncalled for.", "NTA at 15 and 18 they should be able to eat more than just pasta and chicken tenders. Per OP\u2019s comments there\u2019s no allergy/intolerance, they\u2019re just picky. And rude. Who sits at a table and talks about how gross the food looks?? \n\nCooking for a family holiday can be so stressful, timing everything just right and making sure you have the space to cook everything. Adding in another meal just because they\u2019re picky? Nope, OP does not have to do that", "NTA but I do think you could have compromised a little bit by asking your sister to cook beforehand and warm up the plates in the microwave. I love to cook and I really hate people getting in my way so I understand why you're annoyed. I'm a pretty picky eater too so I get her side of that as well. Before family functions when I know there is going to be very little I can eat, I eat before the dinner so I'm not starving. This seems like a pretty easy problem to solve for everyone involved.", "NTA\n\nThese are not children, they\u2019re teenagers fully capable of trying new foods. I might\u2019ve tried to compromise with, \u201ctry a bite of everything, and then you can go make your noodles and nugget if you still want.\u201d And 15 and 18, mom doesn\u2019t need to make them special meals anymore; they can do that themselves.", "NTA. They're guests in your home and their mother doesn't need access to your kitchen. I'd never dream of using someone else's kitchen and being in their way just to sate my picky LEGAL ADULT and teenager who isn't far behind. If they were picky toddlers, maybe. They don't have to eat at the event if they don't want to. They were warned in advance. They could have eaten before they came. I say this as a former incredibly picky eater.\n\nIf the family goes out to dinner is mommy back in the professional kitchen slinging tendies?", "NTA - My mother taught me it\u2019s rude not to eat what a hosts makes, unless you have an allergy or something.", "Absolutely NTA - you clearly set boundaries for your kitchen and your home while preparing a feast for them. It is extremely disrespectful to offend the cook while they are preparing a meal let alone a feast! I would have been beaten over the head if I was so ungrateful for a Christmas feast. These kids are obviously spoiled and need to grow up. Their mom is bending the world around them and teaching them how to be very bad guests in other peoples homes. Maybe they\u2019ll have the luxury of mommy cooking and housing them for the rest of their lives but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have boundaries in your own home.", "NTA\n\nUnless you said they couldn\u2019t bring already cooked food from home, they could have done that and microwaved it. But you don\u2019t need to cater to an 18 year old that doesn\u2019t eat anything besides chicken tenders.", "As a picky eater myself, your NTA. Both of your sister\u2019s children are at an age where they should be at least trying new foods and not having the same thing each time. Your sister is enabling them by cooking them food she knows they will eat; this would be okay if they were much younger or had a medical need for this, but by the sounds of it neither apply. The one daughter is 18 technically an adult, the other is 3 years from being an adult. As you age your taste buds change, from the sound of it neither of the girls have tried the foods they used to hate when younger to see if they like them now. Both of the girls are going to have difficulties as they grow when it comes to food because of all this.", "NTA, when you said kids in the title I assumed you meant actual kids, not a teenager and a legal adult (in the UK at least)", "NTA\n\nYour sister is not doing her children any favors, rather what she has allowed to happen is going to cause them issues until they stop being picky.  Comfort foods are good for some times and places, but if it is all they will eat, it is going to create some situations where it is going force them to end up losing a few relationships either friends or those who would marry them.\n\nI once knew a young woman, who would end up refusing to eat chicken on the bones and someone had to take and debone it.  She was in shock when she found out that I would not do such, and let her decide to eat or not.", "NTA. Her daughters are not kids, those are teenagers that can eat before they arrive, after they leave or bring their own precooked food. Why they think it's okay to take space in your kitchen when you're prepping for a party is crazy. Also, it's odd that she makes their frozen chicken tenders they should be old enough to do that on their own.", "NTA. My daughter finally gave up on being a picky eater because she got tired of going to bed hungry. It would be embarrassed to be an 18 yr old and only eat chicken nuggets and fries.", "They may be picky eaters, and they may only be able to eat the bread rolls as a picky eater.  But you know who sits there eating only bread rolls and saying that the food looks gross?  Assholes.  Op, you\u2019ve accommodated their asshole behavior long enough.  NTA.", "NTA. One child is a legal adult and mommy is still making her chickie nuggies?", "NTA. why can\u2019t she feed them before hand or make the food and bring it to your house and just heat it up in your microwave? Better yet why can\u2019t the kids do that for themselves? 15 and 18!?! Wow", "NTA. At 18 and 15 those girls need to grow up and eat what the host makes when they go somewhere for dinner. Your sister isn\u2019t helping them by pandering to their picky eating habits.", "I am a little surprised at the answers here...I think you are NTA, your sister enables them to be picky eaters and has their whole lives. They are young adults, there is going to be uncomfortable situations through the rest of their life. We have all gone through it and we got over it. You shouldn't have to accommodate them in your own house. That's the thing, it is YOUR house. For those saying YTA, would you let someone (family or not) walk into your house and do whatever the fuck they wanted?! My guess is no.", "If you knew they like chicken tenders, why not just serve those as well? It is a family dinner and everyone should be able to eat what they fancy.", "NTA. The girls are 15 and 18 with no reason to avoid the various foods that were cooked. They could have tried something. Does your sister not realize how hectic is can be to took all this foods without her in there cooking a specific meal for only her two grown children? If it was really that big of an issue, couldn\u2019t she have brought their food premade?", "NTA but you should have let your sister and nieces prepare their food beforehand and have them heat it in the microwave. My (now deceased) stepdad was an awesome guy but was a straight up \u201cgeneric\u201d food guy who simply never expanded his tastes to include most of what you served. We used to tease him about it but it was his choice. We loved him so always made sure to include a few options that he would eat.", "NTA, sister can baby her teens at home.", "NTA.\nYou warned her.\nAnd not est if food is one thing, making comments on \u2018food being gross\u2019, is incredibly rude.", "If there is truly no real reason they cannot eat other food, then I\u2019d say NTA.  Are you sure they are not on the Autism spectrum?  I do know of several people who are, and food choice and texture is a very big thing, which limits what they are comfortable eating.", "NTA I hope they enjoy their vitamin deficiencies.", "NTA if they were younger, I'd say she could have microwave space. But honestly if I am cooking a large meal, I don't need someone taking up burners or the oven to make baby food for nearly grown teenagers. They should be able to manage basic eating at someone's house style etiquette. Very best of luck to your sister who will reap what she does with those two.", "I'm gonna say NTA because I have 2 cousins like this.\n\n23/24m and 21m. As kids, they always ate the same thing at dinner night after night. The parents never forced them to just open up their palettes. The older one is better now but the younger ONLY eats his mom's cooking. When he moved for college, he didn't like any of the food from the school and around him so his mom would cook a week's worth of food, freeze them and deliver it to him once per week.\n\nYeah, these kids didn't choose to be picky because mom taught them to be picky by never teaching her kids to eat other things.", "NTA the party is at your house and you get to make the rules. This goes beyond them being picky eaters. It seems more like they\u2019re becoming entitled and rude AH. They\u2019re old enough to be able to function in public without getting their way", "As long as you informed your sister in advance, NTA. She may want to enable her daughters; you have no obligation to do so.", "NTA, if they don\u2019t want to eat fine. She\u2019s doing them no favors going along with this, they aren\u2019t children. If she wanted she could bring something to warm up real quickly. But there would be no being rude to me in my house. I would have asked them all to leave until they learn how to act when they are guests in someone\u2019s home.", "NTA \n\nThey're old enough to deal with it. They can make something themselves and bring it to the gathering or eat before/after.", "I don't think you need to tell them to eat what you're offering or not eat. But you are TOTALLY within  your rights to say that if they bring food it needs to be ready to eat without interfering with your meal prep. So NTA, but with an adjustment.", "Naw man at that age they oughta buck up and eat what\u2019s presented. They\u2019re 18 &15, not 8 &5", "Here's a question. If you know they are picky and that you are cooking multiple dishes, could you not have just cooked them some pasta yourself? One that everyone would enjoy along with everything else? \nCall me old fashioned but when I host I want people to ENJOY themselves. And that includes making food people like.", "NTA. I am surprised by all the votes otherwise. \n\nI can't imagine ever turning up at someone else's house and expecting them to let me prepare food while they are cooking a meal. And it is an intrusion because often when you are cooking a big deal, you are already balancing multiple items and the burners and oven are all already in use. \n\nMy 11 year old is picky. He does not like most holiday dinner food and often fills up on bread and cheese. But he would never comllain about the food or call it gross. \n\n15 and 18 are old enough to eat ahead of time and certainly old enough not to call the food gross. Them eating nothing but bread isn't a big deal, complaining makes them assholes.\n\nBut...OP it wouldn't have killed you to make a side dish or something that you know they like. Or even cheese and crackers as an appetizer. It is almost E-S-H for that and the fact that you didn't want your sister ahead of time", "NTA. If the kids was 5 and 8 years old, then yeah, you would have been the AH. But they are 15 and 18 years old. They have to get over themselves", "NTA  Your sister knows that you're going to be occupying your kitchen trying to cook the meal that you're serving to everyone ...so why couldn't she just make something ahead of time at her house and bring it?  Why does she have to actually cook it at your house?", "Your sister was right about one thing, it's not their fault they're picky eaters, that's completely your sister's fault. \n\nNTA, I would've possibly added mashed or fried potatoes to the dinner to have something simple/starchy with all the amazing dishes you were serving, but since there was bread and butter they could eat. They weren't starving, and there seemed to be a LOT of choice.", "NTA. Was leaning the other way until I saw the ages. What are they gonna do as adults? Bring chicken tendies to every get together?\n\nIn all seriousness, maybe next holiday could be a potluck situation where everyone brings something. That way you can sidestep the awkwardness.", "NTA. I understand having a preference but I feel like that\u2019s just ridiculous and if anything it shouldn\u2019t interfere with what other people have going on.(interrupting your cooking and the flow of the party in general) Like go to McDonald\u2019s or something before you come if it\u2019s absolutely that serious.", "NTA. Those are going to be the least popular girls if they have to bring prep and cook their own food at parties! The mom is allowing them to be awful. How are they going to date if the only eat pasta and chicken tenders. I had to check the ages because it seems like you put an unnecessary 1 before their ages. Please have updates about how they get kicked out of important work diners because there is no kiddie food lol. All events will be out of reach unless the mother can make kiddie food how embarrassing. Your kitchen you rules for all the naysayers this is not related to allergies or illness. So just no!", "Could she not cook the food at home and bring it for the kids? Or couldn't you have cooked some pasta if you knew they like it?", "NTA.\n\nYou don't need someone getting in the way in your kitchen whilst you're trying to cook for your guests. Your sister could have offered to bring something cold that her daughter's could eat.\n\nIt was unfair for your sister to suggest you deserved the insults your nieces made about your cooking. That's just impolite.", "NTA. Those kids are spoiled brats. They could eat before they come of over if it was that big of a deal. America has become a population of people who get what they want when they want it and while this speaks volumes about our success, it is not without its development flaws.", "NTA. If they were 5, I\u2019d say you were too harsh. But they should be able to try the food offered just as they would at a friend\u2019s home. It would be a kindness if you can have one plain item.", "NTA. If they want to act like babies, she can feed them at home. Don't come to someone else's house who prepared a nice meal with processed junk food and insist it gets served with the meal. I hate people who infantilize their children and expect others to do the same.", "Info:\n\nWhat principle are you defending? Why do you care what they eat?", "Esh. The food you listed are not standard and even though they sound good I definitely would not have enjoyed most of that when I was a teenager. I\u2019m giving you an esh because of your attitude for the whole things. Picky eaters get judged constantly and I have definitely met people who will get legit sick when pushed outside of their comfort zones. I have pretty extreme anxiety and will have trouble eating most foods in certain uncomfortable situations. If someone spoke down to me because of that I\u2019d probably never go to an event they were hosting again but I\u2019m an adult who actually gets to make choices like that. \n\nYour sister is also the ah here because she feels entitled to others kitchen because of her children. She should them up fast food on the way or bring already prepared food in a warming bag if she wants her children to have individual options. A kitchen gets crazy stressful while cooking holiday meals without a random person running around trying to make solo meals.", "NTA, prepared food that could be heated for a few minutes in the microwave? Sure, but wanting to actually cook in the kitchen where the main food is being cooked? Not acceptable at all", "NTA - they have no food issues and they are coming off as extremely rude and entitled.", "YTA. Why invite them over? Or honestly just cook something extra/ different for them?", "I think it's fair that you don't want sister in the kitchen interrupting while you're cooking, & your nieces seem to have a dreadfully limited palate.  Still, YTA for saying your nieces have to eat what you prepare or nothing at all.  Tell your sister to bring something precooked or that she can quickly heat up right before you guys eat.  That would be a much more reasonable compromise.", "ESH - you should have picked *not christmas* to decide to set your new rule, in my opinion. \n\nYour sister should have handled this a long time ago. She should bring a cooked dish for them to share, or let them be hungry and eat bread, but she should not be demanding she gets to cook during a cooking holiday when every burner is sacred, and then blaming the host.", "Chicken tenders and pasta? Quite a diet. NTA. If they choose not to eat anything else let them eat bread and butter and sooner or later they will realize that they can at least marginally broaden their culinarily horizons.", "As an incredibly picky eater myself, NTA. \n\nI\u2019m my case, I have a texture issue and I\u2019m pretty averse to trying new things in public, at this point (30 years old) it\u2019s mostly because it\u2019s embarrassing (to keep it short) and I feel more comfortable trying new things in the comfort of my home where I know I can make a back up meal if I really end up not liking something.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve been to family functions throughout my entire life where I\u2019ve known there would be food I didn\u2019t like. When I still lived with my parents they NEVER brought different food for me to eat. I always just ate the food I did like, and then they\u2019d pick me up something on the way home or I\u2019d make myself something when we got back. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason your sister couldn\u2019t do the same for her daughters. It\u2019s your home and if you don\u2019t want her cooking there for any reason then you have a right to tell her no.", "NTA\n\nYou are cooking for a holiday party.  Stressful and utilizing the entire kitchen probably.\n\nAt 15 & 18, these kids should in theory be able to handle something more than chicken strips and pasta, but they may have food issues.  Either way, if you are not going to eat the food your host is preparing, bring your own food.  You don't push yourself into someone's kitchen while they are preparing another meal.  Beyond rude.", "I wonder what they eat at home.", "YTA You want them to \u201ceat like adults\u201d. Cool. Adults get to choose what they eat without other adults forcing them eat their vegetables.", "INFO: why couldn\u2019t she bring pre-cooked food that could simply be microwaved for the girls?

If it\u2019s such an issue eat before or after, or snack on random things until later. It\u2019s literally not that serious. NTA.", "NTA. If they really needed something different (pasta and chicken), your sister could have prepared them before hand and brought them. I was that picky eater at Thanksgiving as a kid, but I would never have told the host their food looked gross, especially once I became a teenager.", "She\u2019s enabling them and they need to grow the f up. NTA", "I\u2019m incredibly surprised about the tone here. I agree, NTA. What kind of diet consist of only pasta and chicken tenders besides that of a toddler. It\u2019s terribly unhealthy.", "NTA - but tell her to make the food at home and she can use the microwave when it's near dinner time", "NTA my daughter has legitimate sensory issues with food due to being on the autism spectrum. But even she can usually find something to eat", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because you warned them before hand and also because I find that an 18 (and even a 15) year old having a diet that only consists of pasta and chicken nuggets to be pretty embarrassing.", "NTA.  It is incredibly annoying to try an prepare a meal while somebody else is in the kitchen preparing another meal.  If they wanted different food then they needed to bring something that required no preparation (McDonald's comes to mind).  And at 18 and 15 they should be old enough to sit at a table like adults and not make rude comments.", "NTA I've always been a picky eater (getting better though) and I would NEVER do this nor did my parents ever do anything like this for me. If there was an ingredient in something that I didn't like, I just did my best to pick around it. Or I would just eat the few things that fell within my picky boundaries. All your sister is doing is teaching them that the world should bend to their preferences, and that's just not reality!", "NTA-as a picky eater, i get the struggles of not liking certain things and not eating certain things that other people have made but they cannot go their whole lives eating chicken tenders and pasta, trying new things can be hard but can also be a good expanding experience instead of the same thing all the time and if they truly can't handle eating something new, their mother could just pre-make the food at their own house, and then reheat portions in the microwave right before everything is ready instead of take up the space needed for the food that everyone else is eating. OR feed her kids ahead of time instead of enable this rude behavior.", "NTA\n\nAlso, it's extremely rude to sit there and proclaim your food to be gross. They are beyond old enough to try new things. And they are light years past being old enough for basic manners.", "NTA, I know you mentioned no allergies, but do they have developmental or neurological disorders? If they don't have any disorders, then they're way to old to be acting like this.", "NTA because you told her in advance. They could have eaten at home. But lots of people are picky eaters and thats just how it is. My oldest daughter is beyond picky-it's a texture thing with her. My other daughter eats just about anything so it's not something I've done. It's just who she is.", "18 and 15 are you kidding", "They did one thing right, which is to content themselves with bread if there is nothing they cared to eat.\n\nBut making negative comments demonstrates a complete and total lack of basic table manners. They are old enough to know better. This is on them and their mother.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.", "I thought you were going to say they were 5 and 8.

Monopolizing the kitchen right before dinner is flat out rude and obnoxious.", "I\u2019m sorry but 18 and 15 years old, and all they eat is pasta and chicken nuggets? \nMy 16 month old eats a lot more than that. \n\nYour sister is enabling shitty behavior, and you\u2019re totally NTA for communicating that you will not be enabling it at your home. \nWhat you made sounds delicious and if your sister actually gave a shit about her kids, she would\u2019ve made them try some of it.", "NTA at the very least they could make what they want and bring it with already prepared instead of being in the way. \nBut if there are truly no medical issues.. they need to grow up and expand and mom needs to stop allowing this.", "NTA. They could have brought already prepared food to eat as another option. It's rude to add stress to  the hosts by taking up space in the kitchen at a busy time. And i hope there was a separate little kids' table for these babies!", "NTA. It\u2019s long past time for them to stop eating like toddlers.

No medical issues, no allergies, and it seems like no diagnosis of a sensory issue that would prevent certain textures unless you\u2019re leaving that out. They can grow up a bit and branch out their pallet, or being the food already cooked and just microwave it. Not monopolize your kitchen.", "Jesus. My 7 mo old daughter has a larger range of food she\u2019ll eat beyond pasta and nuggies. She ate turkey heart the day after Thanksgiving for crying out loud.

When it comes to picky eaters they should at least get a small serving to see what works and what doesn't. I mean if it doesn't look super fantastic but smells good it's worth tasting in my book. Nta in my opinion", "Under 5 - whatever keeps the littles occupied while the adults enjoy a meal.   \n15 and 18, if they just want bread and butter thats on them.  However they are damn sure old enough to know telling a host their food looks 'gross' is rude as hell.  NTA.  \nSaying this as someone that has had cousin on my wife's side that had a severe mental hangup to eating anything other than 3 or 4 core foods right thru adulthood.  Super nice and smart guy, otherwise well rounded. Also never complained about what was served but just would choose to down a bag of doritos alone later and sit quiet during dinners.  He finally got help by licensed psychologist in his 20s when it really impacted his dating and social life. Most potential partners expect a dinner date at some point and only so long you can hide that big turnoff.  Not to mention he was developing hypertension and other medical issues very young due to nearly zero vegetables in his diet.", "NTA. That should have eaten before. Stand your ground. My 12 year old son is picky so sometimes he\u2019ll eat only bread and that\u2019s ok; sometimes he gets really hungry and surprise, curious about foods he usually doesn\u2019t eat. What\u2019s not ok is your sister not saying anything as her kids were saying at the table that your food is gross. Unacceptable and I would not be inviting them anymore.", "NTA\n\n18 and 15 are too old for this. Eating just salad is fine, but telling you your food looked gross is rude, and they need to knock that off. \n\nA dietary restriction is one thing, preferences are another, and they need to either bring their own fully cooked dish themselves pot luck style (using your kitchen adds to logistics and mess), not accept the invite, or eat what they can and keep their comments to themselves for the rest.", "NTA: She was told in advance and could have prepared the food in advance.\n\nAnd regardless of what you do or don't eat it's rude to tell your host the food they prepared looks gross.\n\nThose daughters have some interesting dates in their future.

They're both old enough to have a mature conversation about their needs.

They are the time for people to get together, have fun and eat whatever they want.", "YTA. \n\nYes the fact that an 18 year old and 15 year old will only eat pasta and chicken tenders is not something that would fly in my family. At the same time, that feels like an antiquated view of being a head of household or forcing yourself on others.  Honestly, why do I give a shit if people (that are not my children to raise) go through life eating chicken nuggets and what impact does it have on me? \n\nThat's really the questions here- how does their picky eating impact you? The only way it does, as you pointed out, was that it gets in the way of you cooking. That is totally fair! That would be annoying and distracting, and I have a small kitchen so would totally throw me off. But the answer is to compromise- can she bring something that can just be thrown in the oven for 10 minutes towards the end? That means the oven is already on, she isn't in the way, and only dirties one pan. That feels like a small burden, and one we often take on for family, like when I make potato salad normally, and a small dish of it with no onions for my partner. Is that burden really more than watching two people not eat at a holiday meal?\n\nI just, don't understand the \"principle\" of it? Was it to embarrass the girls, to assert your dominance in your own home, to demonstrate that you don't want to be bothered while cooking? That their style of eating is just patently offensive? That you weren't allowed to be a picky eater so how dare they? Whatever the reason, it goes back to my general stance on this kind of stuff, which is \"how does this impact me?\" And from your story, the only impact is that it is in some way offensive to who you are as a person for them to eat this way. \n\nAnd I know the comments that are coming my way (if anyone reads it) so let me just say again. I wouldn't raise my hypothetical children to eat two things, but as I live my life I see people with so many legitimate reasons- and lame ones- for eating the way they do and I just can't seem to give a shit about principle. You want some frozen nuggets? Here is my air fryer, this roast is the bomb so your loss.", "[deleted]", "YTA. There's no grown up or children's food.

With such simple foods like pasta or frozen chicken, I'd be embarrassed to even ask my sister to bring tnem... I'd ask for favorite brands and then prepare them for the kids too.", "YTA. That sounded like a fun Christmas party! As you knew that your sister would follow this routine of cooking at your place, couldn\u2019t you have asked her in advance to cook it at her place as there is limited space in the kitchen?

There\u2019s no virtue in this line in the sand you drew.", "Esh\n\nWhat she did is a little rude, but then the list of \"pretty standard\" food you gave was almost anything but, especially for a picky eater.

Stuffed artichoke and breaded cauliflower... in what world are those pretty standard, just the sound and my inner picky eater comes back out. Salad... super vague. \n\nIf you knew they were coming, and didn't want her making them food, maybe tone down the spread, not saying noodles and grilled chicken... but stuffed artichoke sounds like it looks like an alien egg. \n\nTheir mom does need to teach them that not everyone will make them chicken and noodles though.", "ESH\n\nYour timing for sticking to your principles is bad. So, a little bit TA. You could have just said, \"I need unfettered access to my kitchen for this party. If you have to bring food for your kids please do not expect space at the stove/oven/counter because I will be using these things while hosting.\" This come across as petty and it seems you know that.\n\nThat said it's really unreasonable for your sister to expect others to cater to her teens' food preferences to this degree (not NEEDS, preferences). She is the bigger AH. Does she make people who are not family set her up to cook in their homes to accomodate her kids? If her kids are so picky why aren't they the ones cooking? Teenagers can boil pasta. And she's encouraging them to be rude and tell the host his cooking is disgusting? It's intergenerational assholery.

SPD, autism, allergies etc?", "NTA", "I understand not wanting more traffic in the kitchen during the holidays, it gets hectic and depending on the size of your kitchen it can be a real pain in the ass. You\u2019re not the TA for not wanting your sister to cook while you\u2019re in there. \n\nYou are TA for preventing your nieces from having their preferred foods. In your post and comments, you mention them *not* having allergies, dietary restrictions, or other issues like neurodivergence that could cause aversions to food. I don\u2019t believe that at face value. They\u2019re both girls in their teen years. Often times it\u2019s harder for women to be properly diagnosed with mental conditions because they don\u2019t always present the \u201ctypical\u201d symptoms or markers. Unless your sister has the official all-clear from mental health professionals for her daughters, I wouldn\u2019t rule it out. \n\nIf they aren\u2019t ND and are just truly picky eaters, who honestly cares as long as they\u2019re eating? Controlling what they eat just sounds like you\u2019re on a power trip with your weird holiday menu (yes, weird, that\u2019s not a standard menu at all). Maybe try compromising instead of creating drama where there doesn\u2019t need to be? Let their mom either bring prepared food for them or let her cook there, but still ask that the girls at least try one bite of various foods. *Ask*, don\u2019t demand or force them to. As a picky eater myself (with some sensory issues to boot), people being patient with me when they tried to get me to try new foods worked WAY better than your method. I still have and like my \u201csafe foods\u201d but I\u2019m willing to try other things at my own pace.\n\nYTA", "YTA what gives you the right to dictate what someone else should eat, or even likes for that matter? Do you want someone forcing you to eat the food you don\u2019t like or go hungry? Especially a family member? Who\u2019s hosting and invited them over?  Who also KNEW they would not eat what you served? What an AH stunt. \n\nYour sister went out of her way to bring food for her daughters that she knew they\u2019d eat. You didn\u2019t pay for it. She didn\u2019t ask you to accommodate them. She also took the responsibility to make their food for them. She didn\u2019t ask you to be inconvenienced by cooking it for them. Sure, she was in the kitchen \u201ctaking up space\u201d, but Let\u2019s call a spade a spade. It\u2019s not the space issue, or the fact she was in your way. it\u2019s the fact you don\u2019t approve of the girls\u2019 picky tastes which lead to all this to begin with. Point made since this has been going on for years and it\u2019s only an issue now. \n\nI\u2019ll give a little slack because she brought food that needed to be prepared before serving when she could have planned ahead to prepare some dishes to pass that her daughters would eat. Or she could have prepared meals for them that needed no preparation like sandwiches or cold lunch style meals. She didn\u2019t, so that was a little lacking on her part, but overall that\u2019s minor considering the circumstances. Still you knew this was a thing for years and knew it would happen again. You still chose to host and still chose to make a meal they would not eat and then refuse to let your sister make food for them for purely selfish reasons \u201ctaking up space\u201d getting in your way. You could have avoided it altogether had you made a family dish or two they would eat too. \n\nWhat exactly do adults eat like? Oh right, whatever they want, because no one tells them what they have to eat. So you\u2019re a hypocrite too. You expect them to eat like adults, but try to force them to eat what you provide as if they\u2019re children or go hungry. Double standards. You took on the responsibility of hosting. That means you are taking on the responsibility of accommodating guests. That\u2019s the proper etiquette, yet you served a meal willfully excluding food that your nieces would eat. You didn\u2019t even try to make a single dish they would eat. That\u2019s very rude considering you know they are picky and would not eat your food. \n\nIt\u2019s not like your hosting a public event. I\u2019ve been to plenty public events where the invited guests still get a meal choice. The last one I was at was a choice of beef or salmon. So even public event hosts treat the guests more respectfully than you treat your nieces. \n\nBtw. My 23 yr old SIL is an incredibly picky eater too. What do I do? I make food for our family gatherings that I know he will eat even if it\u2019s not our traditional stuff. Example: Thanksgiving dinner this year was our traditional feast of turkey, gravy, dressing, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, Cheesy carrots, green bean casserole, roasted Brussels sprouts, cranberry compote, buns, pumpkin and apple pies, but also included garlic bread, fettuccine Alfredo, fruit salad, corn on the cob, and banana cream pie because these are foods I know he likes and will eat. Did it inconvenience me? Does it drive me nuts that he\u2019s picky? Absolutely, but I love and respect him enough to do it and tolerate his eating preferences.", "YTA. op said he wouldn\u2019t have allowed outside god AT ALL meaning if the sister wanted to cook at home then bring it, she couldn\u2019t. \nyou aren\u2019t living their life. you have no idea why they are picky eaters. maybe they\u2019re recovering from eating disorders, maybe they\u2019re neurodivergent, or maybe people are just allowed to be picky.  them eating their own food isn\u2019t going to bother anyone.", "YTA Why are people so obsessed with what other people eat?

I (44 M) hosted, usually my sister and I switch off host duties. \n\nMy sister has 2 daughters who are incredibly picky eaters at 18 and 15 years old. My sister would come to family parties with a box of pasta and a bag of frozen chicken tenders that she will make for her daughters. \n\nI want to know if I\u2019m an asshole for what I did here. I knew that is her drill with them, but I\u2019ve always found it to be very annoying especially when I\u2019m trying to cook and she\u2019s taking up space making the pasta and chicken tenders. \n\nThis year I told my wife we will not be letting my sister in the kitchen this year and the girls will have the choice of eating what I prepared or not eating. My sister accused me of being a cynic and getting joy from watching the girls be uncomfortable. I told her they are old enough to eat like adults. \n\nAlso the food I make is pretty standard. I do a fillet roast, bbq ribs, cheesy potatoes, stuffed artichoke, breaded cauliflower, ratatouille, and a salad. Certainly some of these must be foods that an 18 and 15 year old should be able to eat. Well the girls sat and ate bread and butter while telling me that my food looked gross. I looked to my sister to calm them down but the told me I deserved this and it\u2019s not their fault for being picky eaters. \n\nI know I could have just let my sister do her thing but it was the principle of the situation.

Because OP doesn't allow any food they would eat, so what should they do?", "Ope, edit: OP responded that they are not diagnosed with any conditions (that doesn't mean they can't be undiagnosed though--see my paragraph about underdiagnosis of autism in women below) \n\nNeurodivergency is not just autism. And when it is it's not always high-support needs or \"obvious\" autism. Other things that fall into the umbrella of neurodivergent: ADHD, ADD, OCD, and mood disorders (BPD, bipolar, NPD), sensory processing disorder, etc. Depression and anxiety are also often included (varies by source and study), and many other conditions. All of those conditions can affect every aspect of a person and that includes their relationship with food. All of those conditions are neurodivergencies. Many of those conditions are under diagnosed in females because the symptoms present differently, ESPECIALLY autism but also the other ones. Here's an example specifically relating to autism. [(X)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-020-00197-9)\n \nIt has been supported in studies like [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477986/) that self identified adult picky eaters have poorer mental health (in this study's case picky eaters specifically scored higher for OCD and depression traits). Therefore there is a higher percentage of them, and any other picky eater you've met, to be neurodivergent/mentally ill. Which makes sense because human nature is to NOT be a picky eater. Now, this could be a neurodivergency they were born with or something introduced by their mother. Either way, they're suffering and struggling every time they try to eat and it is not their fault. \n\nThere is also an eating disorder that relates to being a so called \"picky eater\" called ARFID (avoidant restrictive eating disorder) it is especially common among autistic people but anyone can develop it. It is as you can imagine very painful, perhaps it will even ring a bell to what you went through in the past. It is likely in fact that those people who you know have had eating issues, but were otherwise \"neurotypical\" either weren't actually neurotypical or were and developed ARFID due to their parents.  ([X](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/arfid.html#:~:text=What%20Is%20ARFID%3F,poor%20growth%20and%20poor%20nutrition)) Often times, people who have ARFID prefer processed food because of the textural differences that can be found in other foods. This is obviously not healthy which is why it's an eating disorder, but recovery is tricky and sometimes not even possible, and it's certainly better for a person to eat only processed foods than nothing at all. \n\nAlso, while we are talking about evidence, let's remember that we are going entirely of of OP's depiction of his sister. We have no bearing on who this woman is or if she is actually a bad mother. Is she a bad mother? Or is that OP's opinion while others, her children, and medical/state professionals opinions reflect that she's good or at least not that bad? Did she put this upon her children? Or were her children born with sensory processing differences and she is supportive?\n\nMaybe it's her fault. Maybe it's not. But guess who's fault it's not? And who OP is affecting the most by taking away their comfort foods? The kids.\n\nOn top of that, the kids OP is posting about are just that, children. I don't care if 18 is technically an adult, that is still a teenager who is mostly ignorant. It's just plain mean to affect their holidays so drastically especially if OP claims to care. \n\nRegardless of if you think their eating habits are healthy or not, this is not the way to go about trying to persuade change. The only way to get through to a picky eater is slowly. Maybe the mom has been trying and she is dealing with a case of undiagnosed autism in her children. Maybe she's not trying, her children are neurotypical been encouraging the picky eating. Even if she has, the only thing tearing away a comfort food from a picky eater is going to accomplish is creating a hostile, combative environment for everyone involved. All it's going to do is damage his relationship with his nieces out of self importance and pettiness. Those girls are never going to want to open up to him about their eating issues, even if he wants to help in the future, because they've been ridiculed by him. They also might buckle down thinking that they are fully right and healthy and might become more adverse to help. On top of that, they just deserve empathy. Being a picky eater is taxing. \n\nHere is my conclusion:\n   * Maybe they are neurodivergent or mentally ill, maybe they aren't and it's mom's fault. Either way, picky eating is painful, and pulling this stunt is only going to push them away more and cause imbalance in the family when OP could be making actual helpful moves towards picky eating recovery.", "did you not read what i said?. or any other comment for that matter. the OP could've allowed the sister to bring food already prepared if the main issue was the sister cooking in the kitchen but no OP decided to be the AH and not let them bring any food. and again if you read what i said. the OP could've asked what the teens like or what they could've made so everyone had something they could eat and enjoy. so the sister didn't just barge in.
