They have a lot in common, they both like music, running/working out, art, tv shows etc and they both are at the same university albeit doing different courses.\n\nMy daughter visited me/us (wife and her brother) and she basically let a lot of stuff out about her friendship with this girl recently. She talked about how she feels like their friendship will never be close knit like she wants. She talked about how she feels her friend is way closer to her childhood friends and how she feels jealous seeing pictures on social media of them on nights out and partying. She feels like her friend is talking to her less and less (both in person and social media) and not making time for her. She talks about how shes gone back through her old social media and feels jealous seeing the old photos of her friendship with her childhood friends. Finally she said the straw that broke the camels back for her was that, on her birthday 2 weeks ago, her friend didn't wish her  happy birthday, she said she tried to then visit her friend at her accommodation but no answer. She mentioned how she feels betrayed with how she made a big presentation for her friends birthday earlier this year. She was really emotional throughout this telling.\n\nMy wife/her mum obviously was trying to console her and telling her to keep working on it. I however had a different stance. I told her basically that she's never going to be on the same level as her friend's childhood friends. They've been friends since childhood, they've gone through school and all those trial together and they know each other inside out. I told my daughter that she has to accept this when maintaining her friendship with this girl, I advised her to try to look back at her friendship with her friends over the years, work on consolidating connections with them and that there is nothing wrong with being less emotionally invested in this friend.\n\nOn top of all this, one other important detail (I didn't say this to her), her friend is 20, she is 25. To put that age difference into perspective, she was born in the 1990s (last millennia) while her friend was born in 2003. Their childhoods/experiences are broadly similar but that difference is difficult to ignore.\n\n\nMy daughter didn't react well to my advice. She said that I was telling to settle for less and \"I'm putting her down\" and she said that feels a big \"connection\" with her friend, which I had no real answer too. We got into an argument, I told her to grow up and she left.\n\nI do feel how she's acting is incredibly childish, however I do feel empathetic for her as the last few years have  difficult for her socially and I feel her social skills have really declined. On top of that, having met her friend personally, she is a really lovely,warm,friendly and sweet girl and I can see why my daughter feels close with her.", "created_utc": 1683723116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dpqtv/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_will_never_be_on/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter isn't reading the room properly. She is acting like a kid with a one-sided crush. This other person doesn't owe her a close intimate friendship or a spot amongst her tier 1 friends.", "NTA\n\n Your daughter seems really invested in this friend. Like, a lot. I think the other girl started to get uncomfortable with this and began to ghost her slowly. I know i would.", "NTA and you\u2019re not wrong. The relationship this friend has with her childhood friends will never be the same as the friendship she has with your daughter. The age gap can also play a big part in the dynamic as well. She got mad because it\u2019s not want she wanted to hear. You said nothing about her \u201csettling for less\u201d just trying to explain that these two friendships are completely different. Has you daughter always had issues like this either making friends or the emotions she feels around her friendship?", "So they became \"friends\" when your daughter was 21 and the other girl was 16? Your daughter got weirdly obsessed with a kid, no wonder the girl is uncomfortable. NTA, but there are bigger issues here than the childhood friends thing.", "NTA sounds like your daughter is being creepy and this friend is backing away. Also, isn\u2019t it strange that a 21 year old wanted to have a deep friendship with a teenager in the first place?", "NTA\nUnfortunately, your daughter is behaving like a pushy, clingy guy who won't take no for an answer.", "NTA. But there are additional issues with your daughter\u2019s near-obsession with this younger woman\u2019s life.", "NTA if someone i was trying to distance myself from showed up at my door on their birthday, i would probably never talk to them again. That said, i think it would be good for you to address the actual issues of the relationship - becoming friends later in life does not exclude an incredibly close relationship. She needs - and deserves - to understand that that is not the issue at hand, but that there is an unhealthy, one-sided, pushy dynamic at play.\n\nETA: i think the point i was trying to get across is that you should try to help her understand, regardless of what the reason is for her friend pulling back (\"short\" friendship, age gap, growing apart, etc.) she has to respect that decision", "NTA, but she's 25 and lacking some social awareness. Is it just the pandemic lockdowns or was she like this younger? Because this reads a bit obsessive compulsive to be going through this friends entire social media history and trying to one up her childhood friends. \n\nGood luck sorting this one out.", "What the hell is this?  Counselling for friends?  Friendship therapy?  Friends come and go all the time.  Her friend clearly doesn't feel as close to your daughter as your daughter does to her... AND THAT'S FINE. The solution isn't to \"keep working on it\" but to \"find some new friends\". That may sound harsh, but she's 25.  Certainly she's had the displeasure of watching a few friendships wither away over the years.  It happens to everyone.  Why is this one so damn special?", "NTA, when you have to spell this to a 25 year old, you got bigger problems in life.", "I mean tbh I don\u2019t think you phrased it as well as you could have, but NTA. 25 is plenty old enough to understand that friendships don\u2019t always last and sometimes gradually end. At this time this friendship sounds one sided and she should not try to focus on just this one girl.", "your daughter is 25? NTA. she needs to grow up. not everyone will want to be her dearest closest friend.", "This is not necessarily about age or length of relationship, so I am not sure your perspective tells the full story\u2014it\u2019s as simple as \u201cshe\u2019s just not that into you\u201d unfortunately. NTA though. Chasing after people doesn\u2019t work.", "Nta. Why is your 25 year old daughter hangout out with then getting jealous of a teenager?  You were right in telling her the truth. They\u2019re at 2 different places in life", "NTA, but maybe make it clear that while THIS friendship didn\u2019t work out it doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t form meaningful relationships in adulthood. And that a closeness she is feeling may take years to form. \n\nThe fact that no happy birthday was said and the avoidance of plans is a red flag that your daughter is more invested in the relationship than the friend. And to me it means she should invest her time and energy into other existing friendships and/or put herself out there to meeting new people with whom a wonderfully close friendship could form.", "NTA, it sounds like your daughter is coming on a bit strong and maybe the friend is trying to put some distance between them. What you told her was good advice as it sounds like she needs a reality check. \n\nOther comments seem to be implying that your daughter has been up to something sinister; I think that\u2019s a bit of a harsh conclusion to jump to. I saw you mentioned that her social skills took a bit of a hit during the pandemic so this situation seems to make sense.\n\nIt might just be that the kind of friendship your daughter is offering to this girl is just a bit too intense for her. That doesn\u2019t make anyone the bad guy, but your daughter will need to accept that they\u2019re not as close as she wants them to be.", "NAH, maybe? Because I think you're correct about this friendship, but absolutely incorrect that friends made as an adult will never be as close as childhood friends. There's like, one person from my childhood I still talk to? And we're still friends, but we have much less in common than my friends I've made as an adult. People change so much when they grow up and move out on their own, adult friendships can be very deep and fulfilling if you actually put effort into them. The bonds that are built when facing \"adult\" issues together and supporting each other in life and experiencing joy and pleasure together are in my experience much stronger than whatever circumstances push childhood friends together. Alternatively, some adults choose to focus only on romantic partners and not on building a wider network of love and support, which is why they may not experience adult friendships as being as important and meaningful as childhood ones.", "INFO\n\n> My daughter met this girl 4 years ago\n\n> they both are at the same university albeit doing different courses\n\n> her friend is 20, she is 25\n\nA 16yo was at university with a 21yo? That is a fucked-up age difference for a friendship at this stage in life.", "Nah\u2026I think in a way you were right, but maybe could have been said differently.  I feel she can be just as good a friend as this other girls childhood friends, but on a different level.  The issue here is a 25 year old crying over this and having an obsession with this girl and their friendship.  I guarantee the other girl, no matter what the age, is rethinking this friendship.  Your daughter sounds unhealthy about this friendship and this is why the other girl is distancing herself.  It has nothing to do with her childhood friends relationships but the relationship between her and your daughter, who admits she is jealous.  Your child needs to look at herself and her behavior and maybe seek therapy.", "I am sorry OP but you are really really off. Many times childhood friends grow apart because they were created out of necessity (we are in the same class ) or distance (we live next to each other) or other reasons (parents are friends).  These friendships are not easy to stand in time because distance will change, lifestyles, work, family. And sometimes friends created after 20-25 are more meaningful. The issue is that every case is different, there is no rule. You went and a) shot down her effort to just vent (sometimes people just want for a loved one to listen, not an advice or a solution b) made your own assumptions. You have no idea about what that girl thinks, their relationship, if she is really cares about befriending your daughter or if she is that kind of person that bores easily and has never really close friends. You also try to impose your opinions on her (how adult for you for your argument to be \"grow up\"). If you can't console someone just keep your thoughts to yourself. You were not appointed by a judge to arbitrate in their case so you have to be fair and make a decision (even for that you would need much more info and common sense). Like some commenters here you created a story in your mind \"omg she is clingy that is why the other girl doesn't want her friendship\". No data whatsoever. Commenters are going for it. The sure thing is you being there for a sad kid that her friend didn't even wish her happy birthday is a big nope for you. YTA", "NTA", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have quite a lot of friends but literally ZERO from my childhood. And I have friends much older and much younger than the five-year gap you are citing. So this is also not the reason. \n\nYou were correct though that the friend is not that much into your daughter, but that is much more likely because your daughter seems to be unhealthily obsessed with the friend. It is a very normal thing to do some things with another group of friends, and the jealousy is inappropriate. Your daughter sounds very clingey, and it would be more helpful for you to point out this as it is possibly driving other people away. And remember that even if you do nothing wrong not everyone would want to be besties with you or share your idea of friendship.\n\nThe behavior of your daughter would drive me off as well because I find her idea of friendship and the way she approaches it weird and I would not feel at ease.", "YTA\n\nNot for the sentiment, but for the delivery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously one has a different relationship with someone one has known all one's life. Or with someone who is in the same life phase and all that... she'll grow apart from some of the friends once some have kids and some don't, for example.

She has unrealistic expectations from this girl that will probably never be fulfilled.   Why push for a one-sided friendship that will end up hurting her in the long run.  The only thing I would have said differently is that her friend and their childhood friends are not on the same level as your daughter, and she deserves better.", "YTA, there's no inherent law that says you can't form as close friends as childhood friends as an adult. Nor that a 5 year old difference makes a friendship less inimate. Whether your daughter has a healthy relationship to this friendship, it doesn't seem like you are offering any constructive advice, but rather just spouting your own prejudice about how friendships work.", "YTA There are some issues in this dynamic, but they are not what you brought up. You are wrong about how friendships work. Sometimes childhood friendships are the \u201cmost meaningful\u201d but not always. Sometimes people grow apart.

I have friends I have known since I was 6 and we are like sisters but I also have friends that i\u2019ve made in adulthood that I also feel as close to. The issue here is that your daughter isnt reading the friendship correctly. Regardless of this girls other friends, she isnt placing the same priority on her rship with your daughter as she is. Some people are ok with this and have a lot of less close rships but your daughter is pushing where she maybe shouldnt be. Tbh stalking her socials and feeling jealousy shows an unhealthy attachment and perhaps this isnt helping the friendship any because it likely spills over. \nIm gonna say you should have said it better. Maybe tell her to stop focussing on this one girl and try to cultivate more/wider array of friends rather than \u2018you cant compete\u2019.

We learn as adults that the deepest friendships have a common bond like school, university, sports, etc and took hundreds of hours to form that shared connection.

We met 5.5 years ago. We are so close we practically have the same thoughts. I have several very long-term friends including friends from my school days but she is my absolute best friend. Prior to this friendship, my best friend was another woman I met as a 30+ adult.\n\nI do think your daughter needs to learn healthier boundaries and how to accept when people do not want to be as close to her as she wants to be to them.

If you start squeezing in a panic at losing a few grains, you're going to lose everything.", "And that makes total sense. Lockdowns effect people in all kinds of different way. Failing her class and being out of touch with friends during that time, She\u2019s feeling \u201cless than\u201d to herself and sounds like she projecting those feelings into her friendship.
