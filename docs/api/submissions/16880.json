They have a lot in common, they both like music, running/working out, art, tv shows etc and they both are at the same university albeit doing different courses.\n\nMy daughter visited me/us (wife and her brother) and she basically let a lot of stuff out about her friendship with this girl recently. She talked about how she feels like their friendship will never be close knit like she wants. She talked about how she feels her friend is way closer to her childhood friends and how she feels jealous seeing pictures on social media of them on nights out and partying. She feels like her friend is talking to her less and less (both in person and social media) and not making time for her. She talks about how shes gone back through her old social media and feels jealous seeing the old photos of her friendship with her childhood friends. Finally she said the straw that broke the camels back for her was that, on her birthday 2 weeks ago, her friend didn't wish her  happy birthday, she said she tried to then visit her friend at her accommodation but no answer. She mentioned how she feels betrayed with how she made a big presentation for her friends birthday earlier this year. She was really emotional throughout this telling.\n\nMy wife/her mum obviously was trying to console her and telling her to keep working on it. I however had a different stance. I told her basically that she's never going to be on the same level as her friend's childhood friends. They've been friends since childhood, they've gone through school and all those trial together and they know each other inside out. I told my daughter that she has to accept this when maintaining her friendship with this girl, I advised her to try to look back at her friendship with her friends over the years, work on consolidating connections with them and that there is nothing wrong with being less emotionally invested in this friend.\n\nOn top of all this, one other important detail (I didn't say this to her), her friend is 20, she is 25. To put that age difference into perspective, she was born in the 1990s (last millennia) while her friend was born in 2003. Their childhoods/experiences are broadly similar but that difference is difficult to ignore.\n\n\nMy daughter didn't react well to my advice. She said that I was telling to settle for less and \"I'm putting her down\" and she said that feels a big \"connection\" with her friend, which I had no real answer too. We got into an argument, I told her to grow up and she left.\n\nI do feel how she's acting is incredibly childish, however I do feel empathetic for her as the last few years have  difficult for her socially and I feel her social skills have really declined. On top of that, having met her friend personally, she is a really lovely,warm,friendly and sweet girl and I can see why my daughter feels close with her.", "created_utc": 1683723116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dpqtv/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_will_never_be_on/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter isn't reading the room properly. She is acting like a kid with a one-sided crush. This other person doesn't owe her a close intimate friendship or a spot amongst her tier 1 friends.", "NTA\n\n Your daughter seems really invested in this friend. Like, a lot. I think the other girl started to get uncomfortable with this and began to ghost her slowly. I know i would.", "NTA and you\u2019re not wrong. The relationship this friend has with her childhood friends will never be the same as the friendship she has with your daughter. The age gap can also play a big part in the dynamic as well. She got mad because it\u2019s not want she wanted to hear. You said nothing about her \u201csettling for less\u201d just trying to explain that these two friendships are completely different. Has you daughter always had issues like this either making friends or the emotions she feels around her friendship?", "So they became \"friends\" when your daughter was 21 and the other girl was 16? Your daughter got weirdly obsessed with a kid, no wonder the girl is uncomfortable. NTA, but there are bigger issues here than the childhood friends thing.", "NTA sounds like your daughter is being creepy and this friend is backing away. Also, isn\u2019t it strange that a 21 year old wanted to have a deep friendship with a teenager in the first place?", "NTA\nUnfortunately, your daughter is behaving like a pushy, clingy guy who won't take no for an answer.", "NTA. But there are additional issues with your daughter\u2019s near-obsession with this younger woman\u2019s life.", "NTA if someone i was trying to distance myself from showed up at my door on their birthday, i would probably never talk to them again. That said, i think it would be good for you to address the actual issues of the relationship - becoming friends later in life does not exclude an incredibly close relationship. She needs - and deserves - to understand that that is not the issue at hand, but that there is an unhealthy, one-sided, pushy dynamic at play.\n\nETA: i think the point i was trying to get across is that you should try to help her understand, regardless of what the reason is for her friend pulling back (\"short\" friendship, age gap, growing apart, etc.) she has to respect that decision", "NTA, but she's 25 and lacking some social awareness. Is it just the pandemic lockdowns or was she like this younger? Because this reads a bit obsessive compulsive to be going through this friends entire social media history and trying to one up her childhood friends. \n\nGood luck sorting this one out.", "What the hell is this?  Counselling for friends?  Friendship therapy?  Friends come and go all the time.  Her friend clearly doesn't feel as close to your daughter as your daughter does to her... AND THAT'S FINE. The solution isn't to \"keep working on it\" but to \"find some new friends\". That may sound harsh, but she's 25.  Certainly she's had the displeasure of watching a few friendships wither away over the years.  It happens to everyone.  Why is this one so damn special?", "NTA, when you have to spell this to a 25 year old, you got bigger problems in life.", "I mean tbh I don\u2019t think you phrased it as well as you could have, but NTA. 25 is plenty old enough to understand that friendships don\u2019t always last and sometimes gradually end. At this time this friendship sounds one sided and she should not try to focus on just this one girl.", "your daughter is 25? NTA. she needs to grow up. not everyone will want to be her dearest closest friend.", "This is not necessarily about age or length of relationship, so I am not sure your perspective tells the full story\u2014it\u2019s as simple as \u201cshe\u2019s just not that into you\u201d unfortunately. NTA though. Chasing after people doesn\u2019t work.", "Nta. Why is your 25 year old daughter hangout out with then getting jealous of a teenager?  You were right in telling her the truth. They\u2019re at 2 different places in life", "NTA, but maybe make it clear that while THIS friendship didn\u2019t work out it doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t form meaningful relationships in adulthood. And that a closeness she is feeling may take years to form. \n\nThe fact that no happy birthday was said and the avoidance of plans is a red flag that your daughter is more invested in the relationship than the friend. And to me it means she should invest her time and energy into other existing friendships and/or put herself out there to meeting new people with whom a wonderfully close friendship could form.", "NTA, it sounds like your daughter is coming on a bit strong and maybe the friend is trying to put some distance between them. What you told her was good advice as it sounds like she needs a reality check. \n\nOther comments seem to be implying that your daughter has been up to something sinister; I think that\u2019s a bit of a harsh conclusion to jump to. I saw you mentioned that her social skills took a bit of a hit during the pandemic so this situation seems to make sense.\n\nIt might just be that the kind of friendship your daughter is offering to this girl is just a bit too intense for her. That doesn\u2019t make anyone the bad guy, but your daughter will need to accept that they\u2019re not as close as she wants them to be.", "NAH, maybe? Because I think you're correct about this friendship, but absolutely incorrect that friends made as an adult will never be as close as childhood friends. There's like, one person from my childhood I still talk to? And we're still friends, but we have much less in common than my friends I've made as an adult. People change so much when they grow up and move out on their own, adult friendships can be very deep and fulfilling if you actually put effort into them. The bonds that are built when facing \"adult\" issues together and supporting each other in life and experiencing joy and pleasure together are in my experience much stronger than whatever circumstances push childhood friends together. Alternatively, some adults choose to focus only on romantic partners and not on building a wider network of love and support, which is why they may not experience adult friendships as being as important and meaningful as childhood ones.", "INFO\n\n> My daughter met this girl 4 years ago\n\n> they both are at the same university albeit doing different courses\n\n> her friend is 20, she is 25\n\nA 16yo was at university with a 21yo? That is a fucked-up age difference for a friendship at this stage in life.", "Nah\u2026I think in a way you were right, but maybe could have been said differently.  I feel she can be just as good a friend as this other girls childhood friends, but on a different level.  The issue here is a 25 year old crying over this and having an obsession with this girl and their friendship.  I guarantee the other girl, no matter what the age, is rethinking this friendship.  Your daughter sounds unhealthy about this friendship and this is why the other girl is distancing herself.  It has nothing to do with her childhood friends relationships but the relationship between her and your daughter, who admits she is jealous.  Your child needs to look at herself and her behavior and maybe seek therapy.", "I am sorry OP but you are really really off. Many times childhood friends grow apart because they were created out of necessity (we are in the same class ) or distance (we live next to each other) or other reasons (parents are friends).  These friendships are not easy to stand in time because distance will change, lifestyles, work, family. And sometimes friends created after 20-25 are more meaningful. The issue is that every case is different, there is no rule. You went and a) shot down her effort to just vent (sometimes people just want for a loved one to listen, not an advice or a solution b) made your own assumptions. You have no idea about what that girl thinks, their relationship, if she is really cares about befriending your daughter or if she is that kind of person that bores easily and has never really close friends. You also try to impose your opinions on her (how adult for you for your argument to be \"grow up\"). If you can't console someone just keep your thoughts to yourself. You were not appointed by a judge to arbitrate in their case so you have to be fair and make a decision (even for that you would need much more info and common sense). Like some commenters here you created a story in your mind \"omg she is clingy that is why the other girl doesn't want her friendship\". No data whatsoever. Commenters are going for it. The sure thing is you being there for a sad kid that her friend didn't even wish her happy birthday is a big nope for you. YTA", "NTA", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have quite a lot of friends but literally ZERO from my childhood. And I have friends much older and much younger than the five-year gap you are citing. So this is also not the reason. \n\nYou were correct though that the friend is not that much into your daughter, but that is much more likely because your daughter seems to be unhealthily obsessed with the friend. It is a very normal thing to do some things with another group of friends, and the jealousy is inappropriate. Your daughter sounds very clingey, and it would be more helpful for you to point out this as it is possibly driving other people away. And remember that even if you do nothing wrong not everyone would want to be besties with you or share your idea of friendship.\n\nThe behavior of your daughter would drive me off as well because I find her idea of friendship and the way she approaches it weird and I would not feel at ease.", "YTA\n\nNot for the sentiment, but for the delivery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously one has a different relationship with someone one has known all one's life. Or with someone who is in the same life phase and all that... she'll grow apart from some of the friends once some have kids and some don't, for example.

She has unrealistic expectations from this girl that will probably never be fulfilled.   Why push for a one-sided friendship that will end up hurting her in the long run.  The only thing I would have said differently is that her friend and their childhood friends are not on the same level as your daughter, and she deserves better.", "YTA, there's no inherent law that says you can't form as close friends as childhood friends as an adult. Nor that a 5 year old difference makes a friendship less inimate. Whether your daughter has a healthy relationship to this friendship, it doesn't seem like you are offering any constructive advice, but rather just spouting your own prejudice about how friendships work.", "YTA There are some issues in this dynamic, but they are not what you brought up. You are wrong about how friendships work. Sometimes childhood friendships are the \u201cmost meaningful\u201d but not always. Sometimes people grow apart.

I have friends I have known since I was 6 and we are like sisters but I also have friends that i\u2019ve made in adulthood that I also feel as close to. The issue here is that your daughter isnt reading the friendship correctly. Regardless of this girls other friends, she isnt placing the same priority on her rship with your daughter as she is. Some people are ok with this and have a lot of less close rships but your daughter is pushing where she maybe shouldnt be. Tbh stalking her socials and feeling jealousy shows an unhealthy attachment and perhaps this isnt helping the friendship any because it likely spills over. \nIm gonna say you should have said it better.

We learn as adults that the deepest friendships have a common bond like school, university, sports, etc and took hundreds of hours to form that shared connection.

You can get extremely close to someone in a short amount of time (which is why people don't often marry their childhood sweethearts, for example).

You're still her parent though, even though she's an adult, and you weren't out of line giving her the advice anyway. \n\nThat's it though, if she doesn't like your advice you let it go, you don't argue with her and belittle her. Frankly that's not a good tactic for changing someone's mind no matter what your relation.", "YTA, not only because what you said was unnecessarily cruel, it\u2019s also untrue. I met my best friend it my early twenties and I\u2019m closer to her than any of my friends from before. All friendships are different and you\u2019ve just made a generalization that probably made your daughter feel like she will never be able to gain new meaningful friendship that didn\u2019t start in childhood.\n\nYou could\u2019ve helped her see that *this specific friend* maybe doesn\u2019t value her like she deserves. You could\u2019ve validated her feelings and told her that it sucks when you are in a relationship of any kind where one person puts in more effort. You could\u2019ve told her that it\u2019s ok to let a friendship go if it is hurting her. You could\u2019ve assured her that she will make many new friends throughout her life who will see her as important and make the effort she deserves. \n\nYou didn\u2019t do any of that, you just told her she\u2019ll never be good enough. F- parenting on this one.", "YTA, very obviously tbh. It doesn't matter if that's true or not you didn't even try to console her. She's over here crying because she feels like she's being ghosted by someone she seemed close to and thought she was close to and your response is \"just deal with it and move on\" trying to make it sound like she's childish? \n\nAnd people trying to make it sound like she's being a selfish child because she wants to hold on to a friendship she enjoyed acting like she's being entitled or selfish is insane...\n\nYou could've tried to relate or give her advice about how to communicate with the friend or build a better bond or get her to do something that'll make her more comfortable making more friends or ease away from the friend but no you said she'll always be a second rate friend and she'll have to find someone from her past to maybe be closer with instead", "NTA. Not everyone views a friendship the same. Your daughter may think of this person as a best friend. This other person may think of your daughter as a casual friend. It is up to your daughter to understand where she stands and act accordingly.", "NTA. I don't think you phrased things perfectly, but you were absolutely right on a big-picture level. For example, it's not necessarily true that your daughter COULD never be on the same level as her new friend's childhood friends - my closest friend is someone I met as an adult - the point is just that she ISN'T on that level in her friend's social circle, for whatever reason. All the signs indicate that her friend doesn't feel they're as close as your daughter thinks they are, and is trying to pull back on the friendship. It's totally understandable that your daughter would feel hurt by that, but the solution is absolutely not your wife's advice to \"keep working on it\" (which I assume means, keep making grand gestures and pushing for lots of time with her friend who pretty clearly wants less), so it's good that you spoke up, and especially that you encouraged her to invest in some of her other friendships. I hope she eventually sees the value in that - maybe even in time to salvage a friendly acquaintanceship with this friend who wants a little more space from her, though unfortunately it seems likely your daughter will burn that particular bridge before she sorts herself out.", "Was ready to come blazing after ya but total NTA. You are right. You\u2019ve got to be careful with these adult friendships. They are primarily for fun and companionship. Don\u2019t try to take them deeper than they are, they\u2019ll run aground. They may develop deeper, with time and many shared experiences establishing a deeper connection, but only in time. Years. The childhood friendships took years to develop as well.", "NTA. You were honest.  She needed to hear that. Life is full of relationships where one gives more than the other and you have to decide if you can be ok with that. She\u2019s 25. Not 15.", "NTA. She needs to hear this", "NTA & agree with you 199%..  It takes time to develop that sort of relationship", "Everyone's social skills took a hit during the pandemic, it is easy to assume our kids are less capable than their peers, but it almost certainly is not true. \n\nYour daughter is better off looking for new friends rather than trying to resurrect childhood friendships.

If you want friends at 70... You get the idea.\n\nIt  sounds like your daughter is sporty, so she should join some sporty activities (e.g. indoor climbing) and meet new people.

Tell her to grow up and move on.", "YTA,\n\nHonestly... you just told your daughter that she needs to settle for acquaintance friendships. That she will never be good enough. Childhood friendships can last. They can also fizzle out. Both are normal. Your \"advice\" was putting your daughter down. And you're proud of that fact?! Your daughter is navigating a stressful time. She's trying to make friends as an adult. It's a whole hell of a lot harder to do that than as a kid. As a kid you can ask \"want to be friends\". As an adult you have to read all the social ques on if you need to push or pull back in the friendship.", "To pull an older reference out, your daughter is giving off SWF vibes.", "NTA.  Your daughter has issues with, I dont know what to call it - possessiveniss? co-dependency? enmeshment? a bit obsessive?  Her reaction isn't really normal. She might benefit from some counselling.  Does she have trouble making friends?  She should really have more than 1 friend in her circle so she isn't obsessing on that poor girl.\n\nETA I didnt realize the girl was a teen when your daughter met her.  Your daughter's reaction is inappropriate.  She should back off and try to connect with more people her age.", "I'm going with NTA, but I think you slid a toe into AH territory just because you don't seem like you offered much empathy first. Instead of saying 'yeah it's always hard when you feel a friend may be slipping away a bit' you went straight to the facts and 'well it's understandable, you'll never measure up to her childhood friends...' Maybe next time be a little gentler, and remind her that sometimes we have a friend we like to hang and watch TV with, sometimes a friend we like coffee and catch up with, and others for deep philosophical chats and that's okay. Different friends for different occasions, maybe only very few who we are so on the level with. You're not wrong, so NTA, but you could have been a bit kinder.", "INFO: So your daughter went to her friend\u2019s place without telling her? Is that right? Because OP, the way your daughter is behaving and her obsession is coming off as stalkerish and honestly really concerning \n\nThat and the fact that at 21 she befriended that girl when she was 16, that\u2019s not normal. If they had been childhood friends, more understandable but they aren\u2019t. \n\nYour daughter is coming on way too strong her friend is probably catching on how WEIRD it was that a 21 year old was so into her at that age and is now escalating.\n\nI saw your comment about your daughter being close to her mum (sounds unhealthy as well) but being close to a PARENT is very different then becoming close to a minor (at that time) with now family relation. \n\nLike, seriously OP. Reverse this situation and say a 21 year old had befriended your daughter at 16 and now, years later, shows up at her place without notice, is constantly demanding more intimacy and time, showing concerning jealousy and possessiveness. How would you view this situation? \n\nHell, even flip it and make the older one a man. It\u2019s showing a scary possessive pattern.", "NTA it seems like this friend is intentionally putting a little distance between them, likely because your daughter is pushing too hard.   Or perhaps they were never that close and your daughter misread the whole thing?  \n\nIt's really hard when you realize that a friendship is not equal, and that the other person doesn't feel the same way.  I hope your daughter can understand that sometimes friends come and go, and that it's ok to be happy you had that person in your life when you did, and that sometimes those people aren't with us as we move forward.", "NTA\n\nFrom what you've described, it does sound like preteen drama.\nAs for the jealousy issue, I have to agree that it's not really normal for a 25 year old to be jealous of a friend, especially one who is much younger. It's possible that your daughter is struggling with some insecurity or other personal issues that are causing her to feel this way. \nIn terms of the friend distancing herself, it's understandable that she might feel uncomfortable with the situation. It's always important to respect people's boundaries, especially when they are trying to distance themselves from us. I can understand why your wife gave the advice she did, but it's important to keep in mind that sometimes the best thing we can do is just let people go and move on. \n\nIf I were in your daughter's shoes, I would try to focus on making new friends in my age group and not investing so much in one particular person. This way, she can avoid feeling jealous or left out, and she'll have more opportunities to socialize and have fun with people who are more in her age range. \n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you and your daughter all the best in navigating this situation!", ">she was born in the 1990s **(last millennia)**\n\nWhy did you feel the need add that?", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Not necessarily. This is a good age difference for a cool older sister/mentor dynamic; I had a similar relationship with an older cousin. The issue is that once the younger friend becomes a young adult themselves, either the dynamic changes or the relationship does. At 16 I was very flattered that my university student older cousin was taking so much notice of me and introduced me to experiences my parents wouldn't allow me to try alone, and I was very invested in our relationship. At 20 I was in university myself and was spreading my wings, I was putting my time and energy into other things and people; but by then she was a working professional in her first serious relationship, not hanging around my campus demanding all my attention.", "Yikes! That is problematic. I am betting that now that the other woman is 21 she is realizing how off it is that a 21 would try to become such close friends with a 16 year old. Those are completely different points of development. As a 16 year old I am sure she felt flattered and perhaps sophisticated thinking that this older (cooler) woman thought she was a peer. But now as a 21 year old she is realizing how creepy that is unless there was an actual reason for the relationship - family tie, mentoring program, etc. NTA.", "I don't know how relevant this is but I have to mention that she and her mum are basically best friends. My wife on a lot of posts online refers to her as her \"little princess\". She's a real mummy's girl and maybe that could have made the age difference seem less relevant to her. I'm obviously not criticizing either of them for that but maybe it did have an effect.", "No she was still in secondary school. My daughter was in university, however she failed that course and is now trying again.", " I had to tell her I was napping to get her to leave me alone. Her behavior caused me to distance myself from her. Your daughter needs to learn to give people space.", "Why is the mere age difference creepy? It is not sexual, why couldn't a 21 yo befriend a 16 yo? This seems a very weird take to me.", "I'm surprised I had to scroll down for this take - I think the daughter was venting as opposed to wanting a real solution.", ">\"All friendships are different and you\u2019ve just made a generalization that probably made your daughter feel like she will never be able to gain new meaningful friendship that didn\u2019t start in childhood.\"\n\nYou just hit the nail in the head.

I have a really close relationship with my cousins who is 6 years older and she took me out all the time throughout my teenage and young adult years. There were also Seniors in college my Freshman year who took me under their wing (small campus and everyone lived in dorms where the floors were mixed grade levels to create community). But, my cousin is family and the seniors sort of were too by the end for the year - they weren\u2019t random people I started talking to at the end of an event.", "That's... that's a whole new can of worms. Your wife has convinced your daughter that she's entitled to that friendship. Her (autonomous!) friend has a life that doesn't include her and she's upset. She wants all of her friends' attention - which absolutely *is* childish - and she's not getting it, so is trying to force it. \n\nShe was an adult who made friends with a younger girl she could manipulate.

Also, it's not just the age difference that makes it creepy, it's the age difference paired with how the daughter is acting and feeling.", "I do not see any substantial differences between how men and women handle their friendships, and I do not think it is even relevant in this case.\n\nThe fact is that the daughter is too intense for the friend, and would probably be for most people. Friendship is always mutual, and you cannot force anyone to be your friend. As simple as that, and gender does not play any role in this.\n\nAnd as to your first paragraph - yes, you are right that some people do remain close with their childhood friends and some don't, and I never denied this. I only pointed out that what OP told his daughter (that childhood friendship will ALWAYS trump the \"newer\" one) is just not true (bc sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't).", "[removed]", "150%.

Lockdown really did a number on some people\u2019s mental health and it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s coping very well and is somewhat spiralling.
