They have a lot in common, they both like music, running/working out, art, tv shows etc and they both are at the same university albeit doing different courses.\n\nMy daughter visited me/us (wife and her brother) and she basically let a lot of stuff out about her friendship with this girl recently. She talked about how she feels like their friendship will never be close knit like she wants. She talked about how she feels her friend is way closer to her childhood friends and how she feels jealous seeing pictures on social media of them on nights out and partying. She feels like her friend is talking to her less and less (both in person and social media) and not making time for her. She talks about how shes gone back through her old social media and feels jealous seeing the old photos of her friendship with her childhood friends. Finally she said the straw that broke the camels back for her was that, on her birthday 2 weeks ago, her friend didn't wish her  happy birthday, she said she tried to then visit her friend at her accommodation but no answer. She mentioned how she feels betrayed with how she made a big presentation for her friends birthday earlier this year. She was really emotional throughout this telling.\n\nMy wife/her mum obviously was trying to console her and telling her to keep working on it. I however had a different stance. I told her basically that she's never going to be on the same level as her friend's childhood friends. They've been friends since childhood, they've gone through school and all those trial together and they know each other inside out. I told my daughter that she has to accept this when maintaining her friendship with this girl, I advised her to try to look back at her friendship with her friends over the years, work on consolidating connections with them and that there is nothing wrong with being less emotionally invested in this friend.\n\nOn top of all this, one other important detail (I didn't say this to her), her friend is 20, she is 25. To put that age difference into perspective, she was born in the 1990s (last millennia) while her friend was born in 2003. Their childhoods/experiences are broadly similar but that difference is difficult to ignore.\n\n\nMy daughter didn't react well to my advice. She said that I was telling to settle for less and \"I'm putting her down\" and she said that feels a big \"connection\" with her friend, which I had no real answer too. We got into an argument, I told her to grow up and she left.\n\nI do feel how she's acting is incredibly childish, however I do feel empathetic for her as the last few years have  difficult for her socially and I feel her social skills have really declined. On top of that, having met her friend personally, she is a really lovely,warm,friendly and sweet girl and I can see why my daughter feels close with her.", "created_utc": 1683723116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dpqtv/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_will_never_be_on/", "score": 1425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter isn't reading the room properly. She is acting like a kid with a one-sided crush. This other person doesn't owe her a close intimate friendship or a spot amongst her tier 1 friends.", "NTA\n\n Your daughter seems really invested in this friend. Like, a lot. I think the other girl started to get uncomfortable with this and began to ghost her slowly. I know i would.", "NTA and you\u2019re not wrong. The relationship this friend has with her childhood friends will never be the same as the friendship she has with your daughter. The age gap can also play a big part in the dynamic as well. She got mad because it\u2019s not want she wanted to hear. You said nothing about her \u201csettling for less\u201d just trying to explain that these two friendships are completely different. Has you daughter always had issues like this either making friends or the emotions she feels around her friendship?", "So they became \"friends\" when your daughter was 21 and the other girl was 16? Your daughter got weirdly obsessed with a kid, no wonder the girl is uncomfortable. NTA, but there are bigger issues here than the childhood friends thing.", "NTA sounds like your daughter is being creepy and this friend is backing away. Also, isn\u2019t it strange that a 21 year old wanted to have a deep friendship with a teenager in the first place?", "NTA\nUnfortunately, your daughter is behaving like a pushy, clingy guy who won't take no for an answer.", "NTA. But there are additional issues with your daughter\u2019s near-obsession with this younger woman\u2019s life.", "NTA if someone i was trying to distance myself from showed up at my door on their birthday, i would probably never talk to them again. That said, i think it would be good for you to address the actual issues of the relationship - becoming friends later in life does not exclude an incredibly close relationship. She needs - and deserves - to understand that that is not the issue at hand, but that there is an unhealthy, one-sided, pushy dynamic at play.\n\nETA: i think the point i was trying to get across is that you should try to help her understand, regardless of what the reason is for her friend pulling back (\"short\" friendship, age gap, growing apart, etc.) she has to respect that decision", "NTA, but she's 25 and lacking some social awareness. Is it just the pandemic lockdowns or was she like this younger? Because this reads a bit obsessive compulsive to be going through this friends entire social media history and trying to one up her childhood friends. \n\nGood luck sorting this one out.", "What the hell is this?  Counselling for friends?  Friendship therapy?  Friends come and go all the time.  Her friend clearly doesn't feel as close to your daughter as your daughter does to her... AND THAT'S FINE. The solution isn't to \"keep working on it\" but to \"find some new friends\". That may sound harsh, but she's 25.  Certainly she's had the displeasure of watching a few friendships wither away over the years.  It happens to everyone.  Why is this one so damn special?", "NTA, when you have to spell this to a 25 year old, you got bigger problems in life.", "I mean tbh I don\u2019t think you phrased it as well as you could have, but NTA. 25 is plenty old enough to understand that friendships don\u2019t always last and sometimes gradually end. At this time this friendship sounds one sided and she should not try to focus on just this one girl.", "your daughter is 25? NTA. she needs to grow up. not everyone will want to be her dearest closest friend.", "This is not necessarily about age or length of relationship, so I am not sure your perspective tells the full story\u2014it\u2019s as simple as \u201cshe\u2019s just not that into you\u201d unfortunately. NTA though. Chasing after people doesn\u2019t work.", "Nta. Why is your 25 year old daughter hangout out with then getting jealous of a teenager?  You were right in telling her the truth. They\u2019re at 2 different places in life", "NTA, but maybe make it clear that while THIS friendship didn\u2019t work out it doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t form meaningful relationships in adulthood. And that a closeness she is feeling may take years to form. \n\nThe fact that no happy birthday was said and the avoidance of plans is a red flag that your daughter is more invested in the relationship than the friend. And to me it means she should invest her time and energy into other existing friendships and/or put herself out there to meeting new people with whom a wonderfully close friendship could form.", "NTA, it sounds like your daughter is coming on a bit strong and maybe the friend is trying to put some distance between them. What you told her was good advice as it sounds like she needs a reality check. \n\nOther comments seem to be implying that your daughter has been up to something sinister; I think that\u2019s a bit of a harsh conclusion to jump to. I saw you mentioned that her social skills took a bit of a hit during the pandemic so this situation seems to make sense.\n\nIt might just be that the kind of friendship your daughter is offering to this girl is just a bit too intense for her. That doesn\u2019t make anyone the bad guy, but your daughter will need to accept that they\u2019re not as close as she wants them to be.", "NAH, maybe? Because I think you're correct about this friendship, but absolutely incorrect that friends made as an adult will never be as close as childhood friends. There's like, one person from my childhood I still talk to? And we're still friends, but we have much less in common than my friends I've made as an adult. People change so much when they grow up and move out on their own, adult friendships can be very deep and fulfilling if you actually put effort into them. The bonds that are built when facing \"adult\" issues together and supporting each other in life and experiencing joy and pleasure together are in my experience much stronger than whatever circumstances push childhood friends together. Alternatively, some adults choose to focus only on romantic partners and not on building a wider network of love and support, which is why they may not experience adult friendships as being as important and meaningful as childhood ones.", "INFO\n\n> My daughter met this girl 4 years ago\n\n> they both are at the same university albeit doing different courses\n\n> her friend is 20, she is 25\n\nA 16yo was at university with a 21yo? That is a fucked-up age difference for a friendship at this stage in life.", "Nah\u2026I think in a way you were right, but maybe could have been said differently.  I feel she can be just as good a friend as this other girls childhood friends, but on a different level.  The issue here is a 25 year old crying over this and having an obsession with this girl and their friendship.  I guarantee the other girl, no matter what the age, is rethinking this friendship.  Your daughter sounds unhealthy about this friendship and this is why the other girl is distancing herself.  It has nothing to do with her childhood friends relationships but the relationship between her and your daughter, who admits she is jealous.  Your child needs to look at herself and her behavior and maybe seek therapy.", "I am sorry OP but you are really really off. Many times childhood friends grow apart because they were created out of necessity (we are in the same class ) or distance (we live next to each other) or other reasons (parents are friends).  These friendships are not easy to stand in time because distance will change, lifestyles, work, family. And sometimes friends created after 20-25 are more meaningful. The issue is that every case is different, there is no rule. You went and a) shot down her effort to just vent (sometimes people just want for a loved one to listen, not an advice or a solution b) made your own assumptions. You have no idea about what that girl thinks, their relationship, if she is really cares about befriending your daughter or if she is that kind of person that bores easily and has never really close friends. You also try to impose your opinions on her (how adult for you for your argument to be \"grow up\"). If you can't console someone just keep your thoughts to yourself. You were not appointed by a judge to arbitrate in their case so you have to be fair and make a decision (even for that you would need much more info and common sense). Like some commenters here you created a story in your mind \"omg she is clingy that is why the other girl doesn't want her friendship\". No data whatsoever. Commenters are going for it. The sure thing is you being there for a sad kid that her friend didn't even wish her happy birthday is a big nope for you. YTA", "NTA", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have quite a lot of friends but literally ZERO from my childhood. And I have friends much older and much younger than the five-year gap you are citing. So this is also not the reason. \n\nYou were correct though that the friend is not that much into your daughter, but that is much more likely because your daughter seems to be unhealthily obsessed with the friend. It is a very normal thing to do some things with another group of friends, and the jealousy is inappropriate. Your daughter sounds very clingey, and it would be more helpful for you to point out this as it is possibly driving other people away. And remember that even if you do nothing wrong not everyone would want to be besties with you or share your idea of friendship.\n\nThe behavior of your daughter would drive me off as well because I find her idea of friendship and the way she approaches it weird and I would not feel at ease.", "YTA\n\nNot for the sentiment, but for the delivery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously one has a different relationship with someone one has known all one's life. Or with someone who is in the same life phase and all that... she'll grow apart from some of the friends once some have kids and some don't, for example.

She has unrealistic expectations from this girl that will probably never be fulfilled.   Why push for a one-sided friendship that will end up hurting her in the long run.  The only thing I would have said differently is that her friend and their childhood friends are not on the same level as your daughter, and she deserves better.", "YTA, there's no inherent law that says you can't form as close friends as childhood friends as an adult. Nor that a 5 year old difference makes a friendship less inimate. Whether your daughter has a healthy relationship to this friendship, it doesn't seem like you are offering any constructive advice, but rather just spouting your own prejudice about how friendships work.", "YTA There are some issues in this dynamic, but they are not what you brought up. You are wrong about how friendships work. Sometimes childhood friendships are the \u201cmost meaningful\u201d but not always. Sometimes people grow apart.

I have friends I have known since I was 6 and we are like sisters but I also have friends that i\u2019ve made in adulthood that I also feel as close to. The issue here is that your daughter isnt reading the friendship correctly. Regardless of this girls other friends, she isnt placing the same priority on her rship with your daughter as she is. Some people are ok with this and have a lot of less close rships but your daughter is pushing where she maybe shouldnt be. Tbh stalking her socials and feeling jealousy shows an unhealthy attachment and perhaps this isnt helping the friendship any because it likely spills over. \nIm gonna say you should have said it better.

We learn as adults that the deepest friendships have a common bond like school, university, sports, etc and took hundreds of hours to form that shared connection.

You can get extremely close to someone in a short amount of time (which is why people don't often marry their childhood sweethearts, for example).

You're not wrong, but you shouldn't have argued with her about it.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like she came to you for advice, more to just generally vent. You're still her parent though, even though she's an adult, and you weren't out of line giving her the advice anyway. \n\nThat's it though, if she doesn't like your advice you let it go, you don't argue with her and belittle her. Frankly that's not a good tactic for changing someone's mind no matter what your relation.", "YTA, not only because what you said was unnecessarily cruel, it\u2019s also untrue. I met my best friend it my early twenties and I\u2019m closer to her than any of my friends from before. All friendships are different and you\u2019ve just made a generalization that probably made your daughter feel like she will never be able to gain new meaningful friendship that didn\u2019t start in childhood.\n\nYou could\u2019ve helped her see that *this specific friend* maybe doesn\u2019t value her like she deserves.

But try to gently get her to open up, that she seems really upset about this and maybe there is other stuff going on with her life that is making her feel more anxious/intense about their friendship? Does she have someone she can talk to about this stuff besides her parents? Honestly a therapist would probably help, not just in dealing with this specific issue but with her general life struggle right now, and helping her with techniques to deal with things like friendships and rejection.", "Nah, you kept it real with her rather than coddling or sugarcoating things.

Sadly, I first remarked on it in response to a narcissistic partner who was done love bombing me once I finally succumbed to him.

I didn't realize how deeply messed up so many of his actions were until much later, so I was reflecting to him on how it felt like I was struggling/grasping to hold him, and it made him push away faster, and I wanted to have a conversation on why that seemed to be happening.\n\nAnyways, it all worked out, aka no idea what he's doing or where he is, but I am now in a healthy marriage, kids, house, etc with someone who is stable, has a job, and treats me wonderfully and reciprocal to how I treat him.

Her behaviour does seem to be getting pretty full on and her mom is doing her no favours by encouraging it.\nI do challenge your reasoning though. I've made many new friends at different stages of life. In some cases we're just as close as, or closer than, we are to our respective childhood friends, its just different. Similarly,  a 5 year difference is more significant at her age than mine but in my late teens I made plenty of friends who were older than me (because I was a musician and spent time in mixed age groups).", "I agree here. My best friends are the ones I made in college while still being very close with those I had through elementary. So all in all, I don\u2019t think his advice was incredibly accurate.

NTA for OP", "OP wrote Mum instead of Mom- I'm guessing Australian or UK where intense lockdowns were imposed three years ago?

Making any friends as a grown up is so hard.", "Your daughter sounds like she might need to get a little bit of counseling because it's not normal to feel jealous of what people did before they even knew you.

It's important, and a strong friendship that's been around for a while is very hard to get to the level of, but people have this funny way of talking about so much with their friends while saying nothing at all to them. They might be friends, but a lot of friends don't even really know each other. Of course, I'd hope that's not the case, but I'm just stating the observation that how long two people have been friends might not be the single most important factor.", "Pretty sure she's in love with the friend, which is either one sided or less serious on the friend's part.

It was emotionally draining and honestly felt like I was a crutch for them. I couldn't handle it after a while and had to distance myself. \nI would recommend that your daughter may have a chat with the friend and see how she feels about this as she may feel this is too intense. If she does then your daughter needs to relax for a bit and socialise with others.", ">she's never going to be on the same level as her friend's childhood friends.\n\nI don't necessarily agree with this statement because I find myself not being able to relate to my childhood friends the older I get. I'm closer to newer friends because they see me for me not who I used to be. \n\nThat said, your daughter is being creepy and pushy to the friend and that's why I think the friendship is not going to survive. She needs to have more boundaries and realize that people have boundaries with friends and it's okay. It also seems like the other girl doesn't consider your daughter as much a friend as she does and your daughter needs to realize that and make herself okay with that. Not everyone we feel a connection with will feel that connection with us and she needs to accept that. \n\nIt's not about age groups or childhood friends being closer, its simply about your daughter being clingy and not accepting that her friend is not that close to her as she wants her to be and that's her prerogative. \n\nESH - because you're making excuses for her rather than calling out your kid's behaviour which is only going to hurt her.", "InshaAllah NAH. Your daughter is going through a tough time.  You\u2019re frustrated because you aren\u2019t able to genuinely speak to her in a way which gets through to her.

Ask if she\u2019d like any advice when she\u2019s done, if she says yes, ask her what specifically she\u2019d like advice on and then go down that list of questions with her until she\u2019s satisfied. We gotta be patient with our kids as hard as it may be, there\u2019s a learning experience in there somewhere.", "NTA - \n\nat 25 years old she should accept it as youve said it.\n\nunfortunately.....tough....unless she goes back in time and makes friends with her ealrier, the level of friendship will be less.\n\nFriendships are also reciprocal....if she feels like her friend isnt putting in enough effort, then dont be friends.\n\nI had a friend try to pull the \"these are the standards you have to live by to maintain our best friend status\", so i walked away from that friend. I wouldnt recommend she does that, and just lets the relationship blossom naturally. If it doesnt blossom, she cant force her friend to do more.

This is something that rarely happens for me so when i get dopamine i dont want to lose it. The problem is that bombing that other person into giving you attention and therefore dopamine.....is a means to an end of that friendship. \n\nI lost a fair few budding friendships in my late teens due to this after dropping Ritalin.

But it was a tough slog when I was younger and looked for friendship in all the wrong places.", "You were very decent here to share all that info and let the ableist comment slide.

We worked together at the time. We ended up being in each other\u2019s weddings, and have raised our kids together. The friendship has now spanned almost 20 years. I don\u2019t think the age difference is weird necessarily. But the strange obsession is weird. OP is NTA for telling his completely adult daughter the truth.", "No, in the comments the OP says his daughter had a great social life till she failed her course. The daughter is desperate to hold on to the frienship now, but I don't see where you get that it was this way from the start.", "I thought of this exact line when I read the analogy. Tarkin was the bomb!", "I am not the OP, it's not my daughter. And there is a 5-year gap between \"latching on to a 16-year-old\" and \"went to an accommodation to ask why she did not wish happy birthday\". Look, the OP's 21-year-old daughter met a 16-year-old who was in the same intense sport as her and they bonded; there is nothing inherently creepy about that, and it's unfair to describe it as \"latching on\". It's more than likely that the 16-year-old was glad for the friendship of an older girl, or she wouldn't have continued the relationship for 5 years, and the daughter might have been like an older sister/mentor to her. However, it sounds as if the daughter hit a roadblock in her own life; she has to repeat her college course, her own friends have probably graduated and are now working, she finds herself back in college, an older student with limited social circle, and she is focusing on her friendship with this girl, who at best has her own life to live and doesn't want to focus on the daughter, or at worst, is over their friendship and has moved on. I think this was a nice friendship that has gone bad, it happens, there is no reason to go looking for creeps."]}
