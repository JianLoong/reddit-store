If he and his second wife had been more respectful of his first wife and kids from his first marriage, I suspect your resources would\u2019ve been more evenly split between both families.

This isn't much different from what drives people up the wall about child support.  You could perhaps wait until she loses everything and then sue for custody, but that probably isn't the way to go either and I don't know if that would necessarily work or be best for the kids.

Even once a house is paid off, you have taxes, insurance and repair which are very pricey. I don't see how you can say she will for sure be above the poverty line. It seems rather unlikely to me unless she has the help necessary to either train for some new job or else get very cheap childcare.

The OP is under no obligation to do anything for any of them, but I think it's unlikely she'll want her grandkids to grow up in a struggling household. She says she's willing to help out with the kids' expenses, so to me it seems like the best course of action to prevent future drama, protect herself, and look after the grandkids best she can is for the OP to sit down and really make a detailed plan of what specifically she is willing to do for them with very clear boundaries. Otherwise, it's going to be this drama forever with the OP doling out cash here and there and the widow using it in whatever way she sees fit and then coming back for more. All of that is going to require the OP to be in control of her emotions and not say things like she said already to the widow, whether or not they're true or justified.   \n\n\nIt would be a much easier situation if there were no children involved.", "The OP probably can help out with childcare in some way but we have no idea what the specifics of that is. But suggesting that the grandma lives nearby and is available all the time to carry out those responsibilities for years and years is really a stretch and a gigantic burden. Maybe the OP is the sort of grandma that wants to do that, but we don't know. This assumes she does not have her own career, doesn't have her own social life etc. Seems way easier for the grandma to just pay for the OP to go back to school and train for a good job than it does to spend years babysitting and driving them to and from school and extra curriculars etc just so mom can do some poverty wage job.\n\nIn truth we have no idea what this woman is willing to do, but they ought to decide on something and keep it clear, specific, transparent, etc, and then not let emotions get in the way in the future. Otherwise it's going to be some endless drama.", "I did not say that she is entitled to OP's money. I don't know what's hard about this. I feel like a lot of people on this sub act like there's some objective moral standard of the universe that enforces right and wrong consequences in some simple manner.\n\nThe fact remains that she is the single mom to OP's grand kids and OP has said that she is going to help the kids with expenses. It is also true that the woman in question, a bad person, has the same obstacles to employment as any unskilled single mother with no help even the ones that are good people. This is just an objective reality. She cannot possibly get janitorial work, she is not qualified. Perhaps there are temp agencies that supply work like that but I have never seen anything like that. I have tried to do work with temp agencies- they are usually more like staffing services and head hunters. An unskilled person can use them for things like eldercare work or very nonskilled labor like that. Perhaps she can get a job at a factory- you have no idea if such options exist. Surely she can get service industry work.\n\nIn any of these cases though, the job will not pay enough for her to pay a babysitter. So regardless of what she's entitled to or not, the question still exists- who will watch the children while she does that? Who will arrange for them to get to school on time, pick them up or meet them after school or provide after school care. Who will watch them on weekends and holidays or when they are sick etc. It's fine and well to say she's created this situation and undeserving of help, but those are moral sentiments that do not affect the reality of the two kids needing these things. Yes lots of women have to do this. If they work, they have help to do those things- either family who will do it for free or else some sort of government program. Or they just don't work and live off government assistance until the kids are older. She will have to sell her house and either move into a cheaper one and try to make that money last for maintenance, taxes, repairs, insurance, etc, or she'll have to rent. In any these cases, the family is usually very poor. Single mothers who do unskilled labor is the group in the US that is most likely to live in poverty. So sure \"lots of women\" do this.\n\nIt is unlikely the OP is going to sit back and watch that though since it affects her grand kids and has already said she's going to help. The only question is what is the least dramatic way that the OP can help in some clear and specific way that prevents the single mother from being manipulative or taking advantage. This is reality. Seems like it would be best all around for OP to help her train for some more skilled work so that she can get out of this situation. Saying the woman can just \"get a job\" and support herself and her children with no help at all is not.\n\nETA: Just reread your comment and now I'm laughing at the idea that people still think a 20/hr job would be sufficient pay to afford daycare for two kids plus living expenses. Just completely out of touch with reality.", "She's clearly a bad person but that seems pretty irrelevant to the facts of the situation which involves the OP's grandkids.   \n\n\nThe running through savings depends on what she spent it on. She's paid off her house and debts and it's been ten months. It doesn't sound like the dead husband was much of a provider if he left behind a widow, an exwife and four kids and his insurance policy did nothing more than pay off his debts and a mortgage. So I think it would be a pretty big assumption that there was much in the way of savings. Poor kids, they sound like terrible people.", "Or perhaps utilize her skill set at a daycare facility that will cover tuition for her children or use her freshly paid off house to start her own daycare business?
