I(35M) was on a holiday with my wife (32F), while returning we had an 8 hour flight ahead of us. I normally plan ahead on selecting the seats and meal plans so there's no hassle. Since we didn't have check in luggage and everything was in small carry on for both of us, we decided to skip the queue and went to the automated kiosk to to print our boarding card. When I printed it out I noticed that the seats were not the one I paid for. Moreover they separated my wife and I by 7 rows, and what's worse both were middle seats. \n\nI was confused at this point and went to the check in counter. They told me they made the switch because some couple with a small kid asked them to be seated together. I tried being civil with them by explaining that I paid for those seats and they can't just give it away, however they kept insisting that they don't have any seats to spare. \n\nSo I basically held up the line(there were only 2 counters, one was closed and I was on the other one) by saying that I'll consider those seats they allocated if they refund me the charges I paid for the seats. That caused a big argument for some reason because they said it's against some policy of theirs, this went on till the ground manager came in 20 minutes later. By that time the line was getting impatient and one guy came upto my face telling me to move, in which I told him whether he really wants to try his luck in a heavily guarded and police protected airport with so many cameras around? He backed up thankfully. The ground manager was nice and apologetic for the staffs behaviour and basically gave me a free upgrade to business class and 5 20% discount vouchers to use for next time. While stepping out of the line I could hear the murmurs and annoyanced of the passengers. What's interesting is that they still didn't have the second counter opened up to ease the passengers flow. \n\nSo WITA for asking what I think was rightfully mine?", "created_utc": 1691572589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ma2mc/aita_for_being_angry_at_the_airline_staff_for/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
