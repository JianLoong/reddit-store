If they hadn\u2019t of made the cock up in the first place, you wouldn\u2019t have needed to.", "NTA. Airline companies constantly do shit like this because they think they can get away with it. The fact that the manager was so apologetic isn't because he thinks you're in the right, but because he saw that their first response of trying to deny you your rights didn't work, so he had to \"show belly\" in order to appease you and avoid having to \\*actually\\* offer proper repair for your trouble.  \n\n\nBet you he started shit-talking you the moment you weren't in ear-range anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the other customers in this situation are 100% the AH too because when that kind of shit happens, you don't get mad at the person who's rightfully asking for the company to fix their mistake. You get mad at the company for trying to scam a customer, and thus creating a bigger line because they're now taking so long to fix an issue that should be repaired in under 1 minute. You give seats away, the ACTUAL \"owner\" of those seats comes up and tells you \"No, these are my seats\", you go \"okay\" and fucking give their seats back. That family with a young kid is at fault for not reserving proper seats sooner.", "Airlines have a staffing problem. \n\nThey refuse to pay decently and therefore are understaffed. \n\nThey also seem to have a training problem since their untrained agents stupidly gave away reserved seats just because someone with a child asked for it. \n\nNone of which is your fault. \n\nAs for the passenger upset by the line, well he seems to have poor organisation skills and a planning problem. 20 extra minutes shouldn\u2019t really make a big difference or make anyone violent unless they\u2019ve planned very poorly. \n\nBut neither of those are a you problem.", "Definitely NTA, this happened to my mum and auntie when they went away, they'd paid for seats and were forced to move due to a family with children. \n\nI understand people want to travel with children, but if they want to sit together they should book seats like everybody else. I travel with my son and always book seats as I'd get frustrated in the same situation.\n\nPeople shouldn't just assume they can get seats together.", "NTA!!! This happened to me recently but we were 10 minutes into a 1 hour flight and the stewardess tried to strong-arm me into giving one of our three seats to their friend (also staff but not working that route).\n\nThe guy had gotten on last minute for free, on a 100% packed high-season flight, and they wanted to bully a couple with a 6 month old baby into giving up the third \"free\" seat that I paid for so we could not bother and be un-bothered by others as much as possible. Funny thing is that the airline literally advertises and encourages people to buy an extra seat for \"peace of mind and comfort\" so it's not as if I was exploiting some loophole here. People are shameless.", "NTA. They took your money for service and attempted to not provide that service, which is what held up the line.", "We always pay for our seats as we like to be together but on the aisle.

You'd paid an additional fee to get specific seats, the fact they then decided to re-assign your seat means you should have been refunded it.

I always buy extra legroom seats because I'm tall. The few times I've been asked to \"offer\" my seat to someone else i always said. \"No problem. Can you refund me for the seat?\" They don't so i stay. To clarify this has been on UK budget airlines. The seating is always messed up.", "NTA. The other family failed to plan properly, and the airline treated you as if you caused the problem, not the airline. An understaffed check-in counter is not your fault either.

I would've been pissed too if I paid extra for my seats and they just gave them away and then decided that their policy didn't allow me a refund. That is some grand BS right there.

If they gave my seat away I'd raise hell too.", "I booked seats with my two kids and was \u201ctold\u201d that I had to book a parent/adult with the two kids.

I've known lots of Frontline staff however for various airlines and I can tell you that a gate agents ability or willingness to make accommodations is very much based on how they are treated. I'm thinking you had the issues you had because they definitely wanted you to feel the pressure to give up and leave. And they might have tried to twist the knife a bit if you came at them as anything other than polite. \n\nIt was actually really smart of them to get you in an argument. All the people behind you see is just another whiny airline passenger that won't shut up so they can get where they are going.

Check out Erica, the lawyer that reads the fine print so you don\u2019t have to.", "JAM (justifiable asshole move). \n\nHolding up the queue so you can argue definitely ruined other peoples' days. But the airline messed you around and decided to  open only two counters. \n\nSometimes being confrontational is the right thing to do, which is what you did here.

First the people behind the check-in desk don't work for the airline, they work for the ground handler, who the airline contracts to do the work for them.  The people behind the desk were the worst people to moan at here.\n\nSecond, airlines bump people constantly, so they're well within their rights to give your seat to someone else and you'll have even accepted that condition when you booked your ticket.

It appears I'm the only one saying this, so I'll most likely be down voted to end all down votes. But you stood at the counter for over 20 minutes demanding a refund? How much extra did you pay for the seats? If we're talking $10 a seat, then what you subjected the ground staff to is unacceptable behaviour. You think they don't have enough passengers angrily arguing with them at any time of day? About when the weather's going to change, who they're sitting next to or whether their bag is too big for carry on?! Those shows on TV with the people shouting and acting all crazy is totally the norm for anyone who works for an airline. I worked for one for 10 years. I saw a colleague get punched once got not doing what the passenger wanted them to do. Everyone on that flight, unless they're travelling with someone else, wants an aisle or window seat, up the front, so they can board last and be off first. If the flight wasn't a long haul one, you just have to suck it up, you're not travelling private. And I'm betting more than half those with only carry on, their bags were over weight. And it's not guaranteed it'll be your head your bag falls on, damaging your neck either. I very much doubt you were being polite and keeping your voice down when you were asking for your refund or to be given your original seats either, the manager would have sorted you out because you were most likely loud and obnoxious, and obviously holding up other passengers.

You'll still end up in the same plane, flying to the same destination, who cares...get over it and move along, I'm tired of standing here, etc.\n\nThen...I looked at it from OP's perspective, and there's *no way* I would've shut up about it until they remedied it (if it were me), which is a pretty damned entitled way of thinking!  It's okay for me, but not other people? That's not typically how my brain works, yet it did this time...my bad!\n\nIf the airline would've had their poop in a group, it wouldn't have happened.

I was not pleased and made a bit of a fuss trying to fix the broken blind myself.  But I was far less courageous than OP and in the end just let it go.
