The fact that the manager was so apologetic isn't because he thinks you're in the right, but because he saw that their first response of trying to deny you your rights didn't work, so he had to \"show belly\" in order to appease you and avoid having to \\*actually\\* offer proper repair for your trouble.  \n\n\nBet you he started shit-talking you the moment you weren't in ear-range anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the other customers in this situation are 100% the AH too because when that kind of shit happens, you don't get mad at the person who's rightfully asking for the company to fix their mistake.

Funny thing is that the airline literally advertises and encourages people to buy an extra seat for \"peace of mind and comfort\" so it's not as if I was exploiting some loophole here.

I always buy extra legroom seats because I'm tall. The few times I've been asked to \"offer\" my seat to someone else i always said. \"No problem. Can you refund me for the seat?\" They don't so i stay. To clarify this has been on UK budget airlines. The seating is always messed up.", "NTA. The other family failed to plan properly, and the airline treated you as if you caused the problem, not the airline. An understaffed check-in counter is not your fault either.

I've known lots of Frontline staff however for various airlines and I can tell you that a gate agents ability or willingness to make accommodations is very much based on how they are treated. I'm thinking you had the issues you had because they definitely wanted you to feel the pressure to give up and leave.

But they would have had the option to call ahead of time and arrange it over the phone. Though I did see a different comment from someone saying they tried this and was told it would be resolved at the gate. It could differ from airline to airline", "United at my local airport does not have a single member of ground staff ;)  So you saying they have staff from the ramp to the pilot \"isn't close to being right\" :D\n\nIn fact, every airline at my local airport, including this country's flagship airline, is handled by a ground handler.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>but to say all floor agents are 3rd party isnt close to being right\n\nIf only I could have rolled my eyes harder.  Jesus Christ.", "What tossers lol", "So you are making things up then?\n\nLet's try an analogy. You are grocery shopping, have paid for your food, are pushing your trolley out of the shop and an employee takes the trolley off you. All of a sudden you have paid for the food, but you don't have it because of something the store has done. Would you find a member of staff and complain and not give up until you either got what you paid for or got a refund, or would you just waltz out happy as day like you seem to expect OP to have done in their situation?", "Tell that to Custer.", "I know what a reservation is sir!   \n\n\nI don\u2019t think you do!", "R/woosh", "Really? Which episode?? \ud83d\ude44", "Exactly. I always pay extra for an aisle seat because I like the aisle. If I'm asked to move, it had better be to another aisle because otherwise I'm not going to.", "You're right, but that's why double booking is indeed unfair to each passenger who pay for prebooking", "that happened to a colleague of mine on a flight from nyc to cancun. the airline had overbooked the flight, and the flight was being held up in an attempt to get someone to give up their seat in return for a voucher etc. obviously everyone was on their way to a vacation, and since this was a late afternoon flight, by giving up their seat, chances are the airline wouldn't be able to get them to cancun til the following day, which means whatever $ they'd spent on their cancun hotel for that night would be wasted (not to mention having to travel back into the city only to have to return to the airport the following day). it just clearly wasn't worth it for anyone. so no one budged, despite the pleas from the cabin crew.\n\nfinally for some godforsaken reason they decided to just pick someone at random & it was my colleague. she tried to argue that she shouldn't be forced to give up her seat, listing all the extra expenses she would have to incur because of the airline's overbooking policy etc, but it fell on deaf ears. their 'solution' to her transportation costs were that they offered to put her up at one of the airport hotels for the night (because you know, spending the evening in a hotel at JFK smelling jet fuel & drinking from an overpriced minibar is comparable to sitting poolside in cancun, enjoying nightime ocean breezes while sipping a margarita). i could never begin to figure out why the airline felt the person who arrived to the airport later than everyone else was somehow more worthy of that seat. PLUS they had to retrieve her already stored luggage, which further inconvenienced all the passengers lucky enough to be allowed to remain on the flight they paid for (!), so they all had to sit on the tarmac for however long that took.\n\ni mean, i get that it sucks for the person arriving later to find out there was no seat available for them bc of overbooking, but how on earth does it make sense to screw over a passenger who arrived earlier AND all the others wanting to take off at the scheduled time?!\n\nand i know this happens often enough that it's not that these late arrivals are all VIPs. it's just some ridiculous policy the airlines decided makes sense.", "What would happen in the case of an overbooked flight and not enough volunteers to catch a later flight, when they start forcefully removing people, if they select someone who had restrictions on their transit? \n\nTalking about a close call I actually had years ago (close because enough volunteers stepped forward and no one was forced off the flight), where I was transitting, my passport allowed me up to 24 hours transit provided it didn't cross into the next calendar day and of course not leaving the secure part of the airport. Next day flight, staying at a hotel near the airport, any of that would've required a full visa : which can take weeks to be granted and costs money! Could they force someone in that situation off the flight in the first place?? And if they can, would they have to arrange the required visa first?? Or would it be a case of \"not the airline's problem, tough luck!\"?\n\nPure curiosity at this point as I've since naturalised in my new country and my new passport is amazing for visa free travel! But that was the most stressful transit I've ever been through, I was petrified of getting into trouble on my first ever international flight through no fault of my own (I made sure to book in such a way that I'd be safe even if there were a few hours delay)", ">  In those times, I wonder what power the late person has.\n\nThe power of $$$ and/or a frequent flyer.", "Another perfect example of it not necessarily being due to a family's lack of planning.", "We have a law for that already. It\u2019s called fraud, it also is never enforced against big companies.", "Because OP was making the assumption that the parents didn't plan ahead when it could possible be the parents had been in the exact same situation as OP.", "Everyone else was also working off the info we have here, too - but without going off into a side of the story we don't have, which is what you were doing.", "Oh, for sure. But I try to think the best of individuals (and the worst of corporations, heh) until they give me reason to think otherwise. Not because I'm trying to be saintly or anything, it's just better for my blood pressure lol", "'What if the situation was entirely different, would you behave differently?'", "Damn. Bravo.", "I read this whole exchange with Jerry's voice.", "I just wasn't sure it was the correct reference. As I don't get all the pop culture references, I figured it was worth the check.", "Yeah, what happened to your colleague is both unfair and stupid. \n\nBUT I do understand them at least *asking* if anyone\u2019s prepared to give up their seat (even if this delays the flight a bit). They should never compel someone though. \n\nI was actually in this situation and volunteered! The passenger they needed to board was on their way to a family funeral. I, on the other hand, was a starving phd student on my way to give a paper at a conference (flights paid for by my research funding, but nothing else). I was flying out a day before the conference to give myself time to climatise, but getting the following flight the next day would have meant I\u2019d still be on time. I was booked into a shitty youth hostel at my destination, in a shared dorm; and was looking at a supper of super noodles. The airline offered a king sized room in a pretty fancy airport hotel (by my standards at the time lol), plus up to \u00a3200 on account for hotel food and drink. So I lived like a lord for the night and tbh for me that was a pretty sweet deal! So I get why they *ask*.", "Which is also not the problem of the OP.", "Ahh yea I do get all of this. But as ive said before im just not arguing on the side of people who's info we don't have", "I mean they overbook as a matter of course... they routinely sell the same seat twice. I can imagine them both having paid for the same seat.", "Exactly. Im not saying anyones arguments are wrong in the slightest im just enjoying the debate", "How is it entirely different? OP paid for something, the company took that thing away and refuses to refund what OP paid. The concept is the damn same.", "Agreed", "Overbooking is a BS term. It should be called what it is, fraud", "They pre-ordered an extra that was no longer available. They were offered a less good but viable alternative. They can then claim back the difference in cost later. \n\nYour scenario would be equivalent to being evicted from the plane.", ">They pre-ordered an extra that was no longer available.\n\nThey paid for a product that the airline then decided to give away to someone else.\n\n>They can then claim back the difference in cost later.\n\nGiven the trouble OP had in front of actual staff, there is no way in hell if I was in OP's shoes I'd trust that would actually work out in my favour. The airline gave away what OP paid for so they need to refund him, simple as that."]}
