I love her to death, but her addiction was making things in both of our lives very hard, so I\u2019m very proud of her for finally working up the resolve to get our lives back. Since then, we have both avoided alcohol like it\u2019s cyanide. \n\nOn to the issue: \n\nEvery year, my parents throw a blowout anniversary party. They have more money than they know what to do with, and hospitality is both of their passions, so needless to say it\u2019s a huge deal in my family. Unfortunately, my family are a bunch of rowdy drunks and there is enough alcohol at those parties to drown a small city.\n\nLast year, my girlfriend got way too drunk and got in a screaming match with my cousin and has since been pretty alienated from my family. She\u2019s confessed to me that that incident was one of the reasons she decided to quit, but that it took time to work up the willpower to actually go through with it.\n\nAbout two weeks before the party, I contacted my parents to let them know that my girlfriend and I would not be attending because of my girlfriend\u2019s recovery. They told me that they were sad about my girlfriend\u2019s absence but that they understood, but expressed confusion as to why I couldn\u2019t come. I explained that I wanted to stay home and support her. My parents sounded annoyed but accepted my decision. \n\nA couple days later, my sister texted me and accused me of choosing my girlfriend over my family. She said that my dad probably doesn\u2019t have long to live (he has diabetes, heart issues, and autoimmune disease, but he\u2019s not on his death bed by any means) and that I\u2019m being selfish because I\u2019m helping my girlfriend \u201cwallow in self pity instead of  helping her face her mistakes and own up to our family\u201d. Various other family members have reached out and expressed similar sentiments, and my girlfriend has even said that she\u2019d be fine with me going. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the only one holding out on this, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m being overly stubborn.

If yr GF is fine w/you going, why don't you go? You don't give any indication that she needs the \"support\" you'd give her by staying home. There's nothing wrong with you going.\n\nHave to say yr sister's comments aren't helpful though. Doesn't sound like GF will be \"wallowing in self pity.\" She just doesn't want to be around alcohol. Nothing wrong with that.", "YTA,\n\nIt's great that you're supporting your girlfriend, but that doesn't mean that you can't go to your parents anniversary party. You can support your fam and your gf, plus your gf even said you should go. \n\nI don't understand your logic of not going. \n\nOn one hand if you don't go you will have lots of family disappointed and be losing our in memories with your parents, especially with your dad not doing so well.\n\nIf you do go, no one will be mad or hurt or triggered.\n\nThe solution seems very logical to me that you should go", "YTA. You\u2019re not helping your gf by doing this. You\u2019ve crossed the line between supporting her and carrying some of the weight of her recovery. Supporting her would be not giving her a hard time about not going to the party. By not going to a family event and getting into rift with your family because of it, you\u2019re taking on some of the responsibility for her addiction. She\u2019s not going to fully overcome the the addiction if you keep doing that.", "YTA \n\nI don't think you should skip your parents anniversary. Life doesn't last forever. Is there someone your gf can hangout with on the night of the event?", "YTA. She said go. You should go", "YTA. You can be supportive of your girlfriend and still attend your parents\u2019 anniversary party. It\u2019s completely understandable that she doesn\u2019t want to go. But there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t go. And you absolutely should.", "YTA, I don't understand what your problem is. You have to be with your girlfriend 24/7to keep her sober? If thats the case go NC with all your drinking relatives to avoid this kind of issues from happening again.", "INFO: do you actually want to go to the party, or are you using this as a reason to not go?", "Just go to the party and dont drink. That way when you arrive home you dont smell alcohol. Then have a brunch without alcohol with your parents and gf", "NTA but if your GF said you could go, *and you want to go* then go. If you really don't want to go and it's not just because of your GF then don't go but don't use your GF as the excuse especially since there's already friction between her and your family.", "YTA your girlfriend can spend the evening with friends or watching tv alone or whatever she wants to do and you can spend time with your parents.  \n\nYou don't have to stay late, but you should at least go for a short while.  You can leave when everyone starts getting drunk.", "YTA go to your parents\u2019 anniversary party.", "YTA, I don't see why you can't go. I'm sure your GF is fine without you for a night, unless you spend every wakening moment with her as it is. Don't really see what your being stubborn about either...", "NAH. You don\u2019t have to go but I understand why your family is upset not to see you. If your gf is fine with you going, why wouldn\u2019t you just go? You can leave when it starts to get rowdy but still show up for your parents", "YTA. Her alcoholism is not your problem! She made a fool of herself and now you have to suffer?", "I'd say NTA. We can give advice on if you should go or shouldn't go all we want, but we don't know your girlfriend. We don't know if she's at risk for relapsing if you're not there with her, only you can say that. If you think she'll be fine, just go and if you're not sure, maybe you can find an activity for her to do (maybe she could babysit) or someone responsible to be with her just in case (a friend, family, etc.) or just stay with her.\n\nHowever, I think you should be really clear with your sister and family members that your gf  in recovery for her addiction *because* she's owning up to her mistake, tell them that she has been sober for 6 months *because* she's owning up to her mistake, tell them that she's not coming *because* she's owning up to her mistake. Her not going is not \"her wallowing in self pity\", it's her owning up to her mistake and trying to fix it by recovering from an addiction. She is sick and right now she is recovering because she's owning up to it.\n\nI wish you and your gf the best!", "ESH, soft asshole for you though. You sound like a really thoughtful person, but the simple solution is just to go without her. She even said you should go. It\u2019s one night.\n\nYour sister on the hand sounds pretty vile.  I\u2019d bet money that your sister is spinning some exaggerated story to your family members. \n\nESH except your girlfriend of course", "Nta; it sounds like you\u2019re a good boyfriend - maybe you can both take them out for lunch or something nearer the anniversary instead", "NTA..... You SHOULD pick your gf over your family  \nand its not like you cut them out of your life its you dont want to be around so much alcohol.\n\nyour sister is a Big Asshole though.  \nIf your dad doesnt have much time visit him without alcohol.", "YTA. Why are you punishing your parents for your GF\u2019s alcoholism?\n\nYour GF is not yet in a position in her recovery to be at a party with alcohol so is staying away. That\u2019s incredibly appropriate and shows she is taking her recovery seriously. \n\nBut you are not showing support by no longer socialising with your family. This event is important to your parents. You are not an alcoholic needing to stay away from alcohol. There is literally no reason for you to decline the invite. If you are worried about the impact of coming home smelling of alcohol - stay the night away or do not drink yourself. \n\nYou are also doing your GF a disservice. Last party her driving caused problems for your family. This year her drinking is causing problems for your family. They will see this as her fault. If she wasn\u2019t an alcoholic you\u2019d still be at family events - but she is an alcoholic so you no longer come. \n\nWhat is your plan for the next social event where alcohol is served? Or work function? Or outing with friends? Are you planning to cut yourself off from everything for the next few years until your GF can take part in such things again?", "Have to admit I\u2019m stunned by those saying you\u2019re TA. It\u2019s only been 6 months for your GF of being sober, and this event was a major one in her journey of recovery, and therefore will probably be very triggering for her. Of course she\u2019s telling you she wants you to go. What else is she suppose to say? Ffs, people, she\u2019s trying to do the right thing for her BF, but he\u2019s also trying to do the right thing for her. OP said his dad isn\u2019t on death\u2019s door, and the suggestion of the 2 of them taking the parents out for lunch or dinner on their own would be a way better idea, for all of them. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s cutting them out of his life!!!\nOP, absolutely NTA! You\u2019re being very supportive of your GF at a very difficult and vulnerable time for her. Good luck to both of you!", "YTA\n\nYou staying home and avoiding your family isn\u2019t supporting your girlfriend\u2019s sobriety. It\u2019s just an excuse to avoid them.\n\nShe said to go, and your family would like you to attend.", "YTA\n\nthe anniversary seems to be important to your parents and family. your girlfriend seems to be fine with being alone during the party. what's your reason for not going there alone? it's not like you don't know anybody there...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to go to your parents anniversary party are you serious. And your girlfriend NEEDS to be there too. If you guys can\u2019t even tackle a family party with alcohol what are you guys going to do when a real problem comes. Rise to the \u201cchallenge\u201d and go celebrate the people who conceived you. I\u2019m also confused how you think this relationship will last if your GF never fixes her relationship with your family. Go there, drink water with your girlfriend and try to have fun. Don\u2019t get offended by anything. Don\u2019t accept any alcohol. If you two go there and genuinely celebrate the anniversary, which you should because staying married that long is getting rarer and rarer, your life will be so much better. You and your gf should strive to be what your parents are. Rich and in love. Text your sister. Own up and apologize and say that of course you\u2019ll be there. Good on you if you can do that. Good luck", "YGTA, your girlfriend is the asshole.  The expectation that you must micro manage her sobriety is unhealthy and codependent.  You are being alienated from your family and hiding.  Many things in life involve drinking, will you excuse yourselves forever... or just this in particular.\n\nTo me, your excusing yourselves out of shame.  You should be with your family, there's drinking everywhere.

She\u2019s a grown adult who told him he should go too. If she can\u2019t manage a few days without him without drinking what would happen if he needed to travel for work, or leave for an emergency?

I don\u2019t even know what point you\u2019re trying to make.

Sounds worse than clubbing to me for someone who is trying to stay sober\u2026\nYeah, their anniversary is once a year, thanks for the math lesson.  OP and GF can celebrate that  with them alone, at dinner or lunch on another day.  Why does it have to be at a drunken party when GF is only 6 months sober??

She\u2019s confessed to me that that incident was one of the reasons she decided to quit,\n\nIt clearly stated she is in no way expressing concern or disturbance about the OP family being alcoholic people. She wanted to keep peace, but OP says otherwise. \n\nThe alienated part probably because girlfriend gone way too far but hey, rowdy drunks family. \ud83d\ude44", "Also gf clearly says op ALLOWED to go to the party.\n\nAnd op doesnt have to get drunk to attend, just make face and be done. It could be as an ANOTHER effort to support gf.  \"Hey im not touching those alcohol, only my family does as usual.\""]}
