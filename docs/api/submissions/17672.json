Before they had booked anything, I told them I would not attend a ceremony at a church, but that I would still attend the reception (which is not at a church) or if they wanted to move the ceremony to a non-religious venue, I would be happy to attend the ceremony.  They have since moved the ceremony to a new location than they originally planned, but the new location is also a Catholic Church.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I was forced to go to church on Sunday every single week, along with all holy days until I moved away for college (18).  I was also forced to go to religious education classes every single week until I was 14.  This was despite me making it very clear to my parents that I did not want to attend either, yet my mother repeatedly told me that I had to obey her wishes and attend church because \u201cI am the child, and she is the adult\u201d.  As a child, I was punished many times for resisting going to church.  I also refused to receive the sacrament of Confirmation as it represented something I did not believe in.\n\nEven as a young teenager, I knew that Catholicism did not align with my beliefs.  Over time I evolved my beliefs evolved to Atheism and an active dislike for religion.  I do not want to support the Catholic Church in any way.  I am also gay, which the Catholic Church tends to look dimly on.  I have not been in a Catholic church in almost 20 years and have not been in any church for about 18 years.  My goal is to never set foot in another church for the rest of my life.  Religion brings back bad memories for me, and I don\u2019t wish to trigger myself that way by going to a church.\n\nI have tried to consider if my behavior would be different if it were friends getting married and not my parents.  I think my refusal to go would still be the same if the venue was a Catholic Church.  That said, most of my friends, and the area I now live in general, are largely non-religious, so I think it\u2019s unlikely that scenario will ever happen.\r\n\nAITA for refusing to attend their wedding vow renewal ceremony because it\u2019s at a Catholic Church?

Sometimes entering religious spaces when that religion caused you to lose your agency growing up can re-ignite some really negative feelings.

It doesn't sound like you have the best relationship with them, so have a think now about what relationship you want. Do you want to build bridges?

And I have been to weddings and stuff at ultra conservative churches (I try to avoid them at all costs). As I can suck it up for that time period.  \n\nBut there is something else when you who are is also not accepted. You are pushed out just by being yourself. F that- do whatever. Your parents seem aware enough to know what you are doing. Show up to the reception dressed to the nices with a nice gift.

Going to a ceremony in a church isn\u2019t you accepting the religion, it isn\u2019t you saying you believe in it, it isn\u2019t you saying you agree with the religion, it\u2019s supporting family. Now if you hate your family for some legitimate reason cool don\u2019t go, why we even having this discussion. Do you plan on skipping your parents funerals? Friends weddings in churches? How about a local flea market in a church basement?", "NTA. The other opinions clearly don't understand the trauma of growing up queer in a Catholic home", "In case you missed it, it\u2019s about them & their beliefs\u2026", "INFO\n\nWould you refuse to go to a church if it was your best friend getting married? Or is this more about your parents?", "YTA - I'm queer, I don't go to church or mosque, I was raised Muslim and made to attend private Catholic school. I'm not worshipping in any respect, but going to an event that is important to someone, or here, your parents, should take precedence. I've gone to various different weddings of various faiths, I don't believe in any of it. You're not gonna burst into flames cuz you went into a church once to watch your parents vow renewal.", "NTA. The church hates you for who and what you are. I wouldn't want to be in a place like that either.", "YTA. You can have your own beliefs but like seriously how does entering the Church physically make you Christian again? Please don't turn things down because it only invalidates you that is not even your day.", "YTA. You talked a WHOLE lot about yourself, and said very little about your parents.  This ceremony ISNT ABOUT YOU.   If you can't put someone else's needs and feelings ahead of your own, FOR AN AFTERNOON, than you are an incredibly selfish and narcissist person.   I don't even know you, but I'm ashamed of your behavior.", "NTA. Same here with the whole you\u2019re going to church shit with my parents. I didn\u2019t even know I could refuse to do my confirmation until the next day. I was totally conned into it. I also HAD to attend a Catholic school from kindergarten to HS graduation.", "NTA you stated what you are willing and not do.  Religious trauma is a thing", "YTA, it is for your parents, not you!", "I can\u2019t *believe* there are Y T A votes. Your parents chose the venue knowing that you wouldn\u2019t attend. You\u2019re planning to come celebrate with them at the reception, which is great. Are they giving you any kind of a hard time about not attending? If so, NTA. Otherwise NAH.\n\nGiven your past trauma, it\u2019s perfectly understandable that you don\u2019t want to sit through a Catholic mass ever again, and no one should expect you to. It\u2019s definitely not an essential part of life that you\u2019re missing out on! \n\nIf you eventually process the trauma, and an event in a church comes up where it\u2019s important and you feel comfortable enough to go, then you can go. That isn\u2019t the case right now.", "Especially since OP is gay and catholicism says how he was born is a sin", "The ppl saying to just be there for the parents make me sick. There are people who grew up traumatized by their parents and keep in touch with them just for the sake of it. Just BC they are blood , doesn't mean you have to drop everything and do it for them.\nThe parents chose for you to be born and raised you how THEY saw fit and everybody loses their shit when you say you don't wanna do smth for your parents.", "I actually did say that.  I said something along the lines of \"growing up, you made me go to church and you said I had to go because I was the child and you're the adult.  I'm the adult now, and I'm not going to church\"", "Louder for the people voting Y T A! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "it\u2019s unreasonable to expect them to change a *whole venue* for one person, which is why I think OP is TA.", "This is perfectly stated. There's no AH but from the way it's written, I would guess OP is in early twenties and *just* came out as gay and atheist. I understand that it opens old wounds, but maybe it's time to disinfect them them and stitch them properly with therapists. This can cause huge rift in the family and it will take further toll on OP, no matter what they decide to do.", "Why go to the party if the ceremony is ridiculous?", "Truthfully, I think it's some of both.  When I'm bored/alone in my own thoughts, which a situation like this will be (my mind will be racing during something like this) I tend to end up only focusing on bad things.  And physically being there will almost certainly remind me of the negativity it's had in my life.  That said, there is likely a grudge factor also.", "I'm an atheist, brought up Catholic and I don't think she should feel obligated to go to the ceremony. The church is very hard against women and gay people.", "That's a hard question to answer.  I do have a relationship with them, but it is strained at times (recently they have been straining it to the point I'm \"barely\" speaking with them, unrelated to their vow renewal).  I feel it's less close than most of my friends have with their parents, but I also know some people who are worse there.", "Not yet, but I currently working on finding a therapist (for things in general, not just this)", "No big deal TO YOU. This man clearly has trauma related to the church and it\u2019s disgusting you\u2019re only thinking about how you would feel. By your logic, a veteran with PTSD who doesn\u2019t want to go to a family firework party is just as big an AH as OP. He\u2019s not obligated to put his mental health at risk for anyone, ESPECIALLY not for the people that caused the trauma in the first place!", "My thoughts exactly. \n\nYTA an enormous one.", "> it\u2019s not about you\n\nThen there is no need for OP to be there.", "Then why should OP be there then? It shouldn't matter then", "I responded without reading others comments and just realized we basically responded the same way. This person can deal for a few moments for their parents without making it all about them.", "His parents didn't give a shit about him when he was a child. Forcing religion on someone is a kind of abuse. He has every right to stay away. His parents can be happy he keeps contact despite of their behavior when he was a child.", "I think that would actually be worse from a \"being the asshole\" standpoint.  If I'm not participating, I'm not doing the Sit-Stand-Sit-Kneel-Stand-Sit-Whatever dance that Catholic churches do during the mass, so I think that would draw more attention to myself.  \nI do not believe that there are any bridesmaids/groomsmen in the ceremony.  If they are, I was not asked to be one.", "> cooties\n\nThat is a   condescending and insensitive way of dismissing the distress that Catholic church has caused OP. A church that says he should burn for eternity for his very nature.", "He's gay. By proxy, he's experienced abuse by the church simply from dealing with the hatred perpetuated by the institution. And forcing a child to go along with your religious beliefs with threats of punishment is also a form of abuse.\n\nI'm going with NAH. OP is not an AH for not wanting anything to do with a church, and the parents are not AHs for wanting to celebrate in a church. I think going to the reception is a good compromise.", "The two catholic weddings I\u2019ve been to included a full mass. People lined up and took communion. It\u2019s a religious service, that\u2019s why it\u2019s in a church.", "> It\u2019s not about religion\n\nthen why is it in a church?", "A wedding ceremony at a churchis a religious service\u2026..", "It is my understanding that there is a full catholic mass wrapped around it", "This isn\u2019t a wedding.  It is a play wedding", " > Entering it does not connote a rousing support of Catholicism.\n\nI can't agree. It is tacit support. If someone \"just sits in\" on a KKK rally, for example, they are effectively offering my support. This is no different. THAT is (IMHO) why it matters.", "The church does not fully welcome gays.  No way.", "I think it's pretty clear from the story that OPs parents aren't the open and accepting kind of catholics.", "Then let that be an end of the discussion.", "Good answer.", "Well, then they need to accept the fact that op won't be there.", "OP didn\u2019t. He simply said \u201cif you have it in a church, I will not be there, but I will come to the reception.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not dictating, that\u2019s RSVPing. \n\nCatholic wedding ceremonies are so obnoxious. They\u2019re forever long. If there\u2019s the little smoke things they shake around, it\u2019s so hard to breathe. I almost had to leave my uncle\u2019s funeral service because I was having such a hard time breathing with those things.\n\nNo one is ever going to be an AH for not going to a religious ceremony or event.\n\nNTA", "So the hell with it, don't go, don't put yourself through that. \n\nI also predict that merely attending  and going through the motions will not satisfy them and may even infuriate them (\"Why you not take communion? Why are you still being so childish about it?\").\n\n--\n\nMy gut reaction reading your title was : suck it up for their sake. (And I speak as an atheist who wants to see he Catholic church destroyed and all  priests imprisoned.) But no. THEY created the situation whereby you hate the church. If you don't attend, that's their fault.  \n\nI would also suggest that the mere act of attending a  Catholic church service is implied approval of their many heinous acts.  \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d", "This is fairly important information that would give the situation more context.", "Then there is no need for guests at weddings. This is just that, a wedding. He isn't being ordained as a priest for attending.", "That's not how a celebration works.", "The person can, but does it make them an asshole for not doing so?  Nope.  No reason for him to be there for parents that shamed him, forced him to follow their magic sky fairy, and probably gave him religious trama as well.  Would you say the child of someone whose parents abused them should go to this kind of ceremony?", "We are going to have to disagree with them \"treating him like shit.\" It sucks that he was forced to go to church but that doesn't mean they didn't give a shit about him.", "For a vow renewal? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how that works. \n\nAnd even if it was, you could stand off to the side to not participate.", "Cooties is a funny way to put it though.    And how long are we going to hold onto our childhood traumas?   Don't want to support the church because they believe sinners go to hell? Just don't put money in the collection plate.      OP could support their parents and not support the church at the same time.   \n\nOP deserves life a life free and healed from childhood traumas, should be able to walk into any space without feeling endangered.  It's catholic church in a free country, there will not be a real threat there, OP's nerves shouldn't be reacting as though there is.    \n\nOP has to work passed it because it only hurts OP.", "You're misrepresenting church teaching. It's the acts that are the sin, not his nature.\n\nThe church hasn't caused OP any distress; most of his narrative was his anger at his parents making him participate in their religion with one comment about church teaching; it's really a moot point because the church did nothing to him.", "That's what I'd expect. That's a hard no.\n\nPeople are parrotting \"It's not about you!\"  \u2014 ok, sure, so it's not about you. So you don't need to be there then.", "Aside from you personal reasons, this alone would make me not want to go. I've been to a couple full catholic mass weddings and they take forever to get through", "So?", "Physically entering a church is not tacit support. Think about how many churches are used for polling stations, disaster relief, shelter during inclement weather, or community events that are 100% secular. I can totally understand attending religious events there, but churches are just buildings.", "Mine does", "Then why is OP still in contact with them. Just go NC", "Absolutely true. \n\nBut I wanted guests at mine, so I did not choose a venue that wants some of my guests to burn in hell for their sexuality, I did not choose a venue that had traumatised some of my guests.", "I don't think making a kid go to church is abuse. I was made to go to church when I didn't want to and can still step into a church for people I care about. They are not asking their child to convert, they are asking them to attend a vow renewal. They won't melt if they are there for their parents for what will probably be less than an hour.", "Where does it say his parents shamed him? Also, it\u2019s a magic sky fair to you, but to them it\u2019s real. Every parent has the right to raise their child in their own belief system.  Yes, it makes him an asshole. It\u2019s just a building.", "It wasn't about \"going somewhere\" he didn't want to. It's about forcing religion. Does freedom of religion ring a bell?", ">  It's the acts that are the sin, not his nature.\n\nSorry, my bad, you are absolutely correct. I should have said that the church wants him to burn in hell for *acting in accordance* with his nature.  Which from OP's POV is effectively the same, unless he is to remain abstinent.\n\n>The church hasn't caused OP any distress; most of his narrative was his anger at his parents making him participate in their religion with one comment about church teaching\n\nAgain, this kind of jesuitical hair-splitting may be technically correct, the outcome was the same: a life-long anxiety and distress when confronted with the Church.", "Tbh I feel like someone made a ton of alt accounts just to spam \u201cIts not about you\u201d. Like damn, all of them are pretty much the same", "The post I replied to literally said \"it's not a religious service or worship\" and I pointed out that it is actually a religious service - that is what catholic mass is."]}
