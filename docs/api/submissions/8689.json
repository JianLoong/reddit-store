Move out.", "NTA (close to ESH)\n\nIt's a copout to basically give the \"well it's their house it's their rules\" response, that gives parents a free pass to abuse their children. So I'll provide actual reasoning to this.\n\nFirstly, while they accept you living in their house, you are also entitled to privacy as long as it's not affecting them. They didn't like the idea of them staying over for the night and maybe that's something that could have been communicated earlier. That is where you are potentially in the wrong.

It's about the propriety rather than the morality, the sort of thinking that has people uptight over a man whose place of birth is a handbag in a train station even though he's rich enough and proper, because it causes a public scandal that suggests society doesn't know right from wrong. That is, it's a sin to have sex outside of marriage, so it's a greater sin to *say* that you are than it is to actually do so. And unfortunately that's more than a little gendered. When a woman goes to her home wearing the same clothes as she spent the night somewhere else in, it's called the \"walk of shame\". Not called that for a man.\n\nUnderstanding it is one thing (Edit: actually I happen to admire it, but that's because I read *The Importance of Being Earnest* in my formative years and actually took its hypocrisy seriously--most people find putting appearance over substance hypocritical). Kowtowing to it is another. It's the same sort of thinking that once discouraged women from using condoms. There's a certain point you need to stand your ground.

They knew she was there long before that and knew you were having sex. How were you supposed to predict the non-metaphorical act of sleep would be a problem?\n\nThat said, it's a moot point because now that you know their rule, you do have to follow it going forward.", "NTA. \nYour parents had plenty of time to set up this rule: \n\nWhen they first begged you to move in - that was the best opportunity, as it was the best point for you decide if you accept that rule. \n\nAt any point after - when they remembered that, when you talked about you interactions, your social life, w/e. \n\nWhen you brought the girl home, because it's very obvious that she might spend the night.

YTA.", "Still doesn't change the fact that OP is an adult and needs to get his own place if he doesn't like his parents' rules.", "thank you for this. this comment is pretty much how i saw it, and it is just a relief to know that others did too. \n\ni thought my mistake was not asking for permission for her to stay the night, but it wasn\u2019t, and since i\u2019d been told i had \u2018complete freedom\u2019 i just assumed it would be okay.", "Lol. She\u2019s a stranger to THEM (the parents) not the OP.   This comment really makes me laugh. Thanks for making my day\n\nEdit:also everyone involved are adults not children.", "Exactly. \n\nHe\u2019s paying rent. If he\u2019s old enough to pay them rent he\u2019s old enough to not be treated like a child who can\u2019t have a friend he\u2019s known for years stay over. \n\nA 49 year old calling an innocent 20 something woman a slapper is so beyond the pale of aggressive and out of order misogyny it\u2019s insane anyone is defending that behaviour. \n\nThis whole situation was wildly inappropriate and needlessly dramatic. And it\u2019s 99.9% the fault of his parents it turned into this.", "I thought this too. The \u2018I\u2019m bi\u2019 combined with the \u2018slapper\u2019 comment was confusing but he is actually male and his near 50 year old dad decided it was cool to hurl misogynistic abuse at a random young woman. \n\nThis entire situation is a big yikes.", "No he is not", "Why are so many people fine with leeching off their parents well into adulthood and expecting no consequences?", "The rules are totally dumb, and his parents are upsettingly controlling, but OP doesn\u2019t seem to be paying anything. Thus, he\u2019s not actually their tenant. He\u2019s a grown adult choosing to live there. At best he has squatters rights to his room. Therefore, their house their rules.", "I see what you mean - so OP said they were told to show respect but they didn\u2019t specify that respect meant no one sleeps overs. I now agree they could have waited until morning to have this discussion. But maybe OP could have communicated their intentions before 1AM.", "Then she should have self respect", "You raise valid points. \n\nAhh to have the energy of a 21 year old. There\u2019s not much I miss about being in my early 20\u2019s but having the energy and desire to go at it like Duracell bunnies was quite fun.", "I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s awful.", "Again she\u2019s not a stranger.", "Exactly, personal preference.", "Ohh sorry I assumed your dad was calling you a slapper but actually he was calling the other person a slapper? \n\nI mean truly I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse. It\u2019s all gross and misogynistic though and your parents behaviour was unhinged. \n\nHonestly if you can I\u2019d move out asap. Sorry your parents are behaving like this.", "They didn\u2019t communicate that \u2018boundary\u2019 till 1am. That\u2019s on them.\n\nEdit to add: he\u2019s paying rent, so he\u2019s paying for his place in the home. I guess he gets to set whatever boundaries he likes in a home he pays for then!?", "They had more then ample time to be like \"hey she can't stay the night\" before 1 AM.", ">Of course they told you complete freedom. They suck for that. \n\nDoesn't that make this ESH then? OP's parents committed to one thing, backed out on the deal and went a different direction.", "They manipulated and lied in order for him move with them. \nThey can set rules, but they need to tell them beforehand.", "His parents promised him complete freedom. \n\nHe lives in the UK. There is a housing crisis here. Rent is sky fucking high, inflation is through the roof and wages are piss fucking poor. Especially for young people. \n\nSo bizarre so many parents would rather control their adult children then make sure their adult children can have sex safely.\n\nEdit: OP is also paying rent. So he\u2019s grown up enough to pay rent but not to have a friend he\u2019s known for years sleepover. Rank hypocrisy.", "His parents need to set the rules up-front and openly, rather than improvising a new rule at 1 am whilst yelling and using misogynist slurs.", "I didn\u2019t call anyone a child. \n\nIs she a stranger to them? Do you know that?", "Idk- you\u2019re the 30 year old living with your parents rent free not me? You tell me? \n\nI\u2019ve not lived with mine properly (apart from a brief 7 month stint between 22-23) since I was 18. \n\nDuring that stint I paid rent and helped out round the house and they didn\u2019t control my sex life. Because we\u2019re all normal functioning humans who can treat each other with respect.\n\nSo weird to me other people have such dysfunctional relationships with their parents. \n\nI\u2019d hate to be all of you.", "I agree OP could have done that. \n\nYou\u2019d think that it might have been obvious before 1am what was happening. And her parents behaviour is unhinged.", "She is a stranger to the people who own the house", "yeah, he was referring to the girl hahaha. strange, as he was pretty much encouraging me with the nod and wink joke he made earlier in the night, but it\u2019s obviously a problem in his eyes for girls to have sexual freedom. quite out of character for him, but then i have been gone for 2 years now", "Uh\u2026 no\u2026 no, I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m an adult with my own home that expects people that live for free in it to follow my rules.\n\nYou guys are acting like his mom is forcing him to eat kittens. She just doesn\u2019t want to him to let a stranger sleep in her house.\n\nFFS.", "This is one of those situations where communication and clarity would have come in handy all around.", "Is she? Based on what? Where are you getting that info from. It does not say that in the post.", "Yeah I mean I don\u2019t have advice to give really. But honestly this entire situation sounds unreasonable and stressful. So I\u2019m sorry. Shouting and screaming and calling young women slappers is beyond the pale behaviour by people in their 40\u2019s. There was no need for that escalation. \n\nIf they had communicated clearly \u2018no sleepovers\u2019 before I\u2019d have a (slightly) different take. Although personally I\u2019d rather my children brought people to somewhere I know they are safe than anything else, even if as a parent it is a bit awkward. \n\nThat\u2019s just me though I guess.", "You literally said you moved back in with your parents at 30 and they said you couldn\u2019t have people over and treated you like a child. \n\nWhen I said that was weird you responded with some bizarre straw man about me freeloading and expecting no consequences. So I assumed that\u2019s how you behaved when you moved back in with your parents because otherwise it was fucking irrelevant to the point I was making. \n\nAnd the person is not a stranger. As per OP\u2019s post. It\u2019s someone he knows (I assume from school as she said he knew her for ages). At least read the post properly. Fucks sake.", "Omg.\n\nFirst of all\u2026 sometimes things happen a long time ago\u2026 it\u2019s called the progression of time. It\u2019s a real life thing.\n\nSecond of all, why are you dog piling on me? Did I offend you personally but none of the other people saying the exact same thing as me are not worth being aggressive to?\n\nTalk about a straw man argument.\n\nYou don\u2019t know these people or me and I don\u2019t know you but it sounds like you were raised to be an entitled little shit.", "I\u2019m entitled because I paid rent and helped out round the house when I lived with my parents as an adult? \n\nOr because I think it\u2019s weird when adults want to infantilise their grown children? \n\nI\u2019m not \u2018dogpiling\u2019 on you. I\u2019ve responded to plenty of other people."]}
