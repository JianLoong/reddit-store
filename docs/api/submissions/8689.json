Move out.", "NTA (close to ESH)\n\nIt's a copout to basically give the \"well it's their house it's their rules\" response, that gives parents a free pass to abuse their children. So I'll provide actual reasoning to this.\n\nFirstly, while they accept you living in their house, you are also entitled to privacy as long as it's not affecting them. They didn't like the idea of them staying over for the night and maybe that's something that could have been communicated earlier. That is where you are potentially in the wrong.

It's about the propriety rather than the morality, the sort of thinking that has people uptight over a man whose place of birth is a handbag in a train station even though he's rich enough and proper, because it causes a public scandal that suggests society doesn't know right from wrong. That is, it's a sin to have sex outside of marriage, so it's a greater sin to *say* that you are than it is to actually do so. And unfortunately that's more than a little gendered. When a woman goes to her home wearing the same clothes as she spent the night somewhere else in, it's called the \"walk of shame\". Not called that for a man.\n\nUnderstanding it is one thing (Edit: actually I happen to admire it, but that's because I read *The Importance of Being Earnest* in my formative years and actually took its hypocrisy seriously--most people find putting appearance over substance hypocritical). Kowtowing to it is another. It's the same sort of thinking that once discouraged women from using condoms. There's a certain point you need to stand your ground.

They knew she was there long before that and knew you were having sex. How were you supposed to predict the non-metaphorical act of sleep would be a problem?\n\nThat said, it's a moot point because now that you know their rule, you do have to follow it going forward.", "NTA. \nYour parents had plenty of time to set up this rule: \n\nWhen they first begged you to move in - that was the best opportunity, as it was the best point for you decide if you accept that rule. \n\nAt any point after - when they remembered that, when you talked about you interactions, your social life, w/e. \n\nWhen you brought the girl home, because it's very obvious that she might spend the night.

He\u2019s literally paying to live there. \n\nIf they don\u2019t want to treat him like a rent paying adult and human contributing to the house they can stop taking his fucking money like a pair of scamming AH\u2019s.", "That is not a normal occurrence. \n\nI don\u2019t know the circumstances of your situation but I can tell you, it\u2019s not normal.\n\nYou\u2019re more at risk from family members and friends then you are literally anyone else.", "? I honestly don't know what kind of point you're making, surely east Asian countries for example are more of doormats to their children because it's common for the whole family to live together without charging each other rent? Pretty sure the American experience these days is the kids being a doormat to society.", "My point was directed at you, but more-so the concept of ownership. Sure, you\u2019re house so you restrict yourself but the argument of \u201cjust because you own it doesn\u2019t mean you can do anything\u201d which yes it does if you own it. In your case, you choose to restrict yourself.", "Rent that\u2019s most likely discounted also him not having to renew leases, put down deposits, most likely not accounting water and other utilities. Rentoids have rules to follow by landlords.", "I assumed that bc you basically implied its ridiculous that Americans jump to no contact \"over nothing\". \n\nYou clearly haven't dealt with many toxic family members. They often don't change and they aren't sorry because there is something wrong with them emotionally/ mentally. I was saying what to do if that was the case, obviously. And by this post it sounds likely they are the type with no remorse and with serious boundary problems. Its not safe to assume these are reasonable people capable of change but I'm sure we all hope they are.", "Why? Sex isn't dirty. I come from a culture where it's common to have three generations in the same home. That doesn't mean we expect our grandparents to stop fucking lest they upset their children. Or our parents to stop fucking so they don't upset their parents. Parents having sex in a room next to their kids is not more inherently innocent than one of their kids having sex with a consenting adult in the room next to their parents.", "No, it doesn't. Even if I thought I could do anything I want, I still couldn't. Ownership does not eliminate all other morality.", "This attitude is a good way to end up with other people, particularly your grown children hating you. \n\nOwning something doesn\u2019t mean that when you behave like an unreasonable AH get a free pass because you own your house.", "Lol. Landlords famously don\u2019t allow their tenants to have sex. \n\nThey don\u2019t want to treat him like an adult- they return the money they charged him.", "It\u2019s literally not remotely disrespectful. People are too involved in other adults sex lives.", "If they hate me for not respecting my shit then whatever. I grew up with these mindsets and never hated my parents. Called good parenting and not babying your kids.", "Guess he should move out, problem solved. Don\u2019t like it, get the fuck out. How hard is that to understand?", "extremely bizarre", "Good parenting is throwing screaming temper tantrums and hurling misogynistic abuse around at 1am now? \n\nWild. Clearly you didn\u2019t read the post. Or if you did your parenting and/ or reading comprehension is piss fucking poor.", "Don\u2019t like what I\u2019m saying get the fuck of this thread. \n\nHow hard is that to understand? \n\nYou\u2019re brain dead.", "I know moving is stressful but seriously your parents called that girl a slut because you where going to go to sleep after having sex. Your parents have no respect for you or anyone you bring home. You need to move out and go LC with your parents for a while. My son lives a home and I would never embarrass him, her and myself like that. Cause let\u2019s be honest your parents are the ones who look like fools.", "NTA for many reasons. But I strongly think a second date with this young woman is very unlikely.", "NTA, stupid rules that don\u2019t follow logic are ridiculous. You should focus all of your time and energy on getting out of there as soon as possible, because this isn\u2019t going to resolve itself in a way other than them being ridiculous.", "NTA. You need to get your own place. Yes, I've moved around constantly; yes, there's a housing shortage; yes, rent's expensive. \n\nYou're an adult. Get your own place or stop bitching.", "NTA", "NTA Unfortunately while living in their home they call the shots.", "Sounds like it's right out of fantasy land.", "Sounds like your parents don't want to deal with awkward situations in the morning.   Doesn't sound that unreasonable to me.   I would put a limit on overnight guests as well if it was a roommate situation (not completely banned, but I've way to many SOs of roommates who basically just move in and as an early riser often had to interact with randos). I do agree how they dealt with the situation was bad.\n\nESH, mildly.   Get your own place if you want full autonomy.  And tell them you are displeased and they should have made this rule clear. \n If so, you would have just gotten your own place as you intended before they stuck their nose in it.", "That sounds like a weird line to draw in the sand, but it seems like they aren't comfortable with having people they don't know in the house while they are sleeping. Maybe they leave money or jewellery around and are worried about something going missing, or maybe they just aren't comfortable bumping into someone going to the bathroom.\n\nAgree though that they handled it badly. I don't think you messed up by not asking first.", "As older adults, I can see having rules about not having one-night stands sleep over, there's a safety issue involved. I had issues with roommates \"guests\" visiting rooms that they shouldn't be in (like MINE).\n\nWould the same apply to a SO of longer standing?", "NAH. Their house, their rules", "INFO: You mention your dad giving you the \"nod and wink\" - how did he know that you guys were/had actually had sex and that you weren't just two friends hanging out? That confuses me. \n\nI'm having trouble giving a judgement because my parents would have never let me have someone of the opposite sex over and in my room, let alone sleep over - even when I lived there at 21.", "YTA\nYour parents aren't roommates. The parent child dynamic will always exist, and if you want to live there, you should ask for the rules and expectations before you decide if this is right for you.

I had the impression this was a first?", "so they could control him again", "I don't know. I might be bothered by a stranger staying the night in my house unexpectedly.

That cultural divide has narrowed quite a bit in recent years. \n\nA lot of our government (US) is hiding our housing crisis behind made-up issues like \"woke agendas\" so you may not hear about it, but it's a huge issue here.", "If that's what they were worried about why wouldn't they *say that*", "You need to edit this post to say you are paying rent.", "Even if someone is an absolute believer in \"their house, their rules\" it still doesn't preclude the possibility of the homeowner being TA for *making* those rules.", "She might be an old friend to OP, but can still be a random woman they don't know to the parents.\n\nI do think there is a difference between a longer term partner that you have met multiple times before and a one night stand or stranger spending the night.

Can you point it out to me where it says she\u2019s a random woman to them? \n\nAlso please read the post and his edits.

It\u2019s not a thing in the UK. Unless you count my bedmate/ children\u2019s father/OH/love of my life/ whatever you want to call him. I\u2019m fairly sure he would not be happy with me inviting random men to come share a bed with us, no. \n\nBut at no point when I had flatmates did I try and control what they did. At some point everyone they dated or fucked was random to me. None of my buisness."]}
