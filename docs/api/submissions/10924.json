It's really easy to install a door knob with a lock on most doors.  It takes maybe 5-10 minutes to swap it out.  Just take some pictures of your existing door knob/door and show it to someone at a hardware store.  They will help you pick out a decent door knob that locks with a key.  There's a ton of videos on youtube that will show you exactly how to install it.   It's terrible you can't trust your own family not to steal your stuff.", "Nta but Put a nanny cam to your room.

Little brother thought it was all a game, OP and the sister both know it wasn't. OP can you explain to your parents why you need a good lock on your door?
