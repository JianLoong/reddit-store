{"id": 25536, "submission_id": "161srlz", "title": "AITA for not inviting my parents to my baby shower?", "selftext": "I (27f) am pregnant with my first child and my baby shower is scheduled for October. We sent invites out early because a few family members and friends wanted to come but needed to come from out of town for it. Two people we did not invite are my parents.\n\nThe reason for this is my parents have always clearly favored my sister. It started when we were 5 and 6 and she was diagnosed with cancer. I understand that it would shake any parent. I do not think it means ignore the other kid. It's not even the stuff they buy her. It's the way they talk about her. They always saying how proud they are of my sister and how they are so lucky to be her parents. They make a big deal out of every achievement of hers and I never get even a tenth of the energy and enthusiasm from them for mine. I was very angry for a long time. Then before my wedding my MIL suggested I sit down and talk to them and tell them how I felt.\n\nSo I sat down and I told them how I felt. They appeared caught off guard. I told them I wanted to feel like they were equally proud of me, that they loved me the same and felt as good about being my parents as they felt being my sister's. I pointed out many specific instances over the years. From birthday parties to our high school graduations where they were so emotional at my sister's and made a lot of speeches to mine where they didn't shed a single tear and spent more time talking to other people than focused on me. My sister even joined in on the conversation to point things out. They apologized and said they would do better.\n\nThe talk did nothing. My parents attended my wedding but there was no thoughtful speech/toast and no attempts to show me how important I am. My husband and I got a $50 gift card from them. MIL had to give me my something borrowed. Not only did my parents attend my sister's wedding a year after mine. They have the most beautiful speech at hers where they poured their hearts out. They gave her the something borrowed from mom (a necklace she wore on her wedding day) and they attempted to pay for their honeymoon as a gift and that was on top of them trying to pay for my sister's dress and offering to help with the planning.\n\nI decided after my sister's wedding that for my own sake, I needed to step back and not seek a relationship with them anymore. I couldn't handle being less important to them and even if it's not true, it's how I feel based on their actions. So my husband and I decided not to invite them to the shower. \n\nNow they know it's a thing and they know they were not invited and they called me for the first time in six or seven months, upset to hear I was having a baby shower and that they weren't invited. I told them I did not expect them to care that much and I was doing it to protect my heart. They said I should always invite them to this stuff and I never gave them a real chance to prove themselves.

Easy not the asshole I have given. You enjoy that shower with people who love you and make you know and feel it. \n\nThis is similar to my own story. I have two kids now neither of whom my parents met. Its the best thing for my heart\u2026and so do you too. \n\nI now feel loved with the people who are around me and I dont have to doubt myself. \n\nHold onto your safety. Much much love to you!!", "NTA They were given the ultimate chance (the wedding) to redeem themselves and they failed. You have every right to the feelings you are experiencing and are doing the right thing by protecting yourself (the shower). Also, keep in mind the third person in your new family. The baby needs protection from hurtful people as well. \n\nPS I am the mother of 32 year old man. If he came to me before his wedding and  poured his heart out as you did with you parents-you can be certain that my behavior would change. I would sincerely go above and beyond expectations.", "NTA\n\nYour parents seem toxic and it's probably best to stay low contact. You seem to have good in laws. I hope you and your family have the best of luck. NTA", "You are definitely not NTA.    \nHow many times  do they need to prove themselves?   \n.\nYou seem to have a great Mil. Stick with her and screw the others.   Family is not just blood . family is caring and love", "NTA\n\nTell them you gave them a chance to prove themselves and they failed making no effort at your Wedding, and again over did it at your Sisters Wedding.\n\nIt is so sad when families fall apart because 1 child gets all the attention.\n\nYou need to repay this back to your parents by no longer including them.", "This didn't go where I thought it was going after the first paragraph. For any parent, your kid getting cancer is absolutely going to change how you perceive things and how you parent. And it would be hard to blame them...for a little while. But into adulthood? After you expressed how you felt? The complete 180 between the two weddings? \n\nYeah, f that, definitely NTA", "NTA", "NTA. You spent your whole life giving them a \"real chance\" and even after you explained your feelings, and your sister stepped in to back you up, the emotional negligence continued. They are addicted to the drama that your sister's illness gave them, and that in itself is pretty sick\u2014if it was love, they would have no problem extending that to you.", "You gave them a **lifetime** of chances to prove themselves. And they failed, every time.   \nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou gave them every chance and now that they are facing actual consequences (their absence will make them look bad in front of other people) they want *you* to backtrack and *again* accommodate their failures so they won\u2019t have to sleep in the bed they made. You\u2019ve given enough to them, time to take care of yourself first. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened and you had to go through all of that. I wish you the best and I hope you and your inner child heal together gracefully.", "NTA. You need to protect your future children from any possible bias by grandparents. Don\u2019t make the same mistake and just go very very low contact", "NTA, and if you're truly worried about this I urge you to think of your child. You seem to be reaching milestones ahead of your sister (you had the first wedding then no mention of her having a baby). I would be willing to bet money that your special bundle of joy will be dropped as yesterday's news the second you get a niece or nephew. Don't let them get attached to grandparents who won't be willing to give them ongoing love and attention. \n\n\nI hope you have a fabulous shower surrounded by people that love you, and all the best for your exciting family expansion!", "Nta !

It sucks when parents make it blatantly obvious to everyone who their favorite is.", "Remind them you invited them to your wedding . That was their test and they failed you as parents. You are leaving them to be free to concentrate on their golden child and you dont need them in your life.", "NTA. 6 months of them not calling you? Ouch.", "NTA.  You are 27 years old - how many \"chances\" do they think they get?", "NTA. It\u2019s best you protect your heart and your child. As soon as your sister has a kid, it\u2019s going to be the same for your baby. Tell them actions are louder than words. Sorry I\u2019m sure it hurts but don\u2019t let them in, it will probably only lead to more hurt.", "Haha NTA. I\u2019d kill to be your mom and share your happiness. They don\u2019t deserve shit from you. Their  incompetence in parenting over the years is planned and executed by their own hand.", "Ntah and if they wanted to they could throw their own shower for you.", "NTA\nYour parents can enjoy your sister's baby shower when it comes along. They've had the opportunity to treat you equally after you told them how hurtful it feels to be treated as their \"other\" child. Their behavior did not improve. Strengthening your boundaries with them is the wise decision as they were hurtful given more access to your time, energy and special events.\n\nEnjoy an event without their throwing a pall over it with their minimal interest and participation. They don't add to the joy. They continued to treat you with dismissive disinterest. You need to stop their opportunities to spoil your big moments to truly begin to recover from their persistent emotional neglect. You are not responsible for fixing their feelings about losing the opportunity to disrespect and devalue you during your special events.", "NTA why would u invite them they seem incredibly toxic and they\u2019ve had plenty of chances including your wedding day. \n\nPlease don\u2019t fall for their guilt tripping and continue to protect your heart !!", "NTA. They had a chance to prove themselves after you had your chat and they didn't change. Fool you once, shame on them. Fool you twice, shame on you. Don't let them fool you again. You deserve better.", "NTA. You deserve to celebrate the big moments in your life without them being overshadowed by your parent\u2019s treatment of you as compared to your sister.", "I have always tried to remind myself of that too. But at some point you should remember that you have more than your sick child and that your other children need you. Mine never did. Maybe they never truly loved me as much. Maybe they got stuck like my sister thinks. All I know is I have spent 22 years without them.", "Not that unusual with them and me. When I think back, I made more contact with them than they ever did with me.", "I have no idea. They probably don't even realize they had many chances.", "Have you gone to therapy?
