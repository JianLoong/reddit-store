We sent invites out early because a few family members and friends wanted to come but needed to come from out of town for it. Two people we did not invite are my parents.\n\nThe reason for this is my parents have always clearly favored my sister. It started when we were 5 and 6 and she was diagnosed with cancer. I understand that it would shake any parent. I do not think it means ignore the other kid. It's not even the stuff they buy her. It's the way they talk about her. They always saying how proud they are of my sister and how they are so lucky to be her parents. They make a big deal out of every achievement of hers and I never get even a tenth of the energy and enthusiasm from them for mine. I was very angry for a long time. Then before my wedding my MIL suggested I sit down and talk to them and tell them how I felt.\n\nSo I sat down and I told them how I felt. They appeared caught off guard. I told them I wanted to feel like they were equally proud of me, that they loved me the same and felt as good about being my parents as they felt being my sister's. I pointed out many specific instances over the years. From birthday parties to our high school graduations where they were so emotional at my sister's and made a lot of speeches to mine where they didn't shed a single tear and spent more time talking to other people than focused on me. My sister even joined in on the conversation to point things out. They apologized and said they would do better.\n\nThe talk did nothing. My parents attended my wedding but there was no thoughtful speech/toast and no attempts to show me how important I am. My husband and I got a $50 gift card from them. MIL had to give me my something borrowed. Not only did my parents attend my sister's wedding a year after mine. They have the most beautiful speech at hers where they poured their hearts out. They gave her the something borrowed from mom (a necklace she wore on her wedding day) and they attempted to pay for their honeymoon as a gift and that was on top of them trying to pay for my sister's dress and offering to help with the planning.\n\nI decided after my sister's wedding that for my own sake, I needed to step back and not seek a relationship with them anymore. I couldn't handle being less important to them and even if it's not true, it's how I feel based on their actions. So my husband and I decided not to invite them to the shower. \n\nNow they know it's a thing and they know they were not invited and they called me for the first time in six or seven months, upset to hear I was having a baby shower and that they weren't invited. I told them I did not expect them to care that much and I was doing it to protect my heart. They said I should always invite them to this stuff and I never gave them a real chance to prove themselves.

Giving them chance after chance after chance only continues to hurt you and it's not fair that they expect that of you. They can still choose to show you love in other ways, without attending the baby shower, but they want you to make that effort first.
