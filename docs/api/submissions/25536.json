We sent invites out early because a few family members and friends wanted to come but needed to come from out of town for it. Two people we did not invite are my parents.\n\nThe reason for this is my parents have always clearly favored my sister. It started when we were 5 and 6 and she was diagnosed with cancer. I understand that it would shake any parent. I do not think it means ignore the other kid. It's not even the stuff they buy her. It's the way they talk about her. They always saying how proud they are of my sister and how they are so lucky to be her parents. They make a big deal out of every achievement of hers and I never get even a tenth of the energy and enthusiasm from them for mine. I was very angry for a long time. Then before my wedding my MIL suggested I sit down and talk to them and tell them how I felt.\n\nSo I sat down and I told them how I felt. They appeared caught off guard. I told them I wanted to feel like they were equally proud of me, that they loved me the same and felt as good about being my parents as they felt being my sister's. I pointed out many specific instances over the years. From birthday parties to our high school graduations where they were so emotional at my sister's and made a lot of speeches to mine where they didn't shed a single tear and spent more time talking to other people than focused on me. My sister even joined in on the conversation to point things out. They apologized and said they would do better.\n\nThe talk did nothing. My parents attended my wedding but there was no thoughtful speech/toast and no attempts to show me how important I am. My husband and I got a $50 gift card from them. MIL had to give me my something borrowed. Not only did my parents attend my sister's wedding a year after mine. They have the most beautiful speech at hers where they poured their hearts out. They gave her the something borrowed from mom (a necklace she wore on her wedding day) and they attempted to pay for their honeymoon as a gift and that was on top of them trying to pay for my sister's dress and offering to help with the planning.\n\nI decided after my sister's wedding that for my own sake, I needed to step back and not seek a relationship with them anymore. I couldn't handle being less important to them and even if it's not true, it's how I feel based on their actions. So my husband and I decided not to invite them to the shower. \n\nNow they know it's a thing and they know they were not invited and they called me for the first time in six or seven months, upset to hear I was having a baby shower and that they weren't invited. I told them I did not expect them to care that much and I was doing it to protect my heart. They said I should always invite them to this stuff and I never gave them a real chance to prove themselves.

For any parent, your kid getting cancer is absolutely going to change how you perceive things and how you parent. And it would be hard to blame them...for a little while. But into adulthood?

You spent your whole life giving them a \"real chance\" and even after you explained your feelings, and your sister stepped in to back you up, the emotional negligence continued.

It sucks when parents make it blatantly obvious to everyone who their favorite is.", "Remind them you invited them to your wedding . That was their test and they failed you as parents. You are leaving them to be free to concentrate on their golden child and you dont need them in your life.", "NTA. 6 months of them not calling you? Ouch.", "NTA.  You are 27 years old - how many \"chances\" do they think they get?", "NTA. It\u2019s best you protect your heart and your child. As soon as your sister has a kid, it\u2019s going to be the same for your baby. Tell them actions are louder than words. Sorry I\u2019m sure it hurts but don\u2019t let them in, it will probably only lead to more hurt.", "Haha NTA. I\u2019d kill to be your mom and share your happiness. They don\u2019t deserve shit from you. Their  incompetence in parenting over the years is planned and executed by their own hand.", "Ntah and if they wanted to they could throw their own shower for you.", "NTA\nYour parents can enjoy your sister's baby shower when it comes along. They've had the opportunity to treat you equally after you told them how hurtful it feels to be treated as their \"other\" child. Their behavior did not improve. Strengthening your boundaries with them is the wise decision as they were hurtful given more access to your time, energy and special events.\n\nEnjoy an event without their throwing a pall over it with their minimal interest and participation. They don't add to the joy. They continued to treat you with dismissive disinterest. You need to stop their opportunities to spoil your big moments to truly begin to recover from their persistent emotional neglect. You are not responsible for fixing their feelings about losing the opportunity to disrespect and devalue you during your special events.", "NTA why would u invite them they seem incredibly toxic and they\u2019ve had plenty of chances including your wedding day. \n\nPlease don\u2019t fall for their guilt tripping and continue to protect your heart !!", "NTA.

You deserve better.", "NTA. You deserve to celebrate the big moments in your life without them being overshadowed by your parent\u2019s treatment of you as compared to your sister.", "I have always tried to remind myself of that too. But at some point you should remember that you have more than your sick child and that your other children need you. Mine never did. Maybe they never truly loved me as much. Maybe they got stuck like my sister thinks. All I know is I have spent 22 years without them.", "Not that unusual with them and me.

Glass child syndrome is a real thing and I\u2019m sorry your childhood was less than.", "NTA. You gave them plenty of chances, they just didn\u2019t take them. They might want to play grandparents now, but my guess is that they will stop caring about your children the second your sister has children. Protect yourself and your child from them, and spend your time and energy on people whom you live and who loves you back.", "NTA!! I'm willing to bet this whole thing will transfer to any children sister has. \"If Sister hadn't survived cancer baby wouldn't have been here!!\" My father does this with my children and my sisters child. \n\nCut your losses and keep the family that actually cares.", "NTA. You tried, they showed you who they are. They don't get to treat you like a forgotten child until it makes them look bad. That's what this does, it makes them look bad. And that's OK, because they are bad.\n\nCongrats on the upcoming little one. Hope everything goes smoothly.", "NTA you had a conversation before the wedding where they said they\u2019d do better and nothing changed. Your wedding was their chance to prove themselves if they couldn\u2019t do it then they never will. Stepping back is not only best for yourself but your baby.

And when they are here, guard your child's heart from those people because history will repeat itself.

Don't invite the negativity. You and your baby do not need that emotional pain.\n\nNTA. I wish you all the very best.", "Absolutely, positively NTA in any way. They've had 27 years to \"prove\" themselves. I can't imagine not calling my pregnant daughter to check up on her for six or seven days, they've ignored you for six or seven months! The only reason they care is because people will ask where they are and they are afraid you will out them as the horrible parents they have been to you. The fact that your sister joined in on your soul baring talk should have been a real wake up call. \nTell them you are giving them as much consideration as they have given you.

IT IS NOT ON YOU TO KEEP PUTTING YOURSELF out there.\n\nIf they want a relationship, they can make the effort and maybe by time your kid is graduating high school you'll want them there.  Seriously, tho.  Say: When you HAVE proven yourself(by actual actions) then we'll discuss you being in my life again, until then, I don't have the bandwidth for your emotional neglect.", "Nta.\nYou tried and nothing changed.\nIt really is OK to go low/no contact with family.", "NTA.

You're right to stop it now before they start doing it to your child.", "Is it always up to the mother and the mother-in-law of the expectant mother to throw the bridal shower, if they really wanted a chance, They would\u2019ve planned it for you. NTA", "NTA. You poured your heart out to them and saw zero changes, even after their (half-assed) promises to do better. They showed their true colors. Save yourself and your baby the future heartaches and disappointments that will inevitably come up. You don\u2019t need them in your life.", "Your wedding was the chance for them to prove themselves. They blew it. NTA.", "NTA.  If you want to justify yourself point out the difference in weddings.\n\nBut ultimately I think you should just tell them that even when the issue was brought to their attention they did nothing.  They haven't called you in half a year or more, they have not demonstrated they value you at all.  And so instead of just hoping for them to show up just one time you've decided it's healthier for everyone if the familial relationship was just ended.", "NTA.

I cannot even imagine finding out that your child is pregnant with your grandchild and just ... not calling to see how she's doing?\n\nI've got two guesses on why they care now: 1.) They know it will look bad to other family/friends (they're not ashamed of showing marked favoritism but they're afraid of people knowing that OP is upset enough about it to cut them off). Or 2.) depending on the type of cancer and the type of treatments she underwent, there's a higher than average chance that the sister won't be able to have children so OP's kid(s) will be their only chance to have grandchildren (they may not care enough about OP to put in the effort but they care about what she can give them)", "They\u2019ll do the same to the grandkids. I bet when your sis has kids they\u2019ll fall all over themselves to be there, and not go 6 months w/o calling her during her pregnancy.", "They never loved you.", "No contact is the answer to protect yourself and your child.  Communicate with them and Y W B T A", "How are things with your sister, it sounded like she was on your side?", "This is not even a diagnosis."]}
