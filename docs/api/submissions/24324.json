Studies have shown a strong relationship between traits between schizoid and autism. Autism is typically noticed in first in children and schizoid is typically diagnosed in young adults. \n\nThere have been many cases of people being diagnosed with Aspergers (now autism level 1) by accident instead of being diagnosed with schizoid - this has typically happened with children. \n\nWhether he can be diagnosed in 2 sessions completely depends on his assessment. People have been diagnosed within days and some people may take months to diagnose. Sometimes you don\u2019t even need to interview family members. \n\nMy Aspergers diagnosis took 2 session for my psychiatrist to diagnose. I spent a total of 3 hours with her and the diagnosis does indeed fit. \n\nPersonality disorders as a whole are complex but I would argue that schizoid certainly is not the most complex.

That\u2019s not implausible.", "If you think about OP's actions without emotion or tradition influencing your opinion then you see that when OP didn't respond to the RSVP it was the equivalent of responding to the RSVP and declining to attend. Without OPs written agreement to attend or speak with the family about attending most would find it would have been safe to assume OP would not be attending. Also the RSVP was sent via email so there are lots of reasons he may not have responded such as the email was not delivered, OP lost access to his emails , the file was corrupted, the response to the RSVP was not returned to engaged couple and etc. During the final count for the wedding most people reach out to the individuals that they would especially like to attend to confirm if they will be attending or if additional accommodations/concessions will need to be made on their behalf. The couple could have asked OP's parents to confirm your attendance because they seem to be the only family in regular contact with you. It is definitely odd that once they realized they did not get a response why didn't they reach out to ask when you would arrive, how long you would stay in the area, or if there were any work projects/traveling that would prevent your attendance or a late arrival/early departure. If the failure to followup on your RSVP slipped through the craccks it indicates your presence had nominal effect on their celebration which is fine because that doesn't bother you at all. It seems like they are more upset with your lack of anger/disappointment that they forgot to make sure you would attend and the fact that you are unbothered about missing the entire affair due to work obligations.  \n\nANOTHER weird thing for me about your family  is that once they learned of your diagnosis your sister didn't want you around her kids. But literally the family tried to rip you a new one recently for not spending quality time as a family. Nothing about your behavior towards the family has changed since the diagnosis. It seems like your sister is being wilfully ignorant about your diagnosis and turning you into some kind of boogeyman their children should be wary of and avoid contact with.
