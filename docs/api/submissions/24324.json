Good Luck with your new position and genuinely smiled that you genuinely laughed at joke :) YTA still for what you did, but big ups for apologizing and your handling of everything that followed! Just keep swimming", "Hey there,\n\nGood to hear. I wouldnt call it quits immediatly with your family, maybe just for now and see where the path with your therapy is leading you - maybe in a year or so you might want to have a relationship? \n\nI am glad this helped you and made you realize some things (even though you are still TA ;) ). You have to figure stuff out and to see where it leads you and what is right for you. This will take time. Good luck :)", "Great job on the diagnosis and the laughter! Joke's are awesome ( for me), and you getting to enjoy one made me happy too. Good luck with therapy!", "Let's call bullshit on all this straight away as no competent qualified psychiatrist would arrive at a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder so quickly.
