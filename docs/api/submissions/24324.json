Good Luck with your new position and genuinely smiled that you genuinely laughed at joke :) YTA still for what you did, but big ups for apologizing and your handling of everything that followed! Just keep swimming", "Hey there,\n\nGood to hear. I wouldnt call it quits immediatly with your family, maybe just for now and see where the path with your therapy is leading you - maybe in a year or so you might want to have a relationship? \n\nI am glad this helped you and made you realize some things (even though you are still TA ;) ). You have to figure stuff out and to see where it leads you and what is right for you. This will take time. Good luck :)", "Great job on the diagnosis and the laughter! Joke's are awesome ( for me), and you getting to enjoy one made me happy too. Good luck with therapy!", "Let's call bullshit on all this straight away as no competent qualified psychiatrist would arrive at a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder so quickly.

Good luck.", "Yta", "I'm a bit concerned about your management capability, given your situation and that the basics like sending a RSVP isn't instinctive.  Might want to talk about that with the shrink, because this is a big job responsibility change, and get some coaching from work about their expectations of communication and supervision in your new role.", "Tell me you don't understand ASD without telling me. Social cues are often much much harder for people on the spectrum.", "[deleted]", "Asshole is asshole it don\u2019t matter why", "As I understood it, OP is already in a Supervisorposition. So he might not suck at it ;) however, more social competences will help him in future with his job regardless.", "Your family wouldn\u2019t just immediately cut contact like this without some prior shenanigans. This is very unusual. Methinks this is not the first time you have been so heinously inconsiderate. But hey! Sounds like you don\u2019t really miss human interaction with your family, so live your life how you want I guess.", "https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15901i5/aita_for_not_specifically_calling_my_brother_to/?ref=share&ref_source=link\n\nOriginal post", "I find your sisters' decision not to have you around their kids at all to be unnecessarily harsh, unless of course that is your preference. Sure you might never be the cuddly fun uncle the kids love to spend time or be super close to them but you're still family.  Now that you're open with your diagnosis I feel this is a teachable moment for your neices and nephews that some people just operate differently in their mind.\n\nEither way, good luck with your development and I hope you find fulfillment in whatever you choose to pursue.", "I disagree. It sounds like OPs brain works exceptionally well in some environments and lacks in others. He\u2019s likely a good manager because he doesn\u2019t get personally invested, doesn\u2019t gossip and is just professional. He\u2019s also mentally resilient in situations where others are not. He lacks the social skills or empathy to realize it\u2019s rude not to respond to RSVP. Very different things.", "Not necessarily.  It took two sessions (the second one involving interviewing family members) for my psychiatrist to diagnose me, and he told me he held off the diagnosis until after the family interviews because I was so textbook autistic that he initially thought I was trying to emulate 'proper' autistic behaviour. Sometimes it really is *that* obvious to the trained eye.", "I've read hundreds of psych evals. Yes they do.", "In the UK you get 1 or 2 sessions (if very needed) for any diagnosis. So yes, they can diagnose someone within two sessions. :)", "I got pinged on my first visit. My psych said I was a textbook case. So textbook in fact it was eerie.", "I mean, isn\u2019t diagnosing just\u2026 matching symptoms? I don\u2019t see why a doctor would need a ton of time to do that", "I witnessed someone getting diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder within 15 minutes at a VA psych ward. Not only was he diagnosed, but also given 100% disability through the VA and will be paid for the rest of his life. It isn't always that easy, but some cases are so cut and dry they are.", "All 3 of his sisters openly stated that they don\u2019t want him near their kids???? What an odd throwaway sentence", "I was specifically talking about Schizoid Personality Disorder, and most competent psychiatrists would not diagnose someone with this after meeting them twice. It's too complex a disorder and would usually be a much later diagnosis after ruling out other psychotic illnesses and personality disorders. \n\nAnd to diagnose someone with concomonent autistic spectrum disorder and schizoid personality disorder after two sessions is just so unlikely for a competent psychiatrist that I'm calling bullshit", "[removed]", "I got pinged on my first visit. My psych said I was a textbook case. So textbook in fact it was eerie.", "Then they aren't competent psychiatrists as schizoid personality disorder is the rarest of main strand personality disorders \nI've over 20 years experience in the field but I didn't include that in my original post because guess what, people can lie on the internet, I know shocking revelation but there ya go", "Soundz really simple when you put it like that, sure anyone could do that.     /s", "Yeah that\u2019s one of the things that sticks out here. There is WAY more going on than what the OP has said. One instance of inconsideration and social gaffe such as this doesn\u2019t warrant THREE separate people to say \u201cstay away from my kids\u201d. This was just the proverbial last straw.", "Could be stigma from his diagnosis? Especially since OP doesn't seem the type want to be around their kids anyway.", "Yes and no. Studies have shown a strong relationship between traits between schizoid and autism. Autism is typically noticed in first in children and schizoid is typically diagnosed in young adults. \n\nThere have been many cases of people being diagnosed with Aspergers (now autism level 1) by accident instead of being diagnosed with schizoid - this has typically happened with children. \n\nWhether he can be diagnosed in 2 sessions completely depends on his assessment. People have been diagnosed within days and some people may take months to diagnose. Sometimes you don\u2019t even need to interview family members. \n\nMy Aspergers diagnosis took 2 session for my psychiatrist to diagnose. I spent a total of 3 hours with her and the diagnosis does indeed fit. \n\nPersonality disorders as a whole are complex but I would argue that schizoid certainly is not the most complex. Paired with an autism diagnosis it can honestly make a lot of sense.\n\nEdit: apologies for grammar errors, it was 2am when I was writing this out \ud83d\ude34", "He probably has a long history of being rude and they're fed up of him.", "People also just assume people are lying when they hear something that doesn't fit the mold of their experience. There ya go.", "The vibe I get is OP has always been detached from his family and at this point you'd think they'd just accept it. That strong a reaction from them makes me think OP isn't great, but his family isn't that much better.", "Maybe, but that would definitely make them the assholes. That\u2019s not implausible."]}
