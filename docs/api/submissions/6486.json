If they cut back even a fraction of that they can cover the booking that was meant for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA You never agreed to go and they just booked for you. They have no right to decide what you do with your money or your time. The fact that your partner also completely disregarded what you said and just assumed you weren't serious and would change your mind would make me very angry and make me feel very disrespected if I was you.", "NTA. You haven\u2019t changed your mind. SO needs to accept that and decide if he still wants to go, or do something else with you.

Never get voluntold anything.  If they want you to go so desperately, brother can pay for it, after he pays you back for all the extra you spent last year.", "NTA. You made your feelings clear. Odd that your \"SO\" assumed you'd change your mind \u2014 and never followed up with you to see that you had. Did he have any idea how much you disliked the other trip? I'd reconsider your relationship.", "NTA, not even close", "NTA\n\nAnd your bf doesn't respect your thoughts, opinions, or comfort.", "NTA, sounds awful. In what universe can you not get a refund on a booking made a year in advance?? I don't think it will be as big of a deal as they're making it out to be.", "NTA but you probably should have mentioned to all parties that you weren't interested in going as soon as it was brought up. If anything it's an asshole move to try to financially trap people into doing things instead of getting clear consent on costs.", "Definitely NTA....that is your husband", "You sound like me telling a group of 30 friends that I'm not going to Burning Man with them and my husband.\n\nStay strong!

You made yourself clear, and he ignored/ didn\u2019t pass on your message.", "NTA.\n\nTheir decision to book it was on them as they assumed without checking if you wanted to go.\n\nYour BF is also being an manipulative AH, as YOU told him you didn't plan to go. It's controlling for him to try and force it.", "NTA. You said you wouldn't go, you are not going. End of.\n\nYour BF on the other hand does not seem to care at all if you have fun on a holiday. Which, in your shoes, would bother me. I like a partner who cares about my comfort and enjoyment too.", "NTA. This is your bf's mistake, let him pay for your spot.", "Lol, it sounds like they couldn\u2019t pay you enough to go-and yet they want you to pay *them* to go to this little slice of hell. \n\nYou clearly stated you would not participate in another delightful vacation with these people, and yet you have been soundly ignored. Any of these would be vacationers financial problems are not *your* problems. \n\nNTA You don\u2019t wanna go. You don\u2019t *have* to go. They can\u2019t make you go.

They are not for time spent being stressed, unhappy and having your choises (and money) taken away.\n\nTell your partner that you should have been asked first, and that you were so clear about this last time that now this is not your problem.", "NTA, tbh you and your partner don't seem super compatible. You say he thought you'd have changed your mind by now. Do you often do that? Or does he disregard your strong feelings on some issues?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, don't go. Don't set this precedent.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA if his parents aren\u2019t well off then wtf are they booking pricey vacations where they buy EVERYONES tickets?\n\nWhat are they doing going on vacations every other year? \n\nLastly - if you suggesting the well to do parents cover his parents cost is insensitive then what the fuck does he call him ignoring your requests to not go on a pricey vacation?\n\nAlso not even sure of the logic of \u201cso if you don\u2019t go they won\u2019t afford to go\u201d\nIf the tickets are already bought\u2026 they\u2019ve literally already afforded it.

So maybe he just tuned it out rather than taking it seriously - which isn't great, but otherwise we do communicate well otherwise.", "To them it was great. They used to go as kids in the 90s and love walking down memory lane, but to me it's worthless. I even suggested a compromise that we do something else for the first half of the holiday - like a canal boat trip or walking holiday and meet up for the last 3 nights and was shot down in flames because \"if i'm going away with my family, i'm spending time with my family\" so, it is what it is i guess.", "We are compatible. 11 years down the line i think so anyway.  \n\n\nThis is just something we've disagreed on.", "Indeed.", "There should have been more recent communication on both sides when the trip was coming around again this year.", "I don't understand why you just don't reply in the group chat that you won't be attending. Like, I apologize if there was some sort of communication ~~by~~ but I informed partner a year ago or something like that.\n\nedited for grammar", "Like I said, wasn't placing blame to avoid adding drama because I can't see inside your relationship. \n\nCommunicating requires both speaking and listening. He clearly didn't incorporate what you said, didn't communicate the vacation plans to you, and then after you reminded him, still tries to say it's your responsibility to go along because somebody else needs you to pay their way somehow?\n\nThat doesn't sound like healthy communication to me.\n\nPerhaps when it comes to his family, that drowns out everything you say, which tells me that in this relationship either he or his family are #1 and #2, and you are #3.", "The cost thing doesn't make sense then if they've booked this exact trip before you ever went. They are asking for you to share the costs of the chalet but they would be getting the chalet if your partner had a gf or not! They didn't cover any of your costs for your food or entertainment so you not going will do nothing but save you money and a terrible time LOL", "That's good. I was just wondering bc I have a tendency to have strong initial feelings about things and then over time I back down a bit and realize I've perhaps been over emotional. My last partner was used to this so he would do the same as yours, just assume I'd change my mind. In your case, I really hope you don't go. It sounds really awful for a holiday.", "NTA. God is this Butlins? It sounds like Butlins. Don't go, I agreed to more than a few memory-lane motivated en masse trips and I wish I hadn't. I am actually grateful for the year I got ravaged by bedbugs as it gave me a life long get out card. \n\nFor those who love Butlins, I'm pleased for you & hope you continue to build years of happy memories, it's just not for me.", "NTA - you made your feelings clear. You gave notice *far* in advance you would not be attending. He made incorrect assumptions and booked the trip anyway. Poor planning on someone else's part does not require an obligation for you.", "NTA. Your boyfriend admitted to keeping you included while hoping you'd change your mind. This is not your issue. He needs to figure it out with his family or pay the difference himself.", "It was presumptuous of him to sign you up. Tell him it\u2019s on him. He can work extra hours and pay for it.", "NTA. He is.", "NTA\n\nYou set clear boundaries, and your boyfriend ignored them.

Sounds like a nightmare I\u2019m sorry", "Nta you told him no, and he didn't listen or thought he could strong arm you into going with 'its already booked!'  To bad.  The fact that they can't go without you is not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nAnd its their problem that your boyfriend helped create.  He didn't communicate this plan of his so he shouldn't be surprised that it's not working.", "NTA.  Talk about insensitive.  Your boyfriend is insensitive.", "NTA, They ripped they off last time and they'll do the same again. You made your position clear so if they booked you in, that's on them. You have no obligation to fix their deliberate mistake.", "NTA for not wanting to go. BUT, you should let them know ASAP in case there\u2019s a small window of time they can cancel your room.", "NTA, it\u2019s over a year away, tell him they have time to figure it out.", "lol wow if you dont go then the old folks cant go either I call BS that isnt the full story", "NTA - but your boyfriend and his family is using you for babysitting (parents and child) and your money.

Maybe in this one instance, but you're wrong if you think this is how day to day life is.  \n\n\nI love his mother and brother, his wife and my nephew. \n\nI just fuckin hated that holiday.", "NTA It is not your job to financially sponsor their trip, especially when it costs too much for you and you already said no.
