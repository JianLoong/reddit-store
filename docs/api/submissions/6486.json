If they cut back even a fraction of that they can cover the booking that was meant for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA You never agreed to go and they just booked for you. They have no right to decide what you do with your money or your time. The fact that your partner also completely disregarded what you said and just assumed you weren't serious and would change your mind would make me very angry and make me feel very disrespected if I was you.", "NTA. You haven\u2019t changed your mind. SO needs to accept that and decide if he still wants to go, or do something else with you.

Never get voluntold anything.  If they want you to go so desperately, brother can pay for it, after he pays you back for all the extra you spent last year.", "NTA. You made your feelings clear. Odd that your \"SO\" assumed you'd change your mind \u2014 and never followed up with you to see that you had. Did he have any idea how much you disliked the other trip? I'd reconsider your relationship.", "NTA, not even close", "NTA\n\nAnd your bf doesn't respect your thoughts, opinions, or comfort.", "NTA, sounds awful. In what universe can you not get a refund on a booking made a year in advance?? I don't think it will be as big of a deal as they're making it out to be.", "NTA but you probably should have mentioned to all parties that you weren't interested in going as soon as it was brought up. If anything it's an asshole move to try to financially trap people into doing things instead of getting clear consent on costs.", "Definitely NTA....that is your husband", "You sound like me telling a group of 30 friends that I'm not going to Burning Man with them and my husband.\n\nStay strong!

You made yourself clear, and he ignored/ didn\u2019t pass on your message.", "NTA.\n\nTheir decision to book it was on them as they assumed without checking if you wanted to go.\n\nYour BF is also being an manipulative AH, as YOU told him you didn't plan to go. It's controlling for him to try and force it.", "NTA. You said you wouldn't go, you are not going. End of.\n\nYour BF on the other hand does not seem to care at all if you have fun on a holiday. Which, in your shoes, would bother me. I like a partner who cares about my comfort and enjoyment too.", "NTA. This is your bf's mistake, let him pay for your spot.", "Lol, it sounds like they couldn\u2019t pay you enough to go-and yet they want you to pay *them* to go to this little slice of hell. \n\nYou clearly stated you would not participate in another delightful vacation with these people, and yet you have been soundly ignored. Any of these would be vacationers financial problems are not *your* problems. \n\nNTA You don\u2019t wanna go. You don\u2019t *have* to go. They can\u2019t make you go.

You say he thought you'd have changed your mind by now. Do you often do that? Or does he disregard your strong feelings on some issues?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, don't go. Don't set this precedent.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA if his parents aren\u2019t well off then wtf are they booking pricey vacations where they buy EVERYONES tickets?\n\nWhat are they doing going on vacations every other year? \n\nLastly - if you suggesting the well to do parents cover his parents cost is insensitive then what the fuck does he call him ignoring your requests to not go on a pricey vacation?\n\nAlso not even sure of the logic of \u201cso if you don\u2019t go they won\u2019t afford to go\u201d\nIf the tickets are already bought\u2026 they\u2019ve literally already afforded it.

So maybe he just tuned it out rather than taking it seriously - which isn't great, but otherwise we do communicate well otherwise.", "To them it was great. They used to go as kids in the 90s and love walking down memory lane, but to me it's worthless. I even suggested a compromise that we do something else for the first half of the holiday - like a canal boat trip or walking holiday and meet up for the last 3 nights and was shot down in flames because \"if i'm going away with my family, i'm spending time with my family\" so, it is what it is i guess.", "We are compatible. 11 years down the line i think so anyway.  \n\n\nThis is just something we've disagreed on.", "Indeed.", "There should have been more recent communication on both sides when the trip was coming around again this year.", "I don't understand why you just don't reply in the group chat that you won't be attending. Like, I apologize if there was some sort of communication ~~by~~ but I informed partner a year ago or something like that.\n\nedited for grammar", "Like I said, wasn't placing blame to avoid adding drama because I can't see inside your relationship. \n\nCommunicating requires both speaking and listening. He clearly didn't incorporate what you said, didn't communicate the vacation plans to you, and then after you reminded him, still tries to say it's your responsibility to go along because somebody else needs you to pay their way somehow?\n\nThat doesn't sound like healthy communication to me.\n\nPerhaps when it comes to his family, that drowns out everything you say, which tells me that in this relationship either he or his family are #1 and #2, and you are #3.", "The cost thing doesn't make sense then if they've booked this exact trip before you ever went. They are asking for you to share the costs of the chalet but they would be getting the chalet if your partner had a gf or not! They didn't cover any of your costs for your food or entertainment so you not going will do nothing but save you money and a terrible time LOL", "That's good. I was just wondering bc I have a tendency to have strong initial feelings about things and then over time I back down a bit and realize I've perhaps been over emotional. My last partner was used to this so he would do the same as yours, just assume I'd change my mind. In your case, I really hope you don't go. It sounds really awful for a holiday.", "NTA. God is this Butlins? It sounds like Butlins. Don't go, I agreed to more than a few memory-lane motivated en masse trips and I wish I hadn't. I am actually grateful for the year I got ravaged by bedbugs as it gave me a life long get out card. \n\nFor those who love Butlins, I'm pleased for you & hope you continue to build years of happy memories, it's just not for me.", "NTA - you made your feelings clear. You gave notice *far* in advance you would not be attending. He made incorrect assumptions and booked the trip anyway. Poor planning on someone else's part does not require an obligation for you.", "NTA. Your boyfriend admitted to keeping you included while hoping you'd change your mind. This is not your issue. He needs to figure it out with his family or pay the difference himself.", "It was presumptuous of him to sign you up. Tell him it\u2019s on him. He can work extra hours and pay for it.", "NTA. He is.", "NTA\n\nYou set clear boundaries, and your boyfriend ignored them.

Sounds like a nightmare I\u2019m sorry", "Nta you told him no, and he didn't listen or thought he could strong arm you into going with 'its already booked!'  To bad.  The fact that they can't go without you is not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nAnd its their problem that your boyfriend helped create.  He didn't communicate this plan of his so he shouldn't be surprised that it's not working.", "NTA.  Talk about insensitive.  Your boyfriend is insensitive.", "NTA, They ripped they off last time and they'll do the same again. You made your position clear so if they booked you in, that's on them. You have no obligation to fix their deliberate mistake.", "NTA for not wanting to go. BUT, you should let them know ASAP in case there\u2019s a small window of time they can cancel your room.", "NTA, it\u2019s over a year away, tell him they have time to figure it out.", "lol wow if you dont go then the old folks cant go either I call BS that isnt the full story", "NTA - but your boyfriend and his family is using you for babysitting (parents and child) and your money.

Maybe in this one instance, but you're wrong if you think this is how day to day life is.  \n\n\nI love his mother and brother, his wife and my nephew. \n\nI just fuckin hated that holiday.", "NTA It is not your job to financially sponsor their trip, especially when it costs too much for you and you already said no.

Don\u2019t go, don\u2019t pay.", "It sounds like a fairly cheap vacation from the description (\u00a3200-\u00a3300 each) and I think the whole point is they weren't ever going to pay for everyone (so will be out of pocket if OP doesn't pay her share). It sounds to me like OPs partner agreed on her behalf and it's him not them that are being the AH in this scenario.", "I do like one of them, but can understand how people with a different disposition than me would hate it to the core \ud83e\udd23", "Nah has to be Pontins. God only knows why people still willingly book Pontins. \n\nNTA op.", "They've booked it assuming (or because bf told them) that she'd pay her portion of the room costs.", "Spot on.", "*she* isn\u2019t going. He still plans to attend and will keep trying to convince OP to change her mind.", "Lose 150lbs of dead weight IMMEDIATELY.", "You are being more than fair here. You\u2019ve given an option to do part of the holiday with family and part of the holiday without, and that\u2019s not good enough for your boyfriend. Let\u2019s be honest, you\u2019re both adults in your 30s without children - not being unkind but A LOT of people would not want to have to go on a big \u2018family holiday\u2019 with their partner or spouse\u2019s family at your age without children. I know I\u2019d prefer to use my precious annual leave for holidays with my husband alone.\n\nLike I love my in-laws and I know I couldn\u2019t hack a week with them. It would do my head in and they are the loveliest people, I am just an extroverted introvert and would struggle to be \u2018on\u2019 and social constantly for that long. So the longest my husband gets with me with his parents is 5 days for any visit (either us staying at theirs or them coming here), take it or leave it. In return I never ask for more from him for my own family either.\n\nIt\u2019s all a compromise, sometimes he goes to his parents without me and sometimes I suck it up and go visit for a few days with him even when I don\u2019t reallllly want to, and visa versa. Maybe we will do a week abroad with them when we have kids but that will be for the kids to have those happy memories with their grandparents, not for us (well not for me lol).\n\nBasically you\u2019re being really fair imo and NTA at all.", "\"My boyfriend ignores me, but in his defense I talk a lot.\" Don't excuse this. He planned to be able to guilt-trip you into going, which is exaftly what he is doing and why you're posting on here and not enjoying your day.", "I always think of Centre Parks as a posh Butlins because its so much more expensive. I love it but completely understand how others would hate it.", "If that's the case it's husbands problem for pulling that stunt in the first place. How he can explain to his family that he just cost them money they will lost on deposits and bookings that he said she was coming to when he knew full well she wasn't. He tried to force the situation and got burned.", "Wouldn\u2019t the husband need his own room anyway? \n\nThe only nonrefundable cost is the accommodation. Sounds like the husband just wants her to help him pay for his room and is grasping at straws to pressure her to come.", "That's not even the point - if OP had said nothing (maybe to not hurt her partners feelings or whatever) you don't book and pay for a holiday before everyone agrees. What if she couldn't book the time of work, couldn't afford to go, or (as is the case) didn't want to!", "A thousand times this. Also have a suspicion he figured he could just make her do it by ignoring her saying she didn't want to", "To what purpose? She had already told him she would not go.", "Heard fab things about the Longleat Centreparcs :)", "And now he can pay with his own money. She said boyfirend, not husband. Hopefully she will have enough sense to never merge finances with him.", "I agree, I've said so elsewhere, just pointing out that his parents will be out of pocket and it is possible they can't afford that if their finances are tight. Not for a second saying that it's OPs problem.", "I think they're all sharing an apartment, so it's being split 3 ways rather than 4 (or whatever it is) if she's not coming.", "INFO did he go without you the other 8 years?", "Or marry him", "That's damn shitty I'd him to do that to his family but you and I both know he'll spin that a different way."]}
