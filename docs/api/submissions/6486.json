Me and my SO over spent by almost \u00a32000 between us because his brother had lined up a load of activities for everyone to do without telling us, all of which cost a bomb.

Remind him about how much they spent on activities and eating out last year. If they cut back even a fraction of that they can cover the booking that was meant for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA You never agreed to go and they just booked for you. They have no right to decide what you do with your money or your time. The fact that your partner also completely disregarded what you said and just assumed you weren't serious and would change your mind would make me very angry and make me feel very disrespected if I was you.", "NTA. You haven\u2019t changed your mind. SO needs to accept that and decide if he still wants to go, or do something else with you. Unless he\u2019s actually bound to go, then he can pay your 150 for actually believing you\u2019d want a repeat of the last \u201cvacation\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nWithout placing blame: you and your partner do not seem to be communicating well, given this situation.", "NTA.  Never get voluntold anything.  If they want you to go so desperately, brother can pay for it, after he pays you back for all the extra you spent last year.", "NTA. You made your feelings clear. Odd that your \"SO\" assumed you'd change your mind \u2014 and never followed up with you to see that you had. Did he have any idea how much you disliked the other trip? I'd reconsider your relationship.", "NTA, not even close", "NTA\n\nAnd your bf doesn't respect your thoughts, opinions, or comfort.", "NTA, sounds awful. In what universe can you not get a refund on a booking made a year in advance?? I don't think it will be as big of a deal as they're making it out to be.", "NTA but you probably should have mentioned to all parties that you weren't interested in going as soon as it was brought up. If anything it's an asshole move to try to financially trap people into doing things instead of getting clear consent on costs.", "Definitely NTA....that is your husband", "You sound like me telling a group of 30 friends that I'm not going to Burning Man with them and my husband.\n\nStay strong! NTA", "NTA. Sounds like your BF expected you to just forget about what you said and let them book the trip anyway. You made yourself clear, and he ignored/ didn\u2019t pass on your message.", "NTA.\n\nTheir decision to book it was on them as they assumed without checking if you wanted to go.\n\nYour BF is also being an manipulative AH, as YOU told him you didn't plan to go. It's controlling for him to try and force it.", "NTA. You said you wouldn't go, you are not going. End of.\n\nYour BF on the other hand does not seem to care at all if you have fun on a holiday. Which, in your shoes, would bother me. I like a partner who cares about my comfort and enjoyment too.", "NTA. This is your bf's mistake, let him pay for your spot.", "Lol, it sounds like they couldn\u2019t pay you enough to go-and yet they want you to pay *them* to go to this little slice of hell. \n\nYou clearly stated you would not participate in another delightful vacation with these people, and yet you have been soundly ignored. Any of these would be vacationers financial problems are not *your* problems. \n\nNTA You don\u2019t wanna go. You don\u2019t *have* to go. They can\u2019t make you go. Enjoy  the peace and quiet of their \nabsense.", "NTA... \nVacations are ideally meant for \"reloading your batteries\"... They are not for time spent being stressed, unhappy and having your choises (and money) taken away.\n\nTell your partner that you should have been asked first, and that you were so clear about this last time that now this is not your problem.", "NTA, tbh you and your partner don't seem super compatible. You say he thought you'd have changed your mind by now. Do you often do that? Or does he disregard your strong feelings on some issues?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, don't go. Don't set this precedent.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA if his parents aren\u2019t well off then wtf are they booking pricey vacations where they buy EVERYONES tickets?\n\nWhat are they doing going on vacations every other year? \n\nLastly - if you suggesting the well to do parents cover his parents cost is insensitive then what the fuck does he call him ignoring your requests to not go on a pricey vacation?\n\nAlso not even sure of the logic of \u201cso if you don\u2019t go they won\u2019t afford to go\u201d\nIf the tickets are already bought\u2026 they\u2019ve literally already afforded it. Less they took out a loan or stupid booked their vacation by maxing out a credit card.\n\nNTA. Like, at all.", "NTA and Id love an update after you stand your ground with him. Have you explained to him how miserable you were at these things? Surely he's not oblivious to what's going on.", "NTA, you said you were not going....he booked anyway.   End of story.", "Absolutely NTA. You're being forced to go on a holiday which isn't your thing and forced to pay for something you don't want.\n\nIt's their problem, not yours.", "Definitely not too late to dump the manipulative BF", "I was very vocal about my feelings (to him) from the second we got home, but I think in his defence, I'm very vocal about my feelings on a lot of things. So maybe he just tuned it out rather than taking it seriously - which isn't great, but otherwise we do communicate well otherwise.", "To them it was great. They used to go as kids in the 90s and love walking down memory lane, but to me it's worthless. I even suggested a compromise that we do something else for the first half of the holiday - like a canal boat trip or walking holiday and meet up for the last 3 nights and was shot down in flames because \"if i'm going away with my family, i'm spending time with my family\" so, it is what it is i guess.", "We are compatible. 11 years down the line i think so anyway.  \n\n\nThis is just something we've disagreed on.", "Indeed.", "There should have been more recent communication on both sides when the trip was coming around again this year.", "I don't understand why you just don't reply in the group chat that you won't be attending. Like, I apologize if there was some sort of communication by I informed partner a year ago or something like that.", "Like I said, wasn't placing blame to avoid adding drama because I can't see inside your relationship. \n\nCommunicating requires both speaking and listening. He clearly didn't incorporate what you said, didn't communicate the vacation plans to you, and then after you reminded him, still tries to say it's your responsibility to go along because somebody else needs you to pay their way somehow?\n\nThat doesn't sound like healthy communication to me.\n\nPerhaps when it comes to his family, that drowns out everything you say, which tells me that in this relationship either he or his family are #1 and #2, and you are #3.", "The cost thing doesn't make sense then if they've booked this exact trip before you ever went. They are asking for you to share the costs of the chalet but they would be getting the chalet if your partner had a gf or not! They didn't cover any of your costs for your food or entertainment so you not going will do nothing but save you money and a terrible time LOL", "That's good. I was just wondering bc I have a tendency to have strong initial feelings about things and then over time I back down a bit and realize I've perhaps been over emotional. My last partner was used to this so he would do the same as yours, just assume I'd change my mind. In your case, I really hope you don't go. It sounds really awful for a holiday."]}
