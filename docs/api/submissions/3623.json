I've worked very hard to be at this point in my education and I don't want to sacrifice that.\n\nI do get a stipend to help with living expenses, but this comes out to less than $20K a year. Thankfully, my older sister and her husband have allowed me to live with them since they live in the same city my university is located in. I help out with groceries and some monthly bills, but they don't charge me any rent. But even without paying rent, I basically have no disposable income.\n\nMy sister and her husband have 2 kids (11 & 7). They are great kids and I love them, but they can definitely be a handful. I have had to buy noise cancelling headphones because they can be so loud while I am trying to study. I don't particularly like kids and I'm definitely not the \"fun aunt.\" But I do love them and try to build a good relationship with them.\n\nNext Saturday is my BIL's corporate Xmas party. It's a huge party and his company splurges on hotel rooms for anyone who wants one. My sister and BIL were planning on getting a hotel room since they haven't had a date night in months. A couple of weeks ago they asked me if I could watch the kids while they go to the party, but this is crunch time for my classes before the end of the semester. I need to be spending as much time as possible studying, so I told them I couldn't do it. I could tell BIL wasn't happy, but I have to focus on my studies.\n\nI guess the other babysitter they found had to back out, so they are scrambling to find a replacement. My sister again asked me because they are struggling to find someone on short notice. I again told her that I can't because I need to study for my finals.

She agreed, but again, I could tell BIL was not happy about it.\n\nThings have been tense in the house since that talk.

Last night when I went into the kitchen to get some dinner, BIL told me he needs to talk to me.\n\nHe told me that since I view my staying with them as transactional, after this semester is finished, he wants to spend some time over my winter break putting together a formal rental agreement if I want to continue living with them. He said it will still be below market-value for rent, but that since I won't do favors for them, he's done doing favors for me.\n\nThis led to a big argument between SIS, BIL, and I.

He is not kicking you out in the middle of a semester and it sounds like you will get some say in what the rental agreement includes. He is also going to charge you below market rent. \n\nThe situation might be different if they were constantly expecting you to babysit for free. But this seems like a fairly rare occurrence and they tried to arrange a sitter. This was basically a one off favor.  \n\nWhy should this living arrangement only benefit you? You get free rent and they get, what? They are not petty for occasionally wanting the arrangement to be *mutually* beneficial. If you don't want them to ask you for the occasional favor, then a rental agreement makes sense for you too. The idea is to set clear expectations for both sides. \n\nAlso - her kids are 11 and 7. So you can absolutely continue to study while also keeping an eye on them. They are not babies or toddlers that need 100% of your attention.

She pretty much begged me and I told her the only way I would do it is if they paid me the same amount they would a normal sitter.\n\nSo you said you can't because you have to study but studying seems to take a backburner if they paid you.  You're living in there house rent free and barely contributing to things and the only thing they asked for you to do is keep the kids overnight.  The kids are not that young so what was the big deal.  Oh I know you wasn't getting paid first.\n\nYou're selfish and I don't blame your BIL.  Actually if it was me you wouldn't be coming back to my home period.  YTA", "YTA.  You either had time to babysit or you didn\u2019t because you had to study for finals.  Being paid to babysat did not change that fact.\n\nYour sister and her husband are doing you a huge favor and this is how you repay them?  I\u2019d be pissed off too if I was your BIL.  You want them to go out of their way for you but you can\u2019t be bothered to help them out because you are so self-centered and entitled.  Frankly, you are lucky if you don\u2019t get kicked out over this because there is no way I\u2019d continue to allow you to live in my home after this.\n\nFYI - I was a grad student once too and guess what?  I had a job the entire time and paid rent and bills.  I didn\u2019t sponge off of family members and whine about how hard it all was.  I was an adult and I sucked it up & got it done, just like millions of other grad students do every year.  Your attitude sucks.", "YTA - if you can\u2019t do it because of school, you can\u2019t do it. But you changed your mind and said oh, I have time if you pay me.\n\nYou are living with them rent free and pay for some groceries, which I assume you consume and some utilities that are probably higher becuase you are there. They are covering all the other expenses and providing you a place to live. It can be stressful having an additional person living with you. \n\nBIL may have been frustrated that you are there and this pushed him over the edge.", "YTA. The entitlement here on your part is just gross. If I were your sister and BIL you would be finding a new place to live and learn what the real world is like. Virtually no bills and $20K for the year has you running short! LOL!", "YTA, your reason for saying no was perfectly fine, but getting paid doesn't get you more study time. You are living there rent free and the parents tried to get a babysitter so were in a bind. Charging you less than market value rent in the future is still reasonable. You can use your babysitting money to pay for it.\n\nYou couldn't babysit for a good reason, getting paid doesn't fix your time crunch problem, so it seems you are unwilling to babysit because you don't want to. You are the one who wanted to turn it into a business arrangement. Turn about is fair play.", "YTA - and a lazy one at that. It is not hard to work while getting your masters. People do it every day. Grow up.\n\nEveryone else already told you it was dumb to request payment. I hope he does charge you rent and you have to get a job like the rest of us.", "YTA, its one thing to say you absolutely cannot babysit if you have valid reasons, but saying that you can do it but you refuse unless they pay you, when you're living with them for free is beyond ungrateful. I fully agree with your BIL, pay them rent or get out, it's not their problem you don't have money.", "YTA.  Doing some babysitting for free housing is the LEAST you could do.", "It sounds like this entitled woman would not even be able to go to school if not for her aunt and uncle, as getting a job is too difficult to go along with her \u201cvery difficult and demanding\u201c field of study.", "YTA. \nYou are living there RENT FREE. You can take a few hours off of studying to babysit. \nAlso, the fact that you make $20k, live rent free and hardly pay any bills and still don\u2019t have disposable income??", ">He told me that since I view my staying with them as transactional, after this semester is finished, he wants to spend some time over my winter break putting together a formal rental agreement if I want to continue living with them. He said it will still be below market-value for rent, but that since I won't do favors for them, he's done doing favors for me.\n\nWell, sounds like you bit the hand that fed you and found out the consequences. He\u2019s actually being a lot kinder than I\u2019d be - I\u2019d charge you full market rent (and in this market it\u2019s going to be crazy) or give you a month\u2019s notice to find a new place.\n\nYou\u2019re selfish and entitled and I\u2019m glad BIL is done being taken advantage of.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nI fully think its fine to say no.  I fully think its fine to ask to be paid for your time.  But to say you couldn't do it because of finals, but now its like \"well, if the price is right, then I really can\", just seems like not a great way to be with someone who is letting you stay rent free.  Like, apparently now you can get the studying done another time.  \n\nIf this was like a situation where you had to take off work to do this, and then you asked them to compensate for the work time, I'd agree much more.  But I guess damn the finals as long as you are getting paid.  \n\nTo me, it really comes down to the fact that they were letting you stay rent free.  You chose to make this a transaction even though they were helping you out, and now you are saying that THEY are petty for actually charging you below market rate.  Like somehow they are obligated to help you, but you don't need to help them in a pinch\n\nYou are acting very entitled here.", "Wow YTA. So many good reasons listed. \n\nLemme get this right- you get a $1,600 a month stipend, live rent free, and have no money? Where the hell is that money going? Even if you take out $200 for debt, $200 for whatever you\u2019re putting into housing, $100 for gas/ect, and $200 of FUN money, you should be putting roughly $900 into savings every month. \nCan I live with your sister? I\u2019ll babysit, clean, and cook in exchange for free housing. \n\nAlso- you\u2019re incredibly heckin privileged. 90% of college students work part or full time, even folks with demanding studies, while PAYING for rent, utilities, and other adult things. You\u2019re in for a very rude awakening, but luckily BIL is nice enough to make it a gentle awakening.", "YTA If you only have time to study then you should have stuck with that and apologized, saying that this is crunch time.\n\nYou made that whole claim about only having time to study and nothing else a joke by asking for money for babysitting. \n\nYou blew it. \n\nThey have probably been holding back any negative judgments about you not paying rent or helping out as you seemed to be totally dedicated to your studies and I guess they were willing to put up with things on their end to help you out in that way, thinking that at least you are doing what you say you are.\n\nIf you had stuck to studying you would have come out okay even if they weren't happy. If you had said that you're busy but you'll help them out as they're in a pinch you would have come out okay and they would have appreciated you cutting into your study time. Instead you took the one approach that made you look ungrateful, greedy, and a liar.", "YTA for being entitled and ungrateful. Taking a night away from studying won\u2019t cause your grades to drop significantly.\n\nYou not only treat sister and BIL like dirt, you\u2019re causing tension to their relationship too. You\u2019re beyond an ah.", "YTA, you live there rent free with no bother, but babysitting theyr children for a night should be payed? Wow you are entitled and ungrateful\nPlus, if you have no time coz you are studying, then you have no time. How is being payed will help your lack of time to study?", "Normally this would be a clear n t a but under the circumstances, given the huge favour they are doing you I honestly think it's not unreasonable of them to ask and I'm not surprised they're put out. If you want your incredibly good deal with them to continue I'd consider doing them a favour from time to time in kind. Otherwise get ready to pay rent. YTA", "You\u2019re getting free rent. They asked you to do a favour for one night and refused to unless paid. I would also start charging you rent since you don\u2019t see how much they already do for you. YTA", "Good. I\u2019ll even go further and hope BIL charge market rate. Like he said since it\u2019s all transactional for you, you\u2019ll have no issues paying. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You live there rent free. The least you could've done was babysit for one night. It's a few hours of your time.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't babysit because it's crunch time and you need to study for finals ... unless you can make money off the people letting you stay there for free?!? Then your crunch time isn't really so crunched, is it?", "YTA for all the reasons mentioned above.\n\nAdditionally, if you need a few extra hours to pass a class, you're probably not gonna pass that class. What have you been doing with your jobless time?", "You can\u2019t even do one night for them when you get to live there for free?! \n\nYTA and I doubt babysitting one evening will impact your studies. Kids that age don\u2019t need constant supervision either so you could still get studying done.", "YTA...first i thought oke your not but you are living there so it wouldn't even cost you any time it's just watching out in case of something happening . \nMy kids are the same age and they can handle themselves. \nYou can study and do everything you like.\n\nThat being said you can't babysit when there is no payment but with a payment it's no problem anymore and you don't need studying? \n\nYour bil is 100% right...what comes around goes around", "YTA.  It was ONE NIGHT, you live there for free, and if your schooling will fail because of ONE NIGHT, then you were already failing.", "YTA. They are letting you live with them rent free so the least you could do is help them out occasionally.  Now you get to pay rent or find somewhere else to live.", "YTA normally I would say N T A because of course you should get paid to babysit. But your original reason for refusal was time - which is completely understandable! But suddenly you can magically do it if they pay you?! They aren\u2019t babies and shouldn\u2019t require much care. Heck, an 11yo is almost old enough to stay home without supervision. They basically just needed someone in the house for safety. You could have made it clear that they couldn\u2019t disturb you except for an emergency and studied while they watched a movie. You make sure they get to bed and then keep studying. You get free rent and couldn\u2019t do this favor? Definitely the asshole.", "YTA- you are the one who brought money into this. I was totally on your side- ok, babysitting during finals could be problematic to your success in those finals.  But how would getting paid change that? It doesn't, it just means that you took their desperation as an opportunity to extort them without any consideration to the benefits you are already getting.\n\nMy advice is to apologize, eat a giant serving of humble pie, admit that you shouldn't have asked for money as it had no bearing on your ability to make your grades and then just say- by way of explanation- I'm stressed because of finals and the timing isn't good, so I stressed more and then reacted to all of it poorly. Maybe you can unfuck this, but you better be humble and sincere and get over yourself.", "YTA. \n\nYou expected to have free rent but won't do your own sister a favor and watch her kids for one night without being paid for it. If you added up how much you would have owed them in rent had they charged you, and how much that one night of babysitting would cost them, what do you think the difference would be? \n\nYou definitely shot yourself in the foot on this one. They have every right to ask for rent.", "YTA, You are living there rent free and being ungrateful\u2026BIL is right if you want money to babysit they should get money for rent.  You aren\u2019t a child forced to babysit siblings, you\u2019re an adult and need to pull your weight in a household.", "YTA. They are letting you live with them for free! If you can\u2019t work because of studies then you shouldn\u2019t take many classes so you can work and pay for yourself. They asked you for one favor and you are being the ah. You could have taken one night off studying to help them. This is your fault and you are lucky they don\u2019t kick you out and see how the real work is.", "Slight YTA. Most grad students can take a break for 2-3 hrs. \n\nYou could have offered to watch them but in a limited way because you had to study, like do a movie night and take out pizza. The kids would be busy and you could study in the living room. \n\nAnd then watch them for a longer time after the exams.", "YTA.\n\nLet me get this straight; your sister and BIL are gracious enough to do you a favor 365 days a year, and you can\u2019t do a favor in return for one day?\n\nYour family is letting you live with them for practically nothing; yet you are so entitled you have the audacity to complain in this post about the kids? God forbid you have to purchase noise canceling headphones, so the kids can behave like children in their own house. How inconvenient?\n\nYour excuse for not babysitting was flimsy to begin with; but you then show it for the bullshit it was by asking for money when your family\u2019s other arrangements fell through. If taking one partial evening/morning off to study is going to cause you to fail, you either slacked off all semester, shouldn\u2019t be in this field of study (as you aren\u2019t comprehending), or have extremely poor time management skills.\n\nBy your admission; your sister and BIL haven\u2019t had a date night/break in months, telling us your rarely babysit/help out. If my family was letting me live with them for next to nothing, I would do all I could to assist in other ways. Actually, I would be offering myself up at least one night a month to babysit(who cares if kids are not my thing). The fact they even have to ask is ridiculous.\n\nAlso, what on earth are you spending $1,600 a month on when your only living expenses are some monthly bills and some groceries? Why on earth do you not have at least some pocket money?\n\nYou have been acting selfishly and taking advantage of your sister and BIL. It is the height of entitlement to be angry at them for wanting to make the arrangement more formal/fair to them; after they have finally accepted that you are ungrateful and will only help out the bare minimum you can get away with. \n\nAnd they still aren\u2019t going to charge you full price on rent. You should be glad they aren\u2019t throwing you out. I kind of wish they would, so that you would have to juggle a job/roommates/higher living expenses so you can get some perspective on just how much they have done for you.", "I would have originally said N T A due to you needing to study, however, YTA for accepting money in place of studying like money is going to help you with your finals. \n\nYour justification for refusing to babysit went out the window when you could be bought with a price.", "If you had just said no cause it was crunch time for your finals that would be one thing.

Normally, I would say that free babysitting is something that you should be expected to provide if you\u2019re living there for free, but in this situation you had already said no for good reasons.

You know you are the AH so why come here to ask?\n\nMy lord your sister probably just want to have sex with her husband without you and the kids around but you can't do her a solid.", "NTA - if you did not agree when you first moved in that you would babysit for free then you are under no obligation to do so. This is the hard part about living with family for free they will always want more from you. You should find another place to live as I don't think you are safe living with your Brother-in-law.", "NTA\n\nI understand why BIL may be mad but I feel like he refuses to show understanding for you. Expecting you to jeapordize your study and future career to take care of their kids while they're partying because you live with them seems wrong. It's like they took you in because they expect something in return and not to help you. However, if possible maybe find some roommates and move out cause it obviously isn't working anymore and your stay is causing issues in your sister and BIL's relationship", "NTA because you do help with groceries and some of the bills.  When your BIL tells you how much rent will be I hope he takes that into account.  \n\n\nYou might have to drop some classes next semester and get a job so you can move out.  \"Free\" stuff always come at a price.  TINSTAAFL", "NTA.   \nIf they expected a governess when they let you move in, they should've been paying you.   \nStrongly suggest doing as much studying as possible out of the house, at the library for example. Same thing as working from home; people don't seem to understand that you can be at home physically but still busy.", "Unpopular opinion but if the babysitting wasn\u2019t included in the free rent clause, then it shouldn\u2019t be part of the conversation. If you do someone a favor and expect them to repay you, then you should make a contract.", "Ha ha. Nice post.", "You said exactly what I was thinking. When I read the title, I thought that OP was being used all the time, and she had to put her foot down. \n\nBut in this case, I agree entirely with BIL.

YTA", "20k/year with no rent expenses and \"helping with groceries\" is a pretty sweet living situation.\n\nIt's possible that all goes to tuition, but it sounds like she would have mentioned it if that was the case.\n\nYTA\n\nThey are doing you a huge, huge favour and you couldn't return a small one. \n\nOf course they don't want you rent free anymore. Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes.", "Lol, love this line: \u201cYou can use your babysitting money to pay for it\u201d! Spot on, you happy now OP?", "Hysterical.  I hadn\u2019t thought of this.", "But she does have money! 20k a year is pretty nice pocket change if you aren't paying rent.", "Seriously, if someone was paying to keep a roof over my head I\u2019d be beyond grateful and do everything I could to contribute in other ways so I wasn\u2019t a burden\u2026this woman has no shame mooching.", "I would take it a step further and say that she still should\u2019ve babysat, even if it came at the expense of her grades.  they have been subsidizing her education this entire time; so she would still be better off overall.", "But either OP needs that time for studying or not. Putting a price tag (at babysitting rates) on that time puts the lie to that.", "BIL can stick to his guns and say bye.  Her grades will suck even worse if she hast to get a full-time job and pay for her own living expenses. She absolutely should babysit, even if her grades suffer. It\u2019s much better than the alternative.", "Then how is it NAH? OP is TA because she wants free rent and to be paid for babysitting.", "It seems like OP wants more from her family than what you\u2019re saying\n\nOP gave almost nothing to sister and BIL family while taking everything", "I agree that one of the drawbacks of living off someone for free is that they might occasionally want something in return.", "SAFE?! Lololol!", "If taking time off from studying for a night will lead to failing the entire year or out of school, there won\u2019t be anyone graduating anywhere. Nonsense", "I mean, it didn't seem like there was an expectation for this to be often.  It was one time in a pinch when their sitter cancelled.  And she had notice.  She apparently had time to do it if she was paid, which is not what she originally said.", "Agreed!  I work at a University and almost all of our grad students have jobs", "Agreed which is why she should have stuck to her guns.", "Because, going strictly by the question about asking to be paid for babysitting, I do not think OP is an AH. The request alone is not unreasonable.", "OP said she helps with groceries and some of the bills. Doesn't sound like she's just freeloading.", "You don't know OP's situation. She said she is spending so much studying she can't even get a part time job so maybe she has several tests and has to study for one of them one night and the other one other night", "I would say there was from BIL since he was so upset when she first said no. He felt entitled to her time", "\u2026 and not doing so is where OP became an AH.", "It\u2019s unreasonable when she\u2019s living in a house rent free.", "She isn't paying rent, and is contributing to groceries she is eating, and utilities which she is using.  That is no where near paying actual rent.  And then they are mad that she may have to pay actual rent that is below market?", "If she can\u2019t handle one evening of not studying, then she certainly can\u2019t handle a PhD or whatever job she plans to get when finishing grad school.", "But all of a sudden she had time if she got paid. Paid by the people in whose house she\u2019s living in rent free.", "I mean, if you are living somewhere rent free and they ask you for help 1 time in 5 months, yeah, I can see why that would piss someone off.  \n\nIt would be like if my friend let me use his car anytime he liked, but then the one time he asked me to help him do some yardwork I said no.  Yeah, i can see being upset with that.", "That's like saying it's unreasonable for older siblings to want to be paid to watch their younger ones. If free babysitting had been a part of the arrangement when they had OP move in, that would be one thing. But that is not what happened.", "When people switch to other analogies, it means they don\u2019t have an actual argument. But I will happily address your example:\n\n1.  Children are legally entitled to room and board with their parents until age 18. \n\n2.  So if they are under 18 they are not obligated to babysit.  \n\n3.  If they are still living in the home after 18, then there is a moral obligation since they are living there rent free.\n\n4.  There is no \u201carrangement\u201c here. An arrangement implies mutual benefits.  The OP\u2019s aunt and uncle have allowed her to live with them as an act of kindness.  \n\n5.  If the OP wants to be paid for her services, then her Aunt and Uncle want to be paid for use of their home.", "If the \u201colder sibling\u201d is over 18, lives at home rent-free, and normally never has to babysit?  Then yeah - it\u2019s unreasonable to want to be paid for a one-time favor.", ">When people switch to other analogies, it means they don\u2019t have an actual argument.\n\nFunny, analogies are pretty often used to clarify a point lol. But sure. \n\n>So if they are under 18 they are not obligated to babysit.\n\nDo you not know how being a kid works? So some 15-year-old is just going to be able to say \"no\" to their parents if they don't agree to pay them?\n\n>There is no \u201carrangement\u201c here. An arrangement implies mutual benefits. The OP\u2019s aunt and uncle have allowed her to live with them as an act of kindness.\n\nHow does the word \"arrangement\" imply that? That's nowhere in the definition of the word. Yes, they were kind enough to allow OP to not pay rent. \n\n>If the OP wants to be paid for her services, then her Aunt and Uncle want to be paid for use of their home.\n\nHun, this was literally my central point. I don't know why you are coming so hard at me about....agreeing with you but using different words? About having an opinion slightly different from yours?\n\nI think the main difference is that you seem to think that being kind is transactional; that if you do someone a favor, then they are morally obligated to just do whatever you say. That's really how you're coming off here. If you give money to a homeless person, are they morally obligated to come wash your car? If you give someone a 3000% tip at a restaurant, are they morally obligated to be in some weird TikTok clout-grab?", "\n\n\u201cFunny, analogies are pretty often used to clarify a point lol. But sure.\u201d\n\n1.  That\u2019s because they don\u2019t know how to articulate their point and so they use some other examples that generally deflect from the actual argument.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you not know how being a kid works? So some 15-year-old is just going to be able to say \"no\" to their parents if they don't agree to pay them?\u201d\n\n2.  This comment actually proves what I just said in number one. We are now talking about the dynamics of a child babysitting her siblings instead of the situation in the OP. \n\nBut you\u2019re the one who brought up that example. You weren\u2019t talking about what is enforceable but rather what is reasonable. It is unreasonable to force a child to babysit her younger siblings; that doesn\u2019t mean lots of parents don\u2019t do it anyway.\n\n\n\u201cHow does the word \"arrangement\" imply that? That's nowhere in the definition of the word. Yes, they were kind enough to allow OP to not pay rent.\u201d\n\n3.  Again, your word. You said that babysitting was never discussed in the \u201carrangement,\u201d which implies something that is binding.  I\u2019m honestly not sure how one would ever use the word without implying some sort of a mutual exchange.\n\n\n\u201cHun, this was literally my central point. I don't know why you are coming so hard at me about....agreeing with you but using different words? About having an opinion slightly different from yours?\u201d\n\n4. Laying out my argument in logical points is considered \u201ccoming at you hard\u201c?\n\n\u201cthink the main difference is that you seem to think that being kind is transactional; that if you do someone a favor, then they are morally obligated to just do whatever you say. That's really how you're coming off here. If you give money to a homeless person, are they morally obligated to come wash your car? If you give someone a 3000% tip at a restaurant, are they morally obligated to be in some weird TikTok clout-grab?\u201d\n\n5.  I think an ongoing situation where someone is living in the home for free goes beyond merely \u201cbeing kind.\u201c In any case, they have every right to expect assistance when they are giving their own so freely. Call it what you want. The rest of that nonsense about tips and homeless people is irrelevant.  It\u2019s yet another example of pointless analogies that only deflect from the actual discussion."]}
