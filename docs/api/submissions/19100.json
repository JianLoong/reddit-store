I\u2019m confused on the timeline.", "It sounds like from your post you just demanded he do the housework immediately and got angry when he said no? In that case, YTA. Diablo 4 didn't officially release until June 5th and you mention this was days ago, meaning your partner and all his friends spent extra money in order to get the more expensive, early-access version of the game, not to mention lined up all their schedules, in order to be able to play it together at that time. The housework can wait a bit, just let him do it later.", "YTA. Maybe it was him that didn't communicate properly or you,  but he bought a pre-release of the game with his friends, so he and his friends payed extra $$$ to be able to play it before everyone could. So his side should be understood as yes, it's a \"special occasion \", and not just another day of gaming. If he didn't communicate properly it could sound like any other day, and I'd take your side, but in this particular case, no.", "Info: did him and his friends have these plans made ahead of time? For she typically help with the chores, whether asked or not? \n\nOf so, I\u2019m gonna say YtA. You wanted him to drop his already made plans with hitch is kind of a shitty thing to do. \nIf they weren\u2019t made ahead of time and he just wanted to get out of cleaning then I\u2019d say NTA.", "YTA\n\nHe had time set aside for this, and he paid extra for it, so I'm going to assume that he talked about it ahead of time. He has a hobby that he enjoys, and rather than respecting that and setting reasonable expectations, and boundaries, you expected him to simply set everything down the moment you demand he does and do what you want. Then you ran off to hide in your parent's house. You could have let him start the game, play a while, then help you. That is reasonable. Expecting him to ditch plans with his friends because you're in a bad mood is not reasonable. Nor is running off when you don't get your way.", "Well, normally I'd say NTA from looking at the title. But after reading the rest of your post, I'd say YTA. You didn't ask him to help with housework. It sounds like at the last minute, you asked him to do all the housework because you were tired and it was shark week. And, it turns out he had plans, because that game just came out and was early access\u2014which your bf paid extra for.\n\nYes, I get that you probably think videogames are stupid. But your bf likes them. You shouldn't view them as any less legitimate than your own hobbies. Do you think shark week is objectively less of a waste of time than videogames?\n\nEven worse, you make a habit of always doing the housework\u2014not because your bf neglects to do it when you ask, but because you \"enjoy doing it alone.\" Then, all of the sudden, you want him to do it all. Right that second. And he was busy, because why shouldn't be?\n\nIt would be one thing if he was repeatedly neglecting his responsibilities for videogames. And it's totally valid for you to decide that you're too tired/busy to do it that night. But, in my opinion, it is extremely irrational to (1) create the expectation that you will always be doing the housework; (2) randomly decide that you're too tired/busy to do it; AND (3) decide that the housework you usually do must get done this minute (by your bf), then get mad that he is busy. It really seems like you hate videogames and went out of your way to trick him and make him look like an ass.\n\nI've got an idea: instead of always doing all the housework, you two should create a chore list. People have different definitions of \"clean,\" and when the disparity is big enough, it creates tension in relationships. Then, you both know what you have to do, and you can both plan around it. This will prevent this from happening in the future, because of something doesn't get done, you know who is at fault.", "Daily housework, what is it? \n\nI asked because it seem like it something that personally bothers you but Is inconsequential to him. \n\nI mean I took a week off work when Elden ring (Game) came out.", "YTA why does he need to do the housework 'right now', his plans are just as important as yours.", "New game, let him enjoy it with his friends.\nNAH", "NTA.

My house stays clean if I pick up after myself as I go and don\u2019t leave messes behind.", "NTA\n\nAs much as I wish gaming all day was possible, housework takes priority generally. Your partner should have been more understanding and sucked it up.", "NTA. He should be helping, always. I get where he's coming from given that you normally put up with his laziness, and especially if he had specific plans, it sounds like that was the wrong day for that fight, but that doesn't change the fact that he is a lazy AH and needs to help with normal household chores", "NTA, \n\nLove video games myself, and the desire to play a game as soon as it comes out is a really strong pull. Having said that, video games should never get in the way of other things. He should\u2019ve been a supportive boyfriend, helped then go back to playing afterword. He lacks maturity. Honestly consider if this is what you want in a relationship. Cuz video games are going to keep coming out and his attitude might be the same when thy happens if he doesn\u2019t fix it", "You don't say your ages in the post and it seems like you've forgotten how hard it is to get a group of people together for anything. Out of curiosity why did the chores have to be done at that time? Did he just sit down to play? Nothing about the chores seemed urgent. It only seemed to make you anxious and I can't understand why they couldn't just wait to be done. Your anxiety is a you problem. If you can't stand the house at its current state I would suggest some therapy to understand why it's such a problem for you. He shouldn't have to ease your anxiety. It honestly feels like a power play because you knew this was coming out soon. He's probably been talking about it for awhile like most people do when they're excited for something. YTA", "YTA\n\nIf you have been paying attention to your bf then you will know this game released for general purchase yesterday. So if he was playing it days ago he and his friends paid extra and put effort into Co-ordinating their game time.\n\nYou either do not pay attention to what\u2019s important to him or you did pay attention and tried a shit test on him to see if he would abandon plans important to him in order to pander to you.\n\nThen when he wouldn\u2019t you found a way to fuck up his evening anyway.\n\nSounds to me like he\u2019s not the only one playing games.", "OP, the problem is that you generally set the bar too low for him. Good for you if you enjoy housework, but since you're both working, chores should be distributed equally. \n\nNow let's say you both have your equal amount of chores to take care of. He could then have told you that on day X a new game comes out and he has a date with his friends to play etc. He could have traded his chores for that day with you, or he could have suggested to order food instead of cooking, or to clean up before work, etc.  But it seems he just took it for granted that you will do the work anyway. And then he got angry with you because for once you weren't able to pick up the slack and it happened to be on his Diabolo date.\n\nHave an honest conversation with him about the domestic work load. Make sure you both put in equal effort and have equal time for hobbies. Stay strong! NTA", "YTA. I have been waiting for an extremely long time for the release of this game. He likely had these plans with his friends for a while, and you last minute hit him with doing all of the housework. If he is playing with the early access, then he specifically spent more money on that. \n\nHe reasonably could have done some more to help you out, but asking him to do all of it is a bit rude if you aren't seriously ill.", "NTA.", "NTA.

NTA, ask him to do better", "NTA.\n\nYour husband needs a reality check.  You already give him so much time to play games.  Maybe you should split up the housework more equitably and make it clear that you are not his maid.\n\nWhat happens if you have kids?

You shouldn\u2019t be doing all the chores all the time. He needs to help.\nI\u2019m a gamer myself and you bet my loved ones come before my hobby.

I've been playing it since the early release \ud83d\ude04 But I also still cook, clean, work, and sleep. Adulting isn't a part time thing. Honestly you messed up by not setting an expectation that housework should be shared in the relationship period. NTA", "So, it may look to you like 'just playing games' but actually your BF had a social event planned with other people - equivalent (for non-nerds) to making plans to go out to meet people at a bar or similar. It's a scheduled event and they do it together at a particular time.\n\nYou suddenly came to him and said 'honey, I suddenly don't want to do the thing I normally do myself and prefer it that way, and which isn't particularly urgent except that it makes me a bit anxious, can you do it instead of doing the big important thing you planned to do with your friends, and which I have made it clear to you I don't understand or care about'. \n\nWhen he said no, you made apparently zero effort to understand, then went nuclear by leaving the house. I'm sure for you that it felt like he was dismissing your anxiety so he could scratch his belly button, but you genuinely did ask him to cancel his long-awaited concert tickets to clean the coffee table, and you wouldn't even countenance the possibility that he wasn't... lying? exaggerating? IDK how you interpreted that? Sounds like you just don't think anything involving games can be a real event? when he explained that fact. Anxiety is a real and serious thing but when you and your BF are unable to communicate because your anxiety is driving the bus, then (shock horror it's AITA I'm going to suggest) you probably both need to think about getting some therapy. \n\nThat said, you also need to stop doing the housework for both of you. You need to come up with a reasonable schedule you can both stick to.", "He needs to grow up!", "YTA Unless you have kids, as neglect is never ok, the beginning of a new game is important to gamers.

People have been waiting for D4 for years, this is a huge release for Diablo fans. \n\nYou wanted housework done. Nothing was on fire, it wasn\u2019t urgent.

I would make sure to check into the age of the person that you are living with via ID or birth certificate. If this person is of appropriate age then you should create a chore list that is fair and balanced.

Ask yourself how long your can put up with this.", "I\u2019m leaning ESH. That\u2019s based on a few things:\n\n1. It seems he didn\u2019t communicate to you very well that this was a pre-arranged period of time where we wouldn\u2019t be available to help you out (at least not right away). He should have made things clear so he could stay on top of things with you or arrange to leave a few of the chores that could wait until later in the day when he takes a break or before bed.\n\n2. It being a video game is no different to a camping/fishing trip, race meet, or other hobby. If your BF was out on a track day he\u2019d been looking forward to for several years, he and his friends had altered their schedules, and they\u2019d all paid a premium to go a couple of days early, you wouldn\u2019t call him back suddenly to do housework.\n\n3. It sounds like he needs to help out more in general. Why if you\u2019re both working do you do all the housework?\n\n4. You overreacted spectacularly. He\u2019s right that you\u2019re being an ass.
