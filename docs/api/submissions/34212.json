This started as a way to celebrate my grandfather's birthday, and although now he is no longer with us it is a tradition we have continued. I have two sisters, my older sister 'Lottie' (35f) and my younger sister 'Olive' (23f). Lottie has a daughter 'Rosey' (4f) from a previous marriage, and her husband has three children (8f, 10m, 12f). While she only married her husband in March, they have been together for a couple of years so her stepchildren have come to family stuff before. While she is a very involved grandmother, my mother has never considered Lottie's stepchildren to be part of the family.\n\nA few days before we were supposed to meet up for the fair, my mother messaged the family group chat to tell us she had booked us a table at a restaurant, but she had not booked enough places for my sister's stepchildren, and had only booked Rosey in to see Santa. Lottie was upset with this and wanted the booking to be changed, but my mother refused. She thought her stepchildren should spend the day with their mother, or Lottie's husband could stay home with them, as this tradition was for family only.\n\nSo, my sister decided not to go with my mother. She and her husband decided on a different day to attend the fair with all of their children.\n\nHere is where I may be the asshole. Lottie asked me and Olive to go with her too, to reinforce to my mother that her stepchildren were part of the family and should be included in family activities. While I agree with the sentiment, the date she chose was a day when I already had plans with my girlfriend. Lottie asked me to cancel my plans as this outing was more important, which I disagreed with as my girlfriend was going away with her family for Christmas/New Years so this would be the last time I saw her for three weeks.\n\nI stuck to my plans and spent the day with my girlfriend. Lottie still went with her husband and their children, my mother went with some friends and Olive, and I thought everything was fine.\n\nHowever, Lottie completely blanked us when we tried to arrange plans for New Year's, and when she did eventually reply she told us she was spending it with the family that '*cared enough to stick up for her*'. She is especially angry that I chose my girlfriend '*over my family'* and that Olive still went with our mother. I had not expected this to turn into a big issue, she gave me little notice and I do not think I was unreasonable for not wanting to cancel my plans, but I think given my mother's attitude this meant a lot more to her than I initially thought.

You had a prior engagement and, regardless of the meaning and motivation behind the choice she made to do things on a separate day to stick it to your mother, it's ridiculous of her to have expected you to bail on someone else just to have her back. You showed vocal support for her decision and, if it really meant that much to her, she could've easily worked with you to find a day where you were all free so you could do that together.", "INFO: Did you ever say to your mother that her exclusions are cruel? Is anyone in the family sticking up *verbally* for Lottie and confronting mom?", "NTA.\n\nLottie's plans were simply in conflict with your preexisting arrangements. Your support of her and all the kids in the family didn't need to be demonstrated by compliance like it was a make-up test day at school. )Besides, your mom not being present would not actually result in her \"seeing\" you and your siblings demonstrating absolute solidarity anyway. Who was the show for? Your mom wasn't invited and she's the one who started this whole unnecessary and cruel debacle in the first place.)\n\nSo, I agree with you not attending the dinner your mom planned to exclude your sister's kids.

I don't think it was totally fair for Lottie to try to rope you into her boycott of your mother's plan to make a point. I'm sure she would have loved the unified message that would send, but for more reasons than one, it didn't work out. I don't think you should have thrown other plans out in order to attend her event at the fair. \n\nI do think it would have been good for you and Olive to reiterate to your mother that her treatment of her step-grandchildren is unfair, unbecoming, and well out of the spirit of the holiday. To Lottie, you probably come across as trying to be neutral in the face of unfair treatment. She is looking for more support, but it really shouldn't be about choosing sides. I do think your mother needs to be put on a bit of a blast for operating this way with Lottie's stepkids. It is hurtful and exclusionary, not to mention presumptive - in co-parenting / split custody arrangements, the scheduling is often complex and rigid, and it's not as easy as just 'send the kids to be with their mother'. Your mom should do better.", "NTA \n\nI think you made it clear you were on Lottie's side by not attending with your mother. Your other sister is the problem. Lottie should have accepted that you already had plans on the day she chose. \n\nLottie is right. They are a blended family and all those children should be treated like grandchildren. If your mother can't do that, she is going to lose out on a relationship with Rosey. \n\nMake plans to do something with Lottie and her family to make up for missing the outing. Forgive her because she's just extra sensitive right now.", "NTA. You had plans, and stuck to them.

I actually **like** them more than some of the other nieces/nephews.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, as a mother of bio and stepkids, I am nc with my family because after so many times of being told my stepkids are not part of the family and no one would stand up for them, I was done and walked away. So, I mean I feel for your sister and hurt for her. My husbands family is way more loving, supportive and loathes my family for their lack of well being anything but decent. We all gotta live with choices. She also should not have said the same about your partner, but it sounds like there is a lot of lack of communication and she may feel like everyone is more on moms side vs supporting her.", "NTA\n\nWhile your sister has a point that she's making with your mom, that doesn't mean you have to drop your plans with your GF who is leaving for 3 weeks.

My only other guess is maybe she already told the children about the family trip that year and wanted some family to be there, but I imagine 'the others can't make it so we're going ourselves this year' is just as easy to explain as 'the others can't make it so we're changing the date and grandmother isn't coming this year'.
