He\u2019s just coming off as annoyed that he lost\u2026\n\nEdit: reading the other comments I realise I could be totally out of touch here not knowing anything about the community", "Sounds more like a modernism vs trad thing. He probably would have been fine with you writing the positions down.\n\nBut maybe he's just a sore loser, hard to tell. I'd NAH this.", "NTA even if it was to say you won a game of chess who cares. It's not that your mocking and teasing this person for losing.", "NTA, I think neither of you were in the wrong here, it's okay to be proud of your accomplishments but I also understand how your colleague might have felt a bit embarrassed. \nI don't think that makes you an asshole", "INFO\n> game I mentioned [...] while he\u2019s been playing for decades. \n\nThis sounds like you were the one saying he's been playing for decades. Is that what happened, or just bad phrasing?", "NTA. It\u2019s fairly commonplace to record victories in chess with a photo. Your coworkers were AHs for implying you did so to keep a record of your kill.", "NTA.\n\nMans living in a generation gap.\n\nPeople take pics of *everything* these days. It's not weird in the slightest you wanted to take a pic of that", "NTA! He was so embarrassed that he lost, he\u2019s immature and has bad sportsmanship. It was clear you are just trying to become a better player.", "NTA. You're trying to learn more about how the game is played. There's nothing wrong with that.", "I'm going with NAH. If I were in his shoes, I too would assume you were taking the picture to brag about it later, probably post it somewhere.", "I... Im at a loss. \n\nCompetitive chess can be *HEAVILY* nuanced in what they see as poor form or poor conduct.\n\n It IS poor form to have any electronics at the table by my understanding, in competitive chess, and you would thereby be unable to do as you said and take a picture...so perhaps it's an unspoken extension seeing as it would *be* impossible to do? \n\nBut then... this was in his *office*, not an official event so...it's weird. He might expect the same decorum but a person not on that circuit wouldn't understand. \n\nNAH. Maybe reach out personally and just ask if this is something expected and understood among chess players, and if so you are sorry you didn't know this and meant no offense. If for nothing than to keep the office peace if you wish.\n\nEdit for whatever my phone just did to a sentence up there lol", "NTA. He is just butt hurt.", "NTA. He is a Sore loser. Especially if u figure out a way out the bind.\n\nThe optics look like a sore winner - but the specifics detail someone learning and growing", "NTA\n\nOdd reaction. Don\u2019t see why it would be inappropriate to take a photo of the board. Especially for study/practice, which seems pretty ordinary to me. \n\nCongratulations on learning chess so well. I\u2019ve tried, and while I know the mechanics of the game, the actual skill eludes me.", "AITA? To me this is a MAYBE. I can see where others will say no because you offered to shake his hand at the end of the game. On the other hand, you stopped to take what may have seemed like a trophy photo (ref. - a record of my kill).", "NTA. It makes a lot of sense that you'd want to study the situation to see if there was a way to get out of it.", "NTA ..... unless this is some sort of chess rule? Football coaches and players watch back their plays to see where they went wrong or what they could have done better. Also, I would have been excited and shocked of how well I did and wanted to show off to my friends and that's okay too. The only way you'd be an ah in my eyes is if you were taunting him while taking the picture.", "NTA\n\nYour colleague is a sore loser.", "NTA. Sorry I'm also a female poc and the way people undermine our intelligence on the regular is fkn annoying. He was clearly that way and he evidently gets a false sense of confidence from it. He discovered he was wrong. You're proud of your achievement and wanted to enjoy it, which you have every right to do.\n\nIt might be that he feels insecure but he needs to say that with adult language instead of making things up - \"classless\" etc. Personally, I would tell him his response is poor form, childish and classless and that if he cannot conduct himself like an adult instead of like a sore loser, he should keep the chessboard at home and stick to bingo. I hate this type of entitled, arrogant, sexist man and he is in every workplace, so I'm happy to destroy but perhaps you're kinder than I am.", "NAH. Millennial and Gen X differences in values and view of technology, which led to this particular \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d.\n\nMillennials grew up with the major advancements in technology. It is second nature to have your phone on you at all times and she wanted a memory of this game that she was proud of herself for winning. The access to memories today is right at our fingertips. \n\nGen X are not as tech savvy, view technology as a learned skill. Technology is more of a way to keep up with the news and current events, and they still prefer traditional media sources like tv and radio.  \n\nHis thoughts when she took a picture of the board were probably along the lines of- disdain for the millennial generation with their constant need for tech at their fingertips and/or thinking she is purposefully being cocky and probably slightly arrogant towards him. Plus he\u2019s definitely salty about losing to someone who is much younger and 1/10 of the experience.\n\n\nSource: someone who has never played a game of chess in her life", "NAH.  It would have been polite to ask before taking the pic.  He\u2019s been playing for decades, has a board in his office and just lost to a relative newcomer.  Empathy would have been good.  On the other hand he overreacted.  If he can\u2019t take losing, to anyone, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t play.", "YTA. There doesn't seem to be any good reason to do this.", "NAH- you want to learn the game and it's understandable that a photo is a lot easier than writing down every position. But at the same time it's a casual game and taking a photo can seem like you wanted some kind of trophy, like when you take picture with a big fish you just caught so you can brag to your friends.", "YTA.

I told him/them I started playing during the pandemic.

For a long time, casual chess, at least where you'd be part of a club, would have had similar concepts for competitive chess. \n\nIf you wanted to recreate a board, you'd have used a notebook to record each play throughout the game. Phones weren't nearly as accessible, and to learn from a chess-game you're much better off following the whole game anyway so the thought process stays on the track of \"why would you even want to do that when you should know to write down the game as you go\".\n\nThat also means that the fact the OP laughed at the bad joke a bystander made, rather than correcting them immediately - kind of emphasizes the gaucheness.", "She gave a very good reason, I thought, which was to practice using the same layout later", "About two years of anecdotal evidence? I could go on and on, but I think the demeaning language he used to \u201ceducate\u201d me on the sophisticated nuances of lunchtime chess (the game I just beat him at) would imply he views me as inferior.

As a female POC myself, I can vouch that sometimes there are people that talk down to us and treat us differently to our white counterparts. It's like they do it just enough to make us uncomfortable, but not enough to warrant us talking about it or taking action against it.\n\nShe didn't call him racist anyway. She simply said she feels he resents her. Micro aggressions exist.\n\nEDIT: Okay I'll admit it was implied in the post that she thinks he's racist, but I still stand by my point about micro aggressin against POC", ">OP laughed at the bad joke a bystander made, rather than correcting them immediately\n\nI kinda made a face at this too, but nervous laughter is a thing that I tried to keep in mind. Some people are just so SO bad at even that slight level of confrontation. That's why I opted NAH. There's a lot of considerations at play that could really just make this all a big misunderstanding.\n\nGood point on the generational call as well. We still occasionally giggle at the \"you won't always have a calculator\" comment our teachers made in school. Look at us now, we *always* have a calculator, and not just a basic one but one that can pretty much solve anything. It can be a lot \ud83e\udd23", "I didn't say she called him a racist. I said she implied it. The only reason she includes is she is a poc and he is conservative. The implication is obvious", "Okay, fair point. Either way micro aggressions are incredibly common towards POC"]}
