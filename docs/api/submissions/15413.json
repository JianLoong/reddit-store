For a long time, casual chess, at least where you'd be part of a club, would have had similar concepts for competitive chess. \n\nIf you wanted to recreate a board, you'd have used a notebook to record each play throughout the game.

Either way micro aggressions are incredibly common towards POC", "No one is the AH here.  It\u2019s different mindsets and, possibly, generational gaps.\n\nI play competitive and recreational chess.

Different etiquette, different adherence to rules.\n\nYour colleague is older and has played for years and is probably interpreting the situation in a different manner.\n\nYou are studying the art and coming at it from a different perspective.  What offended him, presumably as a strict observer of competitive etiquette, is a mere learning tool to you.  Completely different viewpoints- both valid.\n\nWe\u2019re all different and unique.\n\nJust have an honest conversation with him.  There\u2019s no disrespect.  Just a difference of opinion.  If he\u2019s mature and reasonable, he should understand chess in a competitive setting isn\u2019t the same thing as chess in a social setting.  If he doesn\u2019t understand that the way you process information is different, it\u2019s on him.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t even have a chessboard for impromptu games if he only wants to follow strict chess etiquette.

I think it's improper etiquette, especially after he mentioned it out loud to you that he didn't want you to.

The fact that you waited till your opponent got upset makes it look like you came up with some random excuse to make you not look bad. You did something, got called put, then back tracked. That's what it looks like happened.", "I'd say a soft AH. Recording moves is standard practice in chess, and that's the way to go over options and possibilities post-game for evaluation and learning. Taking a pic of the end alone does look like trophy hunting.", "This is quite difficult to rate because you added pointless details that hold zero weight in the story. Why does your coworker's political standpoint matter? How does your assumption that he resents you factor into this game?\n\n\nHonestly? It makes me think you provided those \"facts\" so people would side with you quicker. The whole vide is \"I'm a young woman that got a crushing win over the right wing old man!\"\n\n\nI will also add you taking out your phone and snapping a picture is shitty. AND only because you didn't say anything until after you laughed at his expense. Which seems even worse as he showed you basic respect by shaking your hand.", "NTA, sore looser. I play a lot of chess, mainly against computers to be fair, but it's pretty standard in official chess tournaments to record the entire game by writing down every move, exactly for the purposes of seeing what could have been done differently. I've played people like this, who think it'll be an easy win but then get beat.", "YTA, colleague welcomes you into his office to play chess.

There\u2019s even a website you can go to that will show you statistics on these moves like how many times they\u2019ve happened in the history of chess. This is ridiculous.", "NTA, but also kind of depends... do you normally take pictures of your games afterwards to go over them again with your bf?\n\nIt also depends on the vibe of the game, but I bet if the situation had been reversed where he took a pic after beating you, people would be reacting differently here.  If I'm competing with someone in some casual game, I'm definitely not documenting it afterwards, that seems pretty tacky unless there's a certain rapport with that person.", "NAH.", "NTA because I assume you would have also taken the picture if you\u2019d lost to do the same thing.", "NTA and \"classless\" is a dogwhistle.

I don't think you actually meant that, but it comes across that way and I could see him thinking that especially since he hadn't played you before.  He had no basis for you sportsmanship level, and the first time you play you brag that you only just recently started and laughed at someone calling beating him a \"kill\".  Yeah a lot of people wouldn't take that well.  \n\nThe photo just sent everything over the edge.  He snapped because he thought you were in general being rude.  Should he have snapped?  No.  Should you have made the comments you did?

OP wanted to know whether the game was actually over or if his boss could\u2019ve played on despite feeling stuck.\n\nIt may be more helpful in general to analyze the whole game, but it makes sense in this case that OP was particularly interested in the final position and didn\u2019t want to forget it.", "Having all the pieces in place, can't you just recreate it from the one picture, and just by knowing whose turn it was (and she does) she could see if there was a way out. It didn't seem like there was a check mate, just in a bind.", "This also sounds like a good way to create a better work environment. OP mentioned she has a suspicion that he feels negatively about the two of them being equal in the office hierarchy and if that\u2019s true, her asking to learn about one of his favourite hobbies sounds like a great way for him to see that\u2019s a silly way to live!", "umm by putting all the pieces where they were in the picture? she said she wanted to recreate it to see if she could have gotten out of that bind.", "OP isn't going to recreate the whole game - they're going to start playing from that point in the game in the picture. \n\nOP didn't win by checkmate. The colleague surrendered because he was in a bind. OP wants to see if there is a way to get out from that bind.", "This is still super normal, even for casual chess players. Studying games you've played to see what could have been done better/how your opponent could have potentially beaten you is how you get better at the game.", "She\u2019s not \u201cclaiming that it\u2019s to learn how to play\u201d, she specifically stated how she is going to use the picture to better her game. And she\u2019s clearly learning how to play just fine if she beat someone with much more experience than her. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That\u2019s the Fool\u2019s Mate. Scholar\u2019s Mate is the classic 4-move checkmate.", "love to see a chess snob who can't tell the difference between fools mate and scholars mate", "Yea it's not really the time of it.  It is everything.  Like if I went to my buddies house and he had settlers of catan out, and people wanted to play.  You wouldn't go, oh I have been trying to study this game, and start making notes while the game is going on, people are going to look at you weird.\n\nI grew up in chess club and had some friends that took chess very seriously.  I have never seen someone write down the moves to game that didn't have a clock"]}
