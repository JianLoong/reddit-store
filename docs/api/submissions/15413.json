Why does your coworker's political standpoint matter? How does your assumption that he resents you factor into this game?\n\n\nHonestly? It makes me think you provided those \"facts\" so people would side with you quicker. The whole vide is \"I'm a young woman that got a crushing win over the right wing old man!\"\n\n\nI will also add you taking out your phone and snapping a picture is shitty. AND only because you didn't say anything until after you laughed at his expense. Which seems even worse as he showed you basic respect by shaking your hand.", "NTA, sore looser.

This is ridiculous.", "NTA, but also kind of depends... do you normally take pictures of your games afterwards to go over them again with your bf?\n\nIt also depends on the vibe of the game, but I bet if the situation had been reversed where he took a pic after beating you, people would be reacting differently here.  If I'm competing with someone in some casual game, I'm definitely not documenting it afterwards, that seems pretty tacky unless there's a certain rapport with that person.", "NAH.", "NTA because I assume you would have also taken the picture if you\u2019d lost to do the same thing.", "NTA and \"classless\" is a dogwhistle.

I don't think you actually meant that, but it comes across that way and I could see him thinking that especially since he hadn't played you before.  He had no basis for you sportsmanship level, and the first time you play you brag that you only just recently started and laughed at someone calling beating him a \"kill\".  Yeah a lot of people wouldn't take that well.  \n\nThe photo just sent everything over the edge.  He snapped because he thought you were in general being rude.  Should he have snapped?

Once they got into the workplace, computer knowledge was required at many jobs and often included teaching the older employees how to use computers.  Some Gen Xers aren't as into cell phones, but it's not because phones are oh so difficult.  It's because useful smart phones didn't become a thing until the 2000s so it wasn't an ingrained habit.
