Based on what you are saying; it seems so bizarre?", "NTA  \nif she wasn't being such an asshole and so stupidly manipulative about kids she KNOWS she can't even have, then she wouldn't have gotten such a response back. \n\nyou know you're infertile, you know kids are a low low LOW chance, and still you wanna use that as your way of manipulating someone into acting how you want them to act? that just seesm unintelligible to me and like you're asking for a reality check, which is exactly what OP gave her.   \n\n\nWas OP's comment mean? yeah, but it was also a reality check that DIL needed to hear because of how she was acting. so IMO OP gets a pass because she never would have made that comment if DIL wasn't being such an insufferable, manipulative shrew", "NTA\n\nWhy on earth is your son letting her talk to you like this?", "NTA  . A woman I talk/drink with at the casino bought herself a replacement grandchild . It's one of those \"real babies\" , when her daughter in-law, did the you can't see the kids cause you have a different opinion .  She took it to Disney world and sent back pictures . Christmas time tree presents from Santa . Her son hates it when his friends ask him how his sister is.", "NTA. being infertile doesn't give her the right to be an a**hole without consequences. I would tell them you'll apologize as long as she does too and stops with the stupid threats. \n\nshe was practically asking for a low blow with her nagging comments", "NTA - kids are an off limits topic to most, simply out of respect.\n\nHer constant bringing up the fact is how this topic even got put on the table.\n\nIt\u2019s also fine to not like someone, what is not fine is throwing our arbitrary and meaningless threats covered in cheeky one liners vs setting real boundaries if she felt like you were so awful. \n\n**It is entirely possible to have neutral relationships, where you spend time with your son (and her only on special occasions) where everyone can remain civil. Marrying or birthing someone does not mean you\u2019re love and connect with every single person in their lives.** And that\u2019s perfectly fine!", "NTA\n\n\nShe can\u2019t constantly use non existent grandkids as leverage against you then get upset when it blows up in her face, how obnoxious of her.", "I was completely ready to say Y T A by the title because infertility is horrible and really causes a lot of pain.  After reading all the time your DIL is saying stupid things like you better change or can't see the grandkids, NTA, she can't continue to threaten over and over something that she doesn't have.  What the hell is wrong with her?  She says this over staying up late, snacks, and the way you want to vote?!???", "NTA\n\nAnd wow she sounds annoying. Threatening to hold her kids hostage in a way because you two see things differently. I don't even know her and I'm annoyed.", "NTA - If you want to keep the peace, you can apologize for snapping at her (not for what you said, but how you said it). Tell your son (again)  that you and his wife may not get along all that well, but there's no excuse for her being so antagonistic. She's free to dislike your preferences, but her consistent threats and discourtesy needs to stop. Should he ever have children you are willing to respect their choices and boundaries with regards to the kids - dietary restrictions, no late night eating, school choice, clothing choices and so on. However, her insistence on trying to control your everyday expression of preferences, personal choices that affect no one but yourself, whether or not your vote for one of the Big Two, etc.  by threatening access to future grandchildren is not only inappropriate, but has become wearisome.  She needs to eliminate that phrase from her vocabulary - her insistence on unneccesary provocation is concerning - if she cannot say something polite, then she shouldn't say anything at all.", "NTA.\n\nShe should not be holding grandkids as a bargaining chip just because she does not agree with you. Your son has to put a stop to this because if and when you do have grandkids, this relationship is not healthy. She is going through a lot and should speak with a therapist about her feelings instead of lashing out towards you. \n\nI do think you should apologize as it is a sensitive topic for her, but she is the asshole here.", "Granted this is narrated from your perspective, but as written NTA.  She shouldn't be trying to control you.  Grandkids are not a bargaining chip.  And it was really stupid to bring them up if she is sensitive about not having any.  Oh, and taking a piss at someone who is hosting you is super rude as well!", "NTA, don't start none, won't be none. She makes constant digs at you and holds non existing kids from you as a threat. If she's infertile, does that mean she's planning to adopt or get a surrogate THEN withhold thoes kids from you for some perceived slight in her eyes? And where is your sin in all this? Why isn't he shutting her down when she gets all nasty like that?\n\nEdit: Never mind,  I didn't see the end about surrogates and adoptions and their opinions on them. So where in the blue hell would a grandkid come from?? I'm confused!", "NTA because for every disagreement she has about you or something you do, she constantly uses her future child(ren) as a weapon to make snarky remarks or to try and force you to her way of thinking or doing things. It wasn't a good thing to say, but ffs, one can only take it for so long before they snap.", "Info: can they afford IVF or adoption? Them preferring the \u201cnatural\u201d way might be a cover for that. \n\nEither way, she was using future grandkids as a threat or power trip to fuck with you.", "NTA. Your dil is being unnecessarily cruel and rude. She needs to be told that your decisions and choices are not up for discussion as they have no impact on her.  If she balks and has a fit that's on your son to handle.", "I mean, I'd take the opportunity now to go very low contact with them since she seems to believe that making you 'get in line' is through blackmail and insults.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nShe tried to weaponise hypothetical grandchildren, you called her on it. She just found out that it\u2019s a double edged sword. \n\nPerhaps taking a break from your son and DiL will benefit everyone.

She hasn\u2019t even had kids yet and she\u2019s already using them to try and control you. Infertility sucks, it\u2019s hard and heartbreaking, but it doesn\u2019t give her the right to be a shitty, controlling person.", "NTA - she was just asking for that comment! Wow.", "NTA.\n\nShe is weaponizing hypothetical kids as a means to control how you vote, how you eat, how you spend your money... That in itself is disgusting. Meanwhile, she can't even have kids.\n\nYou tried talking to your son about it, and she kept at it. Frankly, I would've said the same thing.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds exhausting. The fact that she feels it\u2019s ok to speak to you this way, and your son isn\u2019t doing anything about it it not a good sign. \n\nThreatening to withhold non-existent grandkids because you left a 15% tip vs a 20% tip on a meal you treated them to shows she\u2019s\u2026well she\u2019s entitled at the least and a bit of an idiot with no manners at the worst. \n\nIf someone\u2019s paying for my meal, I just say thank you.", "NTA, she vollied the topic into the conversation. You only spiked it.", "Well.... I mean, your response was indeed a low blow... but using hypothetical children as a means of trying to control someone you don't agree with is just as ridiculous.  It wasn't right, but I definitely understand. With that being said, ESH. It's also out of pocket on her behalf to behave so immaturely when you're paying for her dinner. Your son should've told her a while ago to stop saying that about the hypothetical children. I would imagine that is a touchy subject for the both of them, so they should utilize a bit more common sense around the subject.", "Nta, she is really hanging that non existant fruit over your head, she must be really insecure about it at this point. Children (hypothetical or not) shouldnt be used as manipulation tactics.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps, being out of control of her own fertility and unwilling to do anything about it such as IVF or adoption, she is trying to establish control by dictating your life and choices.\n\nHer comments are all about controlling your actions, while using these hypothetical children as the key reason.\n\nWhat else would she use to try and control you over time?", "So, she can't have kids naturally and they are against IVF or adoption. What are they think is going to happen? The stork will land on their lawn one day and just magically hand them a baby?   \n\n\nAlso, who the .... has that as a resort-to comment? Do this/don't do that, or you won't see your grandkids.   \nMaybe I'm an asshole as well then, because when my cup was full I probably would have responded the same way.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. She is completely rude person with main character syndrome.", "NTA, she threw the first punch and the 2nd, 3rd, 4th.......you eventually hit her back", "NTA. She is cruel and manipulative.

Your son needs to wake-up and take action.", "NTA\n\nOpen and shut case of FAFO", "NTA. DIL was being rude and manipulative.\n\nAlso, with their opinions about IVF and adoption, I am glad they can't have children.", "NTA. She sounds condescending. If she thought the servers should have been given a better tip she could have paid for it herself.", "NTA. She dished it out. You fought back.", "i mean she sounds exhausting ngl. judging from what i can see, the nuclear option was probably called for. but it was really harsh\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Nta the fact she keeping using her invisible not going to happen kids as a stick to beat you with and then is all Shocked pikachu when you use the same invisible kids back at her is pretty hilarious tbh.", "ESH\n\nI think you and your dil are just having a relationship thats toxic from both sides", "Nta", "NTA \n\nHowever you need to put your foot down about her lack of respect for you in your home or when you are hosting her outside of it.

Why would she randomly say that to you over such minor things?", "Ouch, as an adoptee I guess I\u2019m glad no other adoptee will be subjected to her level of crazy.

You **acted like** an AH that one time; she **is** **being** the AH on a regular basis.", "ESH\n\nDIL sounds incredibly annoying!

You should say that every time she makes her threat.", "NTA. You can only take so much bullying and that's what she was doing. Next time try \"Y;now, I was thinking of having another kid. I checked with my doctor and he said it shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA. Your DIL sounds like a bit of an extremist, but threatening to withhold visitation of a real child for petty reasons is abusive, and threatening the same for a non-existant child is weird af.

I've literally had people claim \"well I'm probably autistic is why\", but never diagnosed. And it's been my experience that mhmr doesn't preclude you from being an asshole that has nothing to do with your diagnosis.
