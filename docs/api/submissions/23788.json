There are large multi-user facilities with no locks on the door, and single-user facilities with locks. Sometimes, you get a parent and child single-family facility with a lock on the door, and more than one toilet inside.

I don\u2019t really know why you asked honestly a lot of changing stations only have one so it\u2019s normal to wait till it\u2019s free. I would also likely lock the door. No one likes waiting, but it\u2019s weird to confront someone about locking a door to a bathroom.

You could have apologized for making them upset and that it wasn\u2019t your intention. \n\nThey have a newborn, it\u2019s a changing room (not a regular public bathroom but a single room) probably similar to a family bathroom. They probably wanted privacy and to feel safe and comfortable while changing the baby. They\u2019re also kind of in the wrong for coming back to berate you for it.", "Privacy is allowed. Not only just for that reason also because there is a lock so people are allowed to use it and there are reasons why privacy can be even more important to some.

Sometimes when you start a confrontation you get push back, and you have to deal with that. \n\nThat being said it\u2019s understandable that you were annoyed. When your kid has an accident it\u2019s really hard to be patient when waiting for a restroom to be open. But I\u2019m sure you remember when your child was a newborn.

I would also give privacy to someone else using it.\n\nBut we also have \u2018parents rooms\u2019 which are a shared space.

There\u2019s also usually a toilet that is large enough to fit a trolley or pram & has an adult toilet next to a toddler toilet. Some even have a little play area to occupy older kids whilst changing or feeding.

Surely most families with 2 littlies small enough to both need changing would be happy enough to do 1 at a time, especially given most places only have 1 spot.

It\u2019s probably designed that way for families with twins or two young children so two parents/adults can change two kids at the same time and be a little quicker, rather than two complete strangers changing their kids in there together.

I too would lock the door because it\u2019s a private situation.", "Honestly it's just a weird set up. You're not supposed to leave a kid unattended, so I can't imagine how you are meant to change two children at the same time. So single family use with multiple children doesn't really make sense to me (I'm aware that you can have two parents but most things are not designed with that in mind). But also, sharing the room with some random person also doesn't make sense to me, with no partition. It's just a bizarre setup either way.", "Most change tables aren\u2019t in a stall at all, instead they are in the open in view of the entire bathroom.
