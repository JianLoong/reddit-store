I went to the nearest changing room and it was locked. I knew there were two changing stations in there, but when the door opened a few minutes later two women came out with a small baby.\n\nI politely asked them why they locked the door and explained there were multiple changing stations in there. The first woman apologised and said she was, \u201cnew to this whole mummy thing\u201d and doesn\u2019t know how everything works yet.\n\nThe second woman started arguing, asking why there would be a lock on the door if it\u2019s not meant to be used.\n\nThey walked away and I started to change my daughter. A few minutes later, the second woman came back very angry (while she was also breastfeeding the baby), saying that I had made her wife cry and that she had postnatal anxiety and it was one of their first days out and I needed to consider the impact of what I said to new mums.\n\nI explained I wasn\u2019t responsible for her reaction and continued changing my daughter. The woman kept arguing, saying that they could\nlock the door if they wanted to and that they wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing the space. She said she hoped I felt guilty. I said I didn\u2019t and told her I was surprised by how bothered she seemed to be and that I was changing my daughter.\n\nShe was very angry and left after about five minutes of having a go at me.", "created_utc": 1691068808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h435r/aita_for_asking_why_you_would_lock_the_door_to/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That feels to me like something that should be private.", "Info: I'm assuming the changing station was in a restroom.  Was the restroom single-occupancy?", "YTA\n\nA room with changing stations and a lock on the door is clearly designed for a single family to use at a time.\n\nEveryone is familiar with public bathrooms. There are large multi-user facilities with no locks on the door, and single-user facilities with locks. Sometimes, you get a parent and child single-family facility with a lock on the door, and more than one toilet inside. Just because there are multiple toilets in one family cubicle doesn't mean that there's an expectation that you leave the door open to allow some stranger to use the other toilet.", "NTA public bathrooms with multiple stalls sometimes have locks on their doors but that doesn't mean that one person gets to lock the door and use 5 different stalls and sinks at the same time. She was just overcompensating because she doesn't want to admit that their behavior was rude.", "I can\u2019t lie I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable changing my kid next to someone also changing their kid. It sounds like it\u2019s not private and it\u2019s just a room with two changing stations. I don\u2019t really know why you asked honestly a lot of changing stations only have one so it\u2019s normal to wait till it\u2019s free. I would also likely lock the door. No one likes waiting, but it\u2019s weird to confront someone about locking a door to a bathroom. I think YTA for your reaction to upsetting her it\u2019s not hard to say you\u2019re sorry you didn\u2019t mean to upset her", "YTA. There is a lock on the door, so they are entitled to lock it and change their child in private, and you can wait your turn. You were being rude and entitled.", "YTA\u2014 why stop people essentially coming out of the public bathroom? Maybe one of the women needed to change her clothes too. Or even if they were having sex or having a party in there\u2014 they were leaving and you\u2019ll never see them again, so why bother interacting at all?", "YTA\n\n\nIt was a single room - just because it has two changing stations doesn't stop the right to privacy!", "Ehh\u2026 I\u2019m going with ESH. Not for asking, but for arguing about it and saying \u201cyour response isn\u2019t my responsibility.\u201d That might be harshly true, but being a mom, you could have been a bit more empathetic. She\u2019s not wrong in saying you could have considered how your words could come across. You could have apologized for making them upset and that it wasn\u2019t your intention. \n\nThey have a newborn, it\u2019s a changing room (not a regular public bathroom but a single room) probably similar to a family bathroom. They probably wanted privacy and to feel safe and comfortable while changing the baby. They\u2019re also kind of in the wrong for coming back to berate you for it.", "Privacy is allowed. Not only just for that reason also because there is a lock so people are allowed to use it and there are reasons why privacy can be even more important to some. As an example, what if the kid had a disability and there are more things that have to be done than changing a diaper. So many scenarios that are a legit reason to lock the door.\n\nIt didn't took long. YTA", "YTA", "You started the confrontation\u2026did you assume they would just cower to you and your needs, apologize, and you could walk away feeling vindicated? Sometimes when you start a confrontation you get push back, and you have to deal with that. \n\nThat being said it\u2019s understandable that you were annoyed. When your kid has an accident it\u2019s really hard to be patient when waiting for a restroom to be open. But I\u2019m sure you remember when your child was a newborn. Your overtired, over stimulated, hormones out of whack, you have no idea what you\u2019re doing, leaving the house is nerve wracking etc. \n\n\u2026I think a little compassion could have gone along way here. \nYTA", "NTA, my mom was like This with me as a kid she locked the stall door and change my younger sibling with me and my older sister guarding the door so no other women force it open, I understand privacy so NTA-", "YTA there is a lock on the door so it\u2019s meant to be locked if needed. I\u2019d want privacy as well, just wait your turn.", "Yta, you mentioned it has two stations. The purpose was probably for families that needed to change two kids and two adults were able to change them at the same time. \n\nPersonal I prefer the stations in the stall so i am locked inside. I feel more safe that way. I don\u2019t  need to be constantly checking around me to see who coming near. I would have locked it myself. Especially since i have two kids. Less stress to be able to make sure my toddler not trying to be that kid who crawls under a stall", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then I don't really know about how I'd view it.

How do you know that Mum didn't need to change her top as well?\n\nYTA", "You are in the bathroom, no need to lock the door imo. They were obviously new parents so that maybe gets a pass, but it quickly gets to the point of changing wherever you can.", "That\u2019s a really good point", "As OP said, this wasn't a bathroom.  It was a room with two changing tables and a lock on the door.  The individual changing tables were not separated into cubicles, which would suggest that it's a space intended for a single family with multiple children, rather than multiple families to use at once.  I wouldn't be comfortable to change my child with someone else changing their child next to me, with no divider in between.  Confronted with this situation, I'd lock the door and change my child quickly.  If anyone called me out on it, I'd just say \"sorry, I'm not comfortable sharing the space  for something that feels so private. You can use it now\" and leave."]}
