Different people might be ok with it, if they are used to that.  I am used to it being private, so if I had the option to give myself the privacy I am used to, I would do that.  If it's an enourmous communal space equivalent to a public bathroom FULL of multiple tables, I wouldn't lock that, because that's actually a major inconvenience.  If it's this exact scenario, where there is one other table and max one person will have to wait 2 mins, I don't think that is enough of a big deal to warrant the aggression I'm seeing.  I would be prepared to wait that long for someone else, so I don't think it's too entitled.  Many thanks!", "This room is like a public bathroom that has multiple stalls.

They give you side-eye if your kid laughs to loud in a restaurant, or if they\u2019re crying, even if you\u2019re rushing to remove them from the situation and take them outside.\n\nNot everyone is like that, but people are jerks, you learn for the most part to ignore it because it\u2019s the only way to survive.

Waiting a couple of minutes for a changing table isn't much different from waiting for a bathroom stall, and I can't blame people for wanting privacy assuming they aren't hogging the changing tables, which it doesn't sound like they were", "Sorry for not expressing myself properly - I meant in this specific case, I'll use the lock if there is one, that's all", "What do you think I might be doing?", "That's unkind.  Why do you feel this way?", "Thanks you, I know you're right.  I am prepared for it, I just think there are lots of ways I can try to minimize it and this specifically would make me more comfortable.

I think it would be more fair to compare it to two toilets, side by side with no partition.\n\nI don't think you're arguing in good faith, even if you mean well.  I think it would be best for both of us if you take a break to figure out what this is actually bringing up for you, because I can understand you feel differently about this than I do but I don't think I'd be causing anyone enough trouble to warrant this level of annoyance.", "Fair - I personally think the asking the question was fine (though that all depends on how she asked and how she responded which we don\u2019t know) sucks it upset someone else but honestly she was also probably emotionally wrung out from wrangling a small child covered in urine or poop. Not all of us make our best decision in the moment. \n\nI find the fact that the other women who got upset with her about asking the question and wanting the door locked to change her child in private (a fair personal decision) - then decided to barge in on OP changing her child and yell at her while her child was exposed.

So what about changing a child makes you feel you specifically need privacy?", "It is unkind. But most baby changing stations are private. These were obviously intended for two and they decided to make a poor kid stew in their own excrement because they wanted more comfort than is normally afforded in this context.", "Because you're selfish and portray it as \"boundaries\"", "I don\u2019t think it makes you creepy. I think it might make life hard but you do what you need to do what you think is best for your kid. It might change with time, it might not.

The longer the kid is in said diaper the worst. \n\nAnd if people can see your baby while you are changing them you are doing it wrong. The adult's body covers most of the baby, to be honest.", "Lmfao.  Your argument is shit.  Stop with the long winded responses.  It\u2019s inconsiderate af to lock the damn door if the space is meant to change multiple babies.   Period."]}
