We have 4 lunch periods and my class has 3rd lunch. My phone had died so I decided I was gonna use my chromebook at lunch to pass the time. \n\nYou can see where this is going right? \n\nAnyways, at lunch, mindlessly scrolling through buzz feed, when suddenly, the tab closes. I thought maybe I had accidentally misclicked. I reopened the tap but it closes again. I was confused, so I tried opening other tabs to see if it was just that website, but nope. They all closed. After about 1 minute of confusion, I finally realized what was going on. \n\nI was furious. I closed my chromebook and finished lunch. When I went back to class I asked my teacher about it, he said that the chromebook was only to be used for school purposes. I told him that that wasn\u2019t fair because this was my leisure time and he should not be watching my chromebook in my personal time. He kept telling me the same things over and over so I just stayed quiet.\n\nI was still mad though, so during passing period. I took a trip to the principals office and reported him.  The principal said she would look into it.\n\nWhen I get home and told my mom about the situation, she said I overreacted. She said that the computer was only for school use and I should not be using it for anything else. \n\nNow im worried. Im wondering if I did overreact?

Our principal is very fair and considers school policy and also fair treatment of students.\n\nAlso, as might not surprise you, we're very familiar with all of the bullshit that high school students pull.\n\nSo basically, if you're right, your principal will talk to your teacher and tell him what he is supposed to do.

Teacher here, he\u2019s definitely not the AH for closing your tabs during class. It\u2019s extremely frustrating when students are constantly on the wrong page.

Like is this a known policy school-wide?", "INFO: please provide clarification on your schools tech use policies. \n\nWithout knowing your schools rules for tech usage it\u2019s hard to give a proper judgement. Seems like a pretty petty thing to report a teacher for but if you\u2019re allowed to do whatever on the device outside of class then it\u2019s justified. If the rules say that they\u2019re only to be used for school then yeah y t a. \n\nEither way count yourself lucky that you even have Chromebook\u2019s or can use your phones during school.", "INFO: does the Chromebook belong to the school? Are there policies you agreed to before being able to use the Chromebook? Did you violate those policies?", "NTA - You\u2019re 15. Good move discussing with the principal and your mom. \n\nHowever, if the school owns the device then they can/will impose restrictions on how it can be used. Same as if you had a laptop provided by a future employer.\n\nIt\u2019s a life lesson.

Every \"hack\" we found eventually got banned by the school IP. We didn't complain to the principal that we couldn't get on MySpace, we just kept getting more creative. Looks like the schools got more creative in return. It is what it is.", "I do think it's odd and possibly creepy that he's watching what you (and most likely everyone else) are doing, but there is probably a disclaimer somewhere that states you have no expectation of privacy on the school's equipment. This is true for most corporate and government devices as well, but the watchdogs aren't nearly this vigilant. Your best bet is to find a good book to hang out with during your downtime at school. I'm sorry for you, though. I wouldn't be 15 again for all the money in the country.", "NTA. \n\nAs a parent of kid in 6th grade with a school-issued chromebook, I think this is way out of bounds. \n\nThe school will have blocks on any non-approved websites. (Ours can't get into Pokemon for example, because it's highly distracting.)  The kids are allowed to access approved websites on their own time. They also take their chromebooks home and use them for non-school activities. \n\nIt sounds like not only is the teacher overstepping his bounds on how kids use the chromeboook, but that he also had remote access to OP's chromebook, and was monitoring her usage during her free time. That is creepy, and completely unacceptable. How did he get this access? Is he also part of the IT staff? He is abusing his position as a teacher and his access to the school network. \n\nUnless this school has a very strict policy on chromebook usage during free time, and unless this teacher has explicit rights to monitor and access students' laptops, he is way out of bounds.", "Dude was watching his students while on lunch.", "NTA.\n\nYou will never be the asshole for reporting something to authority figures. If they did something wrong, they will get reprimanded. If they did nothing wrong, nothing will happen to them. Either way you're in the clear.", "I'm not going to call you an ahole for this, but you and your parents likely agreed that it would be used only for school purposes, which buzzfeed is not.  You're not going to get the teacher in trouble for this.   Id bet money that the principal probably won't even bring it up to the teacher.   \n\nIt's a lesson you'll need to learn.   Using a school or work computer will almost assuredly be monitored on some level.   Use your phone for your leisure browsing.", "maybe next time use your chromebook to charge your phone", "NTA.\n\nIf the principal said \"I'll look into it\" instead of \"that's not what the chromebooks are for\", than I assume that means browsing the internet during your free period is allowed.\n\nEven if the teacher is technically correct, a good principal will want to know if he's being a wierd jerk about it, because that can be indicative of other issues", "Info: Does the school have a rule about using it for personal use? If they do and it's not allowed  YTA. We had strict guidelines for using our laptops at school, and same with our work ones.", "Was there any type of use agreement for the equipment?", "NTA. You reporting it is fine. The principal can decide whether it was according to the rules or not.", "INFO: Who bought the chromebook?", "NTA\n\nI was issued an iPad at 14 by my hs. They understood that we were kids and told us that they knew we\u2019re gonna mess around on them. Of course some kids tried porn sites but oop they were blocked. If your school thought it was THAT serious they would\u2019ve previously blocked sites they didn\u2019t want you on. some people forget that we\u2019re human and there\u2019s no way to ONLY focus on school for 8hrs or work for that long. was defs creepy of him to be actively monitoring your activity while not in his class.", "INFO: does your teacher keep such a watchful eye on all of his other pupils? Have you been in trouble before for using the laptop to look up anything concerning/inappropriate that would cause a teacher to monitor your usage closely?", "NAH. Everyone will get clarification soon enough what school policies are if they were not clear.", "NTA. From the sounds of it, you didn't talk back to the teacher nor explode on the principal by calling the teacher names. The principal said they'd look into it, and hopefully this results in a school wide policy regarding chromebook use. However I have a feeling that the result will be that school property only be used for school work, thus you won't get to use them leisurely.", "I remember when I was in high school and had a school issued laptop, the rule was as long nothing illegal was being done on the computer than there is no real issue, sometimes research for different projects can look like \u201cpersonal time\u201d so we were given leeway. Most websites that we aren\u2019t allowed to visit were blocked anyways, like Facebook and others so if this school really wanted to prevent students from using the Chromebook\u2019s for personal time they would\u2019ve had blocked sites. NTA.", "So as a former teacher I can say in my experience, as long as you weren't on an inappropriate site - dating, porn, hate, etc. and weren't trying to download things no one really cared. Pretty sad he had nothing better to do during lunch. I was strict but not a dick like that.\n\nIs there a school policy, if so you may have over reacted but still, NTA. Even without a policy it's not like the principle is going to do any formal disciplining.", "NTA, wtf?", "INFO: who bought the Chromebook, the school or you (your family, I mean)? Also, do you bring this Chromebook home with you (regardless of who bought it)?", "Your Mom is right, you can't complain when you used it for reasons other than what it is assigned for. The school has every right to monitor what students do on school Chromebooks. Just like an employer has the right to monitor work computers and emails. See it as a life lesson and move on. Soft YTA.", "NTA. I think it's a good thing the principal knows about this. There need to be clear rules about this. You should also know when you can be monitored. This needs more discussion and regulation.", "NTA\n\nThe teacher has the power to monitor and affect the computers so that he can make sure they are used appropriately during class. It seems that he has gone on a power trip, however, and taken it upon himself to govern their usage at all times.\n\nThat is not his job, and it was not why he was given monitoring authority.\n\nNote:\n\n>If we finish with our work and try and do other homework, he closes out those tabs and tells us to just close our chromebooks.\n\nHe is actually preventing students from using the chromebook for school work because it offends his sense of propriety. He is TA for this reason.\n\n>She said that the computer was only for school use and I should not be using it for anything else.\n\nThe terms for use should be spelled out in the user agreement.\n\nIt is not at all unusual for schools to allow laptops to be used for personal reasons, so long as they don't interfere with school work. So don't visit suspicious websites, and don't goof off during class and you are fine.\n\nIf your school has a different, stricter policy then you are obliged to some degree to follow it. I will say, however, that I think a stricter policy would be stupid and controlling, unless it is a response to a specific problem.", "NTA \n\nWhen I was in 8th grade I entered a program called \u201cblended learning\u201d where I was given my own MacBook. I was allowed to use it for leisure (especially when I was home) but the teachers had a right to check what we were doing during THEIR CLASS TIME and close our tabs that were deemed distracting. \n\nYour teacher is doing a power move. While it is a school computer, it\u2019s your leisure time. Plus, it\u2019s creepy that he\u2019s monitoring you like that. Don\u2019t listen to all the other commenters trying to make you feel bad.", "Yikes. Some of these takes are nearly as creepy as the teacher. \n\nWhy is he so hyper focused on this student. That he is watching/stalking her even when she is at lunch? \n\nLots of people keep saying she should only use it for school work but I guess you missed the part where he closes those windows out if she finishes his work. \n\nAlso, I am certain the school has filters on the computer to clock websites they deem inappropriate. So if the computer allows her to go to buzz feed on her free time, then it\u2019s none of his business. \n\nLastly, he has no clue whether she is researching something for a class and needs to visit non educational websites. \n\nHe is massively overstepping boundaries and is more than a bit of a creep.", "NTA: While you may be wrong for using the computer for non-school use in your leisure time, that is entirely up to your school and parents to decide. What you are absolutely not an AH for is bringing a potential over-reach of a teachers authority to their supervisors attention. It is their job to ensure that all school employees are following the school policies properly. If the teacher did not overstep their authority, then nothing adverse will happen to them for your action. I would suggest that you look into your schools policies and verifying what you are, and are not allowed to do with the computer, and when before using it outside of instruction again. The best rebuke against over-reach of petty authority is being able to quote and source the relevant rules.", "Need more info about this. Is there a general school rule that says you cant use it for personal stuff? If yes, YTA and you need to respect the school rules and his authority.

If not and he chooses to be strict, then sucks for you guys.", "[deleted]", "Your lunch is your time but that Chromebook doesn't belong to you so", "The only way to determine if you're the AH is what the principal does about it. If they side with you, that means the teacher was being too strict. If they don't, that means the teacher was in their rights.", "NTA. If you had truly overreacted, the principal would have told you that school policy supports the teacher. There's really no reason for that teacher to be closing out tabs on your computer, even a school one, outside of his scheduled class time with you.\n\nThat being said, any computer provided by the school will be monitored, and most schools do have policies about what you can and can't do on it. So, for your benefit, I would make sure you familiarize yourself with those standards and stick to them. Your school could take your issued computer back if they felt you weren't treating it as a tool, although it's a pretty extreme measure that isn't likely to happen over something like browsing at lunch. If your teacher gets in trouble, he may be keeping a closer eye on you, though, so you should be aware.", "NTA. Very appropriate to report to the principal. Seems both the students and teachers need guidance of what is an acceptable and not acceptable use for the laptops at different times of day. Buzzfeed is not blocked and you are not in class, so I personally think browsing the internet outside of class is acceptable. Also think your teacher monitoring your browsing outside of class is overreach.", "NTA.\n\nIt's normal for schools to monitor internet use on school-issued laptops, but that's monitoring in the same way that parental control apps monitor. It's not normal for one particular teacher to randomly decide to go see what one student is doing in her lunch time. At worst it's creepy, at best it's needlessly intrusive.", "NTA. My kid (14F) has a Chromebook for school from the school and no one polices what they do on it outside of class short of standard child protections (no porn, no violent stuff, etc.). For many students, the school-issued Chromebook is their only computer. It would like be unrealistic and silly to expect them to NEVER use it for non-school things, especially when not on school time.", "NTA, lots of people claiming YTA but this teacher doesn\u2019t even allow you to work on other assignments when you\u2019re done with his. I do think it\u2019s weird this teacher spends his time monitoring your computer and telling your principal isn\u2019t overkill.

You\u2019re literally in the middle of lunch, I\u2019m honestly laughing at how unrealistic everyone else is being about this.

I think you overreacted and what you did was pointless. Its school equipment, monitoring you is normal, unfortunately.\n\nThe teacher is probably an asshole.

If the teacher is not acting within their scope, then it's even better to bring this to the administration's attention. Possible outcomes should be corrective action against the teacher if warranted or educating the student on the policies. There should not be any negative consequences for the student for reporting events.\n\nPersonally, I think real time monitoring of school issued devices without reasonable cause for concern is creepy at best. It's one thing to run reports on the sites students are visiting to ensure they are not engaging in dangerous behavior. It's another to watch students as they browse and access things like personal email or chat programs where sensitive info may be revealed. And either way, the policy on monitoring devices should be clear and readily accessible (not just a form signed once at the beginning of the year).

I'm not sure what I would do or recommend my kids do, but informing the principal that a teacher is monitoring computer use while not in class seems reasonable.", "At my school we all got iPads from middle school to hs graduation and we were allowed to go on Facebook or even have apps on them and allowed to use them during school times.

I'm gonna just drop this in there [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/more-than-1-000-schools-found-to-be-spying-on-children-s-internet-use-a7404391.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/more-than-1-000-schools-found-to-be-spying-on-children-s-internet-use-a7404391.html)  \n\n\nI imagine if it took me 15 seconds to google educational privacy in the UK, It wouldn't take me much longer to find similiar things across the EU as well", "Speaking from personal experience They would most likely still be able to monitor even at home depending on the school's service.", "It's still gross and condescending lol.", "I remember back using proxy servers to access MySpace,  as the website was blocked by the school \ud83e\udd23.  Yep, I'm aging.", "I don't think teacher is spying. \n\nAt my school there is a notice that all activity on rental equipment can be monitored at all times. So it's like a blanket you agreed to your activity to be monitored when you take the equipment out. \n\nAnother comment also mentioned that some places, there's an app that notifies the teacher when school computers are being used so it might just be that the teacher got a notice that the chrome book is in use when it's not class time so he went to take a look whats going on.", "Ours actually allowed teachers to monitor us when in a certain range and even lock a screen with a pre-determined image. My teacher scared the crap out of me using this because I'm watching adventure time then all of a sudden a picture of Pennywise pops up", "I think it depends.  Teacher might just be getting an alert of some kind when the device is in use to monitor it.  I wouldn't say that is creepy per-se (it's school equipment, it's understandable they might want to keep an eye on how it's being used).  If he's looking at them all the time it is kinda weird though.  \n\nBut without knowing school policy I dunno what the rules even are here.", "You do know that IT always sees what someone is doing on the computer?", "A lot of schools use a program that allows the teacher to see all of the screens for their class during the allotted time (which would run through their lunch break). It\u2019s not \u201cremote spying\u201d - it\u2019s making sure the kids aren\u2019t just getting on youtube or prodigy when they\u2019re still learning how to finish tasks responsibly and on time. OP is just mad she can\u2019t dick around on a screen. She could\u2019ve just chatted with friends during lunch instead of bringing a whole ass chromebook.    \nBut additionally, the teacher was probably eating lunch. I\u2019d sooner bet buzzfeed was just blocked on the school\u2019s wifi, and OP blamed her teacher because she doesn\u2019t like that he\u2019s strict. Honestly, in a school large enough to have 4 lunch blocks, that level of strictness is not surprising. It\u2019s a good way to not let the kids take advantage of you or let the classroom get out of control.", "Yeah, even if OP was breaking the rules, random monitoring (by  a teacher, at that, not a designated IT staff member) outside of class hours still seems like a violation. I assume remote monitoring let's you see everything they're doing, not just programs/tabs open... maybe it's just me, but if the kid was writing an essay I would also take issue with a teacher checking in and seeing a working a draft during lunch when it's not in a place to get turned in. Lots of times kids put lines in essays like \"this essay is stupid\" that I think they deserve to not have their teacher see if they take it out by the time they turn it in. \n\nThat said, when I was in school, the school only provided computer labs with desktops in limited numbers.", "If the school owns the Chromebooks (and presumably the network they are on) the school has every right to the device. Its called an acceptable use policy", "I don't disagree, but I could see why a school would also strictly adhere to a policy given the problems social media causes schools.", "She said that her teacher said differently. Policy in one classroom doesn't mean it's an across the board rule.", "Not to mention it may NOT be their property. She may be allowed to keep the chromebook when she graduates. You literally are assuming so much shit.", "You know the rules of one school, if that.\n\nYour obsession with thinking your assumption is fact is kind of weird.", "Rightttttt", "Yeah, it could get really tricky for some people. They only started the search history thing when I was a senior. By then my parents trusted me enough and didn't care to snoop through my search history when the school emailed it to them. One extremely funny thing I remember happening was when a group of kids were doing a research project on whatever animal they wanted, and the group chose naked mole rats. All their computers got flagged because the search history included the word \"naked\" and the group was sent to the office.", "Incorrect. I work for a multinational company.

My company monitors every keystroke on the company computer.", "This just isn\u2019t true. Weird thing to troll about, but employers absolutely can and do monitor keystrokes if they want. And a lot of them want.", "What kind of sense does that make?

Related. Assignments. On. School. Property.", "She wasn't \"clearly not allowed\". Her one teacher has a policy that he's enforcing across the board. If OP truly violated a policy, the principal wouldn't have even entertained the complaint.", "An IT person and a bot knowing what you're doing with a device is different than a teacher for one particular class monitoring it outside of class hours and closing tabs they judge as not classwork (nevermind they may not know what exact work you've got in other classes).", "I realize that, but most teachers aren\u2019t anal about their students tabs like what OP\u2019s teacher is. I mean, can\u2019t even do other homework without getting it closed? Come on now, that\u2019s just controlling.", "Well not really clearly.\n\n Nobody would expect the teacher to be looking in on your laptop in real-time during your lunch break. \n\nThat's really weird.", "As if Lmao bet you don\u2019t ever take a little extra time on your break or use your phone while on the clock like every other normal person", "Lmao good response.", "I\u2019m not assuming, I\u2019m using the information she gave in the post.

They\u2019re not getting constant notifications every time a student goes to buzzfeed or pinterest or every teacher on the planet would have quit instead of just the half that are quitting already.", "I bet you're fun at parties.", "I think there\u2019s a line between monitoring that the kids are not doing something nefarious and checking and closing tabs when a student is having lunch and browsing buzzfeed to decompress. Again, I think this teacher went too far.", "Thank you!  My thoughts exactly, if the op wanted downtime then they should've charged their phone.", "i have a school chromebook and no rules like this were included when we were given them, you sound like youre the teacher", "she was on school grounds, during school time using a school owned device and was aon a website that wasnt for school work/activities..pretty clear she is in the wrong", "If you have ever used a work computer, you've used a computer that is being monitored.", "Coming in hot there bud. I work in banking. I'm not necessarily saying there is one guy assigned to watch my every move I'm stating that monitoring the pc is happening from the time the computer loads to the second it powers down and that's how it works for many companies. Yes, if they wanted to they could remote access my computer. The point being when you are using company, or in this case school, property you accept the limitations that come with it. If the school/teacher is saying that the computer is only to be used for school work then unfortunately and no matter how ridiculous that seems to us, those are the rules.", "Cry about it?", "I mean it seems like there\u2019s no ban on them using their phones at lunch, which if they were concerned about social media seems like it would be the much bigger issue.

Social media can be devastating to young people.", "For me the weird part is that teacher was looking at the laptop outside of classtime. Was he targeting HER specifically? Does he get a notification every time one of his students is using their chromebook? Or is he just hanging out waiting for a student to \"misbehave?\" Surely he has better things to do than stalk a 15 year old girl.", "Even if they decide to do that, it\u2019s still school property until the time that the student graduates. Then the school IT will remove the district settings at that time, THEN it becomes personal property.", "[deleted]", "she wasnt doing homework..she was playing on her chromebook to pass the time", "I honestly can only speak for the systems that I have personally seen and used. I have to choose to sign into a specific class. I don't look at what my 5th period students are doing when they aren't in my class, it isn't my place to. I could sign in and see what they are doing on a weekend if I wanted to, but I never would because it is inappropriate. \n\nThe question is why was he logged on to look at her specific class when that class wasn't in the room? \n\nHonestly without knowing what kind of system is being used it's hard to give any kind of assessment.", "does it matter?  they are all school employees", "ok cool story", "Sigh.", "what part of not allowed to look at anything other then school related is hard for so many of you to understand?", "it's still pretty creepy that this guy was monitoring this specific kid's internet use and actively watching them browse websites.", "Dude omg lol.

The school is just covering their ass in case something happens that opens them up to a lawsuit.", "If it\u2019s GoGuardian, he likely had the whole class open since that is the default. Any kid who\u2019s not on a Chromebook would show as inactive on the teacher view and her activity would stick out. Dude\u2019s on a power trip, though.", "Except that the principal wouldn't be dismissing OP's complaint if she just told her that the teacher was right, she would be explaining that there isn't nothing to complain about bc the teacher didn't do nothing wrong, instead it seem like the teacher WAS overstepping if she's gonna look into it", "That's absolutely untrue lmao now you're speaking out of your ass just to try and shame a child for doing something that wasn't bad. Gtfo", "Except that she said even when she's doing homework, he closes it. The guy's a control freak. You finish with your work for his class, you're not allowed to do anything for other classes, you just get to sit there.", "I don\u2019t see the issue with that is though, it\u2019s not like she downloaded any games or was going on illegal sites. Scrolling through buzzfeed during lunch isn\u2019t anything to get worked up about.", "yes but teachers don't typically know the IT policies the same way an IT department would, and allowing teachers that kind of access sounds like a bad time.", "I just read through the online permissions page that we had to sign when our child checked out a school laptop this year. Nowhere does it say that the kids can't browse the internet on it. There is a code of conduct, of course, and it does speak about blocked sites, but it doesn't say kids can't do what OP was doing. \n\nI realize this is purely anecdotal and could be specific to my country and state but it also could be that OP and their parents signed a similar document. \n\nAlso, it's possible that Buzzfeed could be used for research purposes in certain senarios. My kid does congress style debate and the topics they have to research vary wildly and sometimes are pretty out there. The teacher had no way of knowing why OP was on the site they were on and it does seem like the teacher was on a bit of a power trip.", "Would you be okay with your boss telling you you're not allowed to read news while on your lunch break at work?\n\nKids and teens are people too.", "do u know how it works?  they arent monitoring her computer..they get alerts when websites are accessed then they see who accessed it..", "It's not creepy, it's part of the job.

So in essence they do keep us from scrolling through things like Buzzfeed, and we make sure we have charged phones so we can do it from our own devices. How is this different?", "If I was using work equipment and internet access to do so, then yes. It's a pretty standard thing anywhere I have worked that there is an IT policy in place saying that anything you access is monitored, and that the use of conpany equipment for non-work-related activities is prohibited.", "and then they can actively take over the computer, while the student is using it? any teacher in a school has that ability at any time? that's....very big brother", "If that was the case, then every student would be getting called to the office. No one cares if you\u2019re going on buzzed or YouTube or whatever as long as it\u2019s not porn, online shopping, illegal sites, or social media. You\u2019re making this out to be a bigger deal than what it really is.", "wait till you hear how they have cameras on school grounds and watch students., or how they have security keeping an eye on students.  so yes when your using a school issued device they keep an eye on you", "LOL no actually and and the OP are..she knew she wasnt allowed on the site..she did it anyway and it got shut down.  time to learn a lesson..dont use property owned by others for your own private use"]}
