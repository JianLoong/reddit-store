We have 4 lunch periods and my class has 3rd lunch. My phone had died so I decided I was gonna use my chromebook at lunch to pass the time. \n\nYou can see where this is going right? \n\nAnyways, at lunch, mindlessly scrolling through buzz feed, when suddenly, the tab closes. I thought maybe I had accidentally misclicked. I reopened the tap but it closes again. I was confused, so I tried opening other tabs to see if it was just that website, but nope. They all closed. After about 1 minute of confusion, I finally realized what was going on. \n\nI was furious. I closed my chromebook and finished lunch. When I went back to class I asked my teacher about it, he said that the chromebook was only to be used for school purposes. I told him that that wasn\u2019t fair because this was my leisure time and he should not be watching my chromebook in my personal time. He kept telling me the same things over and over so I just stayed quiet.\n\nI was still mad though, so during passing period. I took a trip to the principals office and reported him.  The principal said she would look into it.\n\nWhen I got home and told my mom about the situation, she said I overreacted.

Our principal is very fair and considers school policy and also fair treatment of students.\n\nAlso, as might not surprise you, we're very familiar with all of the bullshit that high school students pull.\n\nSo basically, if you're right, your principal will talk to your teacher and tell him what he is supposed to do. If you're wrong, your principal will tell you that you were mistaken about policy. Either way, you're unlikely to get in trouble and should consider it a learning experience.\n\nNAH", "NAH. Teacher here, he\u2019s definitely not the AH for closing your tabs during class. It\u2019s extremely frustrating when students are constantly on the wrong page.

I have other things to do, lol.", "Info: When you were assigned the computer at the beginning of the year, did you have to sign something stating school use only, were told by the person who gave it to you at the school that it was school use only, etc? Like is this a known policy school-wide?", "INFO: please provide clarification on your schools tech use policies. \n\nWithout knowing your schools rules for tech usage it\u2019s hard to give a proper judgement. Seems like a pretty petty thing to report a teacher for but if you\u2019re allowed to do whatever on the device outside of class then it\u2019s justified. If the rules say that they\u2019re only to be used for school then yeah y t a. \n\nEither way count yourself lucky that you even have Chromebook\u2019s or can use your phones during school.", "INFO: does the Chromebook belong to the school? Are there policies you agreed to before being able to use the Chromebook? Did you violate those policies?", "NTA - You\u2019re 15. Good move discussing with the principal and your mom. \n\nHowever, if the school owns the device then they can/will impose restrictions on how it can be used. Same as if you had a laptop provided by a future employer.\n\nIt\u2019s a life lesson.

You need to find another way to pass the time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: When I was in high school we used to try to \"hack\" ways to use MySpace. Every \"hack\" we found eventually got banned by the school IP. We didn't complain to the principal that we couldn't get on MySpace, we just kept getting more creative. Looks like the schools got more creative in return. It is what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA2: Just to be clear, yes I think the teacher is micromanaging", "I do think it's odd and possibly creepy that he's watching what you (and most likely everyone else) are doing, but there is probably a disclaimer somewhere that states you have no expectation of privacy on the school's equipment. This is true for most corporate and government devices as well, but the watchdogs aren't nearly this vigilant. Your best bet is to find a good book to hang out with during your downtime at school. I'm sorry for you, though. I wouldn't be 15 again for all the money in the country.", "NTA. \n\nAs a parent of kid in 6th grade with a school-issued chromebook, I think this is way out of bounds. \n\nThe school will have blocks on any non-approved websites. (Ours can't get into Pokemon for example, because it's highly distracting.)  The kids are allowed to access approved websites on their own time. They also take their chromebooks home and use them for non-school activities. \n\nIt sounds like not only is the teacher overstepping his bounds on how kids use the chromeboook, but that he also had remote access to OP's chromebook, and was monitoring her usage during her free time. That is creepy, and completely unacceptable. How did he get this access? Is he also part of the IT staff? He is abusing his position as a teacher and his access to the school network. \n\nUnless this school has a very strict policy on chromebook usage during free time, and unless this teacher has explicit rights to monitor and access students' laptops, he is way out of bounds.", "Dude was watching his students while on lunch.", "NTA.\n\nYou will never be the asshole for reporting something to authority figures. If they did something wrong, they will get reprimanded. If they did nothing wrong, nothing will happen to them. Either way you're in the clear.", "I'm not going to call you an ahole for this, but you and your parents likely agreed that it would be used only for school purposes, which buzzfeed is not.  You're not going to get the teacher in trouble for this.   Id bet money that the principal probably won't even bring it up to the teacher.   \n\nIt's a lesson you'll need to learn.   Using a school or work computer will almost assuredly be monitored on some level.   Use your phone for your leisure browsing.", "maybe next time use your chromebook to charge your phone", "NTA.\n\nIf the principal said \"I'll look into it\" instead of \"that's not what the chromebooks are for\", than I assume that means browsing the internet during your free period is allowed.\n\nEven if the teacher is technically correct, a good principal will want to know if he's being a wierd jerk about it, because that can be indicative of other issues", "Info: Does the school have a rule about using it for personal use? If they do and it's not allowed  YTA. We had strict guidelines for using our laptops at school, and same with our work ones.", "Was there any type of use agreement for the equipment?", "NTA. You reporting it is fine. The principal can decide whether it was according to the rules or not.", "INFO: Who bought the chromebook?", "NTA\n\nI was issued an iPad at 14 by my hs. They understood that we were kids and told us that they knew we\u2019re gonna mess around on them. Of course some kids tried porn sites but oop they were blocked. If your school thought it was THAT serious they would\u2019ve previously blocked sites they didn\u2019t want you on. some people forget that we\u2019re human and there\u2019s no way to ONLY focus on school for 8hrs or work for that long. was defs creepy of him to be actively monitoring your activity while not in his class.", "INFO: does your teacher keep such a watchful eye on all of his other pupils? Have you been in trouble before for using the laptop to look up anything concerning/inappropriate that would cause a teacher to monitor your usage closely?", "NAH. Everyone will get clarification soon enough what school policies are if they were not clear.", "NTA. From the sounds of it, you didn't talk back to the teacher nor explode on the principal by calling the teacher names. The principal said they'd look into it, and hopefully this results in a school wide policy regarding chromebook use. However I have a feeling that the result will be that school property only be used for school work, thus you won't get to use them leisurely.", "I remember when I was in high school and had a school issued laptop, the rule was as long nothing illegal was being done on the computer than there is no real issue, sometimes research for different projects can look like \u201cpersonal time\u201d so we were given leeway. Most websites that we aren\u2019t allowed to visit were blocked anyways, like Facebook and others so if this school really wanted to prevent students from using the Chromebook\u2019s for personal time they would\u2019ve had blocked sites. NTA.", "So as a former teacher I can say in my experience, as long as you weren't on an inappropriate site - dating, porn, hate, etc. and weren't trying to download things no one really cared. Pretty sad he had nothing better to do during lunch. I was strict but not a dick like that.\n\nIs there a school policy, if so you may have over reacted but still, NTA. Even without a policy it's not like the principle is going to do any formal disciplining.", "NTA, wtf?", "INFO: who bought the Chromebook, the school or you (your family, I mean)? Also, do you bring this Chromebook home with you (regardless of who bought it)?", "Your Mom is right, you can't complain when you used it for reasons other than what it is assigned for. The school has every right to monitor what students do on school Chromebooks. Just like an employer has the right to monitor work computers and emails. See it as a life lesson and move on. Soft YTA.", "NTA. I think it's a good thing the principal knows about this. There need to be clear rules about this. You should also know when you can be monitored. This needs more discussion and regulation.", "NTA\n\nThe teacher has the power to monitor and affect the computers so that he can make sure they are used appropriately during class. It seems that he has gone on a power trip, however, and taken it upon himself to govern their usage at all times.\n\nThat is not his job, and it was not why he was given monitoring authority.\n\nNote:\n\n>If we finish with our work and try and do other homework, he closes out those tabs and tells us to just close our chromebooks.\n\nHe is actually preventing students from using the chromebook for school work because it offends his sense of propriety. He is TA for this reason.\n\n>She said that the computer was only for school use and I should not be using it for anything else.\n\nThe terms for use should be spelled out in the user agreement.\n\nIt is not at all unusual for schools to allow laptops to be used for personal reasons, so long as they don't interfere with school work. So don't visit suspicious websites, and don't goof off during class and you are fine.\n\nIf your school has a different, stricter policy then you are obliged to some degree to follow it. I will say, however, that I think a stricter policy would be stupid and controlling, unless it is a response to a specific problem.", "NTA \n\nWhen I was in 8th grade I entered a program called \u201cblended learning\u201d where I was given my own MacBook. I was allowed to use it for leisure (especially when I was home) but the teachers had a right to check what we were doing during THEIR CLASS TIME and close our tabs that were deemed distracting. \n\nYour teacher is doing a power move. While it is a school computer, it\u2019s your leisure time. Plus, it\u2019s creepy that he\u2019s monitoring you like that. Don\u2019t listen to all the other commenters trying to make you feel bad.", "Yikes. Some of these takes are nearly as creepy as the teacher. \n\nWhy is he so hyper focused on this student. That he is watching/stalking her even when she is at lunch? \n\nLots of people keep saying she should only use it for school work but I guess you missed the part where he closes those windows out if she finishes his work. \n\nAlso, I am certain the school has filters on the computer to clock websites they deem inappropriate. So if the computer allows her to go to buzz feed on her free time, then it\u2019s none of his business. \n\nLastly, he has no clue whether she is researching something for a class and needs to visit non educational websites. \n\nHe is massively overstepping boundaries and is more than a bit of a creep.", "NTA: While you may be wrong for using the computer for non-school use in your leisure time, that is entirely up to your school and parents to decide. What you are absolutely not an AH for is bringing a potential over-reach of a teachers authority to their supervisors attention. It is their job to ensure that all school employees are following the school policies properly. If the teacher did not overstep their authority, then nothing adverse will happen to them for your action. I would suggest that you look into your schools policies and verifying what you are, and are not allowed to do with the computer, and when before using it outside of instruction again. The best rebuke against over-reach of petty authority is being able to quote and source the relevant rules.", "Need more info about this. Is there a general school rule that says you cant use it for personal stuff? If yes, YTA and you need to respect the school rules and his authority. If he chooses to be lenient and let you do whatever, then everyone is happy. If not and he chooses to be strict, then sucks for you guys.", "[deleted]", "Your lunch is your time but that Chromebook doesn't belong to you so", "The only way to determine if you're the AH is what the principal does about it. If they side with you, that means the teacher was being too strict. If they don't, that means the teacher was in their rights.", "NTA. If you had truly overreacted, the principal would have told you that school policy supports the teacher. There's really no reason for that teacher to be closing out tabs on your computer, even a school one, outside of his scheduled class time with you.\n\nThat being said, any computer provided by the school will be monitored, and most schools do have policies about what you can and can't do on it. So, for your benefit, I would make sure you familiarize yourself with those standards and stick to them. Your school could take your issued computer back if they felt you weren't treating it as a tool, although it's a pretty extreme measure that isn't likely to happen over something like browsing at lunch. If your teacher gets in trouble, he may be keeping a closer eye on you, though, so you should be aware.", "NTA. Very appropriate to report to the principal. Seems both the students and teachers need guidance of what is an acceptable and not acceptable use for the laptops at different times of day. Buzzfeed is not blocked and you are not in class, so I personally think browsing the internet outside of class is acceptable. Also think your teacher monitoring your browsing outside of class is overreach.", "NTA.\n\nIt's normal for schools to monitor internet use on school-issued laptops, but that's monitoring in the same way that parental control apps monitor. It's not normal for one particular teacher to randomly decide to go see what one student is doing in her lunch time. At worst it's creepy, at best it's needlessly intrusive.", "NTA. My kid (14F) has a Chromebook for school from the school and no one polices what they do on it outside of class short of standard child protections (no porn, no violent stuff, etc.). For many students, the school-issued Chromebook is their only computer. It would like be unrealistic and silly to expect them to NEVER use it for non-school things, especially when not on school time.", "NTA, lots of people claiming YTA but this teacher doesn\u2019t even allow you to work on other assignments when you\u2019re done with his. I do think it\u2019s weird this teacher spends his time monitoring your computer and telling your principal isn\u2019t overkill.

You\u2019re literally in the middle of lunch, I\u2019m honestly laughing at how unrealistic everyone else is being about this. Lunch time is break time, I cannot possibly see how giving yourself time to unwind during YOUR break would be an issue.

I think you overreacted and what you did was pointless. Its school equipment, monitoring you is normal, unfortunately.\n\nThe teacher is probably an asshole.

If the teacher is not acting within their scope, then it's even better to bring this to the administration's attention. Possible outcomes should be corrective action against the teacher if warranted or educating the student on the policies. There should not be any negative consequences for the student for reporting events.\n\nPersonally, I think real time monitoring of school issued devices without reasonable cause for concern is creepy at best. It's one thing to run reports on the sites students are visiting to ensure they are not engaging in dangerous behavior. It's another to watch students as they browse and access things like personal email or chat programs where sensitive info may be revealed. And either way, the policy on monitoring devices should be clear and readily accessible (not just a form signed once at the beginning of the year).

I'm not sure what I would do or recommend my kids do, but informing the principal that a teacher is monitoring computer use while not in class seems reasonable.", "At my school we all got iPads from middle school to hs graduation and we were allowed to go on Facebook or even have apps on them and allowed to use them during school times.

So it's like a blanket you agreed to your activity to be monitored when you take the equipment out. \n\nAnother comment also mentioned that some places, there's an app that notifies the teacher when school computers are being used so it might just be that the teacher got a notice that the chrome book is in use when it's not class time so he went to take a look whats going on.", "Ours actually allowed teachers to monitor us when in a certain range and even lock a screen with a pre-determined image.

Teacher might just be getting an alert of some kind when the device is in use to monitor it.

OP is just mad she can\u2019t dick around on a screen. She could\u2019ve just chatted with friends during lunch instead of bringing a whole ass chromebook.    \nBut additionally, the teacher was probably eating lunch. I\u2019d sooner bet buzzfeed was just blocked on the school\u2019s wifi, and OP blamed her teacher because she doesn\u2019t like that he\u2019s strict. Honestly, in a school large enough to have 4 lunch blocks, that level of strictness is not surprising.

I assume remote monitoring let's you see everything they're doing, not just programs/tabs open... maybe it's just me, but if the kid was writing an essay I would also take issue with a teacher checking in and seeing a working a draft during lunch when it's not in a place to get turned in. Lots of times kids put lines in essays like \"this essay is stupid\" that I think they deserve to not have their teacher see if they take it out by the time they turn it in. \n\nThat said, when I was in school, the school only provided computer labs with desktops in limited numbers.", "If the school owns the Chromebooks (and presumably the network they are on) the school has every right to the device.

There is a code of conduct, of course, and it does speak about blocked sites, but it doesn't say kids can't do what OP was doing. \n\nI realize this is purely anecdotal and could be specific to my country and state but it also could be that OP and their parents signed a similar document. \n\nAlso, it's possible that Buzzfeed could be used for research purposes in certain senarios.

My kid is a Mac user. I asked the principal if my kid could use their Mac  book instead because all the art classes they took were not supported by chrome. The principal said no. I told the principal it was not for personal use but to work on art projects in down time.  His response was that the other classes should have no down time and if there was, they should go to the computer lab to do said work. Well, the high school is rather large and more time would have been spent getting to and from the lab. The work around, my kid was friendly with the school hackers and provided my kid with the WiFi password to log in to the schools systems.  Did I have a problem with this, no. If my kid used it for personal reasons, then there would be a problem. Moral of my story, school computers come with terms.  Follow them. Personal do not.  When my kid did graduate with honors the principal told me I should be proud that my kid graduated with honors following the rules.  My response, there is always a work around. He was curious and asked what I meant.  I told him the school did a great job educating the hackers. There are still students that find a work around.

I can see how you already aren\u2019t a big fan of rules. You will need to fix that if you want an easier life.", "Sorry, YTA.

Unless you have an A+ in that class, you should be using your time to review the materials for that course.", "Oh yeah, you definitely are the AH here.\r  \n\r  \nA teacher is allowed to be strict. I am also a teacher but work for a college. To be perfectly honest, the more strict the teacher, usually the better the student's marks. This typically goes hand in hand. As such, this teacher has already received the principal\u2019s respect with these results.\r  \n\r  \n1)\tA teacher typically works under a union and is protected by the union. The principal cannot fire the teacher. This would be done by the board. A complaint should have been provided to the board. You report student behaviour to the principal, not teacher behaviour. The principal\u2019s job is to support her/his teachers and act in student affairs.\r  \n2)\tComputers should be monitored to ensure students are doing their work and not using the school\u2019s resources for personal use. This would include using school electricity to charge your phone, using the internet to check your email, using the unpaid printer to print music lyrics, etc.\r  \n3)\tYou failed to provide details. The Chromebook you were using, was it was purchased by you? Or was it provided by the school? If it was provided by the school then it is school property and they can put whatever rules, regulations, and set privileges to their computers. You have rules at your home, regarding your property. The school also has rules regarding its property. When you get a job, the computer you are provided will also have rules, regulations, and privileges. At my work, even our printer has rules regarding privileges.  This is part of the adult world.\r  \n4)\tPart of the adult world is also about forming routines. This would include ensuring that your phone is charged.\r  \n5)\tAs the phone is your property, you can use it, however, you see fit so ensure that it is charged!  That\u2019s your responsibility!  Just do not use the school\u2019s internet. Using the school\u2019s internet while everyone else is using the same internet could also risk your safety, so use your data instead. Do not use the school\u2019s internet for personal use. This is provided to you for educational purposes only. Therefore, make sure that your phone is charged!\r  \n6)\tIf the school provided you with the Chromebook, they would have a policy that it is only used for educational purposes that is tied to your school. In using it for personal use, you are breaking policy. If the procedure is to close tabs to not allow students to use the Chromebooks for personal use, then you are actually going against school policies and procedures. Your job, as a student, is to adhere to the policies and procedures set out by the school. In fact, your parents probably even signed a school contract that states that you will abide by all rules, policies, and procedures. \r  \n7)\tDid you even read the policy and procedure regarding Chromebook use? By law, if you request one, they have to provide it. This is typically the first step BEFORE submitting any complaint. Again, this is part of the adult world. You don\u2019t go running to an authority figure to verbally\" tell\" on someone. That would be something children do. If there is nothing within the policy and procedure regarding using the Chromebook for personal use, you are to submit a complaint form to the board. A complaint is ALWAYS in written form.  If there is a policy and procedure in place regarding personal use, then you must adhere to this. But then you could challenge this with the board. Should they decide, they can revise the policy and procedure, but a motion has to be made.\r  \n8)\tPart of the adult work and time to start learning this quickly: life is rarely (if ever) fair. Fair only exists in preschool where a child divides their cookies with their peers equally. You are 15 now, so those days have been over for quite some time.\r  \n9)\tIf you were provided personal time, you should be using personal devices. When you are provided educational teaching time, use private school devices. It sounds like you were on school property during your lunch break. Therein lies the issue. Their house, their rules. Go to a coffee shop or a nearby friend's place instead.\r  \n10)\tA principal usually has the teacher\u2019s back. When a principal says, \u201cthey\u2019ll look into it\u201d, they will probably buy that teacher a coffee.\r  \n11)\tYou got frustrated, furious, and mad. Your words. Has anyone ever thought or done anything clearly when they were frustrated, furious, and mad? This is why it is essential to take time, take a breath, and cool down before saying and doing anything, However, there are adults who still have not learned this.\r  \n12)\tAll young people and teenagers should have their internet use monitored. You may call this creepy, as a teenager. However, it stems from caring for you and being concerned. There are a lot of predators out there and cyberbullying has increased exponentially.  Many parents would be pleased that this was being monitored and have some solace that their children were safe and protected.  You are being very selfish for not recognizing this and only thinking about yourself and your computer usage.\n\nThat makes you the AH.

At some point every youtube video was blocked until a teacher approved it. Also they said you can use it in your leisure time with the approved sites. Therefore it was almost nothing.

It is absolutely weird that he was checking her activity at lunch.", "I know our school district is school stuff only and they can monitor it at any time.", "Even if it is, if OP would like the policy to be revised going to the principal is the right way to handle it regardless. The principal can decide whether what that teacher did is appropriate.", "Info determines the teacher\u2019s status, but I\u2019d add that OP is NTA regardless. When weird stuff happens to you as a student, report to an authority figure and let them handle it. Students probably don\u2019t know school policies very well, but the principal does and would (theoretically) take the appropriate course of action from here, probably clarifying with the teacher what exactly happened to determine whether they were just following policy or overstepping.", "As a teacher: nobody enforces any kind of rule like this, even when it exists.

I'm highly confident that the district is not employing this teacher to spend non-class time looking at what students are doing on their laptops.\n\nDistricts want to limit their liability from students accessing the internet, but they do not want to be in the business of manually monitoring every individual student. The efficient manner of restricting access is to USE TECHNOLOGY. District system administrators can block sites it doesn't want students to access.\n\nDistricts usually have students and parents sign a document saying that they HAVE RECEIVED AND READ policy regarding use of school laptops. If that didn't happen, if the policy isn't posted online or wasn't provided in a written form, then it's hard for the district to claim that this is an enforceable policy.\n\nAlso, I personally have not heard of a school district that gives students laptops to take home (yes, for schoolwork) and does not allow them to EVER use it to go to websites other than classroom pages.

The reason the school provides teachers with apps like go guardian that can monitor and close windows is to close out tabs when students should be doing something else. Parents (and sometimes the student also) must sign releases when they are given the Chromebook from the school stating that they are responsible for damage and will not access anything other than school approved content. \n\nIt is difficult to block YouTube and other sites for all students because teachers use those sites for lessons and research. \n\nThe idea that a student is entitled to \u201cleisure time\u201d while on campus is false. In fact, we suspended a student for viewing explicit music videos on a school Chromebook even though they were at home when they did so. \n\nBecause if we didn\u2019t and a parent tried to sue us for providing the means for their child to access harmful content, we would have little defense without those Chromebook releases. \n\nWe are the 5th largest, but worlds poorest run school district. I also taught in a tiny school district in another state at the beginning of the Chromebook buying spree and they also had these releases. Most parents sign the paper along with a giant stack at the beginning of school. \n\nWe did not allow chromebooks at breakfast or lunch because that increases the chance something will get spilled on them. \n\nI can almost guarantee the principal doesn\u2019t care that this teacher closed your tabs. Most will say something to make you feel heard, but don\u2019t do anything. In fact in your case, I\u2019d hope they didn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019ve never understood why students and parents think it\u2019s a good idea to try and get teachers in trouble in such vocal ways that lead back to them easily. Do you think it endears you to the teacher? What exactly is your goal here? Because if the goal was to ensure your teacher scrutinizes you more heavily in order to catch and record when you break the rules so he can cover his own behind if your parent backs you up, congratulations, that\u2019s the most positive outcome I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019ve also seen teachers flat out target kids because they or their parent complained. \n\nMost teachers are not as easy to get fired as kids like to think. He\u2019s likely tenured, and even if he isn\u2019t, he\u2019s likely protected by a union. \n\nI know my response might sound harsh, but the world of education is harsh. It\u2019s part of why I quit teaching. Teachers that actually care for the students and try to help them end up targeted by admin or parents. Teachers that try to appease parents end up hated by the students and fellow teachers. And no one likes the teachers that only try to please administrators. Not even the administrators. \n\nAlso, depending on the app they have to close tabs it is possible the teacher has it set to lock out everything or certain websites during certain hours. Whenever we had a test our principal made us lock the Chromebook\u2019s out of accessing any websites. The students could open one, it would be up for less than a minute and then shut. It\u2019s entirely possible the teacher did this because it would be really odd and a lot of work to sit there during lunch and monitor the windows.

Parents do not want their children looking at whatever they like on school computers.", "I didn't have this setup when I was a teacher, but my colleague did and she could see all the computers at once. \n\nFirst off, he was probably teaching another class at the time. There are different lunch periods, so lunch for one group is class for another. He probably wasn't monitoring students on HIS lunch, just monitoring as part of his class, and saw it as one more extra tab. \n\nHe might not have known OP was at lunch (as opposed to in another class) and probably just saw a site that wasn't allowed, and closed it. \n\nThat being said, the school should be clear whether the chromebooks are allowed to be used for fun after your work is done or in your free time. Most schools I know don't allow this. \n\nThe school should have been clearer on their policy, but OP doesn't NEED a screen to look at during lunch, and this certainly isn't what the chromebooks were meant for. \n\nHowever, it does seem like the teacher is particularly a dick about it.", "Except the teacher complained even when she tried to use it for other homework.", "As others have stated, would the principal have not told him then and there they shouldn't have been using the computer for that purpose if that was the case?", "In order to maintain cyber security insurance ( and requirements by some of the grants used to purchase these massive amounts of devices purchased during the pandemic), schools are REQUIRED to put in place various safeguards such as filters and monitoring software. The district policy may have teachers assigned at various times to enforce this with the use of software. Students and parents are usually required to sign Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) stating they will only use it for appropriate purposes (school work).  Schools got lots of pandemic grants for these purchases that have strict guidelines on how equipment can be used. Oftentimes the principal might not be aware of all the requirements, but the IT department will. School computer, school network- follow the rules. And remember- it can be taken away at anytime for any reason and the district has the ability/right to scrutinize every single action completed with the device. I guess the bottom line is-Don\u2019t forget your phone again!", "There have been multiple recorded instances of remote camera access being abused so please be extra cognizant of that.", "I was a teacher for 10 years and the answer is: this is creepy as fuck behavior and not something any normal teacher would ever have time to do unless they specifically set out to do it. Not in a million years would I be looking at a students' screen while they were on lunch.", "In the UK they have to inform you they are monitoring your computer but the employee can\u2019t object unless they want to keep their job. We do have employment rights.", "Ehh. It could totally be a security issue though depending on what they\u2019re doing. Even if they are being responsible.", "Eh.  It's during lunch.  It shouldn't matter if OP is just screwing around.", "I think that's because the people on this post don't actually understand how remote access works, and that you *very much* have to go out of your way to use it. He probably had to specifically activate it in that moment, with the intention of spying on OP's computer use, outside of class hours.\n\nThey probably also haven't considered the potential that these laptops could have webcams. Because if the teacher has remote access to every student's computer, he *also* has access to their webcams. And probably their log-in details for every site they access on that computer. Which becomes kind of a big deal when you factor in that many schools want you to use your personal social media for school, now (I had many teachers demand this when I was in high school over ten years ago) - so there's a solid chance he now has access to their *personal* social media accounts, too.", "You\u2019re right that there isn\u2019t an expectation of privacy, but from a policy standpoint, it\u2019s terrible to have teachers monitoring kids who aren\u2019t physically in their presence. All school districts have content filters that should be preventing the really bad stuff from coming through. Teachers simply shouldn\u2019t have time to be nosing into screens outside of class time.", "Okay but having teachers monitor every single student's laptop use every single hour of the school day is kinda ridiculous. It's not fair to the *teachers*, let alone the students. Don't they have other shit to do than stare at a screen?\n\nIf the school genuinely wants to control use to that degree (and it doesn't sound like they do, and I've honestly never heard of a school that *does*) then the obvious solution here is to install the easily available software designed for that very purpose. \n\nThere is *no way* the school is telling this teacher to personally watch the screens all the time - that is not part of his job, because it makes zero sense for that to be his job. He is going outside of the duties he has actually been given by the school, for the express purpose of monitoring students in a way that he has *not* been instructed to do. That's creepy, and possibly illegal - governments are *very* fucking strict about teachers going outside of their job duties, particularly where students are concerned, because it is very easy for that to lead to crimes being committed.", "Reading some of these comments makes me very glad I graduated high school well before the advent of kids having chrome books.   We didn't have computers to do our work on or anything like that.  If a teacher is creeping on students' devices during their lunch break is .. gross.", "It's not admin doing this though, it is a teacher. Even if this was a policy sites would most likely already be blocked especially something as popular as buzzfeed and it would be under IT's purview not a single teacher. And lets say it was the teachers responsibility the principal would be 100% aware of that because she would be either leading or at meeting involving it.", "I can\u2019t help but ask why this teacher took the time out of his day to shut down your screen while you weren\u2019t in his class. Not only is it an overreach of power but it\u2019s creepy. I would ask to see if anyone else\u2019s tabs were closed too or was he just watching yours.", "Have you considered bringing up that you feel uncomfortable with an older man like that monitoring your device outside of school hours and doing so without you being able to know? He has access to your camera and microphone and IS monitoring you outside of his work hours. That's pretty creepy and as a young woman you being uncomfortable with it holds more weight than a young man having that problem", "I would cover the webcam anyways. Better safe than spied on.", "At my school there are programs (designed mostly for testing on ipads) that show an exact image of the screen we are looking at, if he was closing windows it is probably something akin to that", "See, I never really understood that, especially from an education standpoint. The access to information, not only academic, but also just current events and that kind of thing that is really important for every member of our society to know, is right at these kids finger tips, and there teachers honestly don't see the educational value in that??? Yeah, no, fuck that, that's a dumb-shit policy.\n\nOf course ban websites like pornhub and other stuff like that, but it's so easy to just make those websites inaccessible from the device anyway. I honestly don't think this is the kind of thing that you can assign a black and white \"has a right to\" or doesn't on this situation; access to information like news websites, online encyclopedias, civil opinion and discourse articles and so on, should be a right all on their own, for everyone to stay informed and gain perspective outside their local echo chambers. I really do think the school is failing these kids by failing to provide that.", "Just commented this, but just cut a small piece of card from a cereal box or something else and use whatever tape you have on hand, just in case you cannot get your hands on opaque tape. Plus, it leaves no residue on the lens.", "Also check too hear if there is an access log being kept to track how and when teachers are using their privileges.   \nNTA", "At lunch in our school, students are not allowed electronics period because of the number of kids involved in cyberbullying. Yes, it is OK to monitor what they do at lunch\u2026 not any different than stopping bullying that is happening face to face.", "Teacher here. We can monitor the student because we are acting under the legality of In loco parentis. This refers to the legal responsibility of some person or organization to perform some of the functions or responsibilities of a parent.   \n\n\nThere is no expectation of privacy using a school owned computer. Period. If it was their cell phone, t hen depending on school policy it can be confiscated but not searched through.", "Oh I must\u2019ve skimmed over the fact that she had scrolled for awhile - thought it was just immediately kicking her off. My bad. Although that does probably mean he wasn\u2019t watching the whole time, and only started kicking her off when lunch was about over", "I do and do not miss the days of MySpace, LiveJournal, and Xanga lol\n\nMavis Beacon typing.  The one trivia game thing in Encarta Encyclopedia.\n\nOr when RPG chat forums were a huge thing.  Are those still a thing that exists?\n\nYukon trail, Oregon trail.\n\nGod, I was one of the OG people in the cyanide and happiness forum and used to MSN chat with so many strangers LOL", "I am so so so thankful I don't have to attend public school in this day and age. Everything about it just seems terrible. We had so much more freedom and I think we were better off for it. Of course, it's all entirely on purpose. They're training the population to accept constant surveillance and control. And it's working.", "School principal, here\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. If the laptop belongs to the school, then the school can dictate what it\u2019s used for. In fact, I would think your school has an Acceptable Use Policy for technology which states that the Chromebook is a learning device only and to be used as such.\nJust a hunch. But I could be wrong.", "Don't worry about it. When a principal says \"I'll look into it\" she really means \"IDGAF\".", "We\u2019re already having a meeting tomorrow morning to discuss.", "If whatever software the laptop has just gives the teacher power to control the mouse, it doesn't matter if they can see the student's webcam at all times because all they have to do is initiate the webcam application to turn it on. While it's totally possible they'd lack the access to initiate such an application I'd want to make sure.", "Ah, I see. I was thinking more about quizzes and paper assignments that you turn in, where you don\u2019t get to redo it at a later time", "I don't think OP cares she was being monitored, but that she was being fucked with. If you are sitting at your desk on lunch, your free leisure time, I don't know a single employer that will prevent you from reading the news headlines or checking out buzzfeed."]}
