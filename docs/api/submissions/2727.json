I started an online clothing store recently and it\u2019s going well thankfully. \n\nMy mom was/is very supportive but when sales really started coming in it was like a fire was lit under her.

He got some unsettling health news he\u2019s dealing with. An unsupportive family and has wanted to move to be closer for a while. Every time I tell him about something going on with my business he get annoyed like I\u2019m doing something wrong. The other day I told him I had to deal with my first customer service issue and he literally started yelling saying you need to listen because that could hurt your business. He has told me countless times when my business starts making more he will come down to help me out. I used my friend t as a sounding board a couple times. I asked him if the name was good if a couple product photos looked good and he now thinks he started the whole company and put all the money and work in. It gets annoying because he has done nothing but say that looks good or maybe not that. \n\nI really feel as though people are going to try to \u201chelp\u201d me but actually use my business for their own needs. I\u2019ve decided to stop talking to my family and friends about my business at all. I will let them know generally what\u2019s going on but only if they ask. I just want to know if I\u2019m being an asshole for doing that or if that sound okay. My only issue is I\u2019ve never owned a company and it\u2019s hard to know what to do sometimes so getting another opinion help greatly but I\u2019ll have to decide for myself.", "created_utc": 1668858191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yza0vl/aita_for_not_accepting_help_from_family_or/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get your advice from elsewhere. Do you have a mentor or someone else who has experience in something similar but totally unrelated (e.g.  online flower sales)?", "NTA. I suspect that you are right - they will try to insert themselves and make your business about them. I don't have any experience in this field, but I imagine you'd be better getting some independent advice, support or mentoring, even if you have to pay for it.", "NTA. Its pretty common that ppl overvalue their input when something becomes a success. You should probably nip that in the bud and set your friend straight next time he brings it up. You could do that easily by saying something like \"That's funny. I thought I built it since I was the once who spent all the hours and money on it. But yeah, you did say which pictures you liked better, that's true\". \n\n\nYou'll do much better taking advice and using online startup forums as sounding boards.", "Nta. Don't let anyone in. I started a business and people laughed at me because I would fail. It was a success and now everyone wants a piece of it! Not because they want to help me, because it's successful and they want to be able to claim it themselves. Keep everyone out and just do your own thing. You obviously know what you are doing as it's working right? Ignore them and keep on being great alone.", "Honestly? Hard to tell! Because you are definately percieving that your friends and families 'help' isn't helpful, and you are suspicious of thier motives. But that doesn't mean that it's NOT coming from a good place. It DOES mean that you aren't open to their advice.  \nso, the only solution is that you don't ask for their advice, and gently tell them that you want to keep your business life and your personal life separate - and then actually do so.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. Even family and close friends can get weird when money and success is involved. Lots of feelings come up, and they\u2019re not all good. There is absolutely nothing wrong with setting these boundaries.\n\nI\u2019d definitely stop talking about business unless it\u2019s just to tell them it\u2019s going well.", "It sounds like your business taking off is starting to attract leeches, users and opportunists. You're wise to keep people away, it does sound like they're trying to use your biz for personal gain.", "Something tells me they were annoyed with you because you talked about your business all the time. Which is understandable since you\u2019re proud of it. As your business grows, so will the people who want to take advantage of your success, so be careful. If you\u2019re so indecisive or unsure, it may be time to hire a marketing firm or consultant. NTA", "NtA.  You want to feel like it's yours and that you own it, completely understandable. \n\nAnd sometimes, some people that give advise or help out, do this and they throw it in your face or take ownership of your successes, as if without them you would not have achieved this level of success. Don't keep these people around you, they tend to suck the joy out of your achievements.", "NTA, businesses are like kids. Everyone has an opinion, and you get to decide whose advice you want to listen to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
