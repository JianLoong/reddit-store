What did they expect you to say? \u201cBirds\u201d?", "Lol, I learnt that word in primary school. Cousin is just insecure.", "NTA. It sounds like your grandmother had no issues with learning new vocabulary and you cousin is eaten up with jealousy over your achievements. What a shame he has such a small mind. If the rest of the family can\u2019t be proud of you, that\u2019s their problem. I\u2019ve seen this play out in families before and it\u2019s ugly how people will turn on their own family members for daring to go further in life. Keep your focus on your academic and career goals and don\u2019t give these jerks any more headspace.", "NTA. Don\u2019t ever hide your intellect or education. You\u2019d only be doing it to make others feel better and it\u2019ll make you feel worse.", "This.  One of my cousins died my sophomore year.  My other cousin had married at 19 and had a baby at 20.  The whole family was sitting around the day before the funeral and other cousin was complaining she couldn't go to the funeral because the baby had colic and would disrupt the ceremony.  I said I'd stay with the baby so she could go to the funeral.  I told her I should study anyway.  (This was a lie -- it was between semesters and I was just trying to give her a gracious out for leaving the baby with me.)  She responded, \"Oh yeah, throw that in my face too!  You and your fancy college education!\"  My head snapped back like I had been slapped.  Most of the other relatives smirked at me.  Fine.  I went to the funeral and she stayed hope with a colicky baby.", "She taught me how to bake, she's always sharing little secrets :) One of which I'll put here. For great chocolate chip cookies, equal parts golden brown sugar and refined white sugar.", "Please don't let the rest of your family's reactions hamper your excitement for your education and learning more broadly. You did absolutely nothing wrong in this situation. \n\nI love how happy you were to share your knowledge with your grandma. Do not hide that joy from anyone. Your cousin sucks but that's a HIM problem, not a YOU problem!\n\nEDIT. I think your cousin was trying to make you feel small. You are flourishing and that can be irrationally threatening to small men. Making you feel small helps them feel big. Never make yourself smaller for someone else. Continue to grow and shine!", "I love this for you!! I love your username haha ornithology is cool and I\u2019m happy your grandma seems so supportive \ud83d\udc96\nI\u2019ve been in a similar position, only one to graduated on mom\u2019s side and first one to graduate college on dads with both large families and it was really alienating. Continue your passions and it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s family but i hope this doesn\u2019t bother you down the line. It really reeks of insecurity of lack of resources and jealousy that you were getting attention haha nothing to do with you \ud83e\udec2 wishing you the best obviously NTA", "I hope she takes advantage of that program! My grandma took advantage of a similar setup as soon as she was old enough because she'd always wanted to learn geology but when she was a kid that just wasn't a common path for girls. It made her so happy and she shared it with all her grandkids.", "If she audits classes (not interested in a degree) there are TONS of places and programs where she can learn for free, or nearly free. And education is great for extending health and life span!", "I'm into a lot of things nature related but birds and moths are my favorites. In fact I have a lighting set up on my back porch to see what kind of moths I can attract.", "I hope your grandma loves rocks as much as my grandma loves history, politics and plants. (She wants to take history, politics and botany classes)", "Autocarrot", "I used to get this from *my father* when he was alive. In the sense of \"look at the university student gracing us with her presence\" sense. When he died and we cleaned out his office we found a ton of hardcover leatherbound books, unread, that he'd obviously purchased to *look* well-read. I realized at that point that it had all been purely about jealousy and insecurity. And so it is with your cousin.\n\nFirmly NTA", "This word was used by Agatha Christie countless times in her books and she didn\u2019t write for an academic demographic.", "NTA. You offered to explain it, and I\u2019m pretty sure they have access to google", "You said the name of your class. NTA", "NTA.  Your cousin's an ignoramus, a dullard, a philistine, a galoot.", "It\u2019s not like you went in there to brain ninja you\u2019re family with surreptitious language. You simply described the study of birds from a scientific viewpoint to your curious grandmother. Sounds like cousin needs some word of the day toilet paper to keep up and you should continue to educate your lovely grandmother as much as she\u2019s willing to learn as she wasn\u2019t afforded the same opportunities.", "NTA. Those family members value education less than a normal person and that\u2019s on them. Your grandmother obviously loves it and I encourage you to regularly tell her about uni and all the new things you\u2019re learning.", "NTA I didn\u2019t go to Uni and I know what Ornithology is. Your cousin is just jealous and trying to drag you down.", "NTA. Please look up \"tall poppy syndrome\"", "NTA. To be honest I don't understand how Ornithology is a fancy, academic word. I come from a poor family and I haven't even finished school and as a kid I knew what's that.", "Posting on the top comment in case this get seen, but the story reads as made up to me. \n\nUni doesn't have science classes that an arts student would be required to take, anywhere in the UK. There are not classes to be \"well rounded\" you do you degree in the subject you chose and all modules are related to it", "I also come from a lower middle class family and am going to college. I think some of the folks who don't know some of the big words such as that would be interested and wouldn't feel looked down upon in my family. Cousin sounds like he is throwing a pity party and wants to stay in it. I know my late drop out father would hate his attitude despite him not having much interest in academics.", "*your, i\u2019m also dumb. :)", "That\u2019s awesome! Thank you for the tip! :)", "Not when his side of the family is attacking his daughter. Including his brother."]}
