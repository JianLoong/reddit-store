I'm studying English and have done some networking co-ops so I am assured a good job out of uni. I come from a lower middle-class family and I'm the first person on my father's side to go to university. Though I am studying an Arts degree, my university requires arts students to take some science classes, so that we can be well-rounded. I didn't like science very much in high school and took one computer science class in my first year, so I'm taking my second science this year. \n\nThis year, the biology department is offering an Ornithology class, or the study of birds, for arts students. I decided to swoop up a seat in the class because I love birds and I would love to learn more about them. \n\nAt my family reunion (Father's side) yesterday my grandmother was asking me about my classes, the only one who seemed genuinely interested. I listed off my English classes and then told her about Ornithology. She looked at me weird and so I explained the word. Her eyes opened wide and she asked me how to say it, so I taught her. She didn't finish high school but always wants to broaden her vocabulary. \n\nShe got it on her second or third try and I repeated it with her once she got it. She laughed and thanked me for teaching her something new but she had to check on her garlic beans which were roasting on the BBQ.\n\n I was sitting down when my cousin sat next to me. He also dropped out of high school. He glared at me and said \"So now miss fancy university is using words we can't understand.\"\n\nI asked him what he meant and he responded, \"You know you shouldn't use big words like that in front of family, you just think you're better than everyone else here because you're going to a big fancy school.\"\n\nI told him I had no intention of using words people didn't understand and would happily explain what words I used meant if he didn't know and he huffed. \"I ain't stupid, you're just an entitled college bitch now. I always knew you would be.\" Before I could say anything he walked away and told his dad. \n\nAfter I left the reunion due to uncomfortable stares my phone blew up calling me an upity asshole and a priss for using academic language in front of my family. I feel awful. I didn't do it on purpose to look smarter than other people I was just telling my grandmother about my fall classes and Ornithology was one of them.
