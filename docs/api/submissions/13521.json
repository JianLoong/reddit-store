{"id": 13521, "submission_id": "1262x7e", "title": "AITA for letting the neighbor kid\u2019s bike get stolen and not replacing it", "selftext": "My neighbors kids keep leaving things in our front yard. They leave toys, balls, frisbees, bikes and even one of those electric cars. It\u2019s a huge problem for us because we can never just leave the driveway without checking to see if it\u2019s clear and our lawn guy won\u2019t cut out grass if it is littered with stuff.\n\nWe have talked to their mother about the issue but nothing ever changed. We then resorted to harshly throwing their stuff in their own yard and also running their stuff over in our driveway. Of course some of their things got damaged and their mom would come yelling at us but we would just tell her if you keep their stuff out our yard this wouldn\u2019t happen. \n\nOne day I was leaving for an appointment and I saw one of their bikes in our yard. I was running late so I said I would deal with  it later. When I got back the bike was gone, I just assumed the mom had come get it. A couple minutes after the school bus passes the mom comes banging at my door asking for the bike. I told her it was gone by the time I got home. She didn\u2019t believe me and told me to have the bike back by tomorrow afternoon so she would call the police. I asked my husband if he knew anything and he said the same thing, it was there when he left and gone when he came back. While I don\u2019t have a security camera the neighbor across the street has one that catches half way into my yard. When I asked her to see the footage you could see a truck drive up to my yard a man get out and put the bike in his truck then drive off. When I got the mom to show her I thought she would apologize for accusing me and use this as a lesson for her kids. Instead she blamed me for leaving it out there and not moving it. She said if I don\u2019t replace the bike she will take legal action. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in the clear legally but maybe morally I\u2019m in the wrong. It\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault their mom refuses to teach them any better and I do move the bike every other time it\u2019s out there. The one time I don\u2019t it\u2019s get stolen and I do feel a bit upset especially since I know how it feels to have stuff stolen.", "created_utc": 1680129003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1262x7e/aita_for_letting_the_neighbor_kids_bike_get/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s a harsh, expensive lesson, but one hopefully they have learned.  Get a copy of the security cam to CYA.  They are already twisting the story.", "NTA\n\nHow could you possibly be responsible for someone else's stuff dumped into your yard without permission?   Perhaps you should threaten to countersue for harassment and the illegal dumping on your property.", "NTA. It didn't matter what lawn it was in, it was going to get stolen regardless because it was left out. Her kids negligence is not your problem.", "NTA. They abandoned their property, someone else took it. You have no liability. If they call the cops, tell the cops you want them all trespassed from your property and that if they leave anything else, it will be summarily discarded.", "NTA\n\nWow you have incredibly entitled neighbors! \n\nLet them call the cops. Enjoy the show. Then tell her you will be throwing all the stuff she leaves on your property into the trash when it isn't picked up daily.", "NTA:  \nYou are not responsible for other people's property, just because it was left in your yard.   \nAnd while I am not a lawyer, I am pretty sure that with the security cam from the neighbor, you are in the clear.   \n\n\nSometimes lessons are best  learned from loss.", "NTA.\nYour yard is not her kids' storage area.

I might be an a**hole but after talking to the mom once and it not being fixed I would have started throwing out or donating the toys.

Your neighbor is definitely an A H. Let her call the cops.. lol", "NTA She\u2019s too lazy to parent, so she\u2019s probably too lazy to sue you in a case that will get laughed out of court.", "NTA.
