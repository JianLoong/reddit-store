They leave toys, balls, frisbees, bikes and even one of those electric cars. It\u2019s a huge problem for us because we can never just leave the driveway without checking to see if it\u2019s clear and our lawn guy won\u2019t cut out grass if it is littered with stuff.\n\nWe have talked to their mother about the issue but nothing ever changed. We then resorted to harshly throwing their stuff in their own yard and also running their stuff over in our driveway. Of course some of their things got damaged and their mom would come yelling at us but we would just tell her if you keep their stuff out our yard this wouldn\u2019t happen. \n\nOne day I was leaving for an appointment and I saw one of their bikes in our yard. I was running late so I said I would deal with  it later. When I got back the bike was gone, I just assumed the mom had come get it. A couple minutes after the school bus passes the mom comes banging at my door asking for the bike. I told her it was gone by the time I got home. She didn\u2019t believe me and told me to have the bike back by tomorrow afternoon so she would call the police. I asked my husband if he knew anything and he said the same thing, it was there when he left and gone when he came back. While I don\u2019t have a security camera the neighbor across the street has one that catches half way into my yard. When I asked her to see the footage you could see a truck drive up to my yard a man get out and put the bike in his truck then drive off. When I got the mom to show her I thought she would apologize for accusing me and use this as a lesson for her kids. Instead she blamed me for leaving it out there and not moving it. She said if I don\u2019t replace the bike she will take legal action. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in the clear legally but maybe morally I\u2019m in the wrong. It\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault their mom refuses to teach them any better and I do move the bike every other time it\u2019s out there. The one time I don\u2019t it\u2019s get stolen and I do feel a bit upset especially since I know how it feels to have stuff stolen.", "created_utc": 1680129003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1262x7e/aita_for_letting_the_neighbor_kids_bike_get/", "score": 422, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If neighbor's kids can't put their bikes in the garage, then their bikes are gonna get stolen. It would've been stolen if neighbor's kid had left it on their own front lawn, too.

I\u2019d say, \u201cplease call the cops so I can press charges of trespassing and littering against your kids.\u201d  Then go ask your neighbor for as much video as they have of them coming into your yard and leaving stuff.  You really need your own security camera though.  I wouldn\u2019t trust these people not to vandalize your property also it would help in the future if one of them gets injured on your property.

That mom has some audacity to blame you when it is her not making her kid take responsibility. She is doing her kid no favors with her entitlement. I\u2019d like her try to explain to the police how it is your fault her kid left something in your yard abs someone else stole it. I have neighbors that leave things laying around in the street or in my driveway. If there stuff gets lost or run over it is on them. At least the parents don\u2019t blame us.", "NTA and not wrong on any counts- financial, moral or physically. None of this is your doing or your responsibility. If you have a fence how are the kids getting in your yard to leave things there? I\u2019m assuming they go onto your property without permission which could put you liable if they were to get injured on your property so I would definitely put a No Trespassing sign up.

Let her do it and keep the footage of the kid abandoning the bike and the guy stealing it.  You might want to put a No Trespassing sign in your yard to make it crystal clear that neither the kids nor their toys are allowed there.  Then toss whatever you find.", "NTA- that\u2019s her fault- not yours, not your problem", "NTA. It's also possible that the pickup truck is not the AH. Was the bike on or near the curb? Where I live, that's an offer to take it away for free most of the time, similar to a chair or empty flower pots put out on the curb. I'm always very cautious when it comes to bikes, because sometimes it is just a kid being careless, but it's extremely possible that pickup guy thought he was reading the situation accurately.", "NTA. She's delusional if she thinks she has a legal leg to stand on", "Legally and morally NTA. Not your kids, not your toys. You have 0 responsibility here. I would build a fence to keep people off if you\u2019re able to.", "If they left the bike in your yard not only without permission but also after you had specifically told them not to, I'd think that legally you're in the clear\n\nAlso, there is video footage of someone stealing it\n\nYou're not responsible for anything someone else leaves on your property while trespassing", "NTA.

Moreover they have been creating a nuisance for you with their littering.\n\nLet her waste her money attempting to take legal action.  She should be used to wasting her money by now anyway.\n\nBut do ask your across-the-street neighbor to save the footage if it's not too late.  You'll need it for when your lazy neighbor tries to call the police.", "You don\u2019t need to replace a bike that someone else stole\u2026HOWEVER if you intentionally run their shit over with your car, you could be held liable for destruction of property. I would avoid that and just either throw it into their yard or at least push it into the side of the street off your land.
