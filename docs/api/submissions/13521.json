{"id": 13521, "submission_id": "1262x7e", "title": "AITA for letting the neighbor kid\u2019s bike get stolen and not replacing it", "selftext": "My neighbors kids keep leaving things in our front yard. They leave toys, balls, frisbees, bikes and even one of those electric cars. It\u2019s a huge problem for us because we can never just leave the driveway without checking to see if it\u2019s clear and our lawn guy won\u2019t cut out grass if it is littered with stuff.\n\nWe have talked to their mother about the issue but nothing ever changed. We then resorted to harshly throwing their stuff in their own yard and also running their stuff over in our driveway. Of course some of their things got damaged and their mom would come yelling at us but we would just tell her if you keep their stuff out our yard this wouldn\u2019t happen. \n\nOne day I was leaving for an appointment and I saw one of their bikes in our yard. I was running late so I said I would deal with  it later. When I got back the bike was gone, I just assumed the mom had come get it. A couple minutes after the school bus passes the mom comes banging at my door asking for the bike. I told her it was gone by the time I got home. She didn\u2019t believe me and told me to have the bike back by tomorrow afternoon so she would call the police. I asked my husband if he knew anything and he said the same thing, it was there when he left and gone when he came back. While I don\u2019t have a security camera the neighbor across the street has one that catches half way into my yard. When I asked her to see the footage you could see a truck drive up to my yard a man get out and put the bike in his truck then drive off. When I got the mom to show her I thought she would apologize for accusing me and use this as a lesson for her kids. Instead she blamed me for leaving it out there and not moving it. She said if I don\u2019t replace the bike she will take legal action. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in the clear legally but maybe morally I\u2019m in the wrong. It\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault their mom refuses to teach them any better and I do move the bike every other time it\u2019s out there. The one time I don\u2019t it\u2019s get stolen and I do feel a bit upset especially since I know how it feels to have stuff stolen.\n\nEdit: with the running over of their stuff over, we didn\u2019t go out of our way to run stuff over. If it wasn\u2019t noticeable or big enough to see out the rearview mirrors we didn\u2019t bother checking. Most of the time when we left in the morning we had to get on all fours and look under the car to see if anything was there.", "created_utc": 1680129003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1262x7e/aita_for_letting_the_neighbor_kids_bike_get/", "score": 831, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No judge would take it seriously, especially with the neighbor\u2019s footage. \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty, don\u2019t apologize. If she accosts you again, tell her than since she\u2019s threatened you over her own reckless behavior and that of her children, any further communication will only happen via your lawyer.", "NTA. The kid has learned a valuable lesson. Good work OP. Get a Ring camera to shoo away any other legal liability in the future.", "NTA morally and legally you are in the right. If I talked to my neighbours and they continued, I would start picking up anything left in my yard and donate it to Goodwill or some sort of charity.", "NTA", "NTA. When I was a kid, I used to play in my aunt's yard and had a bad habit of leaving stuff all over. I was scolded once or twice for leaving stuff where it didn't belong, and I've learned to put back everything I played with. It's not that hard to teach her kids to gather their toys when they're done playing. She's just lazy and likes to play the victim instead of doing something to prevent stuff like this. Don't feel too bad, one way or another they had to learn that leaving their stuff everywhere might get them stolen.", "Absolutely NTA. These neighbors sound terrible!  The nerve of her threatening legal action\u2026 she has nothing to stand on here.", "NTA... Also, the are quite a few low cost camera options. This, and if a fence is out of budget, obvious \"Private property\" or \"No trespassing\" signs would be useful in case of escalation.", "NTA\n\nOffer to call the police for her.", "NTA. They are out of bounds, and their mother is not doing a thing about it. Could you put a low fence around your front lawn as a deterrent to leaving things there? Maybe a small \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign on the driveway.", "NTA. The only thing OP should be saying to that neighbor is to tell them to stop trespassing.", "I am not a lawyer, I am pretty sure that with the security cam from the neighbor, you are in the clear.", "Shoot, I'd wrangle all their toys in the yard and have a trash bin filled weekly. Bike included.", "They'll learn real quick not to leave their stuff on someone else's property.", " They'll learn real quick not to leave their stuff on someone else's property.", "Heck even get recordings of the many other dates/times they have littered your yard with their toys, etc.", "And get your own too! You'll need proof if they resort to physical damage", "THIS NTA", "Happy cake day!", "THIS NTA", "Lol yes I want to see the cops faces. There should be a way to press charges for being a menace to society. Too many crazy people like that mom running around driving good people up the wall.", "Once the kids leave anything on the neighbors property and then walk away, it would be considered abandoned and now belongs to the homeowner. If I was the H.O. I would take the toys in the house every time they were left on my yard and NEVER give them back. They'll learn real quick not to leave their stuff on someone else's property.", "My thoughts as well. How would it have mattered if the bike was in OP\u2019s yard or the neighbor\u2019s yard? I don\u2019t understand how the neighbor can think the bike would\u2019ve been safe from theft in their yard\u2026", "I think it's more that entitled people have gotten really good at making kind people doubt their own sanity.", "It's been abandoned on their property. They're not going to get sued for a basketball.", "And let them know that if any of the kids' crap hurts the car as it gets run over, OP will sue them. Tires are expensive.", "Got ahead of what, the cops are not going to arrest someone because the neighbors bike was taken from their yard.\n\nCan you even imagine that conversation with the cops.", "A sign in the yard saying free toys, please take.", "If you abandon your property on someone else's property, it's not property damage. It's abandoned trash.", "Thank you!", "This- so many people are delusional day to day even I have to ask for a sanity check here and there.", "I want to see the cops faces.", "The future harassment case OP is building against neighbour", " I would take the toys in the house every time they were left on my yard and NEVER give them back.", "[removed]", "u/OverallTemperatur is a bot; this comment is stolen from the post and all of their comments have been made within the past ten minutes.
