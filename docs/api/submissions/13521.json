{"id": 13521, "submission_id": "1262x7e", "title": "AITA for letting the neighbor kid\u2019s bike get stolen and not replacing it", "selftext": "My neighbors kids keep leaving things in our front yard. They leave toys, balls, frisbees, bikes and even one of those electric cars. It\u2019s a huge problem for us because we can never just leave the driveway without checking to see if it\u2019s clear and our lawn guy won\u2019t cut out grass if it is littered with stuff.\n\nWe have talked to their mother about the issue but nothing ever changed. We then resorted to harshly throwing their stuff in their own yard and also running their stuff over in our driveway. Of course some of their things got damaged and their mom would come yelling at us but we would just tell her if you keep their stuff out our yard this wouldn\u2019t happen. \n\nOne day I was leaving for an appointment and I saw one of their bikes in our yard. I was running late so I said I would deal with  it later. When I got back the bike was gone, I just assumed the mom had come get it. A couple minutes after the school bus passes the mom comes banging at my door asking for the bike. I told her it was gone by the time I got home. She didn\u2019t believe me and told me to have the bike back by tomorrow afternoon so she would call the police. I asked my husband if he knew anything and he said the same thing, it was there when he left and gone when he came back. While I don\u2019t have a security camera the neighbor across the street has one that catches half way into my yard. When I asked her to see the footage you could see a truck drive up to my yard a man get out and put the bike in his truck then drive off. When I got the mom to show her I thought she would apologize for accusing me and use this as a lesson for her kids. Instead she blamed me for leaving it out there and not moving it. She said if I don\u2019t replace the bike she will take legal action. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in the clear legally but maybe morally I\u2019m in the wrong. It\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault their mom refuses to teach them any better and I do move the bike every other time it\u2019s out there. The one time I don\u2019t it\u2019s get stolen and I do feel a bit upset especially since I know how it feels to have stuff stolen.\n\nEdit: with the running over of their stuff over, we didn\u2019t go out of our way to run stuff over. If it wasn\u2019t noticeable or big enough to see out the rearview mirrors we didn\u2019t bother checking. Most of the time when we left in the morning we had to get on all fours and look under the car to see if anything was there.", "created_utc": 1680129003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1262x7e/aita_for_letting_the_neighbor_kids_bike_get/", "score": 1202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was a kid, I used to play in my aunt's yard and had a bad habit of leaving stuff all over. I was scolded once or twice for leaving stuff where it didn't belong, and I've learned to put back everything I played with. It's not that hard to teach her kids to gather their toys when they're done playing. She's just lazy and likes to play the victim instead of doing something to prevent stuff like this. Don't feel too bad, one way or another they had to learn that leaving their stuff everywhere might get them stolen.", "Absolutely NTA. These neighbors sound terrible!  The nerve of her threatening legal action\u2026 she has nothing to stand on here.", "NTA... Also, the are quite a few low cost camera options.

Years ago an old neighbor of mine parked his truck several inches in front of my garage and left me trapped between his truck and a large tree to get out and didn\u2019t answer his door to move it. I had to get out for work and try as I might to shoot the incredibly small gap, I clipped his taillight. I took a photo of how far into my property he was, and my insurance said I was not at fault because he left his truck unoccupied on my property and blocked my access. So even if you destroyed property of theirs by accident, legally if it\u2019s placed on your property without your permission or knowledge it\u2019s not your problem. And it\u2019s sure not your problem if someone stole abandoned property from your yard.", "NTA - but can\u2019t think what would happen if the kid played in your yard and got injured or something else happened to them.

Of course you would never mean for their toys to get taken, but if they just so happen to be on your property and someone else happens to take them thinking they are a part of the \u201cfree\u201d stuff because they are in your lawn/driveway\u2026. well that is just unfortunate and totally unexpected", "NTA.

If the kids are old enough to play outside unsupervised, then they are old enough to to learn the consequences of their actions. The fact they have already been suffering those consequences without changing their behaviour says it\u2019s not going to change. OP, it\u2019s time to start hitting them where it hurts. Put up no trespassing/no littering signage. Then every toy that gets left, gets taken. Don\u2019t give them back. Donate or garbage. Once it becomes very costly to replace, Mum might actually parent. Or the kids will start doing it themselves. You will probably end up in court; cause anyone can sue anyone but as long as you have protected yourself with signage & warnings, you should be clear.

Of course NTA. \n\nGet a camera. Keep running over their stuff.*\n\nAlso, people learn lessons all kinds of ways, and natural consequences are one of the best.

They hafta learn some way, and mom sure isn\u2019t teaching em.\n\n*I don\u2019t mean that, exactly. You sure are well within your rights to keep doing it.

How is it your responsibility to keep track of your neighbor's kid's things? \n\nAlso, I cab relate we have 8 kid's total living across the street from us and we find stuff in our front yard all the time.

Buzz off lady and keep your kids in your own yard.   \n\n\nbtw, I am a nice neighbor and can tolerate a lot myself, but start accusing me of stuff over your negligence and I sing a different tune.

Admittedly, one could argue that the mom couldn't have anticipated the theft either, but the bike was only in a position to be stolen because she ignored OP's repeated request to keep it out of the driveway.", "NTA.
