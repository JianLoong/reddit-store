Unless an actual doctor has diagnosed you with this, no you don\u2019t.", "As someone with a light form of misophonia, it is really hard to be near someone who is making slurping sounds while eating. Eating sounds in general will make me uncomfortable but slurping is just another level.\n\nI know it sounds funny but I literally cannot stand it. Sometimes it's bearable but sometimes it is not. My partner doesn't really understand this but she usually tries to be considerate (we talked about it).\n\nWhen she is not, I usually just leave the room to escape.\n\nSo *if* (and only if) OP's partner is suffering from this as well, I understand why his comment happened. This exact thought is going through my mind every time someone does it (usually in an even less nice way). It disgusts me and I can't understand why someone would eat like that in that moment. It does make you go from 0 to 100 quickly and it's not necessarily something you can easily control.\n\nHowever, if you are suffering from this, you need to learn to deal with it since it's *your* problem, not the problem of people around you. Talk to your partner, explain the situation and then find a solution that both of you will be able to live with. She can try to reduce it, he can try to leave to prevent an escalation.\n\nIf OP's partner isn't suffering from this, he's just an asshole.\n\nEither way, OP is NTA.", "Kinda like people who chew gum with their mouth open.", "You can walk away", "[removed]", "r/whoosh", "Hey now even the rind doesn't deserve that", "Right?
