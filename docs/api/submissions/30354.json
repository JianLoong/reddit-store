But like... he's the dumbass that cut the watermelon so big. You could have gone and cut it smaller if you were having issues, but if I was eating something and someone made that kind of comment to me, I would have pulled my Queen of Petty out. I would have made firm eye contact and then slurped it like I was trying to win a suck-prize. Loudly. \n\nIf he can't ask you to eat more quietly politely, then he needs some frigging lessons in manners. Or just to voice it at all beyond that kind of insult.

Your boyfriend could have said you're eating quite loudly and it's hard to concentrate on the show because he's concentrating on the sound you're making as you're eating the watermelon. He could have also skipped all that and just paused the show, cut up the watermelon, then come back with toothpicks or forks and a handful of napkins. The way it was done may come across condescending, especially since he was the one who cut the watermelon into thick slices in the first place.\n\nAs for yourself... manners don't stop just because you're going out with each other. If you know you're going to eat a messy or noise-creating food (monkey peanuts, pork crackling, pomegranate, etc.), or you know your boyfriend didn't present the food in a more 'romantic' way (giant watermelon slices you can't even get your jaw around), take steps to be polite about how you eat the food or make a kind suggestion to change how it's served.\n\nLet's face it: Watermelon is loud and messy to consume.
