She is not even far along enough to go to the doctor yet. \n\nMy BIL asked his brother, my husband, my brother to help him move their bed and bedroom furniture downstairs to what used to be the dining room. I didn't understand the reason behind it but my sister says she has to avoid stairs during the pregnancy. She has also decided to stay in bed except for trips to the bathroom because she doesn't want anything to happen and bedrest is safer. I asked what she will do about going to the doctor and she says my BIL will carry to the car even though there are no stairs on the way and carry her inside the clinic too. She said she won't leave the house except to go to the doctor.\n\nI want to clarify that my sister has never been pregnant before and has no health conditions or issues. She has not even been to the doctor yet and isn't undergoing bedrest at the doctors advice. For context I have been pregnant 3 times and I know sometimes it can be risky and every woman is different.

No one is going for this and some of the comments to them have been harsh. I tried to be sensitive and told my sister I understand it's scary being pregnant especially the first time. But I feel like it's an overreaction. She just doubled down. Am I crazy for thinking this is too much?

On top of being insanely entitled and downright cruel to her partner, that's not healthy.", "NTA - anything else?  Did she ask for a bell so she can summon her minions to bring her food?   Assuming she isn't being lazy, your sister probably needs help from a mental health professional.  If she is healthy, then she can go about her business as normal for pretty much the entire pregnancy.  Hell, in some places in the world women give birth in the field then go back to work almost straight away - and somehow they survive.  \n\nI want to say this is the single most entitled nonsense I have yet seen on this sub, but maybe she really does have some psych problem.", "NTA - So your sister could potentially risk getting bed sores and poor circulation because of 1 missed period and she doesn't even have a positive pregnancy test yet?\nDid I read this right?\n\nPeriods get missed all the time. Lots of things can cause missed or late periods. She's not necessarily pregnant. If after 2 weeks, she's still testing negative, this is super fucking weird.", "Umm this is weird\u2026 NTA\u2026 9 months is a LONG time for not getting out of the bed for no valid reason\u2026 especially given light exercise is important during pregnancy\u2026 also how would she not go stir crazy\u2026 good luck OP.", "NO. NTA. Pregnancy can be difficult, but unless it\u2019s doctor ordered bed rest, no one should have to wait hand and foot on her. Or carry her. She\u2019s not even that far into the pregnancy to go to the doctor? It sounds she wants to be pampered. She sure jumped on that opportunity because she immediately stated she was pregnant, not even far enough along to be positive on pregnancy tests or go to the doctor.   \n\n\nShe\u2019s TA, not you.", "NTA, going on bedrest while you're pregnant without needing to is actually pretty dangerous. You need to stay active while you're pregnant.

Maybe stop answering your phone every time she calls..", "NTA\n\n>If my sister was actually on medically ordered bedrest or it was a high risk pregnancy I would feel differently of course. But under these circumstances I feel like this is too much.\n\nYou are absolutely right, sister IS overreacting. This level of \"resting\"/inactivity without doctor's orders will be detrimental to your sister and the baby's health later during her pregnancy. She is pregnant, not sick/ill.\n\n>I want to clarify that my sister has never been pregnant before\n\nMaybe someone close to her had a bad miscarriage in the early stages of pregnancy and that scared her.\n\nI hope she finds a good doctor that will reasure her that moderate activity is good and necessary for mom and baby.", "RANDOM QUESTION- is this your blood sister and she is married to your husband's brother?", "NAH. It\u2019s definitely weird, but if that makes her comfortable until she gets to her Obgyn visit, whatever. However, that does not mean you personally have to cater to her. If her husband wants to, fine. But that\u2019s not your responsibility. \n\nAlso, it is entirely possible that she had a miscarriage before or just heard lots of stories and is trying to be overly cautious. Still weird, but still not your problem.", "Info: Do you know if she has had miscarriages in the past? Her extreme caution while over the top, points to her having lost a pregnancy before. \n\nAbsent that I\u2019m going to go with NTA- \nAn easy fix for this is don\u2019t help, let her and her husband figure out how to live with her fears. Hopefully her doctor sets her straight, or provides help for her anxiety.  Otherwise her husband is going to be in for a long 40 weeks.", "NTA, this is a huge case of weaponised incompetence", "NAH\nYou are not wrong, but I can\u2019t call your sister an AH for feeling stress.", "Has your sister had any miscarriages before this pregnancy? I'm not trying to make assumptions here but if she has maybe she is terrified to lose this one and thinks bedrest will keep the baby to term. If not then she needs to see a doctor asap to see if her being on voluntary bedrest is safe for her and the baby. I think she needs to keep her regular life going to keep everything energized or she risks being too weak to deliver. Doctors usually encourage regular activities if possible I think. NTA but she needs an indepth conversation with someone about her choices and how it could effect the pregnancy.", "NAH. But I hope your sister listens when the doctor tells her she can continue normal activities through her pregnancy! I worked (childcare) up until days before each of my three children were born, including picking up kids to change diapers at 9 months pregnant. The day before my youngest was born, I was walking around our county fair in 80 degrees and high humidity. (Honestly, I was trying to go into labor ahead of my c section date, but that didn't happen.) The only time I was told to take it easy and rest while pregnant was the end of my first pregnancy. We got in a bad car accident one evening and I had to spend 6 hours at the hospital being monitored to ensure everything was okay with me and baby. I begged to go home and sleep in my own bed but was only allowed to leave with strict orders to rest and return at the first sign I might be in labor (I was back in the hospital less than 24 hours after they let me leave that night).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she has no past history of miscarriages or medical issues she's being ridiculous. No matter the circumstances she doesn't get to make demands of people's time.

I had a slight placenta previa with my 4th pregnancy and still worked a 40 hr week, so I'm really confused right now. They're going too far, and they'll realize it soon enough.

This is truly odd and misguided behavior.  I would try to find out the roots of why this strategy was decided on.  \n\nI'm gonna be honest, this sounds a lot like an idea cooked up by an overly protective conservative husband.  It could be a lot of other things, from she's hiding medical info to depression to a drug problem and everything in between.  But, it definitely would trigger more concern in me than irritation.

They have to confirm everything with ultrasound. With the sensitivity of pregnancy tests these days, someone could have a positive pregnancy test for a few days before it goes away. It's called a chemical pregnancy.\n\nShe needs to go to the doctor and get everything checked out. She needs to ask the doctor for their advice on activity levels and things to do and not do.

That would be a jerk move on my part.\n\nShe only got married and stopped her birth control earlier this year. I know about the birth control because she asked me my experience about stopping since we were on the same kind. She also told me this is her first pregnancy.", "Weird. I can only guess that the reason she's acting this way is because it is her first pregnancy. \n\nSome women (and possibly the husband too) get super bonkers/helicopter style/paranoid with their first pregnancy/first child. \n\nCome the second child, the nerves calm down and they become more relaxed after realizing they didn't need to be on edge so much.", "I remember that feeling the first time I was pregnant so that's why I tried to be sensitive when I told her this is too much.
