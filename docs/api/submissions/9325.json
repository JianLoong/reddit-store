When it was time to pay the check, she made excuses and tried to pin the bill on her other friend. I\u2019d already paid my check, which was about \u2153 what she ordered because she also wanted to take food home. It was a $$ to $$$ restaurant. Her other friend refused to pay and I left very quickly. Now I\u2019m getting lots of calls from her and telling me things that sound depressing.  English is my second language. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI( f32) have a friend, Liah ( f32) who I've known since I was 12. We drifted apart because she doesn't support my career ambitions and had a tendency to pull me to the fun and leisure lifestyle and that came in conflict with my need to focus on my goals.  I'm on a very strict budget . I\u2019m also planning on celebrating passing my qualification exam by not working for two months this summer until I get integrated into the job offer waiting for me. \n\nAfter 7 years apart, she invited me to lunch with another friend of hers. I finished my post graduate, created a startup, have accomplishments that I\u2019m proud of and she isn\u2019t interested. We can never talk about anything but her. She insisted, and I gave in because her husband just dumped her and I thought maybe I could make a difference at least for a few hours. \n\nHer other friend, Elizabeth (f32) arrived, and we started ordering food. Elizabeth is extremely wealthy. I\u2019ve known her since we were teenagers. Her own friendship with Liah kind of died years ago but I\u2019ve always suspected it\u2019s because Liah doesn\u2019t reciprocate. \n\nOne hour into our lunch date, I noticed Elizabeth\u2019s face changed when Liah started ordering like crazy. I really wanted one of those huge crabs (like the mugbangs), so I specifically ordered one to avoid past situations where Liah suddenly wants everyone to share their food.  Because Elizabeth\u2019s demeanor was a red flag, I asked for a separate check to send the message that I'm not an opportunist. No one flinched so it was all good. I paid for my food via cash app and whatever else I ordered was from drinks and dessert. \n\nLiah starts dragging, she ate a lot and called her family that she was carrying a doggy bag. Ok cool. But then she did a \u201cI forgot my wallet\u201d skit which was especially infuriating. Elizabeth looked unimpressed and said \u201cuse your cash app then\u201d. Liah then came up with a sob story, ran her ATM and it was declined.  Elizabeth called the waitress and asked for a detailed separation of the bill items, then paid for her own food while I was perplexed and fucking speechless. Elizabeth called Liah a leech.  I was so embarrassed I went out of the restaurant and called Uber. \n\nI feel horrible because I walked out and hid from her the whole time while waiting for my ride. I don\u2019t know what happened next. I\u2019m getting daily voice messages from Liah crying  and accusing me of lurching her. I know I did the right thing by choosing myself but I\u2019m feeling down.

She knew she didn\u2019t have any money before she went to the restaurant.", "NTA and Elizabeth is right that she is a leech. If Liah wants to order expensive food then she can pay for it. She should be paying for her portion of the bill anyways. The only person who should be embarrassed is Liah. I don\u2019t know where you are from but here in the U.S. unless someone offers to pay for your meal most people who go out for for a meal with friends split the bill and pay for what they ordered.", "NTA\nGood thing you took off.

I experienced this several times with a relative of my ex husband. She made more money than most of us, but had a reputation throughout the family of pinning the bill for herself on others.

You and Elizabeth recognized the scam and refused to be played. Good job getting away from your grifter, um friend.", "NTA I hate people who are self-centered and try to take advantage of others. If I know someone is having financial difficulties, I ask them to lunch and expect to pay. If I am short on funds and someone invites me. I make sure I can afford to go and only order what I can easily afford. Sometimes someone offers to buy my food. I don't like to accept. I can buy my own food.

Liah clearly had no intention of paying for her share of the meal, and it sounds like this is a recurring theme by the way Elizabeth reacted.

You aren't responsible for her. Block her number and be done with this \"friend\".", "NTA\n\nSounds like Liah planned this whole thing out to get a free lunch for herself and her family(taking doggy bag home).  Glad Elizabeth called her out.\n\nI\u2019m of the mindset of if I invite someone to lunch, I\u2019m paying.  Just how I am.", "NTA. But she was planning this. It is quite obvious she was going to try and use you or Elizabeth to eat well. Good for you both.", "NTA  You need to let her go.  Meaning no contact.", "NTA- she is a leech & maybe you need to tell her & clarify the status of your relationship. She will continue to be a  bad friend as long as its allowed & will claim plausible deniability if no one calls her out on it.", "NTA. She invited both of you. If she couldn\u2019t pay for everything or even herself, she shouldn\u2019t have gone out. Both of you invited parties did your part paying your intake. Your friend, on the other hand, should learn that when you invite people, expect to pay for all, some, or your own meal unless otherwise discussed.", "I guess Elizabeth has had enough experiences where Liah didn\u2019t pay when both of them went out/had food outside. That\u2019s why she called Liah a leech to her face and refused to pay for Liah\u2019s share.\n\nYou are NTA but I wish you had told Liah that her behavior was unacceptable before you walked out", "NTA it\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for others meals. And who goes out to eat with out a way to pay for the meal", "NTA. Liah planned to stick you with her bill and you cleverly avoided it. That is not the same as leaving Liah in the lurch. She should not have tried to cheat you or treated her family at your expense.", "NTA and Liah is a leech and has a history of outrageous leeching activity\n\nI am curious as to how both you and Elizabeth managed to get away with not paying because as far as the restaurant is concerned, people who eat together are jointly liable for the bill especially since the requests for special checks didn't come up until AFTER a lot of stuff had been ordered.\n\nDid Liah eventually pay with a credit card? Was she detained for theft of the food?", "NTA.  It\u2019s funny.  I wonder what happened es with Leah. Did she pay or wash dishes?  Lol", "NTA keep a distance from my person she is not your friend. She is an opportunist and I would message the other friend letting her know that you had nothing to do with that bullshit and you\u2019re sorry that she had to deal with that.", "NTA.  People like this need to face the consequences.  You did the right thing, don't worry about it.", "I mean Liah ordered take home food. And you guys didn\u2019t pay for it. \n\nUh oh Liah", "Liah sure sounds like a wonderful friend *rolling eyes*", "I think her habit of using people may be one reason she is divorced. I would not care to be married to a person who behaves like Liah does.", "Unbelievable that people of continue to validate that kind of behavior.", "Liah hit the \"find out\" portion of the game and was not prepared.", "IDK about joint liability but in my case, I had expressed \"separate checks\" very early on during lunch when Elizabeth began to look annoyed. Honestly, I did it so that Elizabeth saw that I wasn't trying to pull any weird move. At least in my experience, unless you say its a joint bill, no one is forced to pay. \n\nWhat I find mortifying is how much food she ordered, and she did it very confidently. Whenever I go out, I wanna make sure I can pay, even if someone is treating me. I don't know how she settled the bill, but her intention was abusive.", "I don't know. I got out as soon as I could.", "It was clear to me that you were NTA nor was Elizabeth so I wanted to offer that judgment clearly instead of using info.\n\nI was (and am) genuinely curious about how it ended. Did the restaurant let Liah leave - did she wind up finding money miraculously. \n\nIn this day of instant communication her family could send her money or even give the restaurant their credit card information because technically a restaurant can prevent a guest from leaving until they get payment - especially in this situation where it appears that there was an expensive bill that needed to be paid by Liah for her share of the food", "I mean, I feel terrible for Elizabeth getting stuck dealing with Liah alone. Thats the only place there's any hint if your wrong doing - it would have been far better if you had paid, encouraged Elizabeth to pay (for herself) and then grasped Elizabeth's arm in a friendly way and said \"Liah, we'll just be outside while you look for your wallet\" and pulled her out with you.\n\nBut in no way shape or form should you feel any guilt about leaving Liah.\n\nNTA", "NTA Forget Liah. If you like Elizabeth as a friend invite her out to lunch just you 2.", "NTA. But if you go out to eat again. Make a joke about did you bring your card. A friendly reminder you're not playing games.", "NTA, she did that on purpose. Everyone at the table knew what Liah was up to. She has no one to blame but herself. Go no contact with her. Elisabeth was right she's a leech and will never be a true friend.", "Liah is an AH and not your friend lol\n\nNTA", "Honestly you don't. Simply because a true friend wouldn't have done that. Distance yourself from this person who is not your friend but simply believes you are a free ATM. \n\nShe DELIBERATELY planned to have the both of you/or one of you buy her lunch AND her family.\n\nNot your fault. Not your monkeys. Not your circus.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I would suggest instead that you and Elizabeth grab a drink and commiserate.", "This is stuff my cousin would do to me when she was in college. But I would invite her out knowing I would pay for her and she would order extra food to take home.", "She does have history of \"finding her wallet\" miraculously. I went home after that and saw no activity in her profile. She deleted her check-in to that restaurant. I did see Elizabeth posted a quote in instagram about people who stay in your life only because they are loyal to their own needs, but don't know what else happened.", "NTA. But I really want to know what happened after OP left.", "INFO~ If this has happened on many occasions before, then I can see where you would say enough. If this happened out of the blue you should have covered her.", "Honestly, it's no big wonder Liah's husband dumped her if she's a 32 year old party girl with no ability to make conversation on topics that don't specifically pertain to her.\n\nAs for what to do to stop feeling guilty? Focus on the feeling of being used, about how she really only invited you and a wealthy friend out for the cash coverage at a nice restaurant, about how she's looking to other sources now that the gravy train is running dry.\n\nThis might seem counter intuitive, but being mad and focusing on that often helps supercede guilt. It's how I learned to erect boundaries against people who were less friend and more frenemy. I focused on what they did and remembered that it was for the best to keep them away. Eventually, in time, the anger fades, but the guilt won't return, because such guilt is entirely momentary in its nature.\n\nNTA", "Why are you feeling down? I can see being pissed at Liah, but not down on yourself. She tried to stiff you with the lunch tab, but her attempt failed.  This is all on her. She reaped what she sowed, and she deserved it.", "If any of my \u201cfriends\u201d did the wallet thing they wouldn\u2019t be my friend any longer. My friends know they can ask and if I can\u2019t we can have some ramen.", "She's harassing you. Block her. NTA", "Elizabeth had probably already had a talk with Liah about the exact behavior.", "NT and do not meet up with Liah ever again. Elizabeth knew this was coming and probably the reason why they weren't friends for a long time.", "NTA. She hasn't seen you for 7 years and after this she's hitting you up everyday to bitch you out? Just block her, she sounds like a real leech and not someone you need in your life.", "NTA. Girl\u2019s been learning from Anna Delvey. Don\u2019t bother.", "Also sounds like Elizabeth has been on this ride before.", "Seriously. No wonder her marriage failed. Someone like this, who is completely incapable of empathy, could absolutely not sustain a healthy relationship long-term.\n\nOP, you didn\u2019t do anything except pay for what you ordered. You are NTA in any way. You do not owe Liah anything, no matter how much she thinks she deserves.  Her \u201cfriendship\u201d isn\u2019t worth any of this, particularly as she isn\u2019t much of a friend.", "NTA - the  other posters have already given good advice. It\u2019s obvious that Leah fully expected you and Elizabeth to cover the bill.  If she\u2019d been honest and said \u201cI\u2019d love to meet you for lunch but I\u2019m broke right now, are you able to pay for me?\u201d Then you\u2019d be prepared - though it sounds like she was ordering extra to take home, which is a whole other very cheeky thing. If she\u2019s still texting you about leaving her there, I\u2019d text back ONCE only, then block her.  I\u2019d say \u201cYou knew you couldn\u2019t pay your bill but expected Elizabeth and I to pay it without asking us first. That\u2019s incredibly rude. I clearly said \u2018seperate bills\u2019 and you said nothing. It\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve tried to do this, but it\u2019s the last time you try it with me.\u201d", "NTA. Block Liah, make some good friends!", "Elizabeth called her a leech for a reason. NTA. Liah knew exactly what she was doing with this scam.", "NTA. Just block her and forget about her. Elizabeth was right about her being a leech.  Liah tried to ambush her 2 \"closest friends\" into paying for her very expensive meal. 2 friends who truly knew her for what she is. A mooch.", "TYPICALLY when a friend invites you, it is done with the intent that the FRIEND is paying. Ofc, no one has any respect or courtesy anymore, and your friend is just a mooch. She absolutely only invited Elizabeth with the intent that she would pay. \nLiah is a toxic friend, and you both need to cut her off.\n\nNTA.", "Seems like Elizabeth knew exactly what will happen when she started to order like crazy. She planned this from the beginning. Thousands of people get divorced daily, this doesn't give her a right to mooch of others. If you have no money, don't go in expensive restaurants and especially don't use your friends to feed your family with expensive food!\n\nNTA Why do you feel bad? Your \"friend\" alone put themself in this position. And do you not realize that she  just message you like this to guilt-trip snd manipulate you to send you money? She is no friend.", "Bot if given the chance, most likely.", "I have never heard of, if your friend invites you out they are paying. I've never expected a friend to pay for me because they invited me to hang out. Only shitty people who are users expect others to pay for them.", "Why? OP didn't order the food, nor did they eat the food. Its not OP responsibility to pay for someone else's meal.", "Many wealthy people have been.  My mom has money, and a certain cousin of hers will go out with her and never offer to pay.  Ever.  I wish my mom would say \"separate checks\" when they sit down, but she doesn't.", "I remember reading a post a while back about a woman (I think) whose boyfriend pulled this leaving the wallet at home all the time; so she took his wallet in her purse with them to the restaurant.  It came time to pay, he said he forgot his wallet--and told her the ubiquitous \"I'll get it next time,\" which never comes--and she pulled it out and said something like I grabbed it for you.  \n\nHe had the nerve to get mad at her.\n\nAnd who really leaves one's wallet at home so often?   In the past 20 years, I have forgotten my wallet twice."]}
