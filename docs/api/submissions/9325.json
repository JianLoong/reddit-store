When it was time to pay the check, she made excuses and tried to pin the bill on her other friend. I\u2019d already paid my check, which was about \u2153 what she ordered because she also wanted to take food home. It was a $$ to $$$ restaurant. Her other friend refused to pay and I left very quickly. Now I\u2019m getting lots of calls from her and telling me things that sound depressing.  English is my second language. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI( f32) have a friend, Liah ( f32) who I've known since I was 12. We drifted apart because she doesn't support my career ambitions and had a tendency to pull me to the fun and leisure lifestyle and that came in conflict with my need to focus on my goals.  I'm on a very strict budget . I\u2019m also planning on celebrating passing my qualification exam by not working for two months this summer until I get integrated into the job offer waiting for me. \n\nAfter 7 years apart, she invited me to lunch with another friend of hers. I finished my post graduate, created a startup, have accomplishments that I\u2019m proud of and she isn\u2019t interested. We can never talk about anything but her. She insisted, and I gave in because her husband just dumped her and I thought maybe I could make a difference at least for a few hours. \n\nHer other friend, Elizabeth (f32) arrived, and we started ordering food. Elizabeth is extremely wealthy. I\u2019ve known her since we were teenagers. Her own friendship with Liah kind of died years ago but I\u2019ve always suspected it\u2019s because Liah doesn\u2019t reciprocate. \n\nOne hour into our lunch date, I noticed Elizabeth\u2019s face changed when Liah started ordering like crazy. I really wanted one of those huge crabs (like the mugbangs), so I specifically ordered one to avoid past situations where Liah suddenly wants everyone to share their food.  Because Elizabeth\u2019s demeanor was a red flag, I asked for a separate check to send the message that I'm not an opportunist. No one flinched so it was all good. I paid for my food via cash app and whatever else I ordered was from drinks and dessert. \n\nLiah starts dragging, she ate a lot and called her family that she was carrying a doggy bag. Ok cool. But then she did a \u201cI forgot my wallet\u201d skit which was especially infuriating. Elizabeth looked unimpressed and said \u201cuse your cash app then\u201d. Liah then came up with a sob story, ran her ATM and it was declined.  Elizabeth called the waitress and asked for a detailed separation of the bill items, then paid for her own food while I was perplexed and fucking speechless. Elizabeth called Liah a leech.  I was so embarrassed I went out of the restaurant and called Uber. \n\nI feel horrible because I walked out and hid from her the whole time while waiting for my ride. I don\u2019t know what happened next. I\u2019m getting daily voice messages from Liah crying  and accusing me of lurching her. I know I did the right thing by choosing myself but I\u2019m feeling down. Any advice on how to get past this?", "created_utc": 1675726469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vlw7o/aita_for_walking_out_of_a_restaurant_to_avoid/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have zero idea if she got in trouble what, but also I have no guarantee that she would wanna pay me back.

You get past this by focusing on the facts. Walking out was a healthy boundary and a clear message. The family she called re: the doggy bag can cover the charge. Her behavior was unacceptable. \n\nIts up to you to continue, curb or stop this friendship.

Why does Liah deserve to have her food covered by you? Why do you over invest in Liah's emotional state, especially when she's made it clear she doesn't care what her actions do in terms of how they impact you?\n\nWhat is Liah actually doing to help build community with you versus what she does at present which is take company with you?\n\nMy advice for how to get past this? Ask yourself if you're comfortable lighting yourself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nNTA.", "As others have said, NTA. You\u2019re grown women. If she couldn\u2019t afford the meal she shouldn\u2019t have chosen that restaurant and ordered what she did. Unless, of course, she did it all on purpose hoping you\u2019d both pay. Either way, she\u2019s (Liah) the AH here.", "NTA. And the advice is to go NC with Liah, block her.  She **IS** a leech.", "NTA.  She knew she didn\u2019t have any money before she went to the restaurant.", "NTA and Elizabeth is right that she is a leech. If Liah wants to order expensive food then she can pay for it. She should be paying for her portion of the bill anyways. The only person who should be embarrassed is Liah. I don\u2019t know where you are from but here in the U.S. unless someone offers to pay for your meal most people who go out for for a meal with friends split the bill and pay for what they ordered.", "NTA\nGood thing you took off. Now you just have to block Liah. No one needs a \"friend\" like that.", "NTA.  She tried to scam you.", "She's not much of a friend, is she? \n\nNTA", "NTA and this Liah not your friend.", "NTA. I experienced this several times with a relative of my ex husband. She made more money than most of us, but had a reputation throughout the family of pinning the bill for herself on others. My ex husband would complain bitterly to me every time, but would pay for her. I stopped going to any meal including her. I was sick of it.", "You're NTA. You and Elizabeth recognized the scam and refused to be played. Good job getting away from your grifter, um friend.", "NTA I hate people who are self-centered and try to take advantage of others. If I know someone is having financial difficulties, I ask them to lunch and expect to pay. If I am short on funds and someone invites me. I make sure I can afford to go and only order what I can easily afford. Sometimes someone offers to buy my food. I don't like to accept. I can buy my own food. If I do accept, I will still order only what I can easily afford.\n\nThis person is not your friend, she is a manipulative user, and you would do best to avoid her in future.", "NTA! Liah clearly had no intention of paying for her share of the meal, and it sounds like this is a recurring theme by the way Elizabeth reacted. It\u2019s normal to feel awkward and sympathetic after that situation, but you did the right thing sticking up for yourself and not letting her use you for a free meal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren't responsible for her. Block her number and be done with this \"friend\".", "NTA\n\nSounds like Liah planned this whole thing out to get a free lunch for herself and her family(taking doggy bag home).  Glad Elizabeth called her out.\n\nI\u2019m of the mindset of if I invite someone to lunch, I\u2019m paying.  Just how I am.", "NTA. But she was planning this. It is quite obvious she was going to try and use you or Elizabeth to eat well. Good for you both.", "NTA  You need to let her go.  Meaning no contact.", "NTA- she is a leech & maybe you need to tell her & clarify the status of your relationship. She will continue to be a  bad friend as long as its allowed & will claim plausible deniability if no one calls her out on it.", "NTA. She invited both of you. If she couldn\u2019t pay for everything or even herself, she shouldn\u2019t have gone out. Both of you invited parties did your part paying your intake. Your friend, on the other hand, should learn that when you invite people, expect to pay for all, some, or your own meal unless otherwise discussed.", "I guess Elizabeth has had enough experiences where Liah didn\u2019t pay when both of them went out/had food outside. That\u2019s why she called Liah a leech to her face and refused to pay for Liah\u2019s share.\n\nYou are NTA but I wish you had told Liah that her behavior was unacceptable before you walked out", "NTA it\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for others meals. And who goes out to eat with out a way to pay for the meal", "NTA. Liah planned to stick you with her bill and you cleverly avoided it. That is not the same as leaving Liah in the lurch. She should not have tried to cheat you or treated her family at your expense.", "NTA and Liah is a leech and has a history of outrageous leeching activity\n\nI am curious as to how both you and Elizabeth managed to get away with not paying because as far as the restaurant is concerned, people who eat together are jointly liable for the bill especially since the requests for special checks didn't come up until AFTER a lot of stuff had been ordered.\n\nDid Liah eventually pay with a credit card? Was she detained for theft of the food?", "NTA.  It\u2019s funny.  I wonder what happened es with Leah. Did she pay or wash dishes?  Lol", "NTA keep a distance from my person she is not your friend. She is an opportunist and I would message the other friend letting her know that you had nothing to do with that bullshit and you\u2019re sorry that she had to deal with that.", "NTA.  People like this need to face the consequences.  You did the right thing, don't worry about it.", "I mean Liah ordered take home food. And you guys didn\u2019t pay for it. \n\nUh oh Liah", "Liah sure sounds like a wonderful friend *rolling eyes*", "I think her habit of using people may be one reason she is divorced. I would not care to be married to a person who behaves like Liah does.", "Unbelievable that people of continue to validate that kind of behavior.", "Liah hit the \"find out\" portion of the game and was not prepared.", "IDK about joint liability but in my case, I had expressed \"separate checks\" very early on during lunch when Elizabeth began to look annoyed. Honestly, I did it so that Elizabeth saw that I wasn't trying to pull any weird move. At least in my experience, unless you say its a joint bill, no one is forced to pay. \n\nWhat I find mortifying is how much food she ordered, and she did it very confidently. Whenever I go out, I wanna make sure I can pay, even if someone is treating me. I don't know how she settled the bill, but her intention was abusive.", "I don't know. I got out as soon as I could.", "It was clear to me that you were NTA nor was Elizabeth so I wanted to offer that judgment clearly instead of using info.\n\nI was (and am) genuinely curious about how it ended. Did the restaurant let Liah leave - did she wind up finding money miraculously. \n\nIn this day of instant communication her family could send her money or even give the restaurant their credit card information because technically a restaurant can prevent a guest from leaving until they get payment - especially in this situation where it appears that there was an expensive bill that needed to be paid by Liah for her share of the food"]}
