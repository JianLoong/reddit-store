Some time ago my wife had mentioned having regrets about never having lived in NYC since that was always her dream. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time until a few months ago when she told me that she wanted to move there temporarily by herself to see if she could \u201cmake it there\u201d (she\u2019s an artist). After a lot of discussion we agreed upon her living there for a year and she said she would plan on coming home once to visit during that time at Christmas. This was a difficult decision for me since I work 60-70 hours a week and we have 2 young kids but I don\u2019t want her to have any regrets or end up resenting me and luckily my parents have been willing to help out a lot. We were able to find her a decent sublet that she moved into about 2 weeks ago. Since she has been gone she has FaceTimed me to see the kids about 3 times. That\u2019s great and all because I want her to see the kids but after every call our son has had a complete meltdown. After the most recent call it took me an hour to calm him down. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy for him and honestly it\u2019s a lot for me to deal with on top of everything else. Recently I told her that I do not want to FaceTime her anymore with the kids for that reason and she was very upset saying it\u2019s not right for me to keep the kids from her etc, I just have to learn how to deal with meltdowns and that eventually they will get used to seeing her on FaceTime. I think she\u2019s being unfair to me so AITA?\n\nEDIT: I should probably mention that this is not the first time she has left for an extended amount of time. When our son was about 6 months old and then again when he was about a year she was gone for 2-3 months visiting her mother who has health issues which I understood at the time. \nI should also mention that early in our relationship and marriage she did sacrifice a lot for my career which is part of the reason I felt like I needed to \u201clet her\u201d do this.", "created_utc": 1685929874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140yanf/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_facetime_our_kids/", "score": 2564, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your children are so young. So so young. I get why your wife felt bad about not making some of her dreams come true, which lots of parents have to come to terms with, but she essentially abandoned her young children when developmentally they needed her the most. And it wasn\u2019t like she was in the military and had no choice, she chose to leave, both them and you and the life you built together. I just, I don\u2019t even know what to say.\n\nI think you need to speak to a child therapist to see what the best path forward should be. This is a traumatic experience for your children. You and them need help. She hasn\u2019t wanted to at least speak with them once a day? Read them a book before bed time (get two books, she keeps one and you keep one)? \n\nThe family law attorney in me wants to warn you, you may be coming to a fork in the road. What happens when your wife hasn\u2019t made it work in one year? Will she want to stay in NYC? Will she want to come home and admit defeat? If she comes home, will she be content with her life? Fulfilled?\n\nMy mom was not meant to be a mother, and she left. My dad had to raise us by himself without much help. We saw our mom occasionally but she lived the life of a single person, not a single mother. You should probably talk to a divorce attorney in your state and just educate yourself on what would happen if your wife decides to not come home. What rights do you have, what rights would she have, what would happen with your kids? \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA because your son is so young, he doesn\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t see his mom in person, and why he\u2019s barely seeing her on FaceTime at all. Limiting his trauma is the best thing for him until you can get a professional involved if she\u2019s not going to FaceTime him frequently and on a set schedule. \n\nI wish you and your children good luck.", "Damn, your wife suck. She abandoned her 2 todlers for something she should have done before having kids? NTA, working 70hrs and dealing with 1 hour meltdowns by yourself is not something I would do, protect the little peace you have.\n\nWhat's gonna happen if your wife \"makes it out there?\" She's not coming back, is she?", "She chose to leave the kids, so she doesn't get to play the \"it's not right to keep them from me\" card. She left you to handle all of the hard stuff while she flitted off to do what she wanted. \n\nTemporarily stopping the calls, imo, is okay as long as you work with your son (preferably with a therapist) to turn the calls from trauma-inducers to healthy communication. \n\nNTA for now.", "NTA\n\nYour wife chose to ignore her responsibilities as a parent. These are the consequences. \n\nYour son\u2019s needs trump hers.", "NTA. You\u2019re not keeping her from the kids. She abandoned them and you for some selfish wannabe dream because she has life regrets. She could have chose to do this later in life after the kids grow up. She needs to arrange for more visits.", "Sounds like her fantasy is more important than being a mother. She wants to play a role via FaceTime and subject the kids to crying fits. You made the right decision. \n\nNTA", "ESH, only because you supported this ridiculous idea at all. How are you two making this work? Why does anyone think this is appropriate with two young children in the mix? Those kids deserve better from both of you, frankly.", "\\>  she told me that she wanted to move there temporarily by herself to see if she could \u201cmake it there\u201d (she\u2019s an artist).  \n\n\nESH.  She sucks cause she is ditching her children.  You suck cause you told her to go ahead and do it.", "ESH. There is nothing normal about this situation. You let this woman traumatize your kids by leaving. SHE DESERTED YOUR FAMILY WITH YOUR BLESSING!!!!!!!!!. It's insane!!!!!!!!!!!! Those kids have not 1, but 2 irresponsible parents. If she wants to leave, fine. But you can't traumatize kids, over & over again!!!!!!", "NTA and your wife is a shitty parent. She leaves and then hardly contacts them! Find a lawyer, she doesn\u2019t deserve a family.", "NTA. She abandoned her family and it's making your children flip out when she decided to make time for them. I'd be filing for custody and using this as abandonment", "NTA. She abandoned her family for her selfish goals and wants you to patch it over. This is like the reverse of the traditional marriage with an absent father and mom left to clean up the mess. \n\nTell her if she wants to see her kids she can come home, and I hope you have a good divorce lawyer. \n\nYour marriage is weird. I have 2 little kids too, and if my wife told me that my response would be that if she leaves the marriage is over.", "NTA - but I think your marriage is over.\n\nAbsurd that your wife decided to just ditch all of you to go \u201clive her dream\u201d while your children are this little.\n\nThis must be so traumatic for your son who\u2019s used to his mommy and misses her.\n\nWhat your wife is doing to a callous and selfish. \n\nIt sounds like living her dream means living a child free life.\n\nGood luck .", "ESH. It\u2019s definitely not healthy for your kids to never see her. They are so young, this whole situation is going to damage them emotionally, and for what? Why did you even agree to this? What is she actually going to gain? Some youthful dream of delusion where she ignores the responsibilities she has as a mother and partner to you? What happen in a year if she\u2019s \u201cmade it\u201d? She never comes back for her kids or you? You say you don\u2019t want her to resent you, but this whole situation is going to end up with all of you resenting each other and your kids are going to suffer the most", "NTA\n\nYour wife has abandoned her children.", "NTA\n\nYour son is not in a good space when it come to his mom being gone and maybe you lil girl too over the months. A child need parents to be there physicaly to be stable. I would not consider a 1year on NYC for an artist a dream to get don on her bucket list at the current stage of the kids lives. \n\nINFO\n\ndid you and your wife talk about the possibily of if the first year was not good she extend her stay? Or about if she think about what compensation to offer to the boy like reading or sorto playing and telling stories ? OP you should check with a therapist for what is necessare for you son wellbeing over being abandon by his my when she end the call. Also in 2 weeks she call the first 3 days and baby was melting his heart out or she call every couple of days ?", "NTA. Maybe agree with her that if you facetime again, immediately afterwards you'll call her (audio only) and turn the volume down so she can hear but not be heard. Let her listen in on any meltdown. After the son has calmed down and maybe has gone to bed, then call her back and discuss further.", "NTA- you need to prioritize your son\u2019s health and get him to a therapist.", "NTA", "NTA. She chose to leave her very young children. You're just trying to stay afloat in the situation.", "ESH. I think this is ridiculous. As a mid30s woman with two kids myself, I think you guys are totally off your rockers that she has left her two young children like this. It is no surprise that your son is a wreck. What mature parent does this or agrees to it? She needs to grow up and you guys need get your acts together to be present for your kids. You don\u2019t have kids and then decide to bail for a year.", "NTA.", "ESH because you both agreed to this horrible unnecessary situation for your children. \n\nYour son is having meltdowns because this is an earth shattering change for a toddler and it\u2019s normal for him to miss his mom. You shouldn\u2019t reduce contact just because it\u2019s easier for you, because you agreed to this. \n\nWhat exactly are you guys going to do if she does \u201cmake it there?\u201d Will she stay permanently? \n\nAlso, she\u2019s only planning on seeing them ONE TIME in an entire year? I\u2019m shocked by the whole thing.", "I'm going to say ESH. Kids need to have both parents in their lives wherever possible. That includes when one has to go away. Yes, dealing with meltdowns suck. That doesn't mean you should cut all contact between the kids and their mom.  \n\nYour wife sucks because she picked a bad time to go live out her dream. A dream like this should be lived out before marriage and/or kids or when spouse and kids can go with.", "ESH - dang she just took off and is mad at you for your kid not dealing with it well? Dang.  \n\nBut also- yeah they have to chat. Prep the kiddo, show him love, and have something fun to do right after so he he has something to look forward to", "ESH .\n\nI don\u2019t see how moving to NYC is necessary to do art. If she\u2019s wasn\u2019t able to make enough money to off art in your current city (which I\u2019m assuming has a much lower cost of living), she won\u2019t make it in NYC where housing is super unaffordable. But okay\u2026.\n\nHer wanting to move to NYC on very short notice is immature, especially when your  kids are still needing care with no plan on how to pay for the trip or take care of the kids. Honestly, it sounds like there maybe someone else. Regardless of whether I\u2019m right or wrong, you shouldn\u2019t have said yes to all this when you knew  you probably can\u2019t balance working and taking care of the kids. \n\nIdea: Do FaceTimes less frequently. Why don\u2019t you take photos and videos of the kids during special moments (Ex: then playing together), and send them to her every week or so. Like a photo/video diary update. That way she can still see the kids and you don\u2019t have to deal with tantrums.", "ETA. It sounds.like he's having a meltdown because his parent has literally moved away recently , this is a huge change in a kids life. Facetiming 3x in 2 weeks is a surpringly low number and it sounds like his emotional needs from his mom aren't being met due to lack of time available for him. He misses her. Let him video her as often as he wants even if it's everyday. Im wondering HOW both of you are okay with this arrangement ? Do you not even like eachother or are you both emotionless beings ?", "ESH. You and your wife need to put the children you chose to have before your very expensive \u201cwhat if\u201d dreams. Sometimes you can\u2019t \u201chave it all\u201d when you\u2019ve committed to responsibilities as an adult, and that\u2019s just something you have to accept. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like this plan makes any sense for the well being of your family\u2026. Not to be the \u201cdivorce your spouse\u201d comment, but maybe your goals are not aligned and you deserve child support/a different arrangement. I\u2019m sorry you and your kids are dealing with this.", "She chose to leave, like for no reason basically?  That's a bad mom. However, I would still let her see the kids on FaceTime... But I don't think I could be with someone who just does that. I love my girl so so much that I have literally no idea how I could go even a week without her.", "N T A for wanting to stop the facetime. My parents left me with my grandparents so that they could try to \"make it there\" in a new country. There was no facetime back then. I was 2. I reunited with them when I was 3. I don't remember any of it. I'm sure your toddlers will be fine.\n\nESH (mainly bc you're assholes to yourselves) for putting yourselves in this shitty situation. Sounds like really poor planning.", "ESH. They\u2019re babies and they need both of their parents. I can\u2019t believe you looked at each and thought this was a good idea and arrangement for a YEAR.", "YTA; meltdowns sure suck, but cutting off his contact is even less healthy for him. You're picking the option that easiest for you rather than best for him.\n\n Your son is having meltdowns because he misses his mother. Its been two weeks, but that also means its only been two weeks. Its new, its a big change, and its strange. He doesn't understand why she's gone and he wants to be with her; that's normal. Having even less time with his mother isn't the solution, that's just going to give the little boy even more separation anxiety than this terrible idea was already going to give.", "There is a lot going on here but for this very specific thing YTA. Most of this is on your wife but not letting the kids see her makes you the a hole.", "YTA for this specific thing and for making that decision without having an actual discussion with your wife. The other decisions made were equally bad (her leaving, you endorsing it etc) but you asked about ending her interactions with the kids and no, that is not right and not your sole decision. Meltdowns are going to happen since she has only been gone a couple of weeks but eventually your son will get used to it. Get a child therapist involved if need be but at 2 1/2, meltdowns and tantrums are just part of the parenting gig. \n\nIf you end your wife interacting with the kids you are likely ending your marriage and potentially getting yourself into a situation where she files for custody.", "You cannot unilaterally deny your children from seeing their mother, you have zero right to do that. \n\nThat is what makes you the asshole in this situation.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
