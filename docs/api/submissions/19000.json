Some time ago my wife had mentioned having regrets about never having lived in NYC since that was always her dream. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time until a few months ago when she told me that she wanted to move there temporarily by herself to see if she could \u201cmake it there\u201d (she\u2019s an artist). After a lot of discussion we agreed upon her living there for a year and she said she would plan on coming home once to visit during that time at Christmas. This was a difficult decision for me since I work 60-70 hours a week and we have 2 young kids but I don\u2019t want her to have any regrets or end up resenting me and luckily my parents have been willing to help out a lot. We were able to find her a decent sublet that she moved into about 2 weeks ago. Since she has been gone she has FaceTimed me to see the kids about 3 times. That\u2019s great and all because I want her to see the kids but after every call our son has had a complete meltdown. After the most recent call it took me an hour to calm him down. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy for him and honestly it\u2019s a lot for me to deal with on top of everything else. Recently I told her that I do not want to FaceTime her anymore with the kids for that reason and she was very upset saying it\u2019s not right for me to keep the kids from her etc, I just have to learn how to deal with meltdowns and that eventually they will get used to seeing her on FaceTime.

Your children are so young. So so young. I get why your wife felt bad about not making some of her dreams come true, which lots of parents have to come to terms with, but she essentially abandoned her young children when developmentally they needed her the most. And it wasn\u2019t like she was in the military and had no choice, she chose to leave, both them and you and the life you built together. I just, I don\u2019t even know what to say.\n\nI think you need to speak to a child therapist to see what the best path forward should be. This is a traumatic experience for your children. You and them need help. She hasn\u2019t wanted to at least speak with them once a day? Read them a book before bed time (get two books, she keeps one and you keep one)? \n\nThe family law attorney in me wants to warn you, you may be coming to a fork in the road. What happens when your wife hasn\u2019t made it work in one year? Will she want to stay in NYC? Will she want to come home and admit defeat? If she comes home, will she be content with her life? Fulfilled?\n\nMy mom was not meant to be a mother, and she left. My dad had to raise us by himself without much help. We saw our mom occasionally but she lived the life of a single person, not a single mother. You should probably talk to a divorce attorney in your state and just educate yourself on what would happen if your wife decides to not come home. What rights do you have, what rights would she have, what would happen with your kids? \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA because your son is so young, he doesn\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t see his mom in person, and why he\u2019s barely seeing her on FaceTime at all. Limiting his trauma is the best thing for him until you can get a professional involved if she\u2019s not going to FaceTime him frequently and on a set schedule. \n\nI wish you and your children good luck.", "Damn, your wife suck. She abandoned her 2 todlers for something she should have done before having kids? NTA, working 70hrs and dealing with 1 hour meltdowns by yourself is not something I would do, protect the little peace you have.\n\nWhat's gonna happen if your wife \"makes it out there?\" She's not coming back, is she?", "She chose to leave the kids, so she doesn't get to play the \"it's not right to keep them from me\" card. She left you to handle all of the hard stuff while she flitted off to do what she wanted. \n\nTemporarily stopping the calls, imo, is okay as long as you work with your son (preferably with a therapist) to turn the calls from trauma-inducers to healthy communication. \n\nNTA for now.", "NTA\n\nYour wife chose to ignore her responsibilities as a parent. These are the consequences. \n\nYour son\u2019s needs trump hers.", "NTA. You\u2019re not keeping her from the kids. She abandoned them and you for some selfish wannabe dream because she has life regrets. She could have chose to do this later in life after the kids grow up. She needs to arrange for more visits.", "Sounds like her fantasy is more important than being a mother. She wants to play a role via FaceTime and subject the kids to crying fits. You made the right decision. \n\nNTA", "ESH, only because you supported this ridiculous idea at all. How are you two making this work? Why does anyone think this is appropriate with two young children in the mix?

You let this woman traumatize your kids by leaving. SHE DESERTED YOUR FAMILY WITH YOUR BLESSING!!!!!!!!!. It's insane!!!!!!!!!!!! Those kids have not 1, but 2 irresponsible parents.

Find a lawyer, she doesn\u2019t deserve a family.", "NTA. She abandoned her family and it's making your children flip out when she decided to make time for them. I'd be filing for custody and using this as abandonment", "NTA. She abandoned her family for her selfish goals and wants you to patch it over. This is like the reverse of the traditional marriage with an absent father and mom left to clean up the mess. \n\nTell her if she wants to see her kids she can come home, and I hope you have a good divorce lawyer. \n\nYour marriage is weird. I have 2 little kids too, and if my wife told me that my response would be that if she leaves the marriage is over.", "NTA - but I think your marriage is over.\n\nAbsurd that your wife decided to just ditch all of you to go \u201clive her dream\u201d while your children are this little.\n\nThis must be so traumatic for your son who\u2019s used to his mommy and misses her.\n\nWhat your wife is doing to a callous and selfish. \n\nIt sounds like living her dream means living a child free life.\n\nGood luck .", "ESH. It\u2019s definitely not healthy for your kids to never see her. They are so young, this whole situation is going to damage them emotionally, and for what? Why did you even agree to this? What is she actually going to gain? Some youthful dream of delusion where she ignores the responsibilities she has as a mother and partner to you? What happen in a year if she\u2019s \u201cmade it\u201d? She never comes back for her kids or you?

Or about if she think about what compensation to offer to the boy like reading or sorto playing and telling stories ? OP you should check with a therapist for what is necessare for you son wellbeing over being abandon by his my when she end the call. Also in 2 weeks she call the first 3 days and baby was melting his heart out or she call every couple of days ?", "NTA. Maybe agree with her that if you facetime again, immediately afterwards you'll call her (audio only) and turn the volume down so she can hear but not be heard. Let her listen in on any meltdown. After the son has calmed down and maybe has gone to bed, then call her back and discuss further.", "NTA- you need to prioritize your son\u2019s health and get him to a therapist.", "NTA", "NTA. She chose to leave her very young children. You're just trying to stay afloat in the situation.", "ESH. I think this is ridiculous. As a mid30s woman with two kids myself, I think you guys are totally off your rockers that she has left her two young children like this. It is no surprise that your son is a wreck. What mature parent does this or agrees to it? She needs to grow up and you guys need get your acts together to be present for your kids. You don\u2019t have kids and then decide to bail for a year.", "NTA.", "ESH because you both agreed to this horrible unnecessary situation for your children. \n\nYour son is having meltdowns because this is an earth shattering change for a toddler and it\u2019s normal for him to miss his mom. You shouldn\u2019t reduce contact just because it\u2019s easier for you, because you agreed to this. \n\nWhat exactly are you guys going to do if she does \u201cmake it there?\u201d Will she stay permanently? \n\nAlso, she\u2019s only planning on seeing them ONE TIME in an entire year? I\u2019m shocked by the whole thing.", "I'm going to say ESH. Kids need to have both parents in their lives wherever possible. That includes when one has to go away. Yes, dealing with meltdowns suck. That doesn't mean you should cut all contact between the kids and their mom.  \n\nYour wife sucks because she picked a bad time to go live out her dream. A dream like this should be lived out before marriage and/or kids or when spouse and kids can go with.", "ESH - dang she just took off and is mad at you for your kid not dealing with it well? Dang.  \n\nBut also- yeah they have to chat. Prep the kiddo, show him love, and have something fun to do right after so he he has something to look forward to", "ESH .\n\nI don\u2019t see how moving to NYC is necessary to do art. If she\u2019s wasn\u2019t able to make enough money to off art in your current city (which I\u2019m assuming has a much lower cost of living), she won\u2019t make it in NYC where housing is super unaffordable. But okay\u2026.\n\nHer wanting to move to NYC on very short notice is immature, especially when your  kids are still needing care with no plan on how to pay for the trip or take care of the kids. Honestly, it sounds like there maybe someone else. Regardless of whether I\u2019m right or wrong, you shouldn\u2019t have said yes to all this when you knew  you probably can\u2019t balance working and taking care of the kids. \n\nIdea: Do FaceTimes less frequently. Why don\u2019t you take photos and videos of the kids during special moments (Ex: then playing together), and send them to her every week or so. Like a photo/video diary update. That way she can still see the kids and you don\u2019t have to deal with tantrums.", "ETA. It sounds.like he's having a meltdown because his parent has literally moved away recently , this is a huge change in a kids life. Facetiming 3x in 2 weeks is a surpringly low number and it sounds like his emotional needs from his mom aren't being met due to lack of time available for him. He misses her. Let him video her as often as he wants even if it's everyday. Im wondering HOW both of you are okay with this arrangement ? Do you not even like eachother or are you both emotionless beings ?", "ESH. You and your wife need to put the children you chose to have before your very expensive \u201cwhat if\u201d dreams. Sometimes you can\u2019t \u201chave it all\u201d when you\u2019ve committed to responsibilities as an adult, and that\u2019s just something you have to accept. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like this plan makes any sense for the well being of your family\u2026. Not to be the \u201cdivorce your spouse\u201d comment, but maybe your goals are not aligned and you deserve child support/a different arrangement. I\u2019m sorry you and your kids are dealing with this.", "She chose to leave, like for no reason basically?  That's a bad mom. However, I would still let her see the kids on FaceTime...

I can\u2019t believe you looked at each and thought this was a good idea and arrangement for a YEAR.", "YTA; meltdowns sure suck, but cutting off his contact is even less healthy for him. You're picking the option that easiest for you rather than best for him.\n\n Your son is having meltdowns because he misses his mother. Its been two weeks, but that also means its only been two weeks. Its new, its a big change, and its strange. He doesn't understand why she's gone and he wants to be with her; that's normal. Having even less time with his mother isn't the solution, that's just going to give the little boy even more separation anxiety than this terrible idea was already going to give.", "There is a lot going on here but for this very specific thing YTA. Most of this is on your wife but not letting the kids see her makes you the a hole.", "YTA for this specific thing and for making that decision without having an actual discussion with your wife. The other decisions made were equally bad (her leaving, you endorsing it etc) but you asked about ending her interactions with the kids and no, that is not right and not your sole decision. Meltdowns are going to happen since she has only been gone a couple of weeks but eventually your son will get used to it. Get a child therapist involved if need be but at 2 1/2, meltdowns and tantrums are just part of the parenting gig. \n\nIf you end your wife interacting with the kids you are likely ending your marriage and potentially getting yourself into a situation where she files for custody.", "You cannot unilaterally deny your children from seeing their mother, you have zero right to do that. \n\nThat is what makes you the asshole in this situation.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Taking a year away to find out if you can make it as an artist when you have 2 young kids is selfish. But, you\u2019re not off the hook for allowing her to go either. You\u2019re both responsible for letting your kids down when they need you both the most. Did either of you think about how this would affect these kids???

And it was awful.  It broke my heart.  I texted them all day long and called to say good night and hear about their day EVERY DAY.  we visited as often as possible and they would be brought by to see us while working ect we saw them at least 4 times a week and I still called to say good night in those days.  Just being not in the same house even though we were in the same city was a nightmare.  I missed them sooooo much and worked very very hard to change our circumstances so we could be back with them.  I cannot even imagine leaving my current 2 year old for A WHOLE YEAR. to not be able to see them or hug them or be there when they wake up to nightmares or put them to bed at night..I just.. I cannot fathom it.  Your wife has some kind of something going on more than just wanting to see if she can make a career there.  Especially considering you can make a career in art on the internet easier than any in person location this just baffles me.  You are definitely not the ah here.  She sounds like she needs help and needs to think long and hard on of she really wants to be a mom, or just like the occasional person in these kids lives.  If she can't there for them on these years when they need her the most they won't ever count on her to be there at any other time  in their lives.  I'm sorry but shame on her.  I hope you and your kids can find some peace in your lives.  Best of luck op", "I might look for a therapist not only for children but one familiar with family systems.  The dad and his two children are all dealing with trama right now.  I don\u2019t know who in their right minds leaves two children (one being a literal baby!) to go be an artist.  Plenty of parents are artists, this is just abandoning your family without acknowledging that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.", "I REALLY wanted to say that he should contact a lawyer and file for divorce for her abandoning the family and get full custody.

You do not need to have to spend hours calmind down your 2.5 year old who does not understand why Mama is bye bye and isn't coming home.\n\nHonestly, your wife is a major AH. As a parent, her dreams (either person's dreams - this is not just her because she is female) comes AFTER the health and wellbeing of the children. This was not a job necessity like a military deployment or a temporary job assignment elsewhere. \n\nYour wife has chosen to fully abandon her children for at least a year. I promise that this is impacting them far more than you know. \n\nIf your wife was a good artist she could make it from anywhere with showings in galleries in NYC. She doesn't need to live there to do so. She has functionally abandoned you and the children to chase a dream that has absolutely no benefit to you or the children. \n\nA year is a VERY long time for children and this is and will continue to create abandonment issues.

If he continues to indulge her at the cost of his children's peace, he'll cause just as much damage as she has. \n\nSomeone needs to advocate for those kids and demand that she either be all in or all out.", "This is a plot from HIMYM.", "I actually had the same question! It's like she is coming to \"making it in the art world\" from a perspective that's old. You do not need to live there full time right now. You can network online, then travel every couple of months for meetings, gallery openings, etc. Also, does she even have a portfolio?", "Are you even alright? she literally abandoned her own kids for a funky ass dream of hers which she should've done much earlier or much later in life. She is knowing leaving her young kids and then acting like a victim in a situation she perpetrated. He's living like a single father when he isn't, she should stop being selfish and step tf up.

I just read this one to my wife and she\u2019s upset now.\n\nNTA.", "Definitely a trauma informed therapist.", "I didn\u2019t go as far to say that only because, who knows, the wife may have some postpartum depression, or some other mental health issue going on right now and both parties might not even realize it. Plus, OP is doing his best to keep his family intact, and until he decides that is not what is best for the family, I want that for him as well. It feels like the whole family has been part of this decision and he\u2019s stuck in a tough spot and really trying to make the best of it.", "There must be more to this story because as a mom, I just cannot imagine doing this.", "I feel like putting your kid through atleast an hour long meltdown because he misses his mom because she abandoned him is a bigger issue than not putting him through that. Toddlers are often very out of sight out mind. It can't cause him as much upset and distress if he's not constantly melting down because he misses his mommy.", "Yeah I have dreams too\u2026 I\u2019m waiting until my kids are at least 18. WTF is this mom thinking?", "I agree so much with this.  A good artist is a good artist anywhere. \nShe missed her window to self-sacrifice for her artwork when she became a mom. \nYou can't artificially re-create the whole \"starving artist\" bit in hopes you'll \"make it big as an artist.\" Usually, you had to die to make it big in the art world.\n\nShe sounds undeserving of such a supportive husband. I hope he realizes his selflessness in indulging her selfish whims is harmful as well to their children. \n\nNTA", "I can call to FaceTime my husband from the grocery store after just leaving the house and our 3 year old loses his mind like he hasn't heard from me in years.

Shes going and living her dream while he handles almost everything. How are they paying for this extra apartment? For a year? If she doesn't make it in a year, is she just going to stay there until \"she makes it\"?  \nWhile she's happy and getting fulfillment, what about these two kids?

How is it a bigger regret not living alone in New York City than missing out on a year of your children's lives? I can't even fathom how OP could go along with such a request. I'd let her sign the divorce papers with the same pen as the lease. You already know how she feels about her family.", "I'm wondering if she makes it, will she want to go home?", "Not letting the kids ever see mom seems like a punishment for them that they don\u2019t deserve", "You\u2019d kind of hope so.

I would be surprised if she ever had plans to return. To give up a year in your children's lives to live in the most overrated, overpriced city in the US. Sounds more like regretting settling down and starting a family.", "My thoughts exactly. She waited until not one kid, but two kids, both of them under the age of three. She left her husband in a very overwhelming position.", "Definitely a trauma informed therapist.", "Women get left with kids all the time.  What\u2019s the sexist deal?
