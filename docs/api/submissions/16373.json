Yes, people who keep dogs will usually get another dog when the last one passed, and it's not right for your family for one kid to insist on never getting a pet again. But I think this would have gone better has your son felt he had any say in the decision? If you'd allowed him to express a timeline that he thinks would be best for him? Ect.", "#YTA\n\nHe he's in a very emotional space right now. He's learning how to express his feelings in an \"adult\" way. He's learning how to convert emotions into words that others can understand. He's learning how to cope with a tragically traumatic loss. He's processing his grievance and most importantly, HE HAD TO SEEK THERAPY FOR IT.\n\nAnd you invalidated every single one of his feelings and thoughts by getting a new dog so soon. You should've at the very least included him in the process of looking for, visiting, and adopting the new dog.\n\nYou and your husband are the asshole. Your daughter wouldn't need therapy because she didn't get a new dog. Your son very well might.\n\nAgain, you ARE the asshole here.", "Honestly, I think you handled this situation poorly. Giving one kid the gift of a pet is tricky anyway since you're going to struggle to find your son a comparable present for his birthday, which will no doubt feel like favouritism. That's before you even delve into the minimizing of his trauma.\n\nYou say your son is in therapy. You had a resource there to help ease him into the idea of getting another family dog. YTA.", "YTA you created a big mess unnecessarily. Your son is grieving to the point of needing therapy. Did you not consult the therapist? Your daughter would have been fine with something else for her birthday. A year waiting could have made all the difference to your son. He\u2019ll probably be ready in time for a new dog. Why did you not give him the time he needs? Now you need to fix this but I don\u2019t know how without hurting your daughter!", "My dog passed away and my brother tried to bring me a new one. And truth is, it took me a long time to stop feeling disloyal to my deceased life partner of a dog who'd been with me for more than 10 years. Logic tells me that First dog would never begrudge me loving another dog. But, emotions oftentimes aren't \"logical.\"\n\nSo, on the strength of that, I would have been unwilling to *force* my son to move forward. We only move forward when we are ready after all. NTA. Just trying to divide the baby doesn't make us Solomon. We make inconsiderate and less than strictly fair tradeoffs all the time in an effort to do the best we can\n\nReally hoping your son would love something he said he wasn't ready for is all that happened. It was a disconnect - not murder. But, I definitely get that the puppy sent him over the edge. He's just not \"ready\" to love another dog yet. (Hugs. Being The Mom is Really Hard Sometimes.)", "YTA.\n\n>My Daughter was sad too, but she moved on very quickly. \n\nI suspect that she could have coped well if you hadn't got her a dog.\n\n>Our dog was his best friend.\n\n>He went to therapy to get to terms with it.\n\n>He could not stand the idea and he started developing disdain for his sister for bringing it up all the time.\n\nI would expect him to cope less well if you did get her one.\n\n>we really thought about our Son too.

Your son was SUFFERING. \n\nYou would have been a massive AH just for ignoring that, because it seems that despite the fact that your son was open and communicative about his feelings, you literally did absolutely nothing to validate them, or to help or support him in his very real grief at the loss of a beloved friend.  \n\nBut then you not only treated his grief like it was no big deal and like it should just somehow magically go away . . . you *purposefully chose to do something that he told you would make him feel exponentially worse*. You literally heard him tell you what would feel most traumatic to him while he was trying to take the time to grieve this loss, and thought to yourself, \"You know what would be a smart thing to do? EXACTLY WHAT MY KID SAYS WOULD FEEL MOST PAINFUL TO HIM!\"\n\n> I really hoped that my son would like the pup once he sees it and maybe even become friends with her.\n\nWTF? In what world did that seem to make any sense? Nope. I don't buy it. You weren't thinking about your son at all. You were literally just making shit up in your head to justify ignoring your son's very clear communication about his needs and his grief, to do what made your daughter (and I'm guessing you) happy. What a shitty, shitty thing to do to a suffering child.\n\nYour daughter didn't need a new puppy, she wanted one. And she could have had one eventually, one your son had had time to grieve. But you don't even care enough about him to give him that. What a miserable, hateful example of preferential treatment you've shown here. Your poor son must feel so alone. I don't blame him for not wanting to be anywhere near you. Why would he, when you've shown him that he means nothing to you at all?

First of all, getting a new puppy that belongs to your daughter, as opposed to a family pet, was high risk anyway.

By your own admission your daughter was fine, she could have easily survived a little longer without having a dog. \n\nThirdly, why on earth didn't you use the therapist? Discuss ways to help with the transition. Have him involved in the adoption process etc.  \n\nI don't even know how you begin fixing this one.", "YTA - Your daughter being sad because she wants a dog is not the same thing as your son being traumatized by the loss of a dog.", "NTA", "INFO: does your son have anything else going on other than the grief of losing his beloved dog? this seems like a very extreme reaction, so I wondered if there was another underlying issue that you're not revealing here.", "YTA\n\n> My In Laws are lashing out against my Husband and I for ,,favoring\u201c our daughter and put her wishes over our sons mental health. \n\nYup.

Five months is a pretty big chunk of time.\n\nUnless something is truly pathologically wrong here, I suspect that being around the new dog will ultimately help your son move on, even if he had a strong negative reaction to it upfront. I just don't see a situation happening where he's six months down the line and still unable to function with another dog in the house, and if he is...the dog is the least of your problems at that point.", "Soft YTA for not giving your son enough time to mourn the death of his friend and not considering his feelings.

I think you have problems beyond the dog. Your son needs therapy for more than dog grief.   Your son sounds like he\u2019s in crisis for reasons other than the dog.  The dog is a symptom of something going on that you are neglecting.", "YTA. In addition to him not being ready- You all should have gone as a family to choose a new family dog together. Not reveal her as a surprise gift to just your daughter.  You didn\u2019t give your son an opportunity to bond with a dog that would have reminded him of happy memories of his last dog. He needs to learn he can\u2019t avoid the memories of his past friend. He needs to get to a place where he can remember and think of him fondly in a way that brings joy.", "NTA that is the cycle of life. It\u2019s a hard lesson but is reality.

Was the family never to get another dog bc son loved a pet that died?\n\nAbsolutely freaking out because another puppy exists seems super extreme. \n\nWhat does his therapist say about his \u201ctrauma\u201d from a natural occurrence that is holding the rest of the family hostage?\n\nI don\u2019t understand being traumatized by a pets death, unless it was sudden or horrible?\n\nMy family lost a dog and several cats over the course of my childhood.

This should have been a family discussion with clear boundaries and a clear timeline. This would allow your 10m to work through his feelings about it and come to terms with it.

Sounds like you need to grow up and stop insulting children.", "It is good that they arranged therapy. However, sending your child to therapy and actually listening to, caring about, and validating your child\u2019s needs yourself are two very different things. Going to therapy didn\u2019t erase OP\u2019s son\u2019s need to be heard by his parents.", "> Five Months of intense grief over a dead dog?\n\nExtreme, right? A couple of people have suggested it might not just be about the dog: if he's this fucked up by it, there may well be some deeper more serious issue. That makes a lot of sense to me. The dog issue is a symptom of something darker and deeper", ":-(", "Yeah it's quite a pickle. I guess OP needs to talk to the kid's therapist. Shame they didn't do that before getting the new dog.  I'd not be surprised if they just leave him with granny, since they clearly favour the girl", "And the sister is needing a dog to on the other side, she is suffering from not having that companion.", "I haven't had another pet since my childhood dog got hit by a car and died.   \n\n\nI was scarred for a long time, I was around 13 when this happened, now I'm 30 and still struggle with the thought of getting a pet because of the amount of pain that the loss caused me.", "It's not the fact that they didn't adhere to the boy's demands that's the issue. Their management of this entire situation is a shitshow. Of course it's fair to want to get a new dog but why so quickly? Why didn't they talk it over with the therapist and strategize getting a new family dog (not one that belongs to the sister) over a more realistic timeframe?", "And a young girls wants should not come at the expense of a young boys mental health", "Very true. Otherwise it's just subcontracting the caring because you can't be bothered.", "She didn\u2019t need a dog, she wanted a dog. While the son was traumatized to the point of therapy. They just retraumatized him all over again", "Maybe the fact that you haven't taken that step is one of the things that is keeping you stuck in that level of grief. Imagine how much passive hurt you have dwelled in out of fear of the active hurt of getting a new pet. But on the other side of that short period of active hurt is where lasting peace is. You don't want to be like the parents whose dead child's bedroom is an untouched memorial decades later\u2014that's not healthy. You are suffering more by letting it fester.", "Genuinely blows my mind that the therapist doesn't appear to have been involved at all during this process.", "Really falling to see how five months is \"so quickly.\" The way that OP handled actually introducing the dog, by dropping it on the son as a surprise, absolutely sucked and is what brings them close to an a-hole vote from me. But I think they acted in a realistic way, and the son got more support for a pet loss than most kids ever get. It's always hardest when it's your first pet and you're a kid with limited experience with death, but he has to be able to live in a world that isn't solely occupied with insulating him from negative emotions.", "Perhaps she does need it and is just able to process her emotions better. It\u2019s not like they killed or abandoned the other dog in replacement of this one. An appropriate grieving time has passed and the sons unable to process emotions doesn\u2019t override the daughters feelings. It\u2019s abnormal to throw a fit of this proportion over the cycle of life.", "I know that you are right. Besides the fact that I'm still scarred from what happened, I'm just also not sure I could give any pet the home that it needs.   \nI love animals. Love pets of friends, and family but I still definitely need to get over that last hurdle. Maybe one day when I'm more financially secure too.", "At that age, with that timeline, it\u2019s not that abnormal. It blows my mind that people are saying the sister having a dog when she was only mildly sad is more important than the mental health of their other child."]}
