Yes, people who keep dogs will usually get another dog when the last one passed, and it's not right for your family for one kid to insist on never getting a pet again. But I think this would have gone better has your son felt he had any say in the decision? If you'd allowed him to express a timeline that he thinks would be best for him? Ect.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'm the top comment so I'll add that YTA and your edits make you moreso. \"This is the family dog, not my daughter's\"-- that's worse. You understand how getting an animal for the whole family as your daughter's birthday gift is worse, right. \"If my son wants to chose a new dog besides the one that we presented as a gift to you, we're doing to do that. Oh, he doesn't want one? I guess we'll rehome this cute puppy that we presented as a gift to you\". Good job taking a situation you really fucked up in a way that hurt your son into a situation that hurts BOTH your children instead, really truly a *great* improvement over what your household looked like before you came to reddit and asked your family what to do. For the record, *personally* my point was \"you shouldn't have done this, you're an asshole\" not \"try to undo the decision by getting rid of the dog\". You can't undo this decision, you did this, you need to figure out a way to move forward that keeps *everyone's* feelings in mind. Not just your son, and also not just your daughter.", "#YTA\n\nHe he's in a very emotional space right now. He's learning how to express his feelings in an \"adult\" way. He's learning how to convert emotions into words that others can understand. He's learning how to cope with a tragically traumatic loss. He's processing his grievance and most importantly, HE HAD TO SEEK THERAPY FOR IT.\n\nAnd you invalidated every single one of his feelings and thoughts by getting a new dog so soon. You should've at the very least included him in the process of looking for, visiting, and adopting the new dog.\n\nYou and your husband are the asshole. Your daughter wouldn't need therapy because she didn't get a new dog. Your son very well might.\n\nAgain, you ARE the asshole here.", "Honestly, I think you handled this situation poorly. Giving one kid the gift of a pet is tricky anyway since you're going to struggle to find your son a comparable present for his birthday, which will no doubt feel like favouritism. That's before you even delve into the minimizing of his trauma.\n\nYou say your son is in therapy. You had a resource there to help ease him into the idea of getting another family dog. YTA.", "YTA you created a big mess unnecessarily. Your son is grieving to the point of needing therapy. Did you not consult the therapist? Your daughter would have been fine with something else for her birthday. A year waiting could have made all the difference to your son. He\u2019ll probably be ready in time for a new dog. Why did you not give him the time he needs? Now you need to fix this but I don\u2019t know how without hurting your daughter!", "My dog passed away and my brother tried to bring me a new one. And truth is, it took me a long time to stop feeling disloyal to my deceased life partner of a dog who'd been with me for more than 10 years. Logic tells me that First dog would never begrudge me loving another dog. But, emotions oftentimes aren't \"logical.\"\n\nSo, on the strength of that, I would have been unwilling to *force* my son to move forward. We only move forward when we are ready after all. NTA. Just trying to divide the baby doesn't make us Solomon. We make inconsiderate and less than strictly fair tradeoffs all the time in an effort to do the best we can\n\nReally hoping your son would love something he said he wasn't ready for is all that happened. It was a disconnect - not murder. But, I definitely get that the puppy sent him over the edge. He's just not \"ready\" to love another dog yet. (Hugs. Being The Mom is Really Hard Sometimes.)", "YTA.\n\n>My Daughter was sad too, but she moved on very quickly. \n\nI suspect that she could have coped well if you hadn't got her a dog.\n\n>Our dog was his best friend.\n\n>He went to therapy to get to terms with it.\n\n>He could not stand the idea and he started developing disdain for his sister for bringing it up all the time.\n\nI would expect him to cope less well if you did get her one.\n\n>we really thought about our Son too. It just didn\u2019t work out the way we wanted.\n\nDid you really?", "YTA\n\nYour daughter was sad. Your son was SUFFERING. \n\nYou would have been a massive AH just for ignoring that, because it seems that despite the fact that your son was open and communicative about his feelings, you literally did absolutely nothing to validate them, or to help or support him in his very real grief at the loss of a beloved friend.  \n\nBut then you not only treated his grief like it was no big deal and like it should just somehow magically go away . . . you *purposefully chose to do something that he told you would make him feel exponentially worse*. You literally heard him tell you what would feel most traumatic to him while he was trying to take the time to grieve this loss, and thought to yourself, \"You know what would be a smart thing to do? EXACTLY WHAT MY KID SAYS WOULD FEEL MOST PAINFUL TO HIM!\"\n\n> I really hoped that my son would like the pup once he sees it and maybe even become friends with her.\n\nWTF? In what world did that seem to make any sense? Nope. I don't buy it. You weren't thinking about your son at all. You were literally just making shit up in your head to justify ignoring your son's very clear communication about his needs and his grief, to do what made your daughter (and I'm guessing you) happy. What a shitty, shitty thing to do to a suffering child.\n\nYour daughter didn't need a new puppy, she wanted one. And she could have had one eventually, one your son had had time to grieve. But you don't even care enough about him to give him that. What a miserable, hateful example of preferential treatment you've shown here. Your poor son must feel so alone. I don't blame him for not wanting to be anywhere near you. Why would he, when you've shown him that he means nothing to you at all? Of course YTA.", ">I really hoped that my son would like the pup once he sees it and maybe even become friends with her.\n\nSo you discussed all this with his therapist first, right?\nRight?", "Info: how long has your son been at your in-laws and what do you plan to do now?", "YTA. First of all, getting a new puppy that belongs to your daughter, as opposed to a family pet, was high risk anyway. It implies a level of favouritism. \n\nSecondly, you completely dismissed his feelings on the subject, despite the fact that he had to literally get therapy to help cope with his grief. By your own admission your daughter was fine, she could have easily survived a little longer without having a dog. \n\nThirdly, why on earth didn't you use the therapist? Discuss ways to help with the transition. Have him involved in the adoption process etc.  \n\nI don't even know how you begin fixing this one.", "YTA - Your daughter being sad because she wants a dog is not the same thing as your son being traumatized by the loss of a dog.", "NTA", "INFO: does your son have anything else going on other than the grief of losing his beloved dog? this seems like a very extreme reaction, so I wondered if there was another underlying issue that you're not revealing here.", "YTA\n\n> My In Laws are lashing out against my Husband and I for ,,favoring\u201c our daughter and put her wishes over our sons mental health. \n\nYup. He was the one traumatised, not her: you should have prioritised his feelings. He was clear about his feelings but nope, you thought you knew better what he wanted than what he did himself. You did this way too soon. You absolutely favoured her mild sadness over his massive trauma. Trauma he needed *therapy* for. \n\n\nAnd now what. You can't possibly keep it.  Realistically that puppy has to be returned. And what will your daughter do then?\n\n\nShame on you.", "I'm actually gonna go against the grain and say NAH, although it's a borderline case. You definitely should not have surprised him with it, but I don't agree that the entire household needs to wait indefinitely for some ill-defined sense of \"readiness\" from your son before getting another dog. Five months is a pretty big chunk of time.\n\nUnless something is truly pathologically wrong here, I suspect that being around the new dog will ultimately help your son move on, even if he had a strong negative reaction to it upfront. I just don't see a situation happening where he's six months down the line and still unable to function with another dog in the house, and if he is...the dog is the least of your problems at that point.", "Soft YTA for not giving your son enough time to mourn the death of his friend and not considering his feelings. Your daughter is 8 and has plenty of time to get her family dog. You should have waited and then maybe fostered a dog or two to get your son comfortable with having a dog in the house again.", "YTA.  I think you have problems beyond the dog. Your son needs therapy for more than dog grief.   Your son sounds like he\u2019s in crisis for reasons other than the dog.  The dog is a symptom of something going on that you are neglecting.", "YTA. In addition to him not being ready- You all should have gone as a family to choose a new family dog together. Not reveal her as a surprise gift to just your daughter.  You didn\u2019t give your son an opportunity to bond with a dog that would have reminded him of happy memories of his last dog. He needs to learn he can\u2019t avoid the memories of his past friend. He needs to get to a place where he can remember and think of him fondly in a way that brings joy.", "NTA that is the cycle of life. It\u2019s a hard lesson but is reality. It teaches lessons about love, grief, and moving past hard situations to live life fully", "I do not understand all the responses here. \n\nPets die. Was the family never to get another dog bc son loved a pet that died?\n\nAbsolutely freaking out because another puppy exists seems super extreme. \n\nWhat does his therapist say about his \u201ctrauma\u201d from a natural occurrence that is holding the rest of the family hostage?\n\nI don\u2019t understand being traumatized by a pets death, unless it was sudden or horrible?\n\nMy family lost a dog and several cats over the course of my childhood. We cried, we grieved, we memorialized them, we talked about them - still do! But then we moved on with life because pets are only with us for a good time - not a long time. \n\nSo I am grasping to understand your sons reaction.", "Heart was in the right spot but the execution was off.  This should have been a family discussion with clear boundaries and a clear timeline. This would allow your 10m to work through his feelings about it and come to terms with it. This would also demonstrate to your daughter that this is a family pet, not her personal pet. \n\nYou're the parent -- make the boundaries and teach your kids to navigate within them. Set your kids up for emotional success, not failure.", "5 Month? And he had therapy? Please, get a new therapist. This one is clearly not competent. I am always against treating animals like objects - so ESH because you clearly objectified the new dog. Why not tell your son about choosing a new family member together?", "NTA", "Very, very soft YTA. Honestly, I would have made the same mistake, assuming that my son would fall in love with the new innocent puppy. I would not have anticipated that extreme reaction.", "YTA\n\nYour son is not ready for a new dog. He certainly isn't ready for you to gift his sister her very own puppy. \n\nI'm not saying your family can never have another pet. But you went about this all wrong. As others have said you should have A) talked to his therapist, B) had a discussion as a family about a reasonable time line to get a new pet, and C) picked out a new dog as a family instead of giving your daughter her own dog. \n\nNow you're in a worse position than before. If you keep the puppy, your son is going to refuse to come home and he's going to resent his sister. If you take the puppy away, you're going to break your daughter's heart and she's going to resent her brother.", "YTA - the kids in therapy over it you shouldn\u2019t have got a new dog without the go ahead from the therapist simple as.", "NTA.

Five months is NOTHING in the course of grieving for a pet. Your daughter would have been totally fine emotionally not having a dog in the house for a while. Your son, on the other hand, lost his best friend and is in therapy to deal with it. Who do YOU think you should have been more concerned about?\n\nTo compound your thoughtlessness, you presented the puppy at your daughter's birthday party with no warning to you son. You completely blindsided him, going against his direct request for you to not get another dog, and did it in front of a group of people. Of course he was upset.\n\nYour in-laws are correct that you are favoring your daughter.

I don't even know what to tell you to do now. If you give the puppy back your daughter will be upset with you and learn that pets are disposable.

He had spent some time really processing his feelings and was able to acknowledge that even though the hurt was immense while right in the middle of it, he knew that he would still be able to find joy in another pet even if it felt impossible at the moment.

Also by acknowledging and working with him on his feelings, you can help him understand his sisters feelings.  He will likely be more accommodating once he\u2019s had space to feel his big feelings.

I\u2019m saying you should have waited longer. He might have been ready in another 6 months to a year. Now, it\u2019s likely to take twice as long before he is ready again.

Nice work, and after reading some of your comments let me applaud you as mother of the year.  How wonderful of you for not punishing your son for how he reacted after you absolutely betrayed his trust, showed him which child is the favorite, and let him know that you don't care about him or his feelings.
