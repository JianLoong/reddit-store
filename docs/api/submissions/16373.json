Yes, people who keep dogs will usually get another dog when the last one passed, and it's not right for your family for one kid to insist on never getting a pet again. But I think this would have gone better has your son felt he had any say in the decision? If you'd allowed him to express a timeline that he thinks would be best for him? Ect.", "#YTA\n\nHe he's in a very emotional space right now. He's learning how to express his feelings in an \"adult\" way. He's learning how to convert emotions into words that others can understand. He's learning how to cope with a tragically traumatic loss. He's processing his grievance and most importantly, HE HAD TO SEEK THERAPY FOR IT.\n\nAnd you invalidated every single one of his feelings and thoughts by getting a new dog so soon. You should've at the very least included him in the process of looking for, visiting, and adopting the new dog.\n\nYou and your husband are the asshole. Your daughter wouldn't need therapy because she didn't get a new dog. Your son very well might.\n\nAgain, you ARE the asshole here.", "Honestly, I think you handled this situation poorly. Giving one kid the gift of a pet is tricky anyway since you're going to struggle to find your son a comparable present for his birthday, which will no doubt feel like favouritism. That's before you even delve into the minimizing of his trauma.\n\nYou say your son is in therapy. You had a resource there to help ease him into the idea of getting another family dog. YTA.", "YTA you created a big mess unnecessarily. Your son is grieving to the point of needing therapy. Did you not consult the therapist? Your daughter would have been fine with something else for her birthday. A year waiting could have made all the difference to your son. He\u2019ll probably be ready in time for a new dog. Why did you not give him the time he needs? Now you need to fix this but I don\u2019t know how without hurting your daughter!", "My dog passed away and my brother tried to bring me a new one. And truth is, it took me a long time to stop feeling disloyal to my deceased life partner of a dog who'd been with me for more than 10 years. Logic tells me that First dog would never begrudge me loving another dog. But, emotions oftentimes aren't \"logical.\"\n\nSo, on the strength of that, I would have been unwilling to *force* my son to move forward. We only move forward when we are ready after all. NTA. Just trying to divide the baby doesn't make us Solomon. We make inconsiderate and less than strictly fair tradeoffs all the time in an effort to do the best we can\n\nReally hoping your son would love something he said he wasn't ready for is all that happened. It was a disconnect - not murder. But, I definitely get that the puppy sent him over the edge. He's just not \"ready\" to love another dog yet. (Hugs. Being The Mom is Really Hard Sometimes.)", "YTA.\n\n>My Daughter was sad too, but she moved on very quickly. \n\nI suspect that she could have coped well if you hadn't got her a dog.\n\n>Our dog was his best friend.\n\n>He went to therapy to get to terms with it.\n\n>He could not stand the idea and he started developing disdain for his sister for bringing it up all the time.\n\nI would expect him to cope less well if you did get her one.\n\n>we really thought about our Son too.

Your son was SUFFERING. \n\nYou would have been a massive AH just for ignoring that, because it seems that despite the fact that your son was open and communicative about his feelings, you literally did absolutely nothing to validate them, or to help or support him in his very real grief at the loss of a beloved friend.  \n\nBut then you not only treated his grief like it was no big deal and like it should just somehow magically go away . . . you *purposefully chose to do something that he told you would make him feel exponentially worse*. You literally heard him tell you what would feel most traumatic to him while he was trying to take the time to grieve this loss, and thought to yourself, \"You know what would be a smart thing to do? EXACTLY WHAT MY KID SAYS WOULD FEEL MOST PAINFUL TO HIM!\"\n\n> I really hoped that my son would like the pup once he sees it and maybe even become friends with her.\n\nWTF? In what world did that seem to make any sense? Nope. I don't buy it. You weren't thinking about your son at all. You were literally just making shit up in your head to justify ignoring your son's very clear communication about his needs and his grief, to do what made your daughter (and I'm guessing you) happy. What a shitty, shitty thing to do to a suffering child.\n\nYour daughter didn't need a new puppy, she wanted one. And she could have had one eventually, one your son had had time to grieve. But you don't even care enough about him to give him that. What a miserable, hateful example of preferential treatment you've shown here. Your poor son must feel so alone. I don't blame him for not wanting to be anywhere near you. Why would he, when you've shown him that he means nothing to you at all? Of course YTA.", ">I really hoped that my son would like the pup once he sees it and maybe even become friends with her.\n\nSo you discussed all this with his therapist first, right?\nRight?", "Info: how long has your son been at your in-laws and what do you plan to do now?", "YTA. First of all, getting a new puppy that belongs to your daughter, as opposed to a family pet, was high risk anyway. It implies a level of favouritism. \n\nSecondly, you completely dismissed his feelings on the subject, despite the fact that he had to literally get therapy to help cope with his grief. By your own admission your daughter was fine, she could have easily survived a little longer without having a dog. \n\nThirdly, why on earth didn't you use the therapist? Discuss ways to help with the transition. Have him involved in the adoption process etc.  \n\nI don't even know how you begin fixing this one.", "YTA - Your daughter being sad because she wants a dog is not the same thing as your son being traumatized by the loss of a dog.", "NTA", "INFO: does your son have anything else going on other than the grief of losing his beloved dog? this seems like a very extreme reaction, so I wondered if there was another underlying issue that you're not revealing here.", "YTA\n\n> My In Laws are lashing out against my Husband and I for ,,favoring\u201c our daughter and put her wishes over our sons mental health. \n\nYup. He was the one traumatised, not her: you should have prioritised his feelings. He was clear about his feelings but nope, you thought you knew better what he wanted than what he did himself. You did this way too soon. You absolutely favoured her mild sadness over his massive trauma. Trauma he needed *therapy* for. \n\n\nAnd now what. You can't possibly keep it.  Realistically that puppy has to be returned. And what will your daughter do then?\n\n\nShame on you.", "I'm actually gonna go against the grain and say NAH, although it's a borderline case. You definitely should not have surprised him with it, but I don't agree that the entire household needs to wait indefinitely for some ill-defined sense of \"readiness\" from your son before getting another dog. Five months is a pretty big chunk of time.\n\nUnless something is truly pathologically wrong here, I suspect that being around the new dog will ultimately help your son move on, even if he had a strong negative reaction to it upfront. I just don't see a situation happening where he's six months down the line and still unable to function with another dog in the house, and if he is...the dog is the least of your problems at that point.", "Soft YTA for not giving your son enough time to mourn the death of his friend and not considering his feelings. Your daughter is 8 and has plenty of time to get her family dog. You should have waited and then maybe fostered a dog or two to get your son comfortable with having a dog in the house again.", "YTA.  I think you have problems beyond the dog. Your son needs therapy for more than dog grief.   Your son sounds like he\u2019s in crisis for reasons other than the dog.  The dog is a symptom of something going on that you are neglecting.", "YTA. In addition to him not being ready- You all should have gone as a family to choose a new family dog together. Not reveal her as a surprise gift to just your daughter.  You didn\u2019t give your son an opportunity to bond with a dog that would have reminded him of happy memories of his last dog. He needs to learn he can\u2019t avoid the memories of his past friend. He needs to get to a place where he can remember and think of him fondly in a way that brings joy.", "NTA that is the cycle of life. It\u2019s a hard lesson but is reality. It teaches lessons about love, grief, and moving past hard situations to live life fully", "I do not understand all the responses here. \n\nPets die. Was the family never to get another dog bc son loved a pet that died?\n\nAbsolutely freaking out because another puppy exists seems super extreme. \n\nWhat does his therapist say about his \u201ctrauma\u201d from a natural occurrence that is holding the rest of the family hostage?\n\nI don\u2019t understand being traumatized by a pets death, unless it was sudden or horrible?\n\nMy family lost a dog and several cats over the course of my childhood. We cried, we grieved, we memorialized them, we talked about them - still do! But then we moved on with life because pets are only with us for a good time - not a long time. \n\nSo I am grasping to understand your sons reaction.", "Heart was in the right spot but the execution was off.  This should have been a family discussion with clear boundaries and a clear timeline. This would allow your 10m to work through his feelings about it and come to terms with it. This would also demonstrate to your daughter that this is a family pet, not her personal pet. \n\nYou're the parent -- make the boundaries and teach your kids to navigate within them. Set your kids up for emotional success, not failure.", "5 Month? And he had therapy? Please, get a new therapist. This one is clearly not competent.

Why not tell your son about choosing a new family member together?", "NTA", "Very, very soft YTA. Honestly, I would have made the same mistake, assuming that my son would fall in love with the new innocent puppy. I would not have anticipated that extreme reaction.", "YTA\n\nYour son is not ready for a new dog. He certainly isn't ready for you to gift his sister her very own puppy. \n\nI'm not saying your family can never have another pet. But you went about this all wrong. As others have said you should have A) talked to his therapist, B) had a discussion as a family about a reasonable time line to get a new pet, and C) picked out a new dog as a family instead of giving your daughter her own dog. \n\nNow you're in a worse position than before. If you keep the puppy, your son is going to refuse to come home and he's going to resent his sister.

Who do YOU think you should have been more concerned about?\n\nTo compound your thoughtlessness, you presented the puppy at your daughter's birthday party with no warning to you son.

Of course he was upset.\n\nYour in-laws are correct that you are favoring your daughter.

I don't even know what to tell you to do now. If you give the puppy back your daughter will be upset with you and learn that pets are disposable.

If my husband suddenly appeared with a new dog while knowing my feelings I would be hurt.", "As it was a family dog, it absolutely should not have been a birthday gift for your daughter.\n\nYou also absolutely should not have brought a dog/pup into the house without first informing your son. You might overrule his objections, but he had a right to be heard.\n\nYTA", "So despite your son vehemently telling you he did not want another dog, you got one because you figured he\u2019d actually like it and had just what\u2026\u2026.lied about not liking it? YTA. If you want another family dog, fine, get one, but don\u2019t pretend you did it for your son\u2019s happiness.", "YTA - it has ONLY been 5 months AND your son needed therapy over the loss. You either favor your daughter or do not care about your son's feeling or both.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nWould it have been so hard to freaking ADOPT a dog?", "YTA.\n\nNever get a pet unless the whole family is accepting of it.", "Animals are not presents. Do not give animals to people as \"presents\".\n\nAnd get your son back in therapy; he's clearly still dealing with some shit and you aren't helping.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. A family is a unit. We consider everyone in the unit before getting a family pet", "Your not an asshole your a good mom who wants your daughter to have a bond with an animal the way your son did, I think its a harsh lesson but a good one to learn, hes old enough to learn that you cant have everything the way you want it, it seems like \"if i cant have my dog nobody can have one\" kind of thing. Also im very sorry rip Peanut.", "YTA. I'm a grown ass man and when my dog died it was hard enough on me that it took me over a year before I was ready to consider getting another one. At five months it still felt like it had just happened. Your son is grieving and having a harder time than the rest of you and you just told him his emotional needs come second to everyone else in the house. If at five months he is having this kind of a reaction don't get a dog now and wait a few more months and readdress the issue.", "YTA\n\nHealing over the loss of a pet can be different and take different amount of time for people. 5 months isn't enough for many adults let alone a 10 year old. You should have considered the feelings of somebody who is still suffering over your daughter who is over it. Only once everyone in the family was ready should a new dog come to the family. You made a major mistake here....", "Everybody has thoroughly explained how YTA for the way you treated your son in this situation, so I'll ignore that in my comment.\n\nYTA the asshole for this too:\n\n>The Dog as a present for my daughter: A dog does not belong to a single person. A Dog is a Family Member. My Son can love her, play with her, can do anything. We made clear to our daughter, that she is not ,her, dog\n\n\nI understand that pets pretty quickly become \"family pets\" rather than one person's, but then they're not a gift for one person either.\n\nDon't skip giving your child a birthday present just to buy something you wanted for yourself too.", "Even after your edit, dear OP, you still handled this VERY badly.  You knew the pet would upset your son, so stop with the \"we hoped\" crap.  That's a massive cop out.\n\nA FAMILY PET is not \"revealed at someone's birthday\".  \n\nSo no matter what you meant, you dropped a HUGE ball here.  You did not listen to your son.  You deliberately over rode his trauma to make sure your daughter got the pet she desired.  Yes, you absolutely favoured the daughter.  No matter what your intent was.  \n\n100% YTA", "YTA. Your son gave you all the signs that he wasn't ready. And only 3 months in therapy? Why?", "YTA\n\nYou should not have bought a dog until he was in a better place mentally. You are a bad mother and if don't re-home the puppy you could permanently damage your relationship with your son.", "YTA: In order to get a dog, the whole household must be in agreement. You did make the house an uncomfortable environment for your son.", "The poor daughter. She felt a loss, that is why she wanted a new dog. It sounds like the son has bigger issues and would deprive his sister of  the dog she needs for the rest of her childhood. That son needs a lot more therapy, but I get it. OP thought the joy of the moment might change the son's heart. Something is very wrong with the son that needs to be addressed, and either the parents are in denial or there are deeper issues", "YTA", "Also, if son is THIS distraught and insistent on never having another dog *why is he still not in therapy* he clearly needs to be.", "You are top comment and have not added a judgement :) I basically said the same & came up with YTA", "This PLUS the fact that kids around 8 years old just tend to want an animal anyway. OP could've gotten her a guinea pig or something, then the son wouldn't have been belittled & the daughter would still have a pet.\nThe fact that the son was traumatized by the death has me super curious on how the dog died, & if the boy watched whatever happened to his best friend", "Or at least blind to. Reading this makes me think the son may be ND, even if only slightly. Most kids lash out due to tragedy. Most kids will take hard stances like \"no dog will replace my beloved dog!\" and they are right to do so. But most kids with family pets are able to function despite that grief, and come around to new pets fairly quickly. Hell, my family went through a series of shelter dogs while I was 5-12 and all of us were able to cope without therapy (or attentive parents but that was a bigger problem...) \n\nGetting their son therapy was the right move, and given his extreme reaction to the idea of another family pet, they should have involved the therapist in the process. All that being said, it reads like something else is wrong and OP needs to look into what that is for the sake of her son. If he really is ND or not, he clearly needs more help to process strong emotions, especially grief.\n\nNAH.", "OP *did* go through it. The whole family lost the dog. Not just the boy. The parents decided it was time to get a new dog. I don't think animals should ever be surprise gifts, but they can't change that now. The boy needs to be home and learning to handle his grief.", "That\u2019s because they pulled him out of therapy", "Downvoted for saying basically the same thing as quite a few others, Reddit is amazing.", "Exactly, they knew it was a decision he would struggle with and they surprised him with it in public. In doing so they disregarded \\*both\\* of their kids' feelings because 1.) the son was blindsided in front of everyone and felt like his wishes were steamrolled and 2.) the daughter's birthday party was derailed by the son's (entirely predictable) meltdown. This could have been avoided with clear communication within the family unit ahead of time.", "I disagree. If one person in the house doesn\u2019t want to live in a house that has a dog in it, then the house shouldn\u2019t have a dog in it.", "Yeah, he totally learn what only one child in the family matters. I bet he suspected it before. Way to go", "True, but it wasn't necessary or hurting anyone to not get a new dog yet.", "Plus, OP says they got it for her birthday but a dog doesn't belong to one person.  \n\nSo basically OP got themselves a dog and pretended to get a birthday present for their kid.  \n\nSo the kid didn't actually get a birthday present.", "What if he doesn\u2019t want to go back? Is he expected to take care of the dog?", "That would just be cruel on the Guinea pig. Small pets need care too and getting a small animal as a substitute for a dog or will most likely end up in a kid that loses interest once the novelty wears off or a new dog is adopted", "> but the sisters dog, after all it was her birthday present\n\nOP has said the dog doesn't belong to one person.  \n\nSo basically they got themselves a family dog so they wouldn't have to get the daughter a gift.", "When our cat, who had been adopted right before our first son was born, died a few years ago he was sad.\n\nThe cat and him were best friends and grew up together. She was his cat and he was her person.  When she passed we were all sad but my son was absolutely gutted.\n\nTwo weeks later he asked if he could rescue a cat from the shelter and of course we said yes.\n\nAnd now Miss Penelope Kitterton lives with us, she's fond of all of us, but she's always with him when he gets home from school or work.\n\nPets die, it's part of owning pets.", "Getting the son therapy is definitely not a case of \"\"Tough s**t, suck it up.\"\" That the son is outwardly demonstrating his grief where the daughter is not also doesn't mean he is suffering more than the daughter. I'm certain you've seen how vocal people can be about discomfort compared to how silent others can be about life-halting suffering. It's also critical to teach a child how to handle change. \n\nThere is a lot of nuance here and it sounds like OP was trying to help and consider both kids.", "Everyone\u2019s experience with grief is different. They didn\u2019t understand or go through the exact same thing their son did, they had their own experience of it. They went through the same tragedy, not the same reaction, clearly. I would even say their experience of the loss were different since they are different people with different levels of emotional tolerance \n\nI will say again, everyone deals with grief and loss differently. My whole family lost my dog as well yet I had a different experience than them, since it took me much longer to get better. \n\nThey did not understand what he was feeling. Instead of trying to understand, they went against his wishes and got another dog when he was not ready. Not everyone mourns the same way. He needed more time. Not everyone heals at the same rate or in the same way. Meaning, the new dog helped his sister but would not help him. People are different and have different needs", "Well I mean, by not taking his feelings into account they told him he\u2019s not a valued member of the household and his feelings don\u2019t count.", "Plus giving it as a present to the sister makes it seem like it\u2019s her dog and not his. They went about this terribly", "Why why should everybody have to suffer for one person's unreasonable demand?", "Yeah, my friend is a therapist and deals with parents like this all the time.", "I don't think 5 months is quickly. When my last cat passed away I went and got a new one within a month. Everybody's different.", "One 10 year olds unreasonable demand*", "My biggest issue is not even the dog but how in the world did you ever decide that surprising him when he's repeatedly told you how he feels was a good idea? Like what did you expect would happen? I saw you said you won't punish him for his outburst... well of course not. It was entirely your fault. There a billion ways you could have gone about this and you landed on the worst one possible?", "I think they were being sarcastic.", "As a child therapist, unfortunately, it doesn't surprise me at all.", "You're kidding, right? The son is obviously the one in greater distress. He is in therapy. He vehemently and repeatedly said that getting a new dog would be upsetting for him. The parents got a new dog without even broaching the subject with his therapist. Unless other evidence is presented by OP, the new dog for the daughter was a would be nice to lift her spirits thing versus a definite no from the son's perspective. I think you're wrong and we will have to just disagree", "So you do something that would definitely greatly upset the son to alleviate the daughter's possible suffering? No. They obviously favor the daughter if since they sprung it on the son without even consulting his therapist. It is naked favoritism.", "Agreed he's probably just happy to have a home and doesn't even know that's he's the main topic of argument \ud83d\ude2d", "He's ten and his dog died, this is not \"undue trauma\"", "YTA What a joke. You obviously do not care for your son, let him stay with his grandparents. \n\nAll your replies are 'ME, ME, ME, ME'.", "i feel so sorry for your son. he\u2019s so young and has to deal with this for years, unless his grandparents take him in. mom of the year goes to you /s. seriously op, yta. i hope you reflect on this or else your relationship with your son will be damaged as he grows older.", "Not punishing him for this is the BARE MINIMUM. He had a mental breakdown, why on earth would punishing him even be considered?", "No, he's ten and grieving and being forced into a situation he has zero control over because mommy favours little sister and little sister wanted a new dog before everyone in the family was ready. Isn't the thing with dogs that always gets said on this sub is that they're a \"two yes, one no means no\" scenario? His input is just as important on the dog situation because no matter how you spin it, *he has to live with it*. He appropriately communicated a boundary and had it completely torn away from him because they expected him to just get over it.", "Something like that, it just has to be. Poor little guy.", "Making him live with the dog he\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not ready for is punishing him though!", "I'm not saying this situation isn't hard or that it won't suck for the kid but it's still not \"undue trauma.\" He was outvoted by the rest of the family and isn't going to be responsible for the dog. An unideal situation is not undue trauma, it's just life.", "Okay, so unlike every other post in this subreddit, it's fine when she does not take the one no as a no? It's fine that she ignores her son's grief in favour of her daughter? It's fine that he told her he was still in mourning only for her to say that that doesn't matter because the baby gets what the baby wants?\n\nNo. No it is *not*. And yes, it is absolutely traumatizing to a child. If she wants a good relationship with her son, she will apologize, find another home for the dog, and then, and ***only then***, will she ask if she is ready to come home. OP is 100% the AH in this scenario. Just like any other time someone forces a pet on another family member. It doesn't matter if he doesn't have to do anything with it, because he still has to live with said dog and be reminded of the family member he lost.", "*Hes 10*", "I mean\u2026.as parents we make our children miserable all the time. We make them brush their teeth, eat their vegetables, do their homework, take out the trash. What my children want and need are always factored in, BUT they are not the decision makers. My kids would be absolutely miserable if we had to move, but I can\u2019t rule that out just because they\u2019d be miserable, there are other factors at play. Parents make decisions on what they feel are best for their entire family all the time. OP didn\u2019t run out and get a new dog the second her daughter asked for one. They waited, they got their son therapy. It doesn\u2019t sound like her son is remotely open to a new family pet anytime in the foreseeable future. So where does that leave her and the rest of the fam? \n\nOP\u2019s execution wasn\u2019t great, but getting a new family pet 5 months later doesn\u2019t make them a shitty parent.", "I don't know how to explain this to you, but ten year olds are still real people."]}
