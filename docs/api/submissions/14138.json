She should line up a job before quiting her present job. If she lived on her own, this would be her reality. Welcome to grown up", "What I\u2019m guessing will be an unpopular opinion: NTA \n\nSpecifically because she won\u2019t see someone about her anxiety that literally causes her to be unable to go to work and function properly. Hating a job and physically making yourself too ill to go are very different things.", "NTA. She clearly has a problem she needs to address, and instead of addressing it, she just wants to keep skipping work and making you pay for it.", "NTA. Living together is like a trial run for long term commitment together, whether marriage or just wanting to spend your lives together. Even being generous and assuming \"over a year\" means closer to two years she's spent a lot of it unable to work and refusing to do anything to help her uphold her side of the commitment.\n\nIf she was seeking help it would be different, we support loved ones who are doing their best. She is refusing to do anything to try to improve her medical situation and just expects you to cover for her. I'd say this is a trial that shows how your life will be if you stay with her - when things get hard for her she wants you to pick up the pieces. Presumably she managed to pay her bills before she had you to step in. It's up to you if that's something you can accept and if not a breakup now rather than dragging the relationship through resentment and acrimony is best.", "You are NTA. She needs to seek help if it is affecting her like this--she is responsible for her actions despite her illness. If she isn't trying to manage it then it that shouldn't fall on you. If she was doing everything she could and still couldn't manage, that'd be a different story.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t let her work you. Next year she\u2019ll have a meltdown and ask you to pay 100%, and then she\u2019ll want to get married and divorced and have you on the hook for life.\n\nThe tell is that she is withholding her savings.", "Oof NTA. I wasn\u2019t sure up until you said she refuses to get help or treatment for her anxiety which is now affecting her ability to hold multiple jobs. She needs to see a doctor or therapist.", "NTA.  You are correct in that she has an anxiety issue.  If she agreed to get help for it I might think differently but as it sits, since she refuses, the rent should stay as it is, 50/50.", "NTA - she is refusing treatment for a known issue, besides which she took advantage of your agreement the first time. One month is generous and supportive on your part; to ask for more is too far on her part.", "NTA\n\nAlso, think long and hard about where this relationship is going. If you marry and she decides not to work - what then? If you have a child and she says she wants to stay home - what then?\n\nThrowing up her hands and saying \"I'm quitting\" and using you as the financial backstop, rather than taking responsibility for her mental health, is an issue worth looking into.", "NTA. You can't help so.body who refuses to help themselves.", "NTA. You had an agreement and were willing to bend a little to help, but it seems like she's trying to take advantage of that.  Things might be different if she was taking steps to address her issues, but she's not. Keep in mind though, this is probably the first step to the end of the relationship, for good or bad.", "I'm going to say NTA because she isn't addressing that her meds aren't working for her. I've gone through similar, and it took time to get the right meds/dosage that worked for me. She needs to be willing to work on it or else she will never settle in a job. \n\nWithout knowing other details like the length of the relationship, I think you each need to discuss your expectations for the future and how finances will be dealt with.", "NTA - and good for you for putting your foot down.  what if she was single?  how would she address this issue?  relationships can be good because a partner can step in and help a situation, but that should 100% be temporary (which already happened) otherwise it can start to be abused - which it sounds like your gf is doing now.", "NTA, maybe she should ask the landlord and utilities companies if you can only pay 75% of the bills instead of expecting for you to take over the cost", "NTA, she act like a child. She need to take her responsability.", "NTA - It sounds like she\u2019s taking advantage of you and this will only escalate the longer youre together.", "nta\n\nmental health issues arent her fault but her responsibility and its high time she gets help or looks for a less stressful job. it was nice that you helped her out that one time but she cant make it a habbit. what if she was single? who would she mooch off of then? her parents? dont let her take advantage of you, thats not fair.", "NTA, but she might come to resent you. What you should think about is income disparity (yes I know you mentioned your incomes are similar but similar is a broad term) and whether that is fairly split, AND who is doing more of the household stuff or taking care of pets. Ideally you want to sit her down and talk to her about her seeing a therapist, not because you want her bringing more money in, but rather because you love her and want her to get better. Maybe even review how you both feel supported in the relationship. Your stance is a bit more like a roommate's rather than a loving partner's. What if something happens to you and you cannot pay? She will have the same right to refuse to cover the bills and she won't be TA either, but you know where I'm going with this.", "What are your incomes/income to rent ratios?\n\nNTA regardless, since she refuses to get help for herself.", "INFO - how much do each of you earn", "NTA - but are you prepared to pitch in more if she does get help? Getting help can be intense. Med changes can be awful (I was suicidal due to a med change last year). It doesn't fix things in the blink of an eye.\n\nIf you aren't prepared for this, go your separate ways. \n\nRelationships aren't always 50/50. Over the course of a relationship you are going to be 80/20. 100/0. 150/0.  25/75. 10/90. Etc.\n\nI don't think this is about the money.", "Bwah a difficult one, as it is complex. Would say NTA, but can be handeled differntly. GF need to get therapy , jus tmedicaitons alone will never be enough - that usually means lifelong (ab)use of medication and addiciton.  We always paid equal amount into the joint account (f.e. 50%, 75%)  which was used for all joint expenses - so if I earn more I pay more but equally in %.  But this is secondary.  Get your GF get therapy and off antidepressant under medical oversight, anxiety is not treated by antidepressant medications.  You can say you will pay bit more if she gets treatment / therapy?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What if she just refuses to pay? Is this a deal-breaker in your relationship? Can you break your lease? \n\n I think you agree that if she seeks help, you will help cover part of the expenses until she\u2019s stabilized. You also need to talk about the plan if she takes years to stabilize, or never does. \n\nAnd I think you need to lay out what will you do if she does not seek help.\n\nI would also be open-minded. She could\u2019ve jumped from one horrible job into another one that\u2019s just showing it\u2019s true colors. Or she may no longer be able to work in whatever industry because it makes her crazy. If you both agree that changing jobs/industries/working hours/etc has a good shot of resolving the problem, you pursue that instead of psychological help.\n\nAnd the key is to be gentle, firm, and clear. \u201cI need a partner I can trust to manage their health and wellness.
