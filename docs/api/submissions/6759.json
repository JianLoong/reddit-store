All the guest were required to get them gifts either before hand on the registry.. or upon arrival. I went to the wedding registry and they had a lot of expensive things, the cheapest being around 150. \n\nMy husband and I are very well off and his cousin is aware. His cousin and I were also friends for about 10 years so & I know she\u2019s into the finer things.\n\nThe wedding was mid December & when we arrived she asked us why we didn\u2019t buy anything from the registry when everyone else did & why we had such a small box in our hand before greeting us. I was taken aback. I told her we had something special for her & she would appreciate it far more than the material things we saw on the registry. She laughed & said it was funny how we probably had the most money but decided to be cheap assholes. She made a scene and it was hella awkward. \n\nIn the little box was a letter & an envelope with a 15k check to help her and her now husband on their infertility issue. They have been trying for years & were informed the treatment would be around 10k, my husband and I paid it together because we knew how much that would mean a lot to her, plus it was well in our budget. We added the extra 5k just to make life a little easier because we know they\u2019ve been struggling financially since the pandemic. \n\nAnywho, after causing the scene, she ripped the box out of my hand and left. My husband and I walked out & I quickly cancelled the check. \n\nAfter realizing what was in the box, she apologized for embarrassing us and kicking us out via text & when she tried to deposit it, it obviously didn\u2019t work. She has been blowing up our phones saying how awful we are & how we are taking away her dream to start a family. \n\nAlthough some people say we aren\u2019t assholes & she isn\u2019t entitled to our money, others say we are & need to give it back to her because we can afford too while they can\u2019t. Saying we are rubbing our wealth in her face (WHICH ISN\u2019T TRUE) We have always been very generous to her. \n\nAlthough I feel bad, I\u2019m disgusted by her reaction & refuse to have a relationship with someone who is clearly in our lives for our money.  \n\nHere is where I might be the AH though \u2026.. I can be a little Petty, so I donated about the same amount of money to a charity helping with girls education around the world & posted about it on Facebook.. my husband also shared my post (we have pettiness in common) lol she\u2019s pissed & so is my husbands family.", "created_utc": 1673134058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106330q/aita_for_stopping_payment_on_a_large_check_i/", "score": 3829, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was nothing humbling or gracious about her response when you gave the gift and only wanted to clean things up after she saw in the box. To make matters worst , it comes off insincere since she actually texted you and not even picked up the phone to call you. To also make a scene in front of everyone, I'm surprised the family was not more on your side but it seems even the rest of the family look at you two as THE money bank. Don't feel bad for trying.
