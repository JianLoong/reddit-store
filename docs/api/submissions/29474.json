It\u2019s a primarily male dominated company and one of my coworkers (~58M and married) kind of latched on to me from the beginning. It was always civil but there were always red flags. Looming around my desk, showing me nonsense on his phone, pulling a chair up far too close to comfort next to me, etc. Up until this year it\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve just let roll off my shoulders. \n\nWell this year things amplified. I caught him screenshotting my Snapchat stories that were pictures of myself. (The fact that I had reluctantly added him on Snapchat to be \u201cnice\u201d is a whole other mistake/story). After this happened I permanently blocked him. Notified my manager, manager talked to employee, problem solved. I stopped seeing him, he stopped contacting me. \n\nFast forward a few months and he\u2019s trying to talk to me more at work (about work). Transactional, easy. Well old habits die hard and then he started doing the same \u201cshow me shit on his phone and sit too close\u201d blah blah blah. \n\nI\u2019d been planning my wedding and I was very selective with who I invited from work. Obviously excluding this specific employee and a few other people that I just don\u2019t interact with enough to warrant an invite. Flash forward to a few weeks before the wedding, and said coworker approaches me and says \u201cdo I have to wear a tie to your wedding?\u201d I panic and say \u201cthere\u2019s no dress code.\u201d And ended the conversation there. He was not sent a save the date, was not sent an invite, and obviously did not RSVP. \n\nMy closest coworkers (that were invited to the wedding) were made aware of the comment and we all hoped it was just a joke. Well lo and behold one of my coworkers had their invite at their desk for about a month, which obviously had all of the wedding details on it (presumably where the not-invited coworker got him information). \n\nCome to wedding day. Everything is great. We\u2019re finished with dinner and just about to start the cake cutting and the not-invited coworker approaches me and my now husband and says \u201csorry I\u2019m late, I ran into some snags today.\u201d This man does not have his spouse with him, and he (should have at least) clearly felt that there was some serious tension. Flash forward to the dollar dance - this not-invited coworker hops in line and I\u2019m able to escape before I\u2019m forced to dance with this person. By the time I came back one of my other coworkers had escorted him out of the event (apparently it wasn\u2019t a great situation getting him out). \n\nMy manager is aware of the situation (as they were present at the wedding), but I\u2019m just shaken up. I don\u2019t know if this person is just brain dead or really creepy. A part of me feels bad but another part of me says I don\u2019t need to put myself in uncomfortable situations, especially at my own wedding.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698035659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ec8q9/aita_for_having_an_unwanted_and_notinvited/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the type who is so delusional he convinces himself that it\u2019s wanted and reciprocated but she \u201chas to pretend otherwise\u201d for whatever convoluted reason his brain conjures.
