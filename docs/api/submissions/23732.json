My dad was a terrible person and lived in our house but did absolutely nothing to contribute to the family. Me being the oldest, did everything from shopping (at 10 years old!!) to taking care of my siblings. I have always looked forward to the day I can leave and have my own life because it was always just too much for me. I became bitter and depressed at a young age and I feel like I had built up resentment towards my family, mainly my dad. Eventually my parents divorced but they left my single mother with 6 kids and I would have to do even more as I got into my teens. \n\nMy mum has been having health issues recently- she had cancer which was successfully treated and she has a brain tumour. The tumour has been there for about 20 years according to the neurosurgeons. She has seizures and debilitating migraines as a result of it. The only treatment option available is surgery and my mum is refusing it. Now I love my mum so much but there\u2019s only so much I can take. I understand how hard it is for someone to make a decision like this. Brain surgery is a big deal for everyone, I get that. But it\u2019s been almost 2 years since diagnosis and she\u2019s still not wanting surgery even though the complications are getting worse. My mum moved abroad to be with my dad when they got married and so we have no family here. \n\nI have no one to help me and my mental health has been suffering for the past 2 years. I don\u2019t know what to do I feel trapped in a life I don\u2019t want. I know it isn\u2019t my mums fault but it\u2019s exhausting having to be a mother to kids I didn\u2019t have for all my life. I should be enjoying my twenties and living my own life but I\u2019m stuck here with my sick mother and young siblings. I have wanted to leave for years but my mum kept telling me she needed me so I stayed. I was planning to move out in September (planned it in 2021 before mums diagnosis) but since then my mums health has deteriorated. I feel so bad because deep down I still want to leave but I know I can\u2019t. My family will have no one and I won\u2019t be able to forgive myself. I feel like my whole life has passed by and I haven\u2019t been able to enjoy it. Will I be the asshole for leaving?\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to add more context about my parents. Firstly, my mum was 17 when she got married to my dad who was 29. They had me at 18 and 30. I feel like my mum was just naive and made dumb decisions. He made false promises and she didn\u2019t see through his bs. She\u2019s never been an independent kind of person - never finished school, didn\u2019t go to uni, has never had a job and she\u2019s never learned to drive. She\u2019s always relied on people which is terrible, I know but I think she just assumed he was going to take care of her and he didnt. She tried to make it work time and time again but eventually gave up since he wasn\u2019t changing. They\u2019ve been divorced for over 10 years and we haven\u2019t heard from my dad. He doesn\u2019t check up on us or anything so there\u2019s no hope of him helping out.", "created_utc": 1690984508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g9ke0/aita_for_wanting_to_move_away_from_my_sick_mum/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It never was, and I'm so sorry that you were forced into that position.\n\nI am assuming that you are in North America based on your language usage (please correct me if I am wrong) - probably the U.S. - and while the U.S. may be crappy when it comes to healthcare for a lot of things, the truth is that in many cases people actually miss out on supports that DO exist and that they can and should be accessing, either because they are unaware of them, are unaware of how to access them, or because they have some strange, prideful idea that it is shameful to rely on \"the government\" for help . . . but at the same time are only too willing to turn their own children or family members into indentured servants unnecessarily. Honestly, I'm Canadian and after spending time talking to friends who work in social services in the U.S., y'all actually have BETTER supports in some cases - even in small towns, not just big cities - than we do in our supposed \"social safety net\".\n\nIf you feel responsible at all or WANT to help out, do some Googling or make a few phone calls to your local Social Services agencies (hint: if you're not sure where to start, even religious ones like Jewish Family Services or Catholic Family Services will help ANYONE because they get government funds and cannot turn anyone away, no matter if they are religious or not), and ask about \"personal support workers\" or \"in-home support\" for your mum. She is likely entitled to have someone come in and help her with household stuff for several hours a week - cleaning, cooking, whatever she would normally ask you to do.\n\nEven if you choose to just walk away from the situation, though, you are NTA.

My mothers tumors kept coming back and were very aggressive. She slowly became paralyzed on one side.

How old is the next oldest after you? I\u2019d speak to your siblings and formulate a plan to get everyone out. I\u2019d tell mom you aren\u2019t going to do this anymore and that she needs to take responsibility for her life and quit ruining everyone else\u2019s because when she does die it\u2019s going to be a ridiculous burden and so very hard on everyone. It\u2019s beyond unfair for her to do this to all of you. You do have to get out.

I didn't really inderstand what codependency really was until my therapist explained it. (though it was being needy and unable to be independent but it's really more like not being able to have independant emotions from the emotions and situations with others). You may feel responsible for a lot of things that your'e not responsible for. A biggest part of that was realizing I felt hyperaware of others emotional states and like I needed to do something about them yet never let myself take up space myself. Being mature for my age always sounded like a compliment  but in retrospect it was a warning sign that I was no longer a child when I was supposed to be one. I feel like an AH for not wanting to be there for my sick dad but it's his chronic physical and mental illnesses that resulted in my parentification so there is resentment and fatigue of playing that role now that I'm an adult.

You're still young and have a lot of life to live, you just have to decide if you're going to live your life for other people or for yourself.
