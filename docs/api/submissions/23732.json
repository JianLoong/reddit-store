My dad was a terrible person and lived in our house but did absolutely nothing to contribute to the family. Me being the oldest, did everything from shopping (at 10 years old!!) to taking care of my siblings. I have always looked forward to the day I can leave and have my own life because it was always just too much for me. I became bitter and depressed at a young age and I feel like I had built up resentment towards my family, mainly my dad. Eventually my parents divorced but they left my single mother with 6 kids and I would have to do even more as I got into my teens. \n\nMy mum has been having health issues recently- she had cancer which was successfully treated and she has a brain tumour. The tumour has been there for about 20 years according to the neurosurgeons. She has seizures and debilitating migraines as a result of it. The only treatment option available is surgery and my mum is refusing it. Now I love my mum so much but there\u2019s only so much I can take. I understand how hard it is for someone to make a decision like this. Brain surgery is a big deal for everyone, I get that. But it\u2019s been almost 2 years since diagnosis and she\u2019s still not wanting surgery even though the complications are getting worse. My mum moved abroad to be with my dad when they got married and so we have no family here. \n\nI have no one to help me and my mental health has been suffering for the past 2 years. I don\u2019t know what to do I feel trapped in a life I don\u2019t want. I know it isn\u2019t my mums fault but it\u2019s exhausting having to be a mother to kids I didn\u2019t have for all my life. I should be enjoying my twenties and living my own life but I\u2019m stuck here with my sick mother and young siblings. I have wanted to leave for years but my mum kept telling me she needed me so I stayed. I was planning to move out in September (planned it in 2021 before mums diagnosis) but since then my mums health has deteriorated. I feel so bad because deep down I still want to leave but I know I can\u2019t. My family will have no one and I won\u2019t be able to forgive myself. I feel like my whole life has passed by and I haven\u2019t been able to enjoy it. Will I be the asshole for leaving?\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to add more context about my parents. Firstly, my mum was 17 when she got married to my dad who was 29. They had me at 18 and 30. I feel like my mum was just naive and made dumb decisions. He made false promises and she didn\u2019t see through his bs. She\u2019s never been an independent kind of person - never finished school, didn\u2019t go to uni, has never had a job and she\u2019s never learned to drive. She\u2019s always relied on people which is terrible, I know but I think she just assumed he was going to take care of her and he didnt. She tried to make it work time and time again but eventually gave up since he wasn\u2019t changing. They\u2019ve been divorced for over 10 years and we haven\u2019t heard from my dad. He doesn\u2019t check up on us or anything so there\u2019s no hope of him helping out.", "created_utc": 1690984508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g9ke0/aita_for_wanting_to_move_away_from_my_sick_mum/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t ask to be here, nor for your parents to continue procreating (despite your dad being a deadbeat). It\u2019s frankly extremely selfish of them to expect you to raise your siblings for them. You were essentially robbed of a childhood.

By outright refusing the surgery, she\u2019s communicating that she\u2019s not willing to make any sacrifices or take any risks on her end. She would rather continue relying on you. Yes, she\u2019s sick, but the shameless guilt trip she gave you when you finally could leave was not okay. \n\nUltimately, we don\u2019t owe our parents eternal caregiving. It sounds harsh, but you have to try to alleviate yourself of the guilt and finally live your life. When you leave, maybe your dad will finally be forced to not be useless.", "NTA.

I\u2019m the oldest daughter as well and raised my younger brother starting from the age of 5 and both parents were present just crappy addicts and lazy parents. \n\nIt\u2019s called Parentification. Not your kids, not your problem. Do NOT let her trap you with your siblings during your young adulthood. I\u2019m (23F) a mom of 2 and I love them to death but trust me when I say you do not want this. I was given time to heal as I moved out of my mom\u2019s and into my dad\u2019s at 13. You have not had time to heal and the resentment will fester.\n\nRun.

It never was, and I'm so sorry that you were forced into that position.\n\nI am assuming that you are in North America based on your language usage (please correct me if I am wrong) - probably the U.S. - and while the U.S. may be crappy when it comes to healthcare for a lot of things, the truth is that in many cases people actually miss out on supports that DO exist and that they can and should be accessing, either because they are unaware of them, are unaware of how to access them, or because they have some strange, prideful idea that it is shameful to rely on \"the government\" for help . . . but at the same time are only too willing to turn their own children or family members into indentured servants unnecessarily. Honestly, I'm Canadian and after spending time talking to friends who work in social services in the U.S., y'all actually have BETTER supports in some cases - even in small towns, not just big cities - than we do in our supposed \"social safety net\".\n\nIf you feel responsible at all or WANT to help out, do some Googling or make a few phone calls to your local Social Services agencies (hint: if you're not sure where to start, even religious ones like Jewish Family Services or Catholic Family Services will help ANYONE because they get government funds and cannot turn anyone away, no matter if they are religious or not), and ask about \"personal support workers\" or \"in-home support\" for your mum. She is likely entitled to have someone come in and help her with household stuff for several hours a week - cleaning, cooking, whatever she would normally ask you to do.\n\nEven if you choose to just walk away from the situation, though, you are NTA. She can Google, or your dad can. None of this is your responsibility!! I promise.", "I\u2019ve dealt w two people that had brain surgery. My mom who died 2 urs ago and my ex. Had she had the tumor removed she may have been fine. Without the surgery she will slowly lose motor and mental function and eventually have to be in a facility. My mothers tumors kept coming back and were very aggressive. She slowly became paralyzed on one side. The began to for how to do simple things like dial on a phone and couldn\u2019t remember what happened a few moments before. It was horrible. My ex had the seizures. How old is the youngest sibling? How old is the next oldest after you? I\u2019d speak to your siblings and formulate a plan to get everyone out. I\u2019d tell mom you aren\u2019t going to do this anymore and that she needs to take responsibility for her life and quit ruining everyone else\u2019s because when she does die it\u2019s going to be a ridiculous burden and so very hard on everyone. It\u2019s beyond unfair for her to do this to all of you. You do have to get out. I\u2019m not saying that your siblings are your responsibility but seems you should team up w the oldest to begin building new lives to be in a better position to all care for yourselves", "NTA. As the oldest daughter nothing made me more angry than when I had to play the 'third parent' for siblings, including my brother who is a year older. But I had the responsibility of making dinner and helping with homework and making sure chores were done, etc. As I got into my teens, I told my parents that I will do my chores and help with dinner and all that but I DO NOT HAVE KIDS. I know it's terrible and you're in a tough spot but your siblings are not your responsibility and your mother, and father, need to get their shit together. THEY had six kids and they better get their ducks in order because those lives are their responsibility.", "Info: how old are your siblings? \n\nI get that it\u2019s unfair to you but right now your siblings only have you.

Thanks for the advice, I know my dad will never step up he\u2019s become even worse than before.

My mum was super young when she got married (17) and my dad was 12 years older than her (29). She\u2019s always wanted a big family because she came from one but she was the youngest so I can see why she didn\u2019t know how hard it would be. She\u2019s had a hard life so I\u2019ve always put up with it and helped her, even when she doesn\u2019t ask me to.

I was always told how mature I was for my age and now I feel like I\u2019m super childish for wanting to do certain things but it\u2019s just because I didnt get to experience it as a child! Thanks for your response, I appreciate it :)", "Thank you for your response and I\u2019m incredibly sorry about your situation, I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be to constantly be in pain. We live in the UK so even better than the US in terms of healthcare. It\u2019s free here and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way to get my mum a carer or something similar but she\u2019d hate it. She\u2019s quite prideful and doesn\u2019t even tell her friends how she\u2019s suffering so I can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019d think if I say I\u2019ll get you a carer! My mum is very close with her siblings and extended family but they all live abroad, I\u2019d love for her to move closer to them for support but she\u2019s being treated here and can\u2019t leave until she\u2019s healthier unfortunately.\n\nEdit - spelling.", "You should check out therapy options. That is not normal or healthy", "That crippling empathy could be a result of the parentification called codependency & people-pleasing. I didn't really inderstand what codependency really was until my therapist explained it. (though it was being needy and unable to be independent but it's really more like not being able to have independant emotions from the emotions and situations with others). You may feel responsible for a lot of things that your'e not responsible for. A biggest part of that was realizing I felt hyperaware of others emotional states and like I needed to do something about them yet never let myself take up space myself. Being mature for my age always sounded like a compliment  but in retrospect it was a warning sign that I was no longer a child when I was supposed to be one. I feel like an AH for not wanting to be there for my sick dad but it's his chronic physical and mental illnesses that resulted in my parentification so there is resentment and fatigue of playing that role now that I'm an adult. I really hope you get the freedom and fulfillment you are looking for in life! NTA"]}
