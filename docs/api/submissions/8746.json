{"id": 8746, "submission_id": "10pjdxo", "title": "AITA for telling a friend \"no\" when they invited themselves over?", "selftext": "Background: During 2020, a co-worker was really struggling, so I checked on them and their mental health with messages or lunch over zoom. Naturally, we built a nice friendship. I consider them a pretty good friend. We have helped each other out with home-owner tasks, gotten together for a coffee or a walk, exchanged check-ins/conversations over a messenger. Things you do with friends!  \n\n\nSadly, this friend has divorced - suddenly and unexpectedly - in the last year and frequently feels left out, dumped by other friends, and isolated. They have leaned on our friendship a lot and I've been happy to be supportive and offer a sounding board because they truly got dealt a raw deal. This friend is encouraged to always reach out if they're spiraling down in depression and hopefully lifted when they do.  \n\n\nHowever, let's throw a wrench in: friend has previously admitted to having a crush on me and tends to make sarcastic comments alluding to it (\"Well, I can't have what I want, I shouldn't say/do this but I will, I shouldn't hug you but I will...\") This was IMMEDIATELY shut down as a non-possibility EVER and if the friendship was valued, there were boundaries. Thankfully, my own spouse is very understanding, empathetic to this person, likes them as a person - and trusts me. There are no problems with the friendship and it is not a stressor in our own marriage.  \n\n\nFriend regularly asks to see me; I try to limit it because I don't believe it's entirely healthy for them. They need to move on with things that they can't fix or have, though sometimes it's challenging, and I feel mean. But, they stay for hours, well past the dinner, game, or whatever time - hovering, hanging around, awkwardly, even when the typical social cues (cleaning up, moving toward the door, mentioning how late it is, etc.) have been given. It has created some time issues that have made me pull back even more because yo, have a family, career and a to-do list a mile long.   \n\n\nI want to nurture relationships, support friends, but 6 hours or longer is ridiculous. They've figured out how to cleverly make plans so that I feel bad if I say \"no\" with manipulative \"Do you have any time for me?\" type wording. The latest, with NFL season, is inviting themselves over with, \"Is there any way I can come watch the game at your house?\" and \"So \\[dog\\] and I are watching the game at your house next weekend?\" I felt I needed to set a boundary and the last request I denied (at least for now), saying that I could not agree to host them; I had too many deadlines. We have some plans coming up in a couple of weeks that we'd already established, though! I got a two-word, hurt response.  \n\n\nAITA since I've encouraged them to reach out when they need to? I know boundaries are necessary for myself/my family and reaching out for support does not necessarily mean that you come up with reasons to stop by or invite yourself into someone's home for hours when there are numerous ways to connect.", "created_utc": 1675125891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pjdxo/aita_for_telling_a_friend_no_when_they_invited/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a good grasp on the dangers associated with this relationship.  Clearly he is overly interested in you, who are happily married.  You are correct to erect some additional boundaries so he will re-direct his attentions.", "NTA. You are allowed to say no. And \"too much going on right now\" is a fine reason to be firm with your boundary.\n\nYou should also learn to do more than hint when friend has overstayed their welcome: tell them how much time you have when you set the plan, then remind them (the same way you might end a phone call - *well, this has been great, but I've got a bunch of things I need to do now, so I'm going to have to say goodbye*. Get up, get their coat, and open the door for them.", "NTA This person isn't a friend. You're right to call them manipulative. Don't fall for it. Just because you've encouraged them to reach out when they need to doesn't mean that they have the right to overstay their welcome, make comments that make you uncomfortable, or trample your boundaries. You can, and probably should, rescind your invitation for them to reach out to you. They're taking advantage.", "NTA. Set those boundaries and set them *strong*. You were really nice to support your friend/co-worker, but they\u2019re becoming increasingly codependent and inappropriate. Add in that they clearly feel comfortable mentioning their attraction to someone who is a) married and b) clearly not interested and you have the potential for a huge mess there.", "NTA.  Start telling this person NO immediately.  You don't have to give a reason.  If they complain about their mental health, tell them that they need to see a professional as you are not a qualified therapist.  Tell them this every time they bring up their mental health.\n\nThis person is manipulative and not a friend.  Tell your husband how your feeling taken advantage of so he knows to tell this person NO in case they start contacting him for invititations.\n\nRemember:  NO  NO  NO...become a broken record.", "NTA. You have no reason to feel guilt over setting boundaries. This person is leaning too much on you to the point that it sounds a bit unhealthy. I have family like this. They think it's no big deal to try to invite themselves over, or to stay past what an average person would probably consider a normal time. When they've asked to come over I've found myself saying \"I have a lot going on right now, it would be better that you just wait until I let you know when I'm up for having people over. Thanks for understanding\" and if they *are* coming over, the invite is usually something like \"Hey, would you like to come over for dinner? We are free in the evening, but I will have to ask you to be out by 9pm because we have an early morning the next day\"", "Nta. This person has stepped over the line. Then making jokes about it doesn't make it funny. You may have to be firm and direct about it since they haven't respected your boundaries so far.", "NTA. Boundaries are important. Sounds like they\u2019re hanging on and possibly using you for emotional intimacy/support. If I had to hazard a guess, your co-worker maybe be continuing to imagine there\u2019s a chance that you\u2019ll want a relationship, even though you made it clear there isn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nSet boundaries and enforce consequences.", "NTA. It\u2019s sounds like you\u2019ve set boundaries and know exactly what you need to do. You are just feeling guilty for doing that due to your friend manipulating you. \nYou are getting good advice on here. Hold firm to your boundaries (honestly I would go even further, I think you are still being too nice) good luck!", "NTA. You seem what I like to call a \u201ccaptain save a hoe\u201d. You feel the need to be there for the damsel in distress. Be empathetic. Just be a solid shoulder to cry on. Mostly for you though, because that\u2019s the type of person you are. Which can be a great thing. Buuuuuut I will say that\u2019s extremely draining. Them being dealt a raw deal is not your fault nor your problem. You are not a part of that equation at all. And it seems like they consistently find ways to weasel into your life and your plans. Because some way or another you\u2019re going to say yes. You proved that with this post. I\u2019m here to tell you though You should NEVER feel guilty for not wanting to spend energy on somebody.  Especially someone who is disrespectful of your time, your marriage, and space.\n\nI had a similar experience. And it was never a problem in my marriage until it was. And honestly, it\u2019s probably not gonna be an issue with your husband until it is. Just keep that in mind. Again, NTA", "NTA. 6 hours??? It get that it's important to you to be a good, supportive friend but it's time to shut this down. This person does not respect boundaries.", "NTA \n\nThis person is taking advantage of your politeness. Since being subtle isn't working, it's time to be direct. Their feelings are their responsibility, not yours. You are a hostage at this point. They are ignoring you and your own needs and are becoming a pest. \n\nI also wouldn't allow this passive aggressive hinting and whining about wanting you. It's disrespectful and creepy.  I've had to deal with a friend like this before and it's so hard to get rid of them without feeling rude. No is a complete sentence. \"Time for you to go home\" isn't mean.", "This sounds like Emotional Dependency that is getting mistaken for feelings on your coworkers part.  There's probably some professional that can give real advice on how to deal with this, but I think the biggest point I've read is really sticking to boundaries  that you've set, even if I feels a little rude. I don't know how much you guys hang out, but maybe limit it to a very set schedule, like dinner once a week, and only have the \"spontaneous\" hangouts to once a month. That way you're still a present and supportive friend, but with reasonable boundaries.\n\nAfter dinner/event: \"Well I'm pooped. It's been great having you over we'll do it again soon!\"\n\nNFL Games based on your last reply: \"I'll probably just have it on in the background cause I really need to get x done.\"\n\nAnd when they hit you with 'Dont you have time for me?': \"I value our friendship and feel I have been very supportive. I do not appreciate you trying to guilt trip me for having other responsibilities.\"\n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA. If they did ask, they should\u2019ve respected you when you said \u201cno\u201d. Otherwise, they arent a real friend", "NTA, but if you do decide to be honest with them and tell them how you feel word it carefully, they\u2019ll probably take it harder than they should based on their response to just not being able to come over for the game. But if they keep being so pushy and needy it may burn out your friendship and push you away, which it appears it already is starting to. Do they have hobbies or interests that align with social groups? Volunteering/politics/amateur sports/etc? You can go with them to one of these events to \u201chang out\u201d and perhaps they will meet new friends and can make it a regular thing, and then you can phase out going yourself once they seem like they\u2019re into that group or meet new friends", "NTA. You encouraged them to reach out if their mental health was spiraling (which I applaud and respect you for), not to insert themself in your life and overstay their welcome. You set boundaries for the relationship to remain healthy, and this person is consistently pushing and even breaking these boundaries. You have a life, they should have a life, for their own mental health. If they are spending six hours or more with you almost every day, and are sticking around after being cued to leave, that's not healthy for either of you. On top of that, you are starting to understand how unhealthy it is, which is leading them to manipulate you to get to spend more time with you. This is turning down a pretty toxic road, and it's probably a good idea to really start enforcing those boundaries, because if you don't, it'll start eroding at your own mental health.", "NTA \n\nBased on what you\u2019ve written it sounds like this friendship is very one-sided. Just because your friend is struggling doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t allowed to have boundaries. And it sounds like your friend is not really acting all that much like a friend of they continue to reference their feelings for you or try to be around you longer than appropriate/manipulate you into spending time with them. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be a supportive friend, but their problems and their unhealthy coping mechanisms are not your responsibility. You do not need to accommodate them at your own expense.", "It\u2019s kinda obvious why they have no friends.  NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also good on you for being there for them when they were sown before. Good job being a human being OP!", "You created your own monster. You don\u2019t know how to say no. You\u2019re wishy-washy in setting boundaries and that\u2019s why your friend is pushing back. They know your weak spots and are using those to manipulate you.
