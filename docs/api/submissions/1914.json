I recently moved back to my parents to assist my mother with my father's care. I have a brother Jack (28) and Tim 22m who lives at home with SIL.\n\nJack has an extremely toxic relationship with a girl I'll call abbey (25) he wanted to breakup with her and she stopped taking the pill and fell pregnant, they have constantly been together and breaking up since their son Tyler 3yo.\n\nMy brother works self they are currently split up (seems to be permanent). They split custody 60/40.\n\n Abbey refuses to talks to me since I told her I didn't want anything to do with her my parents dislike her but tolerate her for Tyler's sake but I do not need to have a family relationship with her. \n\nAbbey has started now asking my father a lot more to babysit Tyler, because my other SIL has told her she cannot babysit because her plate is full with their 3mo.\n\nMy father cannot say no, so always say yes and every time he does it ends up being me babysitting him because my dad physically cannot care for him, pretty much can't do nothing for himself. She only ever asks him to babysit when she knows I am off work.\n\nOn my off days I often do self care stuff like go to the gym, shopping or meeting my partner for lunch insert other activities like meeting friends etc. however since Tyler has been there more frequently I do not feel comfortable leaving him alone with my father so all of these things have dropped. Being a paramedic and part time caring for my dad self care is extremely important and it's a bit much caring for both my dad and a 3yo child that is not mine.\n\nAnyways, I had enough and messaged Abbey that she needs to stop asking my father to babysit because it falls on me to look after him because dad is in no condition to  do so. I told her she needs to look at finding a baby sitter or ask my brother or mother to take time off because I wont be caring for him anymore and I will contact child services that she's unfit and the child is placed in inadequate supervision. I told her if she needs someone to babysit she needs to hire a babysitter.\n\nAnyways she told both my mother and my brother about this and they both blew up up me, my mother pretty much said it takes a village to raise a child and I am equally responsible to help out. My brother is calling an asshole and saying his son will suffer.\n\n I told my mother that she can take time off work to baby sit him if it's an issue and that I did not agree to babysit my nephew and he is not my responsibility and I won't be baby sitting him in the future. If it was once in a while I wouldn't mind, but lately it's been every other day for 6 hrs+ and dad won't stop saying yes, she seems to ask him pretty much every time she knows I'm home not working. She won't ask him if he's alone.\n\nI told all 3 that if she continues to do this I will contact family services and she needs to get a baby sitter or ask my mother or brother to take time off work.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nI have spoken to both my brother and mother about this previously, both said they'd talk to her but didn't.

Also you deserve to your personal time to yourself and not have it taken up by being a carer for another person", "Nta. Where is this so called village because it only seems that your the only one watching him. You didn't sign up to be responsible for their child. Your brother and abbey needs to hire a sitter.", "NTA she\u2019s asking someone with dementia to look after a toddler?? fucked up", "Nice one.", "Just block her number on his phone.  Get rid of the opportunity for him to even say yes.", "NTA, you need to follow through if she keeps it up!", "NTA. Nobody who is upset with you is willing to step up or do what you've done.", "NTA. Tell them if she does it again you\u2019ll move back out and they\u2019ll also have to arrange for new care for your dad. If she does it anyway, call the cops and then move out.", "NTA. Stand your ground, OP.", "> My father cannot say no, so always say yes \n\nSo the mother thinks everything is okay, she is asking someone to babysit and that person is saying yes. You didn't mention if you'd brought up your grievances before blowing up.\n\n> I will contact child services that she's unfit and the child is placed in inadequate supervision.\n\nCome the fuck on.  This is another example of reddit being ridiculous.  THAT IS NOT A REASONABLE REACTION TO NOT WANTING TO BABYSIT A FAMILY MEMBER.  That is nuclear.\n\nBffr.", "NTA. She\u2019s taking advantage of your situation. You\u2019re there to help your father not be a free babysitter.", "I love the phrase, but hate when it's used to demand resources.\n\nI want other adults, especially strangers, to tell my kids to knock off bad behavior. I want chatty strangers to enjoy conversing with my verbose six year old. And I want to be able to help a kid tie their shoes or remind them to say \"please\" without wondering if their parent is going to hate me or feel judged. That's the village raising a child. \n\nProviding on-demand, un-compensated childcare and draining your financial resources is parenting.", "A very emphatic NTA!!!\n\nYou do an incredibly important job in very tough circumstances. In my opinion paramedics are real life superheroes. And that has never been more crystal clear than during the pandemic and the knock-on consequences for people's health we are experiencing now. The resulting strain on our health services has made your job even more stressful and you absolutely need to get your down time. How else are you supposed to keep serving your community if you burn out? \n\nThe fact that you have also moved back home to help care for your Dad when you aren't at work takes you from superhero to saint!! You are clearly an incredibly compassionate and kind man and, sadly, people will always try and take advantage of good people. How dare abbey try and load more onto you?! And then force it on to you by using your elderly and poorly Dad. She is an abominable human being and a terrible parent. You are not responsible for her AT ALL let alone equally!! I mean JFC. \n\nI am really glad that you have laid down entirely reasonable boundaries. Your mother and brother are making outrageous demands of you and I hope you stand firm. You should ask your mother if she really thinks that you doing the incredibly stressful job you do, and then caring for your Dad in your spare time, isn't enough to expect of one person. You may be a superhero but you are only human!! She should be extremely proud of you and protecting you from the entitled demands of your brother instead of trying to load you down even more. You can tell her from me that she's behaving like a massive Turd Blossom (Guardians of the Galaxy reference that feels appropriate). \n\nFinally, thank you for what you do wherever you do it. People rightly thank the military for their service. I passionately believe we need to thank the superheroes in our health services for their tireless service too!", "You are absolutely NTA.  Without a doubt, Abbey is, but your brother and mother are too.  So Abbey leaves a 3 year old standing at a closed door alone?  Call CPS the next time this happens.  She's just one bad decision away from harming him indirectly anyway.", "\"my mother pretty much said it takes a village to raise a child and I am equally responsible to help out.\"\n\nUmmmm nope my er organ wasn't anywhere near where that kid came from", "She\u2019s leaving a 3yr old unsupervised with a fella with dementia. \nNTA", "A village is reciprocal. A village helps each other. The relationship must go both ways.\n\nThis is just taking advantage of OP. NTA."]}
