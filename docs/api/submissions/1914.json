I recently moved back to my parents to assist my mother with my father's care. I have a brother Jack (28) and Tim 22m who lives at home with SIL.\n\nJack has an extremely toxic relationship with a girl I'll call abbey (25) he wanted to breakup with her and she stopped taking the pill and fell pregnant, they have constantly been together and breaking up since their son Tyler 3yo.\n\nMy brother works self they are currently split up (seems to be permanent). They split custody 60/40.\n\n Abbey refuses to talks to me since I told her I didn't want anything to do with her my parents dislike her but tolerate her for Tyler's sake but I do not need to have a family relationship with her. \n\nAbbey has started now asking my father a lot more to babysit Tyler, because my other SIL has told her she cannot babysit because her plate is full with their 3mo.\n\nMy father cannot say no, so always say yes and every time he does it ends up being me babysitting him because my dad physically cannot care for him, pretty much can't do nothing for himself. She only ever asks him to babysit when she knows I am off work.\n\nOn my off days I often do self care stuff like go to the gym, shopping or meeting my partner for lunch insert other activities like meeting friends etc. however since Tyler has been there more frequently I do not feel comfortable leaving him alone with my father so all of these things have dropped. Being a paramedic and part time caring for my dad self care is extremely important and it's a bit much caring for both my dad and a 3yo child that is not mine.\n\nAnyways, I had enough and messaged Abbey that she needs to stop asking my father to babysit because it falls on me to look after him because dad is in no condition to  do so. I told her she needs to look at finding a baby sitter or ask my brother or mother to take time off because I wont be caring for him anymore and I will contact child services that she's unfit and the child is placed in inadequate supervision. I told her if she needs someone to babysit she needs to hire a babysitter.\n\nAnyways she told both my mother and my brother about this and they both blew up up me, my mother pretty much said it takes a village to raise a child and I am equally responsible to help out. My brother is calling an asshole and saying his son will suffer.\n\n I told my mother that she can take time off work to baby sit him if it's an issue and that I did not agree to babysit my nephew and he is not my responsibility and I won't be baby sitting him in the future. If it was once in a while I wouldn't mind, but lately it's been every other day for 6 hrs+ and dad won't stop saying yes, she seems to ask him pretty much every time she knows I'm home not working. She won't ask him if he's alone.\n\nI told all 3 that if she continues to do this I will contact family services and she needs to get a baby sitter or ask my mother or brother to take time off work.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nI have spoken to both my brother and mother about this previously, both said they'd talk to her but didn't.

You should ask your mother if she really thinks that you doing the incredibly stressful job you do, and then caring for your Dad in your spare time, isn't enough to expect of one person. You may be a superhero but you are only human!! She should be extremely proud of you and protecting you from the entitled demands of your brother instead of trying to load you down even more.

She really is unfit by asking an elderly person who has at least dementia (as well as possibly other physical challenges) to look after her child. It is completely rational to report her to child services for this.\n\nIf you're looking after her child every other day for that long then that is NOT being \"part of a village to raise a child\" - it's turning you into a completely unwilling co-parent.

Brother's GF is choosing to accept the 'yes' of a man with dementia. She knows full well that your father cannot and should not be responsible for looking after a child. You need to stop bailing her out of that choice by not being the unwilling backup. Don't be there.\n4. You are in the house to help care for your dad. That's your share of the village work.\n5. Send your brother, his GF, and your mom each a certified (signed receipt letter - and hold onto your copy of their signed receipt) clearly informing them that you will not be responsible for watching the child and that the child should only be left at the house if one of them is fully responsible for the child's care. Make sure you note in the letter, that they all know your dad has dementia and physical limitations that make him incapable of taking responsibility for the child. And that under no circumstances do you consent to being responsible for the child. Leave the house if the child is dropped off.\n6. Your SIL has rightfully set (and is holding) her boundaries. How does she (and your other brother) keep from getting roped in? (Maybe you two/three can support each other on holding everyone else to respecting those boundaries.)\n7. Your mom is free to offer herself as a babysitter any time she likes. It is your brother's responsibility to (1) cover his share of custody time and (2) go back to court for more custody (and adjusted child support payments reflecting that) if GF keeps trying to force your family to cover some of her custody time. You can say this to them once (or in your letter). But then stop repeating yourself or waiting for them to accept their responsibilities/choices. You don't bail them out.\n8. If your mom/brother keep trying to force you to add this to your responsibilities, let them know that you may simply move back out and no longer be able to help as much with your dad.

Anybody who has a problem with this is welcome to contribute in time or money to provide the childcare *they* think is so important that other people need to sacrifice for it. As for your part of the village, those villages also tend to believe strongly in elder care by their children as well. And that is the service you are providing to your village.
