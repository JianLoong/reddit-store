I let her know when I was stable that I was in the ER trauma unit. She sent a text basically asking what happened and hoped I was okay.

I blocked her without updating her or keeping up communication myself. I should have let her know how I was. I didn\u2019t consider whether something was going on in her life. \n\n2. I didn\u2019t communicate properly and cut her off after 4 years because I felt like she didn\u2019t give a shit about me\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You were in the hospital and she ghosted you. That's not what a friend or gf would do.", "NTA. Aside from the fact that you were the ill one and it\u2019s not really reasonable to expect you to make all the effort communicating, it doesn\u2019t sound like this relationship is doing either of you much good and so it\u2019s probably for the best that you took her lack of care as a sign not to actively pursue contact.", "NTA - You don't owe her anything. I also wonder what kind of friends think you should continue pursuing this unhealthy relationship? If someone is an on again/off again, they should just not be there. It's the world's way of telling you this person is not the one for you. I hope you get better.", "NTA, but silver lining here - now you know exactly where she stands. She's had 3 months to check in on you.", "NTA. She ignored you. Return the favor. Block her out and leave her out. You had a bad relationship before the accident. Why go back to an even more damaged relationship?", "NTA. If she was a true girlfriend or even wanted that with you, she would be at that hospital with you, on the day you got injured, the moment she got your text. Not, not reply to a message you sent.", "NTA\n\nBut with on/off relationships. It's best to leave them off. They are just a toxic circle. Let logic overrule your loins.", "Ehhh ESH. Ghosting is just shitty, and two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Unblock her, tell her that was hurtful, allow her the chance to explain, and if she has no reasoning for her behavior, tell her it\u2019s off for good and move on with your life on the high road.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
