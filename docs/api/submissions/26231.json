My husband has a tight group of friends. Some of the things they do are just them. Some are for couples. Some are for families. All of these things are fine and normal.

Lol I travel with my husband too, but friend bonding time is sacred.", "NTA, you and your boys planned a trip.  You told her that this particular trip means a lot to you and you\u2019d make  it up to her when you returned.

She obviously wants to be included, which is fine, but manipulating you isn't. You're allowed time with your mates, it's healthy, just as spending time with your partner is, but they are seperate entities.", "NTA. You offered to take her on another trip.  Most likely your friends would resent it if you brought your girlfriend along because it\u2019s a bonding thing and you are right it would change the dynamic.  She needs to understand that just because you guys are in a relationship. It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t do things with just your friends.", "I was about to type you should invite her on your seperate trip with just the 2 of you and then read that's what you have already told her \ud83d\ude05 NTA. \n\nI think she may have trust issues, so I would question her about that. I don't know if you've cheated in the past or if she has any grounds to be jealous, but better to clear the air as this will only get worst if not addressed. \n\nMaybe start planning your trip together, that could show that you want to travel with her as much as you do with your friends. Start thinking about where you'd go and what you'd do. Even if you don't have money right away, it's never too early to start thinking about it.", "NTA", "NTA. A buddy trip would take on a very different dynamic when you add in a girlfriend. Inside jokes have to get explained, fun loses its momentum. Guys feel like they have to censor themselves. The same would happen if you were to go along with your gf on a girls weekend. Find a nice way to let her know that she\u2019s important to you but maintaining separate friendships is very important in human development. Couples have far healthier relationships when they don\u2019t spend every waking moment together.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed a guys trip. She sounds jealous.", "GF sounds like one of those who is so focused on her BF that she becomes needy and clingy. I'm guessing that she texts non-stop all day if you're not together.\n\nHaving a GF on a boys' trip throws the vibe out of sync. Everything ends up being about her at her insistence, so it's not a trip anymore: it's the same old, same old in a different location.\n\nAll her reasons for wanting to come are nonsense. There's only one reason: she wants to be in everything and make it all about her.", "NTA. It's going to be awkward for everyone if she comes, and that's nothing against her, it's just going to change the dynamic of the group too much.", "NTA. I can\u2019t understand why some women feel the need to go EVERYWHERE with their partner. You are fully in the clear because this is a guys trip. Would she let you in on a girls trip, or even a girls night? Most likely not! Enjoy the trip, Colorado is beautiful!", "NTA.  GF is waving a red flag at you.  Any woman that tries to drive a wedge in between you and your friends is a woman to run from. \n\nAlso, if a man/woman has no friends but just kind of gloms onto all of yours? Again, run away.  There is something not healthy there.", "NTA. It's normal and acceptable to keep friendships outside of romantic relationships, and a vacation with friends would not have the same dynamic with a partner there. Some people dislike their partners doing things without them or always want to be involved, and in some cases, it ruins an occasion.", "NTA, but it\u2019s worth recognizing that since she\u2019s been in a relationship with you, you\u2019ve taken at least two trips and neither has been with her. This is worth recognizing and I would plan a trip together.", "NTA it's perfectly fine to go on a guys trip.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to emotionally manipulate you in some really immature and passive aggressive ways. \n\nIf your friends were bringing partners, I\u2019d be on her side 100%. For a trip with friends, it would definitely change the dynamic to add one partner. (Maybe if you *all* had been friends for years prior to getting together, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case). \n\nI have many married friends. We go on friend holidays together, no partners. Their partners do likewise with their friends. It\u2019s very normal.", "Stage 5 clingon lol how ridiculous \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd23 NTA", "Ty for the perspective. I explained that if she wanted to go on a trip w her girlfriends that it's be rude to invite myself. She then responds by telling me she doesnt have a best friend and that it's unfair she has less oppertunities than me \ud83d\ude44", "Yes. The trip I made before was a cheap simple 3 nigjt trip to Ohio where we stayed in my grandparents RV. Nothing to really do. This next trip is \"crazy\" because it's really my first trip with zero parental guidance or help. And not only is there so much to do in Colorado (hiking downtown etc) but we're getting a rental car, airbnb, and it's a week long. I've never done this w friends before like this", "Seeing as before 5 months ago I made 2.5k a month - no. Now I have a decent job making 4k a month. I compromised by telling her we'll go on our own romantic cute lil trip later this year. Then it's the best of both worlds. I get a trip w my best friends, and she gets a trip just us together.", "good idea, distract gf with talks and plans about y'all's own trip.", "She also sounds extremely insecure", "Yeah that\u2019s bullshit. I doubt that she has absolutely no friend to go with on vacation", "That sounds AMAZING. Don\u2019t let her go, it will ruin the entire trip for you and especially for your friends. It would turn into a romantic vacation for her while your friends get ignored or made to feel awkward.", "Is one of your friends 25 or older?  I ask because getting a rental car may prove to be difficult at your age(s).", "Then nta", "NTA in my opinion then. If you\u2019re looking to assuage her concerns though, I would recommend booking your trip so it feels more set in stone.", "Info: Seeing as how the year is more than half over, when exactly do you plan to take her on this trip and is she gonna have any say in where you guys go? As the last part of your post sort of makes it sound like it's your way or the highway.", "[deleted]", "I think this is a great compromise. You are nta. FYI - my sister and brother in law have been married for 15 years and they\u2019ve never taken a vacation together. Always separate with their own friends. It\u2019s not unheard of", "To me, she either thinks he will cheat on that trip or feals left out, so showing that he actually does want to travel with her would probably sort out the \"left out\" part. Plus, a friend's vacation vs a couple's vacation is too complete different vibes and couple vacation will probably sound better to her then the friend vaca.", "Exactly! Thank you as I couldn't find the words to explain it.", "No. One is 21 but he can't even come the first day. I'm using Turo so I should be good despite colorado law saying 21+ for a rental car\ud83d\udc80", "Yeah we are tmr :) Thanks!", "I do separate trips with my girls and my husband misses me (he\u2019s very clingy), but he doesn\u2019t give me any issues like this. We also do trips together, and we also do couples trips with my friends and their partners. Everyone wins!", "Mhh , well I see her point in a small way , yous have been in a relationship for awhile I see how she\u2019d fell left out. I think you\u2019re NTA . But is your relationship that happy that you feel she\u2019s manipulating you and she\u2019d ruin the vibe ? . That doesn\u2019t sound like a happy relationship. Since you had one trip when you got together I see how she\u2019d want to be included in your life with your friends . I feel as though she needs a better boyfriend", "YTA. Time for her to break up with you. You're too immature.", "Nta", " NTA", "NTA, need to do some stuff separate", "NTA. I told my husband when we were dating, very important...DO NOT DITCH YOUR FRIENDS OVER ME, AS I WILL NOT DITCH MINE! It is good and healthy to have a life outside of the two of you. Sounds to me like she is a little insecure in the relationship though. Maybe she just wants to see Colorado too, plan the vacation with the two of you to somewhere new for both of you?", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s healthy to have some trips apart this way.", "NTA. She sounds too clingy and controlling", "'Around a year or two'  does he not know if they have been dating for one year or two?", "Bet that up", "That's not the question is it numbnuts. You are the asshole not OP", "Will this cute little trip also be a week long?", "If she has no close friends, maybe it's because of her boundary stomping behavior. Does she regularly invite herself to things where it's not appropriate for her to come?", "Yeah it kinda is my way or the highway. I was in a relationship for 3 years before we a girl who would always make me feel guilty for plans with friends, and while I still made time seeing them I realized how mentally exausting it was having to feel\nguilty or even deal with negativity when I'm trying to have fun with friends. I refuse to let that happen again in the slightest. If she loves me for who i am, someone who will hangout with his friends a lot and is social, she'll stay.", "Sometimes yeah. If I want to have a drink one time in 1-2 weeks with my friends she'll invite herself, then when I say no she'll say it's not fair because she gets this day off or because she wants to drink w me. Then to compromise i drink w her like the day after. Pretty annoying", "Ummm\u2026you might not be good.", "And with that mindset, she won't. You have a right to set boundaries and to spend time with friends on your own. So you aren't wrong to say that this trip important to you. That she should respect that this time around, it's just you and your friends.\n\nHowever, if you don't give your girlfriend a say in other areas, then you're not being respectful of her. You're just being a jerk. Which is why unless you're paying for entire thing and intend to surprise her with a destination, she DOES get a say in the trip for the two of you. Because that's something for you both, not just you.\n\nWhich is part of what my original question was. Will she get a say in that or do you intend to just follow the my way or the highway nonsense? If so, then you have as much to learn about relationships as she does.", "why not i already booked the rental car haha. Turo is a private app, it even said some cars I cannotnuse as im under 21 but its showing me cars i'm allowed to", "Good luck explaining that if you get pulled over. \u201cOfficer, it doesn\u2019t matter you have to be 21 to rent a car in CO, the app let me.\u201d\n\nIm sure Turo will absolutely help if you get in a fender bender. s/", "My mistake. ENTERPRISE said 21+. Denver Airport says minimum age 19"]}
