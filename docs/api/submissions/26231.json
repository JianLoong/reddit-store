You wouldn\u2019t insist on being a third wheel on a girls trip, right? So she should understand. She sounds like a stage 5 clinger. Have fun!", "NTA, not everything has to include her. My husband has a tight group of friends. Some of the things they do are just them. Some are for couples. Some are for families. All of these things are fine and normal. It would be a red flag if you never wanted her around your friends, but just wanting to plan a trip with your friends, without partners, isn\u2019t a mortal sin.", "Info you describe the trip as crazy,  what kind .of crazy? and say it's your first time doing som6crazy like this but that you've made the trip before. Can you expand on both?", "NTA in the least. I\u2019m a woman so I do girls trips. NO BOYS! Lol I travel with my husband too, but friend bonding time is sacred.", "NTA, you and your boys planned a trip.  You told her that this particular trip means a lot to you and you\u2019d make  it up to her when you returned. Your building memories and unfortunately it wouldn\u2019t be the same if she was there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She obviously wants to be included, which is fine, but manipulating you isn't. You're allowed time with your mates, it's healthy, just as spending time with your partner is, but they are seperate entities.", "NTA. You offered to take her on another trip.  Most likely your friends would resent it if you brought your girlfriend along because it\u2019s a bonding thing and you are right it would change the dynamic.  She needs to understand that just because you guys are in a relationship. It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t do things with just your friends.", "I was about to type you should invite her on your seperate trip with just the 2 of you and then read that's what you have already told her \ud83d\ude05 NTA. \n\nI think she may have trust issues, so I would question her about that. I don't know if you've cheated in the past or if she has any grounds to be jealous, but better to clear the air as this will only get worst if not addressed. \n\nMaybe start planning your trip together, that could show that you want to travel with her as much as you do with your friends. Start thinking about where you'd go and what you'd do. Even if you don't have money right away, it's never too early to start thinking about it.", "NTA", "NTA. A buddy trip would take on a very different dynamic when you add in a girlfriend. Inside jokes have to get explained, fun loses its momentum. Guys feel like they have to censor themselves. The same would happen if you were to go along with your gf on a girls weekend. Find a nice way to let her know that she\u2019s important to you but maintaining separate friendships is very important in human development. Couples have far healthier relationships when they don\u2019t spend every waking moment together.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed a guys trip. She sounds jealous.", "GF sounds like one of those who is so focused on her BF that she becomes needy and clingy. I'm guessing that she texts non-stop all day if you're not together.\n\nHaving a GF on a boys' trip throws the vibe out of sync. Everything ends up being about her at her insistence, so it's not a trip anymore: it's the same old, same old in a different location.\n\nAll her reasons for wanting to come are nonsense. There's only one reason: she wants to be in everything and make it all about her.", "NTA. It's going to be awkward for everyone if she comes, and that's nothing against her, it's just going to change the dynamic of the group too much.", "NTA. I can\u2019t understand why some women feel the need to go EVERYWHERE with their partner. You are fully in the clear because this is a guys trip. Would she let you in on a girls trip, or even a girls night? Most likely not! Enjoy the trip, Colorado is beautiful!", "NTA.  GF is waving a red flag at you.  Any woman that tries to drive a wedge in between you and your friends is a woman to run from. \n\nAlso, if a man/woman has no friends but just kind of gloms onto all of yours? Again, run away.  There is something not healthy there.", "NTA. It's normal and acceptable to keep friendships outside of romantic relationships, and a vacation with friends would not have the same dynamic with a partner there. Some people dislike their partners doing things without them or always want to be involved, and in some cases, it ruins an occasion.", "NTA, but it\u2019s worth recognizing that since she\u2019s been in a relationship with you, you\u2019ve taken at least two trips and neither has been with her. This is worth recognizing and I would plan a trip together.", "NTA it's perfectly fine to go on a guys trip.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to emotionally manipulate you in some really immature and passive aggressive ways. \n\nIf your friends were bringing partners, I\u2019d be on her side 100%. For a trip with friends, it would definitely change the dynamic to add one partner. (Maybe if you *all* had been friends for years prior to getting together, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case). \n\nI have many married friends. We go on friend holidays together, no partners. Their partners do likewise with their friends. It\u2019s very normal.", "Stage 5 clingon lol how ridiculous \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd23 NTA", "Ty for the perspective. I explained that if she wanted to go on a trip w her girlfriends that it's be rude to invite myself. She then responds by telling me she doesnt have a best friend and that it's unfair she has less oppertunities than me \ud83d\ude44", "Yes. The trip I made before was a cheap simple 3 nigjt trip to Ohio where we stayed in my grandparents RV. Nothing to really do. This next trip is \"crazy\" because it's really my first trip with zero parental guidance or help. And not only is there so much to do in Colorado (hiking downtown etc) but we're getting a rental car, airbnb, and it's a week long. I've never done this w friends before like this", "Seeing as before 5 months ago I made 2.5k a month - no. Now I have a decent job making 4k a month. I compromised by telling her we'll go on our own romantic cute lil trip later this year. Then it's the best of both worlds. I get a trip w my best friends, and she gets a trip just us together.", "good idea, distract gf with talks and plans about y'all's own trip.", "She also sounds extremely insecure", "Yeah that\u2019s bullshit. I doubt that she has absolutely no friend to go with on vacation", "That sounds AMAZING. Don\u2019t let her go, it will ruin the entire trip for you and especially for your friends. It would turn into a romantic vacation for her while your friends get ignored or made to feel awkward.", "Is one of your friends 25 or older?  I ask because getting a rental car may prove to be difficult at your age(s).", "Then nta", "NTA in my opinion then. If you\u2019re looking to assuage her concerns though, I would recommend booking your trip so it feels more set in stone.", "Info: Seeing as how the year is more than half over, when exactly do you plan to take her on this trip and is she gonna have any say in where you guys go? As the last part of your post sort of makes it sound like it's your way or the highway.", "[deleted]", "I think this is a great compromise. You are nta. FYI - my sister and brother in law have been married for 15 years and they\u2019ve never taken a vacation together. Always separate with their own friends. It\u2019s not unheard of", "To me, she either thinks he will cheat on that trip or feals left out, so showing that he actually does want to travel with her would probably sort out the \"left out\" part. Plus, a friend's vacation vs a couple's vacation is too complete different vibes and couple vacation will probably sound better to her then the friend vaca.", "Exactly! Thank you as I couldn't find the words to explain it.", "No. One is 21 but he can't even come the first day. I'm using Turo so I should be good despite colorado law saying 21+ for a rental car\ud83d\udc80", "Yeah we are tmr :) Thanks!", "I do separate trips with my girls and my husband misses me (he\u2019s very clingy), but he doesn\u2019t give me any issues like this. We also do trips together, and we also do couples trips with my friends and their partners. Everyone wins!"]}
