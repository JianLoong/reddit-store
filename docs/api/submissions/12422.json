I have a good paying job, and so does my boyfriend. My boyfriend has a younger sister Cassie19. Cassie works part time and is in college. My boyfriend, Cassie, and I, planned a road trip to go to Florida for Cassie\u2019s spring break. Even though she didn\u2019t make great money, she had put some away, and we had agreed to help her pay SOME towards expenses. I had over heard her mom talk about how proud she was for putting away nearly 1,000 for this trip, so she wasn\u2019t going on this trip broke. We had agreed to fully pay for the hotel stay, and help her pay for other events if needed.\n\nWe left during the weekend, and stopped to get some fast food on the way there, which she paid for herself. When we arrived in Florida we went to this nice restaurant, which we split her bill with her(paid half of it). We had went to a beach, where you could rent jet skis, and pay for other extra activities. She asked us to pay for a jet ski for her, which my boyfriend did. \n\nBasically long story short she had asked us to pay for majority of activities we went too the first two days. She pretty much only spent her money shopping there. Yesterday comes along, and she continues this. After raking up the bill at the restaurant and asking us to pay, I finally said \u201cdidn\u2019t you save up money for this trip?\u201d She got upset and said she did, but we had agreed to help pay for her expenses, and that was shopping money. I told her no, that isn\u2019t how it works and that we only agreed to pay towards some, and that she was being greedy.\n\nShe got upset and paid herself, and later complained to my boyfriend, who defended me, which caused another argument. Apparently she texted my bf mom, and my bf mom got angry and texted my bf saying we were backing out of our word, and how Cassie is only 19, and we couldn\u2019t sabotage her like that.\n\nIt\u2019s been an awkward next day and we still have another day here. She\u2019s in a pissy mood. She is an adult though and should realize and understand we can\u2019t pay for everything for her.", "created_utc": 1678942482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11skkwg/aita_for_refusing_to_help_pay_for_all_of_my/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She really expected you 2 to foot the bill for her trip entirely?!", "NTA. Let her ungrateful ass sit at the hotel", "NTA.  It would have helped if you and Cassie had discussed this in advance, but it is unreasonable of her to expect to shop with $1,000 but not kick in for any meals or activities.", "Next time make the rules more clear. NTA.", "NTA, my sister and her bf are going to Aruba for a week.\nI haven't taken a vacation in a while so I wanted to go as well. Lo and behold some things happen and I can't afford to go.\nIf you can't afford the vacation you just don't go.", "She is greedy though. She's hoarding her money and wanting to spend the OP's money. The OP is only three years older than her so she probably isn't rolling in cash either.", "Nta she's an adult and she knew you both agree to pay for some not all of her expenses. Even if she has a part time she could have saved more if she wanted. Maybe next time you vacation with her again tell her that all her expenses are on her or you don't need to include her on any of your trips if she can't pay for her stuff.", "ESH here there should have been a CLEAR conversation about what you would pay for vs. expect her to pay for, or a cap on the dollar amount you would pay or something. Saying you would pay \"some\" of the expenses was way too vague.", "Esh. She is ridiculous for whining to mommy. \n\nSeems obvious shes spoiled by her famiky so you should have nailed down who pays for what prior to trip. I.e. say upfront you/bf will cover gas, hotel and x, y, z activities but she covers everything else.\n\nYou and BF left things too vague and opened the door for this.", "ESH. Y\u2019all should have sat down and talked about how much you and your bf were subsidizing her. Like exact dollar amount. I mean paying for the hotel in itself is pretty generous but what does \u201csome\u201d mean? That\u2019s too subjective.", "NTA. Somehow she seems to have gotten the idea she could pay for all her nice shopping because you two were paying for everything else. I would love to know what she sent nearly 1k on. Regardless I think she is just trying it on. You\u2019ve already been fair subsidising her and if her mom has a problem she can transfer her some money. Good on your boyfriend standing up for you; makes me also wonder if he\u2019s experienced something like this \u2018she\u2019s just a BABY\u2019 thing before", "A small YTA for not being specific on what expenses you wanted Cassie to cover. Each of you had a different idea of what that meant. I don't know...... You'll pay her hotel and one meal a day. Or give her a meal allowance up to a certain amount. Give a budget for \"extras\" like the jet skis. This was all too vague.", "NTA. She is expecting you and her brother to essentially assume the parental role of paying for all the neccessities  like meal, travel and accomodations while she as the kid spends her money on fun stuff.", "\"She's only 19\"??? You're only 22!   Both of you are babies.  It's not unreasonable to ask her to pay some of the way for the trip.  You guys should have had a good talk about this before hand though, all three sat together, making it absolutely clear what she was responsible for.  I'm gonna go with NTA.", "Light NAH and strong OP NTA. Sounds like sister and brother should have had a deeper discussion about what\u2019s what", "NTA.  She's greedy, selfish, entitled.......You held up your end of the deal, she needs to pay her own way with her own money.", "NTA but in the future I suggest making a list of what you will and will not cover. \"Some do your activities\" is very vague and giving her wiggle room to try to use you guys.", "NTA she's a freeloader", "I think it was made to be vague on purpose as to not make it feel like she couldn\u2019t go. Like if she blew through 1k of her money on food and other normal vacation expenses. OP and BF would have chipped in for all the rest and not complained. However 1k in shopping expenses is absolutely not a normal line of thought when you\u2019re not paying for a vacation yourself. Even when I went on vacation with my parents as an adult I realized the optional parts would not be funded by them. Like when your friends offer to pay for dinner, it\u2019s basic etiquette not to order the 1k made of gold burger. You can\u2019t say your too poor to afford optional leisure activities and drop 1k at the outlets.", "And using that term in public is probably not the way to go.  Time and place."]}
