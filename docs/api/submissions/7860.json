I also follow a low carb diet for health reasons (used to have horrible IBS and mood swings).\n\nMy girlfriend 'Elle' (28F) also eats fairly healthy overall, but I do most of the cooking. Before we got together, Elle mostly just ordered takeout and didn't cook much.\n\nWe got together, and she's pretty happy overall with our eating habits because I'm a good cook, but she still buys processed junk food and less healthy items and keeps them around the house.\n\nI also bake a lot and Elle is always happy to try what I make.\n\nLast year I proposed to Elle and she said yes. We're now in the stages of wedding planning.\n\nRecently, I noticed that Elle had gained some weight, and I'm a little worried about her health.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, things were closed (covid) and so we went on a lot of hikes, and we used to go for walks multiple mornings a week. This, plus the fact that I was cooking for us and she was eating less takeout and processed food led to her losing about 15lbs by accident. She wasn't overweight, but had gained some due to covid, lost some, and after meeting me had lost the rest.\n\nI know living a sedentary life has its health consequences and really isn't good for you, I really love Elle and want her to be around for a long time.\n\nI feel like it's partially my fault that she is gaining weight, because we used to go for more hikes and walks together, but then I started jogging in place every. morning while watching TV (got too hot over the summer to walk and I wanted more exercise) so now instead of us going for a walk, I'm there jogging while Elle just sits and watches TV with me.\n\nI love Elle and find her very beautiful, I just worry about her health, and her not getting enough exercise.\n\nEvery now and then I suggest she jog in place with me, or I'll send her on an errand to the grocery store so she can get at least a little walk in, and she's happy to go get things, but doesn't ever jog with me.\n\nToday, I tried to tell her that I was worried about her health, and she got upset.\n\nI don't think I said anything bad, I told her how much I love her and want her to be around, but am worried she doesn't get enough exercise.\n\nShe took it fairly well but was very quiet, and seemed kind of sad. Later I got an angry text from Elle's step-sister saying that I was fat-shaming and calling me a horrible person.\n\nAITA here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nOk, I see how everyone is focusing on the weight thing, and I'm sorry if that's how it might have come off.\n\nMy main concern is Elle's sedentary lifestyle. She sits around all day for work, and some days we don't even leave the house.\n\nI apologize if I came off as being judgmental about what she eats or her weight. This has NOTHING to do with what she eats or how she looks. Her eating habits have gotten much better since we got together and I don't care if she eats carbs or some junk food here and there.\n\nI am simply concerned because her life got a lot more sedentary and she started to gain some weight. My main concern is the sedentary-ness. If she were the same weight but more actively moving around and getting her heart going, I wouldn't be saying anything.\n\nJust the weight gain was what made me notice how sedentary her life had gotten.

You can actually trigger or exacerbate mental health issues and eating disorders by doing this. \n\nFor you: you will NEVER be happy controlling her behavior. Doesn\u2019t matter if it is food, her friends, clothes- whatever. Your fianc\u00e9 is not an extension of you.

You haven't mentioned Elle's weight, but there's a huge difference between morbidly obese and just a little overweight. It's clear that jogging isn't an activity she enjoys. Instead of encouraging her to find another form of exercise, you make her feel bad for not enjoing what you do. It's possible that she only hiked and walked with you previously because she wanted to spend time with you. Finally, she's an adult capable of making her own decisions, and if her weight becomes a problem for you, you would need to leave the relationship.", "YTA so much. If Elle was obese then I would understand your concern. But she\u2019s not even overweight, let alone dangerously so. Let her live", "YTA. You said it yourself, she's not overweight, so you're not worried about her weight fluctuating because of her health, it is solely about vanity. Sure, it's important to lead an active lifestyle, but not everyone needs to jog everyday to be healthy. Maybe she would like to do some other activity to keep active. Maybe she even does, do you know what she's up to every minute of every day? Does she have an active or sedentary job? Because if she's running around or standing up throughout her entire workday while you work a desk job, of course it makes sense for you to do more physical activity during your free time. Because if it really is about health, you should remember that it's about being physically active in whatever form that is, and that it can be done in many other ways than going for a jog or going to the gym for that matter.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to make health choices for Elle. You are not responsible for her health choices. You take a chance in any relationship that you might lose them for heath related reasons.

My own weight, and my wife's weight, has fluctuated just like everyone else's does, but my love and attraction for her haven't. We've gone through more and less active periods. And during the inactive periods, I do find myself thinking \"Holy shit, I have no idea what I would do if something happened to her. Maybe we should go for more hikes\"", "Yep that\u2019s exactly it. YTA OP, you aren\u2019t hiding it as well as you think you are", " We, and her, have no idea what her health situation actually is? Does her doctor say her health is at risk?  Spouting 'ohmygod her poor health what could we ever doooooooo' while her not actually having any health issues is fucking dumb. Also her whole post is just so icky! Like she eats my baked goods and I'm fine with that but dare she buy her own snacks! In the chokey she goes! \n\nWe also have NO idea what level of exercise she actually does. It seems to be very much her way or the highway so maybe she does yoga or something but she doesn't view it as good enough? Man even just being the main cleaner of the house can be a workout! Vaccuming, moping, lugging washing around etc can all get your heartrate up. If she is just sitting around and does absolutely nothing all day everyday then yea she could defs do with some activity. But fucking go about it the right way OP, have an understanding conversation about it, don't bring fucking weight up!!! And if she doesn't want to get her activity levels up then fucking leave it, it's her body and her life. \n\nAlso being like: \"baaabe! I'll send you on a little errand, so you can go for a little walk, I'll time you to see how fast you go! Off ya pop ya little fatty.\" Is like so patronising! If my partner was like you haven't exercised recently I'll send you on an errand to do a walk... I would look at him with such disgust and would literally get fat just to spite his patronising arse. \n\nBUT if he was like, I just got this sick workout we could do together in the loungeroom, or let's go for a walk together, or I was thinking of joining the gym... Wanna go with me? I'd be like yea cool and do the things I want to with him. \n\n\nI know I am veering off what this post is actually about, but I just have to say this while on the topic of weight and health. I know this is going to blow Reddit's mind and kill me with downvotes but... People can be overweight and still be healthy \ud83e\udd2f. \n\nWeight is very subjective from person to person. There are so many new studies out there delving into how genetics plays such a massive role in it. If you gave every person in the world the exact same amount of calories you would still have a varying array of body types. \n\nFor example, everybody knows that person who eats a highly processed diet, doesn't exercise and is very thin. Strangers would see them down the street and you'd be like oh that person is so healthy. Whereas you can have an overweight person that eats nutritionally and exercises 5 days a week but still has excess fat. People see them and automatically assume they are at risk for a myriad of health issue, when they aren't. \n\nAlso fucking health conditions come into play, i.e hypothyroidism, POS, antidepressants etc can all cause weight gain that is NOT due to excercise and nutrition.\n\nOBVIOUSLY I'm not talking about the people who are morbidly obese and eat a highly processed diet. BUT WEIGHT IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF HEALTH. Exercise and diet are. plain and simple. So the next time you want to judge someone for being overweight, just fucking don't.
