You said it yourself, she's not overweight, so you're not worried about her weight fluctuating because of her health, it is solely about vanity. Sure, it's important to lead an active lifestyle, but not everyone needs to jog everyday to be healthy. Maybe she would like to do some other activity to keep active. Maybe she even does, do you know what she's up to every minute of every day? Does she have an active or sedentary job? Because if she's running around or standing up throughout her entire workday while you work a desk job, of course it makes sense for you to do more physical activity during your free time. Because if it really is about health, you should remember that it's about being physically active in whatever form that is, and that it can be done in many other ways than going for a jog or going to the gym for that matter.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to make health choices for Elle.
