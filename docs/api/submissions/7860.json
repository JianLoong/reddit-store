I also follow a low carb diet for health reasons (used to have horrible IBS and mood swings).\n\nMy girlfriend 'Elle' (28F) also eats fairly healthy overall, but I do most of the cooking. Before we got together, Elle mostly just ordered takeout and didn't cook much.\n\nWe got together, and she's pretty happy overall with our eating habits because I'm a good cook, but she still buys processed junk food and less healthy items and keeps them around the house.\n\nI also bake a lot and Elle is always happy to try what I make.\n\nLast year I proposed to Elle and she said yes. We're now in the stages of wedding planning.\n\nRecently, I noticed that Elle had gained some weight, and I'm a little worried about her health.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, things were closed (covid) and so we went on a lot of hikes, and we used to go for walks multiple mornings a week. This, plus the fact that I was cooking for us and she was eating less takeout and processed food led to her losing about 15lbs by accident. She wasn't overweight, but had gained some due to covid, lost some, and after meeting me had lost the rest.\n\nI know living a sedentary life has its health consequences and really isn't good for you, I really love Elle and want her to be around for a long time.\n\nI feel like it's partially my fault that she is gaining weight, because we used to go for more hikes and walks together, but then I started jogging in place every. morning while watching TV (got too hot over the summer to walk and I wanted more exercise) so now instead of us going for a walk, I'm there jogging while Elle just sits and watches TV with me.\n\nI love Elle and find her very beautiful, I just worry about her health, and her not getting enough exercise.\n\nEvery now and then I suggest she jog in place with me, or I'll send her on an errand to the grocery store so she can get at least a little walk in, and she's happy to go get things, but doesn't ever jog with me.\n\nToday, I tried to tell her that I was worried about her health, and she got upset.\n\nI don't think I said anything bad, I told her how much I love her and want her to be around, but am worried she doesn't get enough exercise.\n\nShe took it fairly well but was very quiet, and seemed kind of sad. Later I got an angry text from Elle's step-sister saying that I was fat-shaming and calling me a horrible person.\n\nAITA here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nOk, I see how everyone is focusing on the weight thing, and I'm sorry if that's how it might have come off.\n\nMy main concern is Elle's sedentary lifestyle. She sits around all day for work, and some days we don't even leave the house.\n\nI apologize if I came off as being judgmental about what she eats or her weight. This has NOTHING to do with what she eats or how she looks. Her eating habits have gotten much better since we got together and I don't care if she eats carbs or some junk food here and there.\n\nI am simply concerned because her life got a lot more sedentary and she started to gain some weight. My main concern is the sedentary-ness. If she were the same weight but more actively moving around and getting her heart going, I wouldn't be saying anything.\n\nJust the weight gain was what made me notice how sedentary her life had gotten.

You can actually trigger or exacerbate mental health issues and eating disorders by doing this. \n\nFor you: you will NEVER be happy controlling her behavior. Doesn\u2019t matter if it is food, her friends, clothes- whatever. Your fianc\u00e9 is not an extension of you.

You haven't mentioned Elle's weight, but there's a huge difference between morbidly obese and just a little overweight. It's clear that jogging isn't an activity she enjoys. Instead of encouraging her to find another form of exercise, you make her feel bad for not enjoing what you do. It's possible that she only hiked and walked with you previously because she wanted to spend time with you. Finally, she's an adult capable of making her own decisions, and if her weight becomes a problem for you, you would need to leave the relationship.", "YTA so much. If Elle was obese then I would understand your concern. But she\u2019s not even overweight, let alone dangerously so. Let her live", "YTA. You said it yourself, she's not overweight, so you're not worried about her weight fluctuating because of her health, it is solely about vanity. Sure, it's important to lead an active lifestyle, but not everyone needs to jog everyday to be healthy. Maybe she would like to do some other activity to keep active. Maybe she even does, do you know what she's up to every minute of every day? Does she have an active or sedentary job? Because if she's running around or standing up throughout her entire workday while you work a desk job, of course it makes sense for you to do more physical activity during your free time. Because if it really is about health, you should remember that it's about being physically active in whatever form that is, and that it can be done in many other ways than going for a jog or going to the gym for that matter.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to make health choices for Elle. You are not responsible for her health choices. You take a chance in any relationship that you might lose them for heath related reasons.

My own weight, and my wife's weight, has fluctuated just like everyone else's does, but my love and attraction for her haven't. We've gone through more and less active periods. And during the inactive periods, I do find myself thinking \"Holy shit, I have no idea what I would do if something happened to her. Maybe we should go for more hikes\"", "Yep that\u2019s exactly it. YTA OP, you aren\u2019t hiding it as well as you think you are", " We, and her, have no idea what her health situation actually is? Does her doctor say her health is at risk?  Spouting 'ohmygod her poor health what could we ever doooooooo' while her not actually having any health issues is fucking dumb. Also her whole post is just so icky! Like she eats my baked goods and I'm fine with that but dare she buy her own snacks! In the chokey she goes! \n\nWe also have NO idea what level of exercise she actually does. It seems to be very much her way or the highway so maybe she does yoga or something but she doesn't view it as good enough? Man even just being the main cleaner of the house can be a workout! Vaccuming, moping, lugging washing around etc can all get your heartrate up. If she is just sitting around and does absolutely nothing all day everyday then yea she could defs do with some activity. But fucking go about it the right way OP, have an understanding conversation about it, don't bring fucking weight up!!! And if she doesn't want to get her activity levels up then fucking leave it, it's her body and her life. \n\nAlso being like: \"baaabe! I'll send you on a little errand, so you can go for a little walk, I'll time you to see how fast you go! Off ya pop ya little fatty.\" Is like so patronising! If my partner was like you haven't exercised recently I'll send you on an errand to do a walk... I would look at him with such disgust and would literally get fat just to spite his patronising arse. \n\nBUT if he was like, I just got this sick workout we could do together in the loungeroom, or let's go for a walk together, or I was thinking of joining the gym... Wanna go with me? I'd be like yea cool and do the things I want to with him. \n\n\nI know I am veering off what this post is actually about, but I just have to say this while on the topic of weight and health. I know this is going to blow Reddit's mind and kill me with downvotes but... People can be overweight and still be healthy \ud83e\udd2f. \n\nWeight is very subjective from person to person. There are so many new studies out there delving into how genetics plays such a massive role in it. If you gave every person in the world the exact same amount of calories you would still have a varying array of body types. \n\nFor example, everybody knows that person who eats a highly processed diet, doesn't exercise and is very thin. Strangers would see them down the street and you'd be like oh that person is so healthy. Whereas you can have an overweight person that eats nutritionally and exercises 5 days a week but still has excess fat. People see them and automatically assume they are at risk for a myriad of health issue, when they aren't. \n\nAlso fucking health conditions come into play, i.e hypothyroidism, POS, antidepressants etc can all cause weight gain that is NOT due to excercise and nutrition.\n\nOBVIOUSLY I'm not talking about the people who are morbidly obese and eat a highly processed diet. BUT WEIGHT IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF HEALTH. Exercise and diet are. plain and simple. So the next time you want to judge someone for being overweight, just fucking don't.

For him it didn\u2019t matter that I was a completely different person from him, and what worked for him didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nLike you he wanted to control the situation, and I get that you feel some pride for being responsible for and weight-loss she had, but now it\u2019s all her fault that she gained weight back, let\u2019s just say it, because you think she\u2019s lazy, I mean \u2026because she has a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nYeah you love her but she still don\u2019t fit into this box that you feel she should concerning her weight. Not her health, her weight. You have made no indication that you encouraged her to see a doctor, because weight gain can be so many different reasons then she eats junk food and is lazy, in your opinion. She could be dealing with a health issue, or a mental issue. Or she could just be tired of trying to live up to a standard you feel she should. \n\nYour post reeks of vanity. If you value working out and eating to stay thin. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but to push that onto your partner, especially manipulating her into exercise and eating the foods you deem appropriate, makes you the AH. \n\nFind a partner that hold your values, don\u2019t hurt someone else so that you can feel good about what you do for them.", "Baked goods are not junk food... Badly processed foods are", "That amount is quite normal to fluctuate over a year, winter just is not a time people want to do outside sports often. I love outside sports and water sports. But when it's freezing I don't go for a 4 hour hike, or step into a kayak. I swim less (don't like inside swimming), I cannot do yoga in the park with friends. \n\nIt's not uncommon to gain a little in winter and when spring hits and I want to be outside all hours of the day it will be lost again.", "Yup, so much fat logic nonsense on this thread. People actually claiming being overweight is healthier, ugh.", "Depends on how tall she is. I've gained 15 pounds since I've moved countries to be with my husband. I refuse to buy a car until the insane prices come back down to normal which should be within the next 4-5 months. I used to go to the gym daily, swimming once a week and have a good routine going. I can't seem to workout at home, I don't know why and even with hikes every so often, I am gaining weight because I'm eating like how I used to when I went to the gym. None of my pants fit me so I'm always wearing yoga pants and I look considerably different. 15lbs is very noticeable on a 5' frame. \nThis is just how I look. How I feel is different story, I can tell I am not healthy anymore.", "Lol this got me. Signed, a Covid era porker", "It only makes sense (to me) if it's a warmup for something else. Easier to do stretches after jogging a bit, for example.\n\nBut yeah. Jogging in place while watching TV seems strange.", "I think it's pretty odd too. There are plenty of other exercises they could do if they wanted a bit of movement while watching TV. Or better solution would definitely be to get outside for activity together. Too hot as OP claims? Do yoga", "Thank you I\u2019m actually borderline cringing imagining my partner in my living room jogging in place every morning!! Like what!!!", "I agree. OP sounds obsessed with her partner's weight.", "THANK YOU! I've had issues with my appetite and was referred to specialists. I'm talking about people who studied food and how it gets processed when people eat (more to it, obviously, I'm simplifying) and they told me the same thing. If everybody in the world ate the same food and had the same level of activity there would still be different body types. I don't know why people refuse to believe it. \n\nThin person, eating a greasy burger and fries and drinking soda: \"I'm so lucky! I can eat what I want and never exercise and I stay thin! Thanks, genetics!\"\n\nSociety: \"Lucky you! I wish I had your genetics!\"\n\nHeavy person, eating a baked potato with steamed broccoli and drinking water: \"I don't get it, I hate sweets and I hit the gym four times a week but I'm still heavy. Must be my genetics.\"\n\nSociety: \"Quit blaming genetics and stop eating, you fat hog!\"\n\nIrks me to no end!", "It's also good for working on your overall technique like a treadmill, let's you focus on bringing your heels higher, landing on the right parts of your feet, reducing wobble, and keeping your core tight like you mentioned.", "What you have is a snapshot now.  Imagine being surprised in 30 years when he has colon and lung cancer.  It\u2019s like driving full pelt at a tree and thinking you\u2019re fine as you\u2019ve not hit it yet.\n\nAnd what about passive smoking and your health?", "Thin people always overestimate the calorie content in what they\u2019re eating while overweight people always underestimate. That\u2019s how we get the scenario you described.", "They also have a higher chance of getting cancer. But this overlooks something very important. A lot of people who get cancer and waste away lose a ton of weight in the process. They don't necessarily die because they were thin. They thinned out dying, so yes it makes sense that people who didn't waste away ultimately had better outcomes.", "True! Subway aren't allowed to call their bread \"Bread\" in Europe because it has way too much sugar to fit the classification.", "Plus, like I\u2019d have to pop on a sports bra to jog (in place or otherwise), but not to walk around the neighborhood, then change back out of it afterwards.", "Like damn I watch my Sims do that all the time", "I\u2019m sorry, but this is such an oversimplification. There are tons of conditions like fibromyalgia and PCOS that cause your body not to process fat properly, leading you to gain weight and not be able to lose it. I can eat plain ass vegetables for every meal and not lose weight. \u201cCalories in vs calories out\u201d only works when your body is functioning normally.", "How is the scenario over/under estimating? Those foods are fatty, they eat like that all the time. They stay thin.\n\nThe other foods are healthy and they go to the gym. Still heavy.\n\nThere are people like that. I don't understand why most people refuse to accept that.", "Not even once.", "Am Australian. Agreed.", "Don't put it in the fridge man...\n\nFreeze it immediately when you buy it... Take out a few slices before going to eat... Make some coffee and they will be unfrozen but still have that harder crust. keep that same fresh taste"]}
