For reasons I can't explain, my mom seems to be absolutely in love with the condo and talks about it frequently.\n\nOne day\u2014and without my knowledge\u2014my mom offered up my place to two of her friends, a pair of women around her age, that were going to be travelling to my city. She called to ask me after-the-fact, almost certainly expecting that I'd say yes. She tried to sweeten the deal / guilt-trip me into it by saying they'd cook for me, and that one of them just lost both her husband and son and could use the financial assistance and company. But the reality is that I've never met these women, both me and my husband work during the day, and I feel like I don't owe my place to these strangers, no matter their life situation. I recommended some hotels they could stay at instead and left it at that.\n\nHere's where it gets weird: When I returned home to attend my grandmother's funeral, this woman was there and confronted me. It was, frankly, uncomfortable. She introduced herself as \"I'm so-and-so, the person who you wouldn't let stay at your place.\" I brushed it off with a friendly \"it's nice to finally meet you\u2014I hope you enjoyed your time in \\[city\\],\" but I couldn't help but feel surprised that she, a total stranger to me, was offended that I wouldn't offer up my place.

The fact you've never met barely has any bearing on my judgement since even if you had known the people, you'd be under no obligation to follow through with your mother's offerings especially since she didn't get your approval beforehand.
