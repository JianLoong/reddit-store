We've got a guest room and guest bath, so it's not usually an imposition. For reasons I can't explain, my mom seems to be absolutely in love with the condo and talks about it frequently.\n\nOne day\u2014and without my knowledge\u2014my mom offered up my place to two of her friends, a pair of women around her age, that were going to be travelling to my city. She called to ask me after-the-fact, almost certainly expecting that I'd say yes. She tried to sweeten the deal / guilt-trip me into it by saying they'd cook for me, and that one of them just lost both her husband and son and could use the financial assistance and company. But the reality is that I've never met these women, both me and my husband work during the day, and I feel like I don't owe my place to these strangers, no matter their life situation. I recommended some hotels they could stay at instead and left it at that.\n\nHere's where it gets weird: When I returned home to attend my grandmother's funeral, this woman was there and confronted me. It was, frankly, uncomfortable. She introduced herself as \"I'm so-and-so, the person who you wouldn't let stay at your place.\" I brushed it off with a friendly \"it's nice to finally meet you\u2014I hope you enjoyed your time in \\[city\\],\" but I couldn't help but feel surprised that she, a total stranger to me, was offended that I wouldn't offer up my place. I empathize that she's had a lot of hardships and that my actions meant she had to pay hundreds of dollars for accommodation, but I've still got a strong feeling that I'm NTA here.

Your mom and her friend were wrong.

Your mom and her friend crossed a lot of boundaries and you handled the situation well.", "NTA.  You have zero obligation to house strangers in your condo.  Your mother has less than zero permission to offer your premises or your services without your previous agreement.\r  \n\r  \nGlad you (gently) kept this woman who showed up at a distance. Congrats on standing your ground.", "NTA. Your mom is a nut job for offering accommodations in your home to strangers! I\u2019m glad you stood your ground and said no. For this strange woman to approach you right after your grandmother\u2019s funeral is shocking, to say the least! She clearly has NO class, but her lack of decorum or self-awareness screams \u201cPsycho!\u201d Just what was she trying to accomplish? You dodged a nasty, toxic bullet! Your mom owes you an apology.", "NTA, how dare she act that way at your family member\u2019s funeral.", "Unless this woman was caught in a blizzard in your city with all hotels full, NO! You are NTA.\n\nThe wrongs in your story are many. It was *wrong* of your mom to offer*to offer* your place, it was *wrong* of this woman to expect it, and it was *REALLY wrong* of said woman to approach/shame you at the funeral!!\n\nIf your mom felt soooo bad for this woman, she should've rented an airbnb for her.", "NTA.

YOu just did not let them intrude on you uninvited - a reasonable decission.", "NTA. First off your mother had NO BUSINESS offering your space to people you don't know, without asking you first. Secondly you are not a jerk for not wanting strangers staying in your home. Your mom and her \"friend\" are jerks.....the friend doubly so for confronting you at a funeral of all things. Yikes.", "NTA. That was really rude of your mom to voluntell you that she offered your spare room to strangers. And it was even ruder for that woman to confront you about Your home. Your mom needs some firm boundaries set when it comes to Your condo.", "NTA\n\nAnd that woman was very very rude to come up to your with that nonsense at all, let alone at the funeral.\n\nBut it's your mum who is the AH in offering out use of your condo to people you don't know, without even asking you first. She is definitely the biggest AH in this.", "NTA. Another absolutely true response could have been \u201chi, so nice to meet you.

I would\u2019ve called someone to escort her away and told her to never bother me at my home again.", "NTA your personal residence isn't a hotel, hostel, or rental; your mother was WAY out of line by offering her friends your guest room. The fact you've never met barely has any bearing on my judgement since even if you had known the people, you'd be under no obligation to follow through with your mother's offerings especially since she didn't get your approval beforehand. Your mother needs to check herself since I doubt she'd appreciate you offering her residence up for your friends if they visited her area.", "NTA, you are not running a hotel or BnB.
