My family has a similar rule with birthdays\u2014you get to do whatever you want\u2014but I like the way you phrase it. \n\nNow that I\u2019m married, my spouse doesn\u2019t *love* birthdays but always makes a point to get a card/present for me. I don\u2019t like cake, but I make sure that he gets the sweet he wants!  That\u2019s part of a relationship, a meal/activity is implied and it\u2019s always up to the person.\n\nMy birthday was recent. This year we couldn\u2019t do the activity because I\u2019d just gotten out of the hospital but we have it on hold for a future day. We still made a point to have a little celebration at home and it was wonderful. My partner\u2019s is upcoming and I didn\u2019t do the best for it last year, so this year I\u2019m trying to plan a bit better. \n\nI hope things get better. \nEdit: For me, birthday activities are usually group activities, but sometimes that isn\u2019t the case! Everyone should be allowed to chill if they want a break.", "NTA. Your spouse isn't putting in the work for your birthday. The fact that she's planning things she wants to do during your birthday makes it all the more clear that she  doesn't care.\n\nAs usual, people will blame you here for being upset at your spouse.", "Yes that is the case.", "This. OP added that they don't usually get to do their activity because other things are usually planned. Sounds like OP waits to communicate until it's too late, which is probably the case with gifts as well. As for meal, OP keeps omitting what their meal choice is which leads me to believe it's incredibly specific.", "Why is it immature to ask to be treated the same as everyone else in the family? Why shouldn\u2019t OP also get to choose and activity and a meal? Family isn\u2019t unilateral.", "So by your logic should OP start ignoring their spouses wishes on their birthday?  Or other family members?  If the family has a set way for how they handle birthdays it isn\u2019t ridiculous to ask they get the same treatment as everyone else.", "OP seems to be a dude. I'm guessing you thought OP wasn't because of your princess comment?", "You sound like a pretty miserable person.", "And why aren\u2019t you deciding what to do on your own day instead of being disappointed every single year? At this point after so long you know nothing good that you want to happen/eat will materialize. I would suggest just announce what you\u2019ve decided to do and those who care enough to join can do so, if not then you go and do your own thing AND BE HAPPY ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.", "So here's the thing:  You called shit shit when you smelled it.  You returned 15 years of disrespect with one sentence of angry protest.  NTA.\n\nBut don't try to argue this better with your SO.  Instead, go to somebody outside the relationship (not Reddit!) and talk about it.  Keep a journal and read it often.  Get some perspective from other people and from laying it all out for yourself.  If your SO is just dumb about parties and gifts and this is not part of a larger pattern, there's one course ahead of you.  If this is just That One Fucking Thing among Many Fucking Things that finally eroded a hole through your armor of hope, there's another.", "If the activity doesn't have to mean something for the whole family then I don't understand how this grown adult can't just tell SO/kids that he's gonna go fishing for his birthday in advance. \n\nFor the meal as well, he probably does want something incredibly specific like a childhood dish or \"something his mom makes\" and obviously anything SO makes won't live up to that. Again, I don't understand why he can't just choose something he can be satisfied with instead of insisting on one specific thing every year.", "It depends on whether OP\u2019s requests are reasonable.", "The way the post is written makes it sound as though these were the birthday traditions they had growing up, not ones they have started with their SO. Maybe this is the wrong assumption, but if I'm correct, OP needs to grow up and have a conversation with their partner over what they want their birthday traditions to be going forward together, not get whiny that their partner isn't giving them the birthday they got as a child.", "Sure. Call him a prince, whatever. The sentiment remains the same", "Also, if that's his chosen activity and \"no one else is required to participate\", how do they coordinate a solo fishing date for an adult man? Do they have to call his boss and get the day off for him? Pack him his mom's home-cooked meal to take with?", "Well sure, but how is asking to go fishing unreasonable? And other than choosing a dinner that someone literally can\u2019t eat, even if it is not a favorite of others, suck it up! It\u2019s literally one day a year to show someone how much you appreciate them. Good families do this for each other.", "That was my first impression too.", "Then what is stopping OP from putting fishing into the calendar for their birthday six months in advance to make sure nothing is booked over it? OP seems very passive-aggressive.", "My husband has food allergies that prevent him from eating lasagna, but he still makes it for me a couple of times a year (usually with extras to freeze that I can heat up later) because he knows it's my favorite and he loves me. This isn't even usually for a special occasion, but just because he wants to do something special.\n\nAt the same time, I've learned to make/modify about a dozen meals that are allergy safe for him that I didn't do before we got together.\n\nI know I'm extremely lucky and not everyone has a relationship like this, but I can't imagine being married to someone for 15 years and not trying to figure out how to make their favorite foods."]}
