{"id": 16074, "submission_id": "13420t3", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my stepson my engagement ring because he never treated me like family?", "selftext": "I (49F) have been with my husband Bill (53M) for the past 20 years. Bill had two children from his previous marriage, Jim (31M), and Paige (27F). We also have one biological child together, Harry (16M).\n\nJim's and Paige's mom passed away they were 9 and 5. I met Bill around 2 years after his former wife had died. When I started building a relationship with the kids, I made it clear that I was not going to replace their mom and would be a trusted figure whom they could approach if they ever needed me. That being said, I still made an effort to treat them like I would my own child. I would take them to school, pick them up, take them to doctor's appointments, make their lunches, ask my parents to get them presents for Christmas and birthdays etc.\n\nBoth kids were somewhat hostile towards me at first, which I understand because they lost their mom. However, Paige eventually warmed up to me and saw me as a trusted confidant and maternal figure. She didn't ask me nor did I expect her to want me to adopt her, but she still calls me mom which I appreciate\n\nJim on the other hand continued to be mean and hostile. I have never treated him poorly or antagonized him. Nevertheless, he would make misogynistic statements like \"it's your job as the woman to clean the dishes\" when I would ask him to clean his plate or call me a bitch when my back was turned. My husband told him many times that the way he was treating me was uncalled for and for us to go to family therapy but he always refused.\n\nHe eventually moved out after reaching adulthood. He continues to maintain contact with his father and siblings but its minimal between him and me and even then he doesn't treat me well. Now I have an engagement ring that is a family heirloom for several generations. It is passed down from the mother to the oldest child. My husband got the ring from my mom to propose to me. I told all 3 children about this heirloom a few years ago.\n\nAnyway, Jim currently has a girlfriend whom he intends to propose to. He called me out of the blue one day and asked if he could have the ring. I told him no. When he asked why, I told him it was because of how he has treated me all these years and how he continues to treat me and I don't want my family heirloom going to someone who sees me as vermin. When he asked whom it would go to, I told him it would go to Paige when she gets engaged. When he heard this he lost his shit and accused me of playing favorites. I eventually hung up when he wouldn't stop insulting me and blocked his number. My husband is on my side but his maternal relatives have all been blowing up my phone telling me what an asshole I am.

You are giving it to YOUR oldest child I'm assuming. (Meaning the oldest child that has accepted you as family not the oldest biological child)\n\nNTA he's had plenty of time to grow up and treat you like a real person. If his maternal family is so concerned you should ask them where his mother's family ring is.", "NTA \n\nJim is an entitled asshole, Paige deserves that ring. Your maternal relatives shouldn\u2019t have any input on where YOUR family ring goes. I\u2019m glad your husband is supporting your decision.", " IMO No one is entitled to that ring before you\u2019re ready to take it off. TBH I wouldn\u2019t have thought it would go to either of your step-children as it\u2019s an item from your side of the family, but you obviously have deep feelings for your stepdaughter, while your stepson has made it vividly clear that he is not your oldest child, so NTA", "NTA. He isn't obligated to see you as his parental figure but then he isn't entitled to the family heirlooms. Sounds like you have taken the right approach to being a step-parent and it's unfortunate that he had to antagonize you even into his adulthood.", "NTA he wants nothing to do with you until he thinks he gets a free ring, not only is he an ass he is a cheap entitled ass", "NTA. He\u2019s not treating you as part of the family, so why should he inherit a family heirloom? Easy, he shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s wonderful you\u2019re going to give it to Paige. Don\u2019t let the noise in the back make you think you\u2019re doing the wrong thing, you\u2019re not. They\u2019re more than welcome to contribute to an engagement ring for him if they\u2019re so pressed about it!", "NTA. it's an heirloom from your family, and you're still alive and wearing it I presume. \n\nHow would it even be a question of you just handing it over---even if you had the greatest relationship ever with him?", "NTA.  If his maternal family is calling then tell them to give Jim a ring since that would be more meaningful to him.  They need to not worry about what you do with your family heirlooms.\n\nYour family may have an issue with you giving the ring to Paige instead of your biological child, but that is also your decision to make.", "  'It is passed down from the mother to the oldest child.'. \n\nJim has made it extremely clear that you aren't his mother and he isn't your child.

He sounds absolutely awful and so does your husband for allowing his child to treat you that way. Do not give him your ring. He doesn't deserve it in the slightest.", "NTA!  Not even a little. Sorry i raised 3 step-children and they would never treat me that way unless they were still mentally 14, which they are not!", "NTA. Stand your ground. He\u2019s acting like a child.", "NTA.  Imo, it's your ring.  You can give it to whomever you want, or do with it whatever you want.  As another Redditor posted, if he continues to try to find a way to get your ring, push him into the volcano.  That will resolve the problem.", "Like trust, respect is earned.

This is YOUR family heirloom Not your husbands.  It would\u2019ve never passed down to your husband\u2019s child regardless of your relationship with the children.  Him being an ass just makes it an easier decision.

Heck, I\u2019d even say NTA if you said it was going to your biological child. \n\nJim has been disrespectful to you and doesn\u2019t see you as family, so he needs to go buy his own damn ring.", "NTA I hate this sub for all the times I read about family members taking sides, they are the true AH of this sub. You're not the problem and his actions resulted in this outcome. His actions after learning he won't get the ring should only be more proof that he doesn't like you and just wanted an awesome ring to propose to his girlfriend, a ring that is way out of his price range and he wants to show off.", "NTA. \n\nFrom what it sounds like, you really tried to form a relationship with him and he refused and treated you poorly. You have every right to deny giving him that heirloom even though it\u2019s \u201ctechnically\u201d supposed to go to him, especially since he doesn\u2019t really see you as his mom, why should he get your family heirloom?\n\nEdit: clarity", "NTA\n\n\nTo be honest, he should get HIS MOTHERS ENGAGEMENT RING, why isn't his mothers family providing a ring?\n\n\nI find it odd that he called you for the ring out of the blue. Did he ask your husband about it? Did your husband tell him to call you?  Is he that entitled that he thought you would hand it over?\n\n\nYou're not playing favorites, he chose to verbally abuse you and not have a relationship with you, and then expect you to hang a diamond ring over that is YOUR family heirloom.  It's really nice that you would give it to your stepchildren as opposed to your bio son, some wouldn't.\n\n\nHas his maternal side has been fueling his behavior, they were so quick to jump down your throat.  I know kids can lie, but since step daughter has a totally different relationship with you, they should know that this isn't a YOU issue.", "Nta and I can see where he gets it from - his maternal relatives have no rights at all here.\n\nThat said I thought an engagement ring must be earned by the giver. The person who gives it buys it with their own money as a token of how much they esteem the recipient. If it's just an heirloom it loses that meaning, so Jim is a jackass on two counts - a lazy scrounger.", "NTA. He\u2019s proven time and time again that you\u2019re not his family. \n\nYou also have a SO problem since he\u2019s allowed this to continue for years.\n\nAlso, give the ring to Harry. He\u2019s your oldest bio child.", "NTA. It's your engagement ring and your family heirloom. It's your choice whom you give it to.  That's it. \n\nIt's not favoritism of you to give to Paige, rather an acknowledgement of her acceptance of you and how she has treated you.  \n\nHe has no one to blame but himself.", "Leaning towards N T A.
