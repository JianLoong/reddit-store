{"id": 16074, "submission_id": "13420t3", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my stepson my engagement ring because he never treated me like family?", "selftext": "I (49F) have been with my husband Bill (53M) for the past 20 years. Bill had two children from his previous marriage, Jim (31M), and Paige (27F). We also have one biological child together, Harry (16M).\n\nJim's and Paige's mom passed away they were 9 and 5. I met Bill around 2 years after his former wife had died. When I started building a relationship with the kids, I made it clear that I was not going to replace their mom and would be a trusted figure whom they could approach if they ever needed me. That being said, I still made an effort to treat them like I would my own child. I would take them to school, pick them up, take them to doctor's appointments, make their lunches, ask my parents to get them presents for Christmas and birthdays etc.\n\nBoth kids were somewhat hostile towards me at first, which I understand because they lost their mom. However, Paige eventually warmed up to me and saw me as a trusted confidant and maternal figure. She didn't ask me nor did I expect her to want me to adopt her, but she still calls me mom which I appreciate\n\nJim on the other hand continued to be mean and hostile. I have never treated him poorly or antagonized him. Nevertheless, he would make misogynistic statements like \"it's your job as the woman to clean the dishes\" when I would ask him to clean his plate or call me a bitch when my back was turned. My husband told him many times that the way he was treating me was uncalled for and for us to go to family therapy but he always refused.\n\nHe eventually moved out after reaching adulthood. He continues to maintain contact with his father and siblings but its minimal between him and me and even then he doesn't treat me well. Now I have an engagement ring that is a family heirloom for several generations. It is passed down from the mother to the oldest child. My husband got the ring from my mom to propose to me. I told all 3 children about this heirloom a few years ago.\n\nAnyway, Jim currently has a girlfriend whom he intends to propose to. He called me out of the blue one day and asked if he could have the ring. I told him no. When he asked why, I told him it was because of how he has treated me all these years and how he continues to treat me and I don't want my family heirloom going to someone who sees me as vermin. When he asked whom it would go to, I told him it would go to Paige when she gets engaged. When he heard this he lost his shit and accused me of playing favorites. I eventually hung up when he wouldn't stop insulting me and blocked his number. My husband is on my side but his maternal relatives have all been blowing up my phone telling me what an asshole I am.

He has never treated you like a beloved maternal figure, why should you give him an heirloom that has been beloved by all those who have worn it?", "NTA, he has no respect for you. Why would he even want to give your engagement ring to his fianc\u00e9, if he doesn\u2019t even like you? He is being cheap and continues to be a horrible brat. The maternal side of Jim\u2019s family can pitch in and give him an \u201cheirloom\u201d ring if they are so hot and bothered that you won\u2019t give him yours. Keep him blocked, block the maternal family who are being jerks. Hopefully Jim\u2019s significant other sees his behavior and runs for the hills.. or the Himalayas.", "NTA.

He is of no biological representation to you and at best he is the son of your husband. Not stepson but the son of your husband and there is a difference.

It's your choice of whom to give it to either your stepdaughter who does call you mom or your actual son, Harry.", "I'd lock up that ring good. Nice safe place. Otherwise it might grow legs, you never know.\n\nNTA.", "NTA op.. Jim is a narcissistic bully by the sounds of it.. do not give the ring and tell who ever the family is the truth about the way he treated you", "NTA - he really expects you to remove your ring from your hand so he can use it?  sheesh, how entitled! \n\ntell him no - it's still being used on your hand!", "NTA and I think it is amazing you are even giving it to Paige rather than keeping it in the bloodline family so your youngest son would get it. The oldest absolutely doesn't get it and honestly he's just trying to come off good to his future fiance by using a family heirloom while really just being a cheapskate. An entitled misogynistic one at that. I sincerely hope his attitude isn't towards all women or that he has learned but I somehow doubt that such a long term toxic attitude is fixable.", "The ring should go to Harry.  Paige is not in the OP's bloodline.", "NTA. I'm not sure why his maternal family is even getting involved considering it came from YOUR family. He made it clear he doesn't see you as family so good for you on telling him know and wanting to give it to Paige, who does see you as family. Not only does he sound entitled AF, but also seems to not want to spend the money to get his own.", "NTA.  It\u2019s YOUR ring.", "Nta. It should go to your youngest child who is your bloodline. However, you make the choice. YOUR CHOICE. Your husband should not even have a say.", "LOL.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  \n\nNTA", "NTA OP.  I wouldn\u2019t want an engagement ring of mine to end up in the hands of someone who treated me with hostility.", "Tell everyone harassing you about it to help Jim pay for an engagement ring for his girlfriend.

Go NC with everyone that even dares to try and make you feel bad about this.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and I think it's rather lovely you want your step daughter to have it.\n\nYou would be justified in keeping it for your biological son but you have chosen your daughter despite no blood relationship. You sound wonderful respecting her mother but loving her like she's yours.", "NTa", "NTA. I know your close with Paige but if it was me I would hold onto it for your bio son to give to his girlfriend come time.", "NTA. Some people are just so entitled. How can treat someone who has tried to care for you so awfully and then just expect them to give you their precious family heirloom? \n\nIt doesn't matter if you're the oldest, and that's the way it's gone before if you treat the current owner of said heirloom like cr*p.\n\nAnd his maternal relatives' opinions should  carry no weight in the situation as they are in no way related to you. How entitled do you need to be to think you have a say in this situation.", "NTA.\n\nNext time he accuses you of playing favorites, lean into it.

He can\u2019t treat you like sh*t all these years and then act like nothings happened because he wants something off you. \n\nAnd if his mums family keep blowing you up.

Do they think it was originally the one he gave his first wife? It makes no sense why they would have feelings about this.", "NTA Because it's your family ring and not something from husband's side. Stepson has no claim to it when he couldn't even treat you politely.", "You are 100% NTA.

You have no obligation to pass on an heirloom from your family to a non bio child, that has consistently treated you poorly for years.

How you treat people has consequences. He's not entitled to anything.", "NTA\n\nEven if he was your biological son, I think you would be justified in not giving him the ring after how he treated you. \n\nTraditions aren\u2019t an absolute contract - there is still an expectation of treating people with decency. \u201cI can treat you like shit and you still have to gift me an important sentimental object\u201d is bunk.\n\nAcknowledging that he has treated you badly and withdrawing accordingly isn\u2019t favoritism.", "NTA. Since it is an heirloom from your family it should go to your biological child. It would be different if it was from your husband's family.

What business of it of theirs to say what happens to your family heirloom?", "NTA.\n\nJim fucked around, and has now found out.\n\nAnd revenge, if you wanted it, is a dish best served cold, no?", "NTA\n\nJim is just pissed he will have to pay for a ring himself.\n\nYou are giving to Paige, you're playing favorites. If you said you were giving it to Harry, he would have said you never viewed him and Paige as your family.\n\nHe never viewed you as family, he doesn't get to benefit from it when it's convenient for him.", "NTA - he made his decisions in life.
