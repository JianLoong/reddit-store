I believed they would be taking care of lodging for the bridal party because of the extravagance and location. They said the hotel wanted to charge them extra to book the whole space so we were instructed to book/pay for our own rooms ourselves from Thursday-Monday. \n\nI found out there will be a Shabbat dinner the Friday eve but the bridal party is NOT invited because there is not enough space. The chef will only cater to **50** people...I brought up that this felt rude and unappreciative to the bride, and she understood and said her fiance did not think it was important for us to attend. She discussed this with him again and his response was \"don't they know how expensive these dinners are? We're already providing a rehearsal dinner\"\n\nThe bride later said her fiance and his family (he is Britsh/Swedish/German) don't do Rehearsal dinners. It is not a part of European culture.

I have no problem with this until she expressed that one of her friends said that the bachelorette location is dirty and untasteful. She relayed this to me after I had already planned out the trip.

NTA if you bail, because very few people can afford a luxury like that. And they\u2019re being very cheap hosts. I agree with you. If they make everyone shchlep to Taormina, the least they could do is have at least a couple more activities for the guests paid by them. A welcome cocktail, that Shabbat dinner for everyone, maybe a lunch after the wedding. And the other bridesmaids should have participated in the planning of the bachelorette trip, instead of making your choice look bad. Mean girls the lot of them.

Don't mortgage your future for somebody who would ask this of people. Please don't go.\n\nNTA", "I'm not sure what your question is but YWNBTA if you dropped out of the wedding.  It sounds like a finacial disaster for you.  The smart move is to stay home.", "NTA unless you still go.

Please don't go, because if you do, you will be TA to yourself. \n\nTell her you appreciate her wanting you to be there for her happy day. However, your financial situation doesn't allow you to take a 5-day holiday in Sicily. You understand that if she makes an exception for you, then others might demand the same treatment and you don't want to put her in that situation. You'll help her to the best of your ability and wish her a lifetime of happiness.\n\nNow the part where we don't tell her: if her sister avoids duties then she definitely should not have been made the MOH. You *should* get the special treatment if you're heavily involved in the planning of this wedding. However, maybe there's a prenup you don't know about that prevents her from spending money, so demanding her to do that would be unreasonable of you. Of course, that goes both ways, and it would also be unreasonable of her to ask you to spend a significant amount of money (which you don't feel comfortable spending) on her special day. If a year of unemployment would ruin your life, then you certainly don't have the money to do that (and even if it wouldn't, asking someone to go on a holiday so you can have a destination wedding is also an AH move).", "NTA\n\nIt's frankly absurd that she has the expectation that any normal person without a bottomless bank account would agree to this. She should know what kind of means the people she is inviting have to attend and if she wants all this extravagance in her wedding, plan accordingly. \n\nJust tell her to send you a post card since you won't be there.", "NTA. Your friend is being selfish and unrealistic, and it would be more than reasonable to tell her you are unable to go under her conditions.", "NTA\n\nPeople that want destination weddings should foot the bill for everyone they expect to attend.

After calculating the costs, I've discovered that I truly cannot afford to even attend, let alone be in the bridal party. I wish you well and congratulations.\" If you want to release any planning you have done (bachelorette, etc.) to someone else, do so. Otherwise, let someone else take up the planning and start from scratch, especially since it already seems that all your plans have been scrapped anyway.", "NTA. \n\nIf there are no events other than the wedding, why are they asking you to pay for more than one night at the hotel?  Leaving aside the fact that every destination wedding I\u2019ve ever heard of has more than one event, there is no way you should be expected to stay more nights than YOU want to stay if there aren\u2019t events to attend. (And if there are mandatory events like a rehearsal that require you to be there earlier, then you are absolutely right that there should be a meal provided. In my world I\u2019d say it could even be a very cheap/simple meal, though this bride/groom probs Lu wouldn\u2019t consider that. But some sort of meal.)", "There's always expenses to joining a wedding party. When my best friend go married I paid for my dress, hair/ makeup and hotel. She also did the same for my wedding. We did give each other thank you gifts but that's about it. That being said, 5-8000 is a ridiculous amount of money to spend on someone else's wedding. I'd have an honest conversation that it's not in your budget and you'd love to be able to go, but you're not willing to jeopardize your future to do it.", "NTA- yikes that\u2019s extremely entitled of your \u201cfriend\u201d to assume you can afford all this and then to be blown off to the side in favor of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s wants. This looks like a terrible marriage in the making.", "Shouldn't weddings be an enjoyable experience for all involved?  I'd say save yourself a couple hundred grand and just politely bow out and send a gift or card.NTA", "NTA if you decide not to go. $5000 is a large chunk of money to have just sitting around to spend on something like this that I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather spend on something that will improve your own life. Whatever you do, don\u2019t borrow the money by putting all the bills on credit cards. Plus, you are either giving up a week\u2019s vacation or a week\u2019s pay to do this. \nIt\u2019s one thing if this is your absolute best friend in the world to shell out this much for their wedding but it seems like she\u2019s expecting an awful lot without even considering the financial impact it could have on you.", "NTA unless you give in to their selfish demands. You know there will never be any kind of quo here, no matter what your quid is. Leave these people in your past right now: become #1 on the list of individuals they'll never be able to use again.", "NTA. Holy crap, don't even waste your time and money.", "The only way I would do this is if you turned it into a holiday for yourself and stayed another week or toured around visiting the local attractions.", "Nta. 8k to be in a wedding is inane", "NTA - but this is a pricey affair. Is this something you would be comfortable spending and not be upset with her when it pans out that it will be a lot more expensive? If you don\u2019t quickly come up with a yes I would back out and acknowledge that the expenses are too much for you.", "NAH. They live in Europe already, so regardless their wedding would likely be a destination wedding for you. It is not traditional or expected that the bride and groom pay for the accommodations of guests, so I don\u2019t think you should expect to be compensated in some way. Small token gifts for the bridal party are typical, but not something arranged in advance to inform your plans. \n\nIf the expense doesn\u2019t make sense for you (which would be very understandable), you can politely say you can\u2019t attend. If you want to have your own White Lotus vacation and the wedding will be a part of it, that\u2019s great too.\n\nI get that it\u2019s an uncomfortable situation, but it\u2019s not clear anyone has been an asshole beyond the rude response to the bachelorette party plans.", "Info are you expecting like a salary or to be paid for your time ?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
