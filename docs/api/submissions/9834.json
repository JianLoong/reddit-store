Also, why are you spending the whole week if the wedding is only at the weekend with no other activities planned? \n\nYes, it's insane for you to spend so much money to attend a friend's wedding.

She doesn't sound like a real friend.\n\nThe fiance sounds controlling and this marriage def won't last. The fact that they are being stingy towards the bridal party but are going on a $50,000 safari. RIDICULOUS. And to not include you in the Shabbat dinner, piss off.

We will pay for roughly %50 of the cost.\" Basically the resort allowed us to book a package which A - got the cost down a bit, B - Allowed us to have a fixed cost per person.\n\n3 - We packed the whole wedding in the 3 days of a 6 day trip.

I would nearly guarantee they\u2019ve taken out loans for the wedding and honeymoon or she\u2019s flat out lying.  Of course, they could just be stingy, uptight buttholes.
