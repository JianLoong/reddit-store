His whining on Whatapp makes me feel guilty though.\n\nEdit: Just got off the phone with him, crisis averted! My little brother is just a little frustrated.

You suck because you're responding with incredulity to his very \"typical of a 15-year old\" reaction after you made this decision knowing that he would not want to comply.

If you know a dog bites and you still reach out to touch the dog, whose fault is it that you got bit?\n\nYour brother sucks because he is unable to pretend to be mature for one day and just put on a suit. Your parents suck for even allowing it to come to this.\n\nEDIT: In your original post you don't sound like much of a bridezilla, but after reading your replies to people, you sound self-centered and narcissistic. You wrote, \"It's not just about the photos.

Your brother is 15 and allowed to have an opinion but he\u2019s also old enough to suck it up for one day which, really, isn\u2019t about him at all. He needs to learn this lesson - it\u2019ll certainly help him later in life.", "This wedding sounds awful.  I wanted my guests including wedding party to be comfortable.  Told men to wear any black suite with a blue tie they wanted, told bridesmaids to wear a blue dress.  Guess what?

Stress to him that it is only for one day and that you would be very appreciative of his being able to give you the tux wearing as a gift to you. \n\nIf your brother is not in tge wedding party and is then a guest, even if he is a very close relative,  you need to compromise on the tux and maybe get him to agree to a very nice suit or even a shirt, vest, bow tie combo. \n\nI fear that the line of wearing only a tuxedo is going to cause a normal 15 yr old to rebel and either not attend the wedding or cause so much disruption that your day will not be the happy, peaceful event you deserve. \n\nDoes it suck that your black tie dress code for immediate family is causing such an issue? Yes. Does it suck that your saying you won't exclude guests that don't adhere to the black tie dress code excludes your brother? Yes.

In this case, the consequences of not following the dress code are lost on him.\n\nHow much does he want to attend the wedding? How much does he want to be included in the photos?

He and his friends looked very sharp!  Your brother may be surprised by the selection that is out there.", "NTA. Honestly. Have a chat in person about how much it means to you. Can he wear trainers?
