{"id": 28021, "submission_id": "16xbv6j", "title": "AITA for giving my granddaughter most out of my will?", "selftext": "This is an anonymous account. I\u2019m 65 and terminally ill.  My husband passed many years ago. I have two children, one son named Michael, and another named William.\n\nMichael is very distant and has always been a wanderer. He has not walked a straight path and lives a life with little to no obligations/responsibility. His daughter, Lily (19), is very close with me and is currently working two jobs and going to nursing school. We recently found out that she\u2019s expecting her first child. She has nothing to lean on as her father is mostly uninvolved. Her mother is also estranged and not in her life.\n\nWilliam is the exact opposite of his brother. He\u2019s lived a very admirable, typical life thus far. His stepdaughter (only child) is almost 27 now. She has a very large financial cushion as well as a large family on her mother\u2019s side to fall back on. We are not close and she was never interested in maintaining a relationship with me (she came into our lives as a late teenager and was civil, but not affectionate). I have no ill will for her; she\u2019s a very smart and hardworking woman, but we just don\u2019t have that same bond or tie.\n\nWhen drawing up my will and last wishes I made sure to leave something to everyone. Be it family heirlooms or silly keepsakes, everyone will have something to remember me by. Michael\u2019s stepdaughter will receive vintage books that I know she appreciates as we\u2019ve communicated about it before. She\u2019s very into collectibles and reading. She does not want or need money.\n\nLily will receive most of my savings and money. I do not trust Michael with large sums and William is not in need of it. Lily is very much in debt and struggling, and I know that she would benefit from the boost to eventually buy a house and pay for her child\u2019s needs. This decision was not made lightly and I fully trust her to use the money wisely.\n\nWilliam and his wife do not approve of the decision (not their place, but it is taking a toll on me emotionally). They believe that their daughter deserves more, if not half, of what I\u2019ve decided to give to Lily. Their daughter herself does not care and is grateful for what she\u2019s been allocated for the day I inevitably go. It\u2019s causing a rift in the family and is taking a severe toll on my emotional and physical health. I do not know exactly how much time I have left, just that it\u2019s not much, and this is not how I envisioned my final months going. I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re making plans to try and contest the will when I do pass. I know that there\u2019s no room for such things and that it is bulletproof, but it\u2019s extremely hurtful.\n\nAITA? Could I have divided this any better?\n\nEdit: I did not proofread, listed William as Michael in the last paragraph.

For example, you could add her as your pay on death beneficiary to all of your bank accounts, and make sure she is the official beneficiary to any of your retirement of life insurance benefits (fill out the beneficiary forms the companies require). This way they pass outside of probate. There might even be appropriate deeds you can execute to make sure your home passes strait to her and does not have to go through probate.\n\nAnd stop telling your family about your plans.

Why not help Lily out now? Why not use your current savings to pay off her debt now, while you are still alive or set up a trust for her now? Why wait until after you pass?

She's got my power of attorney in there, too. The kid owns me. Making her legally mine was a better decision, to tell the truth, than marrying her mother.", "From my sister, who's had the \"joy\" of handling my aunt's estate:\n\nHave that paperwork somewhere that she can get it easily and quickly, no matter what time it is. Having a POA or will in the bank doesn't help at 2am on a Saturday.", "We considered that. The various doctors offices have my advance directive, which is more critical than the rest. Ultimately, though, I'll probably have left the country so it'll take weeks to get a foreign death certificate issued, apostilled, and sent over.
