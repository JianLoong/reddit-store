{"id": 28021, "submission_id": "16xbv6j", "title": "AITA for giving my granddaughter most out of my will?", "selftext": "This is an anonymous account. I\u2019m 65 and terminally ill.  My husband passed many years ago. I have two children, one son named Michael, and another named William.\n\nMichael is very distant and has always been a wanderer. He has not walked a straight path and lives a life with little to no obligations/responsibility. His daughter, Lily (19), is very close with me and is currently working two jobs and going to nursing school. We recently found out that she\u2019s expecting her first child. She has nothing to lean on as her father is mostly uninvolved. Her mother is also estranged and not in her life.\n\nWilliam is the exact opposite of his brother. He\u2019s lived a very admirable, typical life thus far. His stepdaughter (only child) is almost 27 now. She has a very large financial cushion as well as a large family on her mother\u2019s side to fall back on. We are not close and she was never interested in maintaining a relationship with me (she came into our lives as a late teenager and was civil, but not affectionate). I have no ill will for her; she\u2019s a very smart and hardworking woman, but we just don\u2019t have that same bond or tie.\n\nWhen drawing up my will and last wishes I made sure to leave something to everyone. Be it family heirlooms or silly keepsakes, everyone will have something to remember me by. Michael\u2019s stepdaughter will receive vintage books that I know she appreciates as we\u2019ve communicated about it before. She\u2019s very into collectibles and reading. She does not want or need money.\n\nLily will receive most of my savings and money. I do not trust Michael with large sums and William is not in need of it. Lily is very much in debt and struggling, and I know that she would benefit from the boost to eventually buy a house and pay for her child\u2019s needs. This decision was not made lightly and I fully trust her to use the money wisely.\n\nWilliam and his wife do not approve of the decision (not their place, but it is taking a toll on me emotionally). They believe that their daughter deserves more, if not half, of what I\u2019ve decided to give to Lily. Their daughter herself does not care and is grateful for what she\u2019s been allocated for the day I inevitably go. It\u2019s causing a rift in the family and is taking a severe toll on my emotional and physical health. I do not know exactly how much time I have left, just that it\u2019s not much, and this is not how I envisioned my final months going. I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re making plans to try and contest the will when I do pass. I know that there\u2019s no room for such things and that it is bulletproof, but it\u2019s extremely hurtful.\n\nAITA? Could I have divided this any better?\n\nEdit: I did not proofread, listed William as Michael in the last paragraph.

But don't be surprised that William and his wife are unhappy.", "YTA for telling these people about the provisions in your will.  You *had* to know it would stir up drama and cause hard feelings, but you just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you?  It's none of their business what your will says while you're alive, so you should have just kept that shit to yourself.\n\nSince it's too late for that, for now you can make sure there are several certified copies in different locations with people you trust, so it can't get \"lost\".", "YTA. \n\nInheritance should be split evenly especially when it comes to nieces and nephews and grandkids.\n\nThis will cause problems with the family later as there will be resentment and envy and jealousy and for good reason.\n\nIf you have a kid that you've been bailing out their entire life and they have got the brunt of help thus far in their life and your other kid did everything right and is now having a successful life. He should be rewarded for making good decisions and being responsible not punished. \n\nYou made no mention of your potential heir being married, but you're saying she is pregnant and struggling with two jobs and an education.\nThis tells me that she is not doing things to help herself either. Perhaps instead of spending your last days on this Earth planning on alienating the heirs, maybe that time would be better spent reaching out to the people and try to develop some kind of relationship with them prior to cutting them off. I don't think receiving some old books is going to soothe the hurt feelings your niece will feel when they learn that their cousin got a sizeable Head start in life despite being irresponsible and getting pregnant without a husband or education.", "NTA. Tell your son to drop it or you'll leave her his portion too. It's your estate. You do what you want.", "Definitely NTA. It is YOUR money and assets, not theirs. They may be upset but you brought up very valid reasons as to why you divided the money like you did. I wouldn't worry about it. Enjoy your time while it's still here. Just ensure the will is sound proof and there is little ground for contestation should your family try and fight it.", "NTA.  Especially if the stepdaughter herself doesn't care.  As you're terminally ill, I'd suggest talking to a lawyer about the legality of removing the money now while you're alive.  You might find there's nothing anyone can do about it if you do it now.  Maybe paying off her debts, buying Lily her baby things, starting an education savings account for the baby or paying for her own college? Those all tend to be quite expensive.  The more money that gets removed now, the less is in your accounts when you die and the less reason they have to fight with Lily and make your death harder on her.  As long as you're legally able to make financial decisions for yourself they shouldn't be able to argue what you spend your money on while you're alive.  Talk to your lawyer to confirm that though.\n\nAlso, my grandmother is getting pretty old and we just moved her.  While we were packing her up to move her this last time, she found it easiest to let things go by giving them to family members.  She specifically picked out the things she wouldn't need at her new place but that were important and handed them out to who she wanted to have them while was at it.  I literally had bags set out in one corner with peoples names on them for her to sort things into and hand over to them when they visited.  That way, when she does go no one can fight over the crystal dresser set, because when she was decluttering for her last move, it was decluttered.  Where she chose to send it to (me in that particular case) is no one's business as it was her choice while she was still mentally with it enough to choose.", "NTA. William\u2019s step daughter is not your blood. I\u2019m surprised anybody expects her to get anything.", "From what I have seen in your statement Lily deserves it the most, but you need to be careful if you could pass a lot of it onto her before you pass away then it will cause less complications for her. If you do pass away because family can be very nasty once you were gone.", "You need to put your foot down and tell your idiot son that he is actively ruining the last moments of your life. Ask him if that\u2019s what he wants to do to his mother. Ask him if that\u2019s his plan. And ask him to actually talk to his daughter, because since she clearly doesn\u2019t care, why is he doing this? What\u2019s his motivation?\n\nNTA.

You are actually being a lot more thoughtful and generous to her by listing exact items that not only are precious antique but items that have real value to her as a tie to the particular bond between you.  You are showing her that you listened to her actual likes and interests as opposed to just listing items that were monetary valuable but would have no interest of her.  Your son and DIL are having sour grapes because they think she is worth more than what you deem appropriate.  And they are wrong as well as being disrespectful of your choices of what you want.  You need to get the will in record with a lawyer ASAP as well as put in record if you can do so ahead of time.  And I hate to insinuate but you may want to get a doctors competency clearance so that they don\u2019t try to say that you were not of clear mind when writing the will.\n\nAnother thing to consider, this is going to be life changing money for your granddaughter.  It may make more sense to set up a trust fund for her and to an extent your great grandchild.  This could potentially protect her from her Uncle William and Aunt do not guilt, bully or trick her out of the inheritance.  Putting it in something ironclad that can only be used for specific purposes and by specific people can stonewall long enough for her to get a plan together, your solicitor ground to stand on to protect your wishes.

It's your money and you can do whatever you want with it. You thought long and hard about how best to distribute it after you're gone, and it sounds like you made the decision that you're confident in. Don't sweat it. The people around you will always want to have a say in what you do with your money. Don't pay them any mind.", "NTA your money, your decision.  Would you be interested in paying Lily's debt or schooling now, so you could be there to help while she's expecting?

Why on earth would you leave half your assets to a step grandchild that you didn't meet until they were in their teens, don't have a close relationship with, and is already wealthy while your direct grandchild is struggling and desperate? The step-grandchild isn't legally related to you and has no claim on your estate. I'm sorry these are the children you got stuck with.", "NTA.  I'm sorry for your diagnosis and applaud you for ensuring your affairs are in order.  Unfortunately these types of reactions are why people are hesitant to make their will known before their passing.  \n\nTell Michael and his wife the will is done.  You're happy with it.  The stepdaughter is happy with it.  They need to channel their inner Elsa and let it go.  You're treating your family equitably, not equally which is a smart decision.  \n\nI agree with the advice saying to add a provision that anyone contesting the will be disinherited.  I'd also see if you can specify a certain portion to go to a financial advisor for Lily.  I'm glad you're helping her, but she's still 19.  Not much experience with money especially a sudden influx.  Clearly she can't rely on her Dad to help her figure out the best way to use her money.  Get someone who can.  If you're able I'd include a list of recommended ones she can choose from. Set her up for success the best you can. I hope you're able to enjoy whatever time you have left.", "NTA, may you rest in peace.", "Your property. Your will. That is your right.

You heard what he has to say and you have made your choice.  Stop the conversation with William when he starts complaining again.  Let your attorney know that William will be making trouble after you pass away so they'll be prepared to handle it.  You can start giving Lily money now, but again check with the attorney about how much you can gift her.  You can start paying her debts now.  William can't complain about what you do with your money while you're alive. Maybe putting Lily's name on your accounts will help ensure she gets what you want her to have.  Again, discuss this with an attorney.  You can try to make sure there's nothing for William to fight about when you pass away.", "In addition to all the other great advice you\u2019re getting, why not pay off as much of her debt as possible while you\u2019re still alive in addition to what you will her?

You sound like a wonderful grandmother to two wonderful young women who not only differ in emotional connection to you, but in life circumstances as well. This is such a well thought out will and it makes my heart hurt that your son is choosing to stress you out instead of fully enjoy your presence during your last months. Honestly, it sounds like he could use a clear reminder about that, and how this is really the most equitable option. You laid it out very clearly in your post - your step granddaughter is 27 with a financial cushion and far more supportive extended family than Lily (none besides you, it sounds like), who also already has debt & is working her ass off in nursing school, two jobs, and growing a baby! \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve seen that people suggested paying off Lily\u2019s debt and what not now if you have the money to spare, which sounds like a great idea! I don\u2019t know how much it is, but if she can afford to take some work time off her plate to spend with you, that\u2019s a win-win all around :) Re: son & DIL - if you\u2019re tired of justifying and explaining, you can always just send them this post because there\u2019s nothing else to say!

Advice from someone dealing with a recent loss: if you're in the US go directly to your financial institutions and set the distribution directly into beneficiaries. It moves the money entirely out of the will/probate process.  It becomes hers the moment they are presented with a death certificate, they will generally cut a check within that same half hour.  That way your granddaughter does not have to wait through a creditor/probate period, and the money will not become one of the assests used to pay any debts.

You are talking about cutting people out of their birthright. Family is all we have in life when it really comes down to it, and when you start splitting up money and showing favoritism it creates a rift in that family that will not get healed. \n\nSo rather than being thought of as a fair loving person, they will be thought of as a callous insensitive person who treated and loved other family members differently and it will make every get together after the funeral strained and quite possibly non-existent. These are all factors to consider when you start treating people differently just because their personalities just happen to align with yours towards your end of life. \n\nWhat they should really do is pass it on to their immediate children and let them pass it on to theirs.
