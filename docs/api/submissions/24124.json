Not even temporarily.", "\"It appears that she believes that will be a forever thing.\"\n\nShe does believe this. You need to discuss this with your partner right away. What happens if you have kids, she'll think it's his job to continue to support her? Nope, your partner should to tell her that she needs to get a job to support herself and that she won't be living with you.", "NTA - having someone move in with you for free with no real long (or short-term) plan is a recipe for disaster. Family or not. It is one thing if you have space, room, and a desire to do so.   \n\nI know cultures are different of course but I would find that impossible to say yes to. You are not married yet either- so you need space, time, and energy to really invest in your relationship. VS having someone in your home, in your space, and in your life that will dictate and run things.  \n\nNah MIL- peace out. She can move to the city and rent somewhere nearby sure... but it sounds like she knows she is overstaying her welcome and needs to leech (or at least invade) the next family member. Especially if its your name on the lease and not his.", "Nta, I would bring your groom to lower contact as mil will only use him again. You are planning your own little family, this can't work with this people in your lifes.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo put your foot down, and don't let them move in. YOu need to tell your partner this is a hard NO, and if necessary tell him you will move out and get a divorce if he moves her in against your will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMIL does not have a job, so she will not contribute, ansd she will never move out again. WHERE would she go? And: everywhere else, she would have to pay - with you it will be like a vacation: free food, free service including cooking, cleaning and laundry - and no worry abourt money, and she will have you two as her servants.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It will probably be ugly, so do not give her any opportunity to come between the two of you.", "You need to do this soon and firmly , because she sounds like the type who will come there knowing that you wouldn't let her suffer by not letting her live with you. She might just show up at your door. \n\nBesides, she doesn't even have a job, her life is already derailed! You need to just put your foot down before she shows up to take advantage of you.", "Well, there is your out. I will bet you somewhere in your lease there is a limit on house guests. Mother in law and brother are not on the lease. You could be evicted for having guests for more than a few days at a time.  It is legitimately, probably not legal for them to stay with you. Aside from that however, you and your fianc\u00e9 need to be on the same page. For me, it would be a hard no about having his family move in but I don't know the dynamics of your Relationship or culture but now is the time to make sure that you are his number one priority, not mommy. That information needs to be clear before you actually marry him you need to know that he is going to choose you. There are only two of you and your relationship.  You need to keep it that way for your own sanity. If he does not choose you now that expect that to change after you get married.", "It\u2019s a two yes, one no situation.
