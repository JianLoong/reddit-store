I see instances all the time where the person standing with the groom is a woman.\n\nMen can stand with the bride, and women can stand with the groom. It really doesn't matter; if that's what the ones getting married want, they can have it.\n\nEven if Jane protested wanting to stand with the groom, she didn't have to take it as far as she did. You didn't uninvite her because you're intolerant of her being trans. You did it because she threw an epic tantrum and threatened to ruin your wedding.", "NTA. Who invites someone who threatens to ruin their wedding with a tantrum?", "NTA. Jane was offered the role of best woman. She is free to decline that role, but she is not free to decide on another role in your wedding. Once she resorted to threats, it sounds like you had no option but to keep her away from the wedding.", "NTA I was the \u201cBest Man\u201d at my Cousin\u2019s wedding and I am a woman. It sounds like Jane is causing problems for attention. She wants to play victim. It is not intolerant of you to disinvite someone who threatened to ruin your wedding because she wasn\u2019t getting her way. \n\nINFO: Would Jane of been permitted to wear a dress in the Best Man role?", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly fine for a woman to be a best man or a man to be a man to be a maid of honor. You can change the title if you want, call her a best woman instead of a best man. The marriage police aren't going to come get you.\n\nIf she really feels like her new gender prohibits her from playing this role, fine, but she doesn't get to *demand* to be a bridesmaid. And she definitely shouldn't be getting aggressive. You are absolutely doing the right thing by uninviting her.", "NTA. Jane is making your wedding about Jane.", "NTA - It is your wedding, not Janes, it\u2019s about you & your husband, not her. \n\nBest man does not have to be a male, ive been at weddings and the best man was a woman so she\u2019s throwing a temper tantrum over absolutely nothing.", "None of the trans thing or bridesmaid/best man stuff matters. What matters is she threatened to ruin your wedding.  That's unhinged, no real friend would do that. \n\nOf course you're NTA for disinviting the asshole who threatened to ruin your wedding. Jane's friends are being ridiculous.", "NTA. As a non-binary person, I could see how Jane might feel uncomfortable with the term \u201cBest Man,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t excuse any sort of threats. The title could easily be changed to something more gender neutral or feminine. When it comes down to it you have to do what\u2019s best for you and your family!", "NTA - no one gets to make demands at your wedding\n\nAs a cis-gendered person I don't really understand where Jane is coming from.  But, trying to give her the best light possible, maybe she feels the traditional roles are extremely important, maybe she feels that as a woman she wants to be a bridesmaid, maybe she feels that her new status as a woman is not being accepted when still being asked to be on the \"man's\" side (even though the fiance wants his best friend on his side).  \n\nIf you want to keep this relationship (and I totally get it if you don't), perhaps you could sit down with Jane and a mediator to have a civil conversation to get at the root of Jane's issues.", "NTA.\n\nWomen can be on the groom's side. My sister was my brothers Best Maid last weekend, while the brides brother was on her side as Man of Honour.", "NTA \n\nJane has an issue with standing with her friend, it seems. Plenty of people have a female \u201cbest man\u201d or male \u201cbridesmaids\u201d (best woman and bridesmen?). \n\nI got married a year and a half ago, my \u201cbest man\u201d was a woman and my wife\u2019s son stood with her as a bridesman.", "I think she was sensitive about being cast in a traditionally male role given her transition. I can't imagine spending decades feeling like you're in the wrong body and having to work so hard in being accepted as who you really are, then having to deal with that on an important day, so I feel for her. \n\n\nAnd then she asked you if she could be a bridesmaid, which would not only give you an extra bridesmaid, it would leave your husband looking for another best man and another groomsman. Talk about adding to the expense of your wedding. \n\n\nBut it was really bad of her to threaten you. I don't think you were wrong to disinvite her. NTA", "ESH, disinviting after threats was the smart move. However, why couldn't she be best woman?\n\nI know there's tradition but it's 2023 can we move on? I've been to several weddings with a woman on the grooms side or a man on the brides side and they were all wonderful events and nobody burst into flames.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why can't there be a best woman? I've been to several weddings that did this. \n\nAlas, this situation has devolved into threats, so it may not be salvageable.
