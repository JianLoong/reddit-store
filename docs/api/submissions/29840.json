I know wedding traditions vary wildly across the globe, but without more details I can only speak from my experience. OP you\u2019ll know if it applies.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I am about to give a possible explanation NOT EXCUSE for Jane\u2019s behavior. It might or might not be accurate, and your fianc\u00e9 would be a better judge of that than me. Even if it\u2019s the truth, whether or not it matters to you is up to you and your fianc\u00e9. It doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior. \n\nMany grooms fill their parties with close male friends and brothers and leave out sisters and close female friends. Many couples make a list of the most important people and then divide them by gender. For example, my boyfriend\u2019s sister is getting married, and my boyfriend is a groomsman even though he\u2019s the brides brother. This is probably why Jane expected/wanted to be a bridesmaid. Obviously you and your fianc\u00e9 aren\u2019t doing things this way and he just wants his best friend standing by his side. \n\nJane is not hearing what he\u2019s saying, or doesn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s the real reason your fianc\u00e9 wants her in his party and not yours. Ideally, she wouldn\u2019t question her best friend\u2019s motives, but if every other groomsman is male and if every bridesmaid is female, I can see why she jumped to a conclusion. Especially if not all of her friends and family supported her transition (which is probably the case even if you don\u2019t know about it). This is clearly something she\u2019s VERY sensitive about and that is understandable considering how trans women are treated by pretty much every society. Maybe Jane feels like her best friend doesn\u2019t really support her after all, and she is so panicked/angry that she can\u2019t see reason. It\u2019s been proven that you can\u2019t learn under a certain level stress, which may explain why she is not seeming to hear what your fianc\u00e9 says.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable for your fianc\u00e9 to be hurt that she doesn\u2019t believe his reasoning and isn\u2019t listening to him. She still has absolutely no right to threaten to ruin your wedding and it\u2019s fair to uninvite her. For pure AITA purposes, uninviting and \u201cunfriending\u201d her is justified. But\u2026. is this really the way your fianc\u00e9 wants things to end with Jane? Does she regularly get extremely angry over minor slights and threaten things like this? Or did this one thing just accidentally hit a deep wound and she said something terrible in anger? If so, is that something your fianc\u00e9 thinks he could forgive or is it too far no matter what the reason is? There isn\u2019t a morally right answer to these questions\u2014it\u2019s just about how you both feel. \n\nIf this fight isn\u2019t unforgivable and you don\u2019t think that Jane would pretend to forgive him just to sabotage your wedding, your fianc\u00e9 could apologize to Jane so she calms down enough to talk. If he hasn\u2019t already, he could gently reassure her that he knows she\u2019s a woman and promise that the position could be called \u201cbest woman\u201d and that Jane could wear a dress. I know a lot of women call themselves \u201cbest man\u201d and don\u2019t care, but Jane clearly does and that\u2019s probably based on her past experiences. You and your fianc\u00e9 could revisit your party lists. If you\u2019ve left out or \u201cswitched\u201d anyone else on the basis of gender, you could change that so that you aren\u2019t treating Jane differently than anyone else. Maybe then she\u2019d be comfortable joining his party.\n\nDo you two \u201cowe\u201d that to Jane? No. I completely understand if your fianc\u00e9 is unable to forgive her for it. But when we\u2019re reminding you that you\u2019re not obligated to take the high road, it\u2019s easy to forget that it usually ends up in a happier place.", "This is exactly why I have a problem with this identity crisis crap going on in our society now.

For example maybe give some thought to long ago Jane transitioned, do you remember puberty with female hormones?  It is a crazy explosive confusing time even under the best of circumstances.  Your husband should wait for this to cool down and then try to have a calm discussion, make it clear he is right that he cannot be a best man as he is not a man, but that he is/was welcomed as a best woman because nothing has/had changed about wanting her by his side.", "\"Jane, formerly Matthew\" , This is the problem right here.

There was also a bridesman among the wedding party. It was no big deal.\n\nThese days, I can't imagine being seriously hung up on being specific genders for specific sides of the wedding party.\n\nWell, I suppose I can - The kind of people who are very traditional/uptight. But like, if you're not ***completely*** beholden to tradition, I don't really see it being any sort of problem.\n\nNow, I'll grant that Jane probably has some particular hang-ups about a traditionally-gendered role. She could absolutely be the best woman, that's where her connection with you and your fiance is - She presumably is (was?) primarily his friend and met you through him - Not a knock against any friendship the two of you might have had - But from the tone of this, you would not consider Jane a close-enough personal friend to have her as part of your side of the wedding party.\n\nBut, like, I could understand her being concerned that people would only see her standing there as best woman and thinking things like \"oh, they just changed it to best *'woman'*\" (the way that should be read in this hypothetical scenario is with full venom - I'm not going actually type out any other hypothetical cruelty to emphasize the point, you can imagine yourself that if you want) - Not that I'm saying any of your friends and family actually are transphobic like that - I don't know them, but transphobia does exist in the world so it's not like Jane's worries come from *absolutely* nowhere. \n\n**BUT**, really, this isn't about what your guests might actually think -  It's Jane's brain being a jerk to herself - And, like, anxiety sucks, and trans people certainly to have a reason to be more anxious in general and cautious about, especially when it come to traditionally-gendered things and how people might react or even just perceive  her and undermine her transition in their eyes, for lack of a better word. And like, performing a traditionally male role might bring up a bunch of discomfort for her personally, triggering dysphoria or whathaveyou. And yeah, that'd absolutely suck.\n\nThat being said, just because she's anxious about all of that doesn't give her the right to demand switching sides on the wedding party. She could still absolutely wear a dress instead of a suit, she could still get her hair and makeup done with any other female members of the wedding party, etc., etc. But still be on the groom's side of the aisle.\n\nAt most, if she was feeling too overwhelmed by everything or was too dysphoric to continue in that role, the ***most*** she could do is ask to step down from the role, without the expectation of any other role in the wedding as a replacement.\n\nShe went beyond the pale when she threatened to ruin your wedding. She further burned the bridges between herself and your fiance by claiming that you had robbed her of her friend.\n\nYou're entirely right to cut her out of your lives - Temporarily until she smartens up and apologizes - If you want to ever accept such an apology - Or permanently as may be sadly necessary.\n\nAs written, it sucks, but Jane handled her concerns poorly and you and your fiance reacted as fairly and as best for yourselves as you could.\n\nIf a friend who was not trans was pulling these kind of stunts, nobody would have a problem seeing how out of line they were.\n\nNTA.", "NTA she still could have been best woman.
