I think gross probably wasn't the best word. Racist asshole would have been a better description. Gross is more like picking his nose or spitting in public.", "NTA. \n\n1) he was racist. \n2) when you got upset about him being racist, he tantrumed\n3) even after acknowledging that he\u2019s racist, he won\u2019t accept that you had a right to object to his behavior \n\nLook, the racism is bad. Between the assumption that a bunch of strangers were Muslim to the towels thing, pretty nasty racism all around. You\u2019re 100% right to be shocked and to *not* just shrug it off. But most people have some unexamined racism cooking under the surface, and poorly considered jokes are one of the main ways it comes out. The joke was **bad**, but doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect deeply held beliefs so much as prejudices he hasn\u2019t unpacked but still could. \n\nBut when you pointed it out, he should\u2019ve said \u201cshit, sorry\u201d or \u201cokay, I won\u2019t say stuff like that anymore.\u201d Idk, something to acknowledge it was messed up and express a willingness to change. \n\nInstead, he got all pissy that you were angry at him, left the shop, and now feels that you started a fight for no reason.

Unchill and unloving behavior, imo. \n\nOnly way for you to be TA in this\u2014and for him to not be\u2014is for racism to not matter.

That is a racist comment, and if not racist it was at the very least OFFENSIVE.\n\nFigure out if you want to stay with him after seeing this side of him.

To me it sounds like him trying to offload how he feels about himself and a flag that he doesn't have a mature way to process this conflict.\n\nI hope you don't apologise for calling him gross.

You called HIM gross and not the comment.\nHe was obviously correct in his thinking, but his choice of words were a touch crass.  You had a chance to reason with him with logic, but resorted to name calling.\n\nIn the Quran it only states women should have their hair covered. The burqa IS garbage, nothing objectifies a woman more than saying her entire being is immodest and sexual so we need to drape her in a damn towel/blanket/sheet.", "they say that the hijab and burqa are freedom of choice. the real question is do they have the choice to not wear it...we all know the answer to that.", "Burqa should be banned, security risk + patriarchal oppression", "Your boyfriend is a moron", "[removed]", "NTA, you were rightfully calling out racism and if he didn't want to hear that he should've kept the comment to himself.", "INFO\n\nOther than stereotypical information of one sort or another (sex, origin, age, some combination thereof), what did you expect him to base his reply to your question on? He had exactly as much certain information as you. I feel like you sort of primed the situation.", "NTA: Neither of you were. The comment alone isnt racist or gross but you have a right to feel how you do about it and to speak your mind. You two together or individually can work out how you feel about it but as a black man in America, I wouldnt consider that racist. You\u2019re not obligated to like or respect a person\u2019s or cultures choice of clothing and they do, objectively, look like they\u2019re wearing one long ass towel. Its an observation and alone is kinda funny\n\nWhat would make that racist is what follows. Did he have a disgusted or hateful look on his face? Did he follow up with some hate speech? Does he not like them? Did he say it to their face? \n\nYou have a right to comment on people\u2019s appearance or make jokes about it, but that works both ways. If he said it looks like a shit stained towel then yeah, that\u2019s racist (brown skin = shit stain). If it was a hoodie and he assumed it was a black guy, again, racist. But Middle Eastern men do give shitty looks to western women because they dont cover up so in the right context, I could see it being a light hearted way of saying \u201cits because you dont follow their culture\u201d. A person\u2019s culture and race do not exclusively go together. Anyone can be muslim and wear Burqas (burkas?). \n\nAgain, context is key and if youve known him for 3 years and he isnt that kind of guy then yeah, no one is the AHOLE.", "Huh? I fail to see how it's a racist comment? Can someone enlighten me? The whole point of covering is to hide certain features. \n\nIt makes perfect sense to me that guys who grew up around nothing but that level of conservative living would be mesmerized by a woman who is confidently being herself and not hiding her more feminine features. The same way men who are conservative in the US who slut shame women are the most rabid purchasers of onlyfans content.", "I mean, fuck the mentality that leads to social pressure to wear full head to toe coverings.

Sure you probably could phrase it better instead of using 'gross', but would your BF accept the criticism or would he still defend himself and said his clearly prejudiced comment was not enough to start an argument? I won't go and say you should break up with him. Maybe you can actually start a positive conversation with him. Ask why his knee-jerk comment was racist (he himself thought it was racist, right)?

This post is devolving into arguments about race and whether Islamophobia is racism and blah blah (it is, race is a construct, and that argument is a straw man to avoid the ugliness of it, but ignore that for now), but *your issue* is that your bf has shown himself to be a racist (he\u2019s not clearly a raging racist to me btw, his comment wasn\u2019t horrific and if he\u2019d take a correction on it that would have been to his credit), fragile person that hates to be called out or held to account, and is highly manipulative. \n\nThis happens.

Not in this case.", "Clothing isn't a race.", "He made the comment about their religious clothing, not their race my point is you are being bigoted if you think only people of Arabic descent can be Muslim.", "My understanding is that the slur refers to primarily Keffiyehs and other head coverings such as turbans, and is not generally about burqas.", "Seems weird to draw such a heavy distinction between racism and Islamophobia, as if the latter isn't often based in a similar hatred of outsiders as racism is, or is all that much better.\n\nAlso, because Islam often overlaps with a particular ethnic group (Arabs), [it is being increasingly considered a form of racism](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/730001/pdf).\n\n>critiquing this way of life is considered racist.\n\nIt's not as if the OP's boyfriend was offering some well thought out critique of Islam. There's a difference between critique and mockery.\n\n>treat women with less rights than literal pigs\n\nGenuine question. Don't people like you often argue that women should take a more submissive and traditional role in the family? Why the sudden switch-up to equal rights feminist now when we're talking about Islam?", "A racist towards a religion\u2026 no fucking shit, like anti semitism has not been the breeding ground and basis of so much \u201crace science\u201d and eugenics?", "absolutely nailed it \ud83d\udc4c", "Sure, but Islam as a religion often overlaps with the Arab ethnic group. Would the boyfriend in the original post have said \"they're used to their women looking like towels\" if a group of white or east asian men walked past?", "Islam is not a race but a lot of Islamaphobia is also rooted in anti-brown racism. There\u2019s a reason Sikh and other brown people have faced Islamophobic attacks despite not being Muslim. There\u2019s\na reason OP\u2019s bf saw brown/arab-looking men and assumed they were Muslim. Things can be multi-faceted.", "This is AITA. Let\u2019s not get into this canard; there are many Muslim women around the Islamic world that choose to wear various forms of dress that\u2019s called \u201chijab\u201d which means to be covered in the Islamic tradition. There are regimes that force women to wear a specific style or covered amount but to call it \u201crarely a choice\u201d in \u201cmost countries\u201d is a slap in the face of all Muslim women who have a myriad desires in how they dress AND exercise that right. Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia are not representative of all Muslim countries, their laws, or their overall attitude towards women\u2019s dress.", "Oh yeah, I should have specified I\u2019m talking about western countries, but it can still be the case.", "Iranian women also would let you know they are not a monolith and that their position is personal women\u2019s freedom to choose what to wear.", "to your first point, i agree. Maybe she should have said\" that comment is gross\" instead of \"you are gross.\"\n\nto the second, i know several women, living in canada, single and independent who choose to wear it. While i recognize it is forced in many places and in many families - it isn't *always* forced. Regardless, the morality of it isn't up for discussion here. The people may not have even been muslim and they may just have been looking at a  pretty woman- ops bf not only assumed their religion but assumed they were looking down on her. That's a whole lot of prejudice and ugliness to unpack without justifying the vileness he spewed.", "You're saying that as though everyone who wears one is forced to.\n\nOP clearly doesn't live in a place where it's the law, so people wearing them might well be doing it because they want to. I know more then one woman who wear it because they want to. they enjoy it; and who am I to tell them they are wrong for it? Regardless- it's irrelevant here.\n\nYou're literally going to bat for a racist dude who *assumed* some random people were muslim and *assumed* that they were looking at his girlfriend because she wasn't wearing a hijab; That's some grody, racist-ass shit; making it about whether or not the niqab/burka/hijab is a good or bad thing entirely misses the point. People *should* be called out when they are making racist assumptions about strangers- thats the real issue. To make it a morality thing about whether or not the Burka is OK is just being an apologist for a racist. Sorry bud.", "And even if the place doesn't require it, plenty of young women in free societies are forced to do so by male family members.", "Have you asked the vast majority of women wearing a burqa if they want to or not? Or did you just not see it as a choice from your own randomly pulled opinion?", "Fair. Do you routinely comment on women\u2019s dress? And if so, in front of them? Again, yikes.", "he displayed a negative bias based on someone based on how they looked. That's racist. He has no idea if they are religion, he is basing bias on appearance", "Religion and race often correlate, therefore racism and religious discrimination often go hand in hand. It makes no sense to pretend that Islamophobia and racism towards Middle Eastern people are two completely unrelated things.\n\nBesides, OP's boyfriend was making a judgment about them based on their perceived ethnicity. It's not like he could see into their brains and know exactly what religious beliefs they hold.", "You are getting off subject. Are you seriously defending/ trying to excuse this behavior?", "But the men weren\u2019t wearing any type of religious clothing in OPs post, he was talking about women from the men\u2019s alleged culture. So you\u2019re wrong in assuming this wasn\u2019t racist. He saw brown men and assumed Muslim", "No one said that, you\u2019re the one making a disconnected comment about that. His comment was racist, because it assumed a race that has nothing to do with that religion either is that religion, or has to be part of it.", "Yes it\u2019s originally about turbans for sure. But the overlap here is definitely\u2026 clear.", "The problem isn't that there are women who live in these places who approve of wearing the hijab. It's the fact that there are women who live in these places who have no option but to wear it or have their human rights violated. \n\nEven in Western countries, the family often times can force a woman to wear one and abuse them if they don't by threatening violence or removal of family support. Since a lot of the times, family is all they're allowed to socialize with, it means completely destroying any structure their life had before they rebuked the societal standards they enforce. \n\nIt's a system drafted for this purpose. This isn't accidental outcomes. It was made this way.", "Hijab =/= burqa. I live in a western city with many muslimahs. Lots of hijab variety. Never seen a woman wearing a burqa.", "And that is exactly why she should have asked him why he said what he said instead of resorting to name calling.  A \"why do think that?\" retort would have made him unpack and think about his response.  But now we have feelings hurt and walls up to what could have been a productive discussion.", "It may not be a law but that doesn't mean its a choice. \n\nDo you really think if a Muslim woman chose to stop wearing a hijab or a burqa that her husband, family, community etc would be \"yeah it's your choice\" or do you think she might experience a little bit of pressure for her to put one of them back on?\n\nReligions aren't perfect and it's not racist to point out when a part of them is utter nonsense.", "Obviously wouldn't matter to them what actual Muslim women think, considering they \"sorry, I don't agree\"d the Muslim woman they were replying to \ud83d\ude44", "You seem hellbound on taking my comment out of context, but to humor you.\n\nNo i do not normally comment on women's clothes, but if i wanted to i should be able to.\n\nThere is no logical reason why i would not be able to comment on any person's wardrobe. I can have my opinion and preference. And i would not say it to that person because i believe they have an equal right to do whatever the fuck they want.", "The exact opposite I am calling out bigots who don't know the difference between Arabs and Muslims.", "He assumed religion not race he never said anything about race.", "Ahh ok. Then my own family must be a total dream right? And my relatives? And of my families friends? And of colleagues and others in my community? All these people who are lying to me, while an imaginary gun is put to their head. Yep, I must be dreaming. You\u2019re right Redditor, thank you for saving me from myself!!", "Nice. Lots of words on outing yourself as a sexist on comments on women\u2019s clothes. Have a nice day.", "Okay and if you look at a group of Arab men and assume they keep women in burqas that is\u2026? Racist, yes!", "He assumed religion based on race. How are you so dense?", "It's clear that you're being sarcastic, but I'm very happy that you haven't been subjected to the kind of treatment that I mentioned in my comment. To sit here and act like your family dynamic is what all women experience that exists in that religious conservative environment is pure confirmation bias. You can do one Google search to prove that fact.", "Sure i did, you keep living in your fantasy narcissist world, nice day to you too.", "No one said they were Arab that's my point you are assuming that they were Arab. You automatically heard Muslim and thought Arab.", "It's like they're actively trying to miss the point.", "In fairness, having a bias does make it hard to see a different view"]}
