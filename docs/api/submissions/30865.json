Between the assumption that a bunch of strangers were Muslim to the towels thing, pretty nasty racism all around. You\u2019re 100% right to be shocked and to *not* just shrug it off. But most people have some unexamined racism cooking under the surface, and poorly considered jokes are one of the main ways it comes out. The joke was **bad**, but doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect deeply held beliefs so much as prejudices he hasn\u2019t unpacked but still could. \n\nBut when you pointed it out, he should\u2019ve said \u201cshit, sorry\u201d or \u201cokay, I won\u2019t say stuff like that anymore.\u201d Idk, something to acknowledge it was messed up and express a willingness to change. \n\nInstead, he got all pissy that you were angry at him, left the shop, and now feels that you started a fight for no reason.

You called HIM gross and not the comment.\nHe was obviously correct in his thinking, but his choice of words were a touch crass.  You had a chance to reason with him with logic, but resorted to name calling.\n\nIn the Quran it only states women should have their hair covered. The burqa IS garbage, nothing objectifies a woman more than saying her entire being is immodest and sexual so we need to drape her in a damn towel/blanket/sheet.", "they say that the hijab and burqa are freedom of choice. the real question is do they have the choice to not wear it...we all know the answer to that.", "Burqa should be banned, security risk + patriarchal oppression", "Your boyfriend is a moron", "[removed]", "NTA, you were rightfully calling out racism and if he didn't want to hear that he should've kept the comment to himself.", "INFO\n\nOther than stereotypical information of one sort or another (sex, origin, age, some combination thereof), what did you expect him to base his reply to your question on? He had exactly as much certain information as you. I feel like you sort of primed the situation.", "NTA: Neither of you were. The comment alone isnt racist or gross but you have a right to feel how you do about it and to speak your mind. You two together or individually can work out how you feel about it but as a black man in America, I wouldnt consider that racist. You\u2019re not obligated to like or respect a person\u2019s or cultures choice of clothing and they do, objectively, look like they\u2019re wearing one long ass towel. Its an observation and alone is kinda funny\n\nWhat would make that racist is what follows. Did he have a disgusted or hateful look on his face? Did he follow up with some hate speech? Does he not like them? Did he say it to their face? \n\nYou have a right to comment on people\u2019s appearance or make jokes about it, but that works both ways. If he said it looks like a shit stained towel then yeah, that\u2019s racist (brown skin = shit stain). If it was a hoodie and he assumed it was a black guy, again, racist. But Middle Eastern men do give shitty looks to western women because they dont cover up so in the right context, I could see it being a light hearted way of saying \u201cits because you dont follow their culture\u201d. A person\u2019s culture and race do not exclusively go together. Anyone can be muslim and wear Burqas (burkas?). \n\nAgain, context is key and if youve known him for 3 years and he isnt that kind of guy then yeah, no one is the AHOLE.", "Huh? I fail to see how it's a racist comment? Can someone enlighten me? The whole point of covering is to hide certain features. \n\nIt makes perfect sense to me that guys who grew up around nothing but that level of conservative living would be mesmerized by a woman who is confidently being herself and not hiding her more feminine features. The same way men who are conservative in the US who slut shame women are the most rabid purchasers of onlyfans content.", "I mean, fuck the mentality that leads to social pressure to wear full head to toe coverings.

While I agree that bodies are not sinful, and that hair is not sexual, if one wants to live their life according to a set of principles without harming others, that's OK too. The act of wearing the hijab or the burqa is not harmful to other people or the public order. The act of not wearing the hijab or the burqa is also not harmful to the public order, so I don't see a point in regulating it or making it a problem. The problem only comes about when you attempt to force your beliefs on others. If a woman in a hijab is trying to make a woman who isn't in hijab wear hijab, that is an issue. While I understand taking issue with certain aspects of Islam (such as the hijab, which I acknowledge is based in problematic norms), I also believe that attempting to curb certain aspects of religious belief because they make you uncomfortable even in the absence of inherent bigotry or social or physical harm to oneself, others, or society as a whole, is its own form of oppression. I feel it bears mentioning that I am not Muslim.", "\"but, but, but, my friend is black so i fully understand the black experience!\" i have ex-muslim friends who have the exact opposite opinion. us having ex-muslim friends does not make us particularly knowledgeable about this subject, as you have just proven. hijab has little to do with sexuality as well but wtvv", "Sure it plays a major role, but discriminating against women who \u201cbelieve it is their choice\u201d because they are raised that way, and they are obligated by their belief system to wear it.\n\nAnd yes there are alot of Muslims women in US and Europe don\u2019t really have a choice when it comes to wearing Hijab or Burqua. Because of family and community retribution. \n\nBut making the assumptions that giving freedom of choice with out any precaution all Muslim women will take Burqua or Hijab of is wrong too. Cause religions and beliefs don\u2019t work that way.", "For real. People need to stop thinking religion protects these traditions. They\u2019re outdated, RELIGION is outdated and unnecessary for humanities growth. I respect the right for people to wear Hijabs and such, still. Because if they have already been indoctrinated and feel more comfortable with themselves wearing them, then I am completely in favour.", "Yes, congrats. Islamophobia is rooted in racism. White muslims are not judged as harshly as brown and Black muslims.", "I really want to hate this comment and disagree with it, but I can\u2019t. You are uncomfortably correct.", "I think a part of the problem is people are not culturally diverse enough to know the difference between Sikh and Muslims, I know I am not.\n\nI'm not particularly interested in either to find out, people can do as they please. I assume that the same thought process is applied in a negative way to some people too, like \"I cbf finding out the differences they are all the same XYZ\"", " Sikh have always been courteous and professional (in my experience). The Muslims, not so much. Perhaps my view is jilted by my girlfriend being harassed by the \"morality police\" in Indonesia. The Muslim faith does not like women.  That being said I think all religion is a bit bullshit. You wanna practice your faith, cool. Wanna live under sharia? Good for you. Just leave me out of your bullshit.", "Sadly had to agree on that.", "Unfortunately, it's pretty clear that antisemitism isn't nearly as universally condemned today as many people seem to think it is.", "Yeah, it would be nice to be critical of a religion without being called a racist.", "Islam doesn\u2019t permit beating women for any reason, and it also allows women to go without covering if their lives are in danger.

Legally there is technically a choice, but there is a lot of pressure from within the religious community to wear it.  \n\nIf you ask a religious woman, ofc she will tell you she chooses to wear it, but the real question is how would she treat a family member or friend who chooses to take it off? How would she herself be treated if she made the choice not to wear it? It's always a \"choice\" until you choose to take it off.\n\nAnd the other thing to ask is that when woman do choose to wear it, why? What is their reason for wearing it? The reasons are usually sexist", "HAHAHAHAHAHA", "Well, shortened or not, there are two areas where she stated he was gross.", "Honor related violence is a thing alot of muslim girls and women suffer from, and denying that fact is pur\u00e9 evil.

Plenty of beatings happen, and religion provides little protection in the real world. \"No true scotsman\" is a fallacy.", "i never denied it.
