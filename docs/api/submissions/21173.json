Good on you for standing up for yourself and knowing your worth after you already offered a very good discount.", "Having a  professional \"in the family\", whether cosmetologist or electrician or plumber or chef, does not mean their service should EVER be taken for granted. It takes work, time, and skill. I can't even imagine assuming that people provide their professional services at no cost because of DNA. \n\nIf I had an electrician in my family, (I can only dream) I would be thrilled to have a discount but would never make their job more difficult. \n\nKudos for knowing your worth!", "I wouldn't say she's TA for wanting to agree on a colour with her husband, it's his day too. It didn't warrant the sarcasm and weddings are stressful. If you wanted to charge you should have said upfront what it is and how much you were willing to discount and/or gift, as it sounds like this wasn't communicated well. \n\nESH because of how she reacted and tried to get the family involved too", "ESH. You for getting snarky for zero reason, and not putting your foot down right from the start when she tried telling you the price she was going to pay. Her for trying to manipulate you out of like $650 worth of work. I worked in the trades and dealt with people like this non stop. They so much as know your name and they want a top notch deal or free work. Best to just say here's the price, take it or leave it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But, my sister has the licence too and she would be absolutely happy to do my makeup and hair as a wedding gift and I would be more than happy to do the photos plus editing for hers too...would be something different if it would be something that would come up often. But for one day / occasion? Why not, I love my sister ... just my thoughts to this post.", "Thank you!!

Plus it would have been a different story if she would have just been up front to begin with  and learned to say no. Instead she just went ahead anyway and was over the top snarky towards an answer that didn't call for snarkiness in the least bit, making her slightly AH.", "I get that's frustrating, and it happens with most weddings where the planning changes multiple times and they can't make a decision to save their lives because they want every detail to be perfect, but honestly if you're planning to do lots of wedding stuff, you should probably get used to it. Although it's different when you're getting paid for the work, so I get it. I dealt with this nonsense in construction too with mind changing and last minute decisions and I had to charge enough to make it all worth it lol", "ESH is everyone sucks here.", "I don\u2019t plan on doing any weddings besides hers \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 she\u2019s doing almost every service I offer. Hair color (for both the groom and her) haircuts for both, eyelash extensions, full face wax, straight razor, hair updo AND extension install and speciality makeup the day of. This also doesn\u2019t include me fixing it up throughout the day like she asked. I gave her a full price breakdown and told her what was set in stone and what would fluctuate depending on how much time we spend on some of the services and she still expected it to be done completely free", "Yeah see I would have just walked away from it and just said it's a take it or leave it deal, no setting her own price. Probably best to not do wedding stuff haha it always sounds like a nightmare from every angle! But yeah I had to learn to be firm with family and friends, because I knew too many people who took a mile when given an inch.", "NTA I am seeing red flags everywhere. The potential problems are numerous. By taking any payment, you would be providing services to a customer. You would not be acting as sisters. So if anything goes wrong, you are responsible just as with any other customer. Also, I am sensing tension between you that would be likely to worsen as the wedding day approaches. It would not be good and has the potential to get messy for life, especially family. I have a few skills that have allowed me to contribute to family and friends weddings in the past. I enjoyed it but was very happy to be a small part of someone's special day. But what they want you to do is a lot more than that. Maybe I am just scared by all the social media posts of bridal dramas and petty entitled people. I think you are making the right choice for your situation.", "NTA\n\nDon't do their hair or makeup.  It isn't worth it.  You can go buy her a crockpot or something for a gift and save yourself the stress.", "NTA\n\nI betting that gifts on her wedding registry aren\u2019t $700 a piece so it doesn\u2019t make sense for you to do this for free, especially if they don\u2019t respect you and your work.", "She said her sister was sitting right next to her fiance in church when she asked her. It never says texted. It never says OP wasn\u2019t sitting right there with them."]}
