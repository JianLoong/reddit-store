My mistake!  \n\n\nThrowaway account.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, my brother, Thomas,\" and his (then) girlfriend moved into our neighbourhood. Thomas started attending the same gym my wife, \"Lia,\" goes to. Lia is incredibly fit, and Thomas asked her if she could train him. She agreed.\n\nThomas trains with Lia 3 times a week. Over the 2 years, you can definitely tell that he's added a lot of muscle and lost a lot of weight. He looks great and I can tell that he's happy.\n\nAs Thomas has improved his fitness, he's gotten a lot cockier. I mean, a lot cockier. He broke up with his girlfriend because he claimed that he was \"too good for her now.\" Every time I see him, he's talking about how women are throwing themselves at him, or how his ideal woman can't weigh over 60kgs (about 130 lbs). It's annoying and it makes everyone, especially Lia, uncomfortable.\n\nLia doesn't train him anymore, but they still attend the same gym at usually the same time.\n\nLia is 6 months pregnant. She still works out 5 days a week, lifts weights (though much lighter), and keeps to her normal regime as much as possible. Because she's pregnant, she can't complete all the exercises, but she is still incredibly fit.\n\nThomas thinks that she's getting lazy. Every time I see him, he makes a snide comment about Lia \"putting on weight,\" or how she's \"acting like a bum.\" To me, these comments don't make much sense. Lia is still incredibly fit and active, even pregnant. On some days, he can barely keep up with her. Nevertheless, his comments are disgusting. Lia calls him out, and I call him out, but he rarely listens.\n\nI don't speak to him much, but Lia does have to see him in the gym.\n\nThomas and my mum came over to our house, completely unannounced. When they came over, Lia was eating a big bowl of carbonara that I had made, and when she offered them some, Thomas immediately started ranting.\n\nRather than just saying \"no,\" or \"I'm okay, thank you,\" he started yelling about how Lia is getting fat, and how she was losing all her \"appeal,\" and if she (Lia) was his wife he'd \"never let her act like this.\" It was shocking and Lia speechless.\n\nI told him to get his \"fragile, chauvinist, insecure\" ass out of my house and never to return.\n\nHe left with my mum.\n\nMy mum is telling me to apologise. Lia thinks I shouldn't have called him names and should have handled it with a lot more tact.", "created_utc": 1670258124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdbqwt/aita_for_calling_my_brother_a_fragile_chauvinist/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So\u2026 there\u2019s that too.", "NTA. - He was being completely out of line. More importantly - he has an unhealthy fixation on Lia and awful attitudes towards women. Your mother is telling him that this behaviour is acceptable. Perhaps consider moving to another town AND another gym.", "Wow. Absolutely NTA. He's a sad, pathetic, insecure guy. His body sounds like it's the only thing he's got going for him and he'd probably lose his mind if he wasn't able to work out. He's definitely shallow and not worth having around your family.", "\"My mum is telling me to apologise\"\n\nWell, no you know who the Golden Child is, at least.

You didn't call him names, you used accurate descriptors to describe his behaviour.", "Your brother wants the wife & family you have.", "NTA but your brother wants to fuck your wife", "NTA You didn't require tact towards a tactless and offensive person. Apologizing would just tell him he's right when he's not.

Your brother can look forward to shallow, dysfunctional relationships of the type that are based primarily on looks.
