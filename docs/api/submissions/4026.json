My mistake!  \n\n\nThrowaway account.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, my brother, Thomas,\" and his (then) girlfriend moved into our neighbourhood. Thomas started attending the same gym my wife, \"Lia,\" goes to. Lia is incredibly fit, and Thomas asked her if she could train him. She agreed.\n\nThomas trains with Lia 3 times a week. Over the 2 years, you can definitely tell that he's added a lot of muscle and lost a lot of weight. He looks great and I can tell that he's happy.\n\nAs Thomas has improved his fitness, he's gotten a lot cockier. I mean, a lot cockier. He broke up with his girlfriend because he claimed that he was \"too good for her now.\" Every time I see him, he's talking about how women are throwing themselves at him, or how his ideal woman can't weigh over 60kgs (about 130 lbs). It's annoying and it makes everyone, especially Lia, uncomfortable.\n\nLia doesn't train him anymore, but they still attend the same gym at usually the same time.\n\nLia is 6 months pregnant. She still works out 5 days a week, lifts weights (though much lighter), and keeps to her normal regime as much as possible. Because she's pregnant, she can't complete all the exercises, but she is still incredibly fit.\n\nThomas thinks that she's getting lazy. Every time I see him, he makes a snide comment about Lia \"putting on weight,\" or how she's \"acting like a bum.\" To me, these comments don't make much sense. Lia is still incredibly fit and active, even pregnant. On some days, he can barely keep up with her. Nevertheless, his comments are disgusting. Lia calls him out, and I call him out, but he rarely listens.\n\nI don't speak to him much, but Lia does have to see him in the gym.\n\nThomas and my mum came over to our house, completely unannounced. When they came over, Lia was eating a big bowl of carbonara that I had made, and when she offered them some, Thomas immediately started ranting.\n\nRather than just saying \"no,\" or \"I'm okay, thank you,\" he started yelling about how Lia is getting fat, and how she was losing all her \"appeal,\" and if she (Lia) was his wife he'd \"never let her act like this.\" It was shocking and Lia speechless.\n\nI told him to get his \"fragile, chauvinist, insecure\" ass out of my house and never to return.\n\nHe left with my mum.\n\nMy mum is telling me to apologise. Lia thinks I shouldn't have called him names and should have handled it with a lot more tact.", "created_utc": 1670258124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdbqwt/aita_for_calling_my_brother_a_fragile_chauvinist/", "score": 444, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is always more than one way to handle a situation. But imo, this was the most necessary choice. Your brother was becoming an arrogant person because of his new attitude in life and blatantly ignored the fact that your wife is PREGNANT not fat, somehow forgetting that pregnant women still need to \"eat for two\". And because she's pregnant, she can't risk hurting herself by working out as hard as she did before, yet he completely ignores that and insults her character because of it. While it's great that your wife helped your brother become healthier, I can't help but feel disgusted at the person he became as a result. While his physical health has been greatly improved, it's clear he still has some internal issues to work on.\n\nAlso, your brother DEFINITELY wants to sleep with your wife. I was prepared to write out how and why, but in the end, it still doesn't justify the way your brother treated your wife. Take some time, and have a serious discussion with her about how you both wish to handle the situation. Then, and only then, should you talk to your brother about his behavior and attitude. I would gently encourage him to seek some form of counseling as it appears he is developing an unhealthy mindset that is affecting his relationship with women and how his preference of attraction towards women is not acceptable and will lead to him becoming a very shallow and hateful person in life.", "NTA!
