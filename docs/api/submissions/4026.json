My mistake!  \n\n\nThrowaway account.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, my brother, Thomas,\" and his (then) girlfriend moved into our neighbourhood. Thomas started attending the same gym my wife, \"Lia,\" goes to. Lia is incredibly fit, and Thomas asked her if she could train him. She agreed.\n\nThomas trains with Lia 3 times a week. Over the 2 years, you can definitely tell that he's added a lot of muscle and lost a lot of weight. He looks great and I can tell that he's happy.\n\nAs Thomas has improved his fitness, he's gotten a lot cockier. I mean, a lot cockier. He broke up with his girlfriend because he claimed that he was \"too good for her now.\" Every time I see him, he's talking about how women are throwing themselves at him, or how his ideal woman can't weigh over 60kgs (about 130 lbs). It's annoying and it makes everyone, especially Lia, uncomfortable.\n\nLia doesn't train him anymore, but they still attend the same gym at usually the same time.\n\nLia is 6 months pregnant. She still works out 5 days a week, lifts weights (though much lighter), and keeps to her normal regime as much as possible. Because she's pregnant, she can't complete all the exercises, but she is still incredibly fit.\n\nThomas thinks that she's getting lazy. Every time I see him, he makes a snide comment about Lia \"putting on weight,\" or how she's \"acting like a bum.\" To me, these comments don't make much sense. Lia is still incredibly fit and active, even pregnant. On some days, he can barely keep up with her. Nevertheless, his comments are disgusting. Lia calls him out, and I call him out, but he rarely listens.\n\nI don't speak to him much, but Lia does have to see him in the gym.\n\nThomas and my mum came over to our house, completely unannounced. When they came over, Lia was eating a big bowl of carbonara that I had made, and when she offered them some, Thomas immediately started ranting.\n\nRather than just saying \"no,\" or \"I'm okay, thank you,\" he started yelling about how Lia is getting fat, and how she was losing all her \"appeal,\" and if she (Lia) was his wife he'd \"never let her act like this.\" It was shocking and Lia speechless.\n\nI told him to get his \"fragile, chauvinist, insecure\" ass out of my house and never to return.\n\nHe left with my mum.\n\nMy mum is telling me to apologise.

If she's building a family with you, then she can't do it with him.\n\nHaving said all of this, it doesn't mean that your brother is a creep.  He, with your wife's help, worked hard at becoming what he views as being a better man.  He's more confident, and cocky.

The OP\u2019s husband stated his wife was his SIL and her kids were theirs, if I remember correctly either the SIL was preggo or gaining weight and he was super upset abt it.", "Even if that could be his thinking, I doubt it with how many men accuse their own wives of getting overly fat due to pregnancy when that's just not the case. \n\nAnd his mom clearly enabled him to think this way.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He might let more assholery show around the brother because of that thing assholes do where they think they\u2019re part of a silent majority. The mother and Lia are just not exposed to it. If he\u2019s too far gone to realize Lia is pregnant, that implies he\u2019s willing to vocally contest reality right in front of him because he\u2019s too mentally fragile to cope with it.

I am concerned for Lia\u2019s safety given the escalation of unhinged behavior around her eating. As well as the mom coddling such abhorrent behavior. She\u2019s had two kids. Surely she remembers that required her eating more food to create the good brother and the AH.", "Especially considering lia spends a good amount of time in a week at the gym.
