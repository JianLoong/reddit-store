My mistake!  \n\n\nThrowaway account.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, my brother, Thomas,\" and his (then) girlfriend moved into our neighbourhood. Thomas started attending the same gym my wife, \"Lia,\" goes to. Lia is incredibly fit, and Thomas asked her if she could train him. She agreed.\n\nThomas trains with Lia 3 times a week. Over the 2 years, you can definitely tell that he's added a lot of muscle and lost a lot of weight. He looks great and I can tell that he's happy.\n\nAs Thomas has improved his fitness, he's gotten a lot cockier. I mean, a lot cockier. He broke up with his girlfriend because he claimed that he was \"too good for her now.\" Every time I see him, he's talking about how women are throwing themselves at him, or how his ideal woman can't weigh over 60kgs (about 130 lbs). It's annoying and it makes everyone, especially Lia, uncomfortable.\n\nLia doesn't train him anymore, but they still attend the same gym at usually the same time.\n\nLia is 6 months pregnant. She still works out 5 days a week, lifts weights (though much lighter), and keeps to her normal regime as much as possible. Because she's pregnant, she can't complete all the exercises, but she is still incredibly fit.\n\nThomas thinks that she's getting lazy. Every time I see him, he makes a snide comment about Lia \"putting on weight,\" or how she's \"acting like a bum.\" To me, these comments don't make much sense. Lia is still incredibly fit and active, even pregnant. On some days, he can barely keep up with her. Nevertheless, his comments are disgusting. Lia calls him out, and I call him out, but he rarely listens.\n\nI don't speak to him much, but Lia does have to see him in the gym.\n\nThomas and my mum came over to our house, completely unannounced. When they came over, Lia was eating a big bowl of carbonara that I had made, and when she offered them some, Thomas immediately started ranting.\n\nRather than just saying \"no,\" or \"I'm okay, thank you,\" he started yelling about how Lia is getting fat, and how she was losing all her \"appeal,\" and if she (Lia) was his wife he'd \"never let her act like this.\" It was shocking and Lia speechless.\n\nI told him to get his \"fragile, chauvinist, insecure\" ass out of my house and never to return.\n\nHe left with my mum.\n\nMy mum is telling me to apologise.

Grandiose with a superiority complex, sure, but fragile? Nah. It is akin to calling a thin person fat, and just devalued your intellect in your brothers eyes(so now he thinks your an \"idiot\" and will more likely then not, ignore anything you say in the future, even more.).

I highly doubt your brother has much empathy for others, coupled with his continuous inappropriate behavior, your kind of an AH for allowing him to continue to stress your wife out, especially while she is pregnant.   \n\n\nYour brother was insecure, before he got into shape. Out of his insecurity and vulnerability, he may of behaved in the past. Now that is gone, your seeing your real brother.

If he is targeting everyone, then it is elitist chauvinism.  \n\n\nGiven that your mom is telling you to apologize given the absurdity of the situation, I'm guessing your brother was the \"golden child\" that always got more?
