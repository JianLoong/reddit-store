My mom has always been very close to me and she\u2019s always the person I turn to during times where I can\u2019t handle my emotions because I have psychological issues. \n\nRecently, she has been under stress because we have been moving and a lot of crap with our housing and her family has been going on.\n\nFast forward to today. My mother while at breakfast announces that she is going on a cruise that was offered to her for free, and tells us the days. I\u2019m already not comfortable when she leaves because I do not feel as comfortable in the care of my father nor his parents but that\u2019s another issue. I tried to be happy but then I realized that the day I get my decision from my dream college is smack dab in the middle of that week. I told her and she responded with \u201cI just ask that you open it with someone close to you\u201d, and I just shut down and went in my room.\n\nIt hurts because I want my mom to be there and I don\u2019t want her to miss this core moment and it\u2019s important to me. Plus if I don\u2019t get in, I have nobody to turn to and lean on as I would my mother. But I don\u2019t want to be selfish and stop her from doing something that could relieve her stress. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for clarifying, I knew I probably would be and I did kinda need the reality check. I should also clarify that the college is doing emails, not letters, so it won\u2019t be postponed or anything like that. Which doesn\u2019t change anything, but yeah.\n\nSecond update/ info: I haven\u2019t guilted my mom, I made sure that she didn\u2019t see me upset because as I said before I don\u2019t want to ruin her fun. Secondly, father and fathers parents don\u2019t believe in mental illnesses. They tend to treat me like an outcast, and have hidden my meds on multiple occasions. This would explain me being so anxious about being left with them.\n\nFinal edit: Thank you for all of your comments (the helpful ones), my overall solution is just to bring the situation up with my therapist at my next appointment. That way I can discuss ways to have the conversation about how I feel without making it seem like I\u2019m guilt tripping her into anything. I honestly want her to go on the trip, but I also want her to be there. For the comments calling me coddled, I have had a helicopter mom most of my life and she is amazing but I admit I am very sheltered. Maturity is needed, and maybe handling the decision alone will be the first step in that.", "created_utc": 1672435013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzbsaa/aita_for_wanting_my_mom_to_turn_down_a_cruise_to/", "score": 514, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gently asking, if you're not comfortable with her away for a week, how are you going to be okay in college? Her life cannot revolve around your needs forever, she needs to have a life too. And I'm sure she deserves this cruise, yes? So let's be the grown up teenager-almost college student we need to be successful, and be happy for her too! The letter can wait for her to return if it's really necessary she's there. But this may be a good chance for you to begin to learn how to pull away and grow up a bit on your own two feet.", "YTA. What if the decision is delayed and your mother turned down a cruise for nothing? \n\nShe'll be there for plenty of milestone moments, she doesn't need to be there to open a letter.

You should consider a local school.", "YTA\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle your mom being away while you open a letter how in the world are you going to survive being away at college? \n\nIt\u2019s past time that you learn to handle stuff on your own.", "YTA \n\nSoftly. But your Mum deserves to go on the cruise she has been offered for free. \n\nPlease go and hug her and tell her that going on the cruise is what you want for her!\n\nYou can FaceTime her when you open the letter. Don\u2019t take away a week of relaxing for a stressed Mum. She will resent you. You will resent yourself when you see that you can do this on your own. You will be off to college on you own soon. You can do this!\n\nGood luck", "Yta. You can't use your mum as a security blanket that's not fair to you or her. She deserves to take advantage of something offered to her.", "YTA.

You are well old enough to take care of yourself, no?\n\nAre you sure you're ready for college?", "YTA and are being selfish about this situation.

She needs and wants this. Let her have it.", "YTA if you actually try to stop her from going, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t wait until she gets back to open the letter. you should start working on your independence as well!", "YTA. You\u2019re being very selfish and not considering your mothers feelings at all. Let her spend time and enjoy  herself without the pressure and anxiety that family brings. \nIt honestly sounds like she needs some time away from you, considering she asked you to open the letter with someone close to you.\n\nIf it\u2019s that big of a deal then postpone opening the letter until she returns. Think of all the times she\u2019s had to postpone or give up something to accommodate you.\n\nStop being selfish and get ready to face this new chapter of your life.", "YTA Think about what your mother wants and needs for a change. She's been there for you for nearly 2 decades, now be there for her by supporting her. You can open the college letter with her when she gets back. Going to college is a time to start developing some independence take this opportunity for starting that process", "YTA. I understand the letter is important to you, but that's a very silly reason to miss out on a cruise. What would you think if she asked you to skip a really exciting trip just because SHE was expecting some important news? Think about how that sounds.\n\nIf you really want to share the moment with her, then make arrangements to Facetime while you open it.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't postpone your life for other people.  I'm talking to you as a person and I'm talking about your mother, who is a person in her own right beyond being your mom and emotional support.  She's allowed to have likes and dreams and hobbies and activities of her very own and to pursue them.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for her and asking her to ~~postpone~~ give up her thing for your thing is selfish (edited since postponing isn't an option for her).  It's especially selfish considering that a) facetime and skype exists, b) it's a 30 second moment compared to a multiday vacation, and c) your thing can be postponed.  Just because you get the notification on a certain day doesn't mean you have to open the notification that day.  You can exercise some restraint and delayed gratification to wait a few days for your mother to come back if it's that important to you.", "YTA for expecting her to give up a nice trip. How are you even going to survive college if you\u2019re not grown up enough to do anything without your Mom there? Or is she going to have to give up her life to live in your dorm with you and attend classes with you as well?", "YTA wait to open the letter if it\u2019s that important your mother is there for it.", "YTA - I mean not a big one, and I do get it. It\u2019s just an unreasonable ask for the situation. It\u2019s super exciting and I\u2019m not downplaying it, but I don\u2019t think most people see the literal opening of acceptance letters as a core moment that needs to be shared, move your schedule around. You could wait to open it until your mom gets back ?", "YTA\n\nPart of growing up is learning to deal outside of the nest. Time to make like a baby bird and try your wings, and opening that college letter (if it even gets to you on time) without Mom around is a great and low-threat first step.\n\nOr, just save the letter until she gets back.", "YTA Your mum obviously needs a break, she won't always be there for you and you are going to need to learn to deal with things on your own. You probably don't want to wait to open the letter but it is always an option right?", "If she is gone for just one week, and you are expecting the letter half way through her cruise, why not hold onto the letter for 3 days or so until she arrives back home?  Win, win all around. \n\nShe gets her cruise, and you get your Mom when you open it\n\nAdded note, there is no guarantee that the letter will arrive during that week also, could be delayed in the Mail. And then your Mom would have missed out of a free cruise for naught", "YTA. You\u2019ve gotta learn to cope without your mom.", "YWBTA if you asked her not to go for this reason.

What are you going to do if you do get in to college and need to move?", "YTA. Mom has a life too and needs to be fully relaxed to handle everyone else\u2019s emotions. Plus how often does she get offered a free cruise.", "You can wait for her to come back and then open it if her being there is important to you.", "YTA. You are about to be on your own at college. You will not have your mom with you when you get important emails or letters. You need to learn some self-sufficiency.", "YTA. Become more mature and be happy for your mother.", "YTA- why can\u2019t you open the letter when she returns?", "YTA\n\nWhy can't you just open it when she gets back? It's still gonna say the same thing whether you open it the day you get it or a few days later. Also, how are you planning on going to college if you can't even handle getting a letter without her being there?

If you are waiting on a college letter....wow.....are you independent enough to attend....or do you expect Mommy to come with you?   YTA....your mother is allowed a life beyond caring for you.", "YTA. Open the letter over FaceTime or something! You\u2019re about to be a legal adult, so it\u2019s time you learn to share your life\u2019s most emotionally charged moments with people you care about without being codependent.

Good luck out there on your own.", "YTA. Like other people have mentioned, if it's so important for her to be there, wait until she gets back.

Read it to her over the phone. YTA.", "Soft YTA.  I understand that you're super close to your mom and that this us important for you.  However Moms need a break too and a free cruise is the perfect way to unwind.", "YTA - no one really cares if you get into your dream college. It's best you learn that now. It's one of life's most important lessons. i.e., at the end of the day, your accomplishments really only matter to you. Everyone has their own BS, even your parents.", "YTA", "YTA for prioritizing your mental health needs over your Mom's. She matters, too. Caring for a child going through those issues is draining on her as well. Apologize profusely, and now is a good time to start growing up and getting over yourself. You are almost and adult and her life is no longer going to revolve around you. As it shouldn't.", "Hugs, your anxiety is real and does impact how you perceive stressors. But at the same time it sounds like your Mom also is struggling with stress and has a wonderful opportunity to do some self care on a free trip.\n\nThis is a an opportunity to use your skills to manage without her in anticipation of going away to college next year. Your Mom is right, plan to have someone with you while you open it and what you will do after irregardless of the results. \n\nYTA- to allow your anxiety to have your Mom miss this opportunity. You know she supports and cares for you even if not physically with you", "YTA", "I understand that this could be a big moment for you and your life, but why would you deprive your mom of a vacation for a letter? YTA", "YTA. You think you\u2019re moms life revolves around you. It doesn\u2019t.", "Gentle YTA. How about you being there for your Mom once in a while.  In this case that means being a big boy for once and acknowledging she has all the needs and desires and hopes and dreams that anyone can have. She has given to you constantly for 17-18 years.  Your college choices are out of your hands now, you\u2019ll get what you get. This trip for her is not reproducible. It\u2019s a one shot deal. She doesn\u2019t have to physically be by your side holding your hand does she? If so, not sure how you will manage in college but ignore the notice until she gets home. Show some love and selflessness to the person you have described as most important in your life.", "YTA if you keep nagging her.", "YTA, but in the mildest of ways because I can sense your anxiety at the prospects of opening this letter without your mom.  However, your mom has been given a wonderful opportunity and you have described that with the amount of stress she has been under that this would really be good for her.\n\nYou are going to have to make accommodations.  Please consider a couple of ways that you can deal with this issue, including:\n\n* Find your next best support person after your mom that will be willing to be in your presence \"in person\" when you open your letter.  \n* Talk to your mom about whether she could attend virtually via FaceTime when you open the letter.\n* Consider picking a time in the evening that works for everyone . . . you, your 2nd in command support person, and your mom that if you get the college letter, you can open with everyone present.  It may mean that the letter sits on the table for a few hours until then.\n\nHave a plan about how the 2nd support person will support you in person should you get bad news, so that person is not left feeling as though they disappointed you in their support, and didn't know how your mom would do things.  You might have to explain to this person what type of stuff your mom does to make you feel better in similar situations.  I know that it won't be the same, should that happen, but let's have positive vibes that it won't be necessary in the first place!", "YTA", "YTA. She has her own life too. Get use to it.", "Why don\u2019t you FaceTime her?", "Soft YTA. \n\nAs many others have already said, your Mom sounds like she deserves a little R&R. And a free cruise?! That's amazing for her!! \n\nAlso, you are hoping to go to college. When you attend college, you are an adult. Your successes and failures are your own. If you can't fathom getting a rejection without your mom, I'm afraid that college may be tougher than you can handle. But, I think you can do it. I really do.\n\nSo, take this first step to being your own individual, and be happy for your mom. And I hope you get wonderful news from college.", "I don\u2019t think anybody is an Asshole in this situation but just think to yourself, \u201chow often is my mom gonna get to go on a free cruise\u201d what\u2019s gonna happen with your letter is gonna happen no matter where she is and she\u2019s not gonna be gone forever. Plus if you\u2019re going to college you don\u2019t really require someone to \u201ccare\u201d for you, this is kinda one of those moments in life where you should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and say \u201chey it sucks but it\u2019s happening. And also make sure not to take it out on your mom, especially if she\u2019s been as good of a mom as you say, you can be happy for her and sad she won\u2019t be there at the same time, it\u2019s how you react that defines whether or not you\u2019re an asshole and so far, as you\u2019ve described it, you didn\u2019t react too badly", "I\u2019m not sure if I can really say that YTA but you are getting to the age that you need to understand adult behaviour. I wish you so much luck getting in to college and I hope it all goes well but if you have been through a lot with your mum it means that she has been through a lot with you too. She deserves to get a time out too. Timing isn\u2019t convenient but life works that way. You can hold off opening the email if you can call her before you do but by the sounds of things she has worked really hard for you and you should give her a break too. Tell her you love her and she deserves a trip away and no matter what happens with your acceptance it sounds like she will still be there for you always.", "If you're this upset that your mommy won't be there for you to open an acceptance letter, then you are in no way emotionally mature enough for college. I can understand this kind of behaviour from someone half your age, but in your late teens? No. It's immature and selfish, and is placing your wants ahead of her needs/joy. YTA. Grow up.", "Long answer: Yes.", "Yta sorry kiddo, if you're *going to college* then you're going to need to get used to a pare nt not being there.  \n\nCan you video chat with her when you open it?", "YTA. Are you sure you're ready for college?", "NAH.  \n\nShe is still there to support you, she just may not be right beside you.  She needs some emotional relief too and it's in the form of this cruise.  Once you get into college and are going to be far away, a lot of moments like these are going to happen.", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re mom seems like a very caring a devoted mother. But you are nearly an adult (assuming 17/18). You need to try your best to not be so emotionally reliant on her. Especially when she has already sacrificed so much for you. Would you really be happy with yourself if your mom turned down the time of her life for you? Let her live", "Soft YTA because you are young and learning this shit. If you wanna double down and be super ice cold cool how about this: Read the email on your own when it comes. If it's good news call her up and gush about it down the phone/facetime. Her well earned cruise that she's looking forward to will be elevated even more and she'll feel epic! If it's bad news, tell her when she gets back.", "YTA \n\nIf you\u2019re having this much anxiety over the letter, do you really think you\u2019re ready for college?", "I'm gonna say NAH, bordering on a light YWBTA. It's clear that you have a hard time with trusting and have a limited support system around you, and that it centers greatly around your mom. \n\nI know that the knee-jerk reaction you feel is to be upset because you really want your mom to be there for a stressful and emotional moment for you. That doesn't mean it's fair to ask your mom to give up an amazing trip that she sounds like she really needs right now.\n\nIt may be difficult, but if you can manage to wait to open your email/letter from the school(s) you applied to until she returns at the end of the week, you can still experience that with her. You can also try to meet half-way and facetime the evening that you open it.", "NAH, but....\n\n1. Insist that your mom does go on the cruise, even if it takes a bit of planning. She might rethink things as the date gets closer or if she sees you struggling. If you're ready for looking at colleges, you're ready to start showing some care and support back towards those who care for and support you.\n\n2. Might be time to check in on your therapy and treatment plan. (You DO have a therapist helping you learn to manage your issues, right?) College is a huge life transition. If you're concerned about being able to manage hearing the decision, you will definitely need to make sure you have good supports outside of your mom as you go to college.", "YTA.

Put yourself in her shoes, she has her own mental well-being as well as your own riding on her and from reading other people's comments about your father, it appears like she is the only one who is understanding of what you are going through. She can't help you if she doesn't take care of herself. So as much as she does support you, you need to support her.\n\nGoodluck and I hope you get the response you are hoping for from your emails!", "Sadly I don't see it. OP sounds really fragile in general. Do you really think they could handle going away?", "Wow, we both got downvoted into oblivion. I forget how insane AskReddit is about the standards you have to have in order to be an \"adult\"", "They hide her meds and discount her mental illness", "I have a therapy appointment soon so I\u2019ll probably bring this up in the session and get her help figuring it out, thank you for your advice and good wishes though!", "That wasn't up when I commented. It would have been useful.", "Yeah I figured it was before the update. Just letting you know \ud83d\udc99", "Can't you just wait to open the email until your mom is back?? And if it's going to stress you out to see it in the inbox, let your mom change the password so you won't have the access to it until she's back.", "Just wait to open your letter until mom gets back. She gets her cruise. You get her there to support you in the way you desire. Nothing requires you open and respond immediately.", "YTA - you could schedule a Zoom when you open it. Tbh I have virtually no memory of my \u201cletter\u201d. I think I just glanced at it and stuffed it back in my backpack.", "YTA and being very selfish. How do you think you\u2019re going to survive college if you can\u2019t even open a letter without your mum? She\u2019s not going to be on campus everyday helping you.", "Listen, there's something that may help you in the situation and in the future:  \n\\- expecting for good news: let other people live  \n\\- expecting for mildly bad news (like just not being accepted this year in the college): let other people live  \n\\- you are about to undergo surgery or a very painful treatment: you can ask them to stay  \n\\- you are about to give birth: unless you are literally popping the baby right now, let them live  \n\\- somebody's life is in danger or  the person just died: then you can ask them to cancel their trip. Depending on the circumstances, they might say no, but most times they will stay and help you.", "No one is the AHole. But please let your mom go with no guilt. And there\u2019s probably a good reason your dad isn\u2019t going either.", "I don\u2019t know why people make a huge deal over college admission letters. Sure it sucks to get rejected but it\u2019s really not a big deal. There are always other schools that provide you the same opportunities academically and socially. YTA for letting it shake you enough to the point that you try and ruin other people\u2019s plans", "YTA but I also completely understand you. I also am super close to my parents and my over dependence on them has caused tension. Your mom probably wants the best for you and wanted to be there on that day but is doing something for her own mental wellbeing. Are you in any way close with others that aren\u2019t your father and his family? Cousins, friends in or out of school, older siblings? It may not be exactly the same but if you have anyone else you respect and ask advice from generally, maybe be with them when you open your decision day. Tell your mom that you\u2019re so happy for her cruise and can\u2019t wait to tell her what college you were accepted into when she\u2019s back, who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll get into a lot and be spoiled for choice!", "This may feel like a big deal right now, but in all reality opening an email is not a defining moment of your life and it\u2019s not going to matter in your life. The answer matters, but you going to/graduating college are way bigger milestones and actually matter as opposed to this.", "YTA. I feel a little bad saying so but you're getting old enough you need to stop leaning quite so hard on other people to manage your emotions for you. You do have another parent, too, even if he isn't your favorite right now.", "Op said her dad has hidden her meds bc he doesn\u2019t believe in mental illness. So I can kinda see how that would not be a healthy environment, whereas hopefully a dorm wouldn\u2019t have that issue. Op should get a lockbox for them tho. For school too.", "Update says they\u2019ve hidden her medications before, truly heartbreaking. I think everyone\u2019s right about the letter, but these people do sound unsafe to OP.", "OP is going to college in a few months, where there will be no mommy at her side.  OP will go through big ups and downs in her first year living without parents.  Time for her to find her own strength in herself.", "A friend of a friend of mine in their early 30s was very close with his family to the point where, when their parents moved back to Asia to retire, they also moved with them. \n\nThey never lived away from their family and as far as I know, they were born and raised in the country I live in.\n\nThey seem to be doing fine there but I still thought it was such a major move to make.", "Stop with the good mom shit, you're not a superior parent for not devoting 100% of every moment to your child.\n\nI would hope OP would regret not sending her mom on the cruise in the future.", "Good parents raise kids who can be increasingly independent in age-appropriate ways. Like opening letters.", "Yes it is terrible having to do it alone, we all want our mothers.\n\nBut reality is not always kind. Out mothers are there own people with there own lives, wants and needs. I actually have  better relationship with my mom 6 years after moving out. Not because she was any less then a good mother, but because we are more equal now. I see her as a fully fleshed out person rather then a figurehead in my life to nuture me.\n\nOne day you are going to have to tough it out. The sad thing with mothers is that they aren't forever. You need to learn to cope on your own before you have no choice but to.", "In my day we needed to call, repeatedly, and a recorded message would tell you whether you were in or not. The letter would arrive much later.  \nI was able to call, I was in, but I pretended to not know so my mother could dial from her work and listen to the message herself, which made her happy", "FaceTime her when you open it. Sorry but YTA if you ask her to turn down this cruise. Believe me, talking as a mam, it\u2019s exhausting. My two are just little (both under 6 and have 6 allergies between them and are both awaiting assessments for SEN. There\u2019s not much that I get done without having to sacrifice some part of it for my kids. I\u2019d walk through fire for them but god I need a break at times. If I was your mother and I saw what you wrote here I\u2019d be feeling guilty about going on a much needed break and I\u2019d cancel. Please don\u2019t do this to her. Just FaceTime her or postpone opening the email until she\u2019s back.", "YTA you are selfish too. You can open the e-mail together through facetime or not open the e-mail at all until she comes back. Grow up girl. You won\u2019t survive college if you cannot survive this day without your mom.", "Damn, people these days are so fragile and lack empathy for others, even their family, thinking only about how they'll feel", "Just face time her or wait", "It\u2019s your acceptance letter, not graduation.", "Eh... Go on the cruise with her and open your email with her.", "Reading your edits, you\u2019re a soft AH. As your mum has given you time to process that she won\u2019t be there when you receive the email, this gives you time to emotionally prepare a little bit that you may have to look at the decision on your own if you don\u2019t have anyone else.\n\nI think you both need to slowly rip that Band-Aid and be a bit more independent from each other.", "YTA have you heard of facetime or zoom? Sheesh. It is not like she is missing your graduation or taking you to college. Her physically standing there will change nothing. She can be equally supportive on facetime. If you can't handle this how to you plan to attend college without her there?", "YTA. College is a scam. Go get a job", "While I understand your opinion, it\u2019s not that my father and his family aren\u2019t my favorite, they just simply make it hard for mentally to function. They hide my medication and just are simply bad people in general. I have thought about just being by myself, we do not have any close family out here.", "Also you sound old enough to sort your own meds out now. If you really believe your dad would hide them, hide them yourself first. That\u2019s a whole other issue though if your dad is hiding your meds \ud83e\udd2f", "I actually already have one, I work at Walmart. But I need a college degree for my desired career.", "Certainly if she's old enough to go to college! Unless she's planning on bringing her mum with her??", "You forgot to add /s", "Can you get more of your meds before she goes without them knowing, and hide them yourself first? I'm thinking you could get an early prescription and just leave out the old bottles for them to hide. Meanwhile, you'll have your new bottles under the mattress or whatever.\n\nIt is utter bullshit that they are doing this to you. Has your mom ever talked to them about it?", "I think I\u2019m going to try that, maybe just hide them in my bags or something. My mom has tried to speak to my father on multiple occasions and tell him that the meds are a necessity, but he continues to believe that he knows what\u2019s best and that it is \u201cpoisoning me\u201d. Most of the time I only go over his house if needed."]}
