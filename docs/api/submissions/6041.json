My mother while at breakfast announces that she is going on a cruise that was offered to her for free, and tells us the days. I\u2019m already not comfortable when she leaves because I do not feel as comfortable in the care of my father nor his parents but that\u2019s another issue. I tried to be happy but then I realized that the day I get my decision from my dream college is smack dab in the middle of that week. I told her and she responded with \u201cI just ask that you open it with someone close to you\u201d, and I just shut down and went in my room.\n\nIt hurts because I want my mom to be there and I don\u2019t want her to miss this core moment and it\u2019s important to me.

AITA?\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for clarifying, I knew I probably would be and I did kinda need the reality check. I should also clarify that the college is doing emails, not letters, so it won\u2019t be postponed or anything like that.

Gently asking, if you're not comfortable with her away for a week, how are you going to be okay in college? Her life cannot revolve around your needs forever, she needs to have a life too. And I'm sure she deserves this cruise, yes? So let's be the grown up teenager-almost college student we need to be successful, and be happy for her too! The letter can wait for her to return if it's really necessary she's there. But this may be a good chance for you to begin to learn how to pull away and grow up a bit on your own two feet.", "YTA. What if the decision is delayed and your mother turned down a cruise for nothing? \n\nShe'll be there for plenty of milestone moments, she doesn't need to be there to open a letter. OR you could wait until she returns to open the letter, if you receive it before she returns.", "Yes, YTA. Let your mother be happy. Also, if you are not able to process the acceptance/rejection from your dream college without your mother, do you really think you're ready to attend that dream college?", "YTA.\n\nIf you can't handle opening the letter, or being rejected if you do open the letter, then just don't open it until she gets back.\n\nNot sure how you will be able to manage going to college if you can't even open a rejection/acceptance letters without your mother present. You should consider a local school.", "YTA\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle your mom being away while you open a letter how in the world are you going to survive being away at college? \n\nIt\u2019s past time that you learn to handle stuff on your own.", "YTA \n\nSoftly. But your Mum deserves to go on the cruise she has been offered for free. \n\nPlease go and hug her and tell her that going on the cruise is what you want for her!\n\nYou can FaceTime her when you open the letter. Don\u2019t take away a week of relaxing for a stressed Mum. She will resent you. You will resent yourself when you see that you can do this on your own. You will be off to college on you own soon. You can do this!\n\nGood luck", "Yta. You can't use your mum as a security blanket that's not fair to you or her. She deserves to take advantage of something offered to her.", "YTA.

You are well old enough to take care of yourself, no?\n\nAre you sure you're ready for college?", "YTA and are being selfish about this situation. While I can sympathize with your anxiety, if you are getting college admissions letters, then you are old enough to invest in developing better coping mechanisms.\n\nEdit: If this core moment is really one that you truly must share with your mom, you can also wait until she gets back.", "YTA.   She needs and wants this. Let her have it.", "YTA if you actually try to stop her from going, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t wait until she gets back to open the letter. you should start working on your independence as well!", "YTA. You\u2019re being very selfish and not considering your mothers feelings at all. Let her spend time and enjoy  herself without the pressure and anxiety that family brings. \nIt honestly sounds like she needs some time away from you, considering she asked you to open the letter with someone close to you.\n\nIf it\u2019s that big of a deal then postpone opening the letter until she returns. Think of all the times she\u2019s had to postpone or give up something to accommodate you.\n\nStop being selfish and get ready to face this new chapter of your life.", "YTA Think about what your mother wants and needs for a change. She's been there for you for nearly 2 decades, now be there for her by supporting her. You can open the college letter with her when she gets back. Going to college is a time to start developing some independence take this opportunity for starting that process", "YTA. I understand the letter is important to you, but that's a very silly reason to miss out on a cruise. What would you think if she asked you to skip a really exciting trip just because SHE was expecting some important news? Think about how that sounds.\n\nIf you really want to share the moment with her, then make arrangements to Facetime while you open it.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't postpone your life for other people.  I'm talking to you as a person and I'm talking about your mother, who is a person in her own right beyond being your mom and emotional support.  She's allowed to have likes and dreams and hobbies and activities of her very own and to pursue them.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for her and asking her to ~~postpone~~ give up her thing for your thing is selfish (edited since postponing isn't an option for her).  It's especially selfish considering that a) facetime and skype exists, b) it's a 30 second moment compared to a multiday vacation, and c) your thing can be postponed.  Just because you get the notification on a certain day doesn't mean you have to open the notification that day.  You can exercise some restraint and delayed gratification to wait a few days for your mother to come back if it's that important to you.", "YTA for expecting her to give up a nice trip. How are you even going to survive college if you\u2019re not grown up enough to do anything without your Mom there? Or is she going to have to give up her life to live in your dorm with you and attend classes with you as well?", "YTA wait to open the letter if it\u2019s that important your mother is there for it.", "YTA - I mean not a big one, and I do get it. It\u2019s just an unreasonable ask for the situation. It\u2019s super exciting and I\u2019m not downplaying it, but I don\u2019t think most people see the literal opening of acceptance letters as a core moment that needs to be shared, move your schedule around. You could wait to open it until your mom gets back ?", "YTA\n\nPart of growing up is learning to deal outside of the nest. Time to make like a baby bird and try your wings, and opening that college letter (if it even gets to you on time) without Mom around is a great and low-threat first step.\n\nOr, just save the letter until she gets back.", "YTA Your mum obviously needs a break, she won't always be there for you and you are going to need to learn to deal with things on your own. You probably don't want to wait to open the letter but it is always an option right?", "If she is gone for just one week, and you are expecting the letter half way through her cruise, why not hold onto the letter for 3 days or so until she arrives back home?  Win, win all around. \n\nShe gets her cruise, and you get your Mom when you open it\n\nAdded note, there is no guarantee that the letter will arrive during that week also, could be delayed in the Mail. And then your Mom would have missed out of a free cruise for naught", "YTA. You\u2019ve gotta learn to cope without your mom.", "YWBTA if you asked her not to go for this reason.

What are you going to do if you do get in to college and need to move?", "YTA. Mom has a life too and needs to be fully relaxed to handle everyone else\u2019s emotions. Plus how often does she get offered a free cruise.", "You can wait for her to come back and then open it if her being there is important to you.", "YTA. You are about to be on your own at college. You will not have your mom with you when you get important emails or letters. You need to learn some self-sufficiency.", "YTA. Become more mature and be happy for your mother.", "YTA- why can\u2019t you open the letter when she returns?", "YTA\n\nWhy can't you just open it when she gets back? It's still gonna say the same thing whether you open it the day you get it or a few days later. Also, how are you planning on going to college if you can't even handle getting a letter without her being there? Even if it's a local college and you live at home you'll have to go to class without her.", "How old are are you?  If you are waiting on a college letter....wow.....are you independent enough to attend....or do you expect Mommy to come with you?   YTA....your mother is allowed a life beyond caring for you.", "YTA. Open the letter over FaceTime or something! You\u2019re about to be a legal adult, so it\u2019s time you learn to share your life\u2019s most emotionally charged moments with people you care about without being codependent. Also, if you really care about your mom, you\u2019ll let her do something that makes her happy.", "You\u2019re going to college soon but \u201cdon\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d in the care of your father? Good luck out there on your own.", "YTA. Like other people have mentioned, if it's so important for her to be there, wait until she gets back.

Read it to her over the phone. YTA.", "Soft YTA.  I understand that you're super close to your mom and that this us important for you.  However Moms need a break too and a free cruise is the perfect way to unwind.", "YTA - no one really cares if you get into your dream college. It's best you learn that now. It's one of life's most important lessons. i.e., at the end of the day, your accomplishments really only matter to you. Everyone has their own BS, even your parents.", "YTA", "YTA for prioritizing your mental health needs over your Mom's. She matters, too. Caring for a child going through those issues is draining on her as well. Apologize profusely, and now is a good time to start growing up and getting over yourself. You are almost and adult and her life is no longer going to revolve around you. As it shouldn't.", "Hugs, your anxiety is real and does impact how you perceive stressors. But at the same time it sounds like your Mom also is struggling with stress and has a wonderful opportunity to do some self care on a free trip.\n\nThis is a an opportunity to use your skills to manage without her in anticipation of going away to college next year. Your Mom is right, plan to have someone with you while you open it and what you will do after irregardless of the results. \n\nYTA- to allow your anxiety to have your Mom miss this opportunity. You know she supports and cares for you even if not physically with you", "YTA", "I understand that this could be a big moment for you and your life, but why would you deprive your mom of a vacation for a letter? YTA", "YTA. You think you\u2019re moms life revolves around you. It doesn\u2019t.", "Gentle YTA. How about you being there for your Mom once in a while.  In this case that means being a big boy for once and acknowledging she has all the needs and desires and hopes and dreams that anyone can have. She has given to you constantly for 17-18 years.  Your college choices are out of your hands now, you\u2019ll get what you get. This trip for her is not reproducible. It\u2019s a one shot deal. She doesn\u2019t have to physically be by your side holding your hand does she? If so, not sure how you will manage in college but ignore the notice until she gets home. Show some love and selflessness to the person you have described as most important in your life.", "YTA if you keep nagging her.", "YTA, but in the mildest of ways because I can sense your anxiety at the prospects of opening this letter without your mom.  However, your mom has been given a wonderful opportunity and you have described that with the amount of stress she has been under that this would really be good for her.\n\nYou are going to have to make accommodations.  Please consider a couple of ways that you can deal with this issue, including:\n\n* Find your next best support person after your mom that will be willing to be in your presence \"in person\" when you open your letter.  \n* Talk to your mom about whether she could attend virtually via FaceTime when you open the letter.\n* Consider picking a time in the evening that works for everyone . . . you, your 2nd in command support person, and your mom that if you get the college letter, you can open with everyone present.  It may mean that the letter sits on the table for a few hours until then.\n\nHave a plan about how the 2nd support person will support you in person should you get bad news, so that person is not left feeling as though they disappointed you in their support, and didn't know how your mom would do things.  You might have to explain to this person what type of stuff your mom does to make you feel better in similar situations.  I know that it won't be the same, should that happen, but let's have positive vibes that it won't be necessary in the first place!", "YTA", "YTA. She has her own life too. Get use to it.", "Why don\u2019t you FaceTime her?", "Soft YTA. \n\nAs many others have already said, your Mom sounds like she deserves a little R&R. And a free cruise?! That's amazing for her!! \n\nAlso, you are hoping to go to college. When you attend college, you are an adult. Your successes and failures are your own. If you can't fathom getting a rejection without your mom, I'm afraid that college may be tougher than you can handle. But, I think you can do it. I really do.\n\nSo, take this first step to being your own individual, and be happy for your mom. And I hope you get wonderful news from college.", "I don\u2019t think anybody is an Asshole in this situation but just think to yourself, \u201chow often is my mom gonna get to go on a free cruise\u201d what\u2019s gonna happen with your letter is gonna happen no matter where she is and she\u2019s not gonna be gone forever. Plus if you\u2019re going to college you don\u2019t really require someone to \u201ccare\u201d for you, this is kinda one of those moments in life where you should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and say \u201chey it sucks but it\u2019s happening. And also make sure not to take it out on your mom, especially if she\u2019s been as good of a mom as you say, you can be happy for her and sad she won\u2019t be there at the same time, it\u2019s how you react that defines whether or not you\u2019re an asshole and so far, as you\u2019ve described it, you didn\u2019t react too badly", "I\u2019m not sure if I can really say that YTA but you are getting to the age that you need to understand adult behaviour. I wish you so much luck getting in to college and I hope it all goes well but if you have been through a lot with your mum it means that she has been through a lot with you too. She deserves to get a time out too. Timing isn\u2019t convenient but life works that way. You can hold off opening the email if you can call her before you do but by the sounds of things she has worked really hard for you and you should give her a break too. Tell her you love her and she deserves a trip away and no matter what happens with your acceptance it sounds like she will still be there for you always.", "If you're this upset that your mommy won't be there for you to open an acceptance letter, then you are in no way emotionally mature enough for college. I can understand this kind of behaviour from someone half your age, but in your late teens? No. It's immature and selfish, and is placing your wants ahead of her needs/joy. YTA. Grow up.", "Long answer: Yes.", "Yta sorry kiddo, if you're *going to college* then you're going to need to get used to a pare nt not being there.  \n\nCan you video chat with her when you open it?", "YTA. Are you sure you're ready for college?", "NAH.  \n\nShe is still there to support you, she just may not be right beside you.  She needs some emotional relief too and it's in the form of this cruise.  Once you get into college and are going to be far away, a lot of moments like these are going to happen.", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re mom seems like a very caring a devoted mother. But you are nearly an adult (assuming 17/18). You need to try your best to not be so emotionally reliant on her. Especially when she has already sacrificed so much for you. Would you really be happy with yourself if your mom turned down the time of her life for you? Let her live", "Soft YTA because you are young and learning this shit. If you wanna double down and be super ice cold cool how about this: Read the email on your own when it comes. If it's good news call her up and gush about it down the phone/facetime. Her well earned cruise that she's looking forward to will be elevated even more and she'll feel epic! If it's bad news, tell her when she gets back.", "YTA \n\nIf you\u2019re having this much anxiety over the letter, do you really think you\u2019re ready for college?", "I'm gonna say NAH, bordering on a light YWBTA. It's clear that you have a hard time with trusting and have a limited support system around you, and that it centers greatly around your mom. \n\nI know that the knee-jerk reaction you feel is to be upset because you really want your mom to be there for a stressful and emotional moment for you. That doesn't mean it's fair to ask your mom to give up an amazing trip that she sounds like she really needs right now.\n\nIt may be difficult, but if you can manage to wait to open your email/letter from the school(s) you applied to until she returns at the end of the week, you can still experience that with her. You can also try to meet half-way and facetime the evening that you open it.", "NAH, but....\n\n1. Insist that your mom does go on the cruise, even if it takes a bit of planning. She might rethink things as the date gets closer or if she sees you struggling. If you're ready for looking at colleges, you're ready to start showing some care and support back towards those who care for and support you.\n\n2. Might be time to check in on your therapy and treatment plan. (You DO have a therapist helping you learn to manage your issues, right?) College is a huge life transition. If you're concerned about being able to manage hearing the decision, you will definitely need to make sure you have good supports outside of your mom as you go to college.", "YTA.

We all have emotions. Emotions are normal. Learning to regulate your emotions at college and in life is a must! \n\nLet your Mum enjoy the cruise. She sounds stressed!", "Oh, wrap your lips around my furry marble bag. \n\nSome people need help. This person clearly does.  You're making it difficult for people that need help by suggesting they're OK. \n\nThey're not. \n\nPeople should feel better about asking help, but people like you keep enabling them.", "YTA - Let your mom enjoy her cruise.  No doubt, she'll find time to call you from the ship.  When you get the email, save it until she calls you (or if her cell service works, call her) and make the discovery together.  Wanting her to pass on a free cruise, while she's under heavy stress, to help you open the fucking mail...smh.", "YTA. Grow the hell up and let your poor mother have a little fun.", "Gently YTA. If you can\u2019t stomach the thought of opening the email without your mom, then don\u2019t! When it arrives, put it a folder and open it when she gets back, or if it\u2019s coming to an email you have for this specific purpose, just don\u2019t check that email until she returns.", "yta\n\nwhy has nobody mentioned that you can check online? edit: just saw the update", "YTA.  Wait until she\u2019s back.  Open the emailed letter together.  Hope you get the virtual confetti and acceptance the way they do it now! Good luck, let your mom enjoy her needed vacation without guilt or stress\u2026she can\u2019t help when it is!", "YTA and hopefully someday, sooner rather than later, you will realize the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "College decision letter? Lol you are out of your mind", "unrelated but i love ur username. i prefer the reddit generated ones myself but yours is funny", "Lol \ud83d\ude02 wowwwwwwww I can\u2019t", "INFO \n\nI\u2019m more worried about you being forced to take care of your dad and grandparents! What does that mean? What do you have to do?", "Your mum CLEARLY needs a break, maybe *from you*. If you rely on her for everything, at your age, it's really not fair. Time to cut the umbilical cord. YTA", "Sounds like you've got your judgement but I'm happy to add to it: YTA. You seriously think even for two seconds your mother should skip a free cruise so that she can be there when you check an email? You do realize that all the things you do at this dream college will be done alone by you, an adult, not with mommy at your side?", "Gentle YTA.  Moms need emotional and time away to be their own identities to.  You will always have new life events they you will hope to have her there for but a free cruise is a huge deal and it sounds like she is a good mom who deserves to have a small moment be about her", "YTA, you are going to need to find a way to function without mommy being with you at all times. If you're that anxious about the letter wait to open it until she gets back!", "YTA I won't be as gentle as the others. If you can't handle your college acceptance letter how are you going to cope with college itself?  You have a lot of growing up to do. You are being very selfish  by guilting your mother about the cruise.", "YTA\n\nAre you sure you're ready to go away for college?  It really sounds like you aren't.", "Softly YTA.  Now if you were saying she was missing your graduation I\u2019d say moms TA.  This is a big moment but it\u2019s one in a series of big moments you\u2019re going to have.  Mom is allowed to have big moments for herself too and a free cruise is a big moment.  \n\nOn another note- you going off to college is a big thing for her too, I can guarantee it.  My heart ripped into a million pieces in my daughters senior year knowing she was leaving me.  I won\u2019t even talk about the mess I was driving away from her college campus that first day.  But as parents our job is to get you to these milestones.  It will be huge for you.  It will be huge for her.  She may spend some time on that cruise processing the fact that you are going on to bigger things.  Let her take that time and know that it sounds like she\u2019s your biggest supporter and loves you beyond belief.  \n\nAnd I hope you get into your dream school.", "YTA. If you want her there that much, wait until she gets back to open the letters if that doesn't negatively impact your chances of going to that school. Let your mom have this, you're almost an adult.", "Why do you need to be with your father while she\u2019s gone? Surely you\u2019re old enough to be home alone?", "YTA\n\nShe's been given a cruise for \\*free\\*. Keep a sense of proportion. (I was about to write \"opening a college acceptance notice is not a Hallmark moment, but maybe that's a bit hasty; I remember where I was when I got an acceptance to Stanford! Still, when you're weighing the two, the cruise wins.)", "YTA\u2026your mom deserves a break. To fuss about your dad and grandparents taking care of you while she\u2019s gone is ridiculous. If you\u2019re old enough to get into college, you\u2019re old enough to handle spending a week without your mom. \n\nHopefully you\u2019ll get to call her with fabulous news and both of you will have great weeks.", "YTA and I\u2019m a little worried for you going to college if being separated from your mom for a week gives you anxiety. Though our parents are our parents, they deserve their happinesses in life too. Let her live.", "F you admin. \n\nYou're also the kind of person that ignores red flags and wonders why neighbor go of and shoots people.", "I had a crushing college admissions response a few years back. \n\nI also had a couple of even worse experiences while at uni that I had to deal with for the majority of the time alone. I had evenings and outings with family and friends during this time but I also had coursework to do and the dreaded moments of trying to sleep. \n\nIts an important life skill to learn. And like you say, if you can't handle the admission process part you are going to struggle with the rest of it", "FaceTime, video calls, and streaming in general are usually blocked on cruises, even on the best internet packages. I have heard the Facebook video chat sometimes works, though, since they are not blocking social media sites. On my last cruise, I saved my calls for days in port when I knew I had cell service and data.", "Also, why does op need to be with the father while she\u2019s gone? Surely op is old enough to be home alone?", "I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how she going to handle the pressure of a competitive university", "That sounds like code for they treat her poorly.", "Um, the applicant certainly cares if he gets into his dream college, and his family may, too.", "and I\u2019ll add that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t stay as a matter of helping you with anxiety, she\u2019d be feeding into it and that\u2019s not how you treat anxiety. You need to fight your own battles with your anxiety, its yours. Start taking ownership of your own mental health, she cannot be your solution forever.", "You mean she's not out on pause when OP's not around?", "Well said, all these comments coddling the OP while simultaneously calling the OP sheltered gave me a good laugh.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "I'm sorry that you had that experience, and hope things have gotten better for you!", " I understand that you're super close to your mom and that this us important for you.", "But how much caretaking is involved at this point?", "My jaw dropped at the part where they said they're not comfortable in the care of their father. If they're college bound the are at least 17, how much care can they possibly need?", "I\u2019ll bite it off. \n\nNo one said they were okay js that this situation in particular isn\u2019t that extreme and they can figure it out, they mentioned that they have psychological issues so I\u2019m sure they know they\u2019re not ok. Ain\u2019t nobody enabling. \n\nYou thought you was helping?", "You're the kind of person that ignores red flags and then wonders why your neighbor shoots someone.", "You\u2019re the neighbor. But I been knew when you said sum weird shit bout yo fuzz marble bag\ud83d\ude2d I support lgbt tho\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 #ally", "Jebus... where did you go to school? \n\nYou should go somewhere else you illiterate monkey. \n\n\"But I been knew...\"?\n\nYour DNA shouldn't perpetuate."]}
