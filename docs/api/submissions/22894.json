Taunting you because you're not grieving 'correctly'? I'm so sorry about your mom and even sorrier you're stuck with him as your only remaining parent.", "NTA. First off: I'm sorry for your loss.  \n\nYou will process your grief in your own way and in your own time.  Your dad (and others) have some preconceived notion of what your grief should look like and he is trying to force you into fitting his mold. He deserves what ever kind of response he gets, even if \"he means well\". You are not on stage to give everyone a handy \"poor little orphan child\" to pet over, for him or anyone else. \n\nAs for all those well meaning busy bodies: just say  \"I'm still processing.\"  For your dad,  ask him to arrange a grief councilor for you rather than him making his lame attempts to force you to grief to expectations.", "NTA\nNo one has a right to tell you how to grieve. I think the honest answer is you feel more comfortable grieving in private. Tell your father you simply don\u2019t have a relationship where you feel comfortable sharing your grief. He isn\u2019t allowed to compound it, you lived it the last year. Sometimes with prolonged illness there is some relief when the end comes because of the weight of care and the end of suffering. Tell him he wasn\u2019t there for the long process. You have been mourning her death for her entire illness and sometimes when the grief is so large opening the floodgates can be to much especially with someone else if you are private with your emotions. Honestly your outburst makes sense and I\u2019d add WTF is wrong with your dad to poke at you like this?", "NTA in the slightest. It's not your dad's place to govern your emotions.\n\nAnd I am deeply sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. I reacted the sage way when my beloved grandfather died. I couldn\u2019t cry. I was in shock and tried to be strong for my mum. Then, two days later, my mum asked me if I wanted to go to the funeral, that was 6 hours away. I said now. She asked me calmly, \u2018are you sure sweetheart\u2019? I said \u2018\u2019mum, I can\u2019t\u2019 and the tears came flooding in. I didn\u2019t cry until his memorial service 40 days later. But during the service, I couldn\u2019t stop crying for hours. You grieve in any way that\u2019s best for you. Just look after yourself any way you can. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry about your mum. You take care of you. And imo, even if you are an asshole today, it\u2019s ok and everyone should understand why. Especially your dad.", "NTA. You aren't a performing monkey and your grief isn't an entertainment show", "NTA\u2026i am alot like you. A bit stunned at first and usually focused on getting through it. The tears come later\u2026every one handles tragedy in their own way and there is no right or wrong way.", "No, you're NTA. What was he thinking doing that to you and why would he do that? My god. As your father i would assume he's not unfamiliar with how you process emotions unless he's been completely checked out your entire life. \n\nYou're his child, he should be supporting  and nurturing you through this terrible loss, not going out of his way to hurt you further. I'm appalled by his behavior and even moreso by the fact that he has the gall to act hurt after he provoked you to react. This is classic play stupid games win stupid prizes but tragic because of the situation and timing. He owes you an apology asap. I hope you have other people around you with the emotional intelligence to support you through this time and I'm very sorry for your loss.", "After your latest comment your dad is a complete AH!", "Your dad is the AH. I'm so sorry for the loss of your mom. He shouldn't have prodded you that way. Grief is different for everyone. Crying in private is fine.

I have no respect for parents who treat their children like this.", "I'm really sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what a tough time this is for you, your dad and your family. This is really a time where you need one another and I hope that you'll find the support that you need to get through it.\n\nNAH", "NTA. You get a pass for a while on saying whatever the hell you want. You will go through all the stages of grief, some multiple times. The crying always hits me at odd, often in appropriate times. I didn\u2019t cry when my cousin passes until I asked my boss for funeral leave, then I couldn\u2019t stop crying in his office. That poor dude had no idea what to do:) I think, as long as it is not on purpose, you get to be TA for a while.", "NTA. My husband died suddenly of an unexpected medical issue in December. The days I spent in the ICU watching him die (he was never conscious) I cried a lot. Since the moment I left the hospital after they took him away, I haven't shed a tear. I'm devastated, I'm grieving, I'm only barely starting to function well, but no tears in 7.5 months. My mom often tries to get me talking about my husband to try to provoke some sort of reaction because she thinks this is weird, but FUCK OFF is the only reaction she ever gets. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, I hope no one else tries to tell you how to grieve. Good luck going forward.", "NTA. It's almost a trope now where people are expected to bawl their eyes out. He probably thinks you should. It's okay if you can't for whatever reason.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  It took me months to cry after losing my mother to Alzheimer's, largely, I think, because I'd been gradually losing her for years.  Grief is different for everybody, because relationships are different for everybody.  Don't let anybody try to direct your emotions.", "NTA \n\nEvery loss will have a different reaction and a different mourning period. Plus, we all display emotions differently. Do you have someone different you can stay with? Your dad is not processing this appropriately.", "Yes and no.\n\nMost probably he doesn't want you to feel bad for not crying, don't know about your dad particularly but usually guys are not masters at expressing their emotions. He's lost a lot too, and more than anyone else he understands what you're going through. Your dad is trying to get a reaction out of you because he understands that you need to let it out and also to show that if in front of no one else, you can cry in front of him. Everyone deals with grief in their own way, just try to tell him that.\n\nSo, yes, because you yelled at a man who was trying to help you in his way, and no because it's not you or him it's the situation you're in that's at fault.\n\nSorry for what you have to go through, but you have to navigate this situation with your family, and unless you're old enough to cut him out, for better or worse he's going to be a part of it.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The old excuse of \u201cguys can\u2019t express emotions\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here.", "Except that they've been divorced for years and according to OP fought all the time.", "Thank you. another thing that set me off was the feeling my grief was invalid or inadequate. but really, it\u2019s not for anyone else but me to go through", "Read Op\u2019s comments", "Pretty normal response to being taunted in an extremely hurtful way tbh", "This reminds me of the show \u201cShrinking\u201d (which is fantastic).", "I lost my dad last month so I can understand the anger that's there, again I don't know about your exact situation, but for me that \"old excuse\" was true, still is, I'm not able to cry because \"crying is weak for guys\", so yeah, that's a bit more than an excuse \ud83d\ude05, anyway, since they were divorced for a long time and you do tend to lose feelings for the person you were in love with 17 years ago, your anger makes even more sense.\n\n There can be 2 things here, the first is he's there for more or less a formality in which case just let him be he'll leave in a while, the second one being he's trying to help in which case just once tell him politely that how you deal with grief might be different from how he deals with it but that doesn't make it wrong, if he listens fine otherwise ignore him.\n\n\nThe harsh truth is in these situations you are the only one who has to support yourself and part of that is to focus on what's important, and that is your own mental peace, if it helps to cut him out then do it. \n\n\nOh and some advice which is a bit unrelated to what you asked, let it out, everything, doesn't have to be in front of anyone but do it, the other way around it hurts a lot, speaking from experience.", "My mom died in 2016, also drawn-out from illness, and honestly it was hitting me a lot harder a few years after than it did in the immediate days. Grief is weird and funky and different for everyone.\n\nI also felt my reaction was inadequate. Doesn't help that I'm autistic and have trouble identifying emotions to start with. My asshole dad accused me of not caring she died in the days after it happened.\n\nMy condolences for your loss. Your grief is not invalid or inadequate. It's okay to not be okay, but it's also okay to be okay.", "The manifestations of your grief are not invalid or inadequate. They will be different in an hour and different again tomorrow and then again next week. Same goes for dad.\n\nDad may be putting an insane amount of pressure on himself to take care of everybody and be in charge. So, I've got compassion for him too. He could be told that help is available when he's ready. \n\nTake care of yourselves. Again, lean when you need to lean."]}
