Taunting you because you're not grieving 'correctly'? I'm so sorry about your mom and even sorrier you're stuck with him as your only remaining parent.", "NTA. First off: I'm sorry for your loss.  \n\nYou will process your grief in your own way and in your own time.  Your dad (and others) have some preconceived notion of what your grief should look like and he is trying to force you into fitting his mold. He deserves what ever kind of response he gets, even if \"he means well\". You are not on stage to give everyone a handy \"poor little orphan child\" to pet over, for him or anyone else. \n\nAs for all those well meaning busy bodies: just say  \"I'm still processing.\"  For your dad,  ask him to arrange a grief councilor for you rather than him making his lame attempts to force you to grief to expectations.", "NTA\nNo one has a right to tell you how to grieve. I think the honest answer is you feel more comfortable grieving in private. Tell your father you simply don\u2019t have a relationship where you feel comfortable sharing your grief. He isn\u2019t allowed to compound it, you lived it the last year. Sometimes with prolonged illness there is some relief when the end comes because of the weight of care and the end of suffering. Tell him he wasn\u2019t there for the long process. You have been mourning her death for her entire illness and sometimes when the grief is so large opening the floodgates can be to much especially with someone else if you are private with your emotions. Honestly your outburst makes sense and I\u2019d add WTF is wrong with your dad to poke at you like this?", "NTA in the slightest. It's not your dad's place to govern your emotions.\n\nAnd I am deeply sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. I reacted the sage way when my beloved grandfather died. I couldn\u2019t cry. I was in shock and tried to be strong for my mum. Then, two days later, my mum asked me if I wanted to go to the funeral, that was 6 hours away. I said now. She asked me calmly, \u2018are you sure sweetheart\u2019? I said \u2018\u2019mum, I can\u2019t\u2019 and the tears came flooding in. I didn\u2019t cry until his memorial service 40 days later. But during the service, I couldn\u2019t stop crying for hours. You grieve in any way that\u2019s best for you. Just look after yourself any way you can. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry about your mum. You take care of you. And imo, even if you are an asshole today, it\u2019s ok and everyone should understand why. Especially your dad.", "NTA. You aren't a performing monkey and your grief isn't an entertainment show", "NTA\u2026i am alot like you. A bit stunned at first and usually focused on getting through it. The tears come later\u2026every one handles tragedy in their own way and there is no right or wrong way.", "No, you're NTA. What was he thinking doing that to you and why would he do that? My god. As your father i would assume he's not unfamiliar with how you process emotions unless he's been completely checked out your entire life. \n\nYou're his child, he should be supporting  and nurturing you through this terrible loss, not going out of his way to hurt you further. I'm appalled by his behavior and even moreso by the fact that he has the gall to act hurt after he provoked you to react. This is classic play stupid games win stupid prizes but tragic because of the situation and timing. He owes you an apology asap. I hope you have other people around you with the emotional intelligence to support you through this time and I'm very sorry for your loss.", "After your latest comment your dad is a complete AH!", "Your dad is the AH. I'm so sorry for the loss of your mom. He shouldn't have prodded you that way. Grief is different for everyone. Crying in private is fine.

I have no respect for parents who treat their children like this.", "I'm really sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what a tough time this is for you, your dad and your family. This is really a time where you need one another and I hope that you'll find the support that you need to get through it.\n\nNAH", "NTA. You get a pass for a while on saying whatever the hell you want. You will go through all the stages of grief, some multiple times. The crying always hits me at odd, often in appropriate times. I didn\u2019t cry when my cousin passes until I asked my boss for funeral leave, then I couldn\u2019t stop crying in his office. That poor dude had no idea what to do:) I think, as long as it is not on purpose, you get to be TA for a while.", "NTA. My husband died suddenly of an unexpected medical issue in December. The days I spent in the ICU watching him die (he was never conscious) I cried a lot. Since the moment I left the hospital after they took him away, I haven't shed a tear. I'm devastated, I'm grieving, I'm only barely starting to function well, but no tears in 7.5 months. My mom often tries to get me talking about my husband to try to provoke some sort of reaction because she thinks this is weird, but FUCK OFF is the only reaction she ever gets. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, I hope no one else tries to tell you how to grieve. Good luck going forward.", "NTA. It's almost a trope now where people are expected to bawl their eyes out. He probably thinks you should. It's okay if you can't for whatever reason.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  It took me months to cry after losing my mother to Alzheimer's, largely, I think, because I'd been gradually losing her for years.  Grief is different for everybody, because relationships are different for everybody.  Don't let anybody try to direct your emotions.", "NTA \n\nEvery loss will have a different reaction and a different mourning period. Plus, we all display emotions differently. Do you have someone different you can stay with? Your dad is not processing this appropriately.", "Yes and no.\n\nMost probably he doesn't want you to feel bad for not crying, don't know about your dad particularly but usually guys are not masters at expressing their emotions. He's lost a lot too, and more than anyone else he understands what you're going through. Your dad is trying to get a reaction out of you because he understands that you need to let it out and also to show that if in front of no one else, you can cry in front of him. Everyone deals with grief in their own way, just try to tell him that.\n\nSo, yes, because you yelled at a man who was trying to help you in his way, and no because it's not you or him it's the situation you're in that's at fault.\n\nSorry for what you have to go through, but you have to navigate this situation with your family, and unless you're old enough to cut him out, for better or worse he's going to be a part of it.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What you're dealing with is difficult enough without him judging and provoking you. I am so sorry you are going through this.", "NAH. Some people might feel ESH but I just see two people in unimaginable pain. One of whom is very young and I would expect you have little experience with death until this. Everyone grieves differently and you will lash out at each other in the moments when you are both hurting so bad and you just don't have any useful words to express the feelings. Words cannot express what you are both going through and my heart goes out to you both. Just be patient with each other. Time out when it's too tough and things are heating up and just remember the love that's at the heart of all the pain. It hurts like hell, but only because you love each other so much.", "Oh sweetheart. I'm so sorry. You can grieve anyway you see fit.

Most of the time even the person grieving can't make sense of it. Why? Because it's an individual process where one attempts to apply logic to an emotional impact.

Hopefully you have a good friend or close relative to lean on as well.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for the loss of your mother. It's heartbreaking and no one gets to tell you how to mourn or what your behavior should be. \n\nDad's can be boneheaded and not as emotionally tuned in to others, and it sounds to me like you instinctively knew he was pushing for a reaction. In an ideal world you'd have said,\" stop pushing my buttons. I will cry whenever I'm moved to cry and I do. I know you're worried but poking at me is just not what I need. I need  time &  space and to know I'm safe with you while I grieve. You're not making me feel safe\".\n\nEff off is perfectly acceptable in place of being able to share all you're going through.

In the end intentions don't matter where there is great damage.

How bravely she fought for 6 years and how the trajectory of her life changed in the last six months. \n\nFast forward to today: it has been more than five years and I still cannot go and visit anyone in the hospital as it brings me a personal trauma that no-one can understand. I cannot attend any funeral. I have a meltdown in funerals. There are days when I miss my old woman like crazy and I cry myself to sleep. \n\nDear OP, grieving has different forms.

When she passed we were relieved that she was at peace, that she was no longer suffering. \n\nSince that time we\u2019ve come to learn it is actually quite common to feel that way and is not something to feel guilty about. \n\nOP you grieve in whatever way is natural to you. At this stage it is also perfectly normal to feel numb and in shock. Telling your dad to F off is not wrong in these circumstances", "Yea thats true, but I dont think that's necessarily the case here that he was trying to make her cry, he was concerned about her emotional numbness (which is normal, but he wasn't used to it). He conceivably (based on OPs description) could have just been encouraging her to just 'feel something', in an effort to make sure she was properly processing emotions... and unfortunately for them, the way he did it was awkward and forceful.", "Oh wow, I think my unconscious bias assumed a son.\n\nI'm not advocating that this father be an asshole, I'm just saying as someone who is personally awkward with processing emotion at times, I've said things much more naive and inappropriate in grieving situations, and realized as Im saying them they were wrong, but also realizing that was just my natural reaction to the situation.", "I\u2019d disagree that expressing your emotions means giving up your composure. There\u2019s absolutely certain extremes where one should step back and ground themselves, but again, people deal with stuff differently. Not everyone cries, it\u2019s fine if they don\u2019t, but for others if you need to cry you just need to cry. That doesn\u2019t mean they jump straight into a complete meltdown, they\u2019re just processing their emotions in a way that\u2019s healthy for them"]}
