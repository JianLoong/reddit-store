Taunting you because you're not grieving 'correctly'? I'm so sorry about your mom and even sorrier you're stuck with him as your only remaining parent.", "NTA. First off: I'm sorry for your loss.  \n\nYou will process your grief in your own way and in your own time.  Your dad (and others) have some preconceived notion of what your grief should look like and he is trying to force you into fitting his mold. He deserves what ever kind of response he gets, even if \"he means well\". You are not on stage to give everyone a handy \"poor little orphan child\" to pet over, for him or anyone else. \n\nAs for all those well meaning busy bodies: just say  \"I'm still processing.\"  For your dad,  ask him to arrange a grief councilor for you rather than him making his lame attempts to force you to grief to expectations.", "NTA\nNo one has a right to tell you how to grieve. I think the honest answer is you feel more comfortable grieving in private. Tell your father you simply don\u2019t have a relationship where you feel comfortable sharing your grief. He isn\u2019t allowed to compound it, you lived it the last year. Sometimes with prolonged illness there is some relief when the end comes because of the weight of care and the end of suffering. Tell him he wasn\u2019t there for the long process. You have been mourning her death for her entire illness and sometimes when the grief is so large opening the floodgates can be to much especially with someone else if you are private with your emotions. Honestly your outburst makes sense and I\u2019d add WTF is wrong with your dad to poke at you like this?", "NTA in the slightest. It's not your dad's place to govern your emotions.\n\nAnd I am deeply sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. I reacted the sage way when my beloved grandfather died. I couldn\u2019t cry. I was in shock and tried to be strong for my mum. Then, two days later, my mum asked me if I wanted to go to the funeral, that was 6 hours away. I said now. She asked me calmly, \u2018are you sure sweetheart\u2019? I said \u2018\u2019mum, I can\u2019t\u2019 and the tears came flooding in. I didn\u2019t cry until his memorial service 40 days later. But during the service, I couldn\u2019t stop crying for hours. You grieve in any way that\u2019s best for you. Just look after yourself any way you can. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry about your mum. You take care of you. And imo, even if you are an asshole today, it\u2019s ok and everyone should understand why. Especially your dad.", "NTA. You aren't a performing monkey and your grief isn't an entertainment show", "NTA\u2026i am alot like you. A bit stunned at first and usually focused on getting through it. The tears come later\u2026every one handles tragedy in their own way and there is no right or wrong way.", "No, you're NTA. What was he thinking doing that to you and why would he do that? My god. As your father i would assume he's not unfamiliar with how you process emotions unless he's been completely checked out your entire life. \n\nYou're his child, he should be supporting  and nurturing you through this terrible loss, not going out of his way to hurt you further. I'm appalled by his behavior and even moreso by the fact that he has the gall to act hurt after he provoked you to react. This is classic play stupid games win stupid prizes but tragic because of the situation and timing. He owes you an apology asap. I hope you have other people around you with the emotional intelligence to support you through this time and I'm very sorry for your loss.", "After your latest comment your dad is a complete AH!", "Your dad is the AH. I'm so sorry for the loss of your mom. He shouldn't have prodded you that way. Grief is different for everyone. Crying in private is fine. Please remember to reach out if you need help.", "NTA as your dad was being rude, combative, insensitive and then tried to absolve himself of responsibility for his behaviour. I have no respect for parents who treat their children like this.", "I'm really sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what a tough time this is for you, your dad and your family. This is really a time where you need one another and I hope that you'll find the support that you need to get through it.\n\nNAH", "NTA. You get a pass for a while on saying whatever the hell you want. You will go through all the stages of grief, some multiple times. The crying always hits me at odd, often in appropriate times. I didn\u2019t cry when my cousin passes until I asked my boss for funeral leave, then I couldn\u2019t stop crying in his office. That poor dude had no idea what to do:) I think, as long as it is not on purpose, you get to be TA for a while.", "NTA. My husband died suddenly of an unexpected medical issue in December. The days I spent in the ICU watching him die (he was never conscious) I cried a lot. Since the moment I left the hospital after they took him away, I haven't shed a tear. I'm devastated, I'm grieving, I'm only barely starting to function well, but no tears in 7.5 months. My mom often tries to get me talking about my husband to try to provoke some sort of reaction because she thinks this is weird, but FUCK OFF is the only reaction she ever gets. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, I hope no one else tries to tell you how to grieve. Good luck going forward.", "NTA. It's almost a trope now where people are expected to bawl their eyes out. He probably thinks you should. It's okay if you can't for whatever reason.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  It took me months to cry after losing my mother to Alzheimer's, largely, I think, because I'd been gradually losing her for years.  Grief is different for everybody, because relationships are different for everybody.  Don't let anybody try to direct your emotions.", "NTA \n\nEvery loss will have a different reaction and a different mourning period. Plus, we all display emotions differently. Do you have someone different you can stay with? Your dad is not processing this appropriately.", "Yes and no.\n\nMost probably he doesn't want you to feel bad for not crying, don't know about your dad particularly but usually guys are not masters at expressing their emotions. He's lost a lot too, and more than anyone else he understands what you're going through. Your dad is trying to get a reaction out of you because he understands that you need to let it out and also to show that if in front of no one else, you can cry in front of him. Everyone deals with grief in their own way, just try to tell him that.\n\nSo, yes, because you yelled at a man who was trying to help you in his way, and no because it's not you or him it's the situation you're in that's at fault.\n\nSorry for what you have to go through, but you have to navigate this situation with your family, and unless you're old enough to cut him out, for better or worse he's going to be a part of it.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We were chatting about traffic and weather and he just broke the conversation with a segue into how her son died from a heroin overdose.  It wasn\u2019t even recently, it had been a year at that point.  I don\u2019t know if he wanted pity/attention or if he wanted to get a rise out of his wife, and I never understood how the fuck someone could be so callous and selfishly thoughtless about other\u2019s grief.", "Nah, the dad is clearly in the wrong and not the OP. It's one thing for the dad to let OP that it's ok to cry and that they are there for them. It's another for them to pummel OP the day after their moms passing to provoke a reaction, and for what? There are no lessons being taught here, no guidance or wisdom received. Just a grieving kid painfully experiencing that the one parent they have left is a manipulative shit disturber who can't give their child the space to grieve on their own terms.", "No, you\u2019re way off. Dad doesn\u2019t get to purposefully poke and prod OP because she\u2019s not grieving the way he expects her to. Instead of comforting her he\u2019s piling on her pain with hurtful comments like telling her she\u2019ll never hear her mother\u2019s voice again\u2026.as if OP didn\u2019t know that.\n\nIf he was serious about making sure she was ok, he\u2019d *comfort* OP and make himself emotionally available instead of needling her. OP is NTA.", "He was trying to be a dick. Why would he repeatedly tell her that she\u2019ll never see her mother again? How was that helpful?", "Trying to make sure OP is okay by rubbing the death of their mom in. Lol ok", "Her father is trying to goad her into grieving the way he thinks is right. However people grieve differently. You are a raging \u2018Viagra-fueled\u2019 dick.\n\nNTA OP", "How on ***earth*** is trying to force your child to have an emotional, and potentially traumatic, melt-down being \"a good parent\"? \n\nYou want to know how he could make sure OP is ok? Keeping an eye. Talking about *other* shit. Being available. ***Not*** continually reminding OP \"Oh hey, your moms dead. Right? She's dead? Dead as a doornail? How's THAT make you feel, ya know... since she's dead?\"", "His dad may also need someone to talk to, specifically his kid, and instead OP is (rightfully so) grieving in his own way, a way that his father doesn\u2019t understand. So his dad is perceiving his kid as not being sad that she is gone, and dad is very upset, so he tried to get a reaction in his own grief. \n\nNAH.", "He\u2019s probably going through a lot too. Everyone grieves in different ways", "yeah..i forgot that detail. that is so much worse\u2026", "yeah i 100 percent agree", "I saw that. Poor kid. The dad needs to be collected expeditiously because he's immature af. Dumping that on his child while they're grieving the loss of a beloved parent. It's not right.", "Hoping this is just a riff", "My dad got diagnosed with stage 4 in 2019, he was so sick he couldn\u2019t come to my wedding. He lasted 22 months but most of that was during the pandemic so no travel. By the time I saw him again he was so sick, he looked completely different. My mom called me home for the last month to help her. By the last 2 weeks he couldn\u2019t do anything. We were feeding him and changing diapers. He struggled to breathe. The relief is real. And it compounds with the grief.", "Op didn't say he hadn't been comforting. She did say she represses emotions. Then after someone repeatedly asks how she is and gets nothing in response she detonates. Something people who repress emotions are prone to do.\n\nAgree to disagree. My vote is A.", "Sounds like op represses emotions. Says she doesn't cry in front of anyone. Ant reasonable parent would try to make sure they were okay.", "Don't care. He even admitted he did it to upset her. F him. They've been divorced a long time too, I can see why. \n\nGrief (don't buy it for him) is never an excuse for abuse!", "Oh crap, my bad. I didn\u2019t see the part where he was provoking her on purpose. I thought he was just trying to figure out her emotions"]}
