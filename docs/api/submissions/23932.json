He got married a couple of years ago. His wife is cool, but can be a bit loud and extra sometimes. My girlfriend and I, were together for 8 years. I loved her and absolutely adored her.\n\nOur relationship was already stressed towards the end. I have my faults that I can admit to.... but I can't shake off the possibility that maybe *I* was the final straw.\n\nI'm not going to give away my ex-gfs profession, but she did art on the side. My best friend has a pretty good marketing job and had actually been doing a sort of advising/consulting thing for her employer. For free.\n\nLike I said, his wife can be a little extra. I don't care because they're obviously happy together, and I'm happy for them. She knows when and where to be chill and respectful, though. She's not just loud all of the time. My ex-gf would make fun of them after we'd hangout. Full on hateful personal attacks. I would ask her to stop when she wouldn't let up. \n\nShe broke up with me after our first couples therapy session. She said was having problems with herself and needed to see her own therapist. Ok, whatever, I'm honestly cool with it. We were still living together.\n\nSo, she had an art show coming up. It was a big one and there would be some important folks showing up. She told me it would be a great networking opportunity. I get that. So she sent out invites to everyone including me, my friend and his wife. They live 1.5 hours away. The night before her show she sat down next to me, laughed and said \"soooo i need you to babysit your friends wife tomorrow.\" And that I need to get them out of there as soon as possible and go out to eat or something. She then told me that she doesn't want to hear his wife's loud voice, or see her stupid hair, or see her little \"happy dances\", or see her stupid face. And then she said she doesn't want to hear my friends droning voice all night. She said that is my only \"job\" for that night. I reminded her that my friend is helping her company for FREE. It went on and on. The entire time she was doing an overly exaggerated impression of my friends wife.\n\nI called my friend and told him that maybe we should skip the show and I'll drive up and hang out. He somehow knew something was wrong, so I just told him the truth. The next day my (now ex, remember) gf, asked what time we'd be showing up. I told her we wouldn't be showing up because of how she acted last night. She flips out and starts screaming and throwing stuff and said I planned this on purpose to inflict maximum damage before her art show. I did not intend that at all.\n\nAnyway, she said that was the worst betrayal ever and she moved out a few days later.  \n\nMaybe it was. Was I the asshole, or is it just a shitty situation where there wasn't a good outcome? I definitely feel guilty about something though. Maybe we could've worked out if I didn't do that?", "created_utc": 1691241698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ivl2o/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_what_my_gf_was/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she didn't want to deal with friend's wife, she shouldn't have invited them.  How are you supposed to \"control\" an adult?", " NTA. Frankly, your ex sounds a bit like a drama queen.  She wanted them to drive 3 hour round trip so you could could \u201cbabysit\u201d the couple for the brief moment they are allowed to be there and then you\u2019re all to skedaddle asap?  I fail to see how you and your friends not showing up at all inflicts maximum damage.  I\u2019d have noped out of that as well. \n\nYou chose to not subject your friend and his wife to your ex-GF\u2019s toxic tendencies.  And the trash finally took itself out.  Count your blessings.", "It sounds to me like the only thing you should feel guilty about was staying with someone who was so mean to your long-term friends for as long as you did.", "NTA. From what you said your ex needed this lesson of \"you reap what you sow\". She deserved the outcome.", "NTA she was an ass towards your friends wife seemingly for a long time and you just told what is up,seemingly you removed a bullet because after 8 years we can't talk about dodging it anymore", "NTA  \n\n\nI'm sure there's more story behind your relationship, but at this face value your ex comes across as strangely hateful. If you're on good terms with your best friend and his wife, why would you want to entertain the fancy of someone that you're no longer in a commitment with AND she despises your friend's wife?  \n\n\nAlso this my personal bias, but I'd rather be informed about having to drive an hour and a half to spend any amount of time with someone that talked that much shit behind my back. I'd certainly be grateful if I was the friend's wife that you didn't let us waste time like that.  \n\n\nShe'll be alright, hopefully. Hope that for you too.", "NTA\n\nYour ex is a user that is mad that she can't take advantage of your friends' connections to boost her own career.", "Unless your friends wife is really loud and obnoxious when out in public and has to be the center of attention everywhere she goes then I don\u2019t get why she has to be \u201cbabysat\u201d all night. Sounds more like they just didn\u2019t click when they met and that\u2019s ok. Not everyone can be friends with everyone else. But to the level of keep her controlled is a bit harsh. I feel like I need a little more context of how his wife can be extra. But I\u2019m learning towards NTA. Especially if your relationship was on a downward trajectory towards the end anyways.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA sure you could have been more vague to your best friend to spare their feelings a bit but you were ready to choose them over your gf. It\u2019s ok to be the final straw to end something! As for screwing up your girlfriends art show? You didn\u2019t say or do anything there that would wreck it and rather than have someone drive 3 hours to be \u201cbabysat\u201d you took matters into your own hands and said for everyone\u2019s sake let\u2019s not go. It was a bold move but sounds like it was the right one", "NTA your ex really needs those therapy sessions", "NTA, but in the future, I would refrain from telling one person what another said.  This could have been handled a lot differently.  Even if someone suspects or asks, you don't have to answer so honestly.  Your ex is reaping what she sowed.  You created chaos with your best friend, then again with your gf.  I don't see what good came from any of it.  Sounds like both women just didn't clique and that's fine, but they didn't need you adding fuel to that fire.  You simply could have done something else with the friends and not shown up to the showing.", "YTA. It seems you put up with and tolerated, perhaps even encouraged her bitching about your friend and then randomly decided to out her one day when you knew it would be damaging to her. No one bitches like that to someone about their friend unless they've made it seem okay. \n\nI think you did it to be vindictive tbh because you didn't while you were together, nor did you give her much indication that you had a problem with it. \n\nYou were involved as much as she by default and instead of saying anything to her, you went to your friends.\n\nI think you're fooling yourself by acting like this was completely one sided and you weren't involved", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your ex wanted you to be ok with her using, and taking advantage of your friend while trash talking him, and his wife.  You did the righ thing by not allowing that to happen, and in ensuring she couldn't just go around you to take advantage of him.  He now knows the kind of person she is, and can protect himself from her.", "YTA", "Sorry, I didn't mention that my friend is *decently* connected. He could put in a good word for anyone anywhere. My ex told me several times that working with him would look good on future resumes. \n\nShe wanted him there for the networking opportunity and I essentially removed that chance.", "So she's loud and obnoxious and silly when it's appropriate. Or at least I think so. Like at parties, weddings, conventions, etc. If there's music playing she'll start dancing. But if we're at a wedding she's definitely not going to hop up and act crazy while the bride is coming down the aisle. She knows when to be respectful, and I know she would've been cool at the art show.", "As far as I know, my friend didn't tell his wife exactly what I said. I've seen her a couple of times since then and she still seems cool. I'm never going to bring it up again unless she REALLY wants to know. \n\nWhat's funny is she really loved my ex and had no idea what was going on.", "Oh nonono, I always asked her to stop whenever she'd start up. I did mention that in the post \u263a\ufe0f I always spoke up. I admit that if asking nicely or trying to talk to her about it didn't work, I would sometimes have to argue and yell at her. I tried every approach to make her stop. I even brought it up to the therapist and my ex said that was supposed to stay between me and her. I never once encouraged it.\n\nedit typo", "No\u2026she removed that chance by being so horrible about his wife.  I actually applaud you for finally taking a stand and choosing to no longer subject his wife to your ex\u2019s disrespect and ridicule. \n\nThis is all on her.  In all likelihood, this was going to eventually come back and bite her on the ass. Do you honestly think she only ridicules the wife to you and you alone?  Not likely if your friend is doing some work for her employer.  \n\nYour ex is a user.  You just didn\u2019t have any reason to see it before. But she has treated the invite as though it was a summons\u2026one that benefited only her.  And she couldn\u2019t be bothered to swallow her contempt for the wife long enough to actually reap the benefits\u2026even though she had enough info to know you did not like these attacks on the wife.\n\nLet go of any residual guilt you may feel.  You didn\u2019t betray your ex.  Her own contempt and sense of entitlement betrayed her.", "First, I'll start by saying your ex is a jerk. No question about it.\n\nI get it, you're defending your friend and his wife. But what did you exactly gain from this anyway? You gossiped from one person to another. If there were hurtful things said, why spread that? If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all, right? Your ex was being a jerk but instead of being firmer with her about her trash talking, you deliberately went and inflicted pain on your friend and his wife. They didn't deserve that. \n\nYou could've told your ex that she was no longer allowed to use your friend anymore because you guys have already broken up and avoid her interacting with your friend completely.\n\nI'm generally squeamish about ruining people's careers because of the state of the economy and don't want anyone to end up penniless or homeless. So I don't know how to feel about that aspect.\n\nI have to wonder if she's projecting her issues onto your friend's wife. Is it that your friend is married and you didn't propose to her?", "Then you\u2019re definitely NTA. The world need people who act a little out of the normal of everyone else but still know there is a time and place. It doesn\u2019t sound like a big loss breaking up with her. Keep your friends and find someone who can appreciate you for who you are and the good people in your life.  NTA", "Okay well if that's true then that's really weird and more justifiable on your part!"]}
