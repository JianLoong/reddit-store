He got married a couple of years ago. His wife is cool, but can be a bit loud and extra sometimes. My girlfriend and I, were together for 8 years. I loved her and absolutely adored her.\n\nOur relationship was already stressed towards the end. I have my faults that I can admit to.... but I can't shake off the possibility that maybe *I* was the final straw.\n\nI'm not going to give away my ex-gfs profession, but she did art on the side. My best friend has a pretty good marketing job and had actually been doing a sort of advising/consulting thing for her employer. For free.\n\nLike I said, his wife can be a little extra. I don't care because they're obviously happy together, and I'm happy for them. She knows when and where to be chill and respectful, though. She's not just loud all of the time. My ex-gf would make fun of them after we'd hangout. Full on hateful personal attacks. I would ask her to stop when she wouldn't let up. \n\nShe broke up with me after our first couples therapy session. She said was having problems with herself and needed to see her own therapist. Ok, whatever, I'm honestly cool with it. We were still living together.\n\nSo, she had an art show coming up. It was a big one and there would be some important folks showing up. She told me it would be a great networking opportunity. I get that. So she sent out invites to everyone including me, my friend and his wife. They live 1.5 hours away. The night before her show she sat down next to me, laughed and said \"soooo i need you to babysit your friends wife tomorrow.\" And that I need to get them out of there as soon as possible and go out to eat or something. She then told me that she doesn't want to hear his wife's loud voice, or see her stupid hair, or see her little \"happy dances\", or see her stupid face. And then she said she doesn't want to hear my friends droning voice all night. She said that is my only \"job\" for that night. I reminded her that my friend is helping her company for FREE. It went on and on. The entire time she was doing an overly exaggerated impression of my friends wife.\n\nI called my friend and told him that maybe we should skip the show and I'll drive up and hang out. He somehow knew something was wrong, so I just told him the truth. The next day my (now ex, remember) gf, asked what time we'd be showing up. I told her we wouldn't be showing up because of how she acted last night. She flips out and starts screaming and throwing stuff and said I planned this on purpose to inflict maximum damage before her art show. I did not intend that at all.\n\nAnyway, she said that was the worst betrayal ever and she moved out a few days later.  \n\nMaybe it was. Was I the asshole, or is it just a shitty situation where there wasn't a good outcome? I definitely feel guilty about something though. Maybe we could've worked out if I didn't do that?", "created_utc": 1691241698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ivl2o/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_what_my_gf_was/", "score": 1005, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or at least I think so. Like at parties, weddings, conventions, etc. If there's music playing she'll start dancing.

In all likelihood, this was going to eventually come back and bite her on the ass. Do you honestly think she only ridicules the wife to you and you alone?  Not likely if your friend is doing some work for her employer.  \n\nYour ex is a user.  You just didn\u2019t have any reason to see it before. But she has treated the invite as though it was a summons\u2026one that benefited only her.

You didn\u2019t betray your ex.  Her own contempt and sense of entitlement betrayed her.", "Edit: Wow, just wow. After OP'S response, he is NTA. The ex is an absolute AH and I'm glad she's gone. I really wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt about protecting, but she really is awful. \n\nOriginal comment: \n\nFirst, I'll start by saying your ex is a jerk. No question about it.\n\nI get it, you're defending your friend and his wife. But what did you exactly gain from this anyway? You gossiped from one person to another. If there were hurtful things said, why spread that? If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all, right? Your ex was being a jerk but instead of being firmer with her about her trash talking, you deliberately went and inflicted pain on your friend and his wife. They didn't deserve that. \n\nYou could've told your ex that she was no longer allowed to use your friend anymore because you guys have already broken up and avoid her interacting with your friend completely.\n\nI'm generally squeamish about ruining people's careers because of the state of the economy and don't want anyone to end up penniless or homeless. So I don't know how to feel about that aspect.\n\nI have to wonder if she's projecting her issues onto your friend's wife. Is it that your friend is married and you didn't propose to her?", "Then you\u2019re definitely NTA. The world need people who act a little out of the normal of everyone else but still know there is a time and place. It doesn\u2019t sound like a big loss breaking up with her.

NTA", "Okay well if that's true then that's really weird and more justifiable on your part!", "NTA. As your gf then she should have respected your best friend\u2019s wife, and based on how she spoke about the wife she is a bit overdramatic, anyone can be loud she is just a btch about the wife. \n\nAnd was clearly using your best friend\u2019s connections only for her own gain.

I'm curious, is your friend's wife very beautiful? It's possible your ex girlfriend was jealous.", "NTA. You showed the proper loyalty to your friend and his wife. Your EX wanted to use your friend for clout, while also constantly hating on him and his wife behind his back. Your ex is a petty, hypocritical climber, who doesn't deserve the shine reflected your friend's success. Her tantrum at not being allowed to use you and your friend anymore should tell you that you've dodged a bullet. If that's how she talk to you how do you think she talks about you to others?

You wouldn't have worked out anyway.\n\nYour gf already left you, she just hadn't finished moving her body out the door yet. It is awesome that she has finally physically moved.\n\nIt's possible that your friend's wife is genuinely irritating and your ex could have valid reasons to feel irritated near her; even from the way you yourself phrase it, it sounds like you're tolerating this woman rather than genuinely enjoying her company. (\"I don't care because they're obviously happy together\" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement.) \n\nAt the same time, it is gross for your ex to incessantly insult this woman to you after you asked her to stop. (I mean, being rude behind someone's back is a gross behaviour anyway, but especially disturbing when someone can't stop after it's called to their attention.) And it is absurd that your ex invited someone to an event when she didn't actually want them to attend, and that she then thought she could strong-arm you into trying to control those invitees' behaviour while they were there.", "You dodged a bullet with that one. NTA ur ex is a psycho", "> She said was having problems with herself and needed to see her own therapist\n\nNo kidding\u2026 She thinks you betrayed her by arranging so that the people she didn\u2019t want there wouldn\u2019t be there.

You don\u2019t owe her anything.", "The thing is I've been around his wife long enough to see that she knows when and where to be cool. I wouldn't have had to do anything! And then what... was I also supposed to tell my friend to control his wife?", "I told him the details without telling him the DETAILS. As far as I know he didnt tell his wife those exact details either. She has an idea, but is still her regular old self around me. I never wanted to have to choose between two people I love. That should be for movies.", "Haha I've never looked at it that way!", "Ahh wel that is interesting information", "I tried talking to her about it. I tried asking nicely. I tried asking not so nicely. I brought it up in our therapy session and she got mad and said that was supposed to stay between us. I was never going to make her like my friends wife. Just to stop with the personal attacks. \n\nI had absolutely nothing to gain from it. It was just finally time to speak up.\n\nSo her career is fine and it was always going to be fine. She is set for life where she's at. Her career wasn't going to be in jeopardy from this and my friend wasn't going to do anything to sabotage that either. A few weeks before the event she laughed and told me that it's great that my friend would be there because she could say \"oh by the way, look who *I* know! wink wink.\" to everyone. \n\nShe didn't want to get married. I was okay with that. Neither happy nor sad. I was fine with being life partners or whatever.", "Okay, got it. She's absolutely an AH and you don't need her.", "the level of petty hate about her face and hair and happy dance makes it sound like your ex has more than jealousy going on.

None of this is stuff I can fully contain and even on my 'best-behaved' days I slip. \n\nThroughout my whole life I've been told I'm too much. I'm annoying. I'm weird.

That's why AuDHD comes with rejection sensitive dysphoria, because it's actually a symptom of cPTSD from being thrown to the wayside for all of that shit that I can't control. \n\nAll of this is to say that for your ex girlfriend to present herself as a friend and a safe place to this woman while simultaneously being downright horrific behind her back is disgusting. Finding out that someone who you thought finally appreciated and enjoyed your 'quirks', if you will, only to find out that they take any opportunity to belittle, mock, or infantalize you when you aren't paying attention is one of the most heartbreaking things I've gone through. \n\nNTA but your ex is so unequivocally cruel", "NTA.

All you did was expose that she is a fake friend to your real friends. She's just using your best friend for networking. She acts like she likes them but then talks mad shit the moment they are out of sight. People like this don't do this in a vacuum. If they talk shit *to* you, they will also talk shit ABOUT YOU.

She's a user and fakes kindness for clout.\n\nAdditionally, when confronted about her remarks and knowing the friend, wife and you wouldn't attend, she got aggressive with you.

You don't owe her anything. As her boyfriend, it would be different but then I'd be calling you the AH for staying with someone that is so fake and cruel. Oh, and the she got kinda violent, screaming and throwing things. A lot of people would consider that to be abusive behavior. She moved out and... You want her back? Why? I hope you ask yourself why you are drawn to someone like her. I'm sure she has some redeeming qualities and charm, but she doesn't sound like a good person. She sounds like a narcissist. And I've dated plenty. I promise you, it isn't worth it. I recommend you look inward to try and understand this attraction because she might try to love-bomb you into getting together again once she experiences some negative consequences and you shouldn't do it.

No seriously, I was hoping our counseling would help. Because in the 6 years before my friend got married the relationship was great. Oh and it was HER idea to start couples therapy. It just took a few months for the one she wanted to have an opening. I researched her too and agreed she'd be a good match. I'm actually still at that same therapist.  \n\nBut the one session we had she spent the hour pretty much screaming at me and the therapist. And made up a couple of lies too that made zero sense.

I commend you for sticking up for her and defending her and defending your friend and sticking up for your friend. Your ex got her just desserts.", "Yea, I feel you on the quitting thing. I'm similar in that I just hate quitting a relationship. Sunk-cost fallacy, avoiding feeling like I failed. But I kinda think previous generations were wrong about that stuff, especially when it comes to relationships. Older people put up with so much more abuse and shitty treatment that often wasn't worth it. Like... Maybe they kept their 2-parent household together but then end up with kids that struggle to form healthy relationships. The consequences are different than what they wanted to avoid, but no less harmful. Anyway I'm rambling but yea, some things are worth quitting. Especially when it's a relationship where one person blames everything on you. She likely wanted counseling because she thought the therapist would also blame you. I'm glad it didn't work. It's recommended to never go to counseling with a narcissist or an abuser because they will use it to manipulate you and the therapist and it's just not gonna go well. Sometimes the therapists can see through it and will recommend the abuser go to individual counseling. But often they fall victim to the manipulation too.", "No worries! It's her being insensitive, not you. The quotes were very informative on her behaviour, rather than just describing the insults vaguely.
