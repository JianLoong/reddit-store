The next day he called me to let me know his 'friend' was a girl he's been dating and wants to bring her to my house to meet my family.

I feel for the lady, as it isn't her fault that her flight was canceled. It is going to be incredibly akward for her to meet a bunch of people she doesn't know. But you are under no obligation to entertain a stranger in your own home. I wouldn't do it if I was in the same position, regardless of who they were to my parent. That is not the time, place or circumstances for such a meeting.", "NAH. He asked, you said no. You said he seemed offended but it doesn\u2019t sound like there was any real fallout from your decision, which means he ultimately respected your answer. It seems like a lot of your frustration is rooted in the fact that your dad didn\u2019t tell you he had a gf. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. \n\nTelling your family that you\u2019re dating someone can sometimes be hassle so it\u2019s understandable that your dad would want to keep the relationship private for the time being. Your dad would be a jerk if he didn\u2019t go to Christmas dinner or if he left his gf at home while he went to the dinner. The decent thing was to bring her with him and he knew it wouldn\u2019t be right for his child and grandkids to meet his gf along with the extended family. It sounds like he was just trying to manage this situation appropriately. I don\u2019t think you should take it personally.", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't ever feel bad about not allowing someone you never met into your home because you never know what they might say. I have a rule of if I can't call you a close friend you don't come in my home for that very reason!"]}
