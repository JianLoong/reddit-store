Definitely should be a discussion about not asking you first, and frankly, comes across very dismissive of the miscarriage problems you had.\n\nHoping it wasn't done maliciously, but does seem a needlessly cruel thing to do.", "NTA When a man dismisses and laughs off a woman's deep distress, it is time to rethink the entire relationship. Especially when he gave away a sentimental item to a Frenemy. It means you are bottom on his priority list compared to these other people.", "NTA. Leave him and never look back. He seems to never consider your feelings", "NTA. \n\nHe laughed? You need to have a serious conversation about the future with him and brace yourself. It sounds like he\u2019s not invested in this relationship anymore.", "I agree with this.

I have my guess as to what it is given what she did say, however, and if I'm right, it's something you learn to live with-not really get over. Plus, you don't know that the medical bills for her illness are currently preventing her from correcting the financial problems. \n\nI think having hope, is a good thing.", "Wow, you are coming off really ... judgemental. Chronic ill people can have children, sometimes it takes time to manage the illnes, sometimes even years but then they are fine with it as you can be with an illness. Marriage is long gone as a requirement for children in the western world. As a religious person myself i think you are either super religious, very old or very young because you seem only to know black and white and not grey in the world. Your comment helped noone.", ">Always find it odd when these posts come from an account that is like 2 years old with no other posts.

Once you told him how you felt he could have easily grabbed a gift card.", "NTA. You mean your ex-boyfriend?", "NTA This is so much more as just some just. He gave something away what gave you hope, meant so much for you and represented the possible future you try to have. But he just gave them away while he knew how bad you feel and especially after a miscarriage... And why? He was to lazy to buy a present and why not take something from his stuff? Why this one thing that meant so much for you? And even as you told him not to. No, he was laughing(!) when you begged him not to. \n\nI'm sorry that you go through all this. But please ask yourself if he is still the right partner. Did he maybe changed? His behaviour was really awful. You don't regift a gift, especially not such a special one. You don't laugh at the distress of your partner. \n\nAnd i would also contact the gf of the friend and tell her the story that he gave her your shoes. Maybe send her this link. Ask for them back. They are the shoes for your future child!", "NTA. Unless this guy is taking really good care of you through your illness (somehow I doubt it) you need to do your best to move on from this relationship.

Tell him/her that it was a mistake and your guy didn\u2019t know that those had emotional value. I hope you can get them back. There is no shame in getting them back. \n\nAnd what is wrong with your guy? Sorry you went through that!", "NTA Clearly your bf has shown you that your feelings do not matter to him, pay attention!!
