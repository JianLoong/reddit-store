It's not as if you're blowing your whole check at the pub, you're networking while eating a decent meal. If she wants to sock away even more money, I'm sure she can come up with ways to do that - doing her own nails and finding less expensive places to get her hair done, comes immediatelyto mind.", ">I responded that I noticed that she still spends at least $500 a month on beauty stuff like her hair and nails.\n>She said that she was doing that for me\n\nLOL. I call bullshit. Seriously, buddy, would you cease to love her if she didn't have an expensive cut & style, or painted her own nails at home instead of paying someone? She's doing that for herself. \n\nNow it may be that is money well spent. If it makes her happy, maybe it's worth it. I would never pay $500 a month on hair & nails, but then I don't even wear make-up, so the idea confounds me. The point is, you have what you feel is a very good reason for using the meal allowance (and that one I understand, lol).

And if you have to put every single cent towards this house you're building, then no more socialisation for her either, especially when she could just call her sister, or at least invite her to your house to reduce expenses.\n\nThen, you really should add that you don't *want her* to do that, that's it's only an analogy.
