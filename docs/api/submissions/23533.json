I like to look good, plain and simple. \n\nYou have the same right to spend personal money, as she does. I'd be tempted to tell her you thinks she's a natural beauty, and she doesn't need to do all of those things. \n\nThen have the conversation again.

You spend 3/4 of the month away from home, 12hrs a day, and she thinks you should lay on your bunk and look at the ceiling during your down time? I'd like to see her try it. It's not as if you're blowing your whole check at the pub, you're networking while eating a decent meal. If she wants to sock away even more money, I'm sure she can come up with ways to do that - doing her own nails and finding less expensive places to get her hair done, comes immediatelyto mind.", ">I responded that I noticed that she still spends at least $500 a month on beauty stuff like her hair and nails.\n>She said that she was doing that for me\n\nLOL. I call bullshit. Seriously, buddy, would you cease to love her if she didn't have an expensive cut & style, or painted her own nails at home instead of paying someone? She's doing that for herself. \n\nNow it may be that is money well spent. If it makes her happy, maybe it's worth it. I would never pay $500 a month on hair & nails, but then I don't even wear make-up, so the idea confounds me. The point is, you have what you feel is a very good reason for using the meal allowance (and that one I understand, lol). She feels she has a good reason for what she spends on beauty stuff. \n\nNTA, and what's good for the goose is good for the gander.", "NAH, but you both need to agree on an \u201callowance\u201d for each of you, ie., $$ she and you can spend anyway you want, hobbies, nails, brunch, beer\u2026..   21 days of just work and no way to let of steam would be painful.  The pub, as long as you aren\u2019t drinking your paycheck away is also a good networking site.  Your wife\u2019s beauty and nails is probably relaxing for her and good for her self esteem.  \n\nCommunicate, work it out.", "ESH\n\nYou 2 are not exactly liking each other right now, if that's how you communicate; She was rather out of line but you were passive aggressive as well. \n\nThrowing in her face her beauty expenses when you hit the pub EVERY NIGHT makes you both hypocrites, really. From her point of view, you have free food available to you and you choose to pay for it instead every night. From your point of view doing her hair and beauty regime is a waste of money. \n\nThat's not exactly a good omen for how you will deal with money when buying a house together", "Yta, not for this, but because you and your partner own homes and want to rent them to pay a mortgage. \nIt is because of negative gearing like this that society is screwed atm, not a personal attack and sorry if it comes across like that but im sick of seeing the poor exploited for someone elses profit and no one says anything either because they're doing it or they dream/plan too themselves.", "YTA. I read the title, and nothing else.", "NTA\n\nYou both get to do something that makes you feel better. She needs to get over it.", "That was my thought as well....but she can't say she spend money on her beauty regimen for you hell you work 10-12 hours a day she's doing it for herself as well you work hard you should also be allowed to do things for yourself", "And you think you can make an accurate judgement based on the title alone? You\u2019re the A lmao", "How are \u201cthe poor\u201d being exploited?", "NTA - Tell her the $500 beauty expense can stop now since she's beautiful enough and she can meet her sister at a McDonald's or a park.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe you should both agree on a set budget for extras.", "NTA, completely. Working at a camp is dang rough on your mental health, and time to just enjoy the company of friends is important!", "NTA NTA", "She's doing her hair, make up, and nails for you? Yeah, sure. Whatever she says. NTA, man.", "NTA by any means.  I don\u2019t understand why if you are at work 21 days in a row why you can\u2019t go out and network/socialize with your work crew. You admit this helps your jobs/income in the long run and doing so yields better finances in the future.  Her going to brunch and salon do not. Tell her you don\u2019t mind (assuming you don\u2019t) her not going to get her nails and what not done to save on that expense.", "NTA\n\nShe wants you to save for the house but is she saving as much for the house as you? And is the rental income from her house going into the joint account?  \n\nJust based on this post, it sounds like she's treating all money in the household like it's hers.", "Hes spending $40 a day x 21 days. That's $840 a month. YTA op.", "You can read?", "No, op is spending less than his meal allowance. He doesn\u2019t specify how much less. Also, this type of hour set up is extremely taxing. It is completely reasonable that op eat food that he enjoys and seeks out companionship with his colleagues to enjoy his time and network for new jobs.", "It\u2019s his meal allowance, why shouldn\u2019t he use it??", "Except he's not, he said 'dinner and a few beer is less than my meal allowance.' We don't know exactly how much of it he is spending, her issue is that he is spending anything extra which could be used for the house.", "Because he is already getting free meals, which he is throwing away. Then pissing away money in the pub. Money that he agreed with his wife would go towards the new house. He's TA x3.", "You are both assholes for wanting to be landlords I stopped reading after that everything else is irrelevant", "NTA.. you deserve some nice meals and a few drinks for this kind of work and being away from home", "This is extra food money.  If you didn\u2019t work the extra hours you wouldn\u2019t get it. But you do and that money is yours!", "NTA. Unless she hates getting her hair and nails done, it's for her and not you. She can't hold that against you. I also think you deserve to spend your little bit of extra income on chilling out with your friends. You're not blowing all your money being silly, you're being a normal human.", "NTA.  I fail to see how monthly brunches with her sister are for you.  As for hair and nails, that's her choice to get, you aren't asking her to do it, so again it's not for you.\n\nThat $40 a day is for food and you're using it for food.  Your wife sounds....greedy", ">She said that she was doing that for me\n\nNTA and is she really...? :D", "Wow! So you're not \"allowed\" to spend your meal allowance on actual meals that you want to eat, but she's allowed to spend her money on whatever she likes? NTA.  Huge red flag.", "His wife is spending 500 a month on cosmetics and goes to brunch every week, thats easily 700+ a month aswell", "His wife is literally pissing away 500 on vanity.\n\nHe atleast gets money to eat she gets zero returns from her monthly cosmetic work.", "That's not the point. He agreed that she can spend the 500 and to put his money towards the house. She is sticking to the deal, he isn't."]}
