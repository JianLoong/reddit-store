They've instituted a dress code for the event, which they are allowed to do. You are unwilling to conform to the dress code so you've elected not to go. If they, or your husband, tried to force you to comply, they'd be AHs. If you went and disregarded the dress code, you'd be the AH. But as it is, you've removed yourself from the situation and so there are not AHs.\n\n(Side note, if you're in the US, many places have rules about dress codes, specifically about making in more onerous on one gender than the other)", "NTA.

If for nothing else, to get a pulse on his work environment. As a member of a stricter religion I\u2019m a little surprised they\u2019re enforcing that? Curiosity would get me, and I would go. Nothing like hands on understanding a different culture.", "Oh joy, A picnic in long clothing /s. Nta-instituting a strict dress code for a picnic seems strange to me.

Hell no, that's unreasonable.", "The lack of respect for others beliefs shows YTA. You remove your shoes when entering an Asian home or a Mosque. Like the people or not, respect then for their religious beliefs even if you do not follow it, it is not going cause you to burst into flames and start reciting the dictionary.", "YTA. It's one afternoon, it's your husband's job, Mennonites are very nice and very family oriented in their culture. You choosing not attending because you were requested to wear a skirt could affect how his bosses view your husband and his ability to fit into the company culture. Respecting the host in requesting a dress code be followed is not the massive imposition you are making it out to be. Would you wear jeans and T-shirt to a corporate event if your husband worked for a major corporation, or would you wear it to a wedding? The people I know who are Mennonite would have no problem with you wearing jeans and a T-shirt in more casual circumstances. Eventually, if you develop a relationship with this community, you could see a relaxation of the dress code. Rejecting them because of the current dress code requirements is silly.", "NTA that\u2019s a stupid dress code, if it\u2019s an outside picnic they\u2019re also forcing women to have cold legs which sucks ass.", "Info: So both the shirt and skirt need to be ankle length? Couldn\u2019t you just wear an ankle length dress? I doubt anyone is going to be lifting it up to make sure you have a skirt on underneath.", "NTA. That said, How much does it mean to your husband if you do go? Do what makes you comfortable. (It will most likely be delicious food. And I would wear a dress for a few hours just to eat some! ) Would you be comfortable wearing something below the knee or mid-calf length? Typically Mennonite women I see at the local farmers market wear mid-calf length.  If you wear something with a very colorful print you will not be following the plain dress code Mennonites follow. The traditions of the religion are to be plain, everyone wears similar plain dresses, solid color, all the men wear plain pants and white shirts.", "NAH.  You would not be the asshole for goingbor not, but you might if you show up in bootie shorts and a tube-top.\n\nI presume your husband is also expected to show up in long pants, longgl sleeves, etc?  If he's showing up in cargo shorts and a tank top, that's a whole different picnic.", "NTA but honestly how hard is it to just get a long skirt and go for a few hours just so it looks good for your husband? Personally I think its stupid but if that's the rules then its something beyond your husband's control.", "NAH. Also, from the title, I literally thought this was more going to be about everyone having to wear one-size-fits-all company t-shirts! If you want to go, can you find a cute long skirt that fits your vibe since they are in style now? Nothing Mennonite but just like a casual long-ish skirt/dress, tennies, t-shirt, etc. The way you would if you were out sightseeing in Italy and needed to abide by a dress code to visit a church. Or any other event with a dress code that you would mind out of respect  (ie, like a wedding, etc)", "If it will make your husband look bad or if it could be seen as a negative thing for your husband\u2019s job would you consider wearing one? Following a certain dress code to be respectful isn\u2019t the end of the world, but if its non-negotiable to you then you should not go. \n\nNot sure if the AH or NTA bc there isn\u2019t much info to go on.", "Info can men also wear a skirt or not?\nAnd what is a Mennonite? I assume some silly cult", "NAH But I've known some very cool mennonites. I get the feeling they are committed to their set of beliefs, but their way of life is impressive in its simplicity and their insights can be surprisingly deep. FWIW", "You don't have to go,  it it seems a shame to miss out for such an easy fix. Maybe culottes?", "YMBTA if you benefit from your husband's job.

Very unprofessional of them", "Wouldn\u2019t that go both ways though? For example, a Christian shouldn\u2019t force a Muslim woman to remove her hijab for a work event. Should a Muslim woman force a Christian woman to wear one ? Are non-believers then not allowed freedom of religion too (in this case of not being forced into a religious observance)?

Mennonites are a religious sect that are common in my area along with the Amish. There are similarities, but Mennonites drive cars, have phones and electricity and all the modern conveniences.

Also married women wear their hair up and wear a small net cap or lace circle over their hair. One of my fellow nurses is Mennonite.

Some are very modern and indistinguishable from any other people, others (Old Order) are very strict and not so different from the Amish. The two groups descend from the original Anabaptists of Europe but divided over theological differences. The Amish were followers of Jakob Amman, the Mennonites of Menno Simnons. Too much info but I'm descended from both groups, as well as a third Anabaptist group.", "Being told an event is smart casual is not the same as being told to wear something that is dictated due to a religion you don\u2019t practice", "The old order Mennonites don't generally work in modern hospitals, so I have less experience with them. Central PA including Lancaster have large populations of both Amish and Mennonites.
