How far is a company allowed to go in regards dress code for a work event?

A tuxedo to a business meeting?\n\nThe only dress code which isn\u2019t an excess use of power would be one which is generally socially acceptable for the occasion.

We don't do those where I am. (I'm not in the Americas) But in any case, why not bring 2 dishes? One for yourself and one for the table. If the one for you has pork but you don't expect anyone else to eat it and warn them it contains pork, how would that be disrespectful as long as you brought something everyone could eat? \n\nAnd I wouldn't bring the food I could eat for everyone, because frankly, it's expensive and rather bland.
