So my boss decided to come and brought his wife along.  He went to the conference and she hung out at the pool and we all met up for lunch and drinks at one point.\n\nReally just depends on the industry and company.", "Same here, as long as the company doesn't have to cover any extra, it's fine.", "It's incredibly common and encouraged in some industries/companies.", "Literally, I travel with my husband all the time on his work trips.

My partner went to Japan for a work trip and even though I really wanted to go because it would be my first time visiting, I held off and we made plans for another trip. But on the follow up trip that was supposed to be fun, we ended up meeting some of his clients and it was basically a second business trip by accident. \n\nHe'll want to do all the fun things, probably want to spend hours walking around, doing tourist stuff, and obviously eat with you. But when someone is working, it's being in a mindset of work. And you'll have to switch on and off and take on that extra mental burden. You also won't have the time to baby him, which you shouldn't even be required to do. Just thinking out how it'll be, it already sounds exhausting. And when my partner's trip ended up being a work event, we were both unhappy.

Because they are putting you up in the same hotel regardless of if someone else is there or not. Obviously a partners food and travel costs wouldn't be expensed.

Sure, it would be an extra week that you'd have to pay for accommodation but, if the company is paying for your flights, they would likely book an extended return date without issue to take advantage of the trip.\nOtherwise, he could go the same week as you as long as firm boundaries are set. Basically, he is utilizing the accommodation that has been paid for to save money but, due to your commitments, energy level etc he needs to be aware that he needs to treat the trip as if he's a solo traveller and the importance of the trip running smoothly so that it's successful. \nI don't think your an AH but, empathize with him as well.", "I sense you find it hard saying No to him or he is dominant so you\u2019re afraid he will push you into doing things you don\u2019t want at the expense of your career. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s best to go solo and explain him you would rather go together some other time to enjoy things without work interruptions. \nHowever, you could make it work this time - you just need to make it clear to him that the only time you could spend together is when you\u2019re free from your work engagements. And he needs to fill his days by himself, which isn\u2019t difficult in Japan - so many things to do. \nI guess that\u2019s easier said than done.

He needs to understand that this is a work trip, and that you need to be focused on work and not worried about him being entertained. Perhaps the two of you could plan a trip to Japan later in the year. I would give him that option, explaining everything you have told us. Or you could just let him read this entire post.", "Suggestion: Can you ask if the client can change your departure date to a few days later just to give you time to enjoy Japan? If so, you could ask your bf to come out after your work is done, and see the sights with him then. You\u2019d still have to split the cost of a couple days of lodging, but you wouldn\u2019t have to pay airfare, and having you there with him in Japan is probably a bigger deal to him than your swanky corporate-funded hotel.

I love him, but I am also super passionate about my career and want to be fully present on important work trips. \n\nI would just go around feeling torn if he was with me. I would feel bad being with him because I let down my colleagues missed out on things AND feel bad when I was not with him for obvious reasons. \n\nSo NTA.", "NTA. Not at all. I wrote this as I\u2019m on a work trip myself that my husband wanted to come on.
