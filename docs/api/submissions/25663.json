Tf?", "Idk if you\u2019re missing my entire post, I care about his feelings too much that I\u2019m caught between letting him come or having a boundary. I\u2019ve been modelling before I met him and travelling before I met him too, so I just don\u2019t see why he needs to be there when I\u2019m working.", "Especially with a Japanese client.", "Maybe because I love him and can accept his flaws, I just need another opinion", "This isn't a 9-5 job where it's clock in, clock out.  The whole TRIP is a gig, not just the shoot itself.  There really isn't a lot of down time or time alone, and even when there is it's spent networking and respecting social protocol.  On top of that, she will be judged on her partner's behaviour.  It doesn't matter if you think she should be or not.  It's part of traditional Japanese culture.  \n\n\n\"She brought her boyfriend so we won't book her again\" is a very real reality if he comes along.", "And I still say you\u2019re clueless", "I didn\u2019t really see that implication in their post at all. The vibe I got was more like they would consider it unprofessional to treat what is supposed to be a work trip as a fun vacation by bringing your significant other along for sightseeing adventures. Regardless of whether she ultimately goes sightseeing or whatever - the fact she brought her boyfriend along would make it look like she isn\u2019t taking this seriously.", "The first comment effectively said \u201cthey won\u2019t book you for a second job if you bring a partner on the first job - unless it was pre-agreed that you could bring them\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely saying she will damage her career & rule out any future work from these people if she lets boyfriend come along with her.", "You know nothing about the trade. If you hire talent like OP and they show up with another person that was unaccounted for and has nothing to do there, she may lose the gig and get blacklisted. The only AH here is the BF acting like a child.", "That is the right thing to do for your career.", "I got those vibes too though. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation as OP, though not as a model in Japan, but working all day in a foreign country for five days. My OP asked me to go and was willing to pay, and she did. But I said that this trip is work. From 8am to 10pm each day, I\u2019m working. \n\nShe did her own thing and we got to fall asleep and wake up with each other every day, and neither of us regretted the decision. To me, OP sounds like she doesn\u2019t trust her BF from wanting time with her, the ESH. The BF for being clingy and OP for having not set boundaries yet.", "100%. Being respectful and dutiful is number one over there. Having your boyfriend tag along and be a distraction or be a reason that you cannot go to a client dinner because he wants to go do something with you instead would be so so bad.", "\nBeing codependent isn\u2019t consider a flaw. It\u2019s seen as being unhealthy especially in relationships.", "Is there a reason you're assuming her bf is showing up to work with her?\n\nWhere did you read that?", "Idk tho, she shouldn\u2019t have to set the boundary that he isn\u2019t allowed to interfere with her work. That\u2019s pretty common knowledge.", "Plus the client is paying for the accommodations.", "the client booked an accommodation for op to stay in, and he'd like to stay in it. that is being at her work."]}
