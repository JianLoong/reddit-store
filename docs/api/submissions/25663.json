It is not at all uncommon in many places/industries.", "are you really comparing a surgeon traveling to perform an operation with going to japan to put on some cute clothes and have pictures taken of you ?", "We absolutely do!! They have a conference or traveling job across the country? I\u2019m going with him but doing everything independently during the day - there\u2019s normally a day or two at the end that we do something together, but even when there\u2019s not it\u2019s fun to be in the same city together and meeting back up late each night.", "Actually that's not a great example. Most physicians travel for conferences, etc and it's typically expected that spouses come.  In fact their is almost always a dinner where spouses are invited and encouraged to attend!", "That's not the question that the commenter is asking.", "bullshit, absolute bullshit, no she didn't. she only explained what she THINKS he'll say and how she THINKS he''ll feel, absolutely not. \n\nYTA, communicate with your partner, this is all baseless bullshit assumptions from OP and the bf's intentions", "I can recall my now wife being quite surprised how many of the places I\u2019d been to for work I hadn\u2019t really been to at all when we traveled there together.\n\nI suspect BF would have a miserable trip anyway. The Japan OP\u2019s going to experience is not the same Japan he wants to see.", "It's not a good look sneaking your boyfriend into paid for accommodation either. Her colleagues will be put up in the same hotel, they'll realise soon enough she's brought a mooch along and that might tarnish her reputation.\n\nWithout invitation from the employer I wouldn't let home come at all. \n\nNTA", "Bahaha you obviously didn't read my comment when I clearly stated boundaries meaning she is not going there with her bf she is going there by herself and IF she gets the free time to tag along with them she will. But don't have your hopes up type situation. You're making it sound like I said yes do exactly what he says and let him decide if he wants to follow you around like a lost puppy. Far from what I meant. Where he can tag along a buddy there and not only can he actually have a friend's trip there but also might see his gf there working which is double the fun. This could of had been communicated way better and I also understand her wanting to go there alone professionally. But I also wouldn't say no to my gf if she could afford the trip by herself and understood the boundaries. You're making it sound like she'll carry him around like those chihuahuas in a bag. Chill.", "Someone pointed out in Japan accommodations are paid for per person and not per room - so the hotel wouldn't even be free for him anyway.", "A conference is not at all the same as a work trip where you are meeting with different people at the client company and actually working on the project not just attending lectures and networking. If the client wants to take the team to dinner after a day of work to discuss the filming direction for the next day, you go and don't drag a bf along.", "Sounds like the issue is that he\u2019ll be doing all the fun stuff while she has to work so they can\u2019t experience it together and she\u2019ll have to listen about all the things she\u2019s missing out on while working. I\u2019ve asked a SO to not come on trips because they\u2019d want to do things together that I\u2019d have to keep saying no to; like they figured we could do all the fun stuff in the evenings and didn\u2019t like that I pointed out I\u2019d need those to prepare for the next day\u2019s meetings or go to networking dinners and the like.", "Yeah, it happens all the time.  People have no idea what really goes on, many would be shocked. Three doctors in the family. Some of these people never go anywhere alone, they always have a tag along.", "That sounds exhausting!  You should never have to baby his feeling all the time!  Where is the space for your feelings?  Do you have space?  Did you see the Barbie Movie?  Because he is vibing very like Ken.", "Tell him your word is final and if he can't understand he can pay for himself, stay at a hotel he got for himself and enjoy the city by himself because you will be unavailable.", "Not according to her comments", "You seem to have skipped over the multiple times she said in post and comments that he keeps INSISTING that he\u2019s going to spend the trip WITH her and follow her around no matter how many times she says no! She communicated, he just doesn\u2019t care and isn\u2019t listening. She will be carrying him around like a dog in a bag because he refuses her boundaries! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThis is her work! He also expects to, again, stay at the hotel her EMPLOYER IS PAYING FOR!!!!! \ud83d\ude02 That alone could get her in trouble! There is no hope at all she\u2019s told him that and he, along with all of you in the comments, seem to think you know her schedule better than she does and her bf better than she does. It\u2019s crazy to me. She can\u2019t offer other solutions because he\u2019s INSISTING on doing what HE wants! She shouldn\u2019t even HAVE to compromise! This is her work trip, not a chance for him to have a vacation. It\u2019s 100% valid for her to want it to be about HER and NOT about him when it\u2019s, again, HER CAREER. You also skip over the fact that they don\u2019t have the money for him to be doing this!!!", "I just got home from accompanying my wife on a trip for her PhD. However, she was specifically told that I was welcome to attend the lectures, so that's what I did. I even attended some that she was unable to.", "I'm in an industry where I could bring my husband along on a work trip, but I absolutely never would.  Nothing burns me out like socializing with a bunch of new people - and work trips are a stressful work day combined with dozens of new people combined with being my most outgoing best work personally.  By the end of the day I want to crawl into my hotel room and be completely utterly alone.  I wouldn't want to be touched or have to socialize or share a bed at all.  I imagine a model would be super touched out at the end of a work day.", ">because lunches, dinners, and evening events are for networking.\n\nThat is a key part of making that work. So many spouses and partners assume they can share the time not part of the official function, but as you say, that networking time is very important, too, and easily thwarted by an extra person tagging along.", "That's op tho. Op gets to decide what they want. I mean from the employer pov it shouldn't matter to them.", "Op has every right to not want them there. \nI was talking about from the employer pov I don't see why THEY would care as long as op does their job properly.", "How do you know that? I didn't read that he expected her to do anything with him. The way it sounded to me was he wants to come and do his own thing.", "If you read the thread correctly which id assume when she says he can pay for his trip but he just wants to stay in the same accomodation which again would mean same hotel not piggy back off the employeer. You seem very fun at parties. Your username is the face and sound you'll make when you realize what she and I meant. Nonnyyyyyy", "Wait\u2026 did I just read someone on reddit change their mind when presented with new information?! And THEN\u2026 that person still gets downvoted\u2026", "What are ya gonna do lol oh well"]}
