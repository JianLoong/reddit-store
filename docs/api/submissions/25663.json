All these people commenting they went on work trips, they didn't attend the actual conferences they did things together afterwards. If you've already been told he can't join you at the shoots and meetings he's behaving like a stage 5 clingon.", "A work dinner is a work dinner. Then he can not go to that, if she has time after work they can do stuff together. Or not. It\u2019s really not that hard.", "OP posted above he just wants to follow her around while she's working. That's not okay.", "It\u2019s the employers sunk cost and OP doesn\u2019t have their permission to have her bf in her room. It\u2019s unprofessional.", "You\u2019re thinking in \u201cdesk/office/9-5 work\u201d and not in \u201cOP probably could even have to shoot at midnight and stay there at after hours because the shots and editorial demanded it\u201d.", "Was already mentioned by another past model that this would look bad and unlikely to get more gigs in Asia in the future. \n\nSo apparently people do care and it will affect her job.", "That\u2019s not true and you know it \ud83d\ude44", "OP has already explained her boyfriend expects to spend all his time with her, and go to her jobs with her. He wants to tag along, basically. This will tank her career.", "Didn\u2019t see that. Agreed in that case that\u2019s not okay.", "Then it's a simple no. \n\nIn Japan accommodation is usually paid per person not per room. Your company is not going to be forking out twice as much for accommodation so your partner can stay with you. So he will need his own accommodation. \n\nAs you will be busy working (Japan is not known for its short working hours), he needs to realise it will be a solo trip for him. At best you could maybe go on the same flights but that would be it. \n\nTell him you'd rather save up and go at a time when you can both enjoy a holiday because otherwise he'll be leaving you out of the experience of seeing Japan.  \n\nDo not let him bully you into agreeing because likely he will crack the sads at the end of the trip because \"you didn't spend enough time with him\".", "You\u2019re right, no permission is a very important point. I work for a company that has a major US presence, but HQ is in Paris, France. It is not uncommon for employees to ask if a spouse can tag along, but with the understanding that the company is only paying for the hotel and the employee has to take care of the same work responsibilities they\u2019d have to cover if the spouse was not there.", "Well then yeah I agree that\u2019s absurd. I didn\u2019t read the comments", "OP literally says the boyfriend wants to act like he\u2019s her PA, experience everything with her together, go everywhere she goes.", "\"No, you are not qualified for a PA role in the model industry. And if you were you would understand why what you're asking is unthinkable. Do not ask again.\"", "Was not advocating that the boyfriend act as her PA, just trying to answer why people are \u201cassuming\u201d the BF would show up. A good PA is an irreplaceable, magical creature that controls your life, but in a beneficial way. Boyfriend would make a mess of it in America or wherever OP is from, adding a foreign language, industry,  and customs exponentially increases the chance of everything going FUBAR.", "Oh I know! I was just imagining a response I would give to bf if I was OP.\n\nHonestly, it's very controlling that he insists on being present not just in the country but throughout her work day too."]}
