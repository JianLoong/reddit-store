You\u2019re not crying over the gifts. You\u2019re crying over not being heard or understood. Valid response and I\u2019m sorry they aren\u2019t listening to you.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is wrong with your parents? Why would they think you would like this stuff? Are they trying to change who you are somehow? Or impose their own hobbies on you?\n\nYour parents are thoughtless jerks, bad gift-givers, and this is a parenting fail. You should be ungrateful. And THEY ruined YOUR day. They should be making it up to you, not sending you to your room. Get the receipts, take the gifts back, and exchange them.", "NTA. If it was from anyone else, like a grandparent or acquaintance, I'd say just accept the gifts gracefully, but this is your parents! They should know the bare minimum about what you're interested in! If they insist on getting you things *they* think you should like instead of anything even remotely related to your actual interests, then they should be ready for the consequences of you being unhappy.", "NTA.\n\n1. You told them what you wanted.\n\n2. They have been doing this for years.\n\n3. You are 16.\n\nIf you were a full grown adult by answer would be different but at 16, your emotional regulation is still in development and a big disappointed feeling like this will easily overwhelm what you know to be the 'polite' thing to do\n\nTake some time to calm down, deep breaths, draw your feelings, whatever helps you.\n\nAnd then consider writing your parents a letter, explaining what you've explained here, and that while you're aware of the money they've spent and you're grateful that they're willing to spend so much, you'd like gifts that line up more with your interests.\n\nWriting it down helps make sure you're not simply speaking out of emotion and help you get your point across without sounding like you're 'whining' (which I doubt you do as you sound perfectly eloquent in your post, but it makes it more difficult to accuse you of being so)\n\nEverything crossed that once you're able to express to your parents properly, you get those pens you wanted!", "NTA. \"You ruined the day\" - if they didn't want it ruined for them, maybe they should have listened to you.", "NTA. A gift isn't given for the giver, but for the recipient of the gift. Your parents are showing you that they don't respect your individuality. And like the other recent post about a teenage girl who received girly gifts from her dad when she has a distinctly unisex style, they're trying to funnel you into a certain presentation that they see as more typically masculine.", "NTA. Your parents suck. The true worth of a gift doesn\u2019t lie in its monetary value, but in the sentiment it carries. Giving a gift shouldn't feel like a checkbox, it's about showing someone they matter. It\u2019s about bringing them joy by giving them something we know they would love. If you purposely grab something they hate, it's like a neon sign saying, \"I didn't really care.\" Money spent? Irrelevant. Care given? That's the real currency.\n\nI don\u2019t think that crying over the wrong gift in this situation is about being picky. You cried about the message it carried. Cause it felt like your parents didn't really get you, treating your birthday more like a chore than a chance to make you happy and show they care about what you're into. Expecting our loved ones to genuinely want to make us happy isn\u2019t entitlement, it\u2019s a natural desire for connection and understanding.", "NTA.  You weren't crying over the actual gifts, you were crying because your parents are inconsiderate and don't value enough to listen.  You did not ruin the day, your parents did.  You did NOTHING WRONG!  It does appear that this isn't going to change and you may want to think about requesting that they no longer give you any gifts.  If this is the way you decide to go, then always celebrate with your fiends and other family member (if any) who actually cares and listens to your wants and wishes.  You can make your own family.", "NTA. This sounds like a usual case of them trying to force traditional values on you. Your tears are justified. They refuse to understand you and accept your interests.\n\nWhy are they upset at you for \"ruining the day\"? It's your party, you can cry if you want to.\n\nNext time, just ask for money so you can use it on whatever you like.", "Definitely NTA. That\u2019s really awful and disappointing. \n\nI know what I am about to say won\u2019t help the fact that your parents don\u2019t pay attention to who you really are, but maybe tell them from now on, you would prefer money or gift cards to Amazon or something that allows you to shop for yourself.", "Sell them and get those mother clucking pens. Nta", "NTA I love, love to read. When I was 15 all I wanted was books. I didn\u2018t care if they were used, from yard sales, whatever. Did I get any books? Nope! Did I get a random, expensive brass lamp, you betcha. Over 30 years later, still haven\u2019t received any books.", "NTA. Return the gifts to the stores if you can get cash (not a refund to your parent's credit card),  or sell them to sports-minded kids after school. \n\nThen go buy the pen set you like. Have a close friend or loving relative hold them when you are not using them in case your parents learn you sold their gifts and get upset.", "NTA - This is sad to read.\n\nHow much are the pens? Redditors let\u2019s unite and get this lad the pens he wants!!", "Normally I would say if someone gave you a gift you don't like, then just accept that you have different tastes and that it was the thought that counts and move on. But in this case NTA. \n\nYou have told your parents repeatedly that sports are not something you are interested in. They are showing their disapproval by giving you more 'manly' gifts to try to convert you into being who they want you to be instead of who you are. \n\nI'm sorry you lost control and cried. You must be really embarrassed. But you aren't at fault for feeling this way or for expressing that emotion. I'm sorry you have parents who don't love you for who you are. Just two more years until you can move out and then you'll be able to dictate the terms of your relationship.", "NTA. Yes you should be grateful for what you are given, however, if you are repeatedly telling them that the things they are getting you don\u2019t interest you at all and will not be used they shouldn\u2019t keep getting you those things. Every single birthday for 16 years would get frustrating, and it almost seems like they are trying to push that on you and make you pursue an interest that is completely unappealing to you.", "NTA\n\nIt's not really the thought that counts when no thought has gone into what you would like.  I would imagine your tears were tears of frustration at not being listened to.\n\nDid they explain why they bought you sports-related gifts which you have never shown any interest in?", "NTA. We can't really demand the gifts we'll get but they are clearly disregarding your feelings considering this isn't the first time. Normal parents would try to give something their child likes. I would be disappointed too.", "NTA. You don't have to show fake gratitude for treatment that mocks you. Giving you sports paraphenalia when you are not the least interested in sport is a mockery. They clearly want you to be someone or something you are not. Your parents will have themselves to thank for it when you cut them off as an adult.", "NTA but your parents are.", "Return the gift and get what you want. I\u2019ve had to do that with my ex husband. It\u2019s sad that the people we love don\u2019t listen to what you answer to their questions of what do you want for your birthday.", "NTA. While you're not necessarily entitled to any type of gift and should generally be grateful, repeatedly telling them you're not into sports while they keep buying you sports stuff is really inconsiderate and manipulative on their part. You can't always help your feelings and it does feel like a gut punch to constantly be given a gift that doesn't suit you. I'm sorry your parents ruined your birthday and blamed you for it. You did nothing wrong. You just had an emotional reaction after years of built up tension.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are a bunch of narcs. Sorry kid.", "I have a feeling this is not how it went exactly, but based on your narration alone, NTA.  \nThey are probably frustrated and you might need to talk more with them about your interests and try to make them understand why and how can they support you better.", "NTA, when I was 13, I received a baseball mitt as my only birthday present. One, I'm a girl, two, I am short and definitely not sports inclined. Do this day, I have no idea what my parents where thinking.", "You\u2019re 16 bite the bullet 2 more years and buy your own gifts for yourself, NTA\u2026.but I wouldn\u2019t open/ask for anymore, sounds like your parents are trying to make you something you are not..you can tell them how you feel before going no contact because they sound unhinged.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is not the typical \"so being a spoiled brat and be thankful\" gift post.  You asked for something specific.

Like only girls can like art, or what's their deal?", "it really feels like some covert way of them trying to make you more \"masculine\", like they're silently homophobic/transphobic and don't want you doing anything they view as feminine.

They have this imaginary idea of you that likes sports and would love those gifts. This image of what they think you should be is very different from who and how you ARE. Even now, they think you \"should\" think, feel and act like their imaginary you. Even as the pain their rejection causes you flooded out before them, their reaction was that you \"should be grateful.\"\n\nThe unwanted gift is a manipulation tactic where the \"gift\" is to pressure the recipient to do something they do not want to do. The manipulator uses the cost and effort they expended on the unwanted gift to make the unwilling receiver use and/or show appreciation for the gift using to fear, obligation and/or guilt.\n\nIs one or both of your parents into the things they keep giving you? Are the gifts meant to put you into a role they want and you don't? I wonder why they got stuck on the particular non-interests of yours that they repeatedly buy.\n\nWhat REALLY matters is that your parents are using gifting occasions to show they don't accept, value and support YOU. They keep getting gifts for a \"you\" that doesn't exist. That looks like the imagined, different \"you\" is the only version they accept, support and love.

On my birthday I didn't get anything from my list, but the couple of things I did get were at the same price point as the things I asked for. I cried because it felt like my parents didn't care enough about me to get me something I wanted, even a cheaper gift.

It's sadly very common for parents to view their kids as property and not as human beings with thoughts and feelings of their own. Also, it's probably an attempt to make you \"man up.\" They might not think you're gay (at least not consciously), but they probably have some sexist ideas swirling around in their heads about how you can't be a \"real man\" unless you're into sports. I'm sorry you're going through this. My family did the same to me when I was growing up. It sucks, and it has led to me hating gifts and holidays, even 20 years later. Now I have kids of my own, and I refuse to do the same to my children.

This could be for a variety of reasons the most postive being that they like sports and want you to like them too so you can all enjoy them together but just DGAF that that isn't who you are.\n\nAnother likely reason is less postive, by any chance have your parent's ever expressed any homophobia? See, you say you like to draw and are more interested in arts you hate sports and you also cried when you were upset NONE OF WHICH IS WRONG OR MAKES YOU LESS OR MORE THAN MAN OR MEANS YOU ARE QUEER. It is absolutely perfectly normal and healthy for a heterosexual male to be sensitive, emotional and like art more than sports. However naive, backwards and homophobic people often mistakenly  view these more \"feminine\" characteristics as proof of homosexuality so they try and \"make\" you straight. It's incredibly common for homophobic parents (and many might be the \"gay is fine as long it's no one in my family\" type) to do this sort of thing, gifting kids traditional gender oriented gifts like girly pink dresses and makeup for the tomboy that rocks flannel and jeans and sports crap for the more artistic boy.\n\nNow, wheather or not they think you are queer doesn't matter, that isn't the issue here your sexuality, wheather you are queer straight bi whatever is nobodies business but your own and you never have to confirm or deny your orientation to anyone unless you want to either to us here or your parents the issue is that your parent's need to accept and support you for who you are and respect your interests. \n\nYou must never assume that your children will be who you want them to be, you can hope that they'll be the jock you can talk sports with as you toss the pigskin or whatever but you must never expect it. \n\nI would suggest telling your parents \"I'm sorry for getting upset when you spent all this money on sports gifts for me (I know you shouldn't have to because you had every right to cry but this will open the door and make them more willing to listen to you) but I don't like sports I keep telling you and you keep doing this and it makes me feel like you don't listen to me or care about what I like and that is very hurtful.\" I would also suggest you ask them \"Why do you keep buying me these sports things when you know I don't like them?
