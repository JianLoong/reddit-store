You\u2019re not crying over the gifts. You\u2019re crying over not being heard or understood. Valid response and I\u2019m sorry they aren\u2019t listening to you.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is wrong with your parents? Why would they think you would like this stuff? Are they trying to change who you are somehow? Or impose their own hobbies on you?\n\nYour parents are thoughtless jerks, bad gift-givers, and this is a parenting fail. You should be ungrateful. And THEY ruined YOUR day. They should be making it up to you, not sending you to your room. Get the receipts, take the gifts back, and exchange them.", "NTA. If it was from anyone else, like a grandparent or acquaintance, I'd say just accept the gifts gracefully, but this is your parents! They should know the bare minimum about what you're interested in! If they insist on getting you things *they* think you should like instead of anything even remotely related to your actual interests, then they should be ready for the consequences of you being unhappy.", "NTA.\n\n1. You told them what you wanted.\n\n2. They have been doing this for years.\n\n3. You are 16.\n\nIf you were a full grown adult by answer would be different but at 16, your emotional regulation is still in development and a big disappointed feeling like this will easily overwhelm what you know to be the 'polite' thing to do\n\nTake some time to calm down, deep breaths, draw your feelings, whatever helps you.\n\nAnd then consider writing your parents a letter, explaining what you've explained here, and that while you're aware of the money they've spent and you're grateful that they're willing to spend so much, you'd like gifts that line up more with your interests.\n\nWriting it down helps make sure you're not simply speaking out of emotion and help you get your point across without sounding like you're 'whining' (which I doubt you do as you sound perfectly eloquent in your post, but it makes it more difficult to accuse you of being so)\n\nEverything crossed that once you're able to express to your parents properly, you get those pens you wanted!", "NTA. \"You ruined the day\" - if they didn't want it ruined for them, maybe they should have listened to you.", "NTA. A gift isn't given for the giver, but for the recipient of the gift. Your parents are showing you that they don't respect your individuality. And like the other recent post about a teenage girl who received girly gifts from her dad when she has a distinctly unisex style, they're trying to funnel you into a certain presentation that they see as more typically masculine.", "NTA. Your parents suck. The true worth of a gift doesn\u2019t lie in its monetary value, but in the sentiment it carries. Giving a gift shouldn't feel like a checkbox, it's about showing someone they matter. It\u2019s about bringing them joy by giving them something we know they would love. If you purposely grab something they hate, it's like a neon sign saying, \"I didn't really care.\" Money spent? Irrelevant. Care given? That's the real currency.\n\nI don\u2019t think that crying over the wrong gift in this situation is about being picky. You cried about the message it carried. Cause it felt like your parents didn't really get you, treating your birthday more like a chore than a chance to make you happy and show they care about what you're into. Expecting our loved ones to genuinely want to make us happy isn\u2019t entitlement, it\u2019s a natural desire for connection and understanding.", "NTA.  You weren't crying over the actual gifts, you were crying because your parents are inconsiderate and don't value enough to listen.  You did not ruin the day, your parents did.  You did NOTHING WRONG!  It does appear that this isn't going to change and you may want to think about requesting that they no longer give you any gifts.  If this is the way you decide to go, then always celebrate with your fiends and other family member (if any) who actually cares and listens to your wants and wishes.  You can make your own family.", "NTA. This sounds like a usual case of them trying to force traditional values on you. Your tears are justified. They refuse to understand you and accept your interests.\n\nWhy are they upset at you for \"ruining the day\"? It's your party, you can cry if you want to.\n\nNext time, just ask for money so you can use it on whatever you like.", "Definitely NTA. That\u2019s really awful and disappointing. \n\nI know what I am about to say won\u2019t help the fact that your parents don\u2019t pay attention to who you really are, but maybe tell them from now on, you would prefer money or gift cards to Amazon or something that allows you to shop for yourself.", "Sell them and get those mother clucking pens. Nta", "NTA I love, love to read. When I was 15 all I wanted was books. I didn\u2018t care if they were used, from yard sales, whatever. Did I get any books? Nope! Did I get a random, expensive brass lamp, you betcha. Over 30 years later, still haven\u2019t received any books.", "NTA. Return the gifts to the stores if you can get cash (not a refund to your parent's credit card),  or sell them to sports-minded kids after school. \n\nThen go buy the pen set you like. Have a close friend or loving relative hold them when you are not using them in case your parents learn you sold their gifts and get upset.", "NTA - This is sad to read.\n\nHow much are the pens? Redditors let\u2019s unite and get this lad the pens he wants!!", "Normally I would say if someone gave you a gift you don't like, then just accept that you have different tastes and that it was the thought that counts and move on. But in this case NTA. \n\nYou have told your parents repeatedly that sports are not something you are interested in. They are showing their disapproval by giving you more 'manly' gifts to try to convert you into being who they want you to be instead of who you are. \n\nI'm sorry you lost control and cried. You must be really embarrassed. But you aren't at fault for feeling this way or for expressing that emotion. I'm sorry you have parents who don't love you for who you are. Just two more years until you can move out and then you'll be able to dictate the terms of your relationship.", "NTA. Yes you should be grateful for what you are given, however, if you are repeatedly telling them that the things they are getting you don\u2019t interest you at all and will not be used they shouldn\u2019t keep getting you those things. Every single birthday for 16 years would get frustrating, and it almost seems like they are trying to push that on you and make you pursue an interest that is completely unappealing to you.", "NTA\n\nIt's not really the thought that counts when no thought has gone into what you would like.  I would imagine your tears were tears of frustration at not being listened to.\n\nDid they explain why they bought you sports-related gifts which you have never shown any interest in?", "NTA. We can't really demand the gifts we'll get but they are clearly disregarding your feelings considering this isn't the first time. Normal parents would try to give something their child likes. I would be disappointed too.", "NTA. You don't have to show fake gratitude for treatment that mocks you. Giving you sports paraphenalia when you are not the least interested in sport is a mockery. They clearly want you to be someone or something you are not. Your parents will have themselves to thank for it when you cut them off as an adult.", "NTA but your parents are.", "Return the gift and get what you want. I\u2019ve had to do that with my ex husband. It\u2019s sad that the people we love don\u2019t listen to what you answer to their questions of what do you want for your birthday.", "NTA. While you're not necessarily entitled to any type of gift and should generally be grateful, repeatedly telling them you're not into sports while they keep buying you sports stuff is really inconsiderate and manipulative on their part. You can't always help your feelings and it does feel like a gut punch to constantly be given a gift that doesn't suit you. I'm sorry your parents ruined your birthday and blamed you for it. You did nothing wrong. You just had an emotional reaction after years of built up tension.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are a bunch of narcs. Sorry kid.", "I have a feeling this is not how it went exactly, but based on your narration alone, NTA.  \nThey are probably frustrated and you might need to talk more with them about your interests and try to make them understand why and how can they support you better.", "NTA, when I was 13, I received a baseball mitt as my only birthday present. One, I'm a girl, two, I am short and definitely not sports inclined. Do this day, I have no idea what my parents where thinking.", "You\u2019re 16 bite the bullet 2 more years and buy your own gifts for yourself, NTA\u2026.but I wouldn\u2019t open/ask for anymore, sounds like your parents are trying to make you something you are not..you can tell them how you feel before going no contact because they sound unhinged.", "\r  \nNTA, girl, you're totally valid for feeling upset. It's frustrating when your folks don't get your interests, especially when you've been clear about what you want. Crying might've been a bit much, but emotions are real, and it's not like you asked for the moon. Hopefully, they'll realize and make it up to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents are awful. Unless this will put you in danger, sell the sports stuff and buy art supplies.", "I'm so sorry for you. To tell you that you are ungrateful after knowingly giving you a gift you would have ZERO interest in is horrible and IMHO gaslighting. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Grateful for what, getting gifts your parents should know you'll never actually use?  Their actions make it look like they either don't care who you are or think you should be someone else more in line with some arbitrary ideal of theirs.  Sucky parenting on their part either way.", "NTA. Your parents are trying to groom you into the son they want. Tell them you are not that person, and that you never will be that person.\n\nThen donate any sports equipment they give you to a youth center.", "NTA. I'm sad reading this. \n\nEither your parents have no idea what you like and dislike, or your parents wish you didn't like art and liked sports instead. Neither reflects well on them, and it's absolutely true that they didn't listen to you.\n\nHappy birthday anyway.\n\nWhat pens did you ask for, by the way?", "NTA. This is not the typical \"so being a spoiled brat and be thankful\" gift post.  You asked for something specific.  Your parents KNOW you don't like sports, yet they continue to disregard your feelings and interests and get you gifts they know you have no interest in.\n\nIs this a gender thing for them? Like only girls can like art, or what's their deal?", "it really feels like some covert way of them trying to make you more \"masculine\", like they're silently homophobic/transphobic and don't want you doing anything they view as feminine. NTA  \n\n\nthough this sub is fucking appalling sometimes. these people were calling a girl an ungrateful asshole just yesterday for being ungrateful when her dad was giving her fairly questionable gifts for her birthday and she very much didn't want them either.", "NTA. You've told your parents what you wanted and that you don't like sports, and they're still buying you sports stuff.  Ask for the receipts so you can return that stuff and get what you want. Or sell them. \n\nOh, and be sure to get them sports stuff for Christmas, since *they* obviously like sports so much.", "NTA\nYour feelings are hurt because your parents AGAIN and still used your birthday to show they don't support your personality, interests and talents but rather, want you to be a different person than you are.\n\nThey didn't give YOU, real you, any gifts. They have this imaginary idea of you that likes sports and would love those gifts. This image of what they think you should be is very different from who and how you ARE. Even now, they think you \"should\" think, feel and act like their imaginary you. Even as the pain their rejection causes you flooded out before them, their reaction was that you \"should be grateful.\"\n\nThe unwanted gift is a manipulation tactic where the \"gift\" is to pressure the recipient to do something they do not want to do. The manipulator uses the cost and effort they expended on the unwanted gift to make the unwilling receiver use and/or show appreciation for the gift using to fear, obligation and/or guilt.\n\nIs one or both of your parents into the things they keep giving you? Are the gifts meant to put you into a role they want and you don't? I wonder why they got stuck on the particular non-interests of yours that they repeatedly buy.\n\nWhat REALLY matters is that your parents are using gifting occasions to show they don't accept, value and support YOU. They keep getting gifts for a \"you\" that doesn't exist. That looks like the imagined, different \"you\" is the only version they accept, support and love. That's hurtful, rejecting, devaluing to actual real you, who they believe isn't worth their attention, effort, and gifts.", "NTA. your parents sucks ass.", "yeah honestly have no idea why they keep getting me this stuff. thank you", "Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but I\u2019d even go as far as calling it homophobia, internalized or not.
