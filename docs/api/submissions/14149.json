She got caught in her own subterfuge.", "NTA. you didn't even report it, you just said yes when they asked if she had a dog. part of being a pet owner is paying for things like deposits and pet rent. she should've done what she's supposed to do and it isn't your fault they accidentally found out when you told the truth.", "NTA\n\nYou went through the system properly, your roommate didn\u2019t. If they want to play stupid games they can win stupid prizes.", "NTA, you didn't report her. \n\nYou were fined and accused of something you didn't do, so you rightfully called the complex and they asked you a question, which you truthfully answered. \n\nThe only AH here is your roommate.", "NTA. You had no idea your roommate had never registered the dog. You weren\u2019t home during the inspection, so was your roommate? If your roommate was home then I think there\u2019s a question of was the email actually an error or did she say the dog is yours to avoid the fine? It is plausible for the roommate to say the dog was yours thinking you\u2019d then go to the office to address it, they\u2019d confirm you have a registered pet, and then they\u2019d just drop the fee. (I\u2019m not saying it was a good plan, but I can see how they\u2019d think that would get them out of the fee.)", "NTA you got a bill that you didn't owe. all you were doing was clearing it up because you had done your bit. it's all on her for not being a responsible pet owener", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t do it put of spite. They asked a question and you answered honestly, thinking the dog was registered.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you called the leasing office unprompted, but they literally were going to fine you. Your pet is registered and hers is not. She should have taken the dog out while they were inspecting if she wanted to keep the dog a secret. You had no idea she didn't register the dog, and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. That dog is her responsibility she should have registered it and pay for it. If you didn't go to the front office, you would end up paying fine yourself which is not ok.", "NTA she didn't pay the fees. Pretty cut and dry. You didn't run to the office to report it and they would have assumed the dog was yours if you left out that detail and you would be paying those fees.", "If she'd asked OP to lie, or even let them know it was an unregistered pet, that would be one thing. (Not that you're obligated to lie just because someone asks.) But no one can be expected to lie about something they didn't even know needed lying about.", "Both of my pets are illegal residents, but I made that decision fully aware that there's a chance I'll get caught and have to pay.\n\nI've got roommates and everyone was very aware of the situation before the cats were acquired.\n\nNot paying exorbitant pet fees is fine. Hiding it from the people you live with is shitty.", "I agree, it's considerate to let your roommates know at the very least. \n\nBut I feel you, I had to pay an $800 deposit plus pay an extra $20 per month to have my cat in my apartment. And yes, that deposit is additional, on top of my other $800 deposit for \"in case of damages\" when I moved in. Straight up thievery. \n\nI'd rather take my chances of getting caught and pay a $250 fine.", "Lol, NTA.  The roommate screwed up and should be fined heavily.", "NTA", "NTA. You had no way of knowing your roommate didn't register her dog with the complex. Please don't feel bad over a misunderstanding you could not control", "NTA.", "Nta. You didn't even really report it, in my opinion. They discovered the pet during an inspection.You just told the truth so you didn't have to pay their fine. You did and paid everything you were supposed to for your pet. She knew she was supposed to pay a fee and chose to take the chance on getting caught. She failed.", "& as a former apartment manager, they would have found out eventually. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t confirm that you told so I hope the office doesn\u2019t either to keep things from getting awkward. \n\nAlso, the office has to notify you before entering which means she had time to remove the dog and his belongings.
