She got caught in her own subterfuge.", "NTA. you didn't even report it, you just said yes when they asked if she had a dog. part of being a pet owner is paying for things like deposits and pet rent. she should've done what she's supposed to do and it isn't your fault they accidentally found out when you told the truth.", "NTA\n\nYou went through the system properly, your roommate didn\u2019t. If they want to play stupid games they can win stupid prizes.", "NTA, you didn't report her. \n\nYou were fined and accused of something you didn't do, so you rightfully called the complex and they asked you a question, which you truthfully answered. \n\nThe only AH here is your roommate.", "NTA. You had no idea your roommate had never registered the dog. You weren\u2019t home during the inspection, so was your roommate? If your roommate was home then I think there\u2019s a question of was the email actually an error or did she say the dog is yours to avoid the fine? It is plausible for the roommate to say the dog was yours thinking you\u2019d then go to the office to address it, they\u2019d confirm you have a registered pet, and then they\u2019d just drop the fee. (I\u2019m not saying it was a good plan, but I can see how they\u2019d think that would get them out of the fee.)", "NTA you got a bill that you didn't owe. all you were doing was clearing it up because you had done your bit. it's all on her for not being a responsible pet owener", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t do it put of spite. They asked a question and you answered honestly, thinking the dog was registered.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you called the leasing office unprompted, but they literally were going to fine you. Your pet is registered and hers is not. She should have taken the dog out while they were inspecting if she wanted to keep the dog a secret. You had no idea she didn't register the dog, and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. That dog is her responsibility she should have registered it and pay for it. If you didn't go to the front office, you would end up paying fine yourself which is not ok.", "NTA she didn't pay the fees. Pretty cut and dry. You didn't run to the office to report it and they would have assumed the dog was yours if you left out that detail and you would be paying those fees.", "If she'd asked OP to lie, or even let them know it was an unregistered pet, that would be one thing.

Hiding it from the people you live with is shitty.", "I agree, it's considerate to let your roommates know at the very least. \n\nBut I feel you, I had to pay an $800 deposit plus pay an extra $20 per month to have my cat in my apartment. And yes, that deposit is additional, on top of my other $800 deposit for \"in case of damages\" when I moved in. Straight up thievery. \n\nI'd rather take my chances of getting caught and pay a $250 fine.", "Lol, NTA.  The roommate screwed up and should be fined heavily.", "NTA", "NTA.

You didn't even really report it, in my opinion. They discovered the pet during an inspection.You just told the truth so you didn't have to pay their fine. You did and paid everything you were supposed to for your pet. She knew she was supposed to pay a fee and chose to take the chance on getting caught. She failed.", "& as a former apartment manager, they would have found out eventually. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t confirm that you told so I hope the office doesn\u2019t either to keep things from getting awkward. \n\nAlso, the office has to notify you before entering which means she had time to remove the dog and his belongings. NTA", "Meh, I\u2019m for pet fees.", "Not paying pet fees is shitty too.", "Haha, good one!", "NTA.  The unregistered pet is a lease violation.  Since they emailed you, ask if they will remove the email from your rental history.  You don't want that hanging on you when you look for a new place.  Responsible pet owners pay the deposit, fees, and pet rent.  When you move out, get them to do a walk through with you and have them confirm that the damage was not done by your cat.  That way, you protect your deposit.", "NTA\n\nYou mistakenly thought your roommate was following the rules.\n\nYou're lucky they aren't kicking you out for her violation of the lease.", "NTA\n\nYou mistakenly thought your roommate was following the rules.\n\nYou're lucky they aren't kicking you out for her violation of the lease.", "NTA, even if you didn\u2019t know, that dog was going to be found out eventually.

That carpet will have to be replaced, not just professionally cleaned, pet smells are hard to remove, etc. It's fair to charge more for pets. $20/month is nothing.", "NTA. I know someone who didn't pay the pet fee and the apartment found out after a couple years and they had to pay $600 on top of their rent for the month. And they were warned.\n\nYou shouldn't have to pay for your roommate's problem and you don't need to jeopardize your living situation with the management.", "NTA, well if it isnt the consequences of her own actions, eh?", "I'm over the pet limit for my city, but only my dogs and one cat are on the record.

My cat uses her covered litter box and does not mark or scratch walls.  I completely understand having a pet deposit but there is no way I\u2019d pay an extra monthly fee.
