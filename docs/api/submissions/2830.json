You start to get an uneasy feeling when you see that stuff a lot, so the word starts to have a negative connotation.\n\nEDIT: weird, your reply to this comment came up in my notifs and I can see your reply on your profile, but it won't come up when I click on it, so I don't really know what you said, I apologize.", "Biggest lie in all these words is probably your username", "Found another comment, looks like she means her savings and didn\u2019t use the right words maybe.  Says her father has financially cut her off.", "No, you say, \u201cwomen and girls,\u201d to specify age. Nobody says \u201cfemale humans\u201d unless in it\u2019s in a biological or anthropological context. Which this isn\u2019t.", "It\u2019s pretty common knowledge that the word female is used in this way by incels and misogynists. \n\nYour ignorance of that doesn\u2019t make it any less true.", "Out of interest do they also say \u201cmale\u201d more than men? And whereabouts do you live that speaks like that?", "An adjective is fine. In that case, it\u2019s a descriptor. But using it as a noun changes the tone and that tone is demeaning. Instead of being dismissive, try to approach the experiences of people speaking up with empathy.", "If you don\u2019t understand why, take a look at that sub. There are plenty of examples that explain why it bothers them.", "Nah it isn\u2019t, but I\u2019m curious tho. Are you also offended by words as huMAN, MANkind, freshMAN or MOTHERS day?", "Why are incels calling themselves incels then?\n\nIf you want to see actual hate terms, check out the phrases incels have made up to insult women.", "No you don't lol No one says \"boys and men\" or \"women and girls\" when males and females works perfectly fine and is correct. Right under the scientific definition is: a female person; a woman or girl.\n\"both males and females accumulate economic knowledge at a similar rate.\" It is also defined as both a noun and adjective. Sorry  you're irrationally angry at a word and let toxic incels rule your life \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Oh yeah this was not a devil's advocate thing, I am totally clear on it being demeaning. As I said I also hate when people do that. I was genuinely asking because I've been feeling squidgy even using it in that context but I couldn't find a better alternative. Thanks for humoring me with your thoughts!", "Girls, ladies, gals; \nboys, dudes, guys", "No.", "Are you offended by words such as Congressperson, Ms. and firefighter? How about deadbeat DAD?", "\u201cSorry if you\u2019re irrationally angry at the word \u2018blacks\u2019 and let toxic racists rule your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry if you\u2019re irrationally angry  at the word \u2018queers\u2019 and let toxic homophobes rule your life.\u201d\n\nSee how that sounds? Victim blaming isn\u2019t a good look.\n\nIf you can\u2019t approach this situation from a place of empathy, then that\u2019s on you.", "You're right, but people tend to weird out at random words for no apparent reason so you're fighting a losing battle, sorry.", "Female baby is correct; as is female toddler, female teen, and female population. All are grammatically correct uses of the adjective. If you were to go up to a baby and say \u201caww look at the little female\u201d that would be deeply weird.\n\nIf you were to call me a female I would automatically assume you were a misogynist until I saw evidence to the contrary. Which would be unlikely to happen since I\u2019d probably avoid you.", "No way you're comparing \"female\" to actual derogatory terms?? Lmao you're not a victim, and living your life trying to be one ain't it chief"]}
