It's just the 'latest' thing for some females to be offended by. It's not even grammatically correct to replace the word women for females. It is not inclusive of every female age group. Female babies are not women. Female toddlers are not women. Pre-teen and teen girls are not women. So, it actually is prejudiced against most of the Female population and excludes them.
