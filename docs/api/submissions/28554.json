She is - a big one. And while she probably drives everyone around her crazy, she is the biggest AH to herself. She actively keeps herself from achieving her goals by blaming everything on one external factor, i.e. \"fatphobia\". If she were going around and blaming everything going wrong on Jews, lizard conspiracies, Bill Gates, freemasonry or any other common \"scapegoat\", we'll call her delusional beyond measure. \n\nNo one is preventing her from losing weight or excelling at her job. And she wanted to lose weight in the first place, but stalled her progress and got resentful at yours. Worst combination ever.", "NTA. Of course people experience fatphobia but it sounds like she uses it as a crutch to push away rejection. It's a shame to lose a friend. Unfortunately, not many people have the strength to come around when called out but I hope she does.", "NTA. She tried to lose weight: she's fatphobic.", "NTA. Sounds like she took the shortcut and blames everyone for being \u2018fatphobic\u2019 instead of realizing that she may be the problem. Drop her like a quarter pounder with cheese from McDonald\u2019s and get on with your life.

Blame everything on fatphobia rather than actually lose the weight, because that is hard. Weight loss isn't a quick easy journey, and it takes time and dedication. Some people, your former friend included, just don't want to have to put the effort in, just give up and then lash out at everyone for the percieved slight of 'fatphobia'.", "NTA  you told her truth", "she is playing victim. no need to keep up with that behaviour.

She sounds toxic", "NTA, but I'm not sure exactly what you were expecting here... \n\nYou know she is combative and weight is clearly a touchy subject which makes her defensive. Of course, it's not fair of her to accuse the people around her of being bigoted with no proof, but it's not even like she's doing it to their faces. She was just venting to someone she considered a friend. \n\nTelling her to stop throwing around baseless accusations doesn't make you an asshole obviously but, like, I genuinely don't know what you were expecting her to do after that...", "You and your friend are Reddit friends. Sounds like you\u2019ve made this post specifically targeted at her seeing it. For that reason alone YTA.", "NTA. Unless you are actively holding her down and force feeding her, her size is not your fault and she needs to stop punishing you for your success. Well done for reaching your goal!", "NTA. Your former friend is using \u2018fat phobia\u2019 to hide behind instead of dealing with her own inadequacies.", "NTA, but that makes me fatphobic, too I guess. /s", "What I expected?

Ultimately, she\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to have to make the changes and put in work, just like you did. If she chooses to blame fatphobia for every bad thing in her life, that\u2019s on her. She\u2019s become a toxic person to you as a result, so now she can focus on her journey alone.\n\nCongrats on meeting your goal!"]}
