Knew a woman with mast cell syndrome (medically diagnosed) who couldn\u2019t lose weight on a 950 cal a day diet, and was then put on an anti-inflammatory years later and has lost over 80lbs without restricting.  \n\nBut accusing friends of being fatphobic when you, in particular, were walking on eggshells to be supportive is assholian.  Even if she wasn\u2019t able to lose weight for medical reasons, and you did lose weight, that doesn\u2019t mean that losing 150lbs is easy\u2014I\u2019m sure it was very difficult.

Sounds like you're well rid of her.", "NTA and please stop saying \u201csimular.\u201d That\u2019s not the word. Sim-ah-lur. Similar. Thanks.", "NAH.  I understand where she is coming from- some of the most judgmental fat-phobic people are people who used to be fat. I have no doubt you became difficult for her to be friends with due to you being in different places with your weight journey, a friendship based on weight is going to fail as soon as that changes for one of the people involved.", "NTA.  She sounds exhausting at this point.  She talks about losing weight and went on a weight loss subreddit so she's fatphobic too.", "NTA, cut her off. She is toxic\n\nI am fatphobic.... to myself! Been trying to lose weight and O blame myself, not others! I do joke my partner has been fattening me up, but it's that, a joke.\n\nI hate how I look and have been trying to stay active.\n\nYour friend needs to look at herself, not others.

As for how your message was delivered, it's impossible to say as I was not able to hear the conversation; all that is provided is your summary. In any case, you related the uncomfortable truth: we are responsible for ourselves. We are in charge of ourselves and our choices.\n\nBest to let this one go and not look back.", "nta  \n\nBut think of many friendships being like a walk through the woods, many paths, some paths cross and join for awhile and then part again.  \n\nI think you have just parted ways and it will be healthier for you to do so.", "NTA", "Lol I\u2019ll send her a box of donuts that spell out \u201cfatphobic,\u201d bet she\u2019ll be fine with it then", "I knew someone who would drink two frappucinos at a time, and then complain that she wasn't losing weight...it's amazing how people will lie to themselves.", "You're fat phobic", "We all know she didn't lose weight because f the Jewish space lasers.\n\nNTA to the OP.", "don't forget space lasers!!!", "This was my take, she probably is using it to soften the blow of rejection and try to help soothe her inner critic. I can assure you that she is feeling intense self shame seeing her friend accomplish her goals. While it\u2019s not an excuse to be passive-aggressive and a general jerk, I sadly understand how shame can have you lash out in this way. I had to go to go on a journey of self acceptance and body neutrality to let it go and let other people live how they want to live (edit:) free of judgment.\n\nAnd please don\u2019t just say she \u201cto step up and do something,\u201d that isn\u2019t always medically possible to do sustainably and healthfully. \n\nStill, fatphobia does exist and an unconscious bias that more people should explore. Why does she want to lose weight? Because she wants to fit in or for health reasons? That can tell you if she has internalized fatphobia and is lashing out.", "Yeh, fatphobia is real but it's most real at a systemic level. It doesn't mean every bad thing that happens to a fat person is a product of systemic oppression. That's just an actual victim complex.

And I\u2019m reflecting only on what you, OP, had control over, not a rough assessment of what your friend did or didn\u2019t do the right way as defined by Reddit strangers.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that your former friend was going through a difficult time, and had poor coping and accountability skills with it. (Sounds like a series of bad job interviews, bad dates, etc.) And had a new friend (you) who she didn\u2019t know how to bond with outside of complaining or venting. And this new friend had a similar-to-you health goal of losing weight and who found easier success with the work of it- that was probably hard for her to see. This, plus her passive aggression toward you, is a recipe for a new friendship to fall apart, which is what happened. And that\u2019s okay. \n\nBut back to your question- you share that you lost your temper (!), and the content of what you said involved fatness which is a clearly sensitive topic for this person.
