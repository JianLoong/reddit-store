While your friend may have indeed been the victim of some fatphobia she cannot use her weight as a scapegoat for everything.  Otherwise, as you've said, she will never grow and develop as a person.  There should be no reason why she can't lose at least some weight and make some improvements to her overall health and well-being.  Maybe she won't be able to be as successful as you were but she can still make some progress.
