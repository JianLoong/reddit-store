Unfortunately, you both fell back on the core topic of weight to keep you two together. You wanted her to meet a goal that you both shared at the start of the relationship. What she wanted might have been to have a friend who makes her feel understood in a world where fat people are treated like shit enough times to cause pain. Pain which I\u2019m sure you understand as well as she does. I\u2019m sure much of the shame and hurt you two experience is from how other people treat you like shit due to weight and for her to hear you repeat those same words back at her with *good* intentions doesn\u2019t help your friendship. \n\nTldr: I\u2019m giving an ESH because both of you wanted a friend and have/had a chance to build on it beyond the original goal of weight-loss but both of you have been using the least effective ways doing so.

But she can't handle those feelings so she bottles them up and gets angry at people around her instead.\n\nIf your friendship is important to you, you could encourage her to look into why she isn't losing weight.

It isn't healthy to be passively doomscrolling through non-productive social media, nor sitting on your ass gaming or watching football or going to church, *nor eating diets full of cheaply produced fat, salt, and sugar in caloric excess.* But big money and decades of pervasive advertising tell us, at every turn, that these sort of passive, stagnant excesses are *totally fine* and calling people out for giving in to them is somehow *shaming* or *yucking their yum*. And of course we as a leisure culture with increasingly little agency just buy into these comforting mantras because just accepting the status quo is easier than the towering problem of finding an escape from it.\n\nSo first off, fucking congratulations on your accomplishment.

Even setting aside the social stigma, which I am sure is real to some extent, the fact that she does not realize (a) how unhealthy she is, (b) what systems/habits are contributing to that, and (c) how it is negatively impacting her psychological and social health as well, is just this big, fat snowballing of issues. I would have dropped a friend like that too, because absent a metanoia and a realization that she needs to get out of that state, she is just going to become a bigger and bigger black hole of stagnancy and negativity. I really hope she gets some help, and maybe the trauma of a broken friendship will be enough to wake her up, but without some self-realization who knows how long it will take before that process even starts.
