There\u2019s some kids sitting next to my feet, I ask him are you with them or??? Why do you need to sit *here* ? He ignored the kid question but then said \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people wanting to sit down here *gestured to the now-full gate area* and it\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re taking up so many seats. Move\u201d I moved my feet toward me a little so 1 more seat was available. He said \u201cNo that\u2019s not enough\u201d \n\nI am still super confused as to why this guy felt the need to wake up a stranger and force them to move. I said no. I was here first, I am trying to rest, not sure why you\u2019re waking me up.

How in the fuck you don\u2019t know normal social etiquette of an airport is outrageous.", "YTA. As the gate area became full, you ***absolutely*** should have moved over to allow others to sit. You were tired, sleep sitting up in a single seat. Your exhaustion doesn't surmount others long days, and just because you were there \"first\" doesn't mean you shouldn't be a decent human being. You also could have moved and found another unpopulated gate area.\n\nETA: I **have** slept in an airport before. I got stuck overnight in Orlando at age 21, and no hotels were available so I had to spend the night. I wound up sleeping in a booth in the food court area with my luggage tucked underneath the table because it was closed. I woke up and realized it was open and daytime and so, though I was still tired, I moved so that I wouldn\u2019t be taking up a whole booth when others would surely need it. I probably moved to a chair somewhere and dozed until family could drive up to get me. Have also slept on the floor with my head on a bag. You make do and try to not be a huge inconvenience and instead be considerate of others. \n\nHow would you feel if you had traveled as long as you had and there were no seats at all available and the place was crowded because someone else had taken over a row of seats to sleep. And would you still not touch someone killing a puppy because it's \"worse\" to touch a stranger? What if the stranger was grabbing you so that you didn't get hit by a car when you're crossing a street?", "YTA but you know that. No one takes up 5 seats when the airport is packed regardless of when you went to sleep and no one was there. That\u2019s not how society works I was here when no one was here so I get 5 seats to sleep in. I also don\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t have armrests, all airports do to stop this very thing.", "YTA\n\nAt the time you laid down? Nope, N T A. You were the only one there.\n\nOnce the terminal filled up, you were now monopolizing a finite resource made available to all passengers; many of which may have been as exhausted as you.  Initially, you weren't the AH. Once you refused to share a common resource when the need was brought to your attention, you became the AH.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't empty anymore.  It was, unfortunately, time to wake up for a bit.  You were taking multiple seats when there weren't enough for everyone who needed one.  You did nothing wrong by falling asleep that way when it was empty, but you really shouldn't be resistant to only taking up one seat once it became crowded.", "YTA\n\nOnce the gate area was getting full, you needed to stop hogging a bunch of space.", "YTA, it doesn't matter it was empty when you laid down.

Just because you were \u201cthere first\u201d that means you get to continue to occupy 4-5 seats once the gate fills up with people waiting for their flight?

There was nobody here when I laid down, and I\u2019m exhausted and didn\u2019t realize the gate had filled up. My apologies.\u201d And then you sit up and occupy only one seat.

No one cares. \n\nBut, if it\u2019s busy, then you don\u2019t take up more than one spot. The chairs are for sitting, not sleeping. Sit your ass up.", "Yta. 1 butt per seat. When it was empty I get it but the gate was full and you were taking up too much real estate. I get you were tired but so are many other people travelling through the airport.", "YTA, why again do you think you are entitled to more than one seat while everyone else is forced to stand or sit on the floor?  This one is sort of unreal buddy, are you that clueless?", "YTA.  It doesn't matter that it was empty when you first took up the seats, it matters that you refused to let others sit down once the area filled up.

What if you were one of the people who was left standing because of someone's boorish behaviour?", "YTA, you may not have been in the wrong when you went to sleep, but you sure as shit were when you woke up and didn't move. Airports and flight gates get full, fast, you should have expected that you'd need to move at some point.\n\nYou are one person and the gate area was full when you were woken, you don't need more than one seat. There is no middle finger big enough for selfish people like you.", "YTA.   Napping across the bench was fair game when it was empty, but when it gets crowded closer to boarding time, not so much.

How can you possibly think it is right for one person to hog 5 seats in a full gate area?

If laying down is a need, lay on the floor. I\u2019ve slept multiple times sitting in a chair or sitting against a wall", "YTA - if you have a 7 hour layover get a hotel room and go sleep there. Taking over a whole row of seats for your own selfishness is ridiculous.", "YTA.  Fine to spread out when no one around, but when people need a place to sit, you need to limit yourself to one seat like everyone else.  To disregard others like this is an AH move.", "I'm sure this is totally fake but just in case yes you are a massive AH for not sitting up.
