Thankfully the chairs here don\u2019t have armrests, so I found an empty gate area and laid down, stretching about 4-5 chairs worth. Fell asleep. I\u2019d been up for like 20 hours and I was exhausted. \n\nAbout an hour I awaken to some stranger tapping me. I say\u2026 can I help you? He said I need to move because he needs to sit there. There\u2019s some kids sitting next to my feet, I ask him are you with them or??? Why do you need to sit *here* ? He ignored the kid question but then said \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people wanting to sit down here *gestured to the now-full gate area* and it\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re taking up so many seats. Move\u201d I moved my feet toward me a little so 1 more seat was available. He said \u201cNo that\u2019s not enough\u201d \n\nI am still super confused as to why this guy felt the need to wake up a stranger and force them to move. I said no. I was here first, I am trying to rest, not sure why you\u2019re waking me up. I tried to accommodate you by moving slightly but you rejected it\u201d and put my eye mask back on and went back to sleep. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not moving? To make it very clear, when I laid down I was the only one in that gate area, didn\u2019t appear to be a flight leaving anytime soon.\n\nEdit: For everyone saying the airports seats always have armrests, here\u2019s where I was: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oqNowQP", "created_utc": 1696031151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vrf12/aita_for_continuing_to_sleep_after_a_stranger/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were tired, sleep sitting up in a single seat. Your exhaustion doesn't surmount others long days, and just because you were there \"first\" doesn't mean you shouldn't be a decent human being. You also could have moved and found another unpopulated gate area.", "YTA but you know that. No one takes up 5 seats when the airport is packed regardless of when you went to sleep and no one was there. That\u2019s not how society works I was here when no one was here so I get 5 seats to sleep in. I also don\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t have armrests, all airports do to stop this very thing.", "YTA\n\nAt the time you laid down? Nope, N T A. You were the only one there.\n\nOnce the terminal filled up, you were now monopolizing a finite resource made available to all passengers; many of which may have been as exhausted as you.  Initially, you weren't the AH. Once you refused to share a common resource when the need was brought to your attention, you became the AH.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't empty anymore.  It was, unfortunately, time to wake up for a bit.  You were taking multiple seats when there weren't enough for everyone who needed one.  You did nothing wrong by falling asleep that way when it was empty, but you really shouldn't be resistant to only taking up one seat once it became crowded.", "YTA\n\nOnce the gate area was getting full, you needed to stop hogging a bunch of space.", "YTA, it doesn't matter it was empty when you laid down. When you realized the area was full you should open up the space. If you wanted to sleep more, find a new empty place.\n\nIt's an airport, you can't expect to be able to take up a bunch of seats wherever you want.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t the asshole when you laid down. It was an empty gate. But you became the asshole when you woke up. \n\nIt clearly wasn\u2019t an empty gate when you woke up. \u201cI was here first\u201d doesn\u2019t apply when you\u2019re using something incorrectly (a seat, which isn\u2019t a bed) and you\u2019re directly impeding someone who\u2019s trying to use it correctly (as a chair for THEIR flight.) \n\nWhat are you confused about here? Just because you were \u201cthere first\u201d that means you get to continue to occupy 4-5 seats once the gate fills up with people waiting for their flight? That\u2019s when you sit up and let people sit down, or move somewhere else. \n\nThe only correct response to this man waking you up is \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry sir. There was nobody here when I laid down, and I\u2019m exhausted and didn\u2019t realize the gate had filled up. My apologies.\u201d And then you sit up and occupy only one seat.

Next time ask a gate agent if they can tell you a quiet corner you won't be in the way while resting.", "YTA. As soon as you saw the full gate area, you needed to get into a single seat. \n\nSame thing applies for people putting bags or other gear into seats: when the place is empty, go ahead; when the place starts filling up, move your stuff.", "YTA - once the area filled up you should have moved", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to take up five seats in a full gate.

Really? \n\nLet me spell it out: a departure gate isn't a bedroom for you to snooze in, and the seats are not your bed. The gate was full, the people rightfully departing from that gate wanted/needed to sit down on the seats you were monopolising, and you're \"super confused\" about that?

No one cares. \n\nBut, if it\u2019s busy, then you don\u2019t take up more than one spot. The chairs are for sitting, not sleeping. Sit your ass up.", "Yta. 1 butt per seat. When it was empty I get it but the gate was full and you were taking up too much real estate. I get you were tired but so are many other people travelling through the airport.", "YTA, why again do you think you are entitled to more than one seat while everyone else is forced to stand or sit on the floor?  This one is sort of unreal buddy, are you that clueless?", "YTA.  It doesn't matter that it was empty when you first took up the seats, it matters that you refused to let others sit down once the area filled up.  How can you not see that you were wrong not to move?  What if you were one of the people who was left standing because of someone's boorish behaviour?", "YTA, you may not have been in the wrong when you went to sleep, but you sure as shit were when you woke up and didn't move. Airports and flight gates get full, fast, you should have expected that you'd need to move at some point.\n\nYou are one person and the gate area was full when you were woken, you don't need more than one seat. There is no middle finger big enough for selfish people like you.", "YTA.   Napping across the bench was fair game when it was empty, but when it gets crowded closer to boarding time, not so much. Luckily, airports are full of sleep-deprived a**holes, so you were in good company. \ud83d\udc4d", "INFO: How many seats on the plane did you attempt to commandeer?", "YTA. How can you possibly think it is right for one person to hog 5 seats in a full gate area? Once you realized that all the other seats were full, you should have apologized and moved immediately.", "YTA- you shouldn\u2019t be taking more space then you need. If laying down is a need, lay on the floor. I\u2019ve slept multiple times sitting in a chair or sitting against a wall", "YTA - if you have a 7 hour layover get a hotel room and go sleep there. Taking over a whole row of seats for your own selfishness is ridiculous.", "YTA.  Fine to spread out when no one around, but when people need a place to sit, you need to limit yourself to one seat like everyone else.  To disregard others like this is an AH move.", "I'm sure this is totally fake but just in case yes you are a massive AH for not sitting up. Who the hell falls asleep in an airport like that, you're lucky you didn't have your stuff stolen. I would have gotten security to get you up or accidentally dropped my hot coffee on you. I guess you think you're very entitled", "Yta. You get one seat. Stop pretending like you\u2019re special", "Of course YTA and I am thrilled you got called out for your nonsense \ud83d\ude44", "Lmao YTA to the EXTREME and it\u2019s wild to me that anyone would be such an AH that they\u2019d even ask. \n\nAirport / gate empty = Take up all the space you want. \n\nGate packed w/people waiting to board = you better fucking take up 1 person\u2019s worth of seats or spread out somewhere on the floor. Those people have a fucking flight to board.", "YTa", "._.", "YTA. Your lack of self-awareness is stunning. The gate may have been empty when you fell asleep, but it was full when he woke you. People wanted to sit down. Why you thought you were entitled to multiple seats is just weird. The fact that you had been up for 20 hours is your problem. Other people probably were tired as well.", "YTA. If it\u2019s full you shouldn\u2019t be taking up 5 seats for yourself.", "Obviously YTA. You\u2019re entitled rude and disrespectful as well. You don\u2019t get to take up a whole ass aisle because you\u2019re tired. You are not the main character of the airport, you\u2019re probably not even the main character of your own life you\u2019re just some person who\u2019d give common loot in an rpg", "YTA as most people have said. I'll admit I passed out laying over two seats before in a terminal gate area after taking a ton of meds lol. People were even sleeping on the floor so I don't personally think you were an asshole for just falling asleep. But once you saw that the gate was full you needed to give your seat up. Sleep on the floor of you gotta.", "YTA-  when there are people waiting for seats, you don't take more than one or two.  One if possible.", "YTA alright. Geez", "Of course YTA. You were taking up 4-5 seats. You\u2019re one person - you get one seat. The entitlement\u2026", "YTA and a perfect example of entitlement.  You can have one seat in a public space not five. WTH is wrong with you.", "You are not necessarily TA.   \n\n\nIt depends on who wanted to sit down. Was their need to sit greater than your need to sleep?  \n\n\nIf it were an elderly person with 2 knee replacements, arthritis, and a cane I would say YTA. \n\nIf it was a mom who had recently given birth to a newborn, I would say YTA.\n\n  \nIf it was a squad of high school cheerleaders, who recently arrived at the airport, I would say NTA, they can go stand someplace, or sit on the floor, and have some curtesy and let you sleep.   \n\n\nI've sat on the floor at the airport, it's no big deal if you are able-bodied to do this.   \n\n\nNow the trouble is you don't know if someone has a hidden disability. Chemo treatments? A medical device? Seizures? Chronic pain? So you have no idea if your needs supersede theirs. Due to this confounding factor, if I were you, I would have tried to lay on the floor behind some seats someplace with little foot traffic.   \n\n\nI have laid on the floor at the airport, and used my carry on bag as a pillow.
