This involves me (27M), my best friend Houston (27) and his girlfriend of the past 8 months Kelsey (28). Me and Houston are best friends and have been since 4th grade, practically brothers at this point. I own my house and Houston lives with me so I have known kelsey since they\u2019ve started dating. I like her, she\u2019s a little pushy for me but seems to make my buddy happy so I give an effort. \n\nI am single and have been for years. I\u2019m very independent and don\u2019t like to get tied down so I tend to do my own thing and not answer to anyone. So about 3 weeks ago Kelsey started bringing up a party her friend was throwing and said she would like me to go as there were games and all her friends would be there so I could get to know them. I said maybe, and she said she really hoped I could make it. Over the next few weeks she would bring it up to me whenever I saw her and even texted me the details 2 times the week of. I kept telling her maybe, as I enjoy my Saturday nights and her friends sounded boring. Most are either single moms, married, divorced or just not my type. \n\nSo I didn\u2019t go and during the night of the party both Houston and Kelsey called me multiple times asking if I was coming. I said that I always said maybe, and instead I was going golfing and then out to a bar. So I got home around 1am and Houston and Kelsey were up. I said hello and went to the kitchen and that\u2019s when everything started. Kelsey went in on me. Saying how rude it was as she told her friends about me coming. And they were playing games and counted on me being there. I said they shouldn\u2019t have done that as I was a firm maybe. Kelsey called me a selfish douchebag who can\u2019t sacrifice for my friend and only does what I want. I said it sounded like you have the problem here Kelsey not Houston. Houston said for everyone to cool it. But Kelsey kept going, until I finally snapped. I said \u201cI just don\u2019t give a fuck about making you happy. It\u2019s not my job. I\u2019m not sleeping with you. I\u2019m not wasting my Saturday night with your boring, fat or married friends. I got no interest in any of that. Sorry, but get over it.\u201d Houston and me went at it for the first time ever. We never fight but he said Kelsey was trying to bring me into her group and maybe find someone. I said I\u2019m not interested in any of her friends, or wasting my weekends pretending that I want to be there. So he can do whatever he wants but to not include me in it. And the only reason she wants to set me up is because she is worried that I\u2019ll be a hurdle in your relationship. Other things were said but that was the jist of it. \n\nWe didn\u2019t speak at all yesterday. And I have no plans on apologizing.

INFO... When you said \"maybe\", did you have any intention of going?", "You were way too rude, don't pretend you like her when you clearly don't, and why can't you just say \"No\" like an adult? Maybe does not mean no.", "Edit: YTA\n\nInfo: Why didn't you just say NO? What's with the maybe, maybe, maybe... Even when they called you at the night of the party you said maybe when it seems your mind was pretty made up on not going.\n\nThis feels very much like a E S H just the way you have described it.", "First of all, pretty sure you posted this last week, but anyway, YTA. If you get an invite, the appropriate responses are yes or no. A maybe is a rude response, especially that soon to the party. Letting the host know if you will or won\u2019t be there helps them plan accordingly. It sounds like you never intended to go, so you should\u2019ve just said so.\n\nAlso, her friends did nothing to you, but they way you talk about women implies they are only worthy of hanging out with if they meet your specific sexual attraction criteria", "YTA. You weren't a \"firm maybe\", you were a firm \"no\" but didn't have the honesty to just tell them", "YTA, and you're not \"independent\" or some \"lone wolf\" like you seem to think, LOL. You're just an AH.\n\nNeed clarification? \n\n>I\u2019m very independent and don\u2019t like to get tied down so I tend to do my own thing and not answer to anyone. \n\nYeah, the fact that you're an AH because abundantly clear right about here, where you basically announced that you see being in an adult relationship as \"being tied down\" and having to \"answer to someone\". That's . . . not how that works. But fine, you're entitled not to want to date, NBD. What you AREN'T entitled to is being unbelievably rude, and assuming that the whole world revolves around you.\n\nYour friend's girlfriend invited you to a get-together that you very clearly, from the outset, had no interest in and didn't want to go to. Did you use your big boy words and say, \"Thanks for the invite, but I have other plans\" or \"thanks for inviting me but I'm not really a Games Night kind of person\"? Nope. Instead you said \"maybe\". . .\n\n> I kept telling her maybe, as I enjoy my Saturday nights and her friends sounded boring. Most are either single moms, married, divorced or just not my type.\n\nSo much yikes. Into yourself much? Like, I don't even know how to address a nearly 30-year-old man who sounds like a 13-year-old Andrew Tate fan. But let's talk about the fact that she said you could GET TO KNOW her friends, not that she was offering them to you like a buffet. You're her boyfriend's bestie. Do you understand what \"get to know\" means? She was suggesting that the bunch of you hang out . . . like friends do? I'm pretty sure you couldn't come across as any more slimy or misogynistic if you tried.\n\n>\r  \nSo I didn\u2019t go and during the night of the party both Houston and Kelsey called me multiple times asking if I was coming. I said that I always said maybe, and instead I was going golfing and then out to a bar\n\nSo you knew the entire time that you had no intention of showing up, but instead of being even REMOTELY polite and saying so, you kept letting them think right up until the party was actually happening that you might show up, even though you literally had other plans. \n\nOf course YTA. You were rude not just to Kelsey but to Houston, whom you claim is your boy, your oldest and best friend. You treat people like shit and think it's some kind of impressive character trait. It isn't. Have fun being friendless at 40.", "Yta not because you decided not to go but because here it sounded like you had already made a decision long before that you weren't going to go. Why say maybe so much when you had no intention of going anyways...there is no definitive maybe....that's more just stringing people along as they wait for a final decision.", "Huge YTA. You lack basic manners.", "You just know this guy has a gamer tag like Alphawolf or RoninWarrior. \n\nShe was being a bit too aggressive in the invite, but you don't look good at all here. Why are you fat-shaming her friends? They have literally done nothing to you.\n\nYTA", "wasn't a very similar story posted like last week in here!?", "YTA, you should have said \u201cno,\u201d or been more up front that you had other plans for the night- this was an avoidable argument. Also, there\u2019s no need to call people who\u2019ve done nothing to you fat and boring, it\u2019s an AH move.", "I guess ESH, because you shouldn\u2019t be pushed to go to a party if you don\u2019t want to go.  You also should have communicated better and told them that you might have plans.  But you certainly have no obligation to go.\n\nThere was no need to insult Kelsey\u2019s friends, they\u2019ve done nothing to you.  Your attitude is kind of shitty here, like you think there\u2019s no point in hanging out with them if there\u2019s not a woman there that you might want to fuck.  Maybe they\u2019re fun people?  Maybe you might have made a friend with one of those \u201cfat, boring, married\u201d women?", "YTA. You didn't give her a definite no, you kept saying maybe. YTA for your attitude towards not only her but also her friends. YTA for insulting her friends.", "YTA. You really think you're a big boy when you can't even say no? Independent my ass. Independent people know how to say no.", "ESH. 'A firm maybe' lmao. Don't tell someone maybe when you know the answer is no, it's a dick move. I get the distinct impression that most of your moves are dick moves.", "ESH except Houston. Kelsey for being pushy and assuming that your *maybe* was a yes, and you for being so rude and judgmental about her friends who you don\u2019t even know. Who are you to decide that someone isn\u2019t worth getting to know because they\u2019re \u201cfat or married\u201d \u2014 yikes. It\u2019s fine for you to want your own space and it was fine for you to not want to go to the party, you were obviously within your rights, but your attitude *sucks.*", "ESH\n\nYou may not the TAH in this situation, but you're clearly AN AH.", "ESH - Kelsey was being too pushy, that's for sure. Pushing you to, I assume, meet someone to start dating is an asshole move in general. She should not have told her friends you were coming if there was no definite yes.\n\nThat being said, you are the bigger asshole for how you handled it. You said maybe, knowing full well you were likely not going to go. You knew what she was pushing for and you did not say otherwise to her. You did not correct her, you did not say \"I'm not interested in going to this party, and especially not to meet anybody\", you did not explain in a polite way why you didn't want to go. You intentionally led her on (yes, you didn't say yes, but you made it damn clear there was a chance you would go) but even beyond all that, your response to her was extremely rude and off-putting.\n\nYou can snap at her for being pushy, that's fine. But you took it WAY too far by insulting her and her friends. Her friends did absolutely nothing to you. You were also not being honest when it's very clear you understood her motivations and neglected to correct her. That makes you an asshole too. \n\nShe was pushy, but you took it way too far.", "YTA \n\nGrow up. You\u2019re almost 30.", "NTA for not going and not wanting a relationship. YTA for your characterizations of Kelsey's friends. That was very jerky.", "Esh. You can set a boundary without being a bigot about it.\n\n\"I didn't want to go, i never agreed to go, back off or get out of my house\"", "ESH. You said maybe when you meant no and those comments about her friends weren't called for. Kelsey shouldn't have taken a maybe as a yes and told people that you were going to be there when it wasn't clear. I also think it's weird that she pushed so hard for you to attend that party just so she could play matchmaker. That sort of behaviour always creeps me out. Houston seems fine in all this and you seem like an AH generally. I'm interested in knowing what happened the day of though because apparently they called you multiple times. Were you still saying maybe, or did you let them know that you had plans to golf and drink? I initially read it as you telling them that you had plans, but then I saw the bit about them ringing multiple times, so that doesn't sound right.", "You sound like HARD WORK! \n\nYTA", "YTA. You didn't have to insult Kelsey's friends like that. Also it's not like you were invited to the party at gunpoint, you could have said No", "YTA lol you can choose whether you go to a party or not but what you said about her friends is way out of line", "Yta\n\nDude, you were rude for keep on insisting on \"maybe\" when you knew it was a no. But calling her friends names was totally uncalled for.", "Yeah YTA dude, you sound miserable to be around and unable to interact with other people. You can't make friends with fat women? Honestly kind of gross that if you don't think you'll want to fuck someone there you think it's a waste of time. REGARDLESS, in this specific situation you're also TA. If you didn't want to go just say no, there's no reason to shit on Kelsey's friends, who are also friends with your best bro! Like damn dude read an etiquette book.", "Nta. No maybes in future. Just no thanks.", "Lol I know I'll get down voted by the Reddit \"hive mind\" but NTA. He didn't commit to the party,  tried being polite and ultimately was pushed to the point of making some comments that *hurt Kelsey's feelings*....which Kelsey is responsible for. \n\nThis wasn't an RSVP situation and OP is obviously not interested in Kelsey's matchmaking schemes. People give 'maybes' for informal gatherings all of the time.  \n\nOnce again,  if this was a woman making the post, Reddit would be all over the guy trying to manipulate someone who has no interest and no skin in the game. \n\nETA: OP, maybe consider talking to Houston and explain EXPLICITLY that you are not interested in being fixed up with ANYONE. It's sad to see a 20 yr friendship crash and burn because his gf is pushy.", "NTA it's great she wanted to include you. It was okay that you said maybe. But her pushing the party on you was rude. If she needed a headcount for some reason she could have said so. Sure the third time you said maybe should have sparked a real conversation about how willing you were about going. No explanation needed cuz she doesn't own you. But her being that pushy would have turned me off from going even if I was just gonna pay lip service to my best buds new chick.\n\nThe blow up after was her fault. 1am is not the time to confront anybody but a cheating spouse. Like girl he ain't yours and he doesn't want none of you or your friends, get over it.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to learn their place. I got out of a relationship in March and I dont plan on being in a relationship anytime soon (or ever again, we shall see), but everyone always says \"maybe if you go to... you can meet someone\" .. Annoys the fuck out of me when people assume what i want, that i want to date again and meet people.\n\nIm with you on this one", "ESH, you for not telling her no up front when you knew you had no intention of going.  You should've have just said no thank you.  But would that answer have satisfied her?  Would she have kept pushing you to say yes?  Probably.  She's the AH for telling her friends that you were coming when you never said you were.  And she's the AH for calling you names.  And YTA again for your reply to her.", "NTA at all.  She wants you to hook up with one  of her single friends for whatever  reason. Maybe she's worried that if you date a  \"stranger\", and it gets serious, that Houston will be asked to move out.   Do you feel that Kelsey is wanting to move into  your house?", "NTA. Kelsey is clearly on a mission to tie OP down. OP is absolutely right she is threatened that her bf has a single friend/roommate. She doesn't want him around a single guy so is trying to force a relationship on him to make him acceptable.  To those saying he is rude to say Maybe, they would have went at him even more if he just sd no. Agreed there is mild rudeness here but it's perfectly acceptable and reasonable response to some bossy acquaintance trying to force obviously unwanted social activities down his throat. If they don't like it they can GTFO. If he was at all polite she wld have taken it as encouragement.", "NTA\n\nMaybe means maybe. If I extend an invitation to someone and they don't confirm and then continue to not confirm, I don't plan on them. If they show, then fine, I invited them and am glad they showed. But my invite is never an expectation of attendance. It is just an invite.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wouldn\u2019t want to be constantly pushed into attending a party I didn\u2019t want to go to either, but the judgmental comments about Kelsey\u2019s friends were unnecessary and below the belt.

Because he has zero interest in meeting and getting to know people he isn't planning to fuck. Which is such a total turn off. No wonder he can't find a girlfriend.", "> He didn't commit to the party\n\nMy issue is that he said maybe when he really meant \"no, unless I have nothing else to do.\" Maybe implies he would want to go but isn't sure if he's available yet. If he didn't actually want to go, he should have said that. It sounds like he made plans AFTER saying maybe and then told his best friend and gf \"nah, I'm not coming\" after the party had started. \n\nIf he's not interested, that is totally fine. If he had said no and the gf persisted, I would agree he's not the asshole. But saying maybe over and over and only saying he wasn't coming afterward and then getting pissy that they didn't read his mind IS an asshole move.\n\nThat, and calling her friends \"boring\" and \"fat\". Like, Jesus, there was no need to snap like that about her friends, who did absolutely nothing to him. Be annoyed at the gf who was too pushy, fine. But insulting her friends was an asshole thing.\n\nLike, he could have avoided the big blow-up by saying no at the start when he KNEW he wasn't likely to go.", "You are absolutely right everyone would be on his side if this was the opposite.

And you were really rude about her friends. Unnecessarily so. YTA", "Kelsey and Houston should have let this go. But YTA for one, not giving a firm response and saying \u201cno\u201d from the get-go, instead of waiting for a better offer. Two, for your reasons for not going. And three, for your characterization of her friends. You sound very shallow. There was no reason to insult her friends.\n\nYour \u201cfirm maybe\u201d is flaky. I was tempted to say E S H because they shouldn\u2019t have hounded you about the party or tried to get involved in your love life, but at the end of the day you knew you didn\u2019t want to go, you made assumptions about her friends, and could have just said that you were doing your own thing when you received the invitation. \n\nYou sound immature- if you don\u2019t want to be tied down that\u2019s fine. But to put this in another perspective- you receive an invitation from your best friend\u2019s SO to meet some new people important to her, and possibly important to him. It\u2019s a party, not a blind date. Why not go, hang out for a bit, and then leave if you\u2019re bored?

By his description he was a soft maybe. So I feel he didn\u2019t communicate his maybe proper", "Yeah the more I think about it the more Kelsey seems to not be the A. She reacted how anyone would, its just that if someone doesn't show up 1/3rd of the way through the party I just assume they are a no show. \n\nAdditionally I think she thought OP was a much better person than what he has revealed himself to be otherwise she wouldn't have tried so hard to have him meet her friends especially seeing how lowly he thinks of them.", " Eh I read firm maybe as \"don't get your hopes up\", which is what the housemate and the housemates GF did."]}
