Their logic is really ignorant and uninformed. Hand holding is great if the alternative is mental exhaustion, a nervous breakdown or a panic attack.

Ask your half-sister what she thinks.   You sound like the only person who is looking out for her.   You are helping her self-regulate.  People don't outgrow autism.

I think your doing great. Tell your mom & stepdad that you are doing what best for half-sister\u2019s anxiety & giving her some support when needed. If they don\u2019t get it, too bad.

You are helping her, while they are letting her drown in the pool because she can't swim.", "NTA. You already said she\u2019s growing out of it. As her parents, they should have done tons of research on autism. I have co workers that are autistic, all engineers, but I worked with autistic teens before my current job years ago, and I can not tell you how many times an autistic kid had a episode at a restaurant and cops were called and the teen was arrested. Your parents are absolutely wrong. The fact alone that she found what works for her is amazing.

I am so very glad that you and your sister have each other.  \n\nI wonder if there is a keychain or piece of jewelry or something.

Imagine she is holding your hand.  Now I'm not saying this as there's anything wrong with holding your hand but there's going to be times you guys are apart and she's going to face anxiety. \n\nYour mother and stepfather are very much the a-holes here.   \n\nLook at it like this- everyone uses coping strategies.  Everyone.  If someone is doing something to relax then yeah it's still a coping strategy.\nI'm sure if you look at the behaviors of your mother and stepfather you will see tons of coping strategies they do. \n\nIt feels discriminatory that your mother said about your sister.  Just because your sister is autistic, she's not allowed to use them as well?  \n\nDid you ever see an adult doodle on a piece of paper during the phone call? Biting their lip.  Tapping their foot?  These are all self-soothing techniques.  Irish worry stones.  Chewing on the end of a pen.  \nHeck singing to themselves is a method of self soothing.\n\nThey need to get over themselves. This is not about them.", "I'm an autistic adult. No matter how \"high functioning\" or \"low needs\" we may be, autistic people will always still have some special needs. We DON'T age out of being autistic. It's not \"enabling\" to accommodate an autistic person when they have sensory issues. I'm in my 30's and I STILL have some sensory issues. This is 100% normal for anyone on the autism spectrum and if your parents knew anything about it they would fucking know that.   \n\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. Your parents need to drop their misguided opinions and actually read a fucking book on the condition for once because it's obvious they haven't.", "NTA. What is wrong with comforting a loved one in times of high anxiety or stress?", "Nta", "People can change the levels of anxiety they experience though, and it sounds like op is actively helping with that, given that sister is improving rather than getting more anxious and dependant.", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "That\u2019s what I thought too! Like you enable behaviors, not emotions!! Someone who\u2019s coping with anxiety by holding a trusted family members hand isn\u2019t being enabled, they\u2019re coping with anxiety!! That\u2019s completely different from enabling a behavior (like someone spending all their money and then demanding more).\n\nIt\u2019s like not even comparable!  What, do they just want OP\u2019s sister to be lost in anxiety because her one hood coping mechanism got taken from her? Like holding OP\u2019s hand is way better than struggling to deal with crowds at all!!!"]}
