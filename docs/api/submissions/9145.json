My husband is Italian and I am Brazilian, but we communicate in English as it is our common language. I always wanted my daughter to get to know my culture from an early age, so I invested in Portuguese classes so that one day she could travel to my country. However, during classes I noticed that she was great with languages \u200b\u200band learned very quickly. That's why I learned more languages \u200b\u200bwith her. Currently she understands English, Portuguese, Spanish and a little Italian. \n\nRecently, my husband said that I should invest in another hobby with our daughter, as studying languages \u200b\u200bis not very common and he felt left out. He also said he wished we only spoke English at home as he didn't understand the other languages \u200b\u200band again said he felt left out. When I asked what he wanted us to do with him, he suggested trips (only countries he liked), games and family time. I replied that if he wanted to spend more time with her he should show interest in her hobby even if it wasn't that common instead of just being jealous. \n\nAfter that night he hasn't spoken to me properly and said he expects an apology from me. I'm not sure if I was the asshole, as what he suggested was to force our daughter to do things he enjoyed instead of joining us in our hobby of learning other languages. My daughter is not a math or science genius but she is very smart when it comes to learning and I want to invest in that trait in her as it will be good for her future. So AITA?\n\nUpdate: Reading some comments I suggested to my husband that he should teach our daughter something. Today when I got home from work I came across them in the kitchen preparing dinner. There were a lot of dirty pans, but they seemed to be enjoying themselves. I was even greeted with cake. They finally found something they like in common and are enjoying doing it together! I apologized to him for the way I expressed myself and now we're on speaking terms again, thanks for the help!

It's understandable that you want to invest in your daughter's talents and interests, especially if they bring her joy and could benefit her in the future. It's also important to respect your husband's feelings, but it doesn't sound like he is willing to join in and support your daughter's interests. Instead, he is trying to make her conform to his interests, which is not fair to her or to you. You are not the one being unreasonable here.", "Hello! I definitely feel that you have a fair point, but I do think that the wording could have been a lot better. You are definitely allowed to bond with your daughter however you like, that includes languages. However, I do think that that could be maybe something that only you and your daughter share. I think it would be a great idea to have your husband and daughter bond over something similar that they like on their own! But you should not have to stop learning languages with your daughter just because your husband doesn\u2019t want to learn. If your husband doesn\u2019t want to learn, then that\u2019s kind of on him. (Maybe you could watch shows in other languages as well and he could slowly begin picking it up so it doesn\u2019t feel like learning?).

My father is an Italian man who is exactly like this: he never once took an interest in my interests as a child and forced me to go along with his things I never enjoyed. He never taught me Italian, just expected my non-Italian mother to teach it to me. He never took any initiative into actually building a relationship with me and he fostered all the effort of parenting onto my mother, then got angry at us both for having the closer relationship. He was an intensely selfish parent, and it sounds to me like your husband is doing the exact same thing. Let me tell you, I do not speak to my father anymore.

He was asking for more family time and more travel and you immediately shut him down. I suspect this is about you not wanting to do things YOU don't like.

I grew up in a multilingual home, but I never learned to speak my dad\u2019s language. My mom and I will often communicate in a language (that he doesn\u2019t speak) at home, and I simply switch to English when I talk to my dad. My dad is completely okay with us speaking a different language, because he knows that he never took the time to teach me his language while my mom did. It is NOT your fault that he feels left out, it\u2019s his fault for not teaching her Italian so he could also share his culture with her. \n\nI\u2019m also a bit unsure about comments regarding rudeness. Yes it\u2019s rude when you\u2019re out with friends and you speak a language someone can\u2019t understand. Inside your own home?

Having a conversation about it isn't switching the burden off of him onto her, it's two parents having a conversation about one of them and their interactions with their child. It's about finding a solution where their child forms a bond with their father. Why on earth are people making some weird twisted leap that this would be some concession of responsibility?\n\nFor the record, it seems like he **WAS** trying to do something constructive, by talking about it with his wife/co-parent, and OP shut that down immediately.\n\n>but he wants her to do what he likes and that's it.\n\nOP said.\n\n>I replied that if he wanted to spend more time with her he should show interest in her hobby even if it wasn't that common instead of just being jealous.\n\nI'm not out here arguing this guy is father of the year. I am simply saying that the thing they bond over doesn't have to be something she already enjoys. Yes he should take an interest, but he should also not be limited entirely by what he wants to explore as a way of connecting. **NONE** of which makes him \"jealous\". Inattentive father, sure, jealous? Not in the slightest.\n\nShutting down **ANY** effort on his part without further engagement isn't healthy, it isn't productive and it isn't going to result in anyone being happier. \n\nHe isn't able to engage on some things, that happens. I'm neurodivergent, there's somethings I just cannot engage with and never will be able to. The answer to that isn't to say \"only to these things\", it's to open up the scope of it and find common ground, and to not be reductive by assigning a motive like jealousy.\n\nI really don't think what I am saying is controversial. He feels left out, he wants to spend more time with his daughter, OP should be fine with that, it's a good thing. What the hell is the downside to having a conversation about how that would best be achieved rather than calling him jealous and not giving him the chance to do the same thing she has done with the languages.\n\n>Portuguese was a personal endeavor and turns out the little one loves languages so she wanted to learn more\n\nYes...

You've now stated I said both, which cannot possibly be true, and me responding to two different statements with two completely different realities is absurd, so please just pick one.\n\nIf you wish to take umbridge with me addressing her directly as she's the one asking AITA, then that's one thing, and fine, whatever. Language can be interpreted differently. But I repeat my previous statement.\n\n>I don't believe I said it was...\n\nConfirmed by you completely changing what you said in your reply.

What I wrote was fine and I stand by what I wrote. You presented two completely different statements and represented them as mine, both of which cannot be true.

If anything he should at least be the one to help her with Italian, but you mention he doesn\u2019t even want to do that. So everyone must cater to him and do what he likes? \n\nOr is he willing to ask daughter if there\u2019s something she\u2019s interested in that he likes?", "At first I was like no, you are NTA. But after reading all the comments of everyone here. It is a 50/50 for me. YTA as well. Because of the simple fact that you shouldnt say your husband is jealous. He legit said multiple times that he feels left out. This should make you realize he loves you both and really wants to be included but cant seem to find an opening, so he reached out multiple times, for help by you whom should be his partner, and should help him with it. Instead of bashing him and calling him jealous.\n\nAnd I agree with everyone else who says your daughter should learn to try other people their hobbies too. She might find a new hobby she does like, and, she should learn it isnt only about her. \n\nLater when she has amazing close friends, they wont only do what she likes. Please dont set her up to be a spoiled diva who thinks the world evolves around her. Because we got enough of those people already.", "NTA", "Is there a sport you can do together?  Bowling, golf, rock climbing, yoga, dance?   You all may need to get out of your comfort zones.", "YTA\n\nHe said he wanted to travel, play games, and have family time\u2026and this was somehow unacceptable? And then you add that little (only countries he liked), what does that even mean? You\u2019re expecting him to suggest a country he doesn\u2019t like to go to for a family trip? I\u2019m failing to see how this makes any sense and why it\u2019s so weird to you that he would suggest these things. It seems to me almost like you want to use your bond with the child as a weapon against your husband to show how \u201cnot enough\u201d he is. Well, it would be hard to hold bonding with the child over his head if he actually got to bond with her, wouldn\u2019t it? You seriously need to back the hell off and let the child and him find some common ground, which you are currently hindering.", "My partner is not a native of my country and arrived speaking their language, mine, and three others fluently while signing in 3 more. Our kids are being raised bilingual. I am doing Duolingo daily to slowly learn more but admit that I am slow. I do not have my partner's gift.\nIt is each partner's job to learn their partner's tongue. That is a baseline requirement for multicultural relationships. It is great that your daughter shares the interest.\nYou are NTA.", ">If he wants to bond with his daughter he needs to learn to do the things that she likes, not the other way around.\n\nExactly this.  That's being a good parent.\n\nWanting her to revolve around his likes and dislikes is him being a narcissist.  He needs to work on that.", "bingo.", "Are you for real rn lmfao??? Why should they do activities that solely he likes? What's the point of spending time together then? If you're going to be spending time as a family, you should do things that everyone enjoys.", "Portuguese and Spanish have SO much overlap most Portuguese speakers can pick up Spanish without trying. As a Portuguese, Spanish, and French (now learning Italian) speaker, your comparison is way off.", "Came here to say this. My partner has struggled to teach his native language to our kids so they know mine much better. But mine are also so close, his doesn\u2019t even slightly overlap English. \n\nPortuguese and Spanish are closer than Portuguese and Italian by a lot. \n\nAlso? OP doesn\u2019t need to facilitate Dads relationship to daughter. He\u2019s an entire adult who will reap what he is sowing. \n\nIt hurts to watch. It hurts to watch a partner not live up to their responsibilities.  We want to admire our partners and see our co-parents invest in the kids.  But we can\u2019t MAKE them be admirable in these ways and we can\u2019t MAKE them turn around their lack of investment in the kids.\n\nHe knows he\u2019s not connecting. He wants OP to fix it. Or to blame OP. That\u2019s not going to fly.", "No actually, it isnt him who should teach her. You said he doesnt like to do that (learning languages) maybe he also isnt good at it. And you said it is your mutual interest with your daughter. Why in the world would it be his task then? Seems petty. YTA.", "Op is a man ftr but I agree", "> Yes... Almost as if trying new things and forming a bond together over a mutual interest is the overall goal here...\n\n\nThat's precisely the point you're missing. Dad doesn't want to try new things, he wants her to bond with him over his interests period. Nothing is stopping him from start something new with their daughter but that's not what he wants and she made clear his interests are not her thing. If all he keeps doing is complaining things don't go his way of course OP would eventually shut him down telling him to deal with it - he doesn't want a solution or compromise, he wants his way and gets moody when their daughter isn't his mini me.", "Game, trips, and family time are all great family bonding activities. Why would you actively discourage such suggestions? They seem reasonable to me. Forcing your husband to learn no languages as a hobby in order to spend time with his daughter is selfish on your part. Can\u2019t there be a compromise? Clearly to me, YTA", "NTA. I wanted to spend more time with my kid\u2026 guess what\u2026\u2026 now I like anime!!! Took a while, but I got to love it.

If so you guys could schedule short family hikes when it gets warmer out she may develop it into a hobby it's also good to be physically active, and could bridge part of the gap. I was a huge outdoorsy kid my older brother was not but I have very fond memories related to a trail that has caves and such that my whole family used to bond over even though we all had varying interests or swimming another one for warmer weather. You should encourage her to also go through with atleast trying some of his hobbies if you haven't she may unexpectedly find a few she likes. Dancing they could do justkids dance type thing they used to have a ton of videos for them on YouTube so it can be a homebody activity and it plays into her being into the arts as dance is certainly an art, and he could exchange it by taking an interest in one of the things that she likes. Maybe traveling once in awhile wouldn't be terrible bend on a country that one of the languages she knows is common in but also is similar to one of the ones he likes and go there in the summer or for a break gives her a chance to bond with him aswell as use a language she knows when ordering at a restaurant or something.", "Because it sounds like the husband knows Italian as a first language and OP doesn\u2019t?
