Its annoying having no help but I deal with it since I stopped working to do so. The thing is, my husband's a total slob. He'll make all sorts of messes and then will complain about them. That's not the problem though. The problem is, he always blames all the messes on me and gets mad if I ever forget anything.\n\n\nFor example, I'll have my hands full trying to clean cook and take care of the kids at the same time. I'll forget to throw away, say, the jar of spaghetti sauce or whatever, just one item. Or I'll accidentally forget to put one item in the sink. And he'll just throw an absolute fit about it even though everythings cleaned by the end of the night. Well lately we've had problems with fruit flies (usually bad around this time of the year so you have to be super careful about stuff being left out). Every time he sees something he'll start complaining about me causing us to have fruit flies. I tried to tell him that most of the stuff was his anyways and he just kept saying he never leaves mess out that it was all mine.\n\nWell I decided to make a point and specifically ONLY cleaned up mine and the kids mess. We ended up having basically nothing to eat off or with, me and the kids just used plastic silverware and paper plates, and his gaming room ended up infested with the flies and started to smell like hell. He ended up having to throw away his favorite bowls because they got infested with maggots. I thought that would prove the point that he's the problem with the mess and get him off my back, but now he's mad I cleaned up everything else and purposely left his stuff saying it's my fault his stuff was ruined and his gaming room is gross now and that even if he makes a mess its my job to clean up (which I disagree with, I do it because I have to but it's not like I wanted to have to stay home and take care of everything alone and I'm busy with school too). Anyways it started a huge fight, I complained to my family but they said it's my job as the housewife to take care of that and there was no excuse for doing that just to make a point and he shouldn't have to worry about cleaning up anyways.
