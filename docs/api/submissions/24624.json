I love her and truly want to spend my life with her, provided that this wedding doesn't tear us apart.\n\nI am not religious, never have been. Lily is Catholic. We discussed religion before we ever became a couple. She told me she was Catholic, I told her I was not, and had no interest in converting. She said that was fine, as long as I was respectful toward her beliefs. So far, I have been. I keep quiet about my views on organized religion, I bow my head when her family says grace, I even tolerate her religious Christmas music without a complaint.\n\nWhen we started planning our wedding, Lily gave me a list of demands I would have to meet in order to marry her. I would have to meet with the bishop and promise not to pull her away from Catholicism. I would have to marry her in a church. I would have to participate in the Catholic wedding ceremony.\n\nLily insists that it isn't a big deal. The meeting with the bishop should only take 20 minutes, and the wedding should only take 45 minutes tops, so what's the big deal? The big deal is that Lily promised she wouldn't involve me in her religion. I told her I had no interest in stepping foot in a church ever. Now it seems like she's going back on her word.\n\nShe called me an AH because I flat-out refused to go through with it, even when she offered to do a secular ceremony in addition, or even as the main event.

Beliefs, both yours and hers, are a massive part of identity. She's Catholic, it's hardly surprising she's hoping for a Catholic wedding.  The list she's presented you with sounds like the sort of list the Catholic Church produce to agree to marry a Catholic to a non-Catholic,the list being extensive and detailed is not necessarily on her. However, what about when you have kids? Getting them christened? Is that her putting her religion on you, or her sharing her beliefs with her child and community? There's actually a lot for you both to talk about.", "NAH, but you don\u2019t sound compatible. And what happens if you have children? She will probably want to raise them in the church.", "No asshole assignment here\n\nIt seems as if there was a fundamental misunderstanding due to lack of communication.  The ability to solve this without getting overly emotional is the first test of your would be nuptials.\n\nWork it out with your soon to be wife, dude", "NAH, just 2 incompatible people.  \n\nForget the wedding.  What happens with kids? Are you OK leaving your children alone with a catholic priest? Is she ok with you telling yoir kids you don't believe in God and won't attend church? \n\nOf course, if you both don't want kids, it could be fine. But, if you do want kids, consider how she changed her requirements for the wedding and ask yourself what happens if she decides you have to start attending church and pretending to believe \"for the kids.\" \n\nDo not get married until you have worked this out.  You will regret it.", "You don't sound compatible. If you have children, she'll want to raise them Catholic. There's a baptism, first holy communion, etc. And, most Catholic dioceses require pre-marital counseling. Look it up. It often is a 6-month course. If you aren't up for all of this, it's best to find someone you're compatible with.", "NAH. It seems like you both are incompatible as husband and wife. Seems like her religion needs a lot for this marriage to happen, which you are welcome to not do but she wishes to have. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. What happens if you have kids? Will your fiancee want to attend family events at church together with you? These are things that should be thought through.", "NTA. It\u2019s not fair for her to tell you she won\u2019t involve you in her religion and then demand you get married in the church. \n\nI\u2019m also going to echo what everyone else here is saying - this relationship is a dead end. I\u2019m not sure how much you know about Catholicism, but I can tell you as an ex-Catholic that you are not going to enjoy being married to one. It\u2019s a very rigid, intense sect of Christianity. If she\u2019s as devout as you\u2019re describing, I don\u2019t really believe she\u2019s going to leave you alone and not try to convert you somewhere down the line. \n\nI do believe that you love each other - but love isn\u2019t enough. You have to be fundamentally compatible. You two aren\u2019t.", "NTA. Not having grown up Catholic yourself, you probably wouldn't have known this, but the Catholic religion typically doesn't recognize a marriage unless it took place in the Catholic church. The couple is often required to attend pre-cana, you are asked to agree that any children born from the marriage will be baptized into the Catholic faith, and some churches still insist on a non-Catholic partner converting before they will marry you in the church. Your fianc\u00e9e should have told you about all of this long before you two ever got to the point of engagement. She wants you to be respectful of her beliefs but isn't being respectful of your non-belief. Nonetheless, if you love this woman, silly as you think it is, she may genuinely feel as if she is living in mortal sin by not having her marriage recognized as a sacrament before god, condeming herself to hell upon her death. That's a compromise she is unlikely to make if she takes her faith that seriously. Is this the hill you're willing to allow your relationship to die on?", "Basically NTA because you don't want to go through a ritual you don't identify with.\n\nForget the wedding, it's the rest of it that's the issue.\n\nThe idea is that Lily will go through life thinking that the person she loves most in the world is at great risk of spending eternity in purgatory or hell. Not all the time. But she will wake up at night sometimes and listen to you breathe (well, snore, maybe) and wonder how to live with this knowledge. This has to actively hurt a person, unless they don't really believe much either.\n\nYou will spend your life thinking the person you love most, the beautiful, intelligent weirdo you share your deepest, most intimate thoughts with, is getting scammed weekly by a bunch of pervy old men who like kids. This has to erode the respect somewhere. Not all the time. But it does.\n\nI know some couples are said to manage this, but I'll be darned if I can understand how.", "NTA. I knew a non catholic who got married in a church. He had to get baptized and complete communion and confirmation to be allowed to be married in the church. Not sure what it's like where you are based but that's standard here.", "NTA\n\nI think you both didn't communicate this issue in depth. There's a lot of huge red flags here. She wants to force you to talk to the bishop and participate in her religious ceremony. That's not very respectful towards you. What hinders her to plan a secular wedding with you?\n\nFurther down the line, have you thought about the huge fights ahead of you once you have children? Baptism, communion, etc... I'm sorry to say that, but you two aren't as compatible as you probably thought.", "ESH because you both obviously underestimated eachothers commitment to your belief systems. And chose not to have a real talk about it until now.", "*Lily gave me a list of demands I would have to meet*\n\nGirl, no.\n\nFor us non-religious types, we often forget that religion is a thing.\n\nIt is a thing. And for Lily, believe it or not, it's a big thing.\n\nI would have another think about all this.\n\n(source: am former Catholic with some pretty full-on relatives)", "NTA. I know many will disagree but this is more than a check box for her clearly. There is also, like some have mentioned, the possibility that there will have to be agreement from OP to raise any children in the Catholic Church. This has occurred with several of my friends in this exact situation.", "NTA - but sounds like you\u2019re not actually that compatible. What will happen if and when you have children?", "NAH or maybe small NTA, but i am an atheist and my wife is religious. We married in a church it made her happy. We don't have or will get kids neither. Religion is not a part of my life with her. Yet it was a small part of the wedding. So the question is, is it really that important to you or can you just see it as some folklore?", "NTA this is a big deal for not just you but any further children you have, it doesn't stop at christening there is first communion and all the rest, will you attend these days ? You both need to sit down and discuss all of this before bringing any children into this. Weather it be couple's therepy please think this through Op as any future children are the ones who will suffer in the end. Good luck to both of you I hope you get this sorted.", "NTA, the wedding is one thing but you two are fundamentally not compatible. What religion are you going to raise your kids, will the be baptised?", "You two are incompatible. I wouldn't marry her. She needs the religious ceremony to not be in violation of her beliefs. If you aren't willing to participate, you are literally going to be contributing to her spending her afterlife in hell. (You don't have to understand or believe - she already thinks it true) Being an athiest, I don't believe but going into a church won't kill me (at least I haven't been struck down yet...)", "NAH. My cousin is a staunch atheist and he went through an expedited adult Catholic confirmation to get married in a church because that\u2019s what was important to his wife even if he doesn\u2019t care. You need to weigh whether you love your fianc\u00e9 enough todo stuff you don\u2019t care about to make her happy in order to get married. It\u2019s just a thing both of you need to figure out because it seems like it\u2019s a non negotiable at her end and you just don\u2019t want to.", "NAH. You two aren\u2019t compatible. Religion is obviously a very big part of her life and you don\u2019t want to participate in it. This is going to cause major issues long term. Today it\u2019s the wedding, a few years from now you\u2019ll be fighting about your child\u2019s baptism, years later it will be your child\u2019s confirmation ceremony. Not to be morbid, but what about funerals? If one of her loved ones passes away and that person has a Catholic funeral, will you attend? If she passes away before you, will you help organize a Catholic funeral? This is something that will come up at random times throughout your marriage so if you\u2019re not on the same page now, you never will be.", "NAH - you both have expectations, her expectation of you getting married and respecting her faith (which requires being married by a member of the clergy and taking part in marriage prep) isn\u2019t unreasonable. Your refusal due to your previous statements also isn\u2019t unreasonable because you made your feelings known ahead of time. \n\nBut there will be tons of religion in your life going forward. Does she only want to use Natural Family Planning? That might result in more children then you want. \nShe will want the kids baptized, something that will need your agreement. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably need to be there for their 1st Communion and such. \n\nYou and her need to talk about this and each of your expectations going forward before you decide if you want to move forward.", "NAH.\n\nIt sounds like while you discussed your religious differences you didn\u2019t discuss them enough and that ultimately you\u2019re not compatible. It sounds like she\u2019s trying to compromise but ultimately her religion is too important to her to completely put aside and you\u2019re too against religion to find any compromise. Both of your are right in your own way as religion is a big deal to compromise about.\n\nHave you talked about children? Because I have a feeling she\u2019ll want to raise them to go to church and I have a feeling you wouldn\u2019t be okay with that.\n\nYou both have to decide what\u2019s ultimately more important to you.", "NAH unfortunately marriage is a sacrament so there are religious requirements when it comes to Lily getting married, though she could get a dispensation for most parts (like a catholic wedding service). I\u2019m a lapsed Catholic raised by a lapsed Catholic, so I\u2019m a bit on shaky ground compared to someone in the thick of things.\n\nEdit: to clarify I did go to church as a kid and I have my sacrament checklist where it should be at this point.", "Technically NTA Do you mean full on mass or just a simple church ceremony? If it\u2019s a simple ceremony it\u2019s not all that different of a wedding. Just a few prayers and Bible readings thrown in. I think because it\u2019s important to your Fianc\u00e9 you might make concessions here but you could stick to your guns. Technically you are in the right. Just remember marriage is going to require a lot of give and take and in the scheme of things It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s asking for much.", "This isn't just a shrug your shoulders issue. \n\nMy Dad wasn't Catholic either, no was he practicing his religion. He married Mom in the rectory of her church, agreed to allow her to raise us Catholic, and we had only Catholic godparents. Created a family scandal because his siblings weren't. They eloped so no church wedding was needed.\n\nHe never kept us from church, thr sacraments, or celebrating the holidays - they were never from the religious aspect. He loved Christmas and Easter. When my siblings married it made their different religions even easier to assimilate into our families, since we recognize the holiday as celebratory, not religious.\n\nIf you're not willing to bend and flex where you're not forced to convert, then YTA, and need to find someone else to marry. Because her religion is important to her and she's not asking you to change, just compromise.", "INFO: have you discussed children? Whether you \"give in\" or she \"gives in\" when it comes to your wedding may be telling about the future. You may not care for religion but if she is as Catholic as she sounds, how comfortable are you with your kids being baptized? Communion? Confirmation? These are important events for Catholic kids and you'll have to step foot in a church then. Easter mass? Christmas mass? Fighting about where your wedding is is nothing compared to deciding your children's extracurricular/spiritual activities.", "NTA\n\nThis is just the beginning of her intertwining religion into your life. It will never end. And if  you have kids, they  will probably be forced as well. \n\nThink long and hard about someone who will never respect your boundaries. Ever. Not for yourself and not for any future joint kids.", "YTA \nYou said that you discussed religion before you became a couple. I dont think she thought she would have to give up her dream wedding to marry you.\n\nHaving a catholic wedding means mor to her than it does to not have one to you. Keep your crap in, go apoligize and marry that girl!", "NTA. But doesn't sound like it's a situation, where a \"compromise\" can be reached. Either you convince her that religion is BS or accept her religious practices. Whatever compromises you make now, it will get 10 times worse, when kids come along. Because I am sure you will want to teach your kids that religions are BS, while she will want to teach her religion.", "NAH but Catholic weddings are a huge deal for all of the Catholic people I know so I think you both are just incompatible in the long run. She\u2019ll want to Christen/baptize your future children, first communion will be super important for her for your kids, holidays will always look different for you two, etc. Are these issues you think you all will be able to compromise on if the wedding is already an issue?", "I am leaning towards NAH but she is being far too dismissive of your beliefs. Another poster has posed the question of if you two are truly compatible? You shouldn't have to compromise to the point of having a sacrament forced on you, especially for something as personal and special as your own wedding. \nConversely if the religious aspect of marriage is genuinely important to Lily then she should not have to give that up either. The only thing I would honestly ask her is if the religious sacrament really matters that much to her or if she is pushing this to appease other family members? The reason why ask is because this came up before my OH and I got married. I was very clear from day one I was not religious, I have actually formally opted out of the Catholic Church so have no intention of ever following any of the prescribed traditions for reasons which I feel very strongly about. My OH was raised Catholic in a very Catholic family but it was quite obvious that he does not practice or has any desire to (this is very common where I live). So when the question came up of whether or not I would consider a chrurch wedding I said it was unlikely that I would consider it for any reason but asked if it mattered to him to which he began with \"oh I couldn't give a hoot but....\" I let him finish but I said if he doesn't give a hoot then asking that kind of compromise off me was a bit rich to which he agreed. He had just genuinely never really thought about it because pleasing the parents had always been the easy option up to that point. I was very honest with him about my concerns, especially regarding future children, if religion was going to be an issue and that we should think carefully before making any further commitment. He was very quick to repeat religion meant nothing to him and he had just never really thought about other options being an actual thing. Is there even the smallest possibility that Lily hasn't fully thought about it herself?", "I don\u2019t understand how you\u2019ll manage kids in the future?\nYou know kids \u201cmost likely follow mom\u2019s religion\u201d\u2026so she will want to raise them Catholic. Even as far as Catholic school goes. Or Faith Camps in summer. \nDid you even think of that when proposing? i refuse to believe that a 31 yr old man didn\u2019t see that coming? That a Catholic woman wants to marry in her Catholic Church. I mean, Did you really not think that\u2019s what she would want? \n\nYTA not because you don\u2019t want to participate, but because you have miserably failed in having these conversations PRIOR.", "NTA.

If so, will they be Catholic? Would you be against that?\n\nIf so, you two may not be compatible.\n\nNah but if it is just for the wedding, I would probably go along with it. However, if she is making you do this for life, walk.", "NAH. Sorry, you are an incompatible couple.", "NTA. To get married in a Catholic Church, you have to promise that your children will be raised Catholic. If you are opposed to participating in her religion, I assume you don\u2019t want your kids crying at bedtime worried that Daddy\u2019s going to hell, either.", "Soft YTA\n\nI'm as atheistic as can be. I married a (not very) christian woman. But all her wishes don't strike me as particularly demanding. Just think of it as some kind of medival roleplay. It's a tradition, it's very important to her and if you really think that all this means nothing, where is the threat? Saying to a bishop that you won't pull her away from Catholicism? Sure. It's not like some big man in the sky will hold you accountable for that \\^\\^\n\nYou strike me as intolerant. Maybe the church is just that much more relaxed where I come from, so it's easier to tolerate, but boy. And as all others have said: If you are not willing to be tolerant on one of your wife's core believes, it won't get easier with you getting children.", "I think her asking you to spend 10 or 15 minutes meeting her bishop is absolutely a reasonable request. I wouldn't view this as asking you to participate in her religion as much as asking you to reassure an important person in her life about your intentions. Everything else beyond that I kind of find her to have gone back on her words. \n\nNTA...", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be forced to undertake a religious ceremony although religious people are very keen to rope people into their superstitions. You\u2019d also be required to agree to having any children raised in the religion, and how would this affect any potential divorce?", "ESH.  You have completely different value systems.  This relationship was always doomed to fail.", "NAH.  Still, you\u2019d be wise to have some deep discussions about her feelings and what the future will hold.  I married someone whose religious convictions were far deeper than she lead me to believe, and it lead to divorce.  She couldn\u2019t accept that I wouldn\u2019t warm to her beliefs, and I couldn\u2019t accept that she wanted me to believe some pretty ludicrous things with zero evidence.  If you two have different views on how to handle a pregnancy, or how to raise a child together, now is the time.  Forever is a long time to tolerate something you don\u2019t respect or agree with (that\u2019s true for both of you).", "NTA I\u2019m not sure your marriage will work if you both won\u2019t bend & she won\u2019t keep her word?

Plus I think you have to join the church. \n\nI was catholic and when I married my agnostic Lutheran x-husband, we got married by a  non catholic bishop instead (Lutheran I think.)", "The only way to have a wedding in a Catholic church is either be Catholic, convert beforehand, or promise to raise your kids Catholic if one of the parent's is Catholic.  These are laws of the church. \n\nI would tell Lily its a hard no for me.", "NAH.  Your early relationship discussion wasn't deep enough.  The wedding will just be the beginning.  What about kids?  How will they be raised?  You'll be expected to attend christenings, etc.  Major differences in religion are often a deal breaker in a relationship and it seems you've hit the wall.", "NAH. She is trying to compromise with you while maintaining something important to her. You are trying to stand your ground about your beliefs and not be forced to participate in a religion you don't belong to. As other commenters have mentioned, you *may* not be compatible as a couple, and you need to think about what religion your children would be in, etc. Many people marry someone more religious than they are and simply deal with the trappings as you have said you do, without making a fuss. If you no longer wish to be that way and it's important to you that you not be involved in any capacity, which is within your right, you need to think about whether you want to be with someone who is religious. This is clearly an important part of her identity, and if you're marrying her, to her that means completing the sacrament. If she has found a way for that to be done without you needing to be baptized by a personally progressive priest or at least one willing to turn their cheek, and she has said the main ceremony you invite friends to can be secular so you don't need to become a cause for concern, then you are either being difficult or you have encountered a turning point for your values. I have an ardent atheist friend who was married in a church with a preacher who mentioned the importance of faith. I don't know his wife's views, but he smiled through it and we all had a great time dancing that night. Can you envision yourself doing that to make yourself happy, then letting your future wife bring any children you have to church without you? Or are you so disgusted by this, perhaps due to some background experience you have, that you refuse to participate? None of us on this forum can tell you what to choose. You can't point to the results that say whether you should compromise your values or leave your fiance. You need to make that decision yourself, and there is no asshole to be thrown around.", "NTA.   She deliberately hid things from you.   She knew that these demands were going to come up.  You probably should have looked into it before hand,  but I can't really blame you for not.", "NTA. First of all, if you don't want a religious wedding, you shouldn't have to have one - it's your wedding too.\n\nSecond of all, what makes her think you even CAN get married in a Catholic church? I was raised Catholic - granted, it has been a WHILE since I've had anything to do with the church - but last I knew, both people have to be Catholic to get married in the church.\n\nThis may be flat-out incompatibility, but if you're looking for a compromise, see how she'd feel with a wedding outside the church but a Catholic priest attending to bless the marriage during the ceremony.", "You shouldn\u2019t be getting married if you can\u2019t compromise. She\u2019s catholic and you\u2019re not. She\u2019s not asking you to convert, she\u2019s willing to do a secular wedding to suit your taste, but you\u2019re not willing to check her box.

The thing is that marriage is all about finding compromises so you can work together as a team. \n\nYour fiancee really wants a Catholic wedding. Some of the stuff surrounding a Catholic wedding are actually useful, like the pre-Cana counseling which is essentially pre-marital counseling to make sure you two are on the same page regarding key things like kids, finances, etc. Meeting with a bishop is key to being allowed to get married in a Catholic Church to a non-Catholic.

We discussed religion before we ever became a couple. She told me she was Catholic, I told her I was not, and had no interest in converting. She said that was fine, as long as I was respectful toward her beliefs. So far, I have been. I keep quiet about my views on organized religion, I bow my head when her family says grace, I even tolerate her religious Christmas music without a complaint.\n\nWhen we started planning our wedding, Lily gave me a list of demands I would have to meet in order to marry her. I would have to meet with the bishop and promise not to pull her away from Catholicism. I would have to marry her in a church. I would have to participate in the Catholic wedding ceremony.\n\nLily insists that it isn't a big deal. The meeting with the bishop should only take 20 minutes, and the wedding should only take 45 minutes tops, so what's the big deal? The big deal is that Lily promised she wouldn't involve me in her religion. I told her I had no interest in stepping foot in a church ever. Now it seems like she's going back on her word.\n\nShe called me an AH because I flat-out refused to go through with it, even when she offered to do a secular ceremony in addition, or even as the main event.

It is inherently unfair.\n\nNAH but think hard about this, discuss it with your fianc\u00e9e and make sure you are treated with respect.

Have a wedding near a lake or some other stunning location in nature. In her viewpoint god created those places so he would definetely be a witness to the wedding, but you don't have to get married in a church.

She WILL do that, and even in the completely improbable case that she won't, they will be heavily confronted with religion in her family, and your vow \"not to pull her away from Catholicism\" and general demand for \"respect\" will be interpreted such that you will not be able to tell them your view on things.And remember that what they, specifically catholics, believe in is not \"Love your neighbor\", or \"be nice to other people\". They believe that an old man who lives in a golden palace in his own state and is head of an organisation with an unbroken criminal history from medieval land grabs over selling indulgences, over burning witches, over making deals with Nazis up to literally raping children is the representative of some Jesus Christ, who was tortured to death on the cross to redeem people from the sin some mystical first human couple has committed, which let his all-loving, all-mighty daddy to condemn all innocent generation afterwards.(And if you downvote me for this, I expect that you comment something else than WiTcHes MosTlY wEreN't Burnt By the ChuRcH that is factually wrong in what I just wrote.)\n\nI also got a girlfriend once who was catholic and once said \"you will rather convince me that I am a man than that I am not catholic\".

Luckily, it took around 6 months outside of her echo chamber to become as much of an atheist as one can be and a declared opponent of all organized religions.She is now my wife, not a man and mother of our religion-free son, but don't expect that to happen, take care of it first.\n\nOP, IF you want to get ahead with this, because your in-laws claim they would be fine with not raising them catholic, get, in writing, that they will also not set foot in a church, and will not attend christening, first communion and confirmation.", "NTA but dude rethink your shit.

If you were Catholic, you would both have to go to pre-canna classes which takes about 6 weeks. So, no. You are NTA, because, if she was truly a Catholic, she would know these things.

The kids and religion will be a big issue.\n\nAt the same time the demands she asking for aren't huge imo. Most non religious people get married in a church or ordained by an officiant. I come from a VERY blended religious family and mix blended religious culture. I'm Caribbean, my family is a mix of mostly Indo and some Afro Caribbean. I was baptized Catholic for school, my dad is a loose Hindu, my moms side is Muslim non practising and I'm agnostic. A very common way Carib people get married is just doing the church, with the minister then a big party and if you're family is Hindu or Muslim you have a Hindu (or Muslim) wedding then what we call the white dress wedding ( which is the church, cocktail party and reception). None of us come out of those weddings as baptized Christians after, unless you were religious before hand.\n\nMeeting with the priest for 20 minutes to cement that you won't take her away from Catholicism is not being indicted into the religion. I want to know why you're so hard pressed about that, because imagine if you talk to a stranger on the street and you don't know they're a priest or a rabbi or a Pandit or a Magee, are you all of a sudden being forced into that religion? Or say you meet someone at a BBQ and they happen to be a retired  Bishop. Religious freedom is a human right, but your boundaries seem really defensive and I feel like it's there bc people likely pushed you in the past but they are excessive.

The bishop might even ask if you want kids and if you\u2019ll bring them up catholic.\n\nMarrying into the catholic faith opens up a whole can of worms because a catholic person is raised to believe that marriage is for creating children and raising them to be catholic to save their souls.\n\nI saw this as an ex-catholic. You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave (unless you request excommunication, which is a damnable offense). I married in a civil ceremony and not totally sure my mom forgives me for it.\n\nNothing wrong with being catholic, but you should read more about the religion before you commit to marriage.

My husband said he would do all this if it was really important to me to get  married in a Catholic church but it wasn't (it was much more important to my family but they accepted it & didn't pressure us). I know of many people who have got married in a Catholic church and never go to mass.  Some priests (depending on where you are) will do a blessing and you can have a civil ceremony. This might appease your bride to be. Or you could just go along with it and smile & nod for your partner's sake and not regularly attend mass (though if she is a practising Catholic she may want your kids (if you have any)  baptised and their sacraments made.

She is really into Catholicism if she expects you to meet with a bishop and promise not to pull her away from her Catholic beliefs? Practices? How into it is she?  Most Catholics are Catholic INO. She sounds more hard core.

No? Good. You gonna try and stop her from practicing *her* faith? No? Splendid.\" And that was that. My Dad quite liked him.\n\nMy Mother wanted a Catholic Wedding. My Dad didn't care what flavour of wedding it was. So they went with Catholic because it didn't matter to him, but it mattered to her. On their 40 wedding anniversary, he took her to the Cathedral they got married and sat through mass. First time he stepped foot in a church in 35 years. It was a very romantic gesture I thought. Because it doesn't matter to him at all. But meant the world to her.\n\nIn their situation, the meeting with the bishop is fairly straightforward and I'd have issues with someone who claims to love someone not being able to truthfully answer those questions. That seems like no big deal if you ask me.\n\nBut again; only if your intention is to break your usual custom and marry in a Catholic Service in a Catholic Church.\n\nMy God Parents by contrast who married the same week were non practicing Anglicans. Anglicanism is a wierd religion in that you are entitled to an Anglican Baptism, Marriage and funeral, whether or not you're particularly religious, by virtue of being English. Hence Church of England. They wanted an Anglician service and had to jump through all sorts of hoops and religious classes to get it. My Dad always found that funny.\n\nThe thing here though, is that is if you're not a Catholic but nevertheless want to marry a Catholic in **a Catholic service**, that's what you jump through. Its basic courtesy *in that situation*, I would have thought. Hardly arduous. Just assuring that the local head of the church that you had basic respect for your partners religion. \n\nBut not if you don't want a Catholic Marriage.\n\nThe difference here is that OP seems shocked that she would *want* a Catholic wedding, and more importantly She seems surprised he wouldn't.\n\nAnd that suggests to me they haven't talked about this at all. Which is much more concerning. Have you actually told her \"I don't want to get married in a Church?\"\n\nYou're framing this as a list of demands rather than a discussion as to what your wedding should look like. It's not a good start to married life.", "I agree NAH, but within the Catholic Church, if you aren\u2019t married in the Church then you aren\u2019t married.

They still got married in a chapel because that was important to my SIL, but it wasn\u2019t a Catholic wedding. That\u2019s a compatible difference in my book. But this kind of irritation at the idea of doing a Catholic wedding because it\u2019s important to his partner? And frankly the irritation about her other mentioned religious habits?

The union is blessed by the priest. Pre-marital counseling is required so that all issues are addressed and on the table. You can express your concerns and non belief at this time.

I\u2019m pretty sure when the fianc\u00e9e insists on a Catholic wedding because of her faith, it will be also very important to her to baptise the children as well, and even if this maybe will be enough for her, she will be getting heavy flak from her family if the kids won\u2019t get at least some Catholic upbringing.", "Seriously consider all of this. Your children will be raised in the Church. Mass every weekend. Catechism. Sacrament events. You may not need to go to church all the time, but it will be expected that you show up for the sacramental events, like baptism where you vow, again in church to bring your child up in the faith. \n\nYour wedding isn't a one-off, unless you don't plan on a family. You really need deeper discussions with your fianc\u00e9 about how your family life will roll.", "Adding on to this, depending on the type she goes for as well the wedding could include a full mass which OP may feel pressured to take part in. Also if it does include a full mass it won\u2019t be a 45min wedding.\n\nThat said the fianc\u00e9 has offered a compromise in a secular wedding so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call her an outright AH.

Dropping the bomb of a list of \"requirements/demands/conditions\" once the engagement ring is on for the marriage to happen seems like either a gross miscommunication/assumption of knowledge or a foreboding game of hide the Catholicism. Bringing cultural or religious differences into a relationship is hard enough sometimes without not fully telling someone what they're signing up for, and this sounds a bit like OP has been trying to make steps toward the middle alone or that the middle/compromise was never fully discussed. \n\nOP, perhaps you two would be benefitted by a pre marriage counselor, depending on where you sit with this and how you two communicate in other spaces. Faith life for many is huge, and as many have mentioned, Catholicism has expectations of appropriate family ilfe, procreation, and a dozen other things you may just not know.

YOU would be excommunicated, and therefore not eligible to marry within the church.\n\nBut in this case, OP and his wife aren't going out of their way to prevent pregnancy, they're just not having much, if any, sex.  The church does not state a base line level of intimacy to maintain a marriage... while not consummating a marriage allows it to be annulled, not having an active sex life is NOT grounds.\n\nThe Catholic church does not say that all married couples must WANT children, it just says that WHEN engaging in sex, a married couple can not do anything that would prevent fertilization from happening if it was already going to.  Which is why The Rhythm Method is okay with the Catholic Church (avoiding having sex on the days a woman is most likely to conceive).

In Catholicism marriage is seen as a Holy Sacrament, in a similar realm of holiness as taking communion, getting baptized, or getting confirmed. For her to be considered married by her faith she actually *does* have to talk to the bishop and be married by a priest in a church, even though she is getting married to a non-Catholic, or else she will be considered \u201cunmarried\u201d in the eyes of her religion. Many devout Catholics will not feel \u201creally\u201d married if they don\u2019t do at least part of what the Catholic Church requires for getting married. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that you have to do all that she asks, just that that\u2019s probably the mindset where she is coming from. Would you at least be open to talking to the bishop- he\u2019s just a person and he\u2019s not going to demand that you pray or convert, he\u2019ll just want to have a conversation about your relationship and future marriage. He might also be able to answer some questions or concerns you have about your GF\u2019s wants for a Catholic wedding. Extending an olive branch like that might make your fianc\u00e9e be more open to compromise. \n\nAnother option is that you guys could go talk this out with a couples counselor. Having a neutral third party to help facilitate the conversation can be really useful during big disagreements on major life issues. I\u2019d highly recommend booking a session soon before this disagreement blows up  further. \n\nBut something else for you to seriously consider when it comes to Catholic/non-Catholic marriages: the Catholic Church also requires the Catholic parent to raise any kids in the Catholic faith. Are you ok with your fianc\u00e9e wanting to take any potential future children to church as well as getting them baptized, confirmed, and taking communion? Because if this is how strongly she feels about marriage then she\u2019s also likely to want to follow the church\u2019s teachings on raising kids too. \n\nHow you guys handle this will probably make or break your relationship, because religious beliefs can be a huge dealbreaker. If you want this to work then you\u2019re probably going to have to be ok with some religious stuff being apart of your life, and your fianc\u00e9e is going to have to be ok with not being able to do every religious practice she wants (or figure out a way to do them in a way that you are comfortable with).", "Are you sure yall are compatible?

I can ignore everything else. \n\nTo be so adamant about not stepping foot in a church suggests a level of animosity towards religion that I am surprised to see expressed by someone seeking to marry a religious person.

We found it really helpful in starting some conversations that needed to be had, and in establishing better communication. \n\nHowever I\u2019m sure the quality of this varies greatly depending on the individual church and therapist.

Of course, he also still has priest tasks that he's doing, like saying Mass or counseling parishioners, but often there's no way he can do it all on his own. So there's also curates, priests that work in said parish clusters who don't have these leadership roles. Some of them will be young priests who are slowly learning to take on these responsibilities, others are experienced priests who don't want to be managers and instead focus on teaching or writing.
