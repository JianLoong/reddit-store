You should NEVER be yelled at, guilt tripped, be told to apologize, ANY of those things, for not wanting to have sex. This is coercion. It\u2019s manipulative and abusive. You should not stay in a relationship with someone that behaves this way when rejected", "NTA. \n\nI recommend dumping her immediately. You don't have coitus if you ain't in the mood. You just don't. People can tell if you're in the mood or not, you can't fake something like that. Honestly if Lindsy was a good partner, she would definitely understood that you never saw that movie and would watch it with you.", "NTA\n\nConsent goes both ways. Just because she was in the mood and you werent doesnt mean you never want to in the future, just meant not then and there.   \nI suggest reevaluating your relationship with her because that was an event that most likely, unfortunately, not be the last.   \nNo one is ever entitled to your body.", "NTA - Consent goes both ways.", "NTA - You are allowed to not be in the mood.", "NTA.

That's not how normal people react to rejection", "LOL NTA you won\u2019t always be in the mood when your partner is like she isn\u2019t with you. If anything she owes you an apology fir the way she acted I mean what would she say if you just blew up at her over the same unhinged?", "You have every right to assert your boundaries. Just because you're in a relationship with somebody doesn't mean that you have to be sexual when they want.\n\nHer reaction was entirely disproportionate and she seems to equate you not being in the mood for sex as a personal rejection of her. She also equates it to you not finding her attractive.\n\nAlso, I'm going to be honest here, if the genders were reversed, and a man reacted like this in response to his girlfriend rejecting his advances, people would be telling her it's a red flag and to leave him. It's no different. Her behaviour is a huge red flag.", "nta. there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, hope she grows up and sees that as well.", "No is a complete sentence.\n\nNTA\n\nShe hurt her own feelings with whatever nonsense she told herself. don't be gaslit into thinking you did anything wrong.", "Nta nothing wrong with not being in the mood", "She wanted to Netflix and chill and you wanted to chill with Netflix.

You're allowed to not be in the mood and say no just as she is. You're not a sex toy and it sounds like she expects you to be one.", "NTA. If you're not in the mood, you're not in the mood.   \nYou don't owe her sex.  \n\n\nINFO: did you call her ugly?", "She sounds like a real keeper!!\n\nNTA.", "NTA imagine this same scenario and reverse the genders. What would you say to a buddy throwing their girlfriend out for not sleeping with them? She needs to grow up", "NTA. No means no, she is trying to guilt trip you into feeling bad when you did nothing wrong. You need to end this relationship, because that is a massive red flag.", "\u201cShe texts me saying I need to apologize for hurting her feelings and calling her ugly\u201d \n\nBut- according to the post- you didn\u2019t? You didn\u2019t call her ugly-\n\nOn a serious note, consent goes both ways. The moment she starts yelling at you for rejecting is the moment you reevaluate your relationship.

If she admits her mistake then she can probably be saved. If not it's good to know sooner.", "This sounds like the opposite of another post today from a woman saying her boyfriend started saying that he doesn\u2019t want her to initiate sex because it\u2019s emasculating and that he, as the alpha, should always be the one to initiate.

NTA", "NTA and I'm sorry you feel like you even need to ask. No means no. You weren't in the mood and she should've accepted that. Turning it into a big outburst about her self esteem and how she feels about being \"rejected\" is a huge red flag. Making you feel bad or asking you to apologize for not wanting to have sex is a huge red flag. Her actions are manipulative and that's a major problem. There should NEVER be manipulation when it comes to any sexual activity", "She\u2019s unhinged don\u2019t you dare apologize because you did nothing wrong dump her NTA", "NTA- it\u2019s in your best interest to drop her ass", "NTA\n\nNo means no.", "NTA-you're never the asshole for saying no, ESPECIALLY to sexual advances that you do not want and do not consent to. This is very abusive behavior, being yelled at, guilt tripped or anything like that for rejecting advances is a terrible thing and counts as sexual abuse. You need to get out of that relationship, like now, don't apologize and don't give in. your body is yours and yours alone, no means no.", "NTA - The worst thing you can do is apologise and let her escape accountability for her unreasonable behaviour.\n\nIn most male-female relationships/dating situations, women are normally the \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 of sex (especially at your age), so she\u2019s probably never been rejected before  when she\u2019s made a move and she has no idea how to process it. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong. \n\nThe reason you feel guilty and worried you did something wrong is because you\u2019ve probably made the same mistake most young men make. Too many young men approach dating with a mindset of \u201cdo what makes the woman feel happy\u201d in order to just get laid initially, without realising that\u2019s set the tone for the future relationship. Now anything you do that \u201cupsets\u201d her you now internalise as your failure to keep her happy and therefore you\u2019ve done something \u201cwrong\u201d even if you haven\u2019t. \n\nThe level of her overreaction and brazen attempts to manipulate you with suggestions you not being in the mood meant you called her ugly is deeply concerning. If the roles were reversed and you were trying to pressure her like she is with you, girl would be being told by her friends to run for the hills from an emotionally abusive jerk. If she\u2019s willing to be manipulative for this, what else will she resort to such tactics for? Something to think about here.", "NTA., but...\n\nWhy Spider Man? Why does that movie, of all movies, put your gf \"in the mood\"?\n\nThat is the million dollar question.\n\nEdit: Not saying that Spider Man is bad. I enjoyed the movie, but....it's not the most romantic lol.", "NTA.\n\nA person who gets this upset when their partner is not in the mood is in for a rough course, romantically.

NTA at all \n\nWow", "NTA.   \n\n\nDid she come to conclusion you called her ugly just because you refused her advances?   \n\n\nConsent goes both way so if one of the sides is not in the mood they have every right to refuse the advances. Neither of the sides should be yelled at or guit tripped into having sex.   \n\n\nOP your GF needs to learn how to handle rejection because you are not in the wrong, she is.

I think a lot of times people assume that men need to be in the mood or can be in the mood at anytime, but that\u2019s not true. Your partner should never get this upset when you\u2019re not in the mood.\n\nI do wonder if you communicate to her that you weren\u2019t in the mood and wanted to watch the movie? Or did you just move her hand away with no explanation?
