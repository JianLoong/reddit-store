She loves these shoes and wants to wear them everywhere. \n\nShe wore them to daycare on Tuesday and when I picked my daughter up, she was wearing a pair of socks from the school instead of her shoes. They asked me to send \u201cacceptable\u201d shoes in her backpack if she wants to wear her heels.\n\nWhen I got home, I checked the school\u2019s dress code and there was absolutely nothing about shoes, except that kids have to be able to comfortably play in them. My daughter is very comfortable in her heels (she wears them to the park, the grocery store, pretty much every time we leave the house and she never complains) so I didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with her wearing them to school. \n\nShe wore them again to school yesterday. Shortly after I dropped her off, I got a call from her teacher saying I needed to drop off a new pair of shoes but I was already at work so I couldn\u2019t get her a new pair. \n\nWhen I picked her up, it was the same thing. Her heels were in her backpack and she was wearing socks. The teacher told me they couldn\u2019t let her out for recess because of her shoes. \n\nI was livid when I was told that she couldn\u2019t play at recess because of her shoes. First of all, she\u2019s worn those shoes to the park so I know she can play in them. Second, it\u2019s not her fault that I couldn\u2019t drop off a new pair of shoes so I don\u2019t see why she has to be punished for it. \n\nI want to pull her out of this daycare and find a better one but my husband is refusing because his kids (he has kids from a previous marriage) went there and they all love it. \n\nI personally think they\u2019re treating my daughter unfairly and that we should look for a better daycare.

They asked you to send alternative shoes if she wears heels, you didn't. It doesn't matter that she hasn't been injured in little heels, the possibility of it happening is much higher than in proper playground footwear (sneakers). They're looking out for her safety and protecting themselves from a medical lawsuit. Pulling her out isn't helping her understand that rules are there for a reason. \n\nOn top of this, there are foot development issues to putting a toddler in heels. I would research it before I let her wear them daily, especially because light up princess heels are even less likely to offer proper support than other heels.", "YTA - Send your kids with proper clothing to any daycare or school. You were already told to send other shoes in her backpack to wear to recess. You deliberately did not. *You* caused her to miss recess.\n\nDaycares don\u2019t want to be liable for a kid who falls and gets hurt in their heels because their parent refused to pack other shoes. It\u2019s okay if you want to watch her as she is at a park, but keep in mind that you are only watching her and any other child in your family, while the staff at the daycare has to watch over many other children at once, and don\u2019t have an adult to every child. The heels become a liability then, and no place in charge of a child\u2019s welfare wants the risk of an added liability.\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s also just improper footwear. Heels are not playshoes and should not be used as them long-term. Little kids grow out of shoes so fast, and hers are rapidly growing confined in heels? That is not good for foot development.\n\nEDIT 2: Those aren\u2019t even SHOES. Those are TOYS. You know, dress-up, make-believe, *not something she should wear and play in and walk in for hours.* Those have no support for her feet!", "YTA, more than likely it\u2019s an insurance thing. If she\u2019s going outside on the playground her feet have to be covered. So if she loses a toe in her cute heels it\u2019s your own damn fault.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re Cinderella light up slippers or the old school slip on jeweled plastic heels. If they\u2019re not appropriate shoes for playing outside on the playground, then send shoes that are. Sneakers or something else with a hard sole. Are you asking for her to get injured? Or should she just sit inside during play time because you\u2019re too damn lazy to bring some other shoes? Those Cinderella jellies aren\u2019t going to protect her feet.", "YTA but by all means change her daycare. I\u2019m sure the employees will be glad to see you go.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine a parent being this upset over a daycare looking out for the safety of their child. If your daughter had been allowed to wear the heels and she had broken a leg or foot you\u2019d be furious that they allowed her out to play with them on. But because she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear them or go to recess you think she\u2019s being treated unfairly? Apparently you have some really messed up priorities.", "Whether she's comfy or not, your daughter should play in play shoes.  It's for her safety.  The school is protecting her, other kids, and themselves.", "Hold up. So you don't see how high heels may be a safety issue at a school? Even if it is just a few inches it can be dangerous. Also kudos on your kid for apparently being able to run around in high heels. It is a skill I have yet to master. YTA.", "I work for an ELC and the centers liability vs what YOU would do at home is nonexistent. If she twisted her ankle while running around on mulch and you  had to be called from work to go to the ER, would you be upset? YTA\n\nETA: you\u2019re the mom that all the teachers make fun of", "YTA. Just because you\u2019re comfortable with her in the heels, the daycare has a ethical and legal responsibility to ensure kids are safe. Just cause you said so doesn\u2019t mean they can ignore a pretty widely accepted safety protocol (ie: wearing appropriate footwear on the playground). Insisting that she goes and plays in heels puts the daycare staff in a bad position when some other kid insists they want to play in heels because your daughter did, but who knows how that girls parents feel about it. Your responsibility as a parent is to help your kids learn that they don\u2019t always get their way, and there\u2019s a time and place for everything.", "YTA. You sound... difficult.", "Hi, daycare teacher here. YTA. I would also not let a child outside to play in those shoes. As daycare/preschool teachers, we have a responsibility to keep your child safe, and those shoes are not safe. If she wears them on the playground with you and gets hurt, that's one thing. If she wears them to daycare and gets hurt, the daycare could be held responsible.\n\nShe loves to wear them and doesn't want to wear anything else? Well, too bad, you're her parent. Be a parent. Tell her she needs proper shoes for school, or at least pack them in her bag. You were already told by the teachers to bring proper shoes, you have no one to blame but yourself for her missing outside time.", "YTA\n\nI would be very surprised if any daycare allowed a two year old to play outside in heels. It\u2019s too much of a liability issue. Two year olds are incredibly prone to injuring themselves without the added risk of heels on play equipment. \n\nAlso, you knew that they weren\u2019t going to allow her to play in heels and you sent her in them anyway. If you wanted clarification on whether the heels were allowed, you should have asked on day one. \n\nIf you want to pull her out and move her to another daycare, more power to you but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get what you want out of this.", "Yta. It may be licensing requirements. Thats how the daycare I used to work at was. Children weren't allowed to wear those types of shoes and if they did the parents had to bring other shoes or they couldn't play outside. It can also depend on the weather outside. There was a kid at the daycare that burned their feet because they took off their princess heels to play outside. Theyre just being cautious not malicious.", "Yta. All schools have that policy even if it's not official. My 8 year old has to bring gym shoes for gym and they would probably have her change for recess. Winter shoes for outdoor recess. Heels for a 2 year old aren't appropriate all day. You throw the extra shoes in her backpack and when she needs to change the teacher will change them..", "YTA. they're shoes. very annoying, distracting, potentially dangerous (heels??) shoes. that is not worth the time and effort to leave and change entire schools over", "They told you if she was going to wear the heels, you needed to provide alternate footwear. You did not. This is a you problem. YTA", "YTA you sent her in heals, more than once! \nShe\u2019s not on a catwalk, she\u2019s playing with preschool blocks.  What\u2019s next when she moves up you complain about her makeup being complained on when she\u2019s 6", "YTA. Heels are actually quite harmful and they she can get hurt very easily. Just because she is using them at the park doesn't mean she should! Leave them at home. Heels are not appropriate for school.", "YTA. Those shoes are totally inappropriate for everyday wear and definitely for daycare. Also way too young for wearing them all the time. There is a developmental reason kids shors have flat bottoms and those are intended for periodic dressup playing.", "YTA there is absolutely no reason a (2) year old should be in heels.", "YTA\u2026.sorry but it falls on you to provide alternative shoes so she can wear the heels and be safe in an outside environment. You do what you want during your time, but if you are entrusting her to a daycare then you need to play by their rules. Wherever you move her to will require the same thing and you will be thrusting to into an unfamiliar place. Think of her ultimate best interest instead of your own sense of entitlement.", "YTA. The shoes you describe do not sound safe for a toddler to wear while running around outside at recess. You have different rules, you also don\u2019t run the risk of a parent suing you because your child got hurt running around in unsafe shoes at recess. \n\nThe school gave you a reasonable solution, it\u2019s your fault for not using it. You are the one punishing your child.", "YTA.\n\nThe shoes are unsafe for a 2 year old to outside on playground equipment in. You were asked more than once to send acceptable outdoor and play footwear and won't do so. They may also be a distraction or safety issue in the daycare room. \n\nThe daycare is perfectly fine. You just refuse to do what they asked so that your daughter can play. Keep the heels at home and send her in sneakers.", "Yta\n\nIt\u2019s a liability thing. Your kid doesn\u2019t get special treatment just because you think she\u2019ll play ok", "YTA- it\u2019s probably a safety thing. Also, you knew that the school didn\u2019t approve of her shoes, then sent her in the same shoes again. Even if it\u2019s not in the dress code, you could have had a conversation with them about why the shoes aren\u2019t acceptable", "YTA. You can watch your daughter 1-1 when she's with you. You have a way better chance to ensure her safety running around in heels. The teachers have a full class to deal with, and by necessity will need to take their eyes of each kid for lengths of time. That's why shoe rules are a lot more stringent at school than at home. It's a preemptive measure to make things safer in a non 1-1 environment.\n\nKids also play a lot more actively with each other in groups. The class i had last year, their favorite recess game was \"chase.\" Everyone decided together who was \"it\". Then they would chase him or her. Nonstop. For twenty minutes. My coteachers and I were constantly watching to make sure they stayed on grass, everyone was participating willingly, etc. I can't imagine the anxiety it would have caused all of us if one of those kids was in heels.", "YTA. It's a safety thing, not a dress code thing. If there's playground equipment, she could get seriously hurt and they would be liable by letting her wear her heels. Even if you have seen her play just fine, it's still a risk they aren't going to take.", "YTA. There is no way a two year old should be on a playground in heels, let alone wearing the all day. They should be saved for short periods of dress up.", "YTA you sound difficult and I hope all these responses help you wake up a tad", "YTA - the School made it clear that she needed an alternative pair of shoes and you ignored them. Thats why she missed recess. Any daycare that lets her wear those shoes is not going to be a better daycare.", "YTA, occasional play is one thing but your toddler should not be wearing heels every day. She should be in good supportive shoes for day care.  \n\nAlso, You knew they didn\u2019t want your daughter wearing those shoes and you ignored it.", " YTA. The teacher asked you to pack alternate shoes and you chose not to. This is a dumb hill to die on.", "YTA, it\u2019s an insurance/safety issue.  If they say yes to you, they have to say yes to everyone. The little heels hurt way more than tennis shoes on little fingers & accidental kicks. They were clear.", "YTA.", "YTA. It seems like it\u2019s just shoes. It\u2019s not. When you have 6 two year olds to care for and one has some pain in the butt shoes it is a major inconvenience to her, her classmates, and her teachers. Find a solution because they are not the problem here.", "Ok I see a lot of hate for OP, but I\u00b4m confused (not native english speaker)...\n\nDid she put on actual heels, as in stilettolike heels? Or are we talking about (as i initially understood it) just princes-themed shoes where the heels light up.", "Why are you allowing your 2 year old to wear heels?! Everywhere?! Her feet are not even fully developed yet. Don't allow your child to become physically disabled! GTFU and be a parent. YTA.", "1.) Light up shoes at nap time are a *nightmare*. Enough to ban them altogether at most schools. \n2.) She can\u2019t wear \u201cheels\u201d, slides or flip flops on the playground. It should be *obvious* this isn\u2019t appropriate footwear for a child, especially a 2yr old, when around dozens of other children.\n3.) Light up shoes, just like toys, are for playing- they stay at home. \n4.) YTA and you\u2019re oblivious to how you\u2019re arguing out of arrogance. What a joke. \n\nI imagine the daycare workers can\u2019t stand you and everyone rolls their eyes when you come up", "YTA- They may not be a skinny heel, but they do have a heel. Those shoes also have sh*t traction.\n\nI have a niece that pretty much only wears these- unless she\u2019s at daycare. Picking her up recently, she got excited, distracted and immediately lost traction and rolled her ankle.\n\nThe daycare has to protect themselves from potential injury/liability. That\u2019s exactly what these are.\n\nWhat a stupid hill to die on.", " YTA\n\nWhen you said \u2018heels\u2019, I thought you meant like \u2018My daughter has cool kicks.\u2019, not literal heels\u2026\n\nWho the fuck gives heels to a 2 year old? Do you think your daughter will care how pretty she looked at 2 when she gets crippled because of you? Heels cause issues to grown ass women let alone a toddler. \n\nGet proper footwear and don\u2019t let the heels become the primary footwear.", "YTA. I've looked at the shoes you linked, they are not safe play shoes. The heel is also too high for her to be wearing all the time. Use this as learning point for your daughter. She can start learning that she can't always get what she wants.", "YTA. You're sending a 2 year old to daycare in...HEELS? How do you not see that is grossly inappropriate?! The shoes are not suitable for playground use. If you want her to wear them to the park and play, that's on you. If they did let her on the playground and she fell and hurt herself, you'd be the first one screaming \"LAWSUIT\". \n\nLord, I hope you're a troll. You really seem to lack any sort of common sense here. 2 year olds are not known for their great agility and balance.", "YTA. From the link they look like plastic costume shoes, whether or not they're a heel doesn't matter that's still unsafe for outside play. You're obviously well within your rights to let her go to the park in them on your own time but for the daycare that's a liability. Just send her with backup shoes so she has the option to go outside if she wants.", "YTA - those are not shoes for playing outside safely and no daycare worth their salt would let a child play outside in them", "YTA and in denial regarding the comfort, safety and development of foot and gait. These are plastic shoes which are terrible for the feet anyway.\n\nHeels on a 2 year old - WTF When my daughter was 2 and 3 she also wanted to dress like a fairy princess bride but that consisted of wings, a tutu and a tiara and not clothing that actually impeded her ability to play comfortably and safely.\n\nYou are the mother and these are meant to be worn for dress up costumes or very limited indoor parties.\n\nChildren - especially toddlers need sturdy shoes that they won't slip out of. If she wants fancy shoes, get sneakers that light up as they have those or sturdy multicolored sandals for warm weather - not flip flops.", "YTA for putting a 2 year old in heels.", "Here's the thing. Your kid is only 2. You are just getting started. There will always be rules y'all have to follow. If you don't want to follow the rules then that will rub off on your daughter.", "YTA - light up princess heels are for dress up not the play ground. I don\u2019t care how she does in them when it\u2019s you and her hanging out. She\u2019s at a school with lots of other children who are more familiar with her and probably want to play vigorously. You\u2019re also asking the school to assume a tremendous amount of liability should something happen. What does their playground look like? What kind of material does it have? The shoes may not be suitable for that? is the playground at the recess, the same as the park you take her to? Wanting to pull her out of the daycare for such a trivial matter will only hurt her. Just send the second pair of shoes.", "YTA. In addition to the issue of the heels, you say they \"punished\" your child. Did they make her sit in a corner? Did they tell her she was bad for having the wrong shoes? Not likely. What probably happened is that one of the staff stayed inside with her and tried to distract her from the fact that all the other kids got to go outside. And the staff member was probably really nice to her, knowing it's not the kid's fault that her parents screwed up.", "YTA - she\u2019s 2. Daycare workers are watching a herd of 2 year olds, not just one. Certain things make their lives easier - which improves the care of the kids. It also is important to have independent play for kids, but maybe the workers feel like while your daughter is wearing those they have to be next to her the entire time. \n\nThey have to make sure she\u2019s ok climbing - they are liable if she slips and don\u2019t take chances. You\u2019ve seen your daughter playing in those shoes because you can be holding her hand every second outside at a playground, they might have to run to another kid and take their eyes off her for a second. They don\u2019t want to experiment with her in these shoes.\n\nThey have seen hundreds of 2 year olds in various clothing and the risks they pose. You have one who hasn\u2019t had an incident yet, this does not mean incidents don\u2019t happen. \n\nthey are expected to minimize risk. \n\nThey have to deal with angry parents over ruined clothing/ personal items. Sometimes it\u2019s not worth it and you just say \u201cI\u2019m not dealing with damaged favourite shoes, just wear something old and durable please\u201d. \n\nShoes fall off 2 year olds. Imagine you\u2019re constantly putting shoes back on eight 2 year olds continuously the entire time they are outside - not fun.", "YTA. The reason the dress code doesn\u2019t specifically say, \u201cno heels\u201d is because these poor people thought it was common sense. Like how dishwasher detergent contains warnings to not eat it. Now they\u2019re going to have to revise the manual, and every parent going forward is going to wonder who was the parent that sent their kid to daycare in heels.", "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re willing to take your kid out of daycare because of those shoes. Most likely any daycare you send her to will have the same rules. Those shoes are not the most practical footwear. On top of that they told you to send other shoes. Just send some other shoes. I can\u2019t wait until elementary school and she has to sneakers in gym class. What will you do then?", "YTA, sounds like daycare is looking out for your child\u2019s well-being.", "YTA. I read your post and thought oookay, americans have dresscodes for 2 year olds...but... I have three kids, including a two year old. I pictured these rainboots with light up heel and a princess pattern and thought what the f is the problem here? But the ones you linked? My kids wouldn't leave the house with them!

They told you nicely that she needed more appropriate shoes and you refused. I\u2019m sure the staff would be relieved if you pulled your daughter and they didn\u2019t have to deal with you anymore. YTA", "YTA. The school didn\u2019t make your daughter miss recess- you did. I mean I hear you that their policies could be clearer.

Personally, I would have expected different shoes too. I worked in daycares and child centers and I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with that. It\u2019s also likely the teacher did not make the rules. Once the kid I was para to in a preschool peed his pants and it dripped through to his socks/shoes. I cleaned him up of course and he had spare clothes/socks there but no spare shoes. I\u2019m not going to put a kid in pee shoes so he was going to be in socks. Rule is, you need shoes to be on the playground (maybe cause it was woodchip ground in the playground or fear of stomping on baby toes? Idk? I didn\u2019t make the rules, I followed them).

She doesn\u2019t know your special 2 year old is a master at heels.

I mean, honestly I can see why OP is upset, I do not understand how these are considered heels or how the heel would be an issue at play. \n\nIf an older child wore them I don't think it would be a problem, the 'heel' is barely there and kids old enough would be able to wear them fine. My only worry would be the heel getting stuck in playground equipment (resulting in either the kid crying for being stuck, or hurting themselves trying to get out). \n\nBut at two? 2-year-olds can barely walk with flat shoes.
