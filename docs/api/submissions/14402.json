That's the agreement they made. I would recommend getting locks on your bathroom door and any other doors leading into your personal space.", "NTA. \n\nIf the space the renter(s) were living in only had one bathroom, they'd figure it out. I grew up in a household with 2 adults and 4 kids, and you know what happened? We figured it out. Driving home from a long car ride? \"Ok, who needs to go first?\" Someone in there when you really needed to go? Quick knock to the door- \"hey, I reaaaaally need to use the bathroom!\" and they were out shortly. \n\nYour renter(s) is/are being completely disrespectful of your boundaries by assuming they can access your space in whatever they deem to be an emergency. They can figure it out.", "NTA. What would they have done if they lived in a space that only has one bathroom? That's essentially what they have, so they need to figure it out. Obviously it's feels harsh because it's a child, but many families with young kids live in spaces with only one bathrooms and make it work. They will continue to treat your bathroom as being available under x circumstances unless you hold firm that it isn't available under any circumstances. \n\nAnd going forward, you should put a lock on your private space.", "NTA.  The expectation of those upstairs should be that there is no available bathroom downstairs.

Whoever was in the shared bathroom should have accommodated the kid.", "NTA \n\n I get a lock for your space", "Nta.  If there was only one bathroom, they would figure it out.  Using your bathroom is just more convenient for them.", "NTA. You need to buy a lock for your door if you want to keep your space private. To me the renter who original violated your space would be gone. If it is in the lease that you don't enter my private space than you don't enter my private space. I can't live with people I don't trust. If I can't trust that no one will enter my personal space when I am gone then I cannot have you in my home.", "NTA. As far as your renters are concerned, your bathroom doesn't exist. It is explicitly mentioned in the lease. It's also not just a bathroom--it's your private bedroom. No one should be going in there. You aren't a monster--it is not your responsibility to accommodate your renters' guests. If there aren't sufficient bathrooms for the size of their party, they need to move their gathering elsewhere. \n\nGet a lock, highlight the portion of your lease that mentions your room/bathroom, and tell the tenant that thinks their convenience is more important than their lease that breaking the lease's stipulations puts them at risk for eviction. Hopefully it doesn't come to that, but if you can't trust them to respect your personal space and property, you may need to.", "NTA\n\nYour upstairs renters should just forget you have a bathroom.

It\u2019s your private space, letting anyone into it risks things being stolen, knocked over, etc. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting people in your room, especially strangers. That part of the house isn\u2019t to be accessed by the tenants and letting house guests use the downstairs washroom definitely sets a precedent. I\u2019m usually pretty lenient about things and go with the flow but it sounds like your renter is already pushing boundaries and this is just another one", "My family of 5 has a single bathroom. When we run into an issue, we don\u2019t guilt trip the neighbors into sharing theirs. NTA", "NAH. They asked, you said no. No worries.\n\nI\u2019ve got to be honest and say I probably would harbour a bit of resentment towards you if this was my child as it\u2019s a one-off, but I\u2019d respect your space.", "NAH\n\nIn this specific interaction, a request was made, and declined. Anyone making a request like that must square with the possibility of the request being declined. Requests like that being \"formalities\" or \"foregone conclusions\" are a sense of entitlement being displayed.\n\n*You* need to figure out your feelings. I understand and can appreciate where they come from. Your desire for privacy is valid, but we don't exist in a vacuum. Sometimes, for ethical reasons, we have to break rules, even our own, and this was a time when doing so would have been *fine.* Your feelings of guilt are the result of that.\n\nYou hadn't been in that situation before, and we can't expect to get the ethics right the first time, every time, and in this case, maintaining your boundary was just as ethical as allowing the child to use the bathroom.\n\nYou seem to feel that you could have bent on that, and that's fine. Next time, you have that option.", "NTA. \n\nEven though you are technically all living in the same house, it needs to be viewed as seperate people living in their own accomodations. It's like if you asked someone living in the apartment next to you if you could use their bathroom; it doesn't hurt to ask but there is absolutely NO obigation to say yes. Nobody is in the wrong here, unless they had the expectation that you should have said yes. (The renter who entered your space without asking while you were away is absolutely in the wrong.)\n\nEspecially since the use of your bathroom required them to enter your private living space. You have no oligation to let your neighbours into your \"property\".", "NAH. I totally get not wanting anyone in your spaces, but kids can have accidents. It's easy for me to say I would've let her, but I've yet to be in that situation.", "NTA, I'm sorry that you have to live with people like that, you seem like a nice person.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m a parent of two boys and neither are allowed to use my bathroom attached to my bedroom. I really just wanted one bathroom that didn\u2019t have tons of pee all over it. So that\u2019s the rule in my house.", "Mhmmm NAH perhaps, just depending on how the renters reacted. If they accepted your answer without issue then NAH but if they made a huge fuss about it then NTA.\nIt\u2019s your space that you pay for and you established you arent comfortable with them entering it. That\u2019s reasonable IMO.", "Coordinate usage ?? Do you think people can just inform their bowels when it\u2019s an appropriate time to be emptied ?? \n\nNTA, you are entitled to your own personal space that you pay for but expecting that everyone is able to stick to a bathroom schedule is sort of bizarre.", "i understand you point of view but small kids often dont know they need to go to the toilet until the last nano second there was a toilet that they could theoretically have used and as a person who prefers cats/dogs to kids i personally would have made an exception ... im going with ESH because someone abused your trust ... but its unfair to a kid to be punished because of irresponsible  disrespectful him", "[deleted]", "Morally YTA . A kid doesn\u2019t have the ability to \u201chold it\u201d to the capacity of an adult. If the adult was in middle of a movement that couldn\u2019t be stopped what\u2019s wrong with letting them use a bathroom quickly. It\u2019s not mismanagement- a kid has less physical ability to wait", "NAH. \n\nI appreciate my privacy too and hate knowing people have been in my space without my approval, just like you. But again, just like you, I\u2019d probably feel bad about denying a child to use my perfectly available bathroom.\n\nThey asked, you said no. That\u2019s fine. Also perfectly normal to feel bad. I feel like you wouldn\u2019t have been so inclined to deny the request if your space/arrangement hadn\u2019t been so recently violated without them even asking. We also don\u2019t know why the other washroom was so busy and why the child couldn\u2019t wait a little (since most people don\u2019t take more than a minute or two in the bathroom, which would\u2019ve been around the time it takes someone to assess the situation, decide to make the call, make the call etc etc). It could\u2019ve been an emergency and that would be an AH move on your part, but IDK if they said that over the phone. \n\nAll that said, you all should have a talk about this soon about this arrangement.", "*what kind of monster doesn\u2019t allow a small child to use their bathroom when they need to*\n\nSee how easy that is? YTA", "YTA specifically and solely for denying the child. \n\nSometimes coordination isn't going to be possible. Like when someone else is already in the bathroom and a 5 year old needs to potty.", "YTA. They called to ask, so it was clearly an emergency. Is there a reason why you choose to rent a house and let rooms out to other people, rather than just renting an apartment by yourself? Seems like you might be happier not having other people in your space at all.", "YTA let a kid use the restroom, it\u2019s not like you are constantly dealing with this and you weren\u2019t even home", "Yta.\n\nit Would have been the nice thing to do, regardless.", "Kinda YTA, this isn\u2019t \u201cam I within my rights\u201d (obviously yes, you had zero obligation to be accommodating)", "Yta, people can\u2019t just coordinate when they need to use a bathroom especially kids", "I will say YTA because you don't know their circumstances. It's possible someone has a form of IBD and can't control when they have to go or for how long.", "NAH. If you feel like a monster you could buy them a child\u2019s potty as a gift. But you don\u2019t need to feel that way, they explored a possible option and you explained that it was not actually a possibility. Your space is private. VIP only.", "Eh, you're kinda TA. I get why you made the lease provision and why you generally hold to it. That is 100% fine, totally your call, etc. But people can't always \"coordinate bathroom usage,\" especially a small child or if both people have food poisoning or something. I think if there's a real emergency, which sounds like this was because it was a little child and the other bathroom was full, it's decent to be a nice human for a moment. It's still your choice, but if I were them I would think you were a bit of a jerk even as I respected your wishes. It doesn't sound like it's been an issue since the one breach.", "NAH.  It's understandable that you value your personal space and privacy, but it's important to also consider the context of the situation. While it's not ideal that the shared bathroom was not available, it's not fair to deny a small child access to a bathroom when they need it.\n\nThat said, it's messed up that a renter barged into your room without asking. Maybe get a lock for your door to keep that from happening again. It's okay to be annoyed if the upstairs renters aren't respecting your space, but try to handle it with some empathy and understanding.\n\nIf you're worried about renters pushing your limits, stand your ground and don't let the previous offenders use your bathroom. But, cut some slack for those who can't hold it that well, like kids or elderly visitors. Maybe ask the renters to give you a heads up when they have guests like that, so you can be ready. This shows you're serious about your privacy but also flexible when given time to prepare. Like if I knew people were going to be entering my bedroom willy nilly, I\u2019d always have to make sure I don\u2019t leave undies lying around and what not (some people care more about what others think than others) and that\u2019s extra mental effort every day. But once off, that would be okay.\n\nSaying \"why are the upstairs renters putting their inability to coordinate bathroom usage on me\" comes across as dismissive and not considering their needs. Instead, it's better to approach the situation with a more considerate attitude. And maybe you did that, then no worries, no need to feel guilty. In fact, putting up this post suggests you were considerate. Remember that you live together and it helps to be considerate where possible, but you're also 100% correct if those renters don't treat you the same.\n\nIn the end, finding a solution that is fair and respectful to everyone involved should be the goal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
