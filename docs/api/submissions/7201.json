Then I noticed her playing with his hand, I looked at her with concern but she couldn\u2019t tell what I was trying to say. I decided to tug on her sleeve to get her to stop, but she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nThat\u2019s when i decided to softly pull her towards me to not cause a scene.

Your mother was absolutely wrong to touch the child and I think you handled the situation appropriately. \n\nI don\u2019t know where your mom gets the notion that this is some new \u201cwoke\u201d idea that the younger generation has conjured up. I\u2019m 40 and I know never to touch a stranger\u2019s child or really a stranger\u2019s anything for that matter. As a parent, I don\u2019t want anyone touching my child (though they\u2019re older now, so it\u2019s less likely that they\u2019ll be touched.)", "you've done a great service for moms with babies everywhere\n\nNTA", "Nta i hate when strangers touch my baby. Especially when there\u2019s so many diseases around, always older people though so i get it\u2019s a generational thing but still you don\u2019t go up to a random adult and start poking them and grabbing them", "NTA sounds like you handled this very gracefully for someone your age. It is totally rude to touch other people especially babies. In the post covid world too! \n\nIt's not your generation. I'm 10 years younger than your mom. I wouldn't touch an infants toddler unless I was saving it from death.", "NTA you are right, and it sounds like you were gentle and clear.", "So NTA. You were literally teaching your own mother about boundaries and manners.\n\nWhen my daughter wan an infant, she was a super cute baby. People were always waving and saying hi which was fine. I had 2 weird interactions, both at Costco. Once I was standing in front of my daughter while she sat in the cart. An old lady reached under my arm to grab her foot. She wasn't hurting her but it was really weird. I gently pushed her hand away and asked her to not touch my daughter. She didn't speak English so she just smiled the whole time and I walked away.\n\nThe second one an older couple walked past us and said hi to her. The husband put his hand on her head and gently grabbed it like he was picking up a ball (fingers around her head). He didn't hurt her but I very quickly said, \"Oh, please don't touch her!\" He quickly withdrew his hand and looked embarrassed. I think he realize what he did. I also quickly left after that. \n\nTL;DR- Don't touch other peoples kids unless you're protecting them from harm or protecting someone else/yourself.", "NTA. There's still a plague going around! Even if there wasn't you can't just touch people's kids.", "NTA you didn't know the baby or their parent. Don't touch other people's kids, without permission.\n\nI'm not that much younger than your mother. So I don't know why she's saying \"your generation\"", "NTA. U may have saved your mom from a real incident later. \n\nSince it was just a misunderstanding, and you're bothered. Talk to her. Tell her you don't mean to be harsh and just explain what you know. Tell her she can touch you instead \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA: Even if COVID wasn\u2019t a thing, it\u2019s totally inappropriate to touch someone else\u2019s baby without asking, period.", "NTA.\n\nI think parents, especially after COVID, don't want random people touching their children, even if they're friendly. Also to approach a child without introducing yourself to the parents is just plain weird and a red flag. \n\nI get the whole \"with your generation\" thing. *Some* things are getting a bit convoluted and hard to keep up with, but this isn't one of them. That's common sense, no matter what generation you are. Hell, even my 80-year-old grandad knows better.", "Nta\n\nThat is beyond wrong. Is there a cultural issue? That's the only reason I could see this being a thing.", "Oh sweetie NTA\n My mom (87f) and I (68f) had that discussion last week. Not about manners but the spread of RSV which is very real. She had no idea and thanked me for telling her. Then I hugged her and we went on about our day.", "NTA. And in a pandemic too? And in flu season? And with RSV taking down kids right and left? And with a shortage of children's medicine? Sorry, that takes her from TA to raging TA. You're NTA for moving her away from the kid before the mom saw and absolutely lost it on her. Edited: reading some of your other posts and that she's from a different cultural background, not a raging TA...but still very thoughtless with the health of a stranger's baby, so absolutely in TA zone for that alone. The aisles that are bare of children's cold, cough, fever, allergy, etc. medicine should tell her that this is absolutely STILL NOT the year to spread germs to babies.", "NTA. You're right.", "Well, as a mom, I can agree that it is really weird for someone to go up and start touching your baby. I remember when my kids were younger, I wouldn\u2019t even let strangers anywhere near them, and I didn\u2019t want my kids getting sick because of someone else\u2019s germs being transferred to them, and I knew what could happen if someone touched my kids\u2019 hands and then my babies put their hands in their mouths.\n\nNow, with RSV and COVID going around, it\u2019s never worth the risk.\n\nYour mom sounds like a really sweet lady who didn\u2019t mean any harm, but it\u2019s best to practice caution by not touching someone else\u2019s baby, not even their hands. Someone would feel really awful if they transferred something possibly deadly to them at their young age.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. But your mom is. As you already said, this is common sense. I don\u2019t ever want a stranger touching my kids. Ever. Even if Covid and rsv and the flu didn\u2019t exist, don\u2019t touch my kids. Period. It\u2019s gross and rude. I\u2019m glad you tried to intervene and it sounds like you did so with respect.", "NTA. There's a million things that the baby could catch from random strangers walking up to touch it, not even just COVID. If it was someone your mom knew, it would be much less of an issue. You *gently* pulled her aside to correct her, and were even whispering to avoid embarrassing her with the correction in public. She's the one that made a scene about it instead of just gently accepting the correction and moving on with your shopping trip.", "NAH - You did a good thing. But maybe she was right that she was raised in a way that allowed her behavior. So, if she is very sweet like you said, you could talk to her and say that maybe times have changed and now it is scarier when a stranger comes into physical contact with your child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should know that", "NTA.\n\nI will tell you something that I experienced last week with my 4 year old son when we visited the ER because of a small fracture in is leg:\nSince my son wasn't suffering in any major way, we weren't a priority that day. From the room we were waiting in, I could hear little babies (from their wails I knew they were infants and VERY sick). Like some have mentioned in the comments already, currently there are still quite a few cases of covid going around but also RSV which is highly contagious and can be life-threatening for young children to contract. These little babies in the ER that i heard crying and wailing had contracted RSV, the reason I know this is because the nurse who frantically rushed in and out of the room trying to tend to my son who also needed care told me that she was sorry we weren't a priority in spite of his injury, because there were so many RSV cases that they simply didn't have enough people available for the rest of the patients.\n\nYour mom could unknowingly have given that child something by touching them, it is possible to carry a disease without getting sick or show any symptoms.

In some places, caring for / interacting with other people\u2019s children is the norm. \n\nEven for me, I have to remind myself how ppl in North America feel about this and I grew up here. \n\nIn many other cultures, it would be strange *not to* play with, interact with a small child like that. Like even in North America, if I can tell a family is from the Caribbean / India, I\u2019ll smile at the kid and then the parent and that\u2019s a way of signaling that I\u2019m a friendly person. Those ppl smile back. With people from North America I do the reverse like I\u2019m asking permission. North American parents get nervous if you greet the child first.\n\nETA: NAH - I think asshole is a strong word to describe what is basically a misunderstanding about cultural differences. I know ppl here have their reasons to not want ppl touching their kids / COVID etc but overall, I can also see what a beautiful thing it is when children get to grow up in more communal societies where adults generally look out for little pals. \n\nIf you get a chance to see the Netflix show Old Enough which is set in Japan you can get a sense of what it\u2019s like elsewhere.", "According to my older sister, yes, it's fairly normal in Mexico to dote on and interact with babies even if they're not related.

Pre-Covid, it would have been frowned upon. Post-Covid (during Covid?), absolutely under no circumstances should you do this ever.  This has nothing to do with your generation.
