But 10% is usually a pretty common number. At that rate, that 5 months of your monthly salary would equal 50 months of your contributions to your joint savings. Over 4 years. Even if you were managing to put away 20%, that would still be just over 2 years of your contributions.\n\nIf I'm doing the math right, your wife makes just under 40% of what you do.

A good business plan is usually going to be at least 30 pages and have detailed financial projections and a well thought out strategy. If the owner can not provide this then the business idea is half-baked to begin with and not investable. If they can provide a plan then I would say look through it thoroughly, and potentially consider professional assistance in evaluating the financial components of the plan if you do not have the relevant skillset to do it yourself. After that you can discuss terms with the owner on what percentage of equity they will part with in return for your capital, or it could also be structured as a loan.
