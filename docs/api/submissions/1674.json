I wouldn't get it either had I not had my entire spare luggage allowance (I typically pack light and only take a carryon) used to ferry goods/gifts between my country and India when I visited a friend there a few years ago. Few simple simple questions clarified why. Some stuff is better quality or cheaper in USA or India and vice versa and it's a lot cheaper than shipping.\n\nIt doesn't intuitively make sense in an individualisic culture but it all works out in the end.", "The problem is that dried fruit will be confiscated by Customs. Another commenter posted a link to the government website.", "Asking a simple question is not \"trash talking\" \nIf OP had said \"her mom is a such a B-word she just made us pay for dried fruits and a whole suitcase!\" \nNow that would be trash talking. \nBut asking hey mom am I wrong for thinking this is a bit over the top to make us pay for? Is asking for advice, to know if you are being silly or not and if you should bring it up or not. There's a very big difference.\n\nAnd it was a private conversation. She didn't have to open it. After reading it. She should have brought it up with OP. Not send it to mommy and create a big drama that could have been solved with a conversation.", "Lol there's a difference between violating someone's privacy by reading their private texts and sending it to someone else without their permission vs hearing they thrash talking and then informing your mommy.\n\nThere. I broke it down for you so your tiny brain can comprehend it :)", "Nope. A Son texting his Moms is not.  100% she has conversations with her Moms that are private.

I\u2019m the age of the youngest boomers and figure I\u2019m closer to the age of young adults grandparents. I figure if someone is 22 their parents would be 45ish. Is something wrong with my math?", "Exactly. Also, relationships aren't seen as too transactional in these countries. The way all these people (everyone in the post, OP, and all the commenters) are reacting is just insane to me.", "This US govt website says dates and figs are generally ok but must always be declared:  \n\n\nhttps://www.dontpackapest.com/Can-I-Bring-It/Fruits-Vegetables6\n\nMost dried fruits and vegetables are not allowed into the United States without meeting special requirements to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases.

Are you the wife or her mom by any chance?", "That probably varies a lot from family to family and which child they are.

Friends have even brought back fried insects before. Most pests/containgons are just on fresh/living things.", "It doesn't matter.
