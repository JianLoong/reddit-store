Charlotte (15), Leo (13), Paige (11), Naomi (10), and Emilio (10). Charlotte, Naomi, and Emilio are adopted (all from different families) and Charlotte is the only one without a relationship with her bio family. Charlotte, Naomi, and Emilio also don\u2019t see my or my husbands family very often due to their views on adoption. \n\nCharlotte had a very rough year. I won\u2019t go into details but we had to pull her out of her school (one of the best private schools in the city) and homeschool her for the year. \n\nShe\u2019s finally ready to go back to school so a few months ago we applied to a group of private schools and she was accepted to all of them, including a very exclusive one that\u2019s one of the best in the state. She was accepted to this school years ago but we weren\u2019t able to make it happen due to the distance and the financial aid package offered but this time we have a much better financial aid package and they have a shuttle that will be picking her and some other students up from the train station. \n\nA month after all of this, we had a week where everyone except for Charlotte had some big event with their bio families. As a reward for her getting through everything this past year, getting accepted to her school, and to make up for not having a good extended family, I decided to take Charlotte for a week long mother daughter vacation. \n\nMy other kids were not happy with this. They say that it\u2019s not fair that Charlotte already gets to do more with her school (they go on some pretty cool trips, same with her old school) and I take her on cool vacations and not them. We go on family vacations but I don\u2019t take any of them away for more than one night very often because leaving my husband/him leaving me with 4 kids is pretty difficult. The only reason this week worked was because my bio kids were with their grandparents for 5 days, 2 kids is way easier than 4, and those 2 had all day events for half the week. \n\nMy husband does agree that it\u2019s unfair and thinks maybe we should do something without Charlotte to make up for it. I don\u2019t want to exclude Charlotte from a family event and we just can\u2019t agree.

I imagine that you would do the same for any of your other kids if they were in Charlotte's situation. Different kids have different needs. \n\nThat said, I'd like to note this:\n\n>Charlotte, Naomi, and Emilio also don\u2019t see my or my husbands family very often due to their views on adoption.\n\nThis implies to me that your non-adopted kids have relationships with your families, while your adopted kids do not. You're allowing your families to treat your kids as though they are not your kids. Adoptees have been very clear that this type of behavior is quite damaging. It also creates a divide between the adopted and non-adopted children. I know that's not what this post is about, but it should be food for thought.", ">Charlotte, Naomi, and Emilio also don\u2019t see my or my husbands family very often due to their views on adoption.\n\nwho the hell is against adoption??", "AH is too strong a word. If Naomi and Emilio were able to do things with their bio families and Naomi wasn't, that probably would have made her feel left out. It was nice you treated her. However, does that mean that your biological kids were the only ones who didn't get to do something fun? That seems unfair.", "I'm probably going to disagree with the majority here but at what point do the kids learn that everything is not fair?  I mean, is it fair they have trips/time with their bio families and Charlotte doesn't?  That doesn't seem fair, does Charlotte make a ordeal out of it?  Kids need to learn that you can't always get what you want, but you should appreciate what you have.  It sounds like you all have opened your heart and homes to these kids, and are doing the best you can for them all.  If one needs a little extra, once in a while, so be it.  It shouldn't be a competition.  What if one kid plays a sport and needs all the equipment, clothes, etc.... do you then have to make it fair and buy all the other kids new clothes, and stuff because of it?  No, that's not how it works.  NTA", "NTA Charlotte needs attention, too. Absolutely don\u2019t do something as a family without Charlotte! Shame on your husband for even suggesting that!\n\nJust try to do more one on one things with the other kids as you can. Y\u2019all might want to consider finding a good family therapist who specializes in adoption, in order to nip the jealousy in the bud now, especially since your husband isn\u2019t helping.", "NTA. Firstly, all of the kids who are complaining about a one time trip, contacts with their bio families regularly, Charlotte doesn't get to do that.\n\nSecondly, having one kid stay at home while all of the family goes on a trip sounds cruel. This isn't an eye for an eye situation.\n\nThirdly, Charlotte's accomplishments are her own. You're not using a big amount of your finances to get her to a private school. That argument isn't valid.\n\nKids are going to be kids and in a crowded family, they'll compare each other, that can't be helped but your husband should be an adult. I'm still shocked that he thinks it's fair to leave one of your kids home so that others feel happy again.\n\n\\*Edited to fix a mistake.", "NTA, unless the kids who went to their grandparents didn't want to go, and didn't actually have any fun.  It sounds like everyone got something here.  Two kids got to spend 5 days with their grandparents, two kids got to spend time with their dad and go on several fun days out with the school, and Charlotte got to spend the week with you.  And it sounds like Charlotte may have needed some extra help / coping / time.  While it shouldn't be a permanent state of affairs, the kid who needs more sometimes gets more.  \n\nHere, all the kids got something, but they may feel like Charlotte got a little more.  You may want to make sure everyone gets some mom time, by spending some individual time with each of them as you can, but taking everyone but Charlotte someplace is not going to help, and will only spur whatever competitive BS they have latched onto.\n\nParents who cater to the \"absolutely equal\" demand aren't doing their kids any favors, because life doesn't always work that way.  Things don't have to be equal all the time, but every kid should absolutely get \"enough\" - enough time, enough attention, enough help.  The measure of \"enough\" should not be what everyone else got, because sometimes one needs more while another needs less.  And sometimes they all need a lot.  But if they measure what they think they need by whatever someone else has, they will spend the rest of their lives wanting things that they may not be able to get, because \"it's not fair, the Joneses next door have one.\"  As long as they understand that all their needs (not necessarily all their wants) are being met they will be okay, but if they think that they have to compete for every scrap of affection, and that the way to do that is torpedo each other, they're going to grow up to be jerks as adults.", "NTA\n\nYou all probably have a great life for the most part. But written here, it just sounds really messed up. You have kids who are included by both of your family sides. And you have kids who are disrespected by both family sides. And you're wondering if doing something extra special for the one who has the least out of all of them is okay. \n\nAnother person commented about life not being fair. Maybe it isn't exactly fair to the other kids for you and Charlotte to have a special vacation. But it certainly isn't fair that she doesn't have a bio family that cares either. If you're going for fairness, what are you going to take away from the other kids to make it completely fair for Charlotte?", "NTA. Life isn\u2019t fair but you do the best that you can to balance things. The bio kids had family who took them on a trip to the beach house, you took Charlotte on a trip. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that kids think that they\u2019re always entitled to more than Charlotte because her bio family are crap - and awful that your husband\u2019s solution is to exclude her AGAIN. It seems like his attitude isn\u2019t too far from the horrible family who pointedly exclude the adopted kids. \n\nA one-off holiday doesn\u2019t make up for the holes in her life and you\u2019d hope that your kids would understand that. I hope she\u2019s much happier at the new school!", "Nah but you and your family (including husband) need to talk about how equality isn't the same.\n\nCharlotte got to go on a trip because her bio family sucks. You get to have experiences Charlotte doesn't because your bio family sucks less.", "NTA. But talk openly with the kids the reason for the same. Opening with asking them to remember all the fun they had with their extended families over the years. And how Charlotte didn't have any of it. Make them see your point well. And take them all out on vacation too, if you can afford it. Together.", "Charlotte is getting a reasonable equal reward. So, how is that a bad thing? I don't get that part. Its not elevating her above your other children or playing favorites when you just gave her a different reward than the others got because she was ineligible for the equal time.\n\nIts a replacement reward. That's all it is.\n\nNTA. People have fuzzy math in their heads sometimes and they confuse replacement with unequal.", "NAH.\n\nYou didn\u2019t have any bad intentions. But maybe you should have put it as something that Charlotte is doing with her family, like all the others have had, and not a reward? That makes it sound more like you\u2019re just making sure Charlotte isn\u2019t left out, instead of singling her out.", "gentle YTA. I see what you were trying to do, but at the end of the day your other kids were hurt by it, and likely felt you were prioritizing Charlotte over them. I get it's a challenge to do one on one trips, but maybe you can make it something like once each child turns 15 or 16, they get to have their one on one trip. That way, no one is left out and that spaces it out over time so hopefully it's more manageable.", "Maybe ask them if they'd be happy to swap having their bio families for holidays permanently. They each have something she doesn't have, she only has you & your husband. They should remember that.", "So\u2026.charlotte is the only one to get this weeks long mother daughter trip while your other kids find it is showing favortism\u2026.\n\nAnd your answer is that\u2026.charlotte doesnt have other family and they do so thats why she deserves a weeks long mother daughter trip while the others dont\u2026..\n\nI assume none of them gotten a week long trup with you\u2026when was the last time you guys did a whole family trip as good as this?", "YTA I see why you're doing it, but it does make you TA. Your kids will be hurt. And they'll remember it. Forever.", "INFO:\n\n>Charlotte had a very rough year. I won\u2019t go into details but we had to pull her out of her school (one of the best private schools in the city) and homeschool her for the year.\n\nWhy was she pulled from school?\n\nWhat kind of vacation was it?", "Kind of torn... Like I get it and reading other posts I agree that the kids need to realize that not everything is fair. But so does Charlotte. I agree with husband that it isn't necessarily fair. It almost seems like the other kids are being punished and are given the excuse of \"poor Charlotte\". Perspective is a huge factor here. And from their perspective, Charlotte goes to the better school, she gets a special trip...she must be the favorite.\n\nWhat happens when one of the other kids has a tough time? Are they getting a trip or because they have a relationship with bio family, that's their job? \n\nIt can be a slippery slope...what happens when college comes around or weddings, will Charlotte get more cause her bio family sucks? Just something to think about.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI feel like you're going to make the other kids resent her because from their point of view, Charlotte's been the \"troublemaker\" in a way. You had to pull her out of school and homeschool her, so she's already with you a lot. You had to go out of your way to get her back to school, and she gets to go to a fancy good school that she gets to do a bunch of cool stuff anyways. I'm not sure what their schooling situations are, but it just sounds like Charlotte gets a lot of things because she's more doted on by you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> maybe we should do something without Charlotte to make up for it.\n\nThat's fucked up, too, though??? So your husband's solution to fix your other kids' jealousy is to exclude Charlotte herself from something??? Talk about bad parenting.\n\nJust from this post, it sucks to know that while the other kids have a relationship with their bio families but Charlotte only has y'all. I can see why you want to take her on a trip to celebrate her life getting better, but maybe a mother-daughter spa day would've sufficed. You're a parent. You should understand that you have to be fair with all your kids. You can't celebrate one and think the others will be okay because they have something else preoccupying them.", "YTA\n\n>>I don\u2019t want to exclude Charlotte from a family event\n\nWelp", "YTA, though i understand there were good intentions. you could\u2019ve done something for a day together vs a week, there were other options, so it makes sense your other kids felt excluded since you chose to exclude them. you also understood how it\u2019d make charlotte feel if she was left out, which tells me you no doubt understand how your other kids feel being left out, because while they might have other family YOU are their mom. \n\ni would also have a serious talk with your husband about your adopted kids being left out of trips with their grandparents/whoever in the family, because that also further excludes kids and can have a lasting effect. \n\n2 of your kids out of this experience didn\u2019t have a trip / vacation with any family, because their grandparents don\u2019t accept them due to them being adopted and you chose to only take 1 child on a trip, so those 2 were excluded not once but twice over (regardless of their day events, that\u2019s not a trip/vacation).", "ESH, except the children. I genuinely don\u2019t understand how you or your husband think it\u2019s okay that your adoptive children are not treated equally. I also don\u2019t understand your husbands idea to exclude Charlotte specifically. \n\nIt is important that children are treated as equal as possible in blended families. All you two have done is allow animosity.", "NAH. I can see both sides, perhaps if you want to offer something up and say when each kid turns 15 they get a week with mom / dad for a special trip.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Second of all, they all have things Charlotte does not, ie bio families, and *they all ultimately got the same thing*-- a trip away from home. Thirdly, Charlotte is older and kids get different kinds of attention at different ages. Fourthly, surely they know their sister had a hard year. Ask them how they can be jealous of her, knowing how hard things have been for her? If any of them ever have a year so difficult they have to drop out of school, they can have special treatment then. \n\nThis is an important opportunity to teach your kids about empathy, equity, and fairness.
