I told her clearly that I wasn't happy with the situation and she got huffy and said that I had taken a year off work to help my son take care of his son. \n\nThis is absolutely true. I did that. I took a sabbatical to help my son who's wife was crippled in a car accident and was in rehab for a fucking year learning how to use her body again. I didn't say anything but the audacity was too much. \n\nWhen my daughter invited me out for this summer I politely declined and said that I had plans. She asked what I was doing and I truthfully told her that my boyfriend and I were spending the summer fixing up the house and camping. She said that Napa is more fun and that the kids want to see me. I said I had a week free in August that she could visit me in Spokane. She didn't like that idea. Now she isn't talking to me and I'm okay with it.

She just wants a free babysitter. It\u2019s sad how the daughter is so entitled.", "NTA- you should go visit your daughter but decline to do any babysitting .\n\nOffer to help out with a sitter so you can go out with your daughter and her husband, if she declines, then you know the real reason why she wants you there.", "NTA your daughter trying to guilt you by using, but the kids want to see you excuse makes her  TA. She wanted you to come visit her last time, but you ended up not actually seeing her and just being babysitter.", "NTA - first, love your vibe and you enjoy that morning wine. \n\nSecond, youre not free childcare.

Throwing up you helping care for your injured daughter in law??\n\nYour daughter just needs to woman up and tell you she wants you to come babysit. Sounds like that was the total extent of your last trip. \n\nI'd politely tell her no, you're going on a nice, relaxing vacation, not traveling to her to babysit.

In the previous, son wanted a relationship.\n* In this post, daughter pushed Op's stepping in for son's emergency as an excuse to get more babysitting.

Still got ripped apart unfairly", "I read the post and he was not attentive at all for the first 13 years.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t even a weekend dad . He had him two weekends a month and for a month in the summer til the boy was 13 and he moved in with him permanently (which OP hated). So he had plenty of free time to do what he wanted.\n\nThe resentment was palpable in that post. Being a good father is more that clothing and feeding a child .", "I clearly don\u2019t remember the post right, ignore me"]}
