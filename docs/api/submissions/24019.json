Still got ripped apart unfairly", "I read the post and he was not attentive at all for the first 13 years.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t even a weekend dad . He had him two weekends a month and for a month in the summer til the boy was 13 and he moved in with him permanently (which OP hated). So he had plenty of free time to do what he wanted.\n\nThe resentment was palpable in that post. Being a good father is more than just clothing and feeding a child .", "I clearly don\u2019t remember the post right, ignore me", "NTA - because they aren\u2019t your kids and you\u2019re not obligated to be a part of their lives in any capacity. \n\nHowever, I guess I can see this situation from your daughter\u2019s perspective. Being a parent can be exhausting and it\u2019s endless. Having support to take a break here or there for doctor\u2019s appointments, errands, and date nights is helpful to the parents\u2019 mental/emotional wellbeing. These moments can prevent burnout and relieve stress that will negatively impact the family. So while it\u2019s not an emergency, this kind of support can be associated with personal and family health. Many people rely on parents to get these breaks. Seeing you actively support her sibling for such an extended period may have created unrealistic expectations. \n\nI will concede if that these scenarios are very different:\n-Transparency and intention: I assume your son was up upfront with what he needed. So you went in to that situation knowing what to expect. Whereas your daughter set up a bait-and-switch situation. \n-  Consent: You always deserve the right right to say no or opt out of a situation. Since your daughter was not honest about her needs before you agreed to visit, she never got your consent. There is an argued to be made that even if she ask for consent while you were visiting, you being a guest in her home changes the dynamics and you felt pressured or coerced to agree. \n- Emergency vs. Self-care: your son\u2019s situation was health emergency or crisis. Furthermore, one of the parents was out of the picture completely, could not provide care for a long time. Whereas your daughter\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t a crisis, and both parents are healthy. Even if she need a mental health break, she never convey this need to you. \n\nOP - my only advice would be to try to have a respectful conversation with your daughter to clarify your boundaries on this topic. You seem a little too comfortable with letting your daughter stew in anger over your rejection to her summer plans. Maybe she is blind to the differences between the two situations\u2026 maybe not. \n\nOnce again, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re obligated to babysit for her at. I am saying that you can directly address the issue to prevent any lingering resentment and damage to your relationship. You can define your boundaries, explain how her behavior was disrespectful, and recalibrate her expectations for the kind of support she can expect from you. \n\nHopefully by having a calm, respectful conversation you can move forward without this topic becoming a repeating stressor in your relationship with your daughter\u2019s family.", "NTA but I do think you have to have a real convo about expectations with your daughter since you don\u2019t want an issue like to to really hurt your relationship. I have friends that fly their parents out to watch kids while on vacation and what you described is pretty normal. But it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re into that, and that\u2019s ok.", "I'm sorry.... what was the question again???\n\nSpend a summer watching someone else's kids for free or relaxing... there is no question there.\n\nNTA", "I LOVE your attitude.", "NTA\n\nGood for you!!!!\n\nBeing a grandma does not make you free daycare.  \n\nEnjoy your summer, your wine, and your boy toy!!!", "NTA.  She's just mad you wouldn't fall for it twice.", "Holy moly! NTA\n\nMy mom isn\u2019t retired and loves my son. We live a few hours away from each other. I would never assume that her visiting means that she\u2019s watching my kiddo. In fact I usually just spend time with both of them when we\u2019re all together. \n\nShe also travels a ton and is taking a sabbatical in Italy next year. I don\u2019t begrudge her any of this.

But a good try.", "I'd say that guy is NTA as well, but the OP here made her case much better. She comes across as totally sympathetic, while the other guy comes across less so.

If you were visiting for a few days, then you are more like a 'true' guest, and of course you'd want to spend as much time with the whole family as possible and not babysit solo for 2 nights.  But if you were there for a month, that's a little more like a temporary household member.  TBH, if I'm the daughter, for a several-weeks visit, I would have thought you were there largely to bond with the grandkids and that you wouldn't mind babysitting a couple of nights. Of course if you made it clear before hand that you didn't want to babysit and they ignored you and went out to dinner by themselves anyway, then daughter is clearly TA and I wouldn't go back there to visit either, unless I stayed at a hotel and had 100% control of my time.  But if it was more nuanced, I can see this from both sides.  For myself, I would have expected babysitting to be part of the visit if I were the grandma in that situation.", "Good for you. \"The kids want to see me\" is her euphemism for \"I want more free childcare.\"\n\nThat stunt they pulled about the dinner was really slimy.\n\nNTA", "Idk\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb here and say YTA for not trying to see your daughter and grandkids during the summer. \u201cNow she isn\u2019t talking to me and I\u2019m okay with it\u201d. Like are you really okay with your daughter not speaking with you? Can\u2019t you find some sort of compromise? This does read slightly like favoritism if you did spend a year supporting your son (I understand there were extenuating circumstances), but you\u2019re not going to try to make any time to see your daughter.

I think it's good you're saying no this time around - makes it clear for everyone.", ">I took a sabbatical to help my son who's wife was crippled in a car accident and was in rehab for a fucking year learning how to use her body again.\n\nI'm glad you were able to help them. NTA.", "Esh. She didn't have the right to expect that you would watch the kids and have dinner out with your husband but I'm wondering how many times this happened.  One night out alone with her husband and a few hours of errands if you were there for a week or two doesn't sound like something worth torpedoing your relationship with your daughter over.  \n\nYes the circumstances were different with your son, but so was the level of involvement.  I'm guessing you weren't just watching the kids for your son while he ran errands and so they could eat dinner out once a week.   \n\nI don't think it's unreasonable for your daughter to be salty that you complained about that relatively minor imposition.  \n\nMy husband and I have one kid and waited until our 40s and are financially secure.

Granted they were younger then but my mil doesn't even want to go outside if it's \"too hot\" read over 75F \n\nIt's hard for my husband to not feel like they care more about his sister.  Yeah, she needed more help and her husband wasn't a supportive partner.

My husband and I are going on a bucket list trip (1300mi road trip across the country with our dog)and I can\u2019t wait, it will be my first real vacation this year and I feel zero grandma-guilt.
