Why would someone take out loans to pay for college when there is actually money to cover the cost of school regardless? Everyone has heard of student loans. Everyone has also heard of way too many people never being able to pay them off. Why would you let your child start off her life in the hole financially if you were able to provide for her education?", "Ours is \"book smart, not street smart\"\n\nOP, I would be finding a way to talk to your daughter, point out that her education costs TWICE AS MUCH AS THE CHILD SUPPORT HER MOTHER RECEIVES to cover the costs of daughter living at home and also point out that daughter will be living at college there fore not living at home so why should OP be paying for two lots of accommodation.", "Make sure your daughter knows that you were going to support her through college. It's possible that her mom lied to force her home to get that money back.", "Your daughter should have factored costs into the decision and since she picked the most expensive school she should be taking loans to help. If she doesn\u2019t want loans she needs to attend a cheaper school. Do make sure to communicate directly with your daughter about the bills you are paying.  NTA", "NTA LOL what a selfish lady. havent they thought that you could just give money straight to your daughter now when she needs it? or like send her her own extra little set allowance if you want. ex is just upset cause now SHE gets less money. there is no reason you cant still give your daughter extra", "NTA", "NTA. If you were expected to pay, you should have been involved in these discussions. Maybe she would have picked a school where her scholarships were eligible.", "NTA - BUT I think you are a bit silly in not discussing this with your child up front.  She's 18.  You could have explained to her what you can pay before she made her choices.  If you had communicated directly with her then there would be no room for miscommunication by the mother either deliberately or by accident.", "NTA, your ex is mad because the money is no longer going to *her*. If it goes to your daughter while your daughter is away at school. ex can't get her fingers in it. If this isn't bait, she's been using it for herself and is telling your daughter lies about what actually happened.", "Yeah, I was going to ask if Bama has some specialty major that makes it worth $50K/year to go there. This sounds like a horrible return on investment. LSU is a party school too but has some majors that are respected", "I respect an engineering diploma from LSU. From Bama... not so much", "If your daughter is 18, why do you still have to pay her mother child support at all?", "OP, if she has a free ride to Purdue and is turning that down to pay $50K at Bama, you need to have a SERIOUS talk with her about college priorities.", "Yeah, I don't know why everyone is bashing the kid so hard. She's clearly being lied to.", "Child support ends on the child\u2019s 18th birthday. I small BS.", "NTA. Also, let\u2019s please not pretend like they chose Harvard over LSU. She\u2019s at Bama. It\u2019s a perfectly good school, but it sounds like she was just applying to perfectly good schools with fun football programs. I suspect your daughter was influenced by Bama Rush, but your ex was irresponsible in encouraging it. There was absolutely no reason for her to choose the only school for which she received zero financial aid.", "NTA at all", "No. That says it all. NTA!", "It sounds like you got child support reduced without talking to or involving your daughter or her mom at all. You might be an asshole for that. It really depends how your child support money is being used and what costs you are now covering in exchange for child support. For example, if child support helps her mom pay mortgage and daughter's food and clothes, mom still has to pay for those things while daughter is away at college (possibly not the food if you are paying for a meal plan at her college). It's also not clear whether your 53K includes room and board, books, or anything other than straight tuition.\n\nMy recommendation would be to offer to sit down with your daughter and her mom and actually look at expenses together. The idea being that you need to understand expenses to determine the appropriate level of child support. Mom needs to explain what your child support money currently covers; mom and daughter need to explain what costs are covered for college and what mom is still expecting to need child support for.\n\nMy thought is that you require daughter to be a part of the talk so that you know she is getting the full story of your level of monetary contribution. However, depending on how you get along with your daughter and her mom, it might be best to hash things out with mom alone first.", "That\u2019s what I said! It\u2019s utter madness to pay out of state tuition to attend a medium-average party school!", "Some states the end date is 19, others it is through college.", "I suspect mom didn't even tell her he's going to pay the 53K. She just said \"Dad isn't going to support you anymore unless you give up college. Tough luck, kid.\"", "I made a similar point, like, let\u2019s not pretend this was Harvard over LSU. Bama isn\u2019t super noteworthy for anything except football and Bama Rush (if you must). Sounds like she applied to a lot of medium-average schools, got financial aid from most of them, and chose the only one she didn\u2019t get any aid from. At out of state tuition rates, at that! It is wildly irresponsible to pay out of state tuition for a state school unless they have a uniquely excellent program for what one wishes to study, eg UT\u2019s Body Farm. Which, Bama does not, not for anyone out of state.", "damn, my parents divorced when I was in high school and I couldn't even get any lunch money", "They do not, as far as I know. It\u2019s a very good school if you\u2019re in-state, but completely average if not.", "If she wants to go to a 53k school, she can.  Is it a smart choice? F NO!  But she's 18 and if she wants to, she can.", "Wouldn\u2019t that support officially have been ending soon, anyway?", "Could be a third option: raised by gold digger.", "That, or they were overly influenced by Bama Rush.", "With daughter about to go to college you should bring both your ex and daughter to court so it can explained to daughter why support is being cut from her mom. It sounds like mom has been lying. Judges don't like that and have no problem putting AH parents in their place. \n\nNTA", "Wait, was Purdue an option?!"]}
