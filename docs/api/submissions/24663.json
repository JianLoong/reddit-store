You ARE supporting your child. To the tune of $53k a year. PLUS. She's home 3 months out of the year.You're still paying $6000 a year for 3 months of her living at home. That seems pretty generous to me. And she's an adult.  She can get a job.", "NTA. You don't just spring a $50k+ bill on someone two weeks before it's due, wow!\n\nReducing child support is an appropriate response to such an unbelievable demand, especially since it was assumed you'd pay for all of it, though if you did it without telling your ex I can see it would be a shock - but no more of a shock than you had.  What is your ex going to do when the support stops? Because it will be stopping at some point. \n\nYour ex sounds like a total nightmare and I'm sorry you have to deal with her.  This ALL could have been avoided had she simply included you in the process of choosing schools.", "Your wife (ex that is) still suffers from \"your money is our money, and my money is my money\" syndrome.\n\nYour wife did not do her due diligence in saving for her daughter's education cost, and neither did the daughter herself.\n\nIt is outrageous they expected you to pay all costs, and still pay child support.\n\nYou did what was more than fair.\n\nIf your daughter has to transfer to a local college, that is on her and her mother.\n\nNTA.\n\nEDIT - Come back in a few years and let us know how it went.  I wonder how your daughter's wedding will be financed?", "You should have a conversation with your daughter. \n\nShe is 18 years old and there is no need for your ex to be involved in communications between the two of you now. \n\nAsk her out to lunch and tell her the reality of the situation.  \n\nFrankly, your daughter should have been the one to tell you her plans and expectations of you paying well ahead of time. \n\nTalk to her like an adult - that is what she is - and stick to your guns. She\u2019s lucky to have a father that can provide the way you do. \n\nYou are being completely fair and reasonable. If she is smart, she will see past your ex\u2019s manipulations. NTA.", "NTA and the court agreed with you, so....  Why did your daughter choose the most expensive school that offered no scholarship money? That's an insane AH move if there ever was one.", "NTA.  Your daughter is clearly smart enough to understand basic math, and it's entirely possible that her mother has not been honest with her about the division of costs for college.   It's time to sit down and explain to her with a reduction of $1500 a month, with her mother not contributing half of her college expenses, you are more than doubling your monthly contribution to her life.   And mom's household expenses should go down if your daughter is no longer living with her as well.", "I am confused. Doesnt child support end when the child turns 18 since they are considered a legal adult?", "NTA: the mom wants to use you as a bank. Your daughter also out of pocket for not asking what you could help with but so glad to give you the bill. You spoiling your daughter by not teaching her better business practice. Only 2 weeks notice and automatically just demanding you pay for it is wild", "Uh, pretty sure paying that kinda money is absolutely supporting your child. I grew up knowing never to expect that kind of thing.\n\nYou know what? If your daughter is gonna be like that screw em. Is it too late to take back the money for college?\n\nNTA", "NTA. And I would take those texts to the court & have all future support severed. That is financial abuse & boarder line fraud.", "NTA!!! Part of being a responsible adult is making appropriate decision. Picking the one school you didn\u2019t get a scholarship to that\u2019s 50k a year when you could get a similar education for free is wrong on 5,000 levels. I would have told them you are willing to contribute x amount in total and go wirh it", "NTA-Honestly the mother is the asshole in this.", "NTA . It is extremely stupid to turn down excellent scholarships.  It is more idiotic that y'all didn't have in-depth conversations about college and funding prior to the bill coming due. Veto.. try again.  Her choice is not a valid choice unless she is going to take loans to pay on her own.... That makes it an invalid choice.\n\nAs far as child support.. right on!  If your daughter doesn't live ex anymore, ex doesn't get your money anymore.", "This feels off to me.\n\nUnless you're a football player, Alabama is a safety school.  You don't choose to go there if you have other options.  Especially options where you have scholarships.", "NTA and I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.\n\nAs for your daughter, it's time for her to get a job and apply for student loans for next year.\n\nAs for your ex, well, it's obvious why she's an ex.", "Who normally pays child support once the kid turns 18? NTA", "NTA.  Stand your ground on this one.  Her mother is trying to scare her to control both of you.", "I\u2019m sorry you had to give your daughter a wake up call, but this will certainly do her some good. I do question her judgement, especially choosing AL over LSU\u2026  :) jk", "NTA.  Your ex is taking advantage. Paying for your daughter\u2019s education costs plus the court mandated amount is plenty.  Honestly, you\u2019re a prince among men.", "NTA, you are paying your daughter's college expenses.

All you are is an ATM to them.", "NTA. Why are you still paying for regular child support at 18 though?", "For the state involved, can't you just pay the child support directly to your daughter now that she's 18?  The money is for the child, not the parent, now that she's 18, the money should go to your daughter directly.", "Who\u2026 who would pay out of state tuition to attend Alabama?", "nta f em. u did the job u were supposed to do. I'm sure there  will be the expected y t a coming your way by certain segments.", "Info you guys never heard of student loans?\n\nAlso, if she transfers to a cheaper school, you know her mom is going to have you back in court?", "ESH.

That's still 2k a month. She also is no longer a child and can work over the summer. \n\nOP's ex wife is lazy and entitled. She didn't put a single dime towards her daughter's education.

And your daughter turned down scholarships to go to the one (one!!) school that did not offer a scholarship? Sheesh.", "NTA. If you have a lawyer I would speak to them to see if they can have a conversation with your daughter because it sounds like your ex is feeding her a load of crap.

Mom isn't paying for college so she doesn't have any financial pull and your daughter is already there and has housing so it's not like she has to go back. Why is this all your fault when your daughter doesn't have to go?", "NTA. This is fucking insane. She could have gotten a good Education for 5-15K a year, but instead choose out of stake for 53K A year?? It\u2019s life your ex wife was purposely trying to fuck you over. Did they say WHY that school when she had so many more affordable options? You ARE supporting her by paying over 200K for her education, room and board. If she is out of the house and you are paying for all of that, your ex should be able to handle the reduction. Your ex is being petty and trying to turn her against you.", "NTA, as an alabama alumni there\u2019s a very high chance she will get scholarship for school. They give it out for good grades. Weird that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get one at all. Unless something went wrong.", "You sound stupid. She chose the school that would cost you the most money and you bent right over and took it. Open your eyes.", "NTA! You are supporting her.", "NTA. Looks like Mama saw the end of the gravy train and wants to back everything up to the way it was before. You can try saying it nicely, but you won't be paying double support. And going out of state to study at Alabama? That's a pretty dumb thing to do.", "If your daughter is so offended, then tell her to pay for college.   \n\n\nIt's a simple bluff to call", "She turned down scholarships to decent schools  without any discussion with you? Accepted Alabama with no financial resources without any discussion with you?\n\nSo you ponied up $50k for \u2018Bama and applied for a lower amount of child support?

He's paying his ex 2k a month for those three months that the kid isn't in school and for the dorms and meal plan for the remaining 9 months. Nothing else is owed. It's actually unconscionable that they chose to go to a school that was so much more expensive without being significantly higher ranked academically. There should have been a discussion at the very least before this decision was made.", "Thankfully we were never married. Dated in college broke up, found out she was pregnant after we broke up.

The cutoff age is 19, except it may continue through the college years if it was a condition of their divorce.", "Not necessarily. If the expectation has been that the child would go to university, then the parents are expected to pay. Expectations could be things like other children in the family went to university, the child did well in school and got scholarships, etc. It is a bit odd, because parents who are still together do not have to pay for college.", "Some divorce decrees include supporting a child through college.", "In several states it continues through college.", "It's a really big party school.  People go there to have an easy curriculum and party all the time.", "Right?? I wondered if mom wanted that school so she could stick it to dad??", "A lot of states go past 18 if the child is in college.", "If I had to guess, it probably has something to do with what major she chose. \n\nAnd also, Geaux Tigers!

Are you certain she really knows what's going on? \n\nI really can't imagine she'd respond the way she has if she knew how much you are actually supporting her, but I suppose I also don't know how much your ex has badmouthed you over the years. Is there any way to address this via the courts, since what she's doing is absolutely parental alienation? Might be worth looking into, especially since if mom really is lying, it's possible that all that needs to happen is that the court notify your daughter directly of these decisions.", "Correct it goes until 19 In Indiana unless there are post secondary education expenses. We were never married and we were broken up before my daughter was born. Happened while we were in college", "Op says they were never married", "Its also worth noting that such decrees may also include a stipulation that after 18, payments will go directly to the child, since they are of legal age and (theoretically) capable of managing their own finances. To say nothing of helping ensure that the kid actually gets the money, in case the parent that had custody was financially abusing them.", "Can you text your daughter or has she blocked you?\n\n If you can text her just explain what you have here and that she doesnt have to move back to her mothers. That her mother is lying to her as she wants more money, money she isnt owed as she is away at college.", "This is a tough one. \n\nKeep trying to talk to your daughter. Send her an email with a spreadsheet of the expenses you are paying related to her.  Reassure her that you are there for her and just say that there\u2019s clearly been a misunderstanding. You are not refusing to help her. You just want to be involved in the process and considered as well. \n\nYou are the dad and she might be 18 but that\u2019s still a kid.
