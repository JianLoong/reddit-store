Response: she can nap earlier. Shower is at 1130. They live 1h away. When will she nap? 8am? Additionally, they are saying I should take her home after shower so daughter has less time in car. But it would be same time in car (2h) if they took her back to theirs and then to mine as if I left from event straight to my place. I also have plans for after the shower since EX was supposed to have her the whole day. WIBTA if I kept my plans if they do decide to bring her to shower?

I think you need to be clear that this is his court ordered parenting time and it would not be appropriate for you to interfere with his time with his daughter. Why is he giving up his custody time anyways? Also unfair because you will be forced to parent at this event when presumably you could have hired a sitter if it was during your parenting time. NTA but this situation sucks.", "YWNBTA Keep your plans. And it might not be the right call for your daughter and I understand it will impact her slightly but you have to set boundaries now to keep things healthy for her long term which means he needs to figure out how to parent on his own and also deal with the evening consequences when he moves her nap. \n\nIf you take her, you\u2019ll be cancelling your plans and dealing with those consequences for him.", "INFO What does your ex say? Is he even aware that his mother intends to take away his time with his daughter?\n\nNTA but your selfish, boundary-stomping MIL is", "NTA, your ex and MIL are though. Kids grow up so fast. I\u2019m now experiencing empty nest and couldn\u2019t imagine not spending every second you can with them. \n\nTheir loss is your gain. Enjoy her while you can.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell your ex if he wants the baby at the shower, he better be attending it and dealing with her the entire time because it\u2019s his weekend. You can\u2019t control how he wants to spend his weekend with her, but as it\u2019s not yours, you\u2019re not responsible for her care and activities. If he wants a push back, say, \u201cmaybe we need to revisit the shared custody agreement as it seems you can\u2019t keep your weekends nor plan ahead of time if you\u2019re asking me to swap.\u201d Because let\u2019s be clear here, he\u2019s not asking you to swap. He\u2019s asking you to babysit your own child on his time during your event. That\u2019s not how it works. If he wants to swap the entire weekend, that\u2019s a different story and fully your prerogative to get a sitter or make an alternate plan for your event while you have her.", "YWNBTA.  Tell them straight out that it is his time and you are not going to be responsible for your child that day at all, that you have plans and will not be taking the child home.  If MIL brings her, MIL gets to deal with all the fall out.  If she comes to her, tell her to call the father since it is his time.", "EDIT: Not the asshole (NTA). Reasoning in comment below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI N F O\n\nLike, how affected do you think your daughter will be?\n\n\nDo you forsee this kind of thing happening a lot? (Your ex not sticking to the custody schedule that was pre-planned)\n\n\nBecause like, if its a one off thing and it wont really affect her other than having a cranky day, then I guess Id say you wouldnt be an asshole. But if like, you think it could be a recurring problem, then like, dont you think eventually your daughters gonna pick up on the fact you would rather keep your plans than do whats probably best for her? Or if its gonna be a big deal for some reason, like, wouldnt a parent step up to do whats right for their kid even when the other parent isnt being a good parent? Like, little one offs do not a bad parent make, but like, one big deal or repeatedly having little instances like this could like, really affect her. In which case everyone fucking sucks.", "YWNBTA but what's going to happen if MIL hands you your baby and says see you later? The baby will most likely want to be with you and won't understand if you try to force grandma to take her back. So even though you're right in that the baby should not be brought to a bridal shower during her normal naptime, and if she is brought anyway should be returned to her father, you probably aren't going to win this one.", "NTA. It sucks that they are putting you in this position though. Of course you would care for your daughter but then they take advantage of you when he\u2019s supposed to be taking care of her for the weekend. My husband and are together, and even when I\u2019m supposed to have some space to myself, if he brings the kids around me I get annoyed.", "NTA\n\nConsider whether you may get prefer to not attend this shower.  You could send a gift along with another family member and go straight on to your other plans with friends.  \n\nI recommend considering this because your Ex and his mother are using this event you control you.  By bringing your daughter, your MIL will force you to spend your time parenting a cranky kid instead of socializing.  And by handing your child over early, they ruin any plans you had for later in the day.  By not attending the event, you regain control over your day.  \n\nYou might also consider avoiding MIL as much as possible and leaving the shower early (without your child) and going on to your other plans.\n\nAt any rate, text your Ex to let him know that you aren't available to take daughter early and that you'll take her at the agreed upon place and time.", "NTA - tell MIL that baby will not be coming this time around, but you'd be happy to bring her over another time that works better for all of your schedules.  Stay firm. This shouldn't be a negotiation and this is YOUR daughter.", "ESH. They do suck, don't get me wrong. And you need alone time. But you're a mom first. Just take her home with you. But be petty about it lol \"Oh, I'm so glad to get to have more time with my baby since Daddy doesn't want to spend what little time he does get with her!\" Jk jk but not", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He argues with me on the regular that he does not have enough time with her but then turns around and does this? \n\nYou are entitled to think I am being selfish for wanting to keep plans I made. However I made them with the knowledge that she normally comes back to my house after 3pm. I would have been home in time for her regular drop off time with the plans I made and they are now changing it up last minute.", "We have very interconnected families. EX is best friends with my cousin 1, who is brother to cousin 2 (the one whose fiance's bridal shower is this weekend) So we will be interacting a lot in similar situations moving forward. \n\nDo I think she will be significantly impacted by this event ... no. If I give in now will they do the same thing in the future .... probably. Would I choose my own plans over her ... never. But I would not have these plans if she was supposed to be with me during that time.", "In reality I would not make her go back with them. We would go home and the person who I have plans with would understand. Mostly just not wanting to feel like TA for wanting to keep my plans that I never get to have. Even when we were still together I was the default parent. I went home with the baby while he went with everyone else to after parties. Every. Single. Time. My baby comes first for me always so without a doubt if she is at the shower she will be coming home with me, likely eaving early because she will be having tantrums from not napping. Thanks for the insight !", "Did you read the post?", "Parents deserve time without children too. Just because someone is a parent doesn\u2019t make their plans less important. Especially if they have a coparent that agreed to take care of the child.", "Oh no they weren't calling you selfish, they said that your ex-MIL is selfish and stomps boundaries.", "Ok. Then Im going to say NTA. Its valid and fair to make plans and not want to cancel them for like, a non emergency on the other parent's part. Especially if they will take advantage and trample your boundaries as a result. As long as this doesnt happen so much she starts to pick up on something being up, I think its ok to choose your plans over unexpectedly taking your daughter on a not-custody time for you. Otherwise youd never be able to plan anything.", "Now that I read it again, makes more sense. Thanks for clarifying!"]}
