Sorry about length too.\n   I\u2019ve (21f) been dating this man (32m) for 3 years. I want to begin by saying it started out well but in last year, i found out he cheated on me (physically and emotionally). I decided to stay to try to work through it because I really thought i loved him. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to last night, his cousin invited us out with his girlfriend. I said sure and off we went. When we got there, it was his cousin (33m), cousin\u2019s gf (24f) and her friend (24-25?f). Didn\u2019t think anything of it, had a good time regardless of the fact i was giving my bf looks because he kept glancing and breaking his neck for some women at the fest we were at, and then they invited us back to their place to play games and keep drinking. Cool. They decided to play drunknopoly? Never played before but it\u2019s basically a drinking version of monopoly. All the tasks were so far about drinking until cousin\u2019s gfs friend (whose the only single in the group), let\u2019s call her lora, got a \u201ctake off an article of clothing or take a shot\u201d card during her turn\nShe then proceeded to take a shot and THEN take off her shirt. \n\nNow i was a bit uncomfortable but didn\u2019t say anything right away. Now this is where things get a little weird. So I thought i heard cousins gf tell her friend lora \u201chow you just gonna take ur shirt off in front of my n***a?\u201d And she replied with something along the lines of \u201cidc what about it\u201d game goes on but lora kept talking weird so i just got fed up and said \u201cwell if u feeling like that then u can go ahead and put ur shirt back on, you\u2019re in a room full of couples. You don\u2019t respect your friends relationship?\u201d Then she got loud and defensive talking about how it\u2019s the game and then i asked cousins gf about what she had said previously but she denied ever telling her friend about her shirt.\n\n It was a bit embarrassing since my bf just kinda smirked at me getting yelled by this girl. His cousin was the one who reminded them that i had never played this game before. Games goes on and we all chill but lora kept throwing in snarky remarks every couple minutes passive aggressively towards me \u201cworried about what i got going on\u201d \u201cgod always got my back\u201d when i had to switch my pawn to last place. Overall, just being unnecessarily rude. While all these jabs were being thrown my way, my bf still wasn\u2019t saying nothing, he was actually chucking at some of the stuff she was saying. And then while we were about to go she got on facetime with someone and started talking mad shit about me and what happened and saying i was insecure. So i just said my goodbye to his cousin and gf and walked out. Bf and I didn\u2019t say a word to each other whole ride home, it\u2019s now the next morning and he\u2019s left for work. \n\nI\u2019m also getting second thoughts and wondering if i really was an ah and shouldn\u2019t have said anything.

Best of luck to you, truly.", "It\u2019s interesting to me how you were able to work up the courage to confront a complete stranger, but allow yourself to be treated like shit by your boyfriend. He never stopped cheating and he\u2019s never going to. He does not have your back at all.", "You all sound like trashy AHs", "ESH but you're not the biggest one, but the stupidest. For your own sake please dump that creep.", "That age gap was really all I needed, then I got all the extra info. NTA. I try not to throw this around, but I\u2019m getting predatory vibes from your bf. Y\u2019all started dating when you were a literal teenager and he was a full grown ass man. He\u2019s cheated more than once, I\u2019ll put money on that. And him just sitting them, chuckling and smirking while you were being disrespected? I also try not to say this, but leave this man. The only reason he\u2019s dating teenagers and super young girls is because no one his age wants to deal with his bullshit.", "NTA - First of all, you were being groomed...what were a 29 years old doing with a 18 years old??? This fact by itself should raise a sh*t bag of red flags. Second, he cheated. It should have been the end of it. Third and not least, he's looking at other women in obvious ways, beside you!!! Don't you find it disrespectful? Than when you are attacked in a gathering, he's smirking and finding it funny? I mean at this point you are asking the wrong question. You shouldn't be the one feeling discomfort at the view of an another woman nakedness, but your bf?? If he was loyal and respected your relationship, he would have voice his discomfort, backed you up or leave the situation. I think you should reevaluate your boundaries. How far can he push you before you leave?", "You were 18 and he was 30 when you started dating?\n\nYou\u2019re too emotionally immature and he\u2019s a disgusting predator", "\u201cI\u2019ve (21f) been dating this man (32m) for 3 years.\u201d\n\nEven if you guys had started dating at your current ages, this age gap would be a bit of a questionable stretch. Considering he was 29 and you were 18 when you met, that should have been red flag number one, but live and learn.\n\n\u201cI want to begin by saying it started out well but in last year, i found out he cheated on me (physically and emotionally).\u201d\n\nAnd we have red flag number 2.\n\n\u201cI decided to stay to try to work through it because I really thought i loved him.\u201d\n\nOk, people are able to work through things sometimes as long as there\u2019s genuine effort by all parties involved. But love is not always reason enough to stay or enough to make things work, and it\u2019s interesting that you say you **thought** you loved him.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think anything of it, had a good time regardless of the fact i was giving my bf looks because he kept glancing and breaking his neck for some women at the fest we were at, and then they invited us back to their place to play games and keep drinking.\u201d\n\nHappens to the best of us. But there is a point where it does get ridiculous.\n\n\u201cAll the tasks were so far about drinking until cousin\u2019s gfs friend (whose the only single in the group), let\u2019s call her lora, got a \u201ctake off an article of clothing or take a shot\u201d card during her turn\nShe then proceeded to take a shot and THEN take off her shirt.\u201d\n\nRules are rules \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\u201cNow i was a bit uncomfortable but didn\u2019t say anything right away. Now this is where things get a little weird. So I thought i heard cousins gf tell her friend lora \u2018how you just gonna take ur shirt off in front of my n***a?\u2019 And she replied with something along the lines of \u2018idc what about it\u2019 game goes on but lora kept talking weird so i just got fed up and said \u2018well if u feeling like that then u can go ahead and put ur shirt back on, you\u2019re in a room full of couples. You don\u2019t respect your friends relationship?\u2019 Then she got loud and defensive talking about how it\u2019s the game and then i asked cousins gf about what she had said previously but she denied ever telling her friend about her shirt.\u201d\n\nWell the game says take the shirt off, but does it say to keep it off? If it instructs her to keep it off, I kinda see where she\u2019s coming from and there\u2019s a discussion to be had. If it doesn\u2019t, she should have absolutely put it back on.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit embarrassing since my bf just kinda smirked at me getting yelled by this girl. His cousin was the one who reminded them that i had never played this game before. Games goes on and we all chill but lora kept throwing in snarky remarks every couple minutes passive aggressively towards me \u2018worried about what i got going on\u2019 \u2018god always got my back\u2019 when i had to switch my pawn to last place. Overall, just being unnecessarily rude.\u201d\n\nYeah, it\u2019s this part for me. She didn\u2019t need to make a scene out of the whole thing and insult people. Doesn\u2019t sound like a pleasant person.\n\n\u201cWhile all these jabs were being thrown my way, my bf still wasn\u2019t saying nothing, he was actually chucking at some of the stuff she was saying.\u201d\n\nBest case scenario he was very uncomfortable?\n\n\u201cAnd then while we were about to go she got on face-time with someone and started talking mad shit about me and what happened and saying i was insecure.\u201d\n\nYeah Lora sounds absolutely insufferable. You don\u2019t talk about someone as if they\u2019re not present. \n\n\u201cSo i just said my goodbye to his cousin and gf and walked out.\u201d\n\nGood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also getting second thoughts and wondering if i really was an ah and shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d\n\nYou may have overreacted a bit at first but her subsequent behavior was incredibly disrespectful.\n\n\u201cAITA for wanting to break w my bf over this as the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back AND for saying anything to lora in the first place?\u201d\n\nWhoa whoa whoa, how is this in any way your boyfriend\u2019s fault? The only thing he did wrong was not stick up for you when she started talking shit.\n\nESH. They didn\u2019t warn you about the spiciness of the game, you got mad at them for following the rules, they were extremely disrespectful to you, your boyfriend didn\u2019t stick up for you.", "YTA and you're very immature. Far, far too immature to be dating a man in his 30s, which is probably exactly why he picked you in the first place.\n\nIt's not disrespectful for her to take a top off in front of \"couples\". You would have to be wildly insecure in your relationship to be threatened by this.\n\nYou ARE wildly insecure in your relationship, because he cheated on you. Work out your insecurities with your boyfriend rather than taking them out on this woman.", "Babe really consider him- there is a reason he picked you and it isn\u2019t because you\u2019re so mature and he\u2019s never met someone like you. It\u2019s because women he doesn\u2019t have power over and a decade of life experience on don\u2019t put up with his shit.", "Stop dating people that don\u2019t like you/", "You are only 21, why are you putting up with this cheating creep who wouldn't even defend you?!", "nta but if you do not trust your boyfriend and stay with him after cheating on you that is on you if you put up with a cheater , once a cheater always a cheater", "INFO: was it mentioned in the rules that you're allowed to to both do the action and take a shot? Otherwise she did cheat at drunkopoly. \n\n\nAs", "ESH.\n\nIt's weird to take off your shirt unless it's really, really hot. You also put it back on when asked in someone's home, and she refused. That's why she sucks. \n\nHe cheated on you. That's why he sucks. \n\nYou say you want to work on it, but you're freaked out if he ever looks at another woman. This doesn't make you a jerk towards him; you're being the bad guy to yourself by staying with someone you don't feel you can trust. It's not worth it. \n\nI'm not mad at the brother and GF because this could just be something they're used to with this friend and aren't even thinking about it. So they're excluded from everyone.", "Seems to run in the family too. Did you see the age gap between cousin ad his gf? (33M/24F) Not as bad but still significant.", "groomed and disrespected, hate to see it.", "There's really not much more to say, other than: yes OP, break up, you're dating a guy that's 11 years older and already cheated on you at least once, plus doesn't seem to treat you the way you would like. What's the point of this relationship? \n\nI didn't get the part with the other woman but it's whatever, you said something she said something, you're not even friends, just forget about it.", "He knows a woman his age or at least a proper adult with a little bit of self-esteem won't put up with his cheating, lying ass. That's why he has to pursue little girls who don't respect themselves and think they're cool because of getting the attention of an older guy.", "29 even. 11 years age gap and the younger partner is 18 at the start, just absolutely disgusting.", "> You've also been together since you were 18 and he was 29, yes both adults but not something to write home about, but I'd hazard a guess that there's a few more red flags than just cheating in there.\n\nOP was and ADULT TEEN. There is a saying about men dating 18yo girls. They are like employers giving minimum wages, they would go lower if it was legal. Despite of being a (barely) adult, OP was groomed.", "100% agree with the breaking up. He\u2019s got no respect for her. He probably just sees her as a toy that can\u2019t stand up for herself. She was 18 and he 29 when they got together. Can\u2019t be healthy.", "Your stupid thinking an age gap is gross. Shit happens, don't talk about something you know nothing about. But I do agree with the rest of the stuff you said.", "Everyone in this story sucks. She\u2019ll leave him and get with someone else just like him.", ">That you were 18 and he was 29 when you got together sent red flags waving before I even got the cheating.\n\nSame. The first thing I look at in these stories are the ages of the people involved.\n\nOP is TA with regard to her friend, but definitely NTA if she breaks up with the boyfriend.", "lmao she's not the asshole for being groomed dude hahaha", "Nice job blaming the victim. I\u2019m sure you are the life of every party you go to.", "And I mean she was given reasons to be insecure and jealous, but still take it up with him or leave.", "this drives me crazy - men like this will make a woman the same age as them feel like she's past it but really those men are just *afraid* of women their age who will call them out on their bullshit.", "Amen - couldn\u2019t say it better myself", "Yeah that\u2019s just an ick for me to be honest. My wife and I met when I was 20 and she was 27, but it\u2019s not like it was because of my age. We are now happily married as of last week, and real partners support and love you regardless of age or whatever circumstances.\n\nThis guy just treats her like Leonardo DiCaprio does to the women he dates. Dates them, uses them, cheats on them, and degrades them.", "What kind of \u201cshit happens\u201d between an 18 and 29 year old? Other than the adult seeing someone  who is inexperienced, naive, and easy to take advantage of. Really what situation would that be normal in? 18 year olds are still in high school.", "It is gross. He was 29 and she was 18 when they started dating. That\u2019s ridiculous.", "A 28 year old adult going after a 17/18 year old child is fucking gross.", "Not for being groomed, but for maintaining a toxic relationship after he cheated,,,,and the second YTA is clearly for dating guys with that kind of age gap, which I explained and explained why it\u2019s a bad idea.", "I am not blaming any victim. SHe got mad at a girl at a party for playing a game becuase she is unsure about her relationship with her BF because HE cheated.\n\nHE is to blame for the trustissues because he cheated.\n\nSHE let her frustrations out on anohter girl who had nothign to do with it.", "Lmao how is this victim blaming when she\u2019s an adult that decided to stay with a man who cheated in every way possible on her and she was like \u201cI cAn ChAnGe HiM\u201d, even tho he was \u201cbreaking his neck for some women at the fest we were at\u201d. She should have left right that moment. And for sure Lora was invited for a reason, maybe the bf asked the cousin to bring her.", "How is she a victim? She popped off at the mouth and then got upset that the girl wasn\u2019t there for her shit? Had she not felt the need to say anything,  I could see her being a victim but she literally started this situation.", "Hahaha, this guy inseed sounds like a Leonardi DiCaprio type, and i feel like most people around 30 dating a teenager are like that. Of course there are exceptions and it can work sometimes, it really depends on their maturity i think. Congratz on getting married!", "Sureeeeee. That\u2019s what you had an issue with. That girl and the other couple are weird as fuck for playing a game that is clearly meant for single people or couples that are okay with experimenting. And if you read the post it says THEY decided to play the game, not her. So it\u2019s out of her hands. Use context clues and read the post before you look like an ass.", "Oh don\u2019t get me wrong, she has no spine for staying with a cheater. But she\u2019s clearly got some warped perception of what she wants in a man.", "Yeah but she\u2019s not TA for that. She\u2019s probably been so conditioned to this behavior from her boyfriend and just goes along with his behavior. OP is obviously trapped in an abusive relationship and retaliated for once because she felt the need to.", "I think it does depend on maturity. This guy is clearly not the right one for OP. \n\nAnd thank you!", "SHe played to. No one forced her.\n\nI don't even have a problem. I don't know these people.\n\nYou seem to make werid connections her. \n\nAre the men allowed at a pool? WOmen there onyl wear bikinis. Ohhh the horror.", "Christ how uptight can you be \ud83d\ude02", "Well, they\u2019ve been dating for 3 years, OP is 21 and the BF is 32, he\u2019s probably taken advantage of her youth to cheat and mold her in a way she won\u2019t leave and blame women instead of the real culprit. She\u2019s very young, hopefully she can realize this guy won\u2019t change and get out.", "Ah, so you\u2019re saying she is her boyfriends victim. I can\u2019t get behind her punishing someone else for her boyfriends crimes though, that\u2019s unacceptable regardless of what happens in her relationship.", "Look at the edit from OP, and then see just how wrong you are.", "Glad I wasn't the only one who went 'yikes!'  17 and 29 is WAY messed up.", "So you could see how she\u2019d be the victim and feel trapped in the relationship. You said it yourself, without me having to explain it.", "I\u2019ve seen the edit and am laughing at the both of you for being so ridiculously precious"]}
