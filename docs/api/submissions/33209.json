You were dating her for over a year and swung by her house, that\u2019s not a thing to be worried about (or shouldn\u2019t be in a half way healthy relationship).

Now you know she is no good. And it sounds like she tries manipulating you even separately from this situation. \n\nGet out of there, and then spend a year or so not in any relationship at all. Focus on you. Do some traveling. Figure out exactly what it is you want and who you really are. Your 20\u2019s are tough with relationships but it\u2019s also the last extended period of time you are likely to have the freedom to focus just on yourself. Get all that together and you\u2019ll end up having much healthier experiences going forward because you won\u2019t feel like you NEED a relationship, and by that you won\u2019t be settling for people who treat you like this person did (and sounds like others have as well). \n\nGood luck and sorry this happened to you.", "To all those saying you dont know she cheated, what else would they be doing late at night, alcohol induced, lights off?
