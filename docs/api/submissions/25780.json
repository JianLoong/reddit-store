In no small part to my extensive replies while sitting in an airport lounge on a layover \ud83d\ude02 I am still getting dms asking for an update so here goes. \n\nFirst, Thanks everyone for your advice, I received some really insightful messages and comments which were really helpful and heartfelt.\n\nLong story short we decided to have a session with a family mediator. It was me, my bf, Jenny, Nico, my parents, and Chelsea. I\u2019m not sure I can\u2019t fit in all the insights from the session so I\u2019ll keep to key things. \n\nFirstly, for all those wondering if Nico ever actually told Jenny what we said. Nico talked to Jenny about our concerns precisely twice, a third of the times we brought it up. She said it was presented to her as an offhand comment from our parents rather the intervention it was. \n\nSecond, Basically one of the main things that came up was how Nico kind of \u201csold\u201d our family to Jenny as a blended family she could slot into, and she got really invested in that. Nico said he kept hoping that it would all work itself out once Jenny felt more secure in their relationship. Then came the real crux. Jenny said she wasn\u2019t just looking for a relationship with Nico, but with a whole family. And we all had a long discussion about what that looked like for us in an ideal world, and it was vastly different. Then the mediator asked her the question \u201cif you never get the relationships you want from this family, do you think you\u2019ll still be able to have a happy relationship?\u201d And she said she didn\u2019t know. This kind of triggered Nico, who said he felt like Jenny was making him feel like he wasn\u2019t enough on his own, that she wanted a family from him more than a relationship with him. Then Jenny got upset and said why couldn\u2019t we all just try to be the family she needed. At which point my boyfriend had an uncharacteristic moment of insanity and went off on her, then he and I left the room. I was right in the middle of lecturing him when everyone else came out except Nico and Jenny and said that they need the rest of the session to discuss what had been said. \n\nNico came back to our parents\u2019 place later and said he and Jenny are \u201ctaking a beat\u201d because she\u2019s ruminating on what the mediator said and he\u2019s pretty crushed that she might not want to be with him if he doesn\u2019t come with a ready made family attached. He said he was prepared to pretty much give up a family for her, but she won\u2019t even give up the idea of one for him. He\u2019s now staying with my boyfriend and me until further notice. We haven\u2019t has any further conversations with him and Jenny, he\u2019s not in the headspace for it. If they stay together I foresee a lot more mediation. \n\nAt the end of the day, everyone on the thread was right in some way. I was an AH for saying what I said in the way I said it, and this conversation between all of us should have happened earlier.", "created_utc": 1693306284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164f4mz/update_aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 1160, "replies": ["This is so bizarre, what your boyfriend told her in his \"insanity\" moment?", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mb8ih/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fianc%C3%A9_that_we_dont/)", "This is sad all around, Jenny's looking for the family she never had (while breaking a lot of boundaries yes) and your brother is never going to be enough for her without it, I hope they just stay in therapy and not get married anytime soon.", "I think that she has boundary issues bc she's likely never experienced normal, healthy relationships. \n\nEverything is all in or all out and she hasn't experienced loving someone generally even if you aren't close (as some siblings may be) or friendships that are like siblings and others that are activity-related etc. \n\nHer expectations are wholly unrealistic so of course she thinks anything less isn't real or she's being rejected or cheated out of the real deal.", "OP post\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/pB9WUiyin6", "So basically Nico promised her something that he couldn\u2019t outright give her and just hoped it would work out so that she\u2019d agree to marry him?

And he was willing to throw his family away knowing that that\u2019s not what she wants but he just assumes if they both have no family then it\u2019s fine? This all sounds like Nico\u2019s fault honestly. He lied to her because he wanted her to marry him. He lied to you all and hoped with enough time either the lie would become true or he\u2019d have to cut contact with you all to keep up his lies. Somehow he\u2019s the victim though?

Maybe he can be honest with his next partner instead of causing them unnecessary grief.\n\nWhat did your boyfriend say to her ?

Lies. \n\nHe yelled at his family for not being what he lied to her about, what he promised her they would be. \n\nThen he yelled at her for not being content enough with reality after his lies all crumbled.\n\nShe needs therapy, but he\u2019s the real AH here. \n\nOP, did I get any of that wrong?\n\nEDIT: in fact the more I think about this, the worse he comes off. She came to him in an incredibly vulnerable state, and he left her exponentially worse! And if his family doesn\u2019t hold him accountable for this, he will remember this incident not as something he caused, but some \u201ccrazy ex girlfriend\u201d story.", "I\u2019m confused as to why your boyfriend was invited to the family mediator when the issue is Jenny being too involved in family matters as someone not involved in the family. And hugely inappropriate for him to lose his shit during mediation - what did he say? You really breezed over that aspect which I think is important.\n\nI\u2019m not saying anyone owes Jenny a family and she obviously has boundary issues but it does kind of seem like one rule for her and another for everyone else.", "NTA. \nJenny is NTA.\n\nYour brother is the AH. \n\nIt sounds like Jenny was upfront about her expectations, and she was mislead by your brother. \n\nYou and your family are entitled to boundaries. You conveyed to your brother on multiple occasions that you were uncomfortable (as well as directly to Jenny), and he did nothing to resolve this, nor did he communicate with Jenny. \n\nI feel sad for Jenny, but your brother redirecting her issues to the responsibility of your family is unacceptable.", "Your brother IS TA for lying to Jenny and expecting the rest of the family to deliver on the relationships she wants.", "Taking away the moment on insanity comment, can any of the people calling OP an A H honestly say they walked into a relationship with a new SO and immediately became 'family' with theirs?  Family relationships take work, just like friendships do.  Jenny expected to immediately become a 'sister', but it seems she never respected boundaries , so everyone else was uncomfortable. Nico could have relayed the issues a lot earlier and a lot clearer, and it may not have gotten to this point.  It seems the mediation was needed, and hopefully, everyone can learn from it.", "I think Nico is the villain in this story. People are allowed to have whatever standards they want for a relationship - it can be really important to someone that their partner not drink, or that their friends like their partner, or that their partner is religious. Your SIL made it clear to Nico that her standard is that she wanted a family that would embrace her and include her in things independent of her attachment to him. Tall order? Sure. Should she go to therapy and work through how reasonable that standard is? Probably. But she went into the relationship communicating that expectation, and he essentially dangled that carrot to keep her in it, despite hearing from you all that you were not wanting to be that for her or have that relationship with her (which is fine too! That\u2019s also a standard you\u2019re allowed to have).", "I'm trying to get it straight with the people calling you and your family TA in this situation - you are a blended family and it is pretty much consensus on this sub that noone should be assuming a close familial relationship in a blended family unless such a relationship naturally develops (sauce: any post where a step mum asks to be called Mum, step-siblings not wanting to have a sibling-like relationship, on and on and on).\n\nBut here, people are kicking off because a not-even-married into the family adult woman is not immediately let in into the most intimate connections family members who have known each other for years/their whole lives have - what in the fuck?\n\nThis is nuts. I understand she has had a most traumatising childhood, but even in your original post there is mention of your childhood being imperfect and not having what \"everyone else has just by being born\" in terms of family warmth and stability. I'd like to counteract that with the argument that everyone on the family bonding spectrum has difficulties dealing with their family and complications around feeling loved and accepted for who they are, of course this is amped up to the n-th scale for Jenny but it is not for you or your family to bear the cross, if not for any other reason but because having to pretend to be intimately close to someone when the feelings are not there is extremely hurtful to both sides and you can't just tell your heart to open up - people who are suggesting that that's possible on here are unhinged. \n\nFrom reading your original post it seems like you and your family repeatedly tried to establish a respectful boundary that would allow a relationship to flourish, but Jenny seemed unequipped to take the hints. Sometimes we want things to be a certain way so badly (Jenny wanting to be considered close family) that no gentle nudges can set us off course.", "OP, agree with others here that your brother is the real AH.  He lead Jenny to think that you all would accept her as family.  I also agree with others about **your BF** being there in a **family** meeting.  Why was \"HE\" there?  He isn't family or does your family accept him as family?!  If he is accepted as family where his input matters, then isn't that hypocritical?", "INFO: why was your BF at the mediation session? We\u2019re any other partners or spouses there.\n\nEither way, I hardly blame Jenny. It\u2019s weird you aren\u2019t all taking Nico to task for lying his way into a relationship. Sounds like Nico is a manipulator but your family doesn\u2019t seem to have very healthy dynamics anyway. \n\nI hope Jenny finds someone who will treat her right and your brother learns a hard lesson about misleading people he wants to be in romantic partnerships with.", "There's nothing \"wrong\" with Jenny. She has life trauma around being abandoned and rejected, and I feel there are much kinder ways to handle this. Y'all act like some closed elite club that she doesn't qualify for. And Nico pretty much told her these expectations were realistic, so a lot of this misunderstanding lies with him. After realizing her expectations (that she had because he told her she could) were not realistic, she's now reflecting. I honestly don't see how she's the WHOLE problem here. You're vilifying her for wanting a family. Even the way you talk about her...\n\n>Nico came back to our parents\u2019 place later and said he and Jenny are \u201ctaking a beat\u201d because she\u2019s ruminating on what the mediator said and he\u2019s pretty crushed that she might not want to be with him if he doesn\u2019t come with a ready made family attached. \n\n...like she's some spoiled brat who expects the world to bend to her, when in reality, you come across to me like someone with very little empathy and no desire to develop any.", "Jenny needs to dump Nico and look for a compatible man with a loving family that will accept her.", "Honestly she\u2019s weird for requesting your bf to be there, your brother is the bigger AH. You, your parents and bf aren\u2019t AH\u2019s. Your bf basically just said what you were all\nThinking.", "Gosh I don't like you. Just really don't like anything about you. You make several whole posts about boundary stomping and yet you bring your big mouth bf to mediation where he proceeds to berate the only person without family present who was truthfully answering a question she was asked. What the hell is wrong with you.\n\nMaybe Jenny is annoying and needy, but your whole family was unkind and judgemental. According to you she had zero family, raised in foster care and when she asked if someone could throw her a bridal shower or be her MoH that was a boundary ... Are you all just that cold hearted? You couldn't meet her somewhere in the middle just to be kind to a person who got dealt such a rotten hand.\n\nI think her leaving your step brother is for the best. I hope Jenny meets someone nice with a kind family who seeing as she doesn't have anyone will go to the tiny effort required to throw her a bridal shower.", "Yikes to the whole situation. Nico made ridiculous promises to manipulate Jenny into marrying him and never told his family about his expectations, and in fact when Jenny started pushing their comfort level he pretended to be on his family's side and lied about talking to Jenny about their boundaries. Jenny apparently had no real interest in just marrying Nico for himself, was lied to about what to expect from her inlaws, and had no baseline experience for the way families/inlaws function in real life. The rest of the family had their boundaries trampled on and were made to feel like the bad guys when really Nico was the AH all along.", "YTA\n\nYour bf is TA\n\nYour family is TA\n\nThis is so sad all around", "Jenny has watched 'While You Were Sleeping' one too many times.       \nJust my take on it.         \nHope things work out for your brother.", "NTA. Wow. This woman needs serious therapy, and your brother should probably go his separate way. Chances are she may never see \"one person\" as enough. She's going to either keep driving your family crazy, or she's going to leap on the next guy who has a big, loving family. Either way, I can't see them having a happy relationship. \n\nYour brother should be more honest with the next woman, it would have saved everyone a lot of time and stress.", "Why the fuck are your bf involved in this?", "All I think about is playing the Sims. Jenny would cheat the relationship to be 100% best friends. Even in the game you slowly build relationships without cheating. She wants every relationship to be solid without acknowledging it takes time to build these relationships. And that\u2019s normal for someone who marrying into the family. I also think OP\u2019s brother clearly gave her unrealistic expectations. She\u2019s coming in very strong and that can be a turn off to others. People were telling her to slow down, but she couldn\u2019t quiet seem to get it. Jenny needs therapy on healthy relationships and boundaries.", "Thank you for the update!  It was such a nuanced situation.  Your family rocks!  Willing to do a mediation (and it sounds like you found a good mediator) and to be honest and put the time in.  It is so much better for the truth to be out there - even if Nico is hurt right now.  And so much kinder to Jenny in the long run.  My SIL married young to get away from her parents (rightly) and got a ready made family with her husband's family.  For 20 years.  But the marriage wasn't good and when they broke up - no surprise - she lost that family.  Better than Jenny learn now than to be two kids into it, for the wrong reasons, and then lose it all.", "Someone link the original post, please!", "Jenny is the only one in this whole multi-part story that has an excuse to behave the way they have. The rest of the characters just seem rotten.", "> Jenny said she wasn\u2019t just looking for a relationship with Nico, but with a whole family.\n\nNico really needed to hear this. Jenny isn't emotionally ready to have a committed romantic relationship. She needs to resolve her trauma instead of trying to recreate the childhood she wished she had.\n\nNico was willing to help prop her up by offering the crutch she was looking for even though he knew he couldn't follow through. He lied and banked on everyone magically conforming without anyone being on the same page.", "Read your previous post and honestly Jenny needs therapy bc she has some major things to work through. It sounds like she has attachment issues and your brother fed into that. Honestly it sounds like your brother put his needs of having a relationship before actually making sure Jenny was secure  in the relationship first. Then should have come the introduction and building a familial relationship.", "Had a kind of similar situation as the boyfriend once but not as bad.\n\nMy MIL and wife were arguing with my FIL over elder care and possible elder abuse allegations for an aunt from her husband and step kids. He was saying he probably couldn\u2019t legally do anything. He was dragging his feet on getting a lawyer to even find out. I got frustrated being on the side lines and basically yelled at him about getting a lawyer because he doesn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\n\nNever seen a more \u201cdeer in the headlights\u201d look. Then he agreed to getting a lawyer. My wife said they almost yelled at me for yelling at their father but then it clicked what I said. Said that the only reason it even worked is because I never raise my voice ever and that alone was a shock. If anyone gets me to yell then they need to take a step back because maybe they\u2019re fucking up.\n\nOP said it was an \u201cuncharacteristic moment of insanity\u201d which suggests he\u2019s usually cool calm and collected. Probably should have been a red flag for her if someone she considered to be like that is blowing up then why isn\u2019t she when she\u2019s closer to the situation.", "Thanks.", "I hope he finds someone else. This girl comes with a lot of baggage and he is too young to need to deal with all that. Better a clean cut", "Completely agree. We can't gloss over how shitty Nico is in all this. He KNEW what she wanted and that is why he lied and misled everyone about the dynamic. For him to suddenly act like Jenny's very clearly stated wants are brand new information is extremely sketchy.   \n\n\nNotice how he is maneuvering himself to be a victim as the truth comes out? How he is the one who is hurt by...the expectation he created and perpetuated for his girlfriend regarding family? Interesting, isn't it?", "Yeah Nico didn't talk to her, or just kind of made the \"throw away comment\" to soften it, because he didn't WANT to tell her that her ready made family wasn't happening. He wanted to keep deceiving her into a marriage. He was willing to have a marriage based on a deception, but is now mad at HER. That's messed up.", "Yeah the attitude here is \u201cnobody owes you a family\u201d. Um, yeah, if that\u2019s what they promise you!", "But what reasonable person would take that as a given? Most people know relationships take time to develop but at least knowing they are a welcoming bunch.", "What I find odd is that he seemingly didn\u2019t let others know about expectations so they could have chosen for themselves and give gf pointers about family life", "BF has become close to the family because he's been there for a few years and had time to build a relationship. He probably hasn't said anything because he has no place in the situation. However, he's been watching everything from the sidelines and knows a lot of details since he's OPs BF. It sounds like the situation was so idiotic that he understandably snapped.\n\nIf you really boil it down it's:\n\nJenny: I want a family and am disregarding everyone else's wants for my own desires. I will hear no argument about it and am consciously choosing to dismiss the concerns of others.\n\nOP: But we don't know you well enough to be your family. We need time to create a relationship. It can't happen instantly.\n\nJenny: I want a family. I want it to happen instantly.\n\nThe way the post is worded makes it seem like the dialogue cycled between OP and her family asking for space and Jenny repeating something along the lines of that she didn't care about what other people wanted. Jenny refused to compromise but the family continued the conversation to try and convince her. This led to what happens when you try and argue with a toddler. The conversation will never end because the toddler isn't old enough to have the mental capacity to regulate what it wants and understand what that means. Like, it wants to touch the stove even if it's hot.\n\nBFs moment of insanity was probably the only thing that would've ended the conversation. Jenny doesn't want to face reality. OP needs to learn that they can't place expectations on Jenny because Jenny doesn't act like a reasonable person.", "He was invited because Jenny asked for him and Chelsea\u2019s boyfriend Ollie to be there. Ollie couldn\u2019t make it. \n\nHe basically said that Jenny has been very quick to tell everyone what she needs from them without stopping to think that she might also have to give something back, and that people don\u2019t exist to be what or who she needs them to be at any given time. He didn\u2019t yell or anything, but really I\u2019d have preferred if he\u2019d not said anything at all, even though he wasn\u2019t technically wrong in my opinion", "All of that is on the neither for lying to her. That's not OP, her family, or Jenny's fault. He brought this on.", "Per the original post, OP was uncomfortable with discussing her sex life and medications with Jenny, which are totally normal boundaries to have. Additionally OP's parents had to tell Jenny on multiple seperate occasions that they weren't comfortable with her calling them Mom and Dad. The family wasn't being needlessly cruel or excluding Jenny from events, they were just being reasonable people with healthy boundaries", "Because Jenny asked for him to be there", "I disagree; I don\u2019t feel like OP\u2019s family is acting elite. I would be uncomfortable if my sibling\u2019s BF/GF jumped in and expected an immediate intimate relationship (on level with asking sex questions like OP said), too. Relationships take time to develop, whether they be romantic, friendly, or familial. And OP and the family cared enough to try and resolve this with a family mediator - that is going beyond normal effort in my estimation.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: while Nico was 100% wrong in what he told Jenny, she is definitely giving the impression that he\u2019s just a means to the end of gaining the family she always wanted. If she doesn\u2019t love him on his own, family or no, then her intentions aren\u2019t wholly pure, either.", "Yeah some of the wording of this makes me feel gross.

Especially after all that has happened, that he'd do the same for you?", "Sure...I agree they have the right to dislike someone. But you don't have to vilify someone to do so. Just say you don't like them and move on. OP just seems like she's bashing her for validation, and that seems icky to me. The whole situation wreaks of being nice to someone's face and expressing dislike through passive aggressiveness and talking behind her back. Then Jenny picks up on the obvious, but everyone else just panders and invalidates her until someone (OP) finally does blow up about it and  it causes way more hurt feelings than was ever necessary if they had just stated boundaries more clearly from the get go. Problem is, Nico fueled her desire, and it has turned into something ridiculous.", "Why? She doesn't seem to have any empathy for Jenny.

Definitely important context", "I don't understand why he was even there. You get so upset with Jenny for inserting herself into family stuff, your bf isn't family, why was he there?", "Agreed, Nico is an AH for promising her a family but he probably thought she'd be satisfied with the normal level of affection families show to new partners. Friendly hugs, polite conversation, ect. He probably started panicking when she got in there and tried to talk about sex and therapy with his sisters (repeatedly, after they expressed discomfort) and he just doubled down on his promises instead of talking to Jenny about reasonable expectations.", "That\u2019s true. There\u2019s so much we\u2019ll never know.", "Except he didn't lie. He promised a welcoming family, and he gave her a welcoming family.

They know Jenny had personal communication and relationship issues, and they pretend that somehow it's Jenny's fault that their ideas don't appear in Jenny's head. \n\nIt's not that Jenny can't handle the truth.

I wonder if Jenny is neurodivergent bc she\u2019s taken it literally and lacks the understanding of boundaries.

This whole thing has been focused on Jenny's idea of what a perfect family should be like, and how she's going to get one - but the plain fact is that all families are different and OP and her family don't exist to be perfect accessories for Jenny to build a dolls house with.", "Agree with you there, Nico was definitely the biggest AH in this situation", "Asking him to be there =/= lashing out at Jenny and making her cry", "That\u2019s not what the problem really is though. It seems like OPs family is fine accepting partners if it happens more gradually over time. If OPs boyfriend was calling her parents mom and dad from the jump, then yeah that\u2019s unfair, but if he just slowly was integrated that\u2019s not any kind of double standard. Jenny wanted everything all it once and that was too much too soon. I don\u2019t see any reason to think that if she was a little more patient that she wouldn\u2019t have been considered family in time. The problem is that doesn\u2019t seem like what she wants. It appears she\u2019s looking for a ready made family to just immediately be fully integrated into and that\u2019s just not realistic. Especially when the stuff she seems to want to talk about is a bit much to just casually bring up in a lot of families even when you\u2019re close. \nI\u2019m also not sure Nico purposely misled her. We don\u2019t know exactly what the conversation was like, but it seems like a stretch to suggest that he promised her that his family would immediately be comfortable with that level of intimacy. I think they both talked about being \u201cpart of the family\u201d assuming the other had the same idea of what that meant. If he did promise her that intimacy of the bat, then he\u2019s an asshole, otherwise it\u2019s just another case of poor communication.", "Well, that's not really where I'm coming from. No, I don't think they should suck it up. I'm saying that they're handling it in a way that makes them come across as arrogant. I have said in other comments that I understand that Jenny has boundary issues, and they shouldn't be made to just accept that, but they're also handling it like \"mean girls\" by talking behind her back and passive aggressively avoiding her until OP blew up on her. That's not healthy on their part either, and OPs continual speaking about her in a way that makes her the whole problem says to me that she's just looking for validation rather than understanding. \n\nThey claim the issue is that she just expected to be a part of the family right off the bat. Maybe she did, but she's also seeing the others have a pretty close knit relationship, and Nico has encouraged her involvement. Making the issue about her wanting a family is a deflection. Especially now that we know that other significant others (OP's bf namely) ARE intimately included makes this argument look suspect, which Jenny likely picks up on. The issue is that they don't like her, and handling it this way sends mixed signals that they continue to malign her for. \n\nOP asked AITA by posting to this forum, so I'm evaluating her behavior at her request. It doesn't mean I don't have empathy for her or her other family members, but I think it's being handled with little emotional understanding on her part.", "Jenny asked for him to be there because she thought that no matter what he would be on her side.  That he wouldn\u2019t speak against her. \n\nThe fact of the matter is he spoke the truth. Any relationship/friendship/partnership/family is both give and take.  She was just taking which is toxic. And she needed to know that this isn\u2019t how this works.  Now could he have said it better.  Probably. But the fact is it needed to be said and he was probably the only person that could say it that she would listen to. \n\nThe thing is truth can be harsh, usually is harsh. He spoke up because it needed to be said and heard.  Because the rest of you can go around in circles all day long, but he got the point across. He stopped the circling and now she really needs to think about that and the other things that were said.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your brothers relationship because it sucks. But at some point it would have had to be addressed, because she needed that reality check. And it wasn\u2019t just about her asserting herself into a family that takes time to build. It was the fact that she probably could have, but she was so focused on her needs that she wasn\u2019t seeing/hearing/listening to what you guys said you needed to make it work. Which may have been a better way for him to phrase it.", "He is absolutely involved. And by the sounds of it it did need to be said. If Jenny is so emotionally immature that she just starts crying that is her fault, and no one else's. It was not insanity, and you have no place to tell him that he has to never express his thoughts just because he usually doesn't. You should apologize to him, as scolding him for expressing himself in a calm way is frankly pretty toxic of you", "No he didn't. He just gave her a much needed reality check and your all opinion on her behavior. And he's 100%right to do so.", "You're an AH to your partner. He should sit in the corner quietly while the \"real family\" talks?\n\nAnd it sounds like his \"moment of insanity\" was exactly what Jenny needed to hear.\n\nI hope you apologised to him.", "I disagree that it was unhelpful.

It was also the right time to say it.", "OP said Jenny requested his presence, but she has no problem saying no to folks who are not family. I a) don't trust OP's version of events and b) think if it is true, she should have shown the same level of courtesy to her BF and Jenny that she usually shows to non-family members.", "Fair point. I think he probably did expect her to be happy with just a normal welcoming family, but when she got pushy he didn't talk with her about adjusting her expectations. It seems to me like he ignored both his partner's and family's needs and just doubled down on his promise that they would be one big happy family. As we now know that was Jenny's entire motivation for marrying him and I'm sure there were indicators that their relationship was slipping away every time his family pulled back from her", "I feel bad for her too, but her actions are absolutely her fault.

Clearly she deeply desires a family and doesn\u2019t have a great idea of how to actually build the sort of relationship she wants.\nI hesitate to say that Nico willingly misled her. If he said \u201cmy family will treat you like you\u2019ve always been a part of it as soon as I introduce you\u201d, then no shit things went badly, but it seems more likely it was bad communication on both their parts. Her expectations were unrealistic but I don\u2019t get the feeling that they were communicated in detail. It seems more likely that \u201cpart of the family\u201d just meant different things to both of them and neither thought to try to square the definitions. The part where I start directly blaming Nico is once he was made aware that his Gf was rubbing other members of the family the wrong way because of a mismatch in expectations, he apparently didn\u2019t do the hard work of trying to actually solve that before it blew up how it did. \nShe has understandable desires and because of those she developed unreasonable expectations of OP\u2019s family and her bf failed to address things when it was clear there was a problem, but that doesn\u2019t make her continuing to try and force it after being told not to not her fault. I understand why she acted that way and she\u2019s clearly hurting, but it\u2019s still her fault when others get upset with her for pushing their reasonable boundaries.", "She can\u2019t complain about someone being involved who she asked to be involved tf", "This is a very stilted, maybe even stunted family. In the original thread the OP wrote at length on how she herself needed to earn her stepfather's affection as a child, and then how she moulded her boyfriend to click with her parents.

Okay so does that mean I deserved to be born to a mentally ill 16 year old and an imprisoned father? And that at 2 weeks old when I was adopted I needed to actually earn my way into the family. I know this is probably overreacting but there is so much adoption hate, and if I had ended up with the family I deserved I would absolutely be dead by now.", "What he said was wonderfully intelligent and insightful not insane. You shouldn\u2019t have got angry", "Not a moment of insanity, but rather the opposite.  It was definitely a moment of sanity to point out the Jenny is casting a family to fulfill her narrative. Chances are you brother best take this as a HUGE red flag and run like hell.", "He sold an orphan on the idea of a happy family that would accept her and love her right away. She was expecting cheaper by the dozen.\n\nAnd she got y\u2019all. \n\nYou are more than an AH for calling this a moment of sanity.

I'm considered so calm and soft spoken that the first time my friend heard of me raising my voice to my now wife, he straight up asked them \"What the fuck did you do to make him mad? I've never even heard him yell!\"", "The brother is the biggest fuck up for sure, but I don't think any of them come across particularly well. \n\nPlus, I ithink this just isn't the right fit. Like they got offended because Jenny assumed the mom would throw the bridal shower....except it's very, very common for the future MIL to throw the bridal shower (traditionally, it's the future MIL or the best friend, but usually the former). Same with the facebook thing. They got mad because Jenny reached out and announced the engagement to the entire family on FB. \n\nJenny was incredibly needy and ignored boundaries, but several aspects make me think this is a rather reserved, cold type of family who rejected her from the start...so she started pushing harder and then it spiraled.", "Did you not read the original post? Only the update?", "I agree. I think this is a cultural thing. I think Jenny crossed a ton of boundaries and behaved badly, but I also recall thinking OP's family sounded incredibly cold and reserved.

Jenny needs therapy. OP isn't her therapist.\n\nOP set boundaries from the beginning, openly said she wasn't comfortable discussing certain topics with Jenny, and asked her brother to talk to Jenny so she could have that conversation in private. That's not passive aggressive. You can be kind to people even if you don't personally like them.\n\nNico failed everyone here. But Jenny needs to learn how to accept a \"no\" the first time it's said.", "I read it in the opposite. I think OP meant that everyone deserves to be born into a loving family but sadly not everyone gets that and some of us need to work to build our family and support network.", "Wow, you're way overreacting and reading her comment completely wrong.", "LOL if you read OP's comments in the initial post they absolutely do not sound welcoming, at all. \n\nDon't get me wrong...Jenny needs intensive therapy and crossed a shit ton of boundaries. But OP's fam sounds cold and reserved.", "The brother said he was handling it, they thought he was. Came Out he wasn\u2019t . Not their problem, Jenny is still not out the clear. Yes she\u2019s right for thinking her bf shouldn\u2019t have said it, he was invited There by JENNY. Jenny can\u2019t handle it because as you can see she doesn\u2019t want a relationship if the family is not included.", "They're not therapists.\n\nThe reason we tell people to go to therapy is because the average person isn't going to know how to correctly identify what makes them uncomfortable about their interactions and word it in a way that a very traumatized person is going to understand and without hurting their feelings. There's going to be gaps in a person's knowledge that they're not capable of recognizing. That's why they went to counseling. To discuss it openly in a controlled environment with a professional who can bridge those gaps.\n\nRealistically it's not going to be something they recognize as a direct product of Jenny's trauma either.\n\nRealistically she's just someone that comes by every once in a while for a few hours while they're busy with their own lives. She has a few conversations with you and keeps demanding to know details about your intimate life. She's the girlfriend of someone you care about so you brush it off to not make a scene. People have jobs and families of their own to think about, their top priority isn't healing someone else's trauma or sitting down and parenting someone on a topic they've never thought about.\n\nHow do you explain to someone what a boundary is? How do you explain why your sex life is an uncomfortable topic to bring up? How do you do it in under two minutes with someone you barely know at an event you never thought about discussing this in?\n\nThis is why therapists have to study psychology. These are deep sociological and psychological questions that you need time to truly understand and recognize. It requires a level of self reflection that most aren't prepared to do.\n\nIn their conversations OP would directly say I'm not comfortable discussing this with you and Jenny would keep pushing it. Repeatedly. The behavior should have stopped there. That's what you can realistically expect from most people.", "The original post and this update comes across as selfish, spoiled, and self-absorbed", "Yeah that is exactly what she was saying. It was clear. But I can understand how it could be misread when some of the wording triggers very strong feelings for someone.", "I said I was probably overreacting.", "Funny how your first explanatory comment got 450 upvotes but this one is at -150 downvotes.   \n\nTo us, it seems like your boyfriends statement was A) valid B) correct C)  appropriate and D) necessary.\n\nFor you to drag him along but expect him to sit quietly and not weigh in is inappropriate.   \n\nIf he hadn't spoke up, now long would you have been sitting there going in circles?", "Have to disagree with you here. You were in a family therapy session in which he was included by request. He may not have chosen to be there of his own accord, but he was requested to be there and agreed to attend. This means that he too should be allowed to express his feelings and emotions relating to the issues at hand. He\u2019s not there simply as your partner, but as an individual involved in the situation. It sounds like the purpose of the session was to communicate everyone\u2019s point of view, it was *not* just to make things easier within the family because, frankly, therapy doesn\u2019t work like that.\nIf you didn\u2019t want him to express his emotions regarding the situation then he should not have attended, regardless of whether or not Jenny asked for it. I don\u2019t think it was right for you to lecture him for giving his side during a therapy session. It\u2019s not like you were having a family dinner in a restaurant and then he was rude.", "What an awful thing to say. I hope he leaves you.", "Why are you so controlling? Your family is creepy.", ">Jenny can\u2019t handle it because as you can see she doesn\u2019t want a relationship if the family is not included.\n\nShe can handle it just fine, by breaking up with a toxic manipulative liar. **Everyone deserves to have their needs met in a healthy relationship.** Jenny clearly stated to Nico, I want \"instant family\". Nico clearly peddled the idea that \"my family is exactly like that, 100%\". Reality is that it's not true, but Nico kept feeding the lies. Jenny has her issues and probably is the one that called for this mediation meeting since she was the one to invite OP and BF. \n\n\n\n>Not their problem\n\nThe problems were brother is a liar and not directly communicating their needs to Jenny, so both are their responsibilities.", "Okay but how?", "No, I get it. I recall reading some of OP's comments and thinking no one in that situation came off well.", "Okay", "Did you read them?", "An emotionally regulated adult realizes that the things they want to offer are not always the things that their companions wish to receive.  You stop giving your cousin books because you realize that you love books, but they don't.  You stop knitting hats for your husband because he hates hats.   And you stop chatting with your introverted in-law because you realize they like being alone.\n\nJenny's offers of closeness were intrusive (asking about OP's sex life) and Jenny refused to take \"no\" for an answer, ever after it had been said several times.", "[deleted]", "In OP's edits in the original post she said the gf would do things like ask to know about OP's sex life and when OP would say she didn't want to talk about it with her and steer the conversation elsewhere, she would just go back to it. Seems like OP's problem was that this sort of thing would happen all the time and became frustrating.\n\nI also grew up not knowing about boundaries or how to have healthy relationships with people, and this sort of thing was the hardest lesson to learn. I modeled how to interact with people based on TV shows and movies, and characters frequently do things that would make people in real life uncomfortable.\n\nYou have to give people space and respect their boundaries. People that have known each other their whole lives will open up more but if the gf didn't know them well and was pushing on subjects that she didn't know are uncomfortable, I can easily see how that strains a relationship that's still forming.\n\nGF needs lots of therapy, but her in laws aren't her therapists.", "He's absolutely an asshole for that and not realizing what a dumpster fire lying to everyone was, but the GF still needs therapy.\n\nShe's pushing on her trauma and needs she didn't get from her childhood on to people she barely knows. She's intertwining the happiness in relationship based on what other people think of her. She needs time to understand boundaries and coping mechanisms to interact with people without overstepping.\n\nIf she still needs a surrogate family to be happy, that's fine. That means this relationship isn't for her.

I never once suggested that I should be included in my MIL's mini-breaks with her three daughters.  I never asked to call my in-laws Mom and Dad.  When the funerals eventually  came, I left the choices to my husband and sisters-in-law.\n\nThe difference in motivation is that I had an excellent relationship with my own parents, so it was easier to accept that I was a beloved member of the in-law family, but not a daughter.  Jenny couldn't accept that, because she had no family of her own, and she'd been promised that she'd be a daughter.\n\nThere is a difference between loving and accepting an in-law and becoming their new parent.   If that happens -- and it's unusual -- it doesn't happen the moment the engagement is announced.", "I agree, she did a very bad job.

She needs help and she needs to tell Nico to kiss her ass.", "I agree with your assessment.", "Nico allowing Jenny to believe that you come as an instant bonus family was his fault alone, yes, and he should have addressed that assumption properly with her much sooner, regardless of the abandonment feelings it would trigger in her. Yes inviting herself to things etc shows poor boundaries, yes it's fair enough that it makes you uncomfortable, and no you're not obliged to love or trust her before those connections have been built over time.\n\nHe should have been honest that not only do some aspects of her behaviour show poor boundaries/disrespect on her part, but also that your family dynamics are actually overly boundaried, so the more she pushed to make connections, the more the family would push back. It kind of sounds like you reject Jenny in a similar way to how your stepfather rejected you at first. Like you're mad at her that she tries to make connections without working to earn approval, so you push back on her attempts more than people ordinarily would. Is it possible that that's how things work in your family? Based on you reprimanding your boyfriend for quite reasonably and calmly expressing how he felt in a perfectly appropriate context, it seems that way.\n\nA healthy response would have been clearly and kindly setting boundaries, talking to her directly about these issues even if it means some confrontation, rather than relegating it to your brother to attempt to manage her relationships with each of you. Pointedly rejecting and excluding her for no other reason than to reinforce your boundaries is not a good substitute for communication. That's something you should apologise to Jenny for. Ditto to your boyfriend- just because what he said made you uncomfortable doesn't mean he shouldn't have said it, and telling him off to try to force a behaviour change is a poor substitute for communicating without blame about how open communication makes you feel very vulnerable and reflecting on how you can work on that.\n\nI have to also disagree about the give/take thing. Jenny was taking, yes, but also generously giving- inviting people to spend time with her, offering her company and effort etc. She wasn't leeching, she just didn't know HOW to make these connections without trying to enforce them.\n\nIt's admittedly a bad fit with your family. She has poor boundaries, you have rigid ones. She gives love and trust freely and generously, you expect people to prove themselves worthy of it first. Her approach isn't healthy but neither is yours.", "I thought you were the AH then and was down voted to hell for saying pretty much... exactly what was going on.

He created those expectations and then left her out to dry. That feels manipulative and predatory. I hope Jenny walks away from this situation. It doesn't seem like it's going to be a healthy dynamic for her.", "I do feel bad for Nico since it seems like his relationship with Jenny is probably ruined, but you are right.\n\nWhy was he so willing to lie to everyone? What was the point of it all? If he really loved her, why not be honest with her from the start? It doesn't make sense to me. While Jenny is at fault here, Nico is too.

He knows his family and he knows Jenna. Once he found out that there was a disconnect, he should have sat everyone down and had conversations.

Its still mostly on the family you are joining to invite you when they feel comfortable, not on you to forcibly insert yourself.\n\nThe reason i said that nobody owes anyone a family (and triggered you, sorry about that) is because you just cant promise that stuff... you dont know if people will click or tolerate each-other. Youve been on this sub, youve seen how shitty some families can get and you shouldnt be forced into \"getting along\" with someone unconditionally just because they are your partner's family. Again, relationships are built, not promised.\n\nImo this entire story is just sad and happened because of a mismatch of expectations.

Like I get the irritation at the various lack of boundaries examples. But not all of them really were. Calling your in-laws Mom/Dad is pretty common, and it doesn't mean (at least initially) that you put them on an equal footing with your actual parents, if you have them, it's just an honoring-your-partner's-elders token. I get being a bit weirded out if it's not your custom (it wasn't mine and it took me a little while to get used to it in my husband's family), but given that it's not particularly socially abnormal, and that she came from such a vulnerable background, I think it was unnecessarily cruel of Nico's parents to ask her not to do it.", "And four idiots voted down on you", "I also think this is a big cultural thing, which is why there is such a divide on the sub (and the previous post).
