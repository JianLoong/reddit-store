In no small part to my extensive replies while sitting in an airport lounge on a layover \ud83d\ude02 I am still getting dms asking for an update so here goes. \n\nFirst, Thanks everyone for your advice, I received some really insightful messages and comments which were really helpful and heartfelt.\n\nLong story short we decided to have a session with a family mediator. It was me, my bf, Jenny, Nico, my parents, and Chelsea. I\u2019m not sure I can\u2019t fit in all the insights from the session so I\u2019ll keep to key things. \n\nFirstly, for all those wondering if Nico ever actually told Jenny what we said. Nico talked to Jenny about our concerns precisely twice, a third of the times we brought it up. She said it was presented to her as an offhand comment from our parents rather the intervention it was. \n\nSecond, Basically one of the main things that came up was how Nico kind of \u201csold\u201d our family to Jenny as a blended family she could slot into, and she got really invested in that. Nico said he kept hoping that it would all work itself out once Jenny felt more secure in their relationship. Then came the real crux. Jenny said she wasn\u2019t just looking for a relationship with Nico, but with a whole family. And we all had a long discussion about what that looked like for us in an ideal world, and it was vastly different. Then the mediator asked her the question \u201cif you never get the relationships you want from this family, do you think you\u2019ll still be able to have a happy relationship?\u201d And she said she didn\u2019t know. This kind of triggered Nico, who said he felt like Jenny was making him feel like he wasn\u2019t enough on his own, that she wanted a family from him more than a relationship with him. Then Jenny got upset and said why couldn\u2019t we all just try to be the family she needed. At which point my boyfriend had an uncharacteristic moment of insanity and went off on her, then he and I left the room. I was right in the middle of lecturing him when everyone else came out except Nico and Jenny and said that they need the rest of the session to discuss what had been said. \n\nNico came back to our parents\u2019 place later and said he and Jenny are \u201ctaking a beat\u201d because she\u2019s ruminating on what the mediator said and he\u2019s pretty crushed that she might not want to be with him if he doesn\u2019t come with a ready made family attached. He said he was prepared to pretty much give up a family for her, but she won\u2019t even give up the idea of one for him. He\u2019s now staying with my boyfriend and me until further notice. We haven\u2019t has any further conversations with him and Jenny, he\u2019s not in the headspace for it. If they stay together I foresee a lot more mediation. \n\nAt the end of the day, everyone on the thread was right in some way. I was an AH for saying what I said in the way I said it, and this conversation between all of us should have happened earlier.", "created_utc": 1693306284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164f4mz/update_aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 443, "replies": ["This is so bizarre, what your boyfriend told her in his \"insanity\" moment?", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mb8ih/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fianc%C3%A9_that_we_dont/)", "This is sad all around, Jenny's looking for the family she never had (while breaking a lot of boundaries yes) and your brother is never going to be enough for her without it, I hope they just stay in therapy and not get married anytime soon.", "I think that she has boundary issues bc she's likely never experienced normal, healthy relationships. \n\nEverything is all in or all out and she hasn't experienced loving someone generally even if you aren't close (as some siblings may be) or friendships that are like siblings and others that are activity-related etc. \n\nHer expectations are wholly unrealistic so of course she thinks anything less isn't real or she's being rejected or cheated out of the real deal.", "OP post\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/pB9WUiyin6", "So basically Nico promised her something that he couldn\u2019t outright give her and just hoped it would work out so that she\u2019d agree to marry him?

And he was willing to throw his family away knowing that that\u2019s not what she wants but he just assumes if they both have no family then it\u2019s fine? This all sounds like Nico\u2019s fault honestly. He lied to her because he wanted her to marry him. He lied to you all and hoped with enough time either the lie would become true or he\u2019d have to cut contact with you all to keep up his lies. Somehow he\u2019s the victim though? Your family is enabling his lying and manipulative behavior and treating Jenny like the villain for wanting what she\u2019d been promised.", "Thanks for the update, but honestly, I think your brother dodged a bullet.

Maybe he can be honest with his next partner instead of causing them unnecessary grief.\n\nWhat did your boyfriend say to her ?

Lies. \n\nHe yelled at his family for not being what he lied to her about, what he promised her they would be. \n\nThen he yelled at her for not being content enough with reality after his lies all crumbled.\n\nShe needs therapy, but he\u2019s the real AH here. \n\nOP, did I get any of that wrong?\n\nEDIT: in fact the more I think about this, the worse he comes off. She came to him in an incredibly vulnerable state, and he left her exponentially worse! And if his family doesn\u2019t hold him accountable for this, he will remember this incident not as something he caused, but some \u201ccrazy ex girlfriend\u201d story.", "I\u2019m confused as to why your boyfriend was invited to the family mediator when the issue is Jenny being too involved in family matters as someone not involved in the family. And hugely inappropriate for him to lose his shit during mediation - what did he say? You really breezed over that aspect which I think is important.\n\nI\u2019m not saying anyone owes Jenny a family and she obviously has boundary issues but it does kind of seem like one rule for her and another for everyone else.", "NTA. \nJenny is NTA.\n\nYour brother is the AH. \n\nIt sounds like Jenny was upfront about her expectations, and she was mislead by your brother. \n\nYou and your family are entitled to boundaries. You conveyed to your brother on multiple occasions that you were uncomfortable (as well as directly to Jenny), and he did nothing to resolve this, nor did he communicate with Jenny. \n\nI feel sad for Jenny, but your brother redirecting her issues to the responsibility of your family is unacceptable.", "Your brother IS TA for lying to Jenny and expecting the rest of the family to deliver on the relationships she wants.", "Taking away the moment on insanity comment, can any of the people calling OP an A H honestly say they walked into a relationship with a new SO and immediately became 'family' with theirs?  Family relationships take work, just like friendships do.  Jenny expected to immediately become a 'sister', but it seems she never respected boundaries , so everyone else was uncomfortable. Nico could have relayed the issues a lot earlier and a lot clearer, and it may not have gotten to this point.  It seems the mediation was needed, and hopefully, everyone can learn from it.", "I think Nico is the villain in this story. People are allowed to have whatever standards they want for a relationship - it can be really important to someone that their partner not drink, or that their friends like their partner, or that their partner is religious. Your SIL made it clear to Nico that her standard is that she wanted a family that would embrace her and include her in things independent of her attachment to him. Tall order? Sure. Should she go to therapy and work through how reasonable that standard is? Probably. But she went into the relationship communicating that expectation, and he essentially dangled that carrot to keep her in it, despite hearing from you all that you were not wanting to be that for her or have that relationship with her (which is fine too! That\u2019s also a standard you\u2019re allowed to have).", "I'm trying to get it straight with the people calling you and your family TA in this situation - you are a blended family and it is pretty much consensus on this sub that noone should be assuming a close familial relationship in a blended family unless such a relationship naturally develops (sauce: any post where a step mum asks to be called Mum, step-siblings not wanting to have a sibling-like relationship, on and on and on).\n\nBut here, people are kicking off because a not-even-married into the family adult woman is not immediately let in into the most intimate connections family members who have known each other for years/their whole lives have - what in the fuck?\n\nThis is nuts. I understand she has had a most traumatising childhood, but even in your original post there is mention of your childhood being imperfect and not having what \"everyone else has just by being born\" in terms of family warmth and stability. I'd like to counteract that with the argument that everyone on the family bonding spectrum has difficulties dealing with their family and complications around feeling loved and accepted for who they are, of course this is amped up to the n-th scale for Jenny but it is not for you or your family to bear the cross, if not for any other reason but because having to pretend to be intimately close to someone when the feelings are not there is extremely hurtful to both sides and you can't just tell your heart to open up - people who are suggesting that that's possible on here are unhinged. \n\nFrom reading your original post it seems like you and your family repeatedly tried to establish a respectful boundary that would allow a relationship to flourish, but Jenny seemed unequipped to take the hints. Sometimes we want things to be a certain way so badly (Jenny wanting to be considered close family) that no gentle nudges can set us off course.", "OP, agree with others here that your brother is the real AH.  He lead Jenny to think that you all would accept her as family.  I also agree with others about **your BF** being there in a **family** meeting.  Why was \"HE\" there?  He isn't family or does your family accept him as family?!  If he is accepted as family where his input matters, then isn't that hypocritical?", "INFO: why was your BF at the mediation session? We\u2019re any other partners or spouses there.\n\nEither way, I hardly blame Jenny. It\u2019s weird you aren\u2019t all taking Nico to task for lying his way into a relationship. Sounds like Nico is a manipulator but your family doesn\u2019t seem to have very healthy dynamics anyway. \n\nI hope Jenny finds someone who will treat her right and your brother learns a hard lesson about misleading people he wants to be in romantic partnerships with.", "There's nothing \"wrong\" with Jenny. She has life trauma around being abandoned and rejected, and I feel there are much kinder ways to handle this. Y'all act like some closed elite club that she doesn't qualify for. And Nico pretty much told her these expectations were realistic, so a lot of this misunderstanding lies with him. After realizing her expectations (that she had because he told her she could) were not realistic, she's now reflecting. I honestly don't see how she's the WHOLE problem here. You're vilifying her for wanting a family. Even the way you talk about her...\n\n>Nico came back to our parents\u2019 place later and said he and Jenny are \u201ctaking a beat\u201d because she\u2019s ruminating on what the mediator said and he\u2019s pretty crushed that she might not want to be with him if he doesn\u2019t come with a ready made family attached. \n\n...like she's some spoiled brat who expects the world to bend to her, when in reality, you come across to me like someone with very little empathy and no desire to develop any.", "Jenny needs to dump Nico and look for a compatible man with a loving family that will accept her.", "Honestly she\u2019s weird for requesting your bf to be there, your brother is the bigger AH. You, your parents and bf aren\u2019t AH\u2019s. Your bf basically just said what you were all\nThinking.", "Gosh I don't like you. Just really don't like anything about you. You make several whole posts about boundary stomping and yet you bring your big mouth bf to mediation where he proceeds to berate the only person without family present who was truthfully answering a question she was asked. What the hell is wrong with you.\n\nMaybe Jenny is annoying and needy, but your whole family was unkind and judgemental. According to you she had zero family, raised in foster care and when she asked if someone could throw her a bridal shower or be her MoH that was a boundary ... Are you all just that cold hearted? You couldn't meet her somewhere in the middle just to be kind to a person who got dealt such a rotten hand.\n\nI think her leaving your step brother is for the best. I hope Jenny meets someone nice with a kind family who seeing as she doesn't have anyone will go to the tiny effort required to throw her a bridal shower.", "Yikes to the whole situation. Nico made ridiculous promises to manipulate Jenny into marrying him and never told his family about his expectations, and in fact when Jenny started pushing their comfort level he pretended to be on his family's side and lied about talking to Jenny about their boundaries. Jenny apparently had no real interest in just marrying Nico for himself, was lied to about what to expect from her inlaws, and had no baseline experience for the way families/inlaws function in real life. The rest of the family had their boundaries trampled on and were made to feel like the bad guys when really Nico was the AH all along.", "YTA\n\nYour bf is TA\n\nYour family is TA\n\nThis is so sad all around", "Jenny has watched 'While You Were Sleeping' one too many times.       \nJust my take on it.         \nHope things work out for your brother.", "NTA. Wow. This woman needs serious therapy, and your brother should probably go his separate way. Chances are she may never see \"one person\" as enough. She's going to either keep driving your family crazy, or she's going to leap on the next guy who has a big, loving family. Either way, I can't see them having a happy relationship. \n\nYour brother should be more honest with the next woman, it would have saved everyone a lot of time and stress.", "Why the fuck are your bf involved in this?", "All I think about is playing the Sims. Jenny would cheat the relationship to be 100% best friends. Even in the game you slowly build relationships without cheating. She wants every relationship to be solid without acknowledging it takes time to build these relationships. And that\u2019s normal for someone who marrying into the family. I also think OP\u2019s brother clearly gave her unrealistic expectations. She\u2019s coming in very strong and that can be a turn off to others. People were telling her to slow down, but she couldn\u2019t quiet seem to get it. Jenny needs therapy on healthy relationships and boundaries.", "Thank you for the update!  It was such a nuanced situation.  Your family rocks!  Willing to do a mediation (and it sounds like you found a good mediator) and to be honest and put the time in.  It is so much better for the truth to be out there - even if Nico is hurt right now.  And so much kinder to Jenny in the long run.  My SIL married young to get away from her parents (rightly) and got a ready made family with her husband's family.  For 20 years.  But the marriage wasn't good and when they broke up - no surprise - she lost that family.  Better than Jenny learn now than to be two kids into it, for the wrong reasons, and then lose it all.", "Someone link the original post, please!", "Jenny is the only one in this whole multi-part story that has an excuse to behave the way they have. The rest of the characters just seem rotten.", "> Jenny said she wasn\u2019t just looking for a relationship with Nico, but with a whole family.\n\nNico really needed to hear this. Jenny isn't emotionally ready to have a committed romantic relationship. She needs to resolve her trauma instead of trying to recreate the childhood she wished she had.\n\nNico was willing to help prop her up by offering the crutch she was looking for even though he knew he couldn't follow through. He lied and banked on everyone magically conforming without anyone being on the same page.", "Read your previous post and honestly Jenny needs therapy bc she has some major things to work through. It sounds like she has attachment issues and your brother fed into that. Honestly it sounds like your brother put his needs of having a relationship before actually making sure Jenny was secure  in the relationship first. Then should have come the introduction and building a familial relationship.", "Had a kind of similar situation as the boyfriend once but not as bad.\n\nMy MIL and wife were arguing with my FIL over elder care and possible elder abuse allegations for an aunt from her husband and step kids. He was saying he probably couldn\u2019t legally do anything. He was dragging his feet on getting a lawyer to even find out. I got frustrated being on the side lines and basically yelled at him about getting a lawyer because he doesn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\n\nNever seen a more \u201cdeer in the headlights\u201d look. Then he agreed to getting a lawyer. My wife said they almost yelled at me for yelling at their father but then it clicked what I said. Said that the only reason it even worked is because I never raise my voice ever and that alone was a shock. If anyone gets me to yell then they need to take a step back because maybe they\u2019re fucking up.\n\nOP said it was an \u201cuncharacteristic moment of insanity\u201d which suggests he\u2019s usually cool calm and collected. Probably should have been a red flag for her if someone she considered to be like that is blowing up then why isn\u2019t she when she\u2019s closer to the situation.", "Thanks.", "I hope he finds someone else. This girl comes with a lot of baggage and he is too young to need to deal with all that. Better a clean cut", "Completely agree. We can't gloss over how shitty Nico is in all this. He KNEW what she wanted and that is why he lied and misled everyone about the dynamic. For him to suddenly act like Jenny's very clearly stated wants are brand new information is extremely sketchy.   \n\n\nNotice how he is maneuvering himself to be a victim as the truth comes out? How he is the one who is hurt by...the expectation he created and perpetuated for his girlfriend regarding family? Interesting, isn't it?", "Yeah Nico didn't talk to her, or just kind of made the \"throw away comment\" to soften it, because he didn't WANT to tell her that her ready made family wasn't happening. He wanted to keep deceiving her into a marriage. He was willing to have a marriage based on a deception, but is now mad at HER. That's messed up.", "Yeah the attitude here is \u201cnobody owes you a family\u201d. Um, yeah, if that\u2019s what they promise you!", "But what reasonable person would take that as a given? Most people know relationships take time to develop but at least knowing they are a welcoming bunch.", "What I find odd is that he seemingly didn\u2019t let others know about expectations so they could have chosen for themselves and give gf pointers about family life", "BF has become close to the family because he's been there for a few years and had time to build a relationship. He probably hasn't said anything because he has no place in the situation. However, he's been watching everything from the sidelines and knows a lot of details since he's OPs BF. It sounds like the situation was so idiotic that he understandably snapped.\n\nIf you really boil it down it's:\n\nJenny: I want a family and am disregarding everyone else's wants for my own desires. I will hear no argument about it and am consciously choosing to dismiss the concerns of others.\n\nOP: But we don't know you well enough to be your family. We need time to create a relationship. It can't happen instantly.\n\nJenny: I want a family. I want it to happen instantly.\n\nThe way the post is worded makes it seem like the dialogue cycled between OP and her family asking for space and Jenny repeating something along the lines of that she didn't care about what other people wanted. Jenny refused to compromise but the family continued the conversation to try and convince her. This led to what happens when you try and argue with a toddler. The conversation will never end because the toddler isn't old enough to have the mental capacity to regulate what it wants and understand what that means. Like, it wants to touch the stove even if it's hot.\n\nBFs moment of insanity was probably the only thing that would've ended the conversation. Jenny doesn't want to face reality. OP needs to learn that they can't place expectations on Jenny because Jenny doesn't act like a reasonable person.", "He was invited because Jenny asked for him and Chelsea\u2019s boyfriend Ollie to be there. Ollie couldn\u2019t make it. \n\nHe basically said that Jenny has been very quick to tell everyone what she needs from them without stopping to think that she might also have to give something back, and that people don\u2019t exist to be what or who she needs them to be at any given time. He didn\u2019t yell or anything, but really I\u2019d have preferred if he\u2019d not said anything at all, even though he wasn\u2019t technically wrong in my opinion", "All of that is on the neither for lying to her. That's not OP, her family, or Jenny's fault. He brought this on.", "Per the original post, OP was uncomfortable with discussing her sex life and medications with Jenny, which are totally normal boundaries to have. Additionally OP's parents had to tell Jenny on multiple seperate occasions that they weren't comfortable with her calling them Mom and Dad. The family wasn't being needlessly cruel or excluding Jenny from events, they were just being reasonable people with healthy boundaries", "Because Jenny asked for him to be there", "I disagree; I don\u2019t feel like OP\u2019s family is acting elite. I would be uncomfortable if my sibling\u2019s BF/GF jumped in and expected an immediate intimate relationship (on level with asking sex questions like OP said), too. Relationships take time to develop, whether they be romantic, friendly, or familial. And OP and the family cared enough to try and resolve this with a family mediator - that is going beyond normal effort in my estimation.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: while Nico was 100% wrong in what he told Jenny, she is definitely giving the impression that he\u2019s just a means to the end of gaining the family she always wanted. If she doesn\u2019t love him on his own, family or no, then her intentions aren\u2019t wholly pure, either.", "Yeah some of the wording of this makes me feel gross.

No wonder she thinks she can behave this way. No one has clearly told her otherwise.\n\nI expect that she will break up with your brother so it\u2019s probably not a problem. He unfairly was dishonest  to her from the beginning. Your brother is the one that needs a lecture.", "I didn't say the red flag was his. I meant that its a red flag on you. He didn't yell, ok, but he inserted himself fully into something he normally stays out of. If he saw something and felt so strongly about something that he does something out of the norm, I don't know how you don't take a step back and wonder if ***you're*** the one acting acting with inappropriately here. Maybe you should be more invested or react more strongly than you have been.", "He said they would be welcoming her with open arms, and they did. But she inserted herself in matters that had nothing to with her (like op's mom and sister having a small fight) over and over. They welcomed her but after seeing how she is, they grew tired of her breaking boundaries over and over and over again.", "He talked about his welcoming his family are. Jenny latched onto that then fantasised it all and reality kicked in when living people didn\u2019t behave hiw Jenny wanted. \n\nPoor girl needs therapy bc she\u2019s in relationships to find a family. The fact OP brother is a means to an end is sad.", "Wilful ignorance and hoping it will sort itself out no matter what- and then realising that it is basically a runaway train", "Just by the brother. The rest of the family had no idea bro was promising Jenny immediate integration into their existing family and thought he was passing on their concerns every time they talked about establishing boundaries", "Could you elaborate on this? Is someone not allowed to snap under pressure after seeing their significant other continue to go through an extremely emotional and volatile situation where the person starting the argument isn't mentally healthy and will continue the argument to get what they want? If your significant other was clearly being mistreated by their siblings fiance, would you not say anything? If you saw the situation wasn't going to be resolved while your significant other was under emotional stress, would you not be allowed to be angry about it?", "Family doesn't mean \"people you never say no to\" or \"seemless part of your life with no boundaries.\" \n\nThe problem is Jenny doesn't know how family relationships actually work,so she's trying to force a hallmark movie inseparable relationship with ppl  she barely knows", "And it sounds like your culture chooses that decision, it doesn't make it obligated. \n\nI've read the post, the brother lied to Jenny and that's on him, not OP or her family or Jenny. OPs family is slower to get to know people and that's their prerogative how they choose to do it. The brother is the real instigator behind all this for promising Jenny relationships he hasn't deliver.", "And instead of losing it on Jenny, their ire should be on the BF their family member", "OP, her boyfriend and their families reaction is entirely on them", "How did he lie? His family did welcome her. They did with stepdad and OP bf. But it takes time to have string connections. The issue is he underestimated how literal Jenny would take it in terms of her expecting she\u2019d have strong connection with her instantly.", "OP says in her comments Jenny asked for her bf to be included\n\nEdit \n\n> He was invited because Jenny asked for him and Chelsea\u2019s boyfriend Ollie to be there. Ollie couldn\u2019t make it.", "Maybe they got to know the boyfriend gradually over time in the way that one usually gets to know people, whereas Jenny started asking people about their sex lives and medical issues shortly after meeting them.", "I think if 1 shoe fits that Jenny isn't family because she's the brothers fianc\u00e9e then it needs to fit for all the partners no wonder the poor woman is confused she sees her BFs siblings partners being treated like family one can imagine what he told her", "Because he was needlessly exacerbating the situation. What he said was true but it helped absolutely no one for it to be said. \n\nI brought him there at Jenny\u2019s request, and he said in advance he wasn\u2019t going to say anything inflammatory because he\u2019s only peripherally involved. For him to snap like that was massively unhelpful. Jenny started crying, the whole thing turned chaotic after that.", "Totally...what place does he have to be in the \"family\" mediation if the whole mediation is about keeping significant others OUT of the family? Jenny was a fiance. He's just a boyfriend. How has he earned such a great place of honor?", "Because him snapping at her helped no one. We had all got to a place where we were calm after a lot of heavy talking in the session and then he said what he said and Jenny burst into tears and it turned chaotic again. What he said he had no bearing on the outcome of the session, it just caused drama.\n\nI support the sentiment, he knows that. But he shouldn\u2019t have said it right then.", "Mhm. And of course he gets to run away from the mess he made to mommy and daddy and Jenny is the villain in their books.", "Oh, sure, I suppose that\u2019s allowed. \n\nI, personally, would prefer that he act like an adult and not go insane in a therapy session. \n\nNot sure his age was mentioned in the original post, so maybe that\u2019s a bit much to be asking for", ">Family doesn't mean \"people you never say no to\" or \"seemless part of your life with no boundaries.\" \n\nAnd where did I say that ? \n\nNo, the problem is the girl was literally deceived. Do you not understand that you shouldn't be promising something to someone if it's not true ? She has issues that's the kind of thing that happens to someone who doesn't have a family, you know what you shouldn't do to these people lie to them and humiliate them.", "I don't think OP's family is necessarily slower to get to know people. It seems like they definitely welcomed her and tried to form a relationship, but she immediately wanted to be on equal footing with everyone and have them consider her exactly the same as a real sister/daughter. She'd only been with Nico for two years and most likely didn't meet his family immediately. Yet it seems like she started calling his parents mom and dad incredibly quickly since she'd already been told not to do that multiple times. She also inserted herself into family arguments, which really isn't something you should do even if you've been married and part of the family for years. \n\nAll that said, I do really feel bad for her and don't necessarily think her actions were her fault. As you said, Nico deserves the blame for telling her that she'd immediately be accepted just like a real family member so that's how she acted. I doubt she'd have acted the same way if he hadn't said what he did. \n\nStill, I feel like she could probably use some therapy since going into a relationship with the main goal of getting a family seems extremely unhealthy. People obviously get married to start their own family, but that's definitely not the same as what she's doing.", "From reading the original post and OPs comments their the other partners were included gradually as bonds form naturally overtime the GF was trying to force it overnight", "In addition, they've known OP's boyfriend longer than they've known Jenny.", "Surely the point of mediation is for everyone to speak their mind willingly? Why would he even be there if he didn't get to voice his issues? He may as well have stayed out of it if that's what you wanted", "His statement might not have seemed helpful in the moment but sounds like it needed to be said. Jenny was only focusing on everyone being the family she needed.", "If your boyfriend was not invited to speak at the mediation, then why was he there at all? What he said was not insanity, it was a crucial observation by sometime involved in this mess. \n\n\"Because he was needlessly exacerbating the situation. What he said was true but it helped absolutely no one for it to be said\" why go to the mediation if you're not going to bring up the problem? Jenny kept on about what she needs to the detriment of your whole family's needs. Your boyfriend didn't need a lecture. What he said was honest, not unkind, and it's not harsh. It boiled the problem down to it's base.", "I mean at what point does this end? Clearly Jenny is never really going to be a part of your family as everyone views her as some annoying gadfly so why doesn\u2019t everyone just move on at some point?  How much longer must this ridiculous farce continue ?", "Ok so you dragged him there to be a potted plant where he\u2019s not allowed to talk?\n\nAbove you say he was \u201cvery calm and collected in his response\u201d but yet now you\u2019re saying he \u201csnapped like that\u201d to the point where you took him out of the room to lecture him? Which is it? \n\nYou really need to take a big, big step back from your brother\u2019s relationship drama and stop being such asshole to your own BF. \n\nThe poor fucker is getting dragged around to family mediation sessions for your family and getting dragged out into the hall to get scolded if he speaks out of turn. Man, I hope he finds someone better.", "So you invited him to an open forum of communication but punished him for speaking out? Shame on you, you need to fix that.", "It's a mediation session with a counsellor, and this is its purpose - to get the truth out in the open so that you can all communicate. \n\nIt absolutely needed to be said, and he doesn't seem to have said it with harmful intent. If she started crying, then it's because the way he said it finally registered with her in a way that none of the rest of you could.", "Jenny asked for him to be there.", "If he wasn\u2019t allowed to speak then why did you invite him?!", "But I\u2019m confused bc the way you write it he was responding to Jenny crying and going on about why couldn\u2019t you all be who she expects you to be. It deserved a response and given he was invited to the session, he\u2019s allowed to respond. He didn\u2019t yell. It was a fair response to Jenny. Your bf didn\u2019t deserve to get told off for speaking his mind. The drama was already there with Jenny\u2019s unreasonable expectations", "No you\u2019re right OP. Your bf might be right, but that\u2019s really a conversation for Jenny to have with a therapist.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he had some crazy outburst. It more sounded like OP was saying he snapped at Jenny and then the insanity/chaos erupted. It sounds like a really frustrating situation and is not at all inappropriate to voice that, especially when there\u2019s a mediator there. The convo was seemingly going in circles, I think a lot of people would lose it after awhile.", "Where does this say this was a therapy session?", "> she literally made it clear from the beginning that was what she was looking for\n\nShe DID NOT make it clear. She didn't make it clear to the OP and the OP NEVER AGREED. This was PURELY between Nico and Jenny. And even then, she clearly didn't make it clear to Nico just how important this was to her. She had to wait until they had an intervention before she finally admitted their relationship is possibly not worth having if she can't have the family she wants from him. She CLEARLY did not make anything clear to anyone until this intervention.\n\nThere was NO agreement or expectation set between Jenny and the rest of the family who she was demanding a close relationship from.\n\nIt takes 2 to have a relationship, and it seems Jenny was all in, but no one else was.\n\n> In my culture anyone who marries into the family is family and they get invited to events with the women or men to get closer with each other\n\nOkay that's YOUR culture. Who the duck are you to say this isn't right because of your culture? Also, THEY'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED. Just engaged! So by your logic, she shouldn't even be invited to things yet.\n\nAnd did you read the original post? She's not saying they're not family or that she doesn't WANT her to be family. She's saying that the type of relationship Jenny wants takes time, whereas Jenny wants it NOW. And in the update, Jenny even DEMANDED the family be EXACTLY what she expected (which is ABSOLUTELY absurd). You can't DEMAND someone love you and demand them to treat you a certain way. This takes time and even then, there can never be a guarantee that they will love you the way you want.\n\n\n> She has issues that's the kind of thing that happens to someone who doesn't have a family,\n\nThis doesn't excuse her behavior. This only explains it. And this is why she needs therapy, not a whole fake family.\n\n> you know what you shouldn't do to these people lie to them and humiliate them.\n\nI do agree that Nico is at fault for not setting expectations more clearly. But this is not OPs fault. She didn't know the extent of the issue and she assumed Nico had dealt with it, which he did not. But again, OP did not lie to her. And OP even admits she should have worded what she said differently.", "I can't fault her for that though since her BF lied to her from the get-go", "Which is why I don\u2019t think Nico lied. They do welcome newbies but through time and getting to know each other. The original post Op says I\u2019m comments they did welcome her. The issue is Jenny lacks the social skills to read the room and was very clingy and wanting everyone to behave like fictional characters instead of real life people. I feel for her, she craves love and acceptance.", "fr, to me gf sounds like every shitty stepmom on this sub who\u2019s all pissy the kids won\u2019t call her mom.", "Because she said jenny asked for him to be there lmao", "Ya, I agree here. I realize that what he said was 'upsetting' but it kinda seems like the perfect place for that kind of honesty. And to be completely honest, I think this boils down to Jenny not really knowing that there is no 'normal' family to fit into, anywhere, ever. We all make our families over time, even the ones we're born into. Some sibling/parents have very close relationships, some don't. Some talk about sex, some don't. Etc. \nI know when I was with my partner's family for the first couple of years I just couldn't believe the stability and 'normalness' I saw and just loved it! But I learned in time that it isn't the hallmark family I thought, which is great, cuz that kind of family doesn't exist. All family is more complicated than that. Hopefully Jenny will get there, like I did cuz real is better when functioning in reality, and not-real just wastes our time and gets our hopes up when we could be enjoying the rich intricacies of life and relationships as they are.", "First all calm your fucking ass down and learn  how to read I'm gonna make it easier for you since you're too slow for that :\n\n\n1- Nico literally lied to her about the blended family that she can lash on to meaning he knew she was looking for that from the beginning and this is why he lied to get in a relationship with her.\n\n2- I said in my culture meaning for ME and people from the same culture and I was responding to someone who made it look like theirs is a universal thing. The point that I was making is not everyone is the same and there are families who could immediately accept Jenny as their own (which op's family don't work like that and it's fine ) once she marries or even gets engaged to one of theirs.  So next time read before you open your trap.\n\n3-me saying that Jenny has issues was not excusing her behaviour but emphasising that this something she struggles with and lying to her and deceiving her was not the way to go\n\n4- again are illiterate? When did I say op was in the wrong ? When did I say they owed her shit ? The only people I talked about was Nico and the bf (for lashing at her ) so how is that blaming op ?\n\nI never mentioned op or her last post or how her family wasn't comfortable with Jenny and never said they owed her anything either, I only trash talked the brother and bf so what is your fucking point ? Almost all of what you said is gobshit.", "Very true! It\u2019s sad she might never get the close family dynamic she wants but hopefully some good perspective will come from this for all involved", "Her boyfriend lied to her from the get go", "Feel like that makes his poignant statement even more meaningful in this situation. Poor bf, hope op apologizes.", "LMAO you need to calm the fuck down. I'm matching your aggression from your og comment and you just keep escalating.\n\n> 1- Nico literally lied to her about the blended family that she can lash on to meaning he knew she was looking for that from the beginning and this is why he lied to get in a relationship with her.\n\nOh look. Why don't I help you read what I wrote:\n\n> I do agree that Nico is at fault for not setting expectations more clearly.\n> And even then, she clearly didn't make it clear to Nico just how important this was to her. She had to wait until they had an intervention before she finally admitted their relationship is possibly not worth having if she can't have the family she wants from him.\n\nAnd it sounds like HE was blindsided by HER expectations of what she wanted from his family.\n\n> So next time read before you open your trap.\n\nSo do you read your own stuff and follow your own advice? No? \n\nI shouldn't even bother because there's no point engaging with someone that clearly has anger management issues.\n\n> When did I say op was in the wrong ? When did I say they owed her shit ? The only people I talked about was Nico and the bf (for lashing at her ) so how is that blaming op ?\n\n> What the fuck is wrong with this family, she wouldn't have gotten herself with y'all if she knew she wasn't as welcome as she expected.\n\nMan maybe I do know how to read after all! I should put that on my resume", "I think the GF can be a little less pushy and the OP, their family and their partners can be a little be more empathic/sympathic.", "No literally. Requesting her bf to be there already shows that Jenny is a bit of the AH as well."]}
