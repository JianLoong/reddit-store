In no small part to my extensive replies while sitting in an airport lounge on a layover \ud83d\ude02 I am still getting dms asking for an update so here goes. \n\nFirst, Thanks everyone for your advice, I received some really insightful messages and comments which were really helpful and heartfelt.\n\nLong story short we decided to have a session with a family mediator. It was me, my bf, Jenny, Nico, my parents, and Chelsea. I\u2019m not sure I can\u2019t fit in all the insights from the session so I\u2019ll keep to key things. \n\nFirstly, for all those wondering if Nico ever actually told Jenny what we said. Nico talked to Jenny about our concerns precisely twice, a third of the times we brought it up. She said it was presented to her as an offhand comment from our parents rather the intervention it was. \n\nSecond, Basically one of the main things that came up was how Nico kind of \u201csold\u201d our family to Jenny as a blended family she could slot into, and she got really invested in that. Nico said he kept hoping that it would all work itself out once Jenny felt more secure in their relationship. Then came the real crux. Jenny said she wasn\u2019t just looking for a relationship with Nico, but with a whole family. And we all had a long discussion about what that looked like for us in an ideal world, and it was vastly different. Then the mediator asked her the question \u201cif you never get the relationships you want from this family, do you think you\u2019ll still be able to have a happy relationship?\u201d And she said she didn\u2019t know. This kind of triggered Nico, who said he felt like Jenny was making him feel like he wasn\u2019t enough on his own, that she wanted a family from him more than a relationship with him. Then Jenny got upset and said why couldn\u2019t we all just try to be the family she needed. At which point my boyfriend had an uncharacteristic moment of insanity and went off on her, then he and I left the room. I was right in the middle of lecturing him when everyone else came out except Nico and Jenny and said that they need the rest of the session to discuss what had been said. \n\nNico came back to our parents\u2019 place later and said he and Jenny are \u201ctaking a beat\u201d because she\u2019s ruminating on what the mediator said and he\u2019s pretty crushed that she might not want to be with him if he doesn\u2019t come with a ready made family attached. He said he was prepared to pretty much give up a family for her, but she won\u2019t even give up the idea of one for him. He\u2019s now staying with my boyfriend and me until further notice. We haven\u2019t has any further conversations with him and Jenny, he\u2019s not in the headspace for it. If they stay together I foresee a lot more mediation. \n\nAt the end of the day, everyone on the thread was right in some way. I was an AH for saying what I said in the way I said it, and this conversation between all of us should have happened earlier.", "created_utc": 1693306284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164f4mz/update_aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 119, "replies": ["This is so bizarre, what your boyfriend told her in his \"insanity\" moment?", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mb8ih/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fianc%C3%A9_that_we_dont/)", "This is sad all around, Jenny's looking for the family she never had (while breaking a lot of boundaries yes) and your brother is never going to be enough for her without it, I hope they just stay in therapy and not get married anytime soon.", "I think that she has boundary issues bc she's likely never experienced normal, healthy relationships. \n\nEverything is all in or all out and she hasn't experienced loving someone generally even if you aren't close (as some siblings may be) or friendships that are like siblings and others that are activity-related etc. \n\nHer expectations are wholly unrealistic so of course she thinks anything less isn't real or she's being rejected or cheated out of the real deal.", "OP post\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/pB9WUiyin6", "So basically Nico promised her something that he couldn\u2019t outright give her and just hoped it would work out so that she\u2019d agree to marry him? And he\u2019s hurt that she can\u2019t accept that what she was told isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually happening at this point in time. And he was willing to throw his family away knowing that that\u2019s not what she wants but he just assumes if they both have no family then it\u2019s fine? This all sounds like Nico\u2019s fault honestly.", "Thanks for the update, but honestly, I think your brother dodged a bullet. I cringe to think what life will look like if they have kids together if she\u2019s already this obsessed with being part of your family. \ud83d\ude2c", ">He said he was prepared to pretty much give up a family for her, but she won\u2019t even give up the idea of one for him.\n\nShe never had one and she made it clear from the beginning that she wanted to be able to fit in with the family, he decided to lie and let it \"work by itself \" and now he's crying because his stupid plan didn't go as expected ? Maybe he can be honest with his next partner instead of causing them unnecessary grief.\n\nWhat did your boyfriend say to her ? What the fuck is wrong with this family, she wouldn't have gotten herself with y'all if she knew she wasn't as welcome as she expected. That poor girl she doesn't have a family and then got tricked into a relationship and humiliated.", "Ur poor bro :\u2019(", ">uncharacteristic moment of insanity\u2026\n\nWhat the hell?", "Yeah I want to know too", "Brother did dodge a bullet he\u2019s the one who loaded and passed her the weapon essentially. He lied to her about what the family was like and led her to believe a lie and didn\u2019t tell anyone because he hoped it would just work out. He\u2019s an ass for that.", "Have you even read the original post? Nobody owes anyone a family (besides your partner being your new family) and she was inserting herself everywhere. They will work this out with therapy", "Everyone is blaming the GF but yeah no OP and their family are effed up including their partners, if the brothers GF isn't part of the family and never will be why include the BF? What the hell did the BF say to her.", "Reply to my comment so i can come back, stranger? \ud83e\udd72", "Have you read this post ? She inserted herself because the brother told her that this was a blended family and she would be more than welcome and she literally made it clear from the beginning that was what she was looking for.\n\nAlso \n\n>Nobody owes anyone a family (besides your partner being your new family)\n\nWho the fuck are you to say that ? You know not everyone comes from the same culture as you ? In my culture anyone who marries into the family is family and they get invited to events with the women or men to get closer with each other.", "Exactlyyyy they are blaming that poor girl when she was literally promised something that wasn't real just because the brother wanted to date her ? And why is the BF who is literally an outsider lashing at her and getting involved.", "Hello! Have a reply!", "I'm wondering why are the other siblings partners included in the family but effort can't be had for the GF, reading stuffs like this is why I've vowed to open to my childrens partners no matter my feelings."]}
