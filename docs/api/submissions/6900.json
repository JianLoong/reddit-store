{"id": 6900, "submission_id": "107gjur", "title": "AITA for telling my gf she's \"not Korean enough?\"", "selftext": " This is a throwaway for anonymity.\n\nI'm 23M and white. My gf (ex gf, but I'll call her my gf for clarity) is 23 and mostly white, but she's 1/4 Korean.\n\nShe isn't connected to Korean culture, and she looks white - her face doesn't look Asian at all. I didn't know she was partly Asian until I saw her mom and siblings.\n\nRecently, she's been trying to 'reconnect' more with Korean-ness. A few months ago, her Korean uncle introduced her to some Asian food and history, and even taught her to read the Korean alphabet, and since then, she's been 'reconnecting.'\n\nNow our house is full of kimchi and gochujang, and she's learning to cook Asian food. She tried to make me eat it, but I hate spicy food, and I told her when she felt like cooking something new, I would just make my own food or order it. She was disappointed but agreed.\n\nBut that wasn't enough, because every time she cooks, it makes the whole apartment stink.\n\nSo one day, she made kimchi soup, and it made the apartment stink like fish and rotted cabbage. I got upset and told her I was sick of her stinking up the apartment. I told her that I thought kimchi was gross (it has bacteria in it), and it's weird she's eating this stuff, and I was sick of washing her rice and getting my own food. I figured she'd experiment for a while, get bored, and go back to eating like normal.\n\nShe got all serious and said that I was being 'culturally insensitive' by scorning Korean culture. She didn't say 'racist,' but she inferred it. But she said she was upset, and she thought I'd be happy that she was 'reconnecting with her culture.' She said it was making her happy, and it made her feel closer to her Korean grandfather, who died before she was born, and she never got a chance to meet, as well as her Korean uncle that I mentioned earlier. She said she felt like I was taking away something that made her really happy, and that I've done this before.\n\nI said it's not culturally insensitive to not want to smell like spicy fish, and she had no right to say I was culturally insensitive because she's not Korean enough - she's basically white. She's never been to Korea, doesn't speak Korean, doesn't look Korean - no one would look at her and know she was anything but white. I told her she's no better than just a white girl trying to act special, and by her logic, I could accuse her of cultural appropriation. She teared up and went on this big rant about how she knew she wasn't fully Korean and wasn't raised with the culture, but she's reconnecting, but she wanted to be closer to her family's culture (which doesn't even make sense, because her uncle is like the only fully Korean person in her family who's still alive), and I have no right to try to take away her joy.\n\nWe broke up a week later for unrelated reasons, but my friends found out about the situation, and some of them have been telling me that I was being an insensitive jerk.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1673276578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107gjur/aita_for_telling_my_gf_shes_not_korean_enough/", "score": 214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My gf (ex gf, but I'll call her my gf for clarity) is 23 and mostly white, but she's 1/4 Korean.\n\nShe isn't connected to Korean culture, and she looks white - her face doesn't look Asian at all. I didn't know she was partly Asian until I saw her mom and siblings.\n\nRecently, she's been trying to 'reconnect' more with Korean-ness. A few months ago, her Korean uncle introduced her to some Asian food and history, and even taught her to read the Korean alphabet, and since then, she's been 'reconnecting.'\n\nNow our house is full of kimchi and gochujang, and she's learning to cook Asian food. She tried to make me eat it, but I hate spicy food, and I told her when she felt like cooking something new, I would just make my own food or order it. She was disappointed but agreed.\n\nBut that wasn't enough, because every time she cooks, it makes the whole apartment stink.\n\nSo one day, she made kimchi soup, and it made the apartment stink like fish and rotted cabbage. I got upset and told her I was sick of her stinking up the apartment. I told her that I thought kimchi was gross (it has bacteria in it), and it's weird she's eating this stuff, and I was sick of washing her rice and getting my own food. I figured she'd experiment for a while, get bored, and go back to eating like normal.\n\nShe got all serious and said that I was being 'culturally insensitive' by scorning Korean culture. She didn't say 'racist,' but she inferred it. But she said she was upset, and she thought I'd be happy that she was 'reconnecting with her culture.' She said it was making her happy, and it made her feel closer to her Korean grandfather, who died before she was born, and she never got a chance to meet, as well as her Korean uncle that I mentioned earlier. She said she felt like I was taking away something that made her really happy, and that I've done this before.\n\nI said it's not culturally insensitive to not want to smell like spicy fish, and she had no right to say I was culturally insensitive because she's not Korean enough - she's basically white. She's never been to Korea, doesn't speak Korean, doesn't look Korean - no one would look at her and know she was anything but white. I told her she's no better than just a white girl trying to act special, and by her logic, I could accuse her of cultural appropriation. She teared up and went on this big rant about how she knew she wasn't fully Korean and wasn't raised with the culture, but she's reconnecting, but she wanted to be closer to her family's culture (which doesn't even make sense, because her uncle is like the only fully Korean person in her family who's still alive), and I have no right to try to take away her joy.\n\nWe broke up a week later for unrelated reasons, but my friends found out about the situation, and some of them have been telling me that I was being an insensitive jerk.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Europeans don't understand this as much because why on earth would you feel the need to question a family that's been there for generations. However, if you notice, European immigrants still define themselves by their heritage. Do you question a second generation British person calling themselves Indian still or keeping their old cultural norms alive? Typically it seems not. The hang up Europeans have seem to be white people doing it in America without understanding that white American families are still largely fairly recent immigrants in America or have parts of theor families that are. There's a lot that can be unpacked there that's honestly not a great look, but as more European media makes its way into the US, it's also becoming very apparent that Europeans do not question non white European families staying connected to old cultures but judge white Americans for doing the same. There's both a lack of understanding that America has actually developed its own practices and a kinda racist undertone there.\n\nGerman is also an interesting choice as an example because German immigrants were fairly insular to the point that over 400 newspapers were published exclusively  in German until WW1 in the US.
