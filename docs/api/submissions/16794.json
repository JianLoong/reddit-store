For the most part things like vacations and where we bought a house are decided based on what she can afford, but there have been several times I've paid in full for vacations to places I really enjoy and wanted to share the experience with her.\n\nShe has a 23y/o son from her previous marriage. When she and I got together I told her I wouldn't mind paying extra for things here and there until her son was 18 and working or in school so she could take care of him. For the majority of our relationship, he has lived with his father. He decided against college or trade school and hasn't expressed any interest in starting to figure out a plan for the immediate future let alone his life. He floats from job to job, and his father is pretty much the same since the kid graduated. Therein lies the problem: every few months they'll call her for a few hundred dollars here, a few hundred there, 20 bucks this week, 80 the next. Sometimes it's her son calling for help, sometimes it's her ex-husband. This has caused her to be short on funds for our plans, or things she volunteered to cover on more than one occasion. Her reasoning when its her ex asking is that since their son still lives with him, she has to help him. I get that to a point.\n\nWe were supposed to go on a vacation later this month. Nothing major or fancy but just time away. We had agreed to split the cost and all that was left to pay for were the hotels, rental car, and some reservations. Her ex-husband called needing help getting his car out of impound and getting caught up on rent. Their son hasn't been able to get to work without the car because he doesn't want to ride a bike or take a bus. Almost 5 grand later they're set up but my wife told me she can't pay for her portion of our vacation, so I told her I was canceling it. She called me a heartless ass, that she's just taking care of her son and we've been arguing over it but my stance is this: they're both able-bodied adults that keep making a series of life decisions that keep them at a stand still (like quitting jobs over little things, smoking, going out) and her always digging them out of their hole is starting to impact our lives more and more, and I didn't sign up for that. AITA for canceling our vacation instead of just footing the entire cost myself?\n\n\\*\\*\\*To clarify: She contributes 30% of her pay to our joint expenses: bills/utilities, emergency fund, retirement. 70% of her pay she keeps for her personal expenses and to spend or save how she wishes.

You don't seem to approve, but you also seem to accept it's her decision. She has a history of prioritizing her son as she should, but also she seems to be enabling her ex and son with her decision making. I don't think you are an AH for not wanting to supplement her ex/son with your income, which is exactly what would be happening if you continued to pay for the vacation with only your money. I don't see anything wrong with what you did, but I also see why others would not agree. It sounds like you had an agreement the vacation was to be split cost, and your wife tried to flip on that.", "You're NTA and you should have a discussion with finances with your wife. Why is she still giving money to her ex-husband?  \nShe shouldn't be giving money to her son either and she should be encouraging him to find a stable job or learn something that can get him a decent job.", "NTA\n\nLike you said, they're both able bodied adults who can provide for themselves but they see a free ride in your wife. My spouse would be LIVID if I was supporting my ex!", "NTA. Your wife needs to turn off the flow of financial support.

It appears she will continue to do this unless she's shown real-world consequences.", "NTA. You both made an agreement and your wife made her choice.", "NTA. she is wrong thinking she can give away her money and then be suported by you. they are all adults and are not sick", "NTA At all. You're correct. This is starting to impact your lives more and more. You are under no obligation to subsidize their lifestyle. And if your wife doesn't see that by giving them money then expecting you to pay for things that she is supposed to is subsidizing them, she's being willfully obtuse.", "There is no right answer to a problem with no solution.

It is clear that the two of them are just using your wife as an easy way-out since she's so lenient in giving out her money for them. And if you're also as lenient to your wife, no matter how awful that might sound to some people, that's the same as you paying her son and ex-husband; because your money goes to her and her money goes to them.\n\nYour wife should stop giving an easy way out to them and instead letting them be the responsible adult (at least for themselves) as they should.", "NTA. She has crossed the line from \"helping her son\" and is well into \"enabling her son AND her ex.\" You're right that they're both able-bodied adults and they're both CHOOSING to be lazy because they know your ex will give them whatever they ask for; son *could* have continued working but didn't because he didn't want to ride a bus - that is a choice, not a need. \n\nHonestly you should spend the time you would have been on vacation talking with your wife about learning the difference between helping and enabling; if she wants her son to live a full adult life, she has to accept that continuing to bail him out of unpleasant situations will hold him back.", "NTA. It would be different if your wife spent the money on her minor son (her son is a 23 y.o. adult) or a medical emergency, or any kind of emergency for her, you or her son. But it wasn't.

I don't think she's a bad person, she just has trouble saying no. \n\nYou aren't the bad guy for not wanting to pay for the entire vacation either. \n\nI think  you need to sit down and really get down to the nitty gritty of the situation. You clearly cannot keep going the way you have and need to communicate clearly what you need and what you're willing to compromise on. She needs to do the same. And perhaps agree on an amount that she can use to help her son, so she has more of a crutch to lean on when saying no.", "I had a lot of sympathy for the wife until I reached the point where you said she dropped $5,000 for them. \n\nShe needs to understand that her enabling behavior is why this continues to happen. And if you\u2019re paying for more now, you\u2019re subsidizing her charity and enabling her.\n\nIt sucks that the vacation is canceled, but honestly \u201cjust hotels, rental car, and some reservations\u201d still seems like a lot. NTA.", "NTA.  The budgeting was agreed upon beforehand.  It is now impossible to do under that agreed upon budget.", "NTA.  I think parting ways is the best solution. She clearly loves enabling irresponsible. Let her do that. Don't be a part of it. Cut your losses ASAP.", "NTA. Normally, I find it strange when couples are this hung up on who pays for what, but in this case, I'm with you. Your wife isn't taking care of her son, she's enabling him. It's obviously going to be tough for her to turn the money faucet off, but she's going to have to if her son is ever going to learn to be an adult.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to nip this in the bud. Stay firm.", "NTA we all make choices and sometimes those choices have unfortunate but predictable outcomes. Paying 5gs because two grown men can\u2019t scrape up rent between them will have the natural consequence of not having 5gs to spend on other things.", "You mean to tell me you didn\u2019t want to support her while she supports her ex husband and adult son?

Why do you think she married you for???", "NTA\n\nYour wife enables her son being a bum, you would enable her enable her son if you didn't make her feel that there are consequesnces of her helping like that.\n\nHer son will always be her priority, and I get that she feels like she's helping, but she's really not. She's keeping them where they are by always bailing them out. While it's not on you to rectify that, she needs to see what she's doing, and if she's okay with that, you can decide if you're okay with being married to someone like that.", "NTA. Before canceling I would give a heads up, \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t come up with your half of the vacation expenses? Then I guess we have to cancel.\u201d", "Nta.  And your wife needs help with her codependency (that's on her).  There are consequences to actions.  And I think this is a very healthy boundary.   The question is what do you want to do?  If she doesn't change and doesn't get help is this the life you want?  What happens when it is her 30 year old son and his kids?", "NTA she's talking like it isn't the normal course of things. You'd be an AH if it was a one off but this is just the state of things. Last time I checked, making agreements, routinely breaking them and then blaming the other person is no bueno.", "NTA. Time to go to counseling or decide if you want this to be your life forever. Honestly, I'd go to the vacation by myself.", "NTA. She can get herself a better paying job if she wants to keep supporting 2 adults her son is not a child anymore. $5000 is hardly a small amount of money, and why can\u2019t her son ride a bike or take the bus to work? It is completely unreasonable to expect you to be indirectly supporting them.", "NTA. There is no reason she needs to take care of two able bodied men financially. My parents were always willing to help me and my siblings out financially at that age if needed, but that\u2019s because we had actual careers we were getting started with and didn\u2019t make a lot of money yet. It would be somewhat different if the son showed any drive to better his life, but he isn\u2019t. And there\u2019s no excuse for helping the ex.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand the comments saying you should\u2019ve said to her before cancelling the vacation. She didn\u2019t speak to you about spending her 5k on her ex and son, so why should you tell her that you were cancelling it and keeping your 5k (hypothetical number since it was mentioned you were splitting 50/50 for this one) \nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you had the money to cover her portion, she was clearly just expecting you to do that anyway given her response. She thought she could spend her half and then have you still pay for her.\nYou had an agreement that you would both pay your equal share and she was aware of that, just like she\u2019s aware that her ex and son are always asking for money so if anything SHE should\u2019ve accounted for that.\nId put firm boundaries that your money in no way shape or form going to cover costs for them or cover the costs for things she\u2019s meant to be paying her share for. Don\u2019t keep covering the bill, she can\u2019t say you\u2019re being financially abusive if you both have your own income and she\u2019s choosing to give it away with no repayment to her son and ex knowing she can just live off of you cause you\u2019ll pay for her.\nNot just the ex husband and the son that are moochers, seems she is aswell, she just hides it with the caring mother act.", "NTA!\n\nYou are totally in the right here. \n\n\\- your stepson and your wifes ex obviously take advantage for you so they are aholes here 100%\n\n\\- your wife gets an ahole rating for letting herself exploited and failing to say no to the demands of her ex and her son\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife has to set boundaries to her ex husband and your step-son. Helping them out in need is not a bad thing but if you allow your wife to help them out too much they will start exploiting your wife and you. Tbh sounds a bit like they already do.\n\nIn your position I wouldn't cancel the vacation though! Makes you seem petty. Instead enjoy your vacation and then have a serious talk with your wife about the issue. Tell her that she has to limit the \"support\" she gives. Firstly the ex-husband doesn't deserve anything imo. He is totally unrelated to you and after the breakup your wife has no obligation to do anything for him. Your stepson I would support but only if he is in real need. Also you need to set an upper limit. Finally talk with your wife about the consequences it will have an your relationship if she continues to mindlessly donate her money, meant for your relationship, away to grown up men.", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nI get helping out your son on the odd occasion if something unexpected comes up but this seems to be an ongoing problem that she is making worse by enabling them, especially if they have had 5k from her.\n\nI'd have no problems dying on this hill and don't blame you for canceling the trip. If you'd have just covered her portion then you'd be enabling her to keep on giving to them. Maybe when she starts to miss out on things she wants to do (holidays) she will think twice before giving them money in the future.", "Your wife sounds like the woman my dad married. My dad is stuck with her 30yo son living in his basement, floating from job to job because she feels guilty son grew up without a father.  Meanwhile she keeps enabling his lazy ass.  My dad refuses to drop an ultimatum because his wife will pick her son.  \n\nI guess you need to decide if you want the rest of your life to look like this.\n\nAnd definitely NTA", "NTA - I think that how you set up your finances was reasonable given the difference in income. You stated what you felt comfortable with financially, but her ex and son are taking major advantage of her. They are adults who need to take care of themselves, and he continues to bail them out means they know they do not have to. Canceling when it cannot be covered because she does not have the funds makes sense since she cannot meet what was agreed to. Counseling for you two may be a good step because finances are a major cause of relationship troubles. Also, it seems it may help her with the dependency issue that has developed between her and her ex and son.", "NTA. \n\nThat said. I still find it weird that married couples split up costs per how much each person makes, and expect each other to cover certain percentages of everything. Like, what's the point of getting married if your gonna do this to each other? My wife and I have 1 checking account and 1 savings account and our own retirement funds from our jobs. Everything we need or pay for just comes out of OUR checking account. We are married and on the same team.

Yours is the definition of help in a vacuum sans any emotional attachment. It's great to say that you should actually attack the root cause of an issue and that is defined as help. I agree with this assesment that the wife is not actually helping and just enabling the behavior. I agree that what she is doing will never allow for growth or change and that the husband is enabling her to enable them financially. But, sometimes help is not accepted. Let's use your alcoholic analogy but make it a child and not a friend. If her kid is an alcoholic that lives on his own and spends way too much money to the point that he doesn't have rent or food that's an issue. Adressing the root cause of it \"the kids alcoholism\" is the right move. Going with them to the grocery store or getting them in rehab are valid options, but what if the kid doesn't believe they have a problem? What if when offering to help address the root of the issue the mother is met with denial and anger? People that tend to have issues don't like to be reminded or even shown that they have an issue. Since the truth is they probably know but aren't ready to admit it yet. Common sense would say just cut these people out of your life because they are exhibiting toxic behavior that is now affecting the person trying to help. But, this person is your child. You don't give up on your children, you always try to love and protect them, and if they won't address the root cause of their issue you find a way to help any way you can.
