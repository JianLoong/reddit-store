Its not like you posted a little kid.\n\nI hope you are able to get the mom to make the repair.", "NTA. Now that the mother has contacted you, you know exactly who to take to small claims court!", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2019t even imagine what my mother would say if I was caught doing something like that. You\u2019d be receiving a hefty check from my own savings account and my mom would make me fix it myself. She\u2019d probably send a muffin basket or something as well. It amazes me how parents are surprised that their children turn into people who don\u2019t realize consequences exist when they coddle them so much.", "NTA!

From the mothers response we can see where he gets the bad attitude from.", "NTA whatsoever. If he didn\u2019t want that to happen, he should\u2019ve thought about it before he damaged your property. Also, it\u2019s only fair for you to warn your community, especially if no action will be taken legally or financially to fix it.", "NTA. \"Boys will be boys\" doesn't translate to criminal damage.

Stuff their reputation", "NTA. \"Boys will be boys\" is digging a hole at the beach or laughing at farts, it isn't causing property damage to someone's shelter who is already struggling (which sounds like it may have even been targeted specifically because he thinks there will be no consequences).\n\nNot being punished for this will lead this boy to much worse situations than having to get a job or do some chores to earn the money to pay a few hundred bucks to replace a window.", "My parents would have beat the shit outta me if I broke somebody's window as a kid", "NTA.  Take the mother to small claims court and make her pay for the window + court costs as soon as you can.", "I would probably double down with a follow-up post that the culprit has identified but the mother is enabling his behavior.. but I'm petty like that.
