Each of our sides of the family are fairly big. It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings.\n\nWe have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9 and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee. \n\nSo obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost.\n\nWell, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc.\n\nSo AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?", "created_utc": 1679326118, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wlstw/aita_for_having_a_dry_wedding_and_serving_only/", "score": 792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not about making the wedding dry. That's perfectly fine. But damn, give people some options to drink. Some carbonated water if anything.", "YTA - I don't have anything against dry weddings but surely you can offer something other than just water.  Iced Tea?  Lemonade?  Something with flavor?  When my cousin had a dry wedding she served sodas.  Your guests are not likely to think it's very celebratory if you just serve water.  And you would be surprised by the number of people who NEVER drink water, let alone do it at celebrations.", "I know that technically you could be in the right, but here\u2019s the thing about weddings, the marriage ceremony is for you and your fianc\u00e9. The wedding is for everyone you\u2019ve invited, it\u2019s an event you\u2019re hosting, and not providing any drinks other than water makes you a bad host/hostess. \n\nI\u2019ve been to dry weddings. There was a couple that put real thought and effort into designing mocktails themed around their relationship. It was delightful and everyone connected to the couple through it. Another couple had a sparkling cider tower in place of champagne and everyone cheered with cider in flutes. \n\nWhen you\u2019re hosting an event, your job as hostess is to take care of your guests. Just because it follows a marriage ceremony doesn\u2019t make you any less the host of an event. And that means providing more than one drink option, especially non alcoholic. Especially to an event your guests are incurring expenses to attend and bringing gifts to. \n\nYTA honestly. I fully support a dry wedding but only water as a beverage is being a cheap host.", "Sounds pretty brutal. How will they wash down their saltine and lettuce entrees?", "YTA, not due to the no alcohol rule. I like drinking, but I can very much have a nice evening without it and whoever doesnt, should check if they have an alcohol problem.\n\nI think YTA because only water, no Soda, no juice, no coffee is totally bland and boring.\n\nWhy do you even invite people? Why marry with (so many) guests at all? Just let it be the two of you and drink your boring water (and yes, I think of myself as a hydrohomie, but also as someone who loves having guests and spoiling them)", "YTA - it isn\u2019t that expensive to get some sort of punch bowl or soda fountain going. Or a coffee-and-tea bar with some flavored syrups and a couple of cream options.  \n\nI think just having pitchers of tap water and nothing else is going to look like you forgot to do something for beverages. Or people are going to start nitpicking looking for other places they think you cut corners on the budget.  Weddings are supposed to be celebrations, and this just doesn\u2019t seem very festive.", "I wouldn't necessarily say YTA but your wedding sounds boring and I wouldn't want to go.", "YTA. This is so bad it\u2019s funny. If you\u2019re not having alcohol, offer a variety of nice beverages to choose from\u2026soft drinks, iced tea, a signature virgin cocktail, coffee/tea with dessert. If you cannot afford to properly host your guests, then you may in fact have too many guests. Or you need to cut costs in other ways. But treat your guests as though you actually want them to be there.", "Listen, it\u2019s your wedding and you can do what you want. But also, you\u2019re HOSTING an event. Not having alcohol is one thing, but not even having coffee, soda, or tea? It feels cheap and inconsiderate, so for that, YTA.", "Hmmm. Part of hosting a party is providing for your guests. Only offering water seems unwelcoming and sort of tacky. I think having some soft drinks, lemonade, ice tea, flavored bubbly water, or similar wouldn\u2019t break the bank. I\u2019m going with a soft YTA.", "YTA. People are going out of their way to celebrate your day, traveling, taking the time to look nice, buying you gifts and giving cash etc. And you can't be bothered to at least serve them some yummy options other than water? Coffee, tea and a few soda selections would be completely appropriate for a dry wedding.\n\nI wouldn't come just because it's clear that you have zero respect for the comfort and pleasure of your guests. For shame.", "I have to say YTA, NOT because of the no alcohol, that's fine to make that call, but to only serve water?  That's....just no.  You really need to have something other than water for people to drink.  A collection of soda flavors is a bare minimum.", "Soft YTA. No juice, or pop?

Cash bar would include soda, but if you want a dry wedding, at least have coffee, punch, and iced tea. You don't have to pay for much, but it does make it a little nicer", "YTA This isn\u2019t a dry wedding issue. This is more about the unwillingness to offer any options beyond plain water. You could offer lemonade, coffee, tea, or anything that is within your cultural zone. Have you considered adding some fruit to water dispensers for added color and flavor? \n\nJust remember that you are inviting guests to your wedding.

No Mocktails or anything like that? It's a bit fucking odd.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re hosting guests who are celebrating your wedding by bringing gifts/traveling to see you.

Offer tea, coffee after dinner, a cash bar\u2014anything more than water.", "I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, just a shit wedding. People are gunna talk, call you cheap, think you\u2019re weird. The no alcohol is weird enough, but just water, lmfao. People are gunna walk out early.", "A dry wedding is totally fine and normal, but ONLY water? Not even some lemonade or apple cider? Sweet tea? I guess that's your call but its pretty lame. NAH, don't be surprised if people leave early or bring their own drinks.", "You and your husband are hosting, it\u2019s your first event as a married couple.\n\nI understand having a dry wedding. However, only water.\n\nCould you at least do some infused water with berries or cucumbers as an option. Lemonade?\n\nAre you serving tea/coffee with with cake?\n\nI\u2019m a vegetarian and served meat options at the wedding because I wanted our guests to have a good experience. There were lots of things I paid for with our wedding that I didn\u2019t eat/drink, but I did it because we were hosting family and friends and wanted them to enjoy themselves. \n\nIs this first impression you want as married couple?\n\nSoft YTA because only water.", "Yta. \nNot having alcohol is reasonable. You\u2019re having a lot of guests, so you should take them into consideration with an open bar. \n\nBut nothing to drink but water\u2026 \nDo you really not mind being the wedding that people will remember as cheap and not considerate of guests by only serving water. \n\nI don\u2019t drink alcohol and I enjoy drinking water all day long. However, I\u2019d never do that to guests at any event or party I was hosting. I definitely wouldn\u2019t do that to my wedding guests.", "YTA not for the dry wedding but for the lack of beverage options. Offer tea, lemonade, some sort of fun fruity drink. You are hosting a party and it isn't all about you. It's for your guests.", "YTA.\n\nWhen someone visits your home, do you only offer them water \"since that's all you drink\"?\n\nSeriously, this takes an insane amount of ignorance of how entertaining guests works. It's your day, sure. But you invited all these people to be your guest for the experience. You have a responsibility as their host.", "YTA. Not having alcohol? Sure. I've been to dry weddings - they're less fun, but I respected it. (The couple were from very Mormon families)\n\nBut not serving lemonade, or iced tea? Even coffee service after dinner and cake? That goes from frugal to cheap. BTW: I am someone who doesn't drink sodas, etc. - literally water is my absolute preference. But if I'm having guests, I have some selection to be a good host.\n\nAnd if people have heard about your water-only edict, I'm sure they're concerned that you've also cheaped out on the food.", "YTA, not because you're having a dry wedding but because of the 'only water'. You've left frugal territory and entered into cheap,   \n\n\nI understand your position, both in terms of cost and you personally not consuming soda, but you are hosting a party where, I would assume, you want your guests to have a great time. There are reasonable expenses associated with hosting a wedding and you should make an effort to be accommodating toward the needs/desires of your guests in addition to your own. At least serve some iced tea or something.   \n\n\nIt also doesn't necessarily need to be that expensive depending on the rules of your venue. My sister had a dry wedding this past January and they used my Sam's Club membership to buy a variety of sodas in bulk then brought those to the venue to serve on the day of the wedding. Didn't cost more than a couple hundred bucks.", "Are you an AH? No. Does this sound like the worst wedding ever? Yes. Look your wedding, your choice and all that jazz but this is one party I would actively avoid. I wouldn't be upset I just wouldn't come. Anywho Slainte NAH.", "YWBTA.  Don't skimp on things that will make your guests comfortable.", "N T A for having a dry wedding, it happens. If you want to compromise like others said have a cash bar. I had a dry wedding, but now a days it\u2019s normal to have something. Especially if you want people to dance, have fun, and stay a while. Doesn\u2019t make you an a-hole for wanting it to stay dry, but you have to also understand some people aren\u2019t going to stay for it or be happy about it and that doesn\u2019t make them a-holes either.\n\nHowever I don\u2019t agree with only having water, a lot of people don\u2019t even like water, especially with their meal. Around me the very least people do at stuff like this is have a choice of lemonade and tea to go along with water (sometimes adding punch or coffee) They are cheap and easy to make, I get sodas can be overwhelming but there\u2019s too many other choices to limit people to just water.\n\nI\u2019d say a light YTA it\u2019s your wedding and your choice but that\u2019s super limiting and cheap.", "We had a dry wedding (because it was 10am at a church), but had water, coffee, iced tea, and lemonade. The increased expense was minimal, and worth it.", "YTA. Not for having a dry wedding--if you guys don't drink, you can cheerfully skip that part--but for not having anything ELSE. It's wild to me that you're even asking. No, you can't skip out on having any beverages other than water. You OBVIOUSLY can't do that! Soda, lemonade, etc, are super normal and just like, not actually optional. It's the same way you can't skip out on catering and say you're just going to provide chips and dip. Sure, it would be cheaper, but it's not how things work.", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA\n\nWe hired a family friend who had their serving it safe license to do the bartending.  We bought mix from a wholesaler so it was cheaper. Our liquor store does a buy back so anything that\u2019s unopened can be returned for what you paid, helped with the overall budget. We scoured second hand shops for drink ware and we were able to sell most on fb marketplace afterwards so we didn\u2019t have to rent drink ware. \n\nAs much as it sucks and is rude, people will talk about your wedding for years to come and not in a nice way.  They\u2019ll tell people \u2018don\u2019t be like so in so who only served water\u2019", "We generally only drink water, but anytime we have guests over for anything we also have soda or at least lemonade or tea. It's just being a good host. YTA, not for the dry part but for not doing any other drink options besides water.", "YTA\n\nWhile it is your wedding, you are also the **hostess**. Not bringing soda or juice is why YTA. \n\nHave a cash bar between the wedding and reception if alcohol bothers you that much. You'll be busy anyways taking pictures and wont notice.", "NTA, but perhaps you can compromise? Cash bar and soda. Provide flavored water, tea, lemonade\u2026 perhaps do buffet style to save on food too. Oooorrrr another option I have seen is a morning wedding with a reception from 1-5. Provided snacks, but no meal. Cake was there too but instead of a big fancy thing, it was Costco sheet cakes and the couple just had a little cake for them to cut. Lots of savings there . Think outside the box . Good luck!", "YTA. you can have a dry wedding if that is your preference. but \u201cdry\u201d and \u201conly water\u201d are very different, and I can\u2019t think of anyone I know who wouldn\u2019t complain or judge in some way, or decline the invitation all together. you\u2019re serving more than just your favorite foods, right? you took into account that you will be hosting an event with many guests and tried to get a variety of foods to appeal to them? and yet you don\u2019t see how serving only water at a multi-hour crowded party without alcohol would not be well-received or make guests think you\u2019re a bad host?", "YTA, I understand the no alcohol part, but you really should be offering other beverage choices. Scale back on the dinner to help with the cost of the beverages. In the past, I've had customers buy things like liquor, beer, soda, tea, juice, and coffee in bulk when it is on sale, especially when it is a wedding, family reunion, or large gathering. If you choose to offer other beverage options and have extras, give it to family or donate to a local food bank.", "Soft YTA. The ceremony is all about you. The reception though is really supposed to be a thank you to the guests for coming to the ceremony. So you need to look at this more with the guests in mind. Maybe you don\u2019t drink anything but water but your 100 guests probably do. \n\nHaving a dry wedding is ok. Guests aren\u2019t entitled to alcohol. But guests probably aren\u2019t going to feel super welcome if you\u2019re just giving them bread and water. Spring for coffee/tea and juice at least. And realize if there isn\u2019t alcohol people will likely not stay as long or dance as much.", "as a sober person, i plan to have a no alcohol wedding - however to just have water as an option is a little\u2026.much. there are plenty of NA beers, even sparkling water. i suggest having several\noptions of beverages than just water.", "Id recommend at least giving people soft drinks. Your family is there for wedding and its a long evening for them to just have water only.\n\nAlso i know weddings are expesnive but even id you pay a pound a pop for a coke, it still only adds 150 to the total ans in the grand scheme of things, is that really that bad?\n\nThe thing is, I get you dont want people getting shit faced at your wedding, but at the same time, alcohol can be nice for a celebration and people are more likely to mingle and dance if theyve bad abit to drink as well.", "I know it's your party and all, but cheaping out on soft drinks is taking it too far in my opinion. Your water-only lifestyle is rather unique; most people have juice or soda to their dinner on daily basis. At the very least, it's going to weird them out, at worst they'll take it as a proxy how much you value the relationship with them (as in, not at all).\n\nGoing alcohol-free on wedding is also very unusual. But it's more culture-specific. In my culture, not having alcohol would mean 90% of traditional wedding party games are out, starting off with \"gorzko, gorzko\" - a loooooong, long kiss between groom and bride to \"sweeten the vodka for the guests\". I've never heard of a Polish wedding that didn't have that part.\n\nIn short - your party your rules, but you can be damn sure it's going straight to the top of every guest's list of worst weddings they ever attended.", "Wow. \n\nA dry wedding is fine and your decision.  Maybe include iced tea and lemonade?\n\nI don't see this as much of an AH move as being a penny pinching move.", "N-T-A only if you are cool with everyone leaving the moment it is socially acceptable to do so and not a minute later", "I think YTA not for the dry wedding, but for insisting on only having water and basically refusing any options where guests might be able to have anything else (open bar, etc). Part of weddings is playing host to people which means catering for your guests. You don\u2019t have to bankrupt yourself paying for everyone\u2019s alcohol, but serving just plain water at a big celebratory event seems a bit too much in the other direction.", "I normally would say your wedding your choice. BUT come on, only serving water is ridiculous and a slap in the face ri your friends/family who are coming to your wedding and bringing gifts. It's like you're saying \"I like you enough to invite you to our wedding, BUT not enough to spend a couple dollars so you have the choice to drink something other than water\"", "Why can\u2019t you have lemonade and ice tea too? I\u2019m going with a soft YTA for only offering water. There are other options besides soda and alcohol.", "YTA\nI think it\u2019s totally fine to have a dry wedding. You don\u2019t drink! It makes sense. Some people will complain because they depend on alcohol to cope with social situations but if you don\u2019t drink, a dry wedding makes total sense.\n\nThat said, only serving water is weird. For a dry wedding, depending on formality, I would expect sparkling water and soda (more casual) or some sort of fun \u201cmocktail\u201d/fancy soda/raspberry or mint lemonade thing. I think you can do just fine with sparkling water, and purchased lemonade from Costco or Walmart that you have the caterer add mint or lavender or raspberry pur\u00e9e or something to jazz it up a bit. But it would be very strange to only serve water.\n\nIn terms of \u201cisn\u2019t water what most people drink?\u201d, No. Not in America. A lot of people don\u2019t drink water at all. And certainly not at a festive occasion. A nice flavored drink is more celebratory.", "I do get a dry wedding but I think people will remember  that you were cheap because you couldn't offer something besides water.", "YTA for only having water, but not for having a dry wedding.\n\nBut please consider having alternatives to \u201cjust water\u201d. Bottled water is not much cheaper than soda, or fruit juices, or having flavoured water.", "YTA just for not wanting to have soda or juice or literally anything but water. Personally, I could deal with a dry wedding (I would definitely leave early because it would get real boring real fast), but I would be annoyed by having nothing to drink except water, and that\u2019s coming from a person who already drinks water 95% of the time because my cardiologist says I can only have one caffeinated drink per day!", "NTA for alcohol free.\n\nBut YTA for  you expect everyone to drink water just because you guys only drink water. Serve cool drinks, lemonades, milkshakes something. Alcohol free champagne? But just water... Wow.", "YTA\n\nI get that it is your wedding, and you can do whatever you want.

It's totally fine that you don't drink anything but water, *but you know that other people drink other things*. \n\nUltimately, you get to decide what you serve, but it's completely predictable and understandable that people are annoying that you're only providing water at a wedding meal, and if that's your choice, you should be prepared for people to remember it and be upset about it.", "YWNBTA but don't be surprised if people don't stay long/don't want to come", "YTA (only slightly) - yes it\u2019s your wedding and it should be your decision overall, but if you\u2019re expecting people to show up and celebrate YOUR marriage, the least you can do is provide them with a few more options for drinks.

I think you\u2019ll find a lot of them will view you both as cheap if you only serve water(sorry for the brutal honesty!)", "Gentle YTA.  By not providing anything other than water you're risking your guests going out and getting their own drinks and breaking any venue contracts and then losing your deposit.  I would provide soda/tea/lemonade at the least.", "YTA. Not even coffee with the cake? You're being ridiculous. \n\nI'd be unhappy for that with the meal in the first place, because I don't like the taste of plain water, but I recognize that's an unusual stance. Though I do think most people will expect, at a bare minimum, unsweetened iced tea to be available, and preferably some very basic alternatives like lemonade and seltzer. \n\nBut no coffee and hot tea, or milk for the children, when serving any sort of desert course is kind of a dick move, and your wedding will be the talk of both of your families for months. Not the good type of talk.", "You\u2019d only be the AH if you get mad that people don\u2019t come, leave early, or otherwise don\u2019t enjoy themselves on your happy day. \n\nI get a dry reception.

Like, no one will remember the tablecloths, or whether you had table runners, or what type of chair you had, but people will remember things like whether you only had water or if the ceremony / reception were an hour away from one another. \n\nYou don\u2019t *have* to spend your money this way, obviously, and it\u2019s your wedding. But giving it a thought doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nPart of the fun of my wedding was knowing everyone else was having a good time celebrating with us at the reception.

Not going to touch the alcohol thing.\n\nNothing besides water? That\u2019s the cheapest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Cake but no coffee? There is hot water & teabags and coffee for free in a zillion places as a sign of hospitality and a thanks to your customers/guests (two places I\u2019ve been recently with a coffee/tea station were an imaging center where I got a chest x-Ray and a veterinarian\u2019s office). \n\nIt\u2019s about being hospitable to your guests.", "YTA.

I'm not the type who needs to load up on free wedding booze, and I mostly drink water too, but your choice seems thoughtless. Good for you if you don't drink juice or soda or coffee in your daily life, but a reception is for your guests, and no matter how good the food is (and I shudder to think what you think is 'good' if you think a water wedding will be fun), you're not being a good host by providing nothing but water.

However, I do believe that you're an AH for only serving water. Yes, people drink water everyday, but it's basically the most boring thing to drink. I much prefer drinking something with flavor instead of just water because it's refreshing for my palette, and when I'm at an event or out for dinner, I always spring for soda or iced tea for the same reason. I get that you and your fiance don't drink much of anything but water, but I don't think that's something you should subject your guests to. Pay for the costs of soda or at least flavor infused water; give your guests at least something to enjoy sipping on with their meal instead of plain, boring water.", "Yta.\n\nEven the cheapest catered buffet sets come with some kind of flavoured drinks. Because yes people drink water, but people also drink other things, and having a variety of drinks is normal.\n\nIf you are that financially strapped, maybe offer hot water and a variety of tea bags.

I wouldn't even dare do that for my preschooler's birthday party.", "YTA but softly, a dry wedding is fine but just water is like saying I only grilled cheese sandwiches so only that will be provided, it is the bare minimum drinkwise. Your example with the coffee is like I don't eat bread so no break will be provided.\nImo just filtered water makes you look cheap..but you do you.

It's fine that it's dry (just set your expectations accordingly) but to ONLY serve water? While a wedding IS for you and your spouse, the reception is to thank your guests.

While I drink my britta every day, it's NOT what's best for hosting a LARGE event. Are you going to get like a poland springs dispenser? Like what? I'm sure the catering can include canned/bottled beverages for an up charge. \n\nIf you are looking to save money, have fewer people, choose a cheaper meal, or have an afternoon reception that ends before a meal time. 1pm ceremony.

I personally think expecting ppl to shell out their time and money to attend a wedding (likely on a Sat night) and then tell them they can't have a drink BC YOU DON'T is rude bc being a host is not about what you do but showing your guests hospitality.\n\nSince budget is clearly a big issue here, you can make it a cash bar.

Sometimes a dry wedding is the right thing, but it\u2019s asking a LOT of your guests to:\n- Save your date when they could be doing something else.\n- get dressed up, possibly buying new clothes \n- sit through a ceremony \n- be gracious to all your guests, even the ones they\u2019d prefer not to be around\n- bring a gift\n\nAnd you can\u2019t even provide a little caffeine to help them out? Coffee and tea, my friend, if nothing else, are musts. \n\nBut unless your family are problematic alcoholics who will ruin your wedding if allowed to drink, or you are a problematic alcoholic who cannot be around others who are drinking, you\u2019re kind of a lame host for not letting them purchase their own alcohol at your reception.", "The booze-free part sounds fair. But only serving water is a bit odd. Sure, it's universal, but people enjoy consuming things they like while they are celebrating. That doesn't have to be alcohol, but some option/variety would be a nice gesture for your guests. \n\nIt's an odd one, because it's not necessarily an A H move but I think it's such an unusual decision that it's going to make your guests feel a little uncomfortable and perhaps trepidatious that there might be other rules that make the day \"dull\".\n\nGentle YTA because it just doesn't seem conducive to hosting an enjoyable event.", "I mean it\u2019s your wedding, but if I heard there was only going to be water and no other alternatives (not even talking about alcohol), I wouldn\u2019t show up.\n\nBuying few cases of coke products and juice containers isn\u2019t going to hurt anyone\u2019s budget.

You are diverging too far from social norms (in a direction that suggests cheapness and/or lack of hospitality) for this to go down well. \n\nFruit juice! Soft drinks! Tea! Coffee! Mocktails! There is a wide range of options from cheap to expensive. Water just looks like you're being deliberately cheap or pointedly ascetic, and either way it won't be remembered fondly. \n\n(I don't drink either.

My dad was an alcoholic, and my family is full of alcoholics in denial. Like for a 2pm Sunday birthday party for my 4yo twins my BIL brought two bottles of liquor to my house! I held my ground, and my uncles left the reception to go get beer at a bar. It was also a super short reception. At least no one drove home drunk and no one was spilling their drinks on my on the dance floor.  I did, however, offer free pop and water so they had options. Maybe consider lemonade or tea that can be made in a big container like a restaurant does?", "NTA for not serving alcohol people can live, but YTA for only offer water would it really be so hard to get some soda and juice? It\u2019s reasonable that you don\u2019t drink, but just serving water makes you come across as cheap and a bad host. It\u2019s your wedding so it\u2019s your choice at the end of the day, but it really doesn\u2019t seem hard to throw some sodas or juice in there. Doesn\u2019t even have to be name brand, Important to remember the reception is for the guests, and just plain water isn\u2019t very exciting", "YTA At least supply coffee and tea. Soda and a glass of wine with dinner is not hard. These are your guests not the inmates.", "YTA. Sorry, but it will be boring. And you\u2019re cheap. You need to think about your guests if you want anyone to show up. People are even willing to pay for their own drinks if it\u2019s a cash bar. But you\u2019re too cheap to pay a bartender? Do what you want, but people will talk accordingly about the time they had.", "YTA. You want to be a good host? Then you should at least offer more than water. You literally want to invite so many people but go the cheapest possible option when it comes to drinks. I get it, you don't drink much else. But most people you invite drink more than that. Not YTA for a dry wedding. That's a completely different topic.", "NAH. I think you should be allowed to do whatever you want. You money, your wedding.

Each of our sides of the family are fairly big. It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings.\n\nWe have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9 and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee. \n\nSo obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost.\n\nWell, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc.\n\nSo AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Every dry wedding I've ever been to has been held in the parking lot of the venue where people bring their own coolers of stuff to drink.", "Lemonade would be good in addition to tea and coffee.

How is that different to offering a bar and allowing guests to pay for their own drinks. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d pay for a barman, it sounds like the venue has a bar? Then you let your guests pay and enjoy what they want. Water only sounds like a vegetarian forcing a salad and tofu on everyone for a 3 course dinner.", "At least splurge on some packets of Crystal Light so this wedding won't be the absolute worst one they ever attended. YTA.", "I mean\u2026.hard to call you an asshole, just boring and cheap. No alcohol is fine, but no beverages outside water *at all*? Is just weird, wedding or not.\n\nI think YTA, you can have iced tea or lemonade and coffee for dessert. Who throws *any* party without proper refreshment?", "You should at least have soda. I am all for having a wedding you can afford but some minimum standards should be there.", "NAH\n\nYour wedding will probably suck, but it\u2019s your wedding so throw it however you want. I recently went to a dry wedding, everyone left early and no one danced. Even that wedding had mocktails because who just serves water?", "Having a dry wedding is absolutely fine. But JUST water? That's honestly kind of awful. And what about dessert, no coffee or tea just because YOU don't drink it? That's getting into YTA territory.", "YTA\n\nWhile it is your wedding, you are the hosting a special event.  You are going out of your way to make it un-special.\n\nWhile I would look forward to seeing someone get married, I certainly will not feel obligated to dress up for a mass produced chicken dinner with water.\n\nAnd you know what?  On a normal day or a typical \"out to eat\" because we are traveling and/or shopping, I almost \\*always\\* get water.  On a special occasion, I will get something (usually diet coke) because it is a special occasion and not something I drink on the daily.\n\nAt the very least, provide juice/sparkling water, sweet tea and mocktails.  coffee with dessert. I would feel unwelcome with \"here is dinner with your WATER\"  - with a side of that is all you deserve, because I don't really care that you are here.

The invites usually say closed bar, open bar, or dry wedding, and people will adjust how much money they give you in your wedding gift based on that.

Part of hosting is making people comfortable and some choice of beverages is part of that. You don\u2019t have to provide alcohol but to only provide water is rude. At minimum- offer iced tea (extremely inexpensive to make with cold tea bags) and some powdered drink mixes to liven up the water.", "NTA for the dry wedding, but maybe meet people halfway with juice and soda? My fiance and I are having a mostly dry wedding because I'm sober and she rarely drinks- we're only doing a champagne toast. But we're still going to have juice and soda.", "Sounds like a lot of fun! /s", "NTA but you're spending a lot of money just so people leave right after dinner.", "Listen, I get it. I\u2019m grumpy that my upcoming wedding is going to have wine and beer. My husband has a beer maybe once a month and I don\u2019t drink at all, and I don\u2019t really like being around drunk people. If it\u2019s \u201cour day\u201d shouldn\u2019t we get to decide this stuff? It does bother me that so many people in our lives (mostly parents\u2019 friends and older relatives) seem to absolutely demand/expect that we will get them wasted on our wedding day. \n\nBUT it\u2019s not a party for literally only me. It\u2019s to celebrate me and my partner and our marriage, but the idea is that we\u2019re hosting a party *that we hope guests will enjoy themselves at* and it turns out beverages are real important to people. I\u2019d stick to your guns on having a dry wedding if you can (I lost that fight with my parents and partner, but I think we also can do some social engineering to make sure the bar doesn\u2019t let anyone get plastered which was my main ick anyways) but I do think it will feel inhospitable to your guests to not even allow the caterers to provide lemonade and iced tea, for example, or juices and a few sodas. \n\nI know that's going to feel galling to you (believe me, I *know*, I'm making about eight thousand compromises for my event) but try to think if it as a way to provide something fun and yummy to your guests, many of whom you probably like. The cognitive dissonance in everyone saying \"it's your day!!!\" and also \"but why aren't you doing it how I want!\" is big, I get it.

You can lead a wedding guest to water, but you can't make them drink. Anyway, soft YTA cause just water sounds too bland for a party.", "YTA. It\u2019s supposed to be a party. Having a dry wedding is fine, but most people are going to expect something a little more interesting than just water.", "YTA - I am a strong believer that if you are going to have a wedding, you can do it however you please. However, it still needs to be somewhat accommodating to your guests. Because without them, you wouldn\u2019t have anyone to celebrate with! Having a dry wedding it perfectly fine, and most people would respect that. But only water? Why? Here are some options that are super affordable and is more accommodating to your guests: \n\nBYOB is a free option. Buying soda, lemonade, ice tea is a very very affordable option. Coffee and tea with the dessert / cake is also an affordable option.  Mocktails are a bit more expensive but would make the wedding more fun, IMO.", "It does sound pretty grim. Why not make it vegan and save money with paper plates while you're at it? My point is that water may seem fine to you, but it does look a bit cheap and joyless to your guests. You invited them to help you celebrate. That does obligate you  to meet their preferences. \n\nIt sounds like it's all gotten out of control. Maybe elope instead?", "NTA for the dry wedding\n\nbut you really do need some variety in drinks. this is coming from another water lover, and only water lover. like with food, people will want at least some options. \n\nbelieve it or not, there are a concerning amount of people out there who cant stand water. so for them at least have something else.", "YTA. Not for having a dry wedding, that\u2019s fine. But having only water is a little annoying. It\u2019s a special occasion, maybe at least sparkling water? Juice for the kids? Your wedding, your choice of course. But it\u2019s like you hate fun", "YTA. They bring you presents and you reward them with water? The only water you should be serving is the one in ice cubes for their whiskeys they like to drink neat", "NAH.

Don't worry, your guest list is going to be so much smaller because frankly, a bad hostess is not worth the bother of attending.  These people are HONORING you by attending your wedding.

It\u2019s ok that some of your family and friends are a little upset. You\u2019re free to have a dry wedding with no alcohol and no other drinks besides water. Your wedding your choice. However just know you are setting up an uncomfortable environment for the 100+ guests you\u2019ve invited. People who are uncomfortable tend to want to end that feeling pretty quickly. Personally I\u2019d leave the wedding as quickly as possible or just decline the invitation. \nYour wedding will probably be remembered for the wrong reasons and you shouldn\u2019t be upset if people decline or walk out early.", "NTA for doing it, but you have to understand that not even serving punch and soda is weird.\n\nIf i was a guest, i wouldn't care, I'd still go to celebrate my loved one, but i would judge you.", "YTA. Spring for a bar tender. Cash bar. Most will be happy. It\u2019s a small wedding gathering. It won\u2019t cost that much for a bar tender. Even if you paid him $50/Hr. That\u2019s maybe $300.", "YTA\nNot everyone like water with every meal.

Obviously your guests shouldn't demand certain things, but we also rely on hosts to consider things that will please guests. \n\nRight now your guests are demanding things. That's not a good look.\n\nBut right now you also don't seem to be putting much thought into pleasing your guests.

People will be talking about your wedding for years, and not in a good way. Weddings are LONG, and for most guests, they involve hours of waiting around. With nothing but water to drink, and no bar, people will probably just leave.\n\nIf you\u2019re seriously planning to go ahead with this, just save yourself all the money and don\u2019t bother with a wedding at all.

I\u2019ve been to a lot of weddings in my time, and the ones that stick out in my mind are the horrid ones where the \u201chosts\u201d didn\u2019t seem to realize they were supposed to be, well, hosting anything, and the results ended up, seeming like they took inspiration from the conservative town in the movie Footloose, instead of treating it like a cautionary tale.\n\nDo what you want, but my husband and I still have an inside joke about some weddings from decades back we think even the Amish would\u2019ve found lame due to lack of beverages, music, etc.", "YTA, a dry wedding is totally fine and your choice. But only serving tap water is boring and cheap. And honestly a bit insulting towards your guests.  Not even a coffee or tea for after dinner? It doesn't have to be a whole lot to choose from, but a few options should be there. Maybe some ice tea, drinks with fruit syrup, or some juice, if you don't want sodas.\n\nIf you can't afford to take care of your guests, you have to plan another kind of wedding or a smaller one.

But, on a practical note, don\u2019t you want to get the full value of everything you\u2019re paying for? Serving a variety of beverages, including coffee or tea as a pick-me-up for when people start to lose steam, helps keep them around and engaged longer. Water only encourages them to eat quickly, say hi and leave. Not serving alcohol could alternatively be an opportunity to get creative with other beverages at a much lower cost. You can have infused lemonades, aqua frescas, punch and many other creative options for relatively low cost (without having to pay for bottled or canned drinks). Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid people won\u2019t feel like celebrating long enough to get to the cake cutting. \n\nYou can\u2019t afford what you can\u2019t afford - I get that.
