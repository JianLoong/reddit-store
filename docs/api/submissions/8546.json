Our families have both been quite supportive, but we live far away from most of our family members due to my wife's job.\n\nMy brother (41M) has recently moved into the city we live in with his family including his wife (30F) and daughters ( 5 and 7). Our kids have always got along quite well with each other and because my brother and his wife both work long shifts, more often than not, they send their kids over to our house so they can spend time with their cousins.\n\nIt is very sweet that they all get along pretty well so my wife and I were happy with the arrangement as long as schoolwork was not being pushed aside. They even study together which is another level of cute. \n\nAnyway, my brother has recently told me that he would appreciate it if my wife and I kept our PDA to a minimum when their kids were over because he firmly thinks that showing affection to your partner in the presence of a child is absolutely wrong on so many levels. He also complained that I am too affectionate with my kids and that was also not appropriate.\n\nI was genuinely confused, because we aren't at all into PDA. We kiss each other hello and goodbye, kiss occasionally, hug, cuddle when we're watching a movie but it is nothing that would pass as inappropriate in my opinion. I asked my wife about this and she agreed with me.\n\nSo I may be TA because I told him I was not going to change my relationship with my wife and kids to please him and if he really didn't want his kids to see that, then he shouldn't send them over to our house.\n\nMy mother called from back home and said my brother was in a bad situation and that I should try and be more understanding with him. As much as I love my nieces, I am not okay with them spending time with us until my brother apologizes. \n\nWas it an AH move?", "created_utc": 1674935147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nnog6/aita_for_not_having_my_nieces_over_until_my/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother on the other hand seems to have issues. Since he's in a bad situation he needs to be more understanding and not tell you what to do in your home", "NTA.

Not to mention that you and your wife are helping him and your sister-in-law. The fact that he feels entitled to police your family and your home is beyond troublesome.\n\nI feel for your mother. She's in a tough spot but by asking you to \"keep the peace\", she is asking you to make yourself small. That isn't right. No one should have to/be expected to make themselves smaller to appease another. Especially a close family member.\n\nI feel bad for all of the children.\n\nEdit.
