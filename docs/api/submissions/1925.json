Especially considering how your niece and nephews treat your own kids.", "So, let me get this straight- they want to send their 3 kids to live with you indefinitely? Without the parents? 3 kids that terrorize your kids? Nope, NTA. There\u2019s no universe in which I\u2019d agree to that.", "NTA, your main reasoning is to protect your children, you're not wrong for that. You could try bringing this up with your wife. Maybe offer to babysit every once in a while, but your first priority should be protecting and taking care of your own children before someone else's.", "SIL isn\u2019t working. Why doesn\u2019t she have time to take care of 3 school aged children?\n\nNTA", "Nta\n\n\"They couldn't find a babysitter that would stay\"... that legit says everything that needs to be said, they couldn't pay someone enough to watch their kids. \n\nIt's a big problem for them, they probably need to find one that costs more.", "Nta, this is definitely a situation everyone needs to be ok with. You're not on board so it can't happen. I'd even go as far as to say your kids opinion should matter here too.", "NTA.\n\nThis is the kind of thing you both really need to be on the same page for.  If she talks you into it, you will resent her for it even if the kids are better behaved than you expected.\n\nIf you're not 100% on board, it will be natural for you to withdraw, spend less time at home, be less helpful in general.  After all, it was her idea, right?  But she will see it as you agreed, so you need to be a full partner.\n\nIf you do end up agreeing to have them, you need to have some very firm rules about behavior, as well as about the length of time you are prepared to have them.", "NTA, if you and your wife already know your SIL\u2019s children\u2019s behaviour and how they act, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t welcome that in your household, especially for your daughter\u2019s sake. However, you probably should have told your wife before messaging the SIL on both of your behalfs", "NTA\n\nSo your wife wants to move 3 kids in: one who terrorises your children and another who purposely breaks things when he cant get his own way, cos fammiiilllyyy? No. What about YOUR family? The kids you have together? Or do they not count in your wife's eyes?\n\nNo wonder they can't keep a sitter. BIL&SIL need to work this out, not unload 3 kids onto you for a undetermined amount of time! \n\nPlus where would they all stay? Would your kids be made to share? Are they going to provide any financial support? I would touch this with a 1000ft barge pole.\n\nIf your wife is set on this, she can move in with the and provide help and support, but I would not distrupt my house and my children.", "NTA. They are the monsters of their parents making it\u2019s not on you to have to live with that and deal with it. They didn\u2019t raise their kids right and now no one can stand to take them. This is a lesson they need to learn. Protect your own kid and point out to your wife her own kid should come first.", "NTA, if their kids are cruel to your children you absolutely **cannot** allow them in your house. For the sake of your kids please stand firm on this.", "Info - is your SIL sick, in addition to being pregnant? I am confused as to why they need what seems like a significant amount of childcare if only one of them is currently working.", "NTA...if everyone is not on board, then the answer has to be no. You do need to work this out with your wife though.", "NTA prioritize your own kids peace of mind, your wife is not considering the kind of chaos spoiled mannerless kids can bring", "NTA. Your wife is nuts. You're screwed", "NTA. Even if they were model, well-behaved children, that's a huge ask of you. If SIL isn't working, why does she need you and her sister to feed and house her children? Something isn't right.", "NTA.  Mary bullies your child.  You need to protect your child above all else.  \n\nQuestion:  For how long is SIL asking you to take them in?", "Info: would the niece and nephews be allowed if they were better behaved?", "NTA. Sit down with your wife. Point out that taking in 3 extra kids indefinately will strain the household. It's 3 extra mouths to feed, three extra beds to find, and 3 extra schedules to establish/folliw. Throw in the behavior issues, it will turn into a circus you can't escape. Sil and bil need to sit down together to figure out a plan that doesn't depend on dumping the older, unruly kids on other relatives.", "NTA. Stand firm.", "NTA But I think you should set boundaries with your wife.", "NTA, but your wife is trippin' hard. No way in hell would I allow spoiled kids in my house and terrorize my kids. She lost her damn mind......lost it!!!", "NTA. Your first priority is the health and safety of your own kids.

Protect them from your niece and nephews.", "NTA , OP . \n\nOffer your wife a talk but explain your bottom line is the welfare of your children so if her nephew and niece walk in , out you go with your kids.", "I can say I don't blame blame you for not wanting the headache. Why is a man with three kids need to be a stay at home dad? They probably barely make enough but, surprise, surprise, they having another kid. Looks like he's failed at parenting while being the stay at home. NTA", "NTA. Why can\u2019t your SIL watch her own children. She\u2019s not working. Is she in bed rest with her pregnancy? I would not take in the poorly behaved children, especially if any of them do not get along with my child(ren).", "Wait. Like stay permanently with you or for a night while SIL has a break?   \n\n\nNTA for not wanting them at your house. If you went behind your wife's back and told her sister no then there's some issues with that. Yall need to be in agreement and figure things out together.", "INFO - Are they asking that these children move in with you guys permanently or what exactly? And how do they not have enough time for the kids if she's not working?", "NTA taking on 3 kids and supporting them is a lot to ask under any circumstance. You have to put your family\u2019s well being first.", "NTA. your SIL is in a tough spot, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can expect you to take on all three of her kids.

I take it you would be financially supporting the kids as well? You said they are spoiled so I am assuming they would continue along thinking they can have whatever they want? Your SIL made the choice to have 4 kids. It\u2019s up to her to provide for them. Not you.", "NTA for not wanting the kids, but recommend having a conversation with your wife with an open mind before that gets worse.", "NTA. Tell your wife if she wants them then she can take 100% responsibility of them and provide all the finances for them. I bet she will decide not to take them in.

They are old enough to be in school. SIL is unemployed. Is someone ill?  Are they living somewhere unsafe?", "NTA. Wife should have discussed this with you before agreeing to such a big ask. So, to recap, they want you to take on 3 misbehaving children because....SIL now expecting a 4th child that they can't afford and was recently terminated from her job forcing stay at home BIL to get a job. Hmmm. What's wrong with this picture? Your wife is aware that their children treat your children badly. How could this ever be a good idea? And after baby is born, will you guys take that one in too? Unless they're being thrown out of the house they're living in, I would have to vote No way. If they are being evicted, then parents would be coming too, which apparently they are not. Sorry, but I think it's too big of an ask and could ultimately be the downfall of your own family.", "NTA\n\nThey can't take care of their three children so you can do it in addition to your own.

You know how they treat our children.

Spot on.", "Sounds like they dont have the money to take care of them not the time being an issue and shes pregnant, tbh i wouldnt even want to drop my kid off after being told no yet alone call and beg someone to take my children", "Then make that clear to the in-laws that the kids behaviour must improve or at least come to an agreement that when under your roof what you and wife says goes and will discipline if necessary", "NTA, oh hell no!

Wait it out and don\u2019t give into it is the best way to handle the situation. She will talk to you when she\u2019s ready.

I believe in everyone's right to their own reproductivity, but maybe SIL and BIL need to stop having kids.", "NTA and you need to ask why they are more important than the mental well-being of your own kids. Because she needs to see the kids would not be in a healthy environment with their cousins around.", "NTA. If she wants the niece snd nephew she can move out and take care of them. No way you should let them in your house to terrorize your kids, break stuff.", "I especially agree with the last statement above about setting clear boundaries if you decide to have them stay. Maybe even offer a \"trial period\" of 1 week to see how it goes. But definitely before agreeing to anything you would need to sit down and have a talk with the parents about the rules in your house that you will expect the children to follow and if parents complain that the rules are too harsh or unfair, the children immediately go back to the parents. You and your wife also need to be on the same page about these rules.", "100%. Your own kids come first. Every time."]}
