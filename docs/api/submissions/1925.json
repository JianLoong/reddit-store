But yes, your solution is certainly better than letting these kids run rampant in her house.", "I agree  ideally  she should  care for her own kids and let the nephews  parents  organize  themselves  unfortunately  from op s description  of her attitude  that doesn't  seem to be an option  at all", "NTA, YOUR children come first. End of story.", "NTA This is grounds for divorce. Maybe let her go to their place but absolutely don't allow those kids into your house.", "NTA. Protect your kids.", "NTA.  Stand firm.  You in-laws children aren't your responsibility, especially since the oldest one torments your own daughter.  If your wife wears you down, insist that your daughter has priority and that if there is any drama, they leave immediately and never return, even for parties or get-togethers.  Having family over that abuses your daughter would always be a big **NO** from me.", "98% sure you are NTA and you SIL is an awful human being for trying to dump her kids because taking care of them is too hard.  But, I need info.  Why is you SIL saying she can't take care of her own kids?  \n\nDoes she have multiple broken limbs? Is she in the hospital? Has she been abducted by aliens who are only allowing her to contact family for help with the kids?", "NTA \n\nSIL and BIL should\u2019ve thought about this before making the choice to have 4 kids. Imagine being such an irresponsible human being that you continue popping out babies despite not being able to afford the ones you already have. And then to expect other people to pick up YOUR slack? I have zero respect for people like your SIL. Zero. \n\nYou know who else I have zero respect for? People like your wife. She has a husband and kids who come first. When you get married and have a family of your own, they are your FIRST priority. Not your sister, not your brother, not your nieces and nephews. And your wife is about to put y\u2019all on the back burner to appease her sister? I don\u2019t like ultimatums, but with the blatant disrespect your wife has for you, I would straight up say \u201cit\u2019s either me and the kids or your sister and her kids.\u201d", "NTA This should be something you both agree to do, or if one disagrees it is off the table. I don't know why they are unable to watch their own children, and need you to have them move in? All the kids should be in school. There is also before and after care.\n\nI would never put my own children in a position of not feeling safe and loved at home. Your children should be your first priority. I would rather help SIL financially than sacrifice the peace of my own home.\n\nStand strong."]}
