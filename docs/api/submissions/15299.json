The bride and groom can certaianly decide on a dress code, and expect ppl to be on good behavior during the ceremony and reception, bc that's about basic respect for the occasion. But a haircut doesn't fall under those parameters.", "That's a great story!\n\nPlus it's a reminder that the only person who can ruin your wedding is you!\n\n If you take all that happens and adjust your attitude to what matters, it will be a day to remember regardless of what happens.", "Of course, that's how it works. The host gets to decide the parameters for the event and extend an invitation and any terms, and the guest gets to decide whether to abide or not go.

Or if someone invites you over at 6pm and you say sure, but I'm going to come at 4 instead, that's not ok. You either go as they say or you're not welcome. The choices are to abide by the hosts requests or decline the invitation. Going and ignoring the hosts' requests isn't a reasonable option.\n\nI agree the bride is awful and should not be dictating something like a haircut. But she did. OP knew she was not welcome at the wedding with that haircut, so don't go. It's not cool to tell the bride at her own wedding because you want to pay with the guests even if you don't care about the bride.", ">If someone invites you to a black tie event and you say, naw I'll just show up in jeans, that's not ok. Or if someone invites you over at 6pm and you say sure, but I'm going to come at 4 instead, that's not ok.\n\nThose are reasonable paramaters to make, though. They have to do with basic respect for the event at hand. Referring specifically to the dress code, which is a better comparison to a haircut than the time or arrival, a dress code exists bc functions have different levels of formality, and it's up to the organizers to decide that. But haircuts have nothing to do with respect or formality. How do you decide if a bob is more formal than a pixie cut? You can't. \n\n>The host gets to decide the parameters for the event and extend an invitation and any terms, and the guest gets to decide whether to abide or not go.\n\nThe host gets to decide things *to a reasonable extent.* By your logic, if the bride doesn't want anyone to have long hair, then she gets to say \"either cut it short or you don't get to come to the wedding.\" Do you see how unreasonable that is? Being a host doesn't give you total control over your guests' bodies.", "If a host is unreasonable, don't go. That is the choice. I totally agree with OP - if she doesn't want to change her hairstyle or wear a wig, she shouldn't do it. But she shouldn't have gone and ruined the day for the bride either.

Like, is this a common thing? \n\nThat's some misogynistic bullshit. \n\nMy wife has very thick, dark hair to the point where she complains of headaches 'cause of the weight of it, when it is long. She has been going progressively shorter, and even has had an undercut at times (Usually in the summer. Summers are very hot where we live.). Nearly every time she has it cut short, she has to cajole her hairdresser into cutting it short enough for her liking, and has even had hairdressers refuse to go as short as she wanted.

I have a long curly wig attached to a Klingon skull ridge, I would have worn that with a long, dress-code appropriate dress, and merrily wished them Qapla'", ">If a host is unreasonable, don't go.\n\nIf it was just one host, yes, I would agree. But at a wedding, there are *two.* Both hosts need to be in agreement about the rules-one doesn't just get to make up a rule and apply it to whoever they want without the other's agreement. When a bride and groom send out their invitations, they usually also sound out rules about the dress code, childcare, etc. Those are the rules. The bride texting OP on her own after the invitations and regulations have been sent and telling her to wear a wig is not a rule, it's a request. \n\n>But she shouldn't have gone and ruined the day for the bride either.\n\nA guest's haircut should not ruin the wedding for the bride. That's ridiculous, and if true, she's not mentally stable. She's marrying the love of her life with friends and family there to celebrate her. One person having a haircut that she doesn't like is enough to ruin all of that? Someone who can't acknowledge that other ppl are going to have personal atyles that she diaagrees with isn't ready for marriage-that's a serious level of immaturity that I can't even comprehend. \n\nIt's not like OP created a disruption, or wore white, or did something else to either derail the celebration or cause everyone to pay attention to her over the bride. Those things are absolutely resonable to get upset to the point of feeling like the wedding is ruined about. But a haircut?  Are you serious? \n\n>The bride is entitled to dictate the dress code, terms of the event and guest list.\n\nNo, the bride *and* groom dictate all of that together.", "Naw, you go with the lowest common denominator. Of one host says no, then you don't go. Frankly, if you can't go to the wedding in full support of the bride and groom, you don't belong there. How weird do you have to be to want to be at a wedding where the bride doesn't want you there? It's better to just not play into the drama and stay home with your haircut. Let the bride enjoy her day, and she'll enjoy it more without you, so stay home.", ">Naw, you go with the lowest common denominator. Of one host says no, then you don't go.\n\nAbsolutely not. The bride doesn't get to disinvite OP bc OP's not willing to go with a request she's making that *wasn't* a rule her and the groom agreed to make for their guests. The bride does not get unilateral authority to make up a rule for a specific guest-particularly one on the *groom's* side of the family-and threaten to cut them out if they don't comply. That's not how organizing an event goes, and it's certainly not how a marriage goes. Both agree on the rules, and both agree on disinviting ppl who don't follow the rules. \n\nIs the groom now allowed to make whatever rules he wants for her family? If he doesn't like that she has so many blondes in the family, does he get to message them after the invitations and dress codes have been sent and tell them specifically that they have to dye their hair or wear a wig otherwise they're out? Without consulting his wife about it? Do you see how illogical that is? \n\n>How weird do you have to be to want to be at a wedding where the bride doesn't want you there?\n\nUm, plenty of ppl go to a wedding to support just the bride or just the groom. Sometimes you don't know the other person well enough to really \"support\" them, or you think the relationship isn't the best but still want to be there for your family member. Why should the bride not wanting you to be there matter more than your family member wanting you to be there? Like, yeah, it'd be one thing if you were in the bridal party, but as a guest? \n\n>Let the bride enjoy her day, and she'll enjoy it more without you, so stay home.\n\nNah. If the bride can't enjoy her day bc someone has a haircut she doesn't like, she needs to get over it. She doesn't get to tell ppl what to do with their hair.", "NTA-I still can't get over the fact that she called a guest and demanded a specific style of dress and hair style. WHAT??  Best of luck to your cousin with that delight of a wife.", "NTA\n\nI kinda feel like the wedding wasn't that spectacular if the bride was focused so much on the hair of one single guest.  \n\nBest wishes to your cousin.
