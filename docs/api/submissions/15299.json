It being your wedding day doesn\u2019t automatically give you the right to demand such things of people. Grow tf up and accept that!

So you don't stand up for yourself by not putting on a wig and still going to the ceremony just because it's fun to attend a wedding. You stand by yourself by calling her out and saying she's shit and that she doesn't deserve your presence at her wedding because she's a mean and stupid person who doesn't deserve your attendance. THAT'S how you react to someone as stupid as that. You don't want me like I am ? Then you won't get me. But no, op decided to cover herself so her tattoos don't show, but buying wig would've gone too far... how is that different ? Covering her tattoos is not changing yourself and agreeing that the bride is partially asking something normal ?! No, that's still wrong. She didn't ask for a color, she asked her to cover up ffs. That's different. \n\nShe has the right to criticize the bride if she had not attended and had not followed even one of the 2 requests. And op did not do that. \n\nHow can op not think that someone as stupid to ask you to wear a wig wouldn't react in a dumb way as well for not following her requests ?! I swear your ingenuity is outstanding. \n\nI feel SO embarrassed by your comments"]}
