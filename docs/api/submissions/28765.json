This is a major party that was a lot of effort to plan. She wants you to throw it all away and screw over all those people invited because your friend can't seem to spend one evening away from the club. I can't say I care for her priorities.", "NTA. She was being selfish.", "NTA \n\nDo you really want to be friend with this person?  She sounds like she is not the same compatibility with you.  She likes to party in clubs, and you don't, is there anything else that keeps you friends?  It's ok for her to want to do these things, and it's ok for you to say no.", "You need a new BF that girl could care less about you or your feelings about feelings", "NTA Laura is a shitty friend though. Like you said, she could have gone out any ther time. I hope you had a great time and that everyone was able to come but her!", "You had everything set up and ready to go. Why would you cancel the party you planned and set up, at such a short notice? She doesn't have to attend your party if doesn't want to, but she can't get mad that you didn't change your plans. NTA", "NTA.  If you didn't have plans, I could see joining her, but this was something planned far in advance and wasn't just the two of you to consider.  There were other people attending! NTA, she is very selfish.", "NTA she was obviously the selfish one", "\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her but in that moment I thought her addiction with clubs and alcohol was getting out of hand I it was going to affect our friendship.\u201d\n\nYour friendship has run its course, and that\u2019s ok. It sounds like you have lots of other friends, so you\u2019re going to be ok without her. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your friend is rude. She committed to your party, then wanted you to cancel the whole party to go clubbing. So ridiculous.", "INFO: Was your initial response to the request to tell her that she was inconsiderate and selfish?  I don't think it was an asshole move on her part to suggest an alternate activity for your birthday party, but it should clearly be your decision if you wanted to change plans or not.  There's no reason to include insults in telling her you didn't, but NTA if she was pressing the issue rather than accepting your answer.", "Ok people may disagree but YTA:  Sounds like all your friend did was offer another possibility for your birthday outside of a party in a house.  Which makes sense seeing that now you are the drinking age.  Example here in the US most people do go out to a bar/club on their 21st because lets be honest you can have a house party at any age.  \n\nSounds like you got mad simply because she asked you and now youre going around telling people shes selfish.", "Ok. Sorry but soft yta. I think she was just suggesting and you can always say no and still party with your friends (her included) like you have planned. I know the suggestion was shitty but, it didn't feel like she was pressing to go clubbing. All you have to say is no, it's not like she put a gun on your head and forced you. \nI think for some reason you're already feel negative about her because of her addiction. If you still think she was inconsiderate for merely suggesting, I think you best of not being friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She said yeah and started naming all the reasons why canceling the party wasn\u2019t a big deal, she didn\u2019t wanna come even before I called her a selfish friend", "Good to hear, I hope you find a new friend that fits better for you.", "If she would\u2019ve suggested to celebrate my birthday at the club before I had everything already planned out and all the decoration, food and drinks ready I wouldn\u2019t have called her inconsiderate but come on, my birthday is one night a year and the club is open every single night, she knew how exited I was to spend the night my everyone singing karaoke, playing beer pong and eating cake and she also knew how much I don\u2019t like clubs cause I\u2019m quite an introvert and don\u2019t like spending hours with strangers", "I feel like it is always a good policy to start out interactions with people as charitably as possible.  If you can say no to something without insulting the person there's not a reason to insult the person.", "Also, her offer to go to the club after knowing everything was already prepared for the house party and everyone had confirmed? That was rude and also she wasn\u2019t friends with the rest of my friends so I doubt they would\u2019ve wanted to spend the night with her drunk at a random club, she was just thinking about herself, not me or the rest of my friends", "none of what you just said responded to me saying all she did was offer you a second option for your birthday.  \n\nAll you had to say was no thank you I rather have my party at the house instead of insulting her and getting angry that she had \"the audacity\" to offer you another idea outside of your own", "And I never judged her because of what I think is an addiction but she never got diagnosed or anything, I always tried to take care of her and when she got herself in dangerous situations because of it I always helped her and gave her advice not blaming her", "I know it suck, especially when I know you must have looking forward to your birthday. But you can't force someone (even your love ones) to want to be with you. So I think you just let her be, she wasn't a good friend if she can't at least appreciated your hard work pulling this party and have double the fun with all of your other friends. \n\nYou can still be her friend or not, it's your call. Happy birthday, girl.", "So again I absolutly think you are NTA because you wanted to do the thing you wanted to do for your birthday rather than the thing your friend wanted to do.  I just don't think she's an asshole for asking because guessing what people want instead is a bad way to go through life.", "My question to you is, did you expect me to last minute cancel my party, let all the food go to waste and go to the club with her instead of celebrating my birthday? She knew I didn\u2019t like clubs and she knew I had spent weeks planing my birthday, it\u2019s inconsiderate to say hey let\u2019s do what I want instead of what you want to do for your birthday", "Also again, the entrance ticket was hella expensive, was she gonna pay for my and my friends tickets?\nShe knew she was one of the only one who enjoyed clubs and still she decided to make me cancel my party and pay to go to the club with her", "Haha this was a year and a half ago, I am 19 now and I haven\u2019t talked to her since she decided to change her \u201cbest friend\u201d for the club", "Guessing what people want? She didn\u2019t guess, she knew what I wanted to do because we had been talking about how exited I was for weeks and she knew I hate clubs", "You do know you came here for people's opinions right.  The point of this isnt for you to convince people you're right.  So nah not answering your question. \n\nI repeat i think you're wrong here cause all you had to do is say no.  There was no need to insult her.", "Ignore this person, OP. Some people get on here just to play devil\u2019s advocate. You\u2019re NTA. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t sound like a real friend. She wanted you to give up your own birthday party in order to accompany her to a club that she went to all the time anyway. A real friend wouldn\u2019t do that.", "Oohh, sorry forget about the detail. I'm eating right now. But still, I wish you the best things in life.", "Has she been badgering you the whole time to have your party at a club instead?", "I said no, and didn\u2019t insult her in the first instance, I called her selfish when she said I was exaggerating for saying there was no say we were celebrating my birthday at a random club, I think you misunderstood my post darling", "Thank you, this is my first time posting on Reddit, maybe I didn\u2019t explain the situation correctly, and yes, she wasn\u2019t a very good friend, we no longer talk", "I don\u2019t understand what you mean, maybe because English is my second language, she knew I didn\u2019t like clubs at all, she wasn\u2019t friends with the other 8 people that were invited and she knew how much time and money I had put into this party, and she still insisted I forget about all the dedicating I put into it and just tell everyone hey, forget about my birthday let\u2019s just go to this random club with this person who you don\u2019t know and it\u2019s gonna pay for you (she hadn\u2019t even met some of these people in person before)", "You said she said you were exaggerating over being pissed.  And I agree, there is no reason to be pissed over a question", "My friends instead of going to a house party with a birthday gift and no money cause why would they?would now have to Uber to a random club with money to pay for themselves and leaving the gift at home cause what were they gonna do with it at the club?", "Situation 1: While your are planning your birthday party your friend is continually telling you that instead of having it at your grand parents house you should go to a club.  In that situation it's 100% justified to call her inconsiderate and selfish for not respecting your continually stated preference to have a party and your grand parents.\n\nSituation 2: You friend just once asks if you would want to go to a club instead of having the party at your grand parents.  Assuming your friend readily accepts a negative response instead of trying to convince you to change your mind there is no need to insult them by calling them inconsiderate or selfish.  It's a bit of an asshole move to do so even if you think they should know better than to ask.\n\nEvery job is easy when other people are doing it.  You shouldn't assume people are fully aware of the effort you've put into making plans because most of the time they aren't.  It's also somewhat reasonable for people to suggest you move a little outside of your comfort zone.  Have you been to that many clubs that it's outlandish of your friend to think you might want to go to one in celebration of being able to legally do so?  Could she have thought you distaste was because you were worried about being denied access or kicked out because you were underage?", "I don't know why you are replying to yourself instead of just including this in the initial reply, but I think you are exagerating the burden of going out to a night club by a meaninful margin.  You're acting like she suggested you fly to Vegas for the weekend or something.  Normal every day people go to night clubs all the time.  It's not some kind of rare luxury experience that is beyond the means of people such that one would assume people wouldn't go if invited or harbor some kind of resentment over being asked.", "It was neither situation 1 or 2, throughout the weeks and weeks of planing and putting together every detail of my birthday party she didn\u2019t suggest we do something different, she found out this party at this random club was happening the same night of my birthday and told me to change all of my plans less than 24 hours before my party, it was inconsiderate because she knew all the planning than went into my party because we had been talking about it, she knew I already had all the decorations, cake, cocktails etc and she also knew very well I didn\u2019t like clubs because I just don\u2019t like dancing with a bunch of strangers all night, I prefer a more personal night dancing and singing with people I know (my friends)", "This is my first time posting on Reddit, I\u2019m replying to my own comment to continue explaining instead of typing a huge chunk of text", "What bothered me is not the \u201cburden\u201d of going to the club, what bothered me was the inconsideration of all the planing, time and money that I put into my party and the fact that the rest of the guest had already confirmed they were coming, so changing the plans less than 24 hours before the party would\u2019ve meant, leaving the cake, drinks, rest of the food, decorations karaoke setup, beer pong setup all there for nothing, plus inconveniencing the rest of my friends who are majority not club people and making them pay quite a lot of money to come to the club"]}
