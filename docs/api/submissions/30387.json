Between 3A-3B if you\u2019re familiar with that scale. I\u2019m sure people with similar hair textures are used to the \u201cyou\u2019d look so pretty with straight hair! Why don\u2019t you straighten your hair?!\u201d One, I don\u2019t like straight hair on me. Two, it takes forever. Like 2 hours minimum for me, not just due to the thickness but I have long hair. I love my curls and am proud of them. I usually only get it blown out when I get a hair cut (rare) or if I go to a special occasion. \n\nOne of my friends, Elizabeth, has wanted me to straighten my hair for years. She\u2019s always offered to do it and I turn her down. She\u2019s never actually seen me with straight hair until this incident because I haven\u2019t cut my hair in the time I met her and I haven\u2019t had a fancy occasion to go to in that time.\n\nWell, last weekend Elizabeth got married and I was a bridesmaid. She told us we could do our hair and makeup however. I offered to get my hair blown out for the occasion as I knew that was the look she wanted for me. She was so excited. We were paying for our own hair and makeup, so I got mine done at a salon a couple of hours before we were due to meet up to get ready. It cost quite a bit. I didn\u2019t totally love it, but told myself I was doing it for my friend. \n\nI arrive at the venue and Elizabeth immediately gets a weird look on her face. She said she didn\u2019t like how it looked at all. I pointed out this is what she had wanted. I had shown her pictures of me with at straight hair in the past. She said it looked different this time. Keep in mind, Elizabeth\u2019s hair and makeup team said it would\u2019ve looked the same if they had done it, so it\u2019s not like the salon I went to messed it up or anything. \n\nElizabeth then said I needed to fix it. She wanted one of the other bridesmaids who was doing her own hair to curl it. I asked if she was going to pay for me getting it blown out. She said no. I said I wasn\u2019t about to be out the money I paid to get my hair done, especially as I already paid for the dress, my makeup and other various expenses. She told me I was being ridiculous. I had paid $150 for my hair and combined with everything else, it just adds up.\n\nEventually, her mom got involved, gave me the $150 and the other bridesmaid curled my hair. Elizabeth\u2019s mom told me I was being difficult and I shouldn\u2019t have argued with her daughter. She really laid into me, to the point where I was near tears.\n\nThe rest of the wedding went on fine. I was willing to let it go, especially as Elizabeth seemed to. However, I later heard from some of the bridesmaids that they felt I was being difficult. When I said I felt that Elizabeth\u2019s mom went too hard on me, they said I was being a brat and she was just trying to preserve her daughter\u2019s day.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699216221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17okxyg/aita_for_not_wanting_to_change_my_hair_unless_i/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's quite unusual for someone to be so fixated on another person's hair, especially to the extent that they would want it changed after you've already spent your own money to style it in a way that was previously desired. Your friend Elizabeth should focus on her own hair and preferences, not impose them on others, particularly not on such an important day as her wedding, which is already stressful.\n\n  \nYou had already accommodated her initial request at your own expense and time. It was not unreasonable for you to expect not to incur additional costs due to a change of heart on her part. It's good that her mother stepped in to reimburse you, but it's unfortunate that you were made to feel difficult and brought near tears on a day that should have been about celebration.\n\n  \nIt's important in any relationship to have boundaries and to be able to communicate when something isn't right for you, even in the context of a wedding.
