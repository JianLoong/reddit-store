You have to wonder how he acts when he\u2019s not out wrecking a nearly $170,000 car.", "You were the one responsible for the car full stop! Pay for the damage your actions caused.", "I didn\u2019t ask about the speeds you went.  I asked why you think a field is a track.  Because you seem to think that taking a Porsche to a field is the same type of action as her taking it to the track.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter what you told him.  That doesn\u2019t take you off the hook for the fact that it was damaged WHILE you were responsible for it.\n\nYou owe making her whole.  If you want to claim that he didn\u2019t have your permission to do what he did to damage the car and go after him to make you whole after you make her whole \u2014 that\u2019s up to you.", "This is obtuse dude. You're blame shifting to your friend whom YOU allowed to drive the car. You let him do it while you were responsible for it - you are responsible for the damage.\n\nP.s. do you notice how absolutely NO ONE on this thread says you are N T A ?\n\nYTA", "Nuh uh. You made the decision to take the car and you made the decision to let him drive it.

I know \u201cbecause she didn\u2019t ask\u201d is going to be your excuse for this, but your levels of sliminess are continuing to grow with every comment you post here.

You had to let him drive the car! You need to rethink your judgement skills.", "So why didn\u2019t you do either of those things?", "Aaahh. This seems reasonable for taking a race car four wheeling.", "You're too fucking old for that, man. Grow up.", "YTA. This is what you get for trying to impress your friend using your girlfriends car. Going to a hiking trail and driving through a field is not a special occasion so stop with that BS. You are an AH and an absolute idiot for letting your friend drive her very expensive car. Now it is time for you to learn an expensive lesson and hope it only costs you money and not your relationship as well.", "You hooned a low-body racecar around in a fucking field. Of course the suspension and undercarriage are messed up. Pay for the repairs and apologize to your girlfriend.", "You\u2019re 30. Learn how to say no.", "Own up to the things you did.

You borrowed your gf's sports car, let a friend drive it, let a friend drive it off-road.", "YTA here so you better consider footing that bill a lot harder and own up to the fact that you lied by omission and couldn\u2019t stand up to your pushy friend.", "It what universe is it understandable to take a sports car in a field?? Have you never seen a car commercial????", "If you didn\u2019t know, you shouldn\u2019t have done it. Fuck around and find out", "there\u2019s no considering here.

Besides that, it\u2019s entirely fair for you to pay the full bill because you shouldn\u2019t have let him drive it in the first place. There\u2019s nothing to consider.", "I didn\u2019t know that! What a bad idea. I have a 2020 and I love it. Love it!", "No I would if I caused damage, I can definitely pay for what she wants for the Porsche, I am still considering it. I was just wondering if it was right and whether she was just trying to push her maintenance bill onto me as it looked like a service report and not an accident repair report.", "Well, once \"his friend\" had destroyed the suspension with a few runs, I'm sure it loosened up.", "The road to get to there is paved. However my friend wanted to try the car in an empty field. I drove mostly on paved roads and he tried it in a field.\n\nIt just did not come up in conversation with her.", "i wish she finds this post and read thru his comments. i wanna know what she thinks bc the fact that he\u2019s cool with someone else driving her car but throws a fit over paying for the damage his friend did should make her rethink this guy.", "I think I will tell her the truth, come clean, pay for the whole bill and not just the parts she wants, and cut off my friend and explain to her. And hopefully make it up to her and hope she does not break up with me.\n\nShe already wanted me to cut off this friend for a while and does not like him.", "She might be, but I will make it up to her and not let it happen again and hope for the best.", "I can pay the whole bill even the parts she did not ask for. There is no way my friend would pay, he already owes me a lot of money he borrowed.", "She did not. I did not want to but he assured me he would not cause any damage and that my gf would never know and that the car was rated for that kind of driving. He knows more about cars than I do so I trusted him.", "Because he knew the answer would be no, and he figured lying by omission and going by the \"it's better to ask forgiveness than permission\" approach might mean he could argue his way into claiming all of this is her fault for not anticipating and articulating literally every possible scenario.", "My friend makes me do a lot of things I would not normally want to do and begs until he gets what he wants. He also owes me a lot of money he borrowed.", "I can afford to fix it. And I was reluctant to let my friend drive but he said he would not cause any damage and would be careful.

Its your fault.", "This is the hill you're choosing to die on.\n\nYou took a sports car onto a field when she only takes it to a track.  I feel like you saw the opportunity while she was gone to do this.\n\nYes, she is trying to push this onto you because it's your fault.  She can't file an accident claim because it doesn't fall under that category.  It would NOT be covered under that.  YOU took it out for a joyride and are now refusing to take accountability for it because you're a petulant child.", "INFO: Who was the friend and why was it so important to let them drive the car?", "As an example: few years ago, I woke up to find my car had been in a hit and run.  It was minor but someone scraped up the sides of it and drove off.  I was going to put it through the insurance to get it repaired but I'd be responsible for the deductible and my insurance would've gone up.  I was on the hook for all of it.  So I chose not to get the repairs until I had the money, which wasn't until COVID stimulus payments.  \n\nA few years prior to that, someone backed into my car and left their insurance information in a post it note.  THEY PAID FOR IT ALL.  \n\nThis is on you, bud.", "ITS NOT A MAINTENCE BILL ITS THE DAMAGE BILL THAT YOU CAUSED!!! YTA YTA YTAAAAA. I told this to my dad who has a Porsche he said this guy is just stupid or hates his gf, cause NO ONE who has a Porsche whould EVER take it to a field! Not just that you let a friend drive it without your gf permison. You betraed her trust, damaged her car and you think your inocent? Hahahahahhahahaha This has to be a joke.", "you obviously caused the damage.", ">It just did not come up in conversation with her.\n\nLying by omission, I see.", "so you not only took the car without permission but let someone else drive it on a field? did she consent to have your friend drive her car? you're obviously the AH like what the hell", "So you even let your friend drive it off road??? She didn't want you to drive it, and you let your friend?

How exactly does this friend force a grown man force you to do things you don't want to?", "Are you in middle school?", "Lol, blaming your friend because you let him exploit you. How can you be 30 years old? How?", "In what world is a Porsche 911 for offroading?", "AND YOU LET SOMEONE ELSE DRIVE IT?

Some SUVs and trucks go in fields.", "OMG    you let someone  else drive her car \nwithout  her permission ???\nGrow up and fix her Porsche \n\nYTA", "\"I did not know you could not take the car in fields\" what about that sentence seems fitting for a Porsche? The fact that you took her expensive sports car without permission and then you and your friend went and drove it in a field are you really thar obtuse?", "Nope, sorry. Don't buy that nonsense for one second. I know so little about cars that when I got stopped for an inspection for access to a military base recently it took like an hour and 5 MPs because I couldn't figure out how to open my hood. I am completely ignorant of anything mechanical and when I read that you took a Porsche off roading I thought \"what kind of person does something so stupid?\".

IN A FUCKING FIELD???\n\nJesus, dude...", "Then fix it and take responsibility for your actions. If you do not know the proper car of a car (especially one that expensive) you should not drive it.

You failed, because you gave way under pressure.", "Gee, I wonder why she's not very fond of him... Such a mystery.", "Probably because you act like a spineless idiot when you guys hang out.
