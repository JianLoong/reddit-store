She got upset and said that I should have known when I said car she meant only the Toyota as she always refers to the Porsche as the Porsche or the GT3. She herself only uses that car for special occasions and sometimes takes it to a track, and I thought our trip counted as a special occasion.\n\nShe got the car checked as she claimed it felt different, and came back with an incredibly expensive maintenance quote and told me I should pay for the suspension and undercarriage damage parts of the bill. I feel like she is being an AH I only used it for one day and I said I did not know maintenance was part of the deal and that I felt tricked.

I will pay the bill in that case maybe even the whole bill. I could afford it and I doubt my friend would pay for it.

Porsche does not fuck around with parts pricing or maintenance with any GT3.\n\nIf your bill from your girlfriend is less than $10k consider yourself lucky and indulge whatever she asks you to do to make up for this.\n\nShakes my damned head in amazement.\nWay to go Leroy Jenkins.", "I don't know too much about cars, aside from basic maintenance but even I would know not to take that kind of car into a field, esp for a joyride that your friend \"pressured' you in to. \\*eyeroll\\*\n\nYTA", "YTAH with s\\*\\*t for brains, this is a sport car, not an off-road vehicle.", "YTA. Stop giving excuses and just pay your GF", "How are you 30? You have the reasoning skill and self reflection of a 13 year old. Of course you are the asshole, who the fuck takes a Porsche to a field? What\u2019s next? Jumping over a fire pit in a Bentley? \n\nIf anything screams \u201eI don\u2019t wanna touch grass\u201c it\u2019s a fucking Porsche . YTA", "YTA - A Porsche GT3 isn't made for offroading. It's a road car. You may buy your own Porsche and soup it up to take it off roading or buy a Porsche SUV and then take your own car off roading. BUT NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S. Not without paying for the thousands of dollars of damage.\n\nMost people NEVER take their regular cars off road. Maybe to a dirt road, or into the grass to park, but most folks do not take their cars off pavement. \n\nI'm astonished that you think taking your ex-girlfriend's expensive sports car off road was ok. Stunned at your lack of awareness of what is appropriate with taking someone's car for a joyride and then allowing your friend is another layer of problematic behavior.", "This can't be fucking real. Reading your comments is an absolute trip OP. Hopefully you've gotten the point by now, but YTA", "YTA because this has to be made up as no one can be this stupid..", "YTA\n\nShe should sue you", "This can't be real, right?  I just can't fathom how spectacularly dumb you'd have to be to drive a Porsche in a field.  Let alone your girlfriend's Porsche.", "And it was the friend. She certainly didn't give his friend permission. Wonder how she would feel knowing that as well. YTA", "1. taking the Porsche when he knew that isn't really what she meant was an error in judgement\n2. taking the Porsche for a joyride was an error in judgement\n3. taking the Porsche for a joyride IN A FIELD was an idiotic error in judgement\n4. letting his friend drive her car (even if it had been the Camry) without her permission was an error in judgement\n5. allowing his friend to drive her Porsche without permission in a gd field was just an amalgamation of all kinds of bad judgement.\n6. refusing to take responsibility for what he did means he's an asshole in addition to being an idiot. I hope she dumps him", "It's such a lame cop-out as an adult to try and pin it on peer pressure rather than admitting he just wanted to take the car he knew she didn't intend for him to drive. Christ, I hope no one offers him crack cocaine behind the school bleachers! He'll be pressured to do it!", "And unless he owned that field, YTA for trespassing and damaging it as well.  Fields planted for the next year may look empty, but they aren\u2019t. Farmers regularly sustain damage to crops when people decide to off road on private property that doesn\u2019t belong to them.  If it\u2019s not yours, don\u2019t touch it - field or car.  And if you have permission to use it, don\u2019t damage it.  YTA so many ways.", "Words can't even express how furious I would be about this if someone took my sports car into a field. My ex took it down a dirt road one time and that alone made me mad. But a FIELD? OP should know better.", "I don't even like driving my Cadillac SUV into fields at concerts/fairs for parking.  I cannot believe there is someone on this planet that thought doing circles in a field with a Porsche was a good idea. Or even an idea.", "And let the friend drive it??", "Clearly she didn't know the part about you taking her expensive ass car off roading and letting someone else drive it.", "Those things have such low clearance.

No shot this dude ruined his girlfriends GT3 unknowingly.", "Hey, he left her enough gas to get to the gas station. Doesn't that count for something?", "My city has racetracks you can rent by the hour, so I assume most other cities do as well! Heck, even some of the smaller surrounding towns have tracks", "Apparently didn't even have the brains to take the Porsche to at least a car wash after.", "I'll not take that bet, I like to keep my money thanks", "Oh 1000%.\n\nThey will not be together long-term. OP is an idiot and probably harbors some level of resentment.\n\nTaking the Porsche for some fun and letting someone else without permission (and in fact someone the gf has expressed disliking) take the wheel is so disrespectful and juvenile.", "His friend seems to easily convince him to do things he shouldn't be doing. Apparently it was friends idea to use the Porsche instead of the Subaru, it was friends idea to drive said Porsche through a field and told him it would be fine, and it was probably friends idea to go hiking and leave the dogs with a dog sitter, if there even ever was a dog sitter.\n\nFriend has OP wrapped around their finger and is getting them to do shit they shouldn't and OP is defending friend. Hey OP, take it from me, your friend doesn't really care about you, they care about what you can do for them.", "*I did not know you could not use the car in fields (well I know but I thought one that was relatively flat would be ok if he drove slow)* \n\nYTA. Seriously??? You thought it was perfectly reasonable to take a Porsche essentially \"off road\". Where you high or drunk???", "YTA, for playing dumb about using a Camry vs Porsche. Again for not expressly asking permission when your GF supposedly booked a sitter for your trip out, again when taking a low riding, expensive vehicle out to mess around in a field.\n\nAnd yet again, for your edit where you imply your friend is partially responsible for the costs because you allowed him to pressure you into essentially stealing a car for a joyride. How old are you, 15?", "YTA- You damaged her car. Pay up.", "What I know about cars could fit in a dollar store pencil sharpener, and even I know that Porsches and joy riding in fields don't mix.", "And let someone else drive it!!", "And let someone else drive it, too.", "Yes, once.", "Yeah, goddamn this guy is supposed to be 30 and he's letting his mate peer pressure him into doing stupid shit. Plus the mf was there in the first place to pet sit his girlfriends dog and he goes and gets a random petsitter into his girlfriends house, like the hell man.\n\nHonestly I think the worst part for me isn't that he let himself get pee pressured, it's that he's using it as an excuse. If a partner was up front with me \"I'm sorry, I fucked up, I let myself get peer pressured into doing stupid shit, I'm genuinely sorry.\" depending on the situation we could work through it, but if they, a 30 year old, dead arse used being peer pressured as an excuse? I'd tell them to get fucked.", "So you might get a kick out this: [https://newsroom.porsche.com/en\\_US/2022/products/porsche-911-dakar-world-premiere-auto-show-los-angeles-30426.html](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2022/products/porsche-911-dakar-world-premiere-auto-show-los-angeles-30426.html)\n\nPorsche does have a decent history when it comes to off-road racing and for the 2023 model year, you can actually buy a 911 Dakar (an off-road spec similar to the car the OP flogged in a field)", "The media drive for the Dakar edition was only a couple of weeks ago, so it\u2019s probably not in customer hands yet. The Cayenne is actually pretty capable, not that most people are going to go bashing the skid plates of their $100k + SUV off rocks. \nEven though the GT3 has underbody cladding front to back, I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t break off the front lip. He almost surely messed up the alignment, scratched the rocker panels, and scuffed the rims. \nYTA dude.", "I know very little about cars and it had me cringing too! Even I know that's a horrible idea!", "Same", "And with only 5 words, you have summed up the thinking of everyone on this thread. \ud83d\udc4f", "Oh he definitely damaged the car. A GT3 has like 4 inches of clearance, you have to be careful going into a driveway. I had to reread the sentence about \"empty field\" because nobody could be dumb enough to drive a GT3 in a field.", "Oh, it's worse\u2026 He let his friend drive her Porshe because he \"always wanted to.\" This is firing squad behavior. Next we'll see him over on the /relationships sub Reddit wondering why she broke up with him.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Right? The fact that he seems to think that my friend \u2018pressured me\u2019 to drive it somehow makes him less of an ass? No, it just makes you a spineless and insensitive ass.

It\u2019ll be a crap ton harder to get him to pay the bill if she dumps him first.", "It was a special occasion after all.", "OP can't even take accountability for deciding to go joyriding in his girlfriend's Porsche. He has to blame his friend for pressuring him! WAHHH, what a meanie!\n\nThere was the very real possibility of getting into an accident. He isn't even on her insurance, so how would OP have explained that one? He still caused damage to her car and even now he isn't man enough to admit what he did. His girlfriend should collect the full amount of the repairs from OP, not cover half and expect him for the other half, then dump his sorry ass.", "This dude has Eddie Haskell vibes!", "I\u2019m still having trouble believing this is a true story. Can anyone really be this dense? I mean look at his other comments, he sounds like he\u2019s too immature to drive anything, let alone an expensive sports car. How in hell is it possible that a 30yo man didn\u2019t know that a  car with that ground clearance was not to be driven anywhere except a very even paved road?\n\nETA - Oh and the fact that he can\u2019t connect the dots between how the car is driven and subsequent cost of maintenance screams either troll or idiot", "When he said his friend convinced him to do it, my first thought was, \"Is your friend Ferris Bueller?\"", "The word \u201cmaintenance\u201d is doing Olympic level heavy lifting here", "If my partner used my 911 (actually any low riding sports car would be applicable) off road in a field I probably wouldn\u2019t have a partner any more.. break up material right there, proof they cannot be trusted!", "He\u2019s not clueless.
