I don't think I would be friends with her if it was just her and me, but we have a decent time together at group events.\n\nThe whole friend group is super gay, and one thing you might find surprising about queer people in their early/mid 20's is that a lot of them are very into astrology. I am absolutely not, having grown up in a hardcore Christian household, being strongly atheist now and not interested at all in finding new creative ways to judge people for how they were born. I don't even feel comfortable doing it \"for fun\" and have not participated when the group does astrology memes or asks me for my big 3 (they know my regular sign because they know my birthday, no control over that one.) When the conversation in the group chat goes to astrology, I just don't respond until the topic changes to something else. Everyone else just does it for fun or as a joke, but Danica really believes in it and is very defensive about it.\n\nI'm in the midst of some very stressful late bloomer dating right now, and Danica would often make negative comments on my matches based on their star signs, to the point that I stopped sharing screenshots of their profiles. I have told her not to make astrology-related comments towards me because it makes me very uncomfortable, and she has cut back considerably but still sneaks in borderline comments that she thinks \"don't count,\" like oh-so-subtly responding to something with just a crab emoji.\n\nAnyway, I couldn't hold it in anymore when she was talking in the group chat about looking for a new roommate, and how she turned someone down who was great except for being the \"wrong\" sign. She was being very smug talking about how she deserves to feel comfortable in her home and set boundaries for who gets to be a major part of her life, and I sent a message saying that it was absolutely terrible of her to deny someone based off of star sign, and that she was taking astrology way too far. She was big mad about that and responded very harshly \"Oh, I didn't realize we were judging people for their beliefs now?\" To which I replied, \"Well, your beliefs suck. It's immoral to treat people differently based on their star sign, it's meaningless bullshit that they can't even control.\" She said \"There's actually way more to it than that,\" and I said \"There's actually not.\"\n\nNow there's drama in the group as everyone else is picking sides, but the most popular take seems to be that I should have just stayed in my lane because it wasn't directed at me. I don't want to deal with drama, but at this point I would be perfectly happy if I never talked to Danica again and I'm hesitant to apologize.", "created_utc": 1683300195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138s0j9/aita_for_telling_my_friend_her_beliefs_suck_in/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s never going to change her mind about astrology, which - for the record - neither will you.

No. People can reject potential roommates for a ton of bullshit reasons that aren't discriminatory (like, cancers are not a protected class). I also think it's weird that you are so put off by it that you had to have a conversation with someone to stop bringing it up but okay!
