Nancy seems like she is a pro at making bad decisions that will impact the lives of others. I can\u2019t get over the fact that she decided to up and quit her job while pregnant and will likely be a single mother (nothing wrong with being a single mother - just saying that as there would be no other support coming into her household aside from whatever child support she gets, if she gets any at all). She has no way of supporting that poor babe at this point and doesn\u2019t seem to have any motivation to make the positive changes in her life that she need to make to provide a stable home environment for a little one. If she signed a lease (which I hope to god you had her do), tell her that she has to pay her portion of rent for the remainder of the lease or you will be forced to take her to small claims court. This will, unfortunately, end whatever friendship you have with this woman, but her actions have made it clear that she doesn\u2019t hold you and/or your friendship with her in high regard, so it isn\u2019t going to be a super big loss for you. People who are users/leeches will continue to act like a user/leech until someone shows them that there are consequences for their behavior. She is not your child, nor did you get her pregnant - nothing about her is your responsibility and she absolutely knows that. She is just hoping you\u2019ll let her get away with it at your expense.", "NTA.  She's using you.  Do not ever allow her back into your home once she's out.", "Nancy is taking full advantage of the fact you have some leeway with your landlords. She\u2019s also taking advantage of you. She might have family issues or be depressed because of the situation which her baby\u2019s sperm donor, but that doesn\u2019t entitle her to slack off and rely on you for everything.
