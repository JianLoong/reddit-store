Well, we found out her name from a social media post.\n\nIt\u2019s Layne. My husband and I were a little shocked, but we thought we would first say congrats and then ask what the nickname would be. They responded Lanie. We stated that it was really close to what we named the baby we lost (super chill - not rude or confrontational) and the wife got ticked and ended up blocking us on social media over it. The BIL just said they aren\u2019t the same names so he doesn\u2019t understand why we are upset. They knew her name. They knew her nickname and what we called her. I just don\u2019t understand how they don\u2019t hear how similar Delanie (Lanie) and Layne (Lanie) are.

They were just 100% assholes in everything they did re this situation.", "Yeah, I feel like this may be a situation where you\u2019d have to have gone through the loss to truly understand what I stab in the heart it was. That\u2019s the one thing I keep telling myself. My SIL hasn\u2019t had that loss so she doesn\u2019t understand.", "We are NC at the moment. But mainly because this was the final straw.", "Yes thank you! I hear Delanie here and there and I have to deal with that. But, to have another one with the same last name that will be at all the holiday parties and just normal family events is another. I just wish we didn\u2019t find out on Facebook with all their other friends", "And we found it out from a Facebook post? That was odd too. Forgot to mention that.", "Yeah I appreciate that everyone thus far has been respectful and I am certainly open to differing opinions but it IS a super weak defense. Of course we don\u2019t own the name. But just because you can do something doesn\u2019t mean you should. And a little respect from the in laws would have went a long way", "They weren\u2019t told the name either and they were also blindsided.", "We will be NC for a while. This was yet another issue we have had with them.", "Thank you so much", "There are millions of names out there. It is 100% an asshole move to choose one of the handful of names that sound like your brother\u2019s dead baby.   \n\n\nlike, yeah ok it\u2019s not illegal but it\u2019s insensitive af \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, OP", "I certainly didn\u2019t expect them to change the name. But a heads up would have been slightly more appropriate", "Correct, she doesn\u2019t own the name Lanie. But it\u2019s definitely an Asshole move for BIL and SIL to use that name. They\u2019re family. They\u2019re fully aware of the heartbreak associated with that name. That\u2019s clearly why they waited to announce the name until after birth. BIL and SIL are the assholes here.", "Yeah, but the BIL/SIL (not sure which is related to OPs husband) KNEW their BROTHER lost a newborn named Lanie. Then NAMED another baby Lanie? And conveniently hid this from everyone beforehand counter to their typical baby naming MO? This is nothing other than calculated. \n\nEvery fucking milestone with this Lanie will be a calculated slap in the face to this poor family. First steps, first words, first grade, first love, drivers license, graduation, etc.", "Came here to say this. I have multiple cousins with variations of the same name in multiple combinations.\n\nThat being said, I understand the grief. You have my deepest sympathies.", "Yeah families have very similar names, in my family my deadname well more like my dead middle name was a shared middle name because about 90% of the women/afab people have the same middle name in my family.", "I wouldn\u2019t say angry. My husband and I are pretty passive people and we definitely wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Like, maybe the nickname would be Lana or maybe they would encourage no nickname? Maybe it was a family name from the other side of the family? I guess I just expected an open like of communication.", "Yeah, you can\u2019t control what other people name their kids but if you\u2019re the BIL and SIL in this situation you can decide not to name your baby a name so similar to your brother\u2019s stillborn daughter. They knew this would be painful for Op and her husband, which is why they kept it to themselves. There are millions of names and they could have chosen something different easily and they didn\u2019t. NTA, OP.", "Considering it was a stillbirth, there is no way to know whether or not the nickname would stick. Which is mostly why I figure this is so hurtful. They never even had a chance with her. She is forever Lanie, at the moment she arrived and left. \n\nOP doesn't own a name, but the in laws don't seem to own a shred of empathy", "It\u2019s not really helpful. Their daughter\u2019s nickname was Lanie. They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to find a different one that suited her better.", "They did it on purpose. They knew what the name ment to OP. OP is 100% NTA, and the BIL and SIL are huge assholes.", "It wasn\u2019t in honor. They would have said something before or even when we questioned it.", "NTA. Are you being serious? They took the name of their dead child to use as their own. It\u2019s disgustingly rude and disrespectful", "Ya. The fact that they were super secretive about it, they knew it was wrong and an a-hole move. \n\nI get that people don\u2019t get to gatekeep names but the whole family knew the name and the hurt that has on your family. I could never do something like that... not even on my worst enemy. \n\nNTA, OP\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I cannot even fathom the pain you went through... and still go through because that\u2019s not something you can just forget. *hugs", "What is the usual relationship dynamic between you guys and them? It is such an odd choice for them to make. I can't tell if it may have been done out of thoughtlessness, as some kind of weird jab or power move, or was a true mistake somehow- at any rate, they should have known better, no doubt.\n\nNTA for sure, you were very polite about confronting them. I'm just baffled by their possible motives.", "They made a decision and didn't want any pushback. Just more evidence that they knew the parents would be upset as well. They wanted the name and didn't care who was hurt by it.", "I'm not even sure an honorary thing would be good.  Stillborn births inflict a kind of pain that can't be described.  It's a huge cheat and you basically hate the entire world and everyone in it for a solid amount of time.  And the name that you have given that child (yes I do consider a full grown human being a child even without that first breath of oxygen), is so special in its own way.  I would never talk to my relative again if they chose that name or nickname variant of.  Especially if once pointed out they double down and act appalled like they're within their right to have a living child with the SAME NAME as if they're somehow better than you.  Ugh.  Hard pass.  And absolutely NTA.  I hate your family for you.", "Any mother understands enough to know that *you do not do this.* She knows what she\u2019s doing and she doesn\u2019t care.", "No. I think any normal person who has had a child understands that loss... Every parents worst nightmare. Both of your sils are monsters.", "I've never had kids (various reasons), but my mum's first pregnancy that went to nearly full term ended in the stillbirth of my brother. This was several years before I was born, but I still know how much of a loss it's been for both my parents. You don't have to break a limb to know it hurts, & you don't have to have experienced a horrific situation to have empathy for those that did.\n\nYour BIL & SIL are TA for knowing this would hurt, not just you, but your husband (presumably 1 of the 2's brother ffs) & the rest of the family that Delanie's loss has affected. I wasn't even alive when my brother was born, but the loss has still affected me in a lot of ways, so I'm sure the loss has affected multiple members of both yours & your husband's family & friends.\n\nChoosing such a similar name (heck it's pretty much identical, especially with the nicknames), with no prior discussions, heads up, nothing is cruel beyond belief, & both your BIL & SIL know this, which is why they hid it & then blocked you when the subject was raised. If they try to claim that the name is in tribute to your daughter, then they should know that any tribute naming of children that could cause pain & upset, should always be discussed with those it will affect, especially as your loss is so recent & raw.\n\nIdk where I'd go from where you are, but know that protecting yourself from any further harm, is not a bad thing, if you do decide to go lc or nc, for even a short time. Give yourself whatever room you need to process this situation, prioritise both yours & your husband's wellbeing for however long you each need. Sending gentle hugs \ud83e\udd17", "I've never gone through such a nightmare.\n\nI am, however, a mother.\n\nNo woman calling herself a mother would do this.\n\nThis is not a casual misunderstanding.\n\nThis is an attack on the memory of your child.\n\nThis is a deliberatly and maliciously cruel act done for their own delight.\n\nIt's monstrous.", "She may well not understand the depths of a loss such as yours and your wife\u2019s. It is still entirely unacceptable. She should still have enough love, compassion and empathy to know that what she did was wrong. And she does know that! They wouldn\u2019t have kept it a secret all of a sudden otherwise. I\u2019m enraged on your behalf. I am so sorry your family has added more stress and devastation to you and your wife.", "I don\u2019t blame you. I would do the same. That would be it for me. I hope you and your husband are doing okay and send you my love.", "That was probably by design, once the name was public they thought you wouldn\u2019t be able to ask them to change it", "This situation is so unbelievably disgusting and I\u2019m beyond sorry for you. Your BIL and SIL are most certainly HUGE AH\u2019s and if I were in your shoes, that would be the end of the relationship. To me this seems unforgivable and so heartless of them.", "They can name their kid whatever they want, but that doesn't mean it wasn't an AH and heartless move. Specially how they didn't even consult with you and played dumb. \n\nMy dad lost his brother when he was young, and when my eldest brother was born, my parents asked my grandma if they could name him as my uncle - to honor him. She was thrilled. If she had said no, they would obviously not have done it. I have my grandma's name as middle name (we repeat a lot in my family as a way to honor). \n\nThe key here was that they knew how unkind they were being and didn't care. That's beyond mean.", "I would go NC forever.", "That\u2019s exactly my issue. I have PTSD from the stillbirth and now I have to hear about their Lanie all the time.", "Yeah but were any of them named by their parents after their parents siblings dead babies?", "That's fair, but nothing in this post indicates that the name was a widely used name for the family.", "But how do you know that? There's more than one way to honor someone, they didn't have to make a whole song and dance about it nor do they have to directly tell you. \n\nAlso, you'll have to forgive me but I have a feeling there was more to this convo between you and your in-laws than you've let on. You've avoided the main question of my comment, you made it sound like you made one \"super chill\" comment to your SIL and she threw a fit, but now its a case of you \"questioned\" them? Kinda starting to sound like you went in with the intention of rocking the boat.", "[deleted]", "I don\u2019t think at all that it was purposeful. I assume they liked the name and didn\u2019t want any objection and reasoned themselves into believing that they were different.", "You don't even need to be a parent to know that to do this is beyond awful.", "Not even had a child. I don't have children and I won't be having any. Its absolutely disgusting to do that to someone, its not human.", "I like your perspective. All it would have taken is for them to have respectfully consulted OP and her husband.", "Exactly! They knew it would hurt- that is common sense.", "I am so sorry, OP. I truly wish you the best and hope that you and your partner are in therapy or grief counseling to deal with this fucking doozy.", "My sister\u2019s first grandchild was named in honor of the son she lost when he was 13. She absolutely was in favor of this and loves her son\u2019s memory carried in such a way.", "Actually, yes.  A couple of infant deaths (one by SIDS and one stillbirth) were in the mix.  We all grieved with the parents but the parents never got territorial about names.   In fact, the parents loved having the names used over and over.", "I guess I should have included that the name was just a name that I liked when I was a teenager. There is no history or meaning from my husband\u2019s side of the family. I can\u2019t speak for my SIL, although I feel like she would have said something back when we had our baby", "Ah okay, my apologies. This was indeed glazed over on my original post, but only because it\u2019s an entirely different topic and I was trying to not write a novel and rabbit trail. \n\nMy husband was the one who was talking to his brother. He just said congrats and something along the lines of \u201cwill you be calling her Lanie\u201d? His brother responded that it would be Lanie since all of their kid\u2019s names thus far has had \u201cie\u201d nicknames. Then my husband said that it was hurtful because it\u2019s the same nickname as our baby. And his brother commented that he didn\u2019t understand because they are different names and that was that. \n\nHis wife then went on to block us. What was left out is that we were already having issues with them. My husband and his brothers are in a group chat. His one brother likes to get really drunk and send super homophobic, racist and misogynistic texts along with screenshots of very graphic pornography. We have 5 kids, so my husband asked him not to send that kind of stuff where the kids will see it and his brother seemed offended over it. And my husband didn\u2019t want to be involved with the other horrible stuff and I will give examples since you seem to like the details. \u201cGay people should go back to hiding in rest area stalls\u201d, \u201cLesbians just need warm squirting cock\u201d, and \u201cwomen who have been raped definitely liked it\u201d. \n\nSo, I feel like they just felt attacked over my husband not wanting to be included in those conversations.", "Obviously nobody owns a name. This isn't a legal ownership sub, it's an asshole sub. \n\nI swear to God people on this page intentionally act like they've never heard of living in a society or what it entails.", "The kindest and most charitable explanation I could think of, without knowing what they are like personally of course, is that they kind of picked up the name through \"subliminal advertising\" by hearing it said by you guys so many times over the years. And they are not self-aware enough to figure out why they liked the name or realize where they picked it up from. This would be my assumption if they were normally decent but checked out or clueless people. It's probably what I would tell myself in your shoes to give myself some peace of mind. But they really should have known better and, failing that, someone else in the family should have given them a hint.", "They probably liked the name and knew there would be if not an objection, then at least comments with the family. So they avoided it instead of mentioning it to you. The over reaction to your comment makes them sound really defensive, and like they anticipated a fight.", "I'm glad she was given the heads up and opportunity to be in favor of it! That's the distinction between someone honoring a life or blindsiding grieving loved ones", "That's wild, and hasn't been the experience in my or many other families. \n\nI assume the names were given the go ahead by the parents who lost the original child name? There's a difference between blindsiding and honoring.", "Jesus christ, someone save those kids from being raised by a freak like him", "\\]  If you get misgendered, you probably aren\u2019t doing that great at   \nrepresenting that gender.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwith shit like this in your comment history your one to talk", "So this naming business is really just in the backdrop to this racist an homophobic rhetoric his brother spews. And you feel like they've named their child Layne, just so the nickname of the child is the same as the nickname of your late daughter, in an attempt to get back at you and your husband because he didn't want to be involved in their conversations? Beggin your pardon but that seems like you're looking for nefarious intent where they might be none, also it seems kind of a reach and really unlikely that they've named their child out of some sort of spite? \n\nYou already aren't the biggest fan of your in-laws, you're not going to be looking through what you'd call a \"positive lense\" in regards to what they do. Is it not possible they simply picked a name they liked and it's unfortunate it shares a shortened nickname as your late daughter?", "Good thing for you it's an asshole sub.\n\nGood thing for me, too.", "I imagine they felt awkward bringing it up which unfortunately led to more awkwardness. But I doubt they meant it as a slam to OP or her child.", "This! My best friend named their child after ours in honor of mine. It was her exact name, but they talked to us about it. So of course we don\u2019t own the name - That seems to be said a lot - I\u2019m going to hear the name here and there from other people having it and that\u2019s something I have to deal with. But, to have someone so close in the family do that with no heads up was startling", "I honestly don't remember how it went down as it was several years ago.  I do remember my mom talking about the infant deaths and knowing that the names were reused/repurposed.\n\nBut I have noticed that people are getting more and more territorial about baby names after a death.  It is a sad way to live, IMHO.", "I guess I don\u2019t consider that rude, but I can see without context that it could come across incorrectly, so I apologize. I am open to your take on the comment. \n\nIf I see a person dressed as a female, I respectfully call them a female. Same with male. If you accidentally get misgendered, I feel like people should stop getting so triggered by it. Of course, unless they mean it disrespectfully. I am really big on the fact that there are very very bad people out there. Like, they want to hurt gay/trans (etc) and I hate seeing people fighting over semantics when they could simply be educated and become an amazing ally.", "After some thought, I want to add that context matters. That comment was about a person who was pissed because they got called sir by a server and was deciding not to tip them. They were male appearing. They didn\u2019t correct the server. They just decided they didn\u2019t deserve a tip. Thats shit. Servers don\u2019t get paid enough. They could have just said something you know?", "No I don\u2019t think it was out of spite. The issues I spoke of above were recent. And perhaps they did just like the name. Maybe they are a big Gilmore Girls fan, idk? My point you seem to be missing is that my husband and I feel like they could have talked to us about it.", "If they aren\u2019t close enough to ask permission for something this important, they aren\u2019t nearly close enough to \u201chonor,\u201d the child who is gone.
