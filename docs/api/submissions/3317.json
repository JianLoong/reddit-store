Well, we found out her name from a social media post.\n\nIt\u2019s Layne. My husband and I were a little shocked, but we thought we would first say congrats and then ask what the nickname would be. They responded Lanie. We stated that it was really close to what we named the baby we lost (super chill - not rude or confrontational) and the wife got ticked and ended up blocking us on social media over it. The BIL just said they aren\u2019t the same names so he doesn\u2019t understand why we are upset. They knew her name. They knew her nickname and what we called her.

I can also see that for them, the name is an idea not a person. I'm not sure anyone can fully understand your loss if they haven't lived through it.
