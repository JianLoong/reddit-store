Well, we found out her name from a social media post.\n\nIt\u2019s Layne. My husband and I were a little shocked, but we thought we would first say congrats and then ask what the nickname would be. They responded Lanie. We stated that it was really close to what we named the baby we lost (super chill - not rude or confrontational) and the wife got ticked and ended up blocking us on social media over it. The BIL just said they aren\u2019t the same names so he doesn\u2019t understand why we are upset. They knew her name. They knew her nickname and what we called her.

However, my mother had a miscarriage several years before and was planning on naming my lost sibling Aiden.\nMy underdeveloped brain knew that it\u2019d be unwise and hurtful so I picked a different name, it\u2019s really not that hard to decide on a different name if you know that it\u2019ll hurt someone, even if you aren\u2019t sure, ask and if it turns out it would hurt them, then pick another name.", "That's the thing I just don't understand, and I'm baffled every time I see a post on this topic. It's just not that weird to me to use the name of a deceased relative. No one is actively being called that name now; it's not going to be confusing to anyone. How many generations or degrees of separation in OPs family are blocked off from using the name? How much time must pass? How similar does the name have to be to cross the line? What is the actual harm being done \u2013 any reminder to the parents of the lost child? Trauma of a loss can last a long time, but that doesn't mean everyone else should have to tiptoe around it forever, does it?

It almost seems like the name choice was deliberate to throw it in your face. In short, your SIL/BIL basically are saying the same thing the last sentence of your post and are acting like you've gotten too much attention for your loss, so they will steal it.", "NTA, there\u2019s so many names out there, I mean SO MANY. The normal decent human being thing to do is to have an immediate veto on names close (phonetically or etymologically)) to the ones of a relative\u2019s child (especially one that passed).

My B and SIL lost their third child and when I've heard the name in broader circles it hurts. So I can't imagine what it would be like if a family member chose a similar name.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. This is so disrespectful of them. They clearly are basically the same name and for them to not even acknowledge that, I just can\u2019t imagine how you must feel.

Secondly, I come from a culture where it is extremely common to have cousins share a name so usually the naming drama makes no sense to me. HOWEVER, and this is a big one, if any of my siblings had experienced such a loss, I would never DREAM of going anywhere near the name they had chosen for their baby, even if the name had a huge sentimental value since we often name for close family.

You are fully justified. NTA", "NTA\n\nAt first I thought they were going to say that it was a tribute to the love your families share for your Lanie. My family has done it for generations.

Good riddance.", "If you were telling them they shouldn't be using the name then YTA.\n\nMaybe they liked the name. Lots of people have the same name and nickname. Maybe they didn't want to tell you because they knew you would react in this way.", "That is terrible of them. NTA. To carry a baby full term just to burry it is so heartbreaking. I think its a huge difference to a miscarriage. I would also name it and expect everyone in the family to not use the name. Also this kid will find out about her cousin, who died, and it will definitely feel weird for her to be named alike. What an awful idea and what a weight to put on the baby.", "NTA.

That shit is SO weird! Is it for attention maybe? I just can\u2019t imagine trying to repeatedly throw another persons grief in their face for a name.

Which makes it even worse in my opinion because WITH having children already she should definitely know better.\nI mean, people who have the tiniest bit of empathy and don\u2019t even have kids would understand and don\u2019t use the (nick)name. Or would at least have asked beforehand and not gone through with it if OP & husband weren\u2019t okay with it like in this case. I really feel for OP and her husband. And despite the NC, I am afraid that just this having been a conversation had, with family no less, will always stay with them as added hurt. The NC will help a bit, but it will always hurt. Because they will always be aware not having them as family members anymore / not having contact with B(IL) and S(IL) anymore (I wouldn\u2019t be able to consider them family anymore, which in this case might not be that bad. But you never forget that they once were/felt like family). And the reason why will never be forgotten. BIL & SIL really are massive AH\u2019s without the teeny tiniest bit of empathy. I can\u2019t believe they did this. And so knowingly! They didn\u2019t keep the name a secret this time around for nothing. And on top of it having to find out the name through Facebook. This just makes me furious beyond\u2026. And so incredibly sad for OP & her husband. As if the stillbirth didn\u2019t hurt them enough already.

I think it's coincidentally hurtful because OP feels like they're taking away a special thing she picked for her deceased child. But names are not a single-use item, so it doesn't actually take anything away for someone else to use it now. If OP is still sensitive just to hearing the nickname at all, thats understandable I guess, but it means they need to go back to therapy, not control their family's choice for the new child.", "Just how were they going to avoid OP's reaction?   Did they plan to keep the baby's name secret from OP for their entire lives?", "\nI understand it probably hurts feeling like they stole your name but think of it this way - your angel inspired that name for them!

They *knew* it could be an issue and instead of choosing something else - they chose a route of conflict and harm. It makes it on purpose. And, please don't gaslight yourself on this. Their impact matters more than their intent.

But a common courtesy if it's in the same generation is to ask the closest relative, especially a parent. Even if it's just a close name which shares a nickname in this case. It's the potential difference between honoring a name or harming the relationship with the family member(s). Not even acknowledging the children would share a nickname, which was commonly known in the family, could be seen as either carelessly or deliberately ignoring the OP's grief and loss. And potentially every time OP sees this child they'll be reminded of their own loss and the snub. It could cause a great deal of tension in a family.", "Lulu. Boy or girl. Call this new baby Lulu and be done with it! Lol", "It could cause a great deal of tension in the family only if OP insists on making everything about her grief, which I think the rest of the family is allowed to move on from in the 8 whole years since, even if she hasn't. If they just accepted the new baby's name, over time the association becomes less painful, and then you simply think of the person in front of you, not immediately dive into ruminating on your loss. \n\nI have some past traumas, including an infant death in my family (my sibling when I was 12), and I'm not automatically re-traumatized whenever I hear the same names as people associated with those traumas. They're different people. You can think of one person without thinking of another person with the same name. So again, I don't see the actual harm to OP? It's not even the exact same name, and there is no living child using the similar one she had picked. I just don't think their loss permits them to ban some names from being used by the family. Yes, they had a name picked out, and they sadly didn't get to use it, so now let someone else use it (or a similar one). The new parents are not taking anything away from them or invalidating their experiences by choosing a similar name. Just seems like a strange taboo to me", "Once the name is on the birth certificate, it's a lot harder to change it. Before that, it's just a decision and no paperwork."]}
