Do either of you know that bisexuality exists? This is genuinely not meant as a criticism - a lot of people grow up only seeing examples of gay and lesbian people. Bisexual representation is fairly lacking (though starting to get better). This is something that caused issues for me growing up. I had crushes on lots of boys when I was very young, but had my first crush on a girl at 12/13. Because I already knew I liked boys, I convinced myself that I just wanted to be that girl's friend. It took my several years after that to come to terms with the fact that I like both men and women.", "NAH - I'm a mom and stepmom of 4 kids total. I grew up in the 80s in which labels were definitely an important way to categorize the world around us. It was either \"gay\" or \"straight\" or \"bi\".  It's a confusing time for a lot of people, including your mom.\n\nTo your mom, living and in  love with a guy = gay. To you OP, it sounds like you don't want any label yet and that's okay.\n\nIt seems like every other week my 16 year old daughter comes home and tells me a friend of hers I've known for 12 or so years is not \"Trina\" anymore, they are now \"Keith,\" and to stop \"dead-naming\" them. And I apologize profusely as I either forgot or didn't know, and I'm honestly just trying to keep up. OR, so and so is \"not straight, that's not her boyfriend, that's her best friend, they just make out some times!\". And I apologize and try to move on.  I've let all our kids know that it's okay whatever they identify as, that we love them and support them regardless. When I ask our boys \"hey do you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend at the moment?\" the boys guffaw and say \"only girls mom!\" I'm telling you this OP to try and help you understand that us dinosaurs are trying our best and trying to make sense of world in which labels are VERY different to when we grew up.\n\nYour mom is trying to make sense of things. I fully understand that you don't want the label of gay at all yet and that to you, right now, love is just love. To your mother, she is still living in her world where a man falling in love with a man = gay. I honestly believe that she was just trying to help you be okay with the label, thinking you were  just acting out of a need to try to soften the news by saying you weren't sure and didn't need that label.\n\nI know it's hard, but I'd reach out to her. I'd tell her I love her, and that I'm just not comfortable or sure about any label just yet. And thank her for the support. This was just her way of coping, and believe it or not, trying to help you be okay with the label.\n\nWe still live in a very heteronormative world, despite all the progress we've made. Since you dated girls for years, she had probably convinced herself you were \"fully\" straight. Give her a break on this one.  \n(edited for grammar)", "NAH\n\nI feel like your mom was trying to be supportive in the only way she knew how, which is apparently to copy the \u201cI\u2019ve known you were gay since you were 3\u201d trope in tv/movies. Which is fine because she is trying to navigate uncharted waters here, just like you are.\n\nI also feel like you blew up in a moment of frustration because you\u2019re not entirely sure you\u2019re gay and she\u2019s here telling you that you are. I can see how that would feel insulting. \n\nI feel like there is no fault here. You\u2019re all just trying to figure it out. Emotions are high, everyone is doing the best they can. \n\nGood luck to you, be patient with yourself.", "NAH\n\nBut you're not straight.

You can be bi, pan, sapio, etc\u2026 I suggest doing some reading as you both continue to work through things. There are some amazing books out there. I\u2019m a school librarian and got a book that was an introduction to all sorts of different labels. I\u2019ve had multiple students tell me that one or more of them resonated with them. They just hadn\u2019t really heard them before. It\u2019s okay to take your time and explore. It\u2019s also okay to change labels as your thoughts change.", "NAH.

You're sleeping with another dude hence you can't be straight. Mom also needs to look up bi in the dictionary.", "NTA... Human sexuality exists on a spectrum and where we all fall on that spectrum is incredibly unique. If we are all being honest, few of us will fit neatly into any one label.\n\nI'm a guy. Technically I guess I am bi. I've been sexual with men and women although I am only physically attracted to the feminine. It was confusing in my younger years. I always wanted girlfriends, but did have one guy friend that I was sexual with... we never kissed, it was just about getting each other off. When I started dating girls, I didn't get with another guy for over a decade. When I went away to college, my friend group included lots of lesbians, and for some reason, I became the one guy that several of them wanted to experiment with. I don't present as feminine at all... I'm a big burly bearded bear-looking guy, but they all said that I felt safe and familiar to experiment with... it became a running joke that I was just a lesbian born with a strap-on. After college, I moved to a tourist town known for being a gay hot-spot. I dated tons of women there and had plenty of gay friends. Eventually, a couple of these gay friends hit on me and would offer to \"take care of me\" with no need for reciprocation... but once it started and I got turned on, I would happily reciprocate. The sex was great, as long as I didn't pay too much attention to the fact it was with a guy and I could never bring myself to kiss. Eventually, I had a few experiences with trans women, and it felt perfectly natural. I was just as attracted to them and wanted to kiss and make out with them as much as any CIS woman, regardless of what was between their legs. Conversely, I cannot imagine myself wanting to make out with a masculine-presenting trans man even if he had a vagina.\n\nI detail all of this to show how incredibly individual we all are on the delicious spectrum of human sexuality and gender expression. Don't worry about labels. Love who you love and be loved the way you want to be loved. As long as it's honest and consensual, there is no wrong way to love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add... Your mom does sound like she is trying to be supportive which is way more than many kids get in these situations. Older generations have a harder time comprehending the \"spectrum\" of human sexuality. My mother always said she could understand gay men, but not lesbians. In her mind sex = penetration, so she just couldn't figure out what lesbians actually did. I'm sure her response is more frustrating because you are still in the process of figuring this out. You may have to be the patient one here in helping to educate her. It would be way different if she was being a bigot... this just seems like she's almost trying too hard.", "So you\u2019re here complaining because your mom thought you were gay? Why does this upset you?", "YTA - sounds more like you wanted her to jump with joy and feel really excited that you are in a same sex relationship. Maybe you thought she would set off fireworks, hire a band. She sounds quite supportive, all your family sound understanding.", "NAH \n\nI think how you felt about the support she was offering was irritating.  But there's a good chance your mom is just drawing from her experience with queer friends she had growing up.  The coming iut as bisexual, or saying you still like girls was something that often happened a lot with gay guys who were gen x or elder millennials. It's something I did.  \n\nI feel in her own way, she was trying to support you in the way that was coloured by her own experience and expectations.  She probably knew a guy or two who did exactly this, and she doesn't want you to struggle with that. \n\nAnd despite you not being the AH here, I don't think she is one either.  I think you and your mom need to have a conversation, and tell her that you know all she wants to do is support you, and you appreciate that, and ask her to just listen to you and lay it out step by step.  Tell her the only thing you're really sure about is him, and that you are still attracted to girls, and you're not entirely certain what this means yet, but this isn't about you trying to soften the blow, or keep a foot in the closet.  But you love your friend, and everything else, all the labels and whatever don't  matter. \n\nWell that's what I would say, but you tell her what you're feeling.  Sounds like she just wants to be there for you, and maybe she's a little over bearing, but because she cares and loves you, not because she's trying to control. \n\nShe's a little worried about you, she's doing the best she can.

Especially if they don\u2019t identify that way. Sexuality is fluid and human experience is vast and unique. I know people who have had this experience and it sucks for them that people often invalidate their experiences and identity to call them bi over ONE unique instance.\n\nIt helps to think about for OP & bf for sure, but I also want to point out it\u2019s okay if one or both of them decides they\u2019re straight with an exception. Their identity is for them to think about and decide, and I hope they know it\u2019s okay, and everyone else, too.
