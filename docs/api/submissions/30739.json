It you can change the door to a key lock that you only have access to", "Goto lowes or home depot and buy a key locking door knob and but it on your bathroom door. Also just start using his and don't stop just because he complains. Your best friend is a asshole.", "Your roommate is a pretty prick.  You need to talk and draw up straight guildlined.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s deserving of so many different forms of petty revenge. Have fun with it", "NTA if you cant use his bathroom when hes using yours that becomes torture, you shouldnt be denied to pee in your home. your mutuals surely have been told a completely distorted version of it, ask them what it was.", "NTA. I recommend you two switch bedrooms so you have the private bath. But roomie sounds too inconsiderate to go for that, so you two might consider finding different living arrangements.", "Kick him out", "NTA Get a lock.", "What I read was \"I need a new roommate.\"\n\nNTA, they're disgusting and entitled.", "INFO: Why are still living with him? What he\u2019s doing in your bathroom is gross. Either switch rooms and put a lock on your door, or move out and find more respectful roommates. NTA", "NTA. You have an arrangement and John should have asked you if he could use your bathroom. He sounds rude and entitled.", "NTA. If he won\u2019t switch rooms with you or you actually like your room and bathroom, then get a lock.", "NTA, like at all. No way does he get to use your bathroom but ban you from his.", "NTA. He\u2019s so out of line. He can use your bathroom but you can\u2019t use his? Gtf. Move out if you can, it won\u2019t get better", "NTA, just do what i did and get a new doorknob with a lock for your bathroom & bedroom. i\u2019ve had horrible roommates and always locked everything", "Nta. Offer to switch bedrooms,problem solved", "This some adolescent idiocy right here.\n\nNTA", "And you know they weren\u2019t going to clean it afterwards\u2026", "Backdoor love is a messy business", "But he has to pay for a professional cleaner to clean the bathroom first before a switch - because that job should not be left to OP.", "Absolutely NTA. And I suggest you insist on switching rooms. Your asshole of a housemate is not respecting you bathroom because it isn't in your room. To me, he has lost rights to having an en suite.\n\nAlso, there are two bathrooms. If he is using one, you get to use the other. That means that if he doesn't want you to use his bathroom, he needs to stay the hell out of yours. You can shut that shit down real quick - no way he gets to use one and forbid you from using the other.", "I feel like his bathroom is probably nasty asf smh \nI would have the same idea but would quickly revolt away from it if his bathroom was nasty tbh", "A digital one too so he can\u2019t steal the key", "This is the solution. \nNTA", "And not clean up after themselves, as seems to be the precedence!", "Not even petty if she has to pee\u2026.", "Absolutely this. Why the heck didn\u2019t they go find a spa-included-room well away from a roommate\u2019s property and belongings? The entitlement is just both gross and rude. NTA.", "But that's the issue. He wants the en suite *AND* a bath. I've tried talking to him about this because I like my room and set up and have tried to make compromises but he seems to like the fact that I don't want him to use my bath, if that makes sense?", "You left out cleaning both bathrooms to an acceptable level. \ud83d\udec0", ">Are you saying he has agreed to never use the bath again? Then just gone back on his word/repeatedly switched from that to giving reasons he should be able to use it?\n\nYes. At first I thought he was keeping to his word but he just got sneakier and then the incident a few days ago was just blatantly ignoring me. I have never used his bathroom.", "Yeah, God sure put the fun button in a shit place.", "Meh. That's more of a peace of mind thing. I think she'd just be happy to have access to A bathroom in the apartment she rents when she needs to use it. The fact that there's 2 bathrooms and he insists on full access to both just bugs the shit out of me. It's not like they're sharing one. If it were me, I would just take 'cleaning everything with bleach' as my karmic load to push the issue that mattered to me that much.", "[I guess I'll just piss on the floor ](https://youtube.com/shorts/IT7nOcm8u2Y?si=l3oWSVY8yvDbtWlU)", "I like that answer alot", "Well, he doesn't get to have an en suite AND your bathroom. He's basically denying you access to be able to piss because he doesn't want you in 'his' space while he loofahs for 2 hours. There is virtually no reason why a grown man can't behave like one other than he's an entitled prick. \n\nGet a lock for your bathroom.", "NTA and they\u2019re disgusting. Who the hell plans a romantic bath IN SOMEONE ELSES BATHROOM?! This isn\u2019t a damn hotel. Take that shit to Airbnb. Put a lock on your bathroom bc he is abusing your kindness and his boyfriend tried it.", "Sounds like a control/dominance thing... what an asshat... him. Not you.\n\nNTA", "Start using his bathroom. If he can use yours, you can use his. Or start entering and making a fuss. Get him out of your bathroom, put loud annoying music, keep pestering until he leaves.\n\nBut can you put a lock on your door to stop all this?", "I think its a good time for you to give him an ultimatum. He's being selfish, he wants to have his cake and eat it too. He doesn't get to boss you around and tell you to not do this or that while casually disregarding what you want,  then get mad at you for GASP using your own bathroom.\n\nDoesn't sound like he respects you at all either, given how he doesn't listen to what you ask of him but wants you to respect what he says in return. Very terrible roommate and disgusting too.", "Girl, he is not your best friend, he doesn\u2019t respect you. His needs come first and you can fuck off. You\u2019ve got to get a lock on your door until you can move out or find a new roommate who isn\u2019t an asshole. You are NTA", "So I'm confused why you're allowing him to do this?", "Put a lock on the bathroom.", "Get a lock.\n\nLightly dust the tub with itching powder.\n\nUse his bathroom while he's in yours and make sure you move every single thing in it to the floor.", "Your friend is an asshole it seems. I'm sorry.", "If you don't get access to his bathroom then he can't have access to yours. End of story.", "It almost feels like a kink, at this point.", "I mean, if that's a true representation then NTA but like, it has bad communication viiibes", "What is this, the Penthouse penthouse?", "\"Loofahs for 2 hours\". Nice euphemism for $ex!!", "Yeah, time for a change of room-mates, one way or another."]}
