She lost all entitlement to set expectations when you both got divorced.", "Definitely NTA. Your kids are SO lucky to have you. I can only imagine how difficult all of this has been readjusting to civilian life, single parenting 5 kids, moving, new job, new home, my gosh. You have made every decision in the best interest of your children and as an added bonus they are by extended family. Don\u2019t let her manipulate you.", "One of you is thinking clearly and has your children\u2019s best interests in mind. She can believe whatever she chooses while you keep on taking care of business. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou have settled your kids and setup your life.  She can move to where her children are.\n\nI hope your court is in the same state you settled in.  If you were served there, still some protection.\n\nYou are being a good parent!", "NTA.  How, exactly, is moving back better for the kids?  Because she wants it to be?  Because she just wants to be there?  \n\nNo.  After all that\u2019s happened and all that you\u2019ve done to create stability for your kids and a future for yourself, she can\u2019t expect to just start calling the shots and making demands about what\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d for the kids because she suddenly seems it to be so.  \n\n She can move closer.", "NTA. She  is selfish. Do not move with your children, it sounds like you are doing right by them!", "NTA go to a lawyer now", "NTA.  You did what you needed to and took care of your kids.  Don't let her disrupt their lives more if you can avoid it.", "NTA. Sounds like your family is settled, and she should move to where you are for the sake of the children.", ">She believes I am being selfish and punishing her and not looking out for what\u2019s best for the kids.\n\nShe is the selfish one and you are being an excellent parent by being the ONLY one who has the children's best interest at heart.\n\n>We are settled here, I have a decent job that pays enough, and have nothing going on back there.\n\nYou AND the children are settled. They have a routine? Friends? In school? After school activities? Supportive family for you and them?\n\nThen NTA.", "NTA - So giving up your work in the family business and uprooting your kids for the 2nd time in just over a year is \"best\" for them?  Are you really sure rehab stuck? /s\n\nObviously this is total BS.   If she wants to move closer to her kids, that's up to her but she has no grounds in the world to make you move back to a place that has nothing for you.,  I've done a fair amount of work with family law and I honestly don't think it would be possible for her to get an order from a judge to make you do it at this point.  I could be wrong, but I doubt it.", "NTA\n\nYou have a home, a job, and the kids are settled in school.  THAT is what is best for the kids, not moving them to a random place that their mom MIGHT like.", "NTA - The word selfish is used now when a person doesn\u2019t immediately get their own way.", "NTA\n\n\nThe kids are home. End of discussion.", "NTA she can piss off.. but you really should talk to a lawyer", "NTA. She has no say in this after abandoning you to manage on your own.", "Time to go to court and get custody and child support (her to you) in place.", "NTA.", "NTA. Get a lawyer and file for custody immediately. Do it before she files.", "NTA. You are selfish? That's rich coming from someone who selfishly abandoned her husband and kids (I'm talking about after rehab, addiction is its own monster). Moving kids multiple times is damaging. Those kids need stability. Don't give in.", "NTA, why did it take her this long to remember the kids?", "She filed for divorce after we moved. She also filed in the state that we moved from and they no longer have jurisdiction over the kids. They can only grant the divorce. That just finished. Now has to file up here for child support/custody.", "NTA but him sending her anything at all at this point is dumb as hell. Get a lawyer and file for custody, yesterday. Try to get an emergency declaration of custody. Right now she can take the kids and you can\u2019t do shit. \n\nDon\u2019t talk to her about anything until that is settled.", "The kids are 14, 10, 8, 5, and 2. Some are vocal about not moving, some lean more towards moving, none are 100% for moving.", "She wants you to move back so she can take the kids back in a custody fight in her home state's courts. NTA.  Don't do it!", "Then perhaps it's best you file for full custody and support first. You don't have to take a survey of the household with that. It's just what's done to support the children. Don't get to caught up in it emotionally. This isn't payback, it's legalities.", "Okay. So sounds like the general attitude from all of you leans toward not moving. If that's the case, then I'd say you're NTA. You are the one with your kids and getting their direct input. I'd say you and your does should make the decision, and I don't think your ex's opinion really matters.", "I understand treatment and glad she got it.  But after that she abandoned her kids, and you, if I\u2019m reading this right.  So yes get ahead of her with custody and child support.  Hopefully she will find a job and be able to contribute.  I\u2019m sorry- this must be really tough.", "NTA. If she wants to be close to the kids, she can move near their home.", "NTA\n\nShe abandoned her family therefore she doesn't get to vote on anything. She can move closer to you if anything.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like she ever really cared about what was good for the kids. She still doesn\u2019t", "NTA. But, OP, I hope you aren't talking to her about any of this on the phone. Have it all in text messages and talk with a lawyer. I would NEVER go back there, because then she might be able to argue in court and keep you there. Stay where you're at. Do what's best for your kids and yourself. Document, document, document, and talk to a lawyer.", "Likely because she fell in looove (/s) in rehab which is not uncommon at all but she\u2019s selfish and thinks everything is about her it appears.  If it\u2019s really about the kids, I agree she should move near them after all she\u2019s already moving why does it matter where", "You had better file for custody and child support like yesterday in the county/state you\u2019re in asap. She\u2019s trying to play you.", "File for custody in your state. If you kids have been there for 6 months that state is their primary state for custody.

In most states, both parents need to live close enough to get them to the same school every day.", "\n>why does it matter where\n\nBecause it isn't about the kids, it is about her. Again.", "NTA.  You must immediately see an attorney who can advise you so your soon-to-be ex can't control what happens with the kids. You are the custodial parent and have created a stable life for them. Don't allow her to try to manipulate you!", "NTA. if she cared very much and thought being close to the kids was important, she could've decided to move there. She wanted you to uproot and accommodate to her needs, not what's best for the kids.", "op=NTA\n\nShe can move to your town, if she's willing to move.  She thinks she can just leave and come back and everything will be the same? Not how it works.\n\nYour kids deserve not to be ripped from another home/school for HER convenience.  And how long will she stay \"sober\" or involved this time?  She needs to make the effort to rebuild her life where They are.", "NTA she\u2019s got massive balls to say she was looking out for the kids best interest when she went and up and started finding love that wasn\u2019t with her husband. Tell her pound sand and bite rocks.", "So\u2026 if I\u2019ve got this strait\u2026 your ex had a dependency. She sought treatment, gone for an extended period. Leaves you and the kids to fend for yourselves during this time. You accepted the help offered by family members and got back on your feet. She decides she\u2019s done, but wants you to uproot the stability you\u2019ve built for you and the kids? \n\nNTA", "The \"best interest of the children\" is a stable environment, which they have - a home, a dad who can provide for them, and a family support system. Her request makes zero sense; she's the one who left initially, disrupting their (and your) lives. Not even to mention the fact that she needed rehab... You found the stability your kids needed where you are now. \n\nOne suggestion: if she tries to talk to you on the phone, follow that up with an email repeating what was said (\"Just to confirm your call to me just now, I cannot agree to X, because...\". Document, document, document! Good luck, OP.", "I know, I was making the same point, she wants what she wants and is using the kids to try and get her way.  Hopefully OP won\u2019t fall for it."]}
