She lost all entitlement to set expectations when you both got divorced.", "Definitely NTA. Your kids are SO lucky to have you. I can only imagine how difficult all of this has been readjusting to civilian life, single parenting 5 kids, moving, new job, new home, my gosh. You have made every decision in the best interest of your children and as an added bonus they are by extended family. Don\u2019t let her manipulate you.", "One of you is thinking clearly and has your children\u2019s best interests in mind. She can believe whatever she chooses while you keep on taking care of business. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou have settled your kids and setup your life.  She can move to where her children are.\n\nI hope your court is in the same state you settled in.  If you were served there, still some protection.\n\nYou are being a good parent!", "NTA.  How, exactly, is moving back better for the kids?  Because she wants it to be?  Because she just wants to be there?  \n\nNo.  After all that\u2019s happened and all that you\u2019ve done to create stability for your kids and a future for yourself, she can\u2019t expect to just start calling the shots and making demands about what\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d for the kids because she suddenly seems it to be so.  \n\n She can move closer.", "NTA. She  is selfish. Do not move with your children, it sounds like you are doing right by them!", "NTA go to a lawyer now", "NTA.  You did what you needed to and took care of your kids.

Sounds like your family is settled, and she should move to where you are for the sake of the children.", ">She believes I am being selfish and punishing her and not looking out for what\u2019s best for the kids.\n\nShe is the selfish one and you are being an excellent parent by being the ONLY one who has the children's best interest at heart.\n\n>We are settled here, I have a decent job that pays enough, and have nothing going on back there.\n\nYou AND the children are settled. They have a routine? Friends? In school? After school activities?

Are you really sure rehab stuck? /s\n\nObviously this is total BS.   If she wants to move closer to her kids, that's up to her but she has no grounds in the world to make you move back to a place that has nothing for you.,  I've done a fair amount of work with family law and I honestly don't think it would be possible for her to get an order from a judge to make you do it at this point.  I could be wrong, but I doubt it.", "NTA\n\nYou have a home, a job, and the kids are settled in school.  THAT is what is best for the kids, not moving them to a random place that their mom MIGHT like.", "NTA - The word selfish is used now when a person doesn\u2019t immediately get their own way.", "NTA\n\n\nThe kids are home. End of discussion.", "NTA she can piss off.. but you really should talk to a lawyer", "NTA. She has no say in this after abandoning you to manage on your own.", "Time to go to court and get custody and child support (her to you) in place.", "NTA.", "NTA. Get a lawyer and file for custody immediately. Do it before she files.", "NTA. You are selfish? That's rich coming from someone who selfishly abandoned her husband and kids (I'm talking about after rehab, addiction is its own monster). Moving kids multiple times is damaging. Those kids need stability. Don't give in.", "NTA, why did it take her this long to remember the kids?", "She filed for divorce after we moved. She also filed in the state that we moved from and they no longer have jurisdiction over the kids. They can only grant the divorce. That just finished. Now has to file up here for child support/custody.", "NTA but him sending her anything at all at this point is dumb as hell. Get a lawyer and file for custody, yesterday. Try to get an emergency declaration of custody. Right now she can take the kids and you can\u2019t do shit. \n\nDon\u2019t talk to her about anything until that is settled.", "The kids are 14, 10, 8, 5, and 2. Some are vocal about not moving, some lean more towards moving, none are 100% for moving.", "She wants you to move back so she can take the kids back in a custody fight in her home state's courts. NTA.  Don't do it!", "Then perhaps it's best you file for full custody and support first. You don't have to take a survey of the household with that. It's just what's done to support the children. Don't get to caught up in it emotionally. This isn't payback, it's legalities.", "Okay. So sounds like the general attitude from all of you leans toward not moving. If that's the case, then I'd say you're NTA. You are the one with your kids and getting their direct input. I'd say you and your does should make the decision, and I don't think your ex's opinion really matters.", "I understand treatment and glad she got it.  But after that she abandoned her kids, and you, if I\u2019m reading this right.  So yes get ahead of her with custody and child support.  Hopefully she will find a job and be able to contribute.  I\u2019m sorry- this must be really tough."]}
