However since they had him almost 2 years ago my SIL has made snide comments aimed at me like \"oh I wish there was 2 of him, I'd make a perfect twin mom\" or \"oh if you're ever a mom I can help you out, first time moms have it so hard\". Here's the thing, I was a mom, to the sweetest baby girl, who passed away a few months after she was born, who had a stillborn twin. Emma was well aware of this as geo had adopted my daughter because i was unable to keep her, I'd dealt with comments like these since she had my nephew. This all came to a head about a month ago when my SIL said \"oh I hope we have another one, although can you handle watching two babies, since you don't know what it's like to watch one kid for more than 4 hours?\" Asking me, as if I didn't have my kid and all of the little ones in our family which I was still very much responsible for helping with, meaning 8 hour babysitting jobs & nights if another baby was being born & a baby sitter was needed, before my daughters passing. I had gotten upset, done with her comments & replied with \"I had kids y'know, I can handle watching 6+ kids at once. The better question is if you can, because you don't take care of your kid unless it's to post on social media, you're only the parent when you guys do fun stuff with Jay, or when you can post what he's doing.\" My SIL snapped back \"well you clearly weren't a good parent since your brat passed away at 6 months old & was left for my husband to watch.\" I was furious. I replied with \"SHE wasn't left for your husband to watch, I was here everyday that I could be, the only reason you stood by your miracle boy is because you gained sympathy due to his condition. I can't believe you'd make a fucked up comment like that.\" And left after saying that. I informed my brother of what his wife had said & what I had said in response and said it was due to the fact I was really upset. When he got home he grilled into her, asking how she could say something like that to me knowing what I went through with my kids, & that he was upset at her and wouldn't be talking to her till she apologizes, she never did. she, instead, went to her family & some of mine looking for support, now I am getting called an asshole from both sides & told \"I wasn't a real mother\" since my surviving child passed away at 6 months old, my brother adopted & watched her, and that I shouldn't have painted my SIL as a \"social media parent\" who only parents infront of the camera.
