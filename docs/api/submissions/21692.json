This will be a deal breaker for a vast majority of people though.", "NAH. His needs out of the relationship have Changed. It\u2019s okay to reassess what each of you need at different stages and it doesn\u2019t make either of you an AH if those needs change.\n\nIt\u2019s just time to decide whether you\u2019d rather maintain the relationship by adjusting to his current needs or let the relationship go by meeting your needs. \n\nNo shame in the decision, but the relationship probably can\u2019t sustain itself if your needs don\u2019t align.", "NAH - you don't want to live with him and he wants to live with you. Right now, it doesn't sound like there is a compromise and unfortunately that might end the relationship because with both options one person may be unhappy either way.", "NAH. Things change for some people and don\u2019t for others. It\u2019s a shame as your relationship is probably doomed sadly", "I feel like NAH. It seems like you never wanted to live together, he didnt either. Thats why it worked out. Now he changed his mind after realizing it doesnt work for him. A lot of people want to move in with their partner after a certain time. He is not the AH for that but neither are you for standing your ground. However you may not work out in the end because that is a huge point. You shouldnt be forced to move in but he shouldnt be forced to be in a relationship that doesnt meet his expectations anymore.", "NAH - It\u2019s reasonable to want to move the relationship further along by living together, and it\u2019s reasonable for you to not be ready to make the switch after he\u2019s changed his mind.  \n\nIt sounds like it\u2019s time to make some negotiations on behalf of your relationship though.", "I will agree NAH. You don\u2019t put ages so \u201c8 years\u201d could mean you started dating in high school\u2026\n\nI think there needs to be some sort of discussion as to where this is all going.

Tell him this is your deal breaker.", "NTA.   You have every right to decide how you live and who you live with.  You may change your mind in the future, and you may not.   In either case, it should be because it's what you want, not by being guilted into it.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo many relationships now are unconventional.   You're certainly not alone in choosing to live apart!  (I'm in the same situation, and very happily).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you talked to him about why he's so adamant about this now?    Sounds to me as if it might be a security issue for him?   Commitment isn't proven by living together!", "NTA, but you just have to prepared that this is one of those \"big decisions\" in a relationship. You're allowed to \\*not\\* change your mind, as much as he \\*is\\* allowed to change his. So your relationship may not last if you no longer want the same things.", "NTA. He wants something else. People change.  If he thinks emotional pressure from himself and his family and friends will make you happy then he is not taking you into consideration.  Maybe it's time to move on.", "NTA. He's changed what he wants, and you haven't. Simple as that. Tell your family and friends to keep their abnormally large noses out of your business. Good luck.", "NTA - its a fundamental change to the relationship and requires full consent of BOTH parties. These kind of things are a two yes votes needed but only one to veto. However if he is insistent then sad to say it may be a sign the relationship has run its course", "NTA why is it you who has to change their mind?", "NTA but hope this doesnt put a chip on his shoulder", "NTA.  He\u2019s not ta for changing his mind but he is for expecting you to automatically also change.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How you deal with the different views can.\n\nhave you considered a duplex? LOL", "NTA - people change over time. If this is not something you want to do then don\u2019t. Do not feel pressured. But it might be time to move on.", "Jumping on the top comment to say that, theoretically at least, it is possible to get closer without actually living together. I remember reading an article a few years back about couples who were married but didn't want to live together, and at least a few of them lived in apartments next door to each other. I think one couple maybe bought a duplex, and each person had half.\n\nBut if OP doesn't want to get any closer than they are, and the bf wants to live together, then yeah, they're just no longer compatible.", "I'm 35 he's 36", "NAH. You two have discussed this upfront. He has changed his mind. You haven't. You are not damaging anything. You two just have became incompatibile. That is no ones fault. \n\nLiving arragement is one of basic points of compatibility. This is similar to you wanting to live where you are while he would change mind to live abroad.\n\nDon't push yourself to something you don't want.", "NTA living together is not always the best choice for a couple. Eg my father and his girlfriend tried to live together for years, but because they have really different lifestyles and thoughts on chores etc they figured out living together is not a part of their relationship. They can thrive as a couple without living together.\nYou should have a talk about this with your partner. Maybe it\u2019s a dealbreaker for him not to live together, maybe you can make him understand why you don\u2019t want to live together, but even tho it\u2019s not the most common thing for a couple to live seperatly, it can still work better in some cases then living together. Best of luck to you!", "NTA, but truthfully it doesn't sound like you have a meaningful/serious relationship either.", "NAH it sounds like you guys aren't compatible though. Not living together with a partner of almost a decade would be a deal-breaker for most people.", "NTA, but this is a deal breaker. Your arrangement isn't what the vast majority of people want out of a long term relationship. Most likely he's going to dump you and find someone that will take that next step in intimacy.", "NAH, you just don\u2019t love him. Time to be honest with each other.", "It's natural to change one's mind. But if you truly didn't want this, you need to re-evaluate your relationship. If he put pressure or ultimatum, then chooses whether to stay or leave the relationship.", "NTA. Nobody can make that decision for you. He\u2019s the one changing the agreement, not you.", "NAH, but this relationship may need to end if one of you refuses to budge on this topic", "If his needs have changed and you still maintain your position you are gonna have to separate", "NTA - you\u2019re allowed to live however you want, entirely your decision. However, this will probably lead to the relationship ending eventually", "you don\u2019t want to live with him, or anyone (?), forcing yourself into a situation you don\u2019t want to be in won\u2019t help the relationship, and he and the other people who said so are leaning very hard on heteronormative culture imo. you don\u2019t have to live together, you don\u2019t have to get married, you don\u2019t have to have kids. plenty of people find the idea of having a romantic relationship without living together appealing, but it seems he is no longer one of them. it\u2019s not fair to make either of you compromise if that\u2019s not what you want. i would say n a h, but he\u2019s the one who changed the terms and now he\u2019s claiming you\u2019re damaging the relationship so i\u2019m going nta. i do think you should go your separate ways. sorry."]}
