YTA", "E Ah-ish H\n\nYou have some responsibility for dressing the children, but your nephew and his wife are the bigger AHs for carrying a grudge and not giving your daughter a Christmas gift.\n\nResearch and prepare for weddings ahead of time, including asking specifically about what to wear if you are not sure. If an event is semi-casual, jeans are not really wedding attire unless you have nothing else. (Clearly, you did as you shopped for the event.) The boys were probably given room since they were neat, clean, and (well) boys. \n\nThe unicorn dress with fairy wings and princess dress with tiara pushed the boundary from wedding wear to costume wear. They were probably given a pass as they were three and five. \n\nWhile the ten year-old\u2019s dress was a semi-casual sun dress, it was white and the bride asked you to change. Even though it may have been an unreasonable and inconvenient request, her opinion is the only one that matters on her wedding day. \n\nWas it five minutes before the ceremony with no options? Since it was in a park, were you miles away from a store or a friend who could loan your daughter a dress? Would the bride have come to her senses had you explained your lack of alternatives, mentioned the challenge of taking your entire family shopping, or asked her what she might suggest?\n\nBrides are notoriously emotional on their wedding days, so simply apologizing and asking if she would prefer that your family leave may have brought her to reality. She would then have months to stew over whether or not she made the right decision rather than obsess about a little girl\u2019s white dress at her wedding. \n\nAt any rate, they are the AH for putting it all on the child and not giving her a gift at Christmas. It\u2019s not as if your ten year-old set out to ruin the wedding and adamantly refused to problem solve. \n\nYou best course of action (after making sure your daughter is consoled) would be to let this one go as you both have given it far more attention than it deserves.

BUT... the fact of the matter is that a lot of brides are SUPER possessive of that white color at their wedding -- even when absolutely nobody in their right mind would ever confuse the person for the bride. So... you really should have quashed your niece's dress decision (and let's face it -- a ten year old is old enough to take the explanation of \"nobody wears white but the bride\" at face value and run with it). So... soft AH there.\n\nOn the other hand, your nephew and his wife are just absolutely WAY out of line and taking this WAY too far.

It\u2019s not even 100% white, not that it matters because she\u2019s literally 10.

And for them to single her out like that and give the other kids presents but not her is sad.\n\nThat being said, it is a HUGE wedding faux pas to wear white to a wedding when you aren't the bride. I was always taught its seen as an insult to the bride. But usually it's an adult though. A child wearing white is different. And both the times I was a flower girl growing up, the bride dressed me in white. If it were my wedding I'd have not been happy about if she wasn't my flower girl, but my words would have been with the child's guardian and them alone and it would have been a passing comment not a held grudge.
