If an event is semi-casual, jeans are not really wedding attire unless you have nothing else. (Clearly, you did as you shopped for the event.) The boys were probably given room since they were neat, clean, and (well) boys. \n\nThe unicorn dress with fairy wings and princess dress with tiara pushed the boundary from wedding wear to costume wear. They were probably given a pass as they were three and five. \n\nWhile the ten year-old\u2019s dress was a semi-casual sun dress, it was white and the bride asked you to change. Even though it may have been an unreasonable and inconvenient request, her opinion is the only one that matters on her wedding day. \n\nWas it five minutes before the ceremony with no options? Since it was in a park, were you miles away from a store or a friend who could loan your daughter a dress? Would the bride have come to her senses had you explained your lack of alternatives, mentioned the challenge of taking your entire family shopping, or asked her what she might suggest?\n\nBrides are notoriously emotional on their wedding days, so simply apologizing and asking if she would prefer that your family leave may have brought her to reality.

So... you really should have quashed your niece's dress decision (and let's face it -- a ten year old is old enough to take the explanation of \"nobody wears white but the bride\" at face value and run with it).

I was always taught its seen as an insult to the bride. But usually it's an adult though. A child wearing white is different. And both the times I was a flower girl growing up, the bride dressed me in white.

You said yourself that you thought two of the dresses might have been problematic, and yet still made the decision to have the kids wear those dresses.  I think that shows a bit of a lack of caring.
