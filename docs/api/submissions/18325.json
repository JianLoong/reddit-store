BIL said that since I\u2019m used to it the most, it\u2019s only natural I manage mom\u2019s care. Plus, my sister will be dealing with my niece.

It's also AH behavior to just expect your sister and BIL to take responsibility for your sons without you or your husband going along to do so, since it sounds like your mom certainly isn't up to that task.", "I went back and forth. ESH Your BIL is TA for expecting you to take care of mom on vacation when you do it every day of your life. Your sister should contribute not only on vacation but in every day life. But expecting him to pay for the care on top of everything and the part where you're sending your kids without you makes you TA. You cannot force your sister to do the right thing. I'm a mom of 4 and having a 2 year old is a poor excuse.  But you are the mom of your boys, and you should expect to ask them to do their part in helping with grandma. Your BIL has no say in that. If you couldn't afford to pay for the care (I understand that's a stretch as a resident) then your boys and husband should take the burden off you. It's a paid for trip but nothing is ever free. Your brother in law is expecting you to pay in labor. You are better off saving for your own vacation with your boys. \n\nAnd stop taking your niece off your sisters hands all the time.

But if they are paying for your *entire* family, all expenses, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to pay for your mom\u2019s care on the trip. You are an asshole if you decided to stay home (to avoid caring for your mom) but you expect them to still be cool with taking your kids on the trip.

But it just sounds like people trying to figure out how to make this happen.   \n\nHard part is when you have an aging parent or a parent with physical trouble. There is only so much you can do.   \n\nWhat about having mom stay home? She may be sad but it could be good for a break and a stress free vacation. Probably easier to hire someone at home.", "ESH\n\nYour sis and BIL should absolutely help more with the day to day care of your mom, either physically or financially, rather than the entire responsibility falling on you. \n\nHowever, you chose a rotten hill to die on. They are willing to allow a caregiver to accompany you all to their time share with the (reasonable) expectation that you pay for the caregiver. An all expense paid vacation for four to Hawaii (five including the weekend your husband is there) vs the cost of a caregiver for mom for a few days\u2026you are absolutely on the better end of this deal. \n\nPlus, your poor mom is the ultimate loser in this. You say she feels thrown in the middle, but I would\nwager a guess that she also feels like a burden whose children are arguing over who gets stuck having to help her with basic tasks that she probably already feels dehumanized for needing help with in the first place. \n\nNot to mention the very bold assumption that your children would still be able to attend the trip if you aren\u2019t going.", "NAH \n\nThis isn\u2019t a vacation for anyone. It\u2019s living your lives for 10 days in Hawaii.
