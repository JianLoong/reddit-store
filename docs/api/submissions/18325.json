BIL said that since I\u2019m used to it the most, it\u2019s only natural I manage mom\u2019s care. Plus, my sister will be dealing with my niece. And he says that the boys shouldn\u2019t be put to work on their vacay. \n\nMy husband defended me that it\u2019s unfair to put it all on me as it\u2019s a vacation for everyone. I suggested we hire a caregiver to accompany us. Bil agreed but only if me and hubby pay for it. \n\nWe went home and I told my husband that I\u2019m not going but the boys can still go. He said that was probably for the best, and he\u2019ll still take those days off and we\u2019ll have a staycation.\n\nWell, he told my sister and bil, and they are not happy.

I'm a mom of 4 and having a 2 year old is a poor excuse.  But you are the mom of your boys, and you should expect to ask them to do their part in helping with grandma. Your BIL has no say in that. If you couldn't afford to pay for the care (I understand that's a stretch as a resident) then your boys and husband should take the burden off you. It's a paid for trip but nothing is ever free.

An all expense paid vacation for four to Hawaii (five including the weekend your husband is there) vs the cost of a caregiver for mom for a few days\u2026you are absolutely on the better end of this deal. \n\nPlus, your poor mom is the ultimate loser in this.

Quite frankly, given the fact that you\u2019re providing all of your mom\u2019s physical care by yourself, *and* watching your sister\u2019s kid, the *least* your sister & BIL could do is pay for a caregiver for mom, so that you can enjoy the family vacation like everyone else. The fact that they\u2019re actually refusing to take care of your mom for one trip, and are also refusing to chip in for a caregiver, makes it pretty clear that they\u2019re taking advantage of you. It also says a lot about how they view your mother, which is pretty sad. Drop the rope. Stop babysitting for your sister. Focus on your mother, but don\u2019t do a damn thing for sister and BIL.", "NTA.  There are lots of people in the world today who define a family vacation as \"everybody gets to relax and enjoy themselves except XXXXX, who has to continue taking care of (the kids/disabled brother/autistic sister/medically challenged family member) that they already spend 24/7 taking care of, they just get to do it in a different location\".  \n\nYou gave your BIL the correct response - bet he comes back and says your boys can't go and mom ends up not going also.  After all, sister has her hands full with the 2-year-old.", "NTA- I can't believe that your sister doesn't have you back since you have been helping her out with her kid as well to give her a break.

Her father is well-off enough to hire a nanny to help care for your niece. And they contribute nothing to the care of your mother. \n\nYou have your mum to look after and your own family. You will have a massive care-giver burn out if you continue to look after everyone else and don\u2019t take your own needs into consideration. You need to prioritise your needs before your sister\u2019s as she is not doing the same for you.", "Have your mum move in with your sister.

That is not a holiday. Basically, \u201cthis guy\u201d is paying \u201cthe nanny/carer\u201d (OP) to look after everyone, all the time, for the whole vacation.\n\nI can tell you now, even if it were just OP, with her mother, travelling with someone who will need a wheelchair at the airports (99% probability), it will not be relaxing, not pleasant.", "Loud arrogant and brash... my lady, you have tickled my fancy. My my. Who knew I had a type.", "Oh No, you are being an AH for sending your kids to a vacation without you or their father, and you expecting your sister to watch them. \n\nAs far as your mom situation, your sister needs to learn how to cope with her, stop enabling them, and share custody of your mom\u2019s care with her.", "So OP can watch her niece all the time but god forbid her sister watch her 2 older boys for one vacation?"]}
