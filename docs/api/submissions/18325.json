BIL said that since I\u2019m used to it the most, it\u2019s only natural I manage mom\u2019s care. Plus, my sister will be dealing with my niece.

I'm a mom of 4 and having a 2 year old is a poor excuse.  But you are the mom of your boys, and you should expect to ask them to do their part in helping with grandma. Your BIL has no say in that. If you couldn't afford to pay for the care (I understand that's a stretch as a resident) then your boys and husband should take the burden off you. It's a paid for trip but nothing is ever free.

An all expense paid vacation for four to Hawaii (five including the weekend your husband is there) vs the cost of a caregiver for mom for a few days\u2026you are absolutely on the better end of this deal. \n\nPlus, your poor mom is the ultimate loser in this.

Quite frankly, given the fact that you\u2019re providing all of your mom\u2019s physical care by yourself, *and* watching your sister\u2019s kid, the *least* your sister & BIL could do is pay for a caregiver for mom, so that you can enjoy the family vacation like everyone else. The fact that they\u2019re actually refusing to take care of your mom for one trip, and are also refusing to chip in for a caregiver, makes it pretty clear that they\u2019re taking advantage of you. It also says a lot about how they view your mother, which is pretty sad. Drop the rope. Stop babysitting for your sister. Focus on your mother, but don\u2019t do a damn thing for sister and BIL.", "NTA.  There are lots of people in the world today who define a family vacation as \"everybody gets to relax and enjoy themselves except XXXXX, who has to continue taking care of (the kids/disabled brother/autistic sister/medically challenged family member) that they already spend 24/7 taking care of, they just get to do it in a different location\".  \n\nYou gave your BIL the correct response - bet he comes back and says your boys can't go and mom ends up not going also.  After all, sister has her hands full with the 2-year-old.", "NTA- I can't believe that your sister doesn't have you back since you have been helping her out with her kid as well to give her a break. Sound like they just expect you to take care of everyone while they get to do what they want. I suspect your sister will pawn her kid off on you as well since she's been doing that already. They should be willing to help take care of your mom or help with the cost of help so that everyone can get a much-needed break. Stay home and do your thing and they can take care of your kids since you have been doing it for them.", "NTA and I think they expected you to babysit their daughter too.", "NTA. BIL expects everyone to enjoy their vacation while you continue living your normal life just in a different setting", "Hawaii can be very dangerous. When the Bradys went the boys found an idol at a construction site that caused the family a lot of grief and danger.\n\n\nNTA, stay safe", "NTA! Keep the boys and take a family vacation without everyone else", "ESH\n\nThis is NOT a situation to throw your 6 year old into on his own.  Your 14 year old would probably be fine, except for the parts where he'd be stuck babysitting the 2 year old the entire time or doing caregiver activities for your mom that he's not qualified for.  Your 6 year old?  It wouldn't take much for him to get seriously scared or hurt by inattentive or frustrated caregivers.\n\nSend your mom with them.  Do a staycation.  Also, even if your husband gets a golden weekend, traveling to and from Hawaii is a LOT for one weekend.  He'd be too tired to do anything and miss anything fun.  A staycation could have a lot of benefits for the whole family.", "NTA.  You need a vacation, not doing the stuff you do at home with the added hassle of traveling to do it.   Sounds like your BIL needs to 'get used' to it himself and stop expecting you to do it.", "NTA", "So they only invited you to continue caring for the sick mother who gets a vacation. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Question. Are your boys years old or months old?", "NTA for not going but YWBTA for sending your 3 kids without a guardian. I get that they probably wanted you along to help with mom and daughter but you can\u2019t retaliate by saying \u201cno but you can watch my 3 kids on your vacation\u201d", "NTA. It was a bad deal. They clearly didn't care about your experience and now they're mad they need to work the logistics out like they should have.\n\nAsk them why is so hard to respect your boundaries if they keep pushing it. Are you not deserving of a vacation? What the hell is that", "NTA. Your siblings are very calculated. It's cheaper for them to give you a free trip in exchange for your caregiving during the actual vacation, than hiring a caregiver for Hawaii. If they want you to pay for the caregiver, you should start billing then for your caregiving during the year. I feel so bad for your mother who must feel like such an expensive inconvenience.", "Agreed. Hard NTA. This would be no vacay for OP. A staycation for OP's entire immediate family sounds like a great idea.\n\nThat said, OP would be an AH if they insisted their sons still go on the trip without her or her husband. The sister would probably be the one watching them, especially the 6 year old, and that wouldn't be fair to her.", "I'm a bit at a loss here. By \"the boys\", did OP/BIL mean BIL and husband or OP's sons?! Either way, who the f is this guy to say what another adult or someone else's kids should be doing?", "Next post will be, mom left all the inheritance to me and my family says I'm the ah.", "I promise the 14 yo would end up stuck with the toddler.", "This is the best suggestion! Mom should get to enjoy a Hawaii vacay with her other daughter!", "Yeah and they get to say they paid for everyone to go including mother with MS aren\u2019t we so awesome!!! OP is just there to take care of everyone else.", "Why should OP be solely responsible for their mother? They should split the cost.", "OP is not \u201con the better end of the deal.\u201d OP is already mom\u2019s caregiver 24/7/365, plus babysitting the sister\u2019s kid on top of that. An in-home private caregiver for mom (comparable to what OP has been doing) could easily cost $10K or more *per month.* OP has been doing that for free, for many months, without any help or a break. Even if sister and BIL paid for a caregiver for the whole trip *and* for OP\u2019s family to go on the trip, sister and BIL would be coming out way ahead\u2026they\u2019re just too greedy and selfish to realize. They have no clue how much responsibility they\u2019ve dumped onto OP, or how much money OP has actually saved them. If they want mom to go on the trip, they need to do the work to make it happen\u2026not pile *more* work and *more* expenses onto OP\u2019s plate.", "I mean, the BIL found a wife 20 years his junior. That's often (not always, but often) an indication of someone who likes to be in control. (They get a young wife with the intention of being able to mold her into what they want...)", "Probably both, because caregiving is women\u2019s work, or at least I would bet good money that\u2019s BIL\u2019s view.", "Agree, which is part of why I say don\u2019t send the boys.", "BIL strikes me as a bit sexist. The 3 boys are likely fairly safe from babysitting.", "Agreed! Her sister sucks. I just would like to be cognizant of it being a fine line of not hurting the innocent kid. If OP enjoys spending time with her niece, she should not cut her out completely. OP could be giving this child the only quality caretaking she receives. She should do it only when it benefits her niece and not be about helping the sister.", "Yeah my super abusive ex was 15 years older than me. He would talk about how all his previous exes were more \"compliant\" than me. Like direct quote he used the word compliant. He also frequently called me loud, arrogant, and brash.", "Someday they will likely be well off, but the dreams for the future certainly doesn\u2019t help the present.", "Ahh but your husband is awesome because he helps people.", "Info. \n\nDoes your MOM want to go? My mom had ALS and my dad had cancer. I helped out a lot in moms care and was the solo care taker for dad. I know how horrible it can be. I know how stressful it can be. I know it's a full time job. Not all vacations are about rest and relaxation. Is this something your mom wants to do while she's still partly able? I know my parents wouldn't ever put themselves in the middle either, but having memories like that means a lot still after they're gone. \n\nI don't blame you for being upset. I don't blame you for anything that yall did or said. It's rough. But maybe take a look at the offer from a different lense.", "NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous for them to expect you to spend the vacation caring for your mom, especially when it sounds like your sister doesn\u2019t help at all.", "NTA for not wanting to go and having to be the only one taking care of your mom. But then why do u expect your sister and BIL to take care of all 3 of your boys while u and your husband have a staycation?", "NTA. Wait, are your three sons a burden you need to pawn off or are they no trouble at all so you don't even need a vacation?  Your BIL and sisters are hypocrites.  You obviously have a ton of responsibilities.  Why do you just have to be used to it but they get a break?  They were going to saddle you with all the kids and your mom and are now pissy you aren't falling for it.", "NTA, and them demanding that you either spend the whole time taking care of your mom or pay for her to get taken care of is a major AH move. Maybe taking care of your mom will give them an opportunity to see what they were requesting of you", "Info: are you sending your children off with resentful family members?", "I totally understand the caregiving side, I also understand that the offer was given for your whole family, not for just your kids- putting your sis and in laws also as their guardians for the trip. However, I don\u2019t see why hiring a caregiver and splitting the cost isn\u2019t an option.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThey only want you there to babysit mom while they play. They're.... not good people.", "I mean, they are paying for the trip, which I suspect is in part because they expected you to play caregiver. I'm assuming hiring an actual caregiver wouldn't cost nearly as much as a Hawaii trip for a family of 5. They aren't wrong that it's rude to make them take your 3 boys, especially considering your youngest boy definitely isn't self-sufficient. However, your mother isn't solely your responsibility, and that's a separate issue you should work out. For example, my mom and her sister's take turns with the caretaking, and her brothers are in charge of expenses.", "And your mother should be grateful for your care and pick your side! BTW", "NTA. Clearly you've been the sister stuck with all of the care for your mother and your other sisters can't even be bothered to share duties for a short week or so.", "If you are serving as your mother's care giver, you can receive a salary for that from Medicare/Medicaid. \n\nSo you regjlarly take care of your sister's child, in addition to your two children, and your mother. And they are mad at the idea of taking care of your boys? Your relationship is extremely lopsided. \n\nNTA.", "Hard to blame you. The vacation didn\u2019t end up sounding like fun after all. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to send your children. None of them will watch them with the care you would. Something could happen. NTA.", "HELL no, NTA!!  WHY would you go all that way just to have everydamnthing dumped on you just as it is when you\u2019re *not* on vacation??", "NTA- Wow, your sister doesn't even help take care of your mom at all. That actually reminds me of my moms siblings.  Most of them didn't help take care of my grandma, it was mostly just my mom.\n\nEdit: Sure my mom was a SAHM but still. My older sister and I had to help take care of our grandma more so then even my aunts and uncles helped. Anyway, it sounds like your sisters just taking advantage of you.", "NTA. Your mother has two children, just like your niece has two parents. And you have not just your mother to care for but your own children. Accordingly, all of the adults (except your mom) should be sharing in the caregiving responsibilities. Your sister is going to be busy with her daughter? Good thing that her husband is there to share the parenting (something he didn\u2019t seem to suggest was an option, unsurprisingly). That way your sister can share the caregiving of your mom with you, leaving your husband to share your boys\u2019 care with you. Everybody has responsibilities and everyone has time off. That\u2019s how it should work.", "NTA. But why is your sister with a controlling man 20 yrs older than she is?\n\nIt's not a vacation if you have to provide care 24/7", "NTA. Siblings think being the primary caregiver for their parents isn't a big deal. Which they made quite clear to you (and me, of course) You deserve and need a staycation! Take it.", "NTA. you deserve a break too", "How much would a care giver cost? If it\u2019s still worth it for an all expenses paid trip maybe everyone could benefit from the caregiver in some way (your mother, your sister, your 6 y/o). Maybe your sister with help with some of the cost. Just a thought", ":( I can\u2019t stop thinking about your mom in all this. She already (I imagine) feels awful and guilty that you have to take care of her in the first place. Now all this because of her too. ESH. My parents don\u2019t need that kind of help yet, but I\u2019d hate for them to think and hear how much of a burden they are.", "NTA. Also in reference to \u2018I am her main caregiver and chauffer. I don\u2019t mind any of this obviously. It\u2019s what you do.\u2019 please read about eldest daughter syndrome. \n\nIt\u2019s so great that your husband stood up for you and you have his support!", "NTA, but I would not send a 6 year old on a vacation without one of the parents along. It\u2019s not safe and also unfair to ask your sister to take care of a six year old who is not self sufficient, your mom and your niece.", "NTA but your poor mom, hope she doesn\u2019t get made to feel like a burden for needing help. It\u2019s seriously stink they put all of the caregiving duties, or the cost of a caregiver on you. Considering their last comments about how they feel you are pawning your kids off - I would cancel the boys from going, unfortunately. Hopefully you are able to do something else fun.", "NTA\n\nYou're under no obligation to go, and after you've filled in for your sister with her child and as the sole caregiver for your mom, she can damned well look after your sons for a week in Hawaii.  (Although you'd better come up with some clear rules for water sport supervision, and only send them if you trust her completely, as otherwise I worry about their safety in the water.)\n\nIf you go, the lack of help with your mom isn't fair to you, your children, or your husband.  \n\nI'm so glad he has your back!  Also,  I also hope he's going into a medical specialty that's sufficiently well paid to hire some help so you can at least have respite care in future.  A mom with MS; a two year old niece whose mom is withdrawn due to post-partum (and a really controlling thoughtless husband); three boys between 6 and 14; and a husband with very long hours thanks to a residency -- yikes!!!  You deserve several years in a spa (assuming you like spas) and a diet consisting entirely of chocolate souffle.", "NTA\n\nalso be careful with that whole timeshare nonsense. There are weird laws about them, and you could accidentally end up inheriting it if you're not careful. There's paperwork to sign to reject them,  but it's hard to do.", "ESH - This is a crappy version of a holiday for everyone, as everyone by the sounds NEEDS one and none of you will get one except the children but it's the adults that are in desperate need of respite. They're AH for expecting you to continue all the care for mum (not a holiday for you) and you're the AH for still sending your kids and expecting them to look after them and your mother too. I suggest rethinking all of it", "Not really related to the post, but Hawaiians have been begging people to stop vacationing there for years. One of their main water sources was contaminated by US military fuel leakages, and they're struggling to meet the needs of residents. Please, encourage people to stay away.", "I mean, she watches her niece a lot too. I mean, this is only one time op is asking vs the several times her sister asks.", "The oldest is 14 and the youngest is 6.\n\nEdit: And op would be sending the 14 and 12 year old. The only problem I see with that is them forcing one of the boys to watch their younger cousin.", "Sister doesn't help care for their mom at all. Also, op always watches the niece. It's only fair.", "I\u2019m confused about this as well.  Did OP mean that HER three sons would be sent to Hawaii with grandma/BIL/sister?  While the boy\u2019s parents AKA OP and her husband stayed home?", "OPs sons!", "I mean\u2026 \u201cthis guy\u201d *is* the one providing an all expenses paid trip, apparently. Not surprised he\u2019s given his opinions", "OP commented that she wants the two oldest to still go on the vacation without her.", "True", "By \u2018boys\u2019 I meant my children, yes. The older two really really want to go. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll keep my 6yo home and see if BIL is okay with the other two, since they\u2019re more self-sufficient.", "So, I absolutely don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for you to be expected to do all the care for your mom in Hawaii.  You absolutely need and deserve a break, but I wouldn\u2019t be ok if my SIL/BIL/etc wanted to just send their children.  They will still need care.  When the kids were invited it was with the understanding that they\u2019d have at least one parent to take care of them.  \n\nI think the caregiving for mom is separate from the caregiving for the children.  \n\nI think you are N T A for not wanting to go but are T A for expecting them to babysit your kids when that wasn\u2019t offered.  \n\nSorry.", "YTA for sending your sons and expecting your SIL and brother to pay and watch out for them w/o you.", "I think you AND your boys should stay home."]}
