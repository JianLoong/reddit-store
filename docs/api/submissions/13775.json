Husband has a best friend (Alex) who he is very close with. They\u2019ve known each other since they were teenagers, went to the same college, been roommates, been each other\u2019s best men, all that stuff. Alex is married as well and even though they don\u2019t live in the same town, the four of us spend a lot of time together. We visit, they visit, we travel together. They're great!\n\nThe issue is that the guys are (in my opinion) overly affectionate towards each other and have this running \u201cjoke\u201d where they pretend to be a couple around each other. Especially in public. It\u2019s been like this since I\u2019ve known them and it seemed funny/cute at first but lately it\u2019s been making me very uncomfortable. They cuddle on the couch while watching TV for hours, they give each other piggyback rides like children, pinch each other\u2019s nipples at the table, slap each others butts. I\u2019ve seen it all : from wrestling on the beach in speedos to ear biting in the gym. They call each other \u201cdaddy\u201d, \u201cprincess\u201d, \u201cbaby girl/baby boy\u201d and ALWAYS have at least one dance together when we\u2019re in a situation where people dance. They do it around both of our parents, friends, relatives, strangers. \n\nTo be clear, there is no doubt in my mind that these men are straight, I don\u2019t suspect there\u2019s anything more than a friendship between them. Alex is very affectionate and attentive with me, no issue there either. It\u2019s just that this behavior seems ridiculous and juvenile. It\u2019s honestly humiliating sometimes. They were visiting us this weekend, we went to dinner last night and my husband actually told the waiter \u201cmy wife will have X and my daddy right here will have X\u201d. I excused myself from the table, calmed down and came back. Did not mention it. Later we were home and I shared all of this with Alex\u2019s wife over a glass of wine. She laughed it off at first (as we have always done in the past) but after I made it clear that I was serious and told her I do not think it\u2019s okay for grown men to behave like this, especially in public where people might not get the \u201cjoke\u201d, she said I\u2019m embarrassing myself and that she\u2019s disappointed in me for being so close-minded. From there it escalated. She told her husband, her husband told mine and now everyone\u2019s mad at me for \u201csuddenly making an issue of something that wasn\u2019t an issue all these years\u201d. My husband told me that he\u2019ll now feel self-conscious about being affectionate and all touchy with his best friend because I made it clear how I feel about it and that I ruined a good thing. They were supposed to leave tomorrow morning, but they left today and now my husband\u2019s playing video games and not talking to me. Alex and I have never really had problems before so I have no idea what to do next.\n\nI\u2019m willing to hear you out, Reddit. Am I crazy for seeing an issue with this?

But it was a mistake to talk to your friend about it though IMO.", "I'm imagining myself sitting a table nearby and hearing that line to the waiter...then looking and then seeing the look on your face. I would not be able to say you're the asshole for how you felt. There is definitely a line when it comes to platonic affection and it seems like they blew past the line in the dust years ago. Obviously from this point, you should have a frank discussion about how this has been bothering you for a while. \n\nNTA\n\nTbh the other 3 are in complete denial if they think this is normal.", "NTA for a couple reasons.\n\nFor one, you're allowed to have boundaries in your relationship. I do think it would have been better if you had talked to your husband about this first--but it's really disrespectful that your husband won't even consider your feelings about it. \n\nFor another, these jokes are harmful to the queer community. The \"joke\" here is that the idea of two men being together is inherently absurd/oversexualized. These two straight men are making marginalized folks the punchline to their favorite ongoing joke. I know for me people making jokes like this made it harder to come out. I felt like I would never have access to a normative range of humanity. \n\nThen there's bringing a waiter into this mess! Absolutely inappropriate. It's kind of like how you don't practice kink in public without getting consent. \n\nThe only two potential issues I see on your side are: 1. this is probably something you should have talked to your husband about first and 2. there might be room for compromise. I think things like \"daddy\" and the nipple pinching etc. are out of line. Maybe the piggyback rides are fine when removed from the other context? It would be great if you could have a conversation with your husband and renegotiate boundaries together.\n\nI also think that the three of them are having kind of overblown reactions to what's described as a very calm \"this behavior is embarrassing\" discussion. But then again, it sounds like alcohol was likely involved for all parties.", "Geez. It's difficult to label you T.A. because your feelings are your feelings and you have a right to express them. The problem seems to be the communcation or better your lack of communication for a long time. In their view your husband and his friend did nothing special, just behaving like they have been doing for years and years and you obviously had never raised any concern about it in the past (you \"always laughed it off in the past\"). So your reaction obviously came as a surprise to everybody. And you didn't even bother to tell your husband directly, he had to learn it from his friend who learned it from his wife. Yup, you are \u201csuddenly making an issue of something that wasn\u2019t an issue all these years\u201d. More realisticly, it has been an issue for you for a long time but you failed to communicate it.", "NTA but boy do we have some bad news for you\u2026", "My opinion took a definitive shift when they brought this shit out in front of the waiter. Ick. NTA", "NTA, they may be joking that they're a couple in public, but your husband needs to understand that that's disrespectful towards you, the person he's actually a couple with. If they were just being affectionate with each other, it might not be a problem, but the fact that they acknowledge that what they're doing makes them look like a couple and still go on ahead with it is kind of insulting to you. Your husband embarrassed you in public by making it look like you're all in a poly relationship together, misrepresenting your relationship to strangers, and that's not ok. This \"joke\" seems to be going too far, it's starting to look like you ARE in a poly relationship you didn't sign up for.", "NTA. this reminds me of a BORU where the the wife married her brothers \"friend\" and was in complete denial that her brother and husband were gay lovers.", "NTA  I read this as \"every time they go out, the 2 guys are sort of a spectacle with the \"affectionate\" behavior\".  \n\nIt sounded like after five years or so of this, OP asked the other guy's wife \"Are you OK with this?\" to try to gauge how Other Wife felt, and for OP to see \"Is this behavior strange to everyone, or just to me?\"\n\nOther Wife chose to roast OP.\n\nYou know what? It's OK for OP to sometimes want to go out WITHOUT the whole show. Maybe if there were a couple of dinners that didn't have ass slapping and nipple pinching, OP wouldn't feel this way.\n\nBut it really does sound like  Husband and Alex put on the *\"LOOK AT US!\"* SHOW all the time.\n\nMen sharing affection is fine. Men performing what sounds like a roster of \"What People Think Gay Guys Do\" is not.   \n\nThe waiter isn't there for fun. It's his job, and in many places, much of what they earn is via tips.  If he doesn't \"play along\" or asks them to stop, they might not tip.  Not fair to include other people in this kind of \"game\"/behavior who can't really ask you to stop.\n\nOP is asking if maybe they shouldn't do this in public, in front of strangers that might not get the joke.   \n\nI think the answer is YES.  I think people would be uncomfortable with Speedo Wrestling on the beach, but might not want to say anything for fear of being labelled as homophobic.  \n\nWhen I go to the beach, I want to sit and talk to my friends, not watch/hear some guys bro-ing around.\n\nI don't think OP \"ruined a good thing\" as her husband has accused. I think they were over the top, and are butt hurt on being called on it.\n#YMMV", "NTA. OP, you need to trust your feelings on this. You have already said you feel humiliated by his behavior. What else may occur that bothers you or makes you feel so strongly? A good partner will take your feelings into account. Doesn\u2019t look like he is. You really need to decide if this is the way you want to live the rest of your life. Do you want to feel humiliated or wary every time you go out with these friends? Do want to constantly feel disrespected as his wife? These are questions you need to ask yourself. Only you can decide the next step.", "NTA. If your husband\u2019s friend was a woman then nobody would think twice about calling this behavior inappropriate.  Why isn\u2019t he cuddling YOU on the couch and being all romantic with YOU in public?  The way he\u2019s acting with his friend is not cute or funny, it\u2019s disrespectful to you and your relationship. \n\nAnd as someone said above, pretending to be gay as a joke is derogatory and discriminatory. Would it be funny if they walked around pretending to be Chinese or disabled?  Wtf?  These are grown ass men. You are not wrong to expect better.", "NTA\n\nBut OP, there's really only one thing to do here. If you can't beat em, join em. And by that I mean apologize to your husband and Alex and then reeeeaaallly lean into their \"joking around\". If your husband ever calls you his wife when you're out with Alex, then deny it. Call yourself the side-piece, the family accountant, his step-sister, literally anything but his wife. And shut down any pda from husband. No hand holding, no kissing, no hugs, no arm thrown around the shoulder. Tell him you don't want to get between him and his daddy. I'd like to see how long he lasts before it gets to him.\n\nYou don't have to have to do any of this btw. I'm a slightly vindictive person and this is just what I would do in your situation \ud83d\ude05", "NTA this sounds creepy to me the joking is 1 thing 2 grown married men cuddling while watching tv for hours. There is something not right about that.", "NTA\n\nI feel like you're the beard op. People don't do this unless they're having sexual/intimate relationship with each other and I'd gtfo", "Um, NTA, but that is the least of your worries, sis.", "You husband is factually Bi. If you can't see it then no one can help you", "You haven\u2019t seen everything, because you haven\u2019t seen them fucking, which they are definitely doing.", "NTA but the behavior is odd and not just being more open. Flipping the genders I still think that kind of talk is inappropriate in public. In private, that\u2019s one thing but out in public anyone calling anyone Daddy is way to close kink. Most people would not consent to seeing people say the words your husband and his best friend did.", "NTA  yes, disrespectful to the LGBTQ community.  Not to mention stupid and juvenile.  Keep it at home if you have to do it!", "I had a boy best friend who flirted w EVERYONE like this, all his friends. Difference? He toned certain behaviors down when he was told it made someone uncomfortable. \n\nEspecially when he got in relationships for respect of his gf\u2019s. \n\nThis is child\u2019s play. NTA", "I think YTA for not discussing this with your husband alone. And I kind of feel like he and his friend are AH too. Like\u2026IDK, their behavior feels sort of like it\u2019s mocking toward same sex relationships somehow. Almost like a caricature of how people portray gay men.", "NTA \n\nBut you should have talked to your husband first \n\nI think one of the issues is that there is such bias against straight men showing each other physical affection - I think that maybe they are playing into \u201cthe joke\u201d because that is the only legitimate way they see to express their deep affection towards each other  \n\nBut yeah, sounds like some boundaries can be explored here \n\nIf you can afford it, I\u2019d recommend a (good) couples therapist just for this issue - because I\u2019m sure there is a way for your husband to be expressive but also for you to be comfortable", "YTA. You were fully aware that your husband interacted with his friend like this when you married him. If you have a problem with it, fine--- maybe you're entitled to talk to your husband about it. Instead, you chose to complain over drinks to the friend's wife and start a big argument. Maybe there would be an argument anyway if you and your husband have such opposite opinions about this, but you ensured there would have to be one by complaining about your husband behind his back over drinks.", "You've known him for five years. He's known his friend for assumedly way longer than that.\n\nI'd say \"don't make it weird for them\" but you already have. Although it's certainly unusual for grown men to cuddle that's frankly probably much healthier than the current social norm. The daddy thing, too, is odd (I be don't personally care for any gender doing that) but they probably just find it funny.\n\nFrankly your YTA moment was talking to friend's wife about this instead of BF. That's what got so many people involved and made everything so awkward--BF feels like you're talking about him behind his back and judging him. And you are. If you'd just talked to BF one on one and asked him to tone down certain items in public I don't think there would have been nearly as much as an issue.", "YTA\n\nThis is their relationship dynamic and you knew that. \n\nThere is no disrespect here and you know that - you\u2019ve made it about you when it\u2019s not and damaged what sounded like a great group that had a lot of fun together. \n\nWho cares what a random waiter thinks if you\u2019re actually happy and certain in your marriage?", "YTA, friends do weird stuff. You know they're extremely close and this has been going on for a long time. I could somewhat understand where you were coming from if this were an issue of you being worried that your husband isn't straight and has the hots for his best friend, however you directly state that there's no doubt in your mind that he's straight. You should probably apologize to your husband and Alex for how you approached the situation, it'd be wise to sit down and talk with your husband in a civil manner, once he's had time to calm down too.", "YTA. If this was two women, no one would say boo. Guys shouldn\u2019t be shamed for being affectionate", "It's 2023, my friend. We keep telling men to embrace love and affection, we ecourage them to show other emotions towards each other besides anger, we tell them to form bonds and not be afraid to hug or kiss... and then we're weirded out when they actually do? I'm gonna have to agree with Alex's wife here : you are a little close minded. Your husband has someone who brings out the boy in him, who he has fun with and who he gets to be a little childish with. And that makes you uncomfortable because... what? A stranger might think they're a couple? That's the reason? Is a stranger's opinion of you or your family more important than your husband having a little harmless fun? \nMy advice? Blame it on the wine and get in on the joke. Gift them something like heart-shaped picture frames with photos of them, say you're sorry and next time you're bothered by the daddy thing just say \"Hey, I'm the only one who gets to call him that\" or something... \nGet over yourself and let boys be boys.

Don't know if I can change that.", "They have always been like this and it only started bothering me in the last year or so. I didn't say anything before because of what you said : I felt like I was the only one bothered by it and didn't want to create a problem. Good job me, I guess.", "I agree.  NTA.", "Agree with your thoughts, 100%.", "If the friend was female OP would have shut it down years ago. And they would have been an asshole for doing so. You can have an physically affectionate relationship with your friends.", "Tell your husband to imagine you doing this with a 'guy' best friend. Friends are friends right, gender shouldn't matter, would he find it funny?", "There\u2019s also a big difference between joking around in private and dragging their waiter into it \ud83d\ude2c", "See: it has been bothering you for a long time. And if we bottle something up for a long time the first time we actually make ourselves heard may be quite a scene then. As petratishkovna already mentioned it also makes a big difference where and when they show their behaviour. You could have mentioned to him already a long time ago that you understand that he's so playful with his friend but that it embarresses you from time to time in public. Nothing that can't be fixed here if you all discuss this in an open and friendly manner.\n\n\"I hoped they would grow out of it, I guess. They're not boys anymore...\"\n\nNope. That's what they are: boys at heart. Sorry. :)", "I was wondering too and starting to doubt my own \ud83d\udc40", "The perfect crime often includes hiding in plain sight.  It\u2019s easy to explain away as he does.  If he was sneaking off to do it in secret he would eventually get caught.", "I'm a woman who loves all my women friends and I would never do half of this shit with them. Biting their ears? Pinching their nipples? Slapping their asses? Wtf? If I saw two people doing that in front of me, I would think \"bruh, save your foreplay for the bedroom\". Doesn't matter if it was two men or two women. You think these actions are normal affectionate actions and doing them is \"bashing taboos\"? What taboos?", "That\u2019s a fair perspective as well. Reading about the behavior made me feel like it was sort of mocking. But, maybe they just bro out that way.", ">Friends do weird stuff, I agree. But 35yo men\n\nYes, even 35 year old men. There is no age limit on weirdness or inside jokes with close friends. And what people who don't know you think when you are out together should not matter to you.\n\nMy husband is 43 (I'm 39) we have been married for over 15 years (together almost 18). He has 2 friends he is super close ro. They have been friends since before I met my husband.\n\nMy hubby and these friends are all married with kids.  None of them have romantic feelings for each other. But whenever we get together (and yes - even in public places) they are all a little crazy with each other. They refer to each other as \"cupcake\", \"wifey\" and \"boo\". Joke around with each other, order each other's food and drinks, give each other huge bear hugs (where they are literally picking each other up off the gtound) and have even kissed each other on the forehead/cheek. \n\nI have no problem with this and often laugh along. The other wives are the same. We joke with each other and will often say that we don't plan couple date nights - instead us wives plan play dates for our husbands so we can enjoy a margarita!", "35 year old men? Let me tell you, I know PLENTY who behave in a ridiculous manner, for better or for worse. Some of which happen to be my closest friends. Others don't have to know that they express their friendship that way. You know, don't you? You shouldn't let others' opinions lead you to criticize something as harmless as that, especially behind your husband's back.\n\nTry looking at it from his perspective. \n\nThat's his best friend. Just like women do, men have best friends. We all act differently with different friends because everyone bonds uniquely. For example, maybe Alex is like my \"Hayden\". I have other friends, but \"Hayden\" and I have a unique chemistry. We do crazy things for fun, we don't care what people think of us. That's because WE know that WE'RE friends and WE'RE the ones with an unbreakable bond. Get it? I'm not trying to be mean, I'm trying to find the words to help you get why they're behaving like that.", "If it's the post I'm remembering, she was bi and had previously dated the woman. Completely different scenario", "tbh I think your husband is the one displaying homophobia here with his need to make constant homoerotic jokes. Two straight men who think homoerotic behavior is the funniest punchline ever\u2026 leaves a very bad taste in my mouth", "I\u2019m completely with you. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with any of this behavior either. It\u2019s is extremely immature.", "So why didn't you bring that up to your husband in private instead of trying to get the other wife on your side? Honestly, this is a YOU problem that you need to find ways to come to terms with. You knew you were signing up for this, you do not just get to all of the sudden demand that it stop.", "So if you can\u2019t change that about you, they should change how they behave. Fair enough. /s", "if i was the waiter i would have found it funny tbh", "I have never seen other grown men behave like this so it is nice to hear that it's not just them. Any advice how to stop caring what others might think? I don't wanna be a party pooper...", "I understand, thank you.", "I don\u2019t remember if the gf was bi, but the had never dated", "I wasn't planning on making any demands, I was maybe hoping that Alex's wife would agree and we could both talk to them somehow. But instead she ratted me out and now I'm the one who ruined the weekend and probably more... and I feel like that's unfair. Idk why. Maybe I don't fully agree that I'm in the wrong.", "Ok, different post than", "Why are you talking to her instead of your husband?\n\nAnswer - you want her to help gang up on your respective husbands"]}
