If they know how to change a diaper and feed a baby they must be capable of determining when food is finished cooking. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s reasonable to expect your step kids to take care of your baby even if it\u2019s only for a few minutes but at their ages, it it is reasonable to expect them to finish preparing their own breakfast.", "ESH. Your timing was backwards. \"Change the baby or no water park!\" would likely have gotten the desired results. Now they'll just be bitter towards you.", "ESH. I agree that it is difficult managing a baby and being a SAHM while teen boys can\u2019t help. Unfortunately, a lot of teen boys are like this. I noticed in one of your replies that their mother passed away. It may be really hard for them to accept their father having a new wife and child with that wife. Taking away a fun experience with them because they won\u2019t care for your child will continue to divide your relationship even further.", "YTA. the boys resent you. they probably think everything revolves around Angelina now that she\u2019s born and they\u2019re going to resent her.

Their actions do suck, but graunding them because of it might backfire and they may become distant to their sister even more.", "ESH. The boys sound as if they're acting out because they have difficulty forming a relationship with the two of you. I can honestly understand that. But you're the adult here and shouldn't refuse taking them because of that. Wasn't the point of taking them to try to get a little closer and bond with them? Taking Angelina while making them stay home is definitely the opposite of that.", "NTA. They don't get to treat you like that and still expect rewards. You were cooking breakfast and they couldn't get off their asses for 5 minutes? They definitely didn't deserve water park privileges. Totally not the asshole.", "NTA I love Reddit wants people to accept shit behavior because \u201cyou\u2019re the parent\u201d.

They are practically adults! Do you expect them to want her, at 3 years old, to go to the bar with you and them for their first drink?

I don't want to assume anything, mine is a question to try to understand where this hatred towards you can come from", "Saying that and proving that to them are two very different things.

The boys showed that she can't rely on them at all. Also, since they obviously can't stand to be near them, they should have been glad the trip was canceled for them.", "I don't think parents should rely on someone else's children to provide basic care for their child.", "Well, in that case she shouldn't have to make dinner for those other children who are not hers. Usually families help each other. Being a family is a shared environment, not a business operation where everything is paid and earned."]}
