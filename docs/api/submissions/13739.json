He\u2019s the one who has responsibilities to everyone concerned and he apparently hasn\u2019t taken the initiative to develop a cohesive family environment. You\u2019re secondarily close to being the asshole because you\u2019re an adult who chose a man with 3 kids so you accepted a fair amount of responsibility yourself.

They are selfish they think what the heck is s stranger doing here disturbing the nice life we had.", "I interpreted that as meaning encouraging them after a period of limited/no interaction. \n\nI may be completely wrong, hopefully OP can clarify at some point. \n\nAin't the English language grand? Lol.", "No.  They get lots of help.  They don't want to give any.  None at all!  What is the point of trying to define the help they refuse to do in the most extreme possible terms?  All around, I strongly disagree, you need to let up.  Family is about compromise and mutual support.", "I mean they could, but obviously they don\u2019t know wtf they are doing otherwise they would be making breakfast.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me that all of you can\u2019t look at the fact that 3 boys won\u2019t help their sister but they would be willing to cook breakfast for everyone lol.\n\nThese kids are shit heads", "And yeah I don\u2019t think majority of young teens have mastered anything in the kitchen, that\u2019s wild.", "OP said they were all playing a game while she made food for them, baby cried, no kids helped or even considered helping with either. \n\nThey won\u2019t help w sibling so clearly they aren\u2019t going to help anyone else get their food. They are all selfish.", "Also not the breakfast that 90% of people would make a house of teenagers.", "I love how you jump to none of those things are hard to make\u2026 neither is helping out with your sibling. \n\nFar easier for one of them to help w sibling than be responsible for the outcome of everyone\u2019s breakfast\u2026 because guess what?? If it comes out like shit, then who is going to have to get back in the kitchen to make it right?", "LOL, yeah and I bet at 14 you had the decency to cater to your young sibling if you had one. That\u2019s great that you could cook at 14 but it\u2019s naive to assume every 14 year old does. Because that\u2019s not the case what do ever. \n\nShe was cooking breakfast for a minimum of 5 people. Idk why we are under valuing that.", "Wow I just saw your rack of lambs w pistachio and pesto crust post. You are someone who actually seems like they appreciate cooking and you\u2019re trying to sit here and counter this? Yeah man I would assume you could make crepes at 10 with your posts and I bet you cook at family gatherings, and I bet you wouldn\u2019t eat the shit that your cousin cooks cause he is known for over cooking.", "Yeah, I\u2019m a Gen Xer, and I have been making myself comment - regardless of downvotes - because the utter selfishnesses and lack of common sense often displayed on Reddit is both astonishing and alarming.", "You put words in my mouth. I specified it like this because OP literally HAS TEENAGE ***\\*\\*BOYS\\*\\****", "Oh behave, you tried to twist this persons comments to look sexist and then got confused why they\u2019re defensive", "It is absolutely misbehaving for teenage minors to refuse to assist their stepmother with their infant sister. See also how Dad agreed with stepmom. \n\nIn what works did you grow up that you think it is for teenagers to not help around their own home?\n\nOP isn\u2019t making them raise the child. OP was cooking breakfast (presumably also for them) and needed help with the baby.", "To be petty and make a point.\n\nIf they\u2019d gone to the water park she\u2019d be pouting they didn\u2019t spend all day on the baby splash pad with Angelina and acted like teen boys at a water park.\n\nThey are not going to bond with their half sister. By the time she is toddler the youngest will be young men graduated high school.", "I feel sorry for parents at the pool. A they can do is put the baby in a swim jumpsuit with a large hat and push them around in an infant inner tube. Seems boring to me. The wave pool and lazy river are usually too rough and they are too young for any slides. The parents usually pack up and leave after an hour", "Same, live south of Orlando but literally reading this on the trip home from a Disney water park so DenseYear2017\u2019s comment REALLY threw me off.", "They are teenagers. It\u2019s not surprising that teenagers have zero interest in a new born baby. The age gap is so large, half sibling or not, they will probably never have a close relationship. Can\u2019t force that.", "Then she should not cook or clean or do laundry for them....boundaries are important.", "Those boys should never have to change the babies diaper. It\u2019s one thing to help, but not that.", "If you read my response to OP you\u2019ll see that I said the boys need to do something to help out. The point of my comment is when the boys said they wouldn\u2019t change the baby\u2019s diaper OP should have said: \u201cfine, then I need you to finish making breakfast\u201d. Why are you attacking me over one phrase?", "I don\u2019t think I have enough info. Blended families is hard shit. It is tough when you\u2019re at a 13 or 17 and all dad cares about is his new wife and baby. They might have good reason to be surely.", "This is why people under appreciate the value of food. Just because you weren\u2019t getting fire breaky doesn\u2019t mean others weren\u2019t.", "Yes, at 14 I could - and often did - change and care for a baby. I was CPR and first aid certified and had been babysitting and cooking for years.\n\nMy wife and I have raised three kids who are now teens - 16, 16 & 19 - and the only one who could not cook the sort of breakfast you describe unassisted at 14 is one of the twins. All three are autistic, but he also has some cognitive developmental delays. He can, however, make things like pancakes and scrambled eggs, and could absolutely have watched the food to make sure it didn\u2019t burn for the amount of time it took to change a baby when he was that age. Despite being disabled and, at the time, nonspeaking, both boys and my disabled godson, for whom I cared, could make grilled cheese, scrambled eggs, chicken nuggets, toast and baked French fries by age FIVE. You act like high schoolers are preschoolers - plenty of kids at those ages literally WORK IN KITCHENS as their first real jobs.\n\nIf a near-adult (17) or a 14-year-old cannot **watch the stove** for a matter of **MINUTES** at that age, that\u2019s a huge problem. And major failing on their father\u2019s part. *Watching the stove for a few minutes to make sure breakfast doesn\u2019t burn isn\u2019t generally a super involved task and there is ZERO reason to assume she was making the sort of gourmet meal served in high end restaurants.* \n\nWhy do people make excuses for boys that allow them to jog confidently down the road of weaponized incompetence? Two of those three teens will be adults in less than a year. Is stepmom going to be making their breakfasts for them in college?", "If any of my cousins were known to over cook food, I would eat it, just like I eat any over cook food made by someone who takes the time to host me and cook for me (or a child/teen learning to cook). \n\nI have manners.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve also just over cooked my veggies by responding to you, and I\u2019ll still happily eat them, because they\u2019re food. Not everything is a pistachio-coated rack of lamb.", "Well apparently from what I noticed, you don\u2019t have to things for anyone if you don\u2019t want to. If you are a parent or step/bonus parent you have to take care and devote yourself to little human because well\u201dyou\u2019re the adult \u201c and please don\u2019t be a step/bonus parent because you didn\u2019t have a fighting chance either way it goes..", "Or you could just answer something like, \" I meant teenagers in general\" . Instead of \"get over yourself\". If it isn't the case, why do you feel triggered? Would you write a comment exactly like: no teenage girl wants to change diapers. If you wouldn't, it is indeed sexist. If you would, just say that instead of feeling offended and become aggressive.", "They are over a decade apart in age. Half siblings or not, no surprise that teenagers have zero interest in a new born baby. You can\u2019t force a relationship on them. I never changed a babies diaper or fed one and i would never want to. I just think that is asking a lot. That\u2019s what parents should do. OP should have requested them to watch the food In kitchen instead.", "Because it's inflammatory and totally derails the rest of your point.  It's also typical Reddit single-mindedness that one should check.", "I didn\u2019t realize my cooking pancakes at 12 made me a prodigy.", "Why are you comparing your life to the majority of the world? \n\nThat is great your kids can.. but the point of this post is those kids can\u2019t. Or likely just won\u2019t. \n\nThey won\u2019t change a diaper or look after their sister, why the hell would they take responsibility for everyone\u2019s breakfast?", "Or you could just not pull something out of your ass to try and twist a comment to seem sexist. You were clearly trying to imply this comment was sexist otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have added \u2018because they have to just get used to it?\u2019. That\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t just a simple response", "How was that relying on children to provide basic care? It was picking up a crying Baby and feeding their half sister.\nChild's need to learn that in life we sometimes have to do stuff we don't want to do", "It sounds like the one being extreme is you", "I never said you were a prodigy, but the guy who changed the game with designed pancakes, now that guy is special.", "Diaper changing and feeding are basic child care.", "I just politely pointed out your position is extreme with a single line, and then you got all hot and bothered about it, hehe, its kinda funny tbh", "Yes of course I meant the once she asked them. It's hardly her expecting them to take care of their half sister need all the time"]}
