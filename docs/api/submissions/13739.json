He\u2019s the one who has responsibilities to everyone concerned and he apparently hasn\u2019t taken the initiative to develop a cohesive family environment. You\u2019re secondarily close to being the asshole because you\u2019re an adult who chose a man with 3 kids so you accepted a fair amount of responsibility yourself.

But the minute you add the word step, to child, parent, sibling, hackles seem to rise automatically and assume the step to be in the wrong.", "Yes parenthood in all senses comes in many different ways. But people here people think because \u201cyou\u2019re the adult \u201c or you \u201c choose to be there\u201d a person has to let the step/bonus kids do whatever and that person should just give give give.. and I\u2019m sick of this \u201c the child don\u2019t have to help out\u201d. Parents bend over backwards to provide for their kids, bonus or not. To ask a person you\u2019re providing everything thing for, for a small favor and they can\u2019t do it is crazy..", "I have a question for that. So if the child doesn\u2019t see a step parent and anything but whoever\u2019s spouse, is it ok for that person not to buy them anything , cook for them, take them anywhere. Like anything a parent would do. Because as whoever\u2019s spouse, wouldn\u2019t the spouse only be obligated to the spouse.", "Which is why she should find a sitter for the dang baby. This whole thing reeks of parental justification, where basically the baby *has to be* with Mommy at all times. Kid has two parents, and the step parent supposedly wants to spend time with the older kids. Common sense says Dad stays with the baby. Or is this still the 50s?", "But you are a SAHM so how were you paying for it? Plus how long have you been married? The baby is 5 months old so is she suddenly taking all their father's attention? They sound like they are mad about something and I think you need to do family therapy to figure it out. NTA for recinding the invite I guess.", "Op is neither parent nor guardian.", "*Especially* if she was presumably making breakfast for everyone. Asking for help for 10 min is not parentification.\n\nIf she's a doormat they will also continue to act like this.", "It's more about using the trip OP scheduled in an attempt to get closer and bond with the boys as a punishment after getting upset with them that I disagree with. Punish them in another way.", "It says husband is 37, so I don\u2019t think that would be a huge problem. I also wonder how long they went without a mother figure and either don\u2019t want one or maybe have an underlying fear/pain of her leaving.", "I'm seeing the top two as entirely different things. One is attempting to encourage the boys to spend time with their SM & sister, the other is asking them to perform a task. The difference between doing something with and doing something for? \n\nYou are assuming OP has no money because she is a SAHM? Maybe she has savings, maybe her husband financially compensates her for her contribution in the home. It isn't really anyone's business.", "It means they don\u2019t want to. I was trying to teach my brother to cook for himself at that age, he didn\u2019t care. His video games are the most important thing in his life. I used to get in trouble for not preparing his food when he couldn\u2019t be bothered to answer me when I asked what he wanted.\n\nAt the tender age of 26, he \u201ccooks\u201d now. Microwaveable foods and frozen stuff that goes in the oven. And his pb&j/cold cut sandwiches of course.", "Oh yeah so you\u2019re 14 year old can make a eggs Benedict w Hollandaise, diced potatoes w saut\u00e9ed onions and peppers, biscuits w country gravy, chx fried steak and eggs?? \nShe never said she was making cereal. Hell even flipping pancakes requires some sort of skill as to not burn or under cook. \n\nShe is cooking more multiple people which isn\u2019t an easy task to maintain all that. \n\nYou\u2019re under appreciating cooking. It takes skill to cook, and if you do t have skill or respect the food tastes like shit.", "Depends on if you are asking seriously or not. If you want to use crazy Reddit logic, based on how redditers view other\u2019s people\u2019s kids, then, yes, the mistreated step-parent could technically treat the disdainful child with zero consideration because \u201cnot their child.\u201d But then, those same redditers would scream bloody murder at the natural consequences of their rules because \u201cif you marry someone with kids, those kids are your family.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of redditers are kids who want their cake and eat it, too. They want to be able to walk all over a step-parent but also benefit from a step-parents help with food, chores, driving, money, holidays, presents, etc. It is a no-win situation for a step-parent here.", "And OP chose to not take them to a water park. I hope she chooses to have them make their own damn dinner too or ask daddy for take out", "So? They've been asked only 3 times in 5 months to help. They refuse, but they change nappies and help out neices, nephews, and cousins, but still refuse their own sister. It's not a big ask. If they don't wanna help with the baby, they could the over the food while she deals with the baby, but they're unwilling to do that too. Kids of that age who refuse to help even a little bit do not deserve days out at the waterpark.", "But they are choosing to take their father's decision to remarry out on the wife and half-sister. They could also have chosen to be decent teenagers without wanting to call her mom or treat her like a mom. Doesn't seem like that is what is being asked for by either dad or OP. It is not like OP broke up a happy home. Their mother died. Dad should not be expected to live without a companion forever just because the kids seem to expect it. But like so many of this current generation, everything is about what they want and what can be done for them. These boys obviously don't care if someone needed a few minutes of help while she was cooking their food. It was interrupting their \"me\" time. Their lack of common decency to others is what got them left home.", "For all we know, the baby could be exclusively breastfed for one reason or other. Sure, she *could* pump, but that requires time to build up a usable stash for dad to actually be able to use (assuming she actually responds to the pump and baby takes to the bottle). Might not be worth the pain and frustration to OP just for an outing.", "The baby is 5 months old. There\u2019s a decent chance baby is breastfed, so sure, baby needs to be with mom. Why does it bother you that a literal baby would be with her mother?", "Well they clearly they don't want anything to do with her or their half sister. She did them a favor by taking back the invite then.", "I agree and understand what you're saying, but on the other hand, personally with my kids I'd struggle because I'd feel disrespected by them just refusing to help, why should they then get to go have a blast of a day. Maybe rescheduling the trip would've been better?", "Moment they got to the park they would have dipped on step mom anyway. NTA", "So what? A lot of people can't cook and have no interest in doing so.", "ur acting like watching food cook to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn is rocket science chill out dude op never said what she was making so why is ur first assumption that she\u2019s making eggs benedict for teenagers", "None of the things you listed are super hard to cook especially if someone else has already done most of the work and you just had to watch it. Besides OP never said what she was cooking but I\u2019m sure if she was dealing with three teenagers and a baby it wasn\u2019t a super fancy meal. There were so many times during my teen years when my mom was cooking and had to leave the kitchen to take a phone call or even run to the store because she forgot an ingredient. She would tell me when I would know the food was done and what I should do when it was done. It took her 30 seconds and the food always came out great. You\u2019re underestimating what a teenager is capable of. If you can\u2019t cook or you struggled to learn, I\u2019m so sorry but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that these boys were more than capable of watching the stove or the over while OP took care of the baby.", "I was making Mahi eggs Benedict for my family on special occasions when I was 12. If their father had taught them how to cook, they would be plenty capable.", "Ok because that\u2019s what I\u2019m noticing\u2026 but I will mind my millennial business then.", "A splash pad and a water park are different things, aren\u2019t they?", "from what i understand from the post, the baby is not exclusively breastfed as op asked her stepsons to also feed the baby in addition to changing the baby. so i guess op already pumps or uses formula.", "Still doesn't dismiss the fact that commenting on someone else's opinion to explain every reason their wrong is stupid.", "I explained my view above. Commenting on my comments telling me why you think my *opinion* in a *verdict-based subreddit* is wrong is stupid.\n\nMy brain left out a couple words.", "You're not misbehaving to refuse yo be a free baby sitter for some lady your dad decides to marry. Those are teenage boys. You can't parlor trick them into believing op is their parent, or that they need jump up and help her whenever she asks.", "They did her a favor by saying no then. It's good to teach dad's wife you're not her free baby sitter. Boundaries are important.", "It\u2019s a basic life skill. \n\nThat\u2019s like saying a lot of people don\u2019t know how to bathe properly. So what?", "Its not about can its about want. Everyone can follow an easy recipe.\nAnd the microwave ready stuff is usually not very healthy", "I was answering the question with an example. No means to learn it simply means they don\u2019t want to.", "Getting mad because your opinion that you posted on a public forum was disagreed with is stupid, but here we are. That opinion is stupid, I responded. If you don\u2019t like being disagreed with, either don\u2019t post or don\u2019t read the responses.", "That is their sibling, their family member they were being asked to help with while waiting for step-mom to cook their food.\n\nPeople who live together help each other out, it is the height of entitlement to expect others to keep on doing things for you but you never contribute anything in return because PaReNtIfIcAtIoN which is not \"helping out\" but when kids are made to be the parents of their siblings.\n\nI feel like Reddit is full of entitled teens who expect everything from their parents while contributing nothing in return. What gross misunderstanding about the realities of life. The alienation of it all.", "It's not a free babysitter to ask for 10 minutes of help, less than once a month. \n\nLook, if I'm taking a shit, and my baby wakes up crying, my friends would jump to go grab her, so I could finish shitting ,And vice versa. \n\nOn top of that, getting a baby out of bed and changing their diaper takes maybe 5 minutes MAX.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "OP's post stated she was making breakfast and there's no indication she was being required to do so.\n\nBut yes, I agree that stating she wouldn't prepare their food would be a reasonable response. I disagree with the action she did take.", "So, stopping to provide basic care is reasonable, but taking away a treat is not? I don't get you, I'm glad of it."]}
