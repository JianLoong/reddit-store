You get to decide when your baby gets fed, her texting to say you're starving a child to avoid him throwing up in a car is literally crazy shit.\n\nShe doesnt' get to make choices over your baby's care because she's had kids before, that's not how that works.\n\nThe comments and attitude seem to be bordering on if not outright abusive, constantly trying to make you feel worse, constant criticising over nothing.

It\u2019s not uncommon for parents to live with their children and grandchildren. \n\nThat said, your husband needs to tell them that since you\u2019re \u201csuch a bad mom\u201d they shouldn\u2019t expect you to care for them when they\u2019re old and decrepit and keep reminding them\n\nNTA", "You're not taking her away from them. This is your child, not theirs. They literaly have no respect for how you parent your own child. They're the ones taking their grandchildren away with their behavior. Do not let THEM dictate how you raise your child. If anything, they're doing their utmost to take the child away from you. You deserve more respect than they are ever going to give you. Do NOT let them guilt you as you have done nothing wrong. Your child, not theirs. \n\nThey should be thankful they get to spend ANY time with the child. The whole \"but they're heyre still family\" notion of letting people get away with AH behavior is a toxic trait. Family still needs to earn respect, especially if they're constantly disrespecting you like they have been doing to you. You deserve better. Good luck to you.", "Thank you I just want peace. I know I can do better I mean today I accidentally bumped her head trying to lift her up she was wiggling so much her head fell back when I was lifting her so I know I can be better I just don\u2019t know if what they say is true I just know I love her and don\u2019t want to hurt her in anyway.", "You are doing great. They're the ones putting these thoughts in your head. Bumps and bruises will happen and will heal. What they say, which will of course have some truth, is not always going to be right. Some things you mentioned showed that they were trying to 1-up you and not help you but put you down. Believe in yourself. You know in your heat what is best for your child. If you try to do something, and they disagree, ask them why they say that. You'll tell by HOW they say things to you if they're being helpful or trying to be better than you. Trust yourself. You got this.", "Tell him that's what you need him to do. If he also agrees with all of this anyway, it shouldn't be an issue.", "You are not the first or last parent that has bumped their kid.  Stop saying you can do better.  You need to start believing that you are a good mother and you are doing a good job.  And yes definitely get out for a while."]}
