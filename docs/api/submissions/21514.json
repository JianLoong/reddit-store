You get to decide when your baby gets fed, her texting to say you're starving a child to avoid him throwing up in a car is literally crazy shit.\n\nShe doesnt' get to make choices over your baby's care because she's had kids before, that's not how that works.\n\nThe comments and attitude seem to be bordering on if not outright abusive, constantly trying to make you feel worse, constant criticising over nothing.
