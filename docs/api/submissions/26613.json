She should talk to somebody about that.\n\nAbsurd.", "NTA\n\nThis is exactly how you should deal with a situation like this.", "OP this is hilarious and I think it\u2019s a lighthearted way to deal with a really annoying behavior. \n\nIt is clear your wife feels inadequate, and maybe that is something to look into.", "This is great. I would love to hear more examples of you helping out with the lies lol. People that constantly have to top story's are the worst.", "NAH, this is a great way to handle this thing that annoys you and ultimately is in good fun. Besides, you\u2019ve had enough challenges as a family feeding your giants and dealing with wild medical issues while ultimately surmounting all those obstacles to have both children end up valedictorians for life. You\u2019re arms must be sore from all the high fives ;)", "NTA!\n\nThis is some funny ass shit. Why not? A lie is a lie is a lie. People have *surely* caught onto this by now. I would say, in this particular case, a little public ridicule might be warranted if she is going so above and beyond as to lie about one kid's balls and the other kid being a valedictorian. Don't care much about the height thing... my mom is 5'2\" and calls everyone 7 feet tall, so I'm willing to chalk that up to just silly exaggeration.", "NTA, but the lying on her part is actually kind of a concern.  Why lie?  If she is this insecure, perhaps she needs a little therapy.", "NTA\n\nI think this is brilliant.  The only thing is, if she likes to one up people she might try to top your ridiculous lie with an even more ridiculous lie and who knows where that'll end up.\n\nSeriously though, white lies are still lies and if she can't stop herself she probably needs professional help.  If people know she lies a lot then they're likely to stop believing anything she says.", "LOL. ESH You're both acting like AHs but it sounds really entertaining.", "nta", "NTA\nI don\u2019t blame you for snapping and doing what you did but it sounds like your wife needs some help and she\u2019s not going to understand that unless you sit her down and ask why she feels the need to lie. Because it\u2019s not normal behavior.", "NTA OP.  I'd love to see this in action.\n\nI'm curious why you think lying constantly is harmless?  Do your kids like knowing they're apparently second rate and can't live up to her lies?  That what they actually achieve isn't good enough?  That their mother is do ashamed of them she'd rather lie about their abilities than be proud of what and who they actually are?  Might be a way to get her to stop entirely versus just being ashamed when you make her obvious lies into ludicrous lies.", "NTA\n\nI want to be your friend.\n\nYour wife's lies are not harmless. They are pathological. Have you ever asked her why she feels the need to lie all the time? I wonder if she knows that there are probably zero people in her orbit that trust her anymore.\n\nMy sister is a pathological liar. She will lie even when the truth is perfectly harmless and acceptable. I don't understand, but I stopped believing anything she says a long time ago. She lost all of her friends because of her lying. Nobody wants to be around that nonsense.", "Love this! I hope she is getting a chuckle of you one-upping her better than she is one-upping others.

Especially for something so easily proved wrong, like the kid\u2019s height or daughter being valedictorian, your whole family looks ridiculous when she lies and that\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s like the impulse to one up them is so irresistible she doesn\u2019t even think about the consequences.
