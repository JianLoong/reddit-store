Whatever her motives for embarrassing him in public, at least she's not doing it to him deliberately, out of malice.", "You are grasping so many straws that you may single handedly undo all our efforts to go straw-less for a better environment.\n\nEnjoy your self made up story of OP\u2019s life.", "I read she had a pet snake that she named Emily Spinach and she would carry the snake around, wrapped about her arm. Incredible.", "And he made it pretty clear which job was more likely to bear fruit.", "We say oh they\u2019ve been to Elevenarife (instead of Tenerife)", "Emily Spinach was named that because she was as green as spinach and as thin as Alice\u2019s Aunt Emily, which I find hilarious. I bet Aunt Emily didn\u2019t think so though.", "Many of Alice's antics were exaggerated by newspapers and tabloids at the time, but she wasn't called \"the Other Washington Monument\" for nothing!\n\nThe story about her father saying he could run the country or raise Alice (but not both) is sort of apocryphal. There are conflicting accounts as to what context under which he originally uttered the phrase, but it's fairly well-recorded that he loved repeating stories about her wherein that phrase was the punchline.\n\nShe did have a pet snake named Emily Spinach, but Emily Spinach was a harmless garden snake which she kept inside a shoebox. The story of her draping the snake around her arm while trying to board a train was one she vehemently denied in her middle-aged years (though she seemed to relish in her youthful infamy when she became older). Similarly, contrary to many reports, she did not break into the White House and curse Nellie Taft with a voodoo doll........ That was Woodrow Wilson. For Nellie Taft, she merely buried it in the snow and allowed Nellie to discover it ominously on White House grounds once the snow had melted.\n\nAnother great one is during a trip to Asia, her boat made a stop in San Francisco. Upset with (then-Secretary of War) William Taft, who had been assigned to keep an eye on her, she took a revolver and began firing at the nearby telegram poles. She was so fussy during the trip that her maid had a nervous breakdown, and she went swimming in front of a sitting Congressman in nothing but her undergarments (scandal!!!). She received so many expensive gifts from various high-ranking Asian officials that one newspaper ran the headline \"Alice in Plunderland\".\n\nI really do think President Carter said it best: *\"She had style, she had grace, and she had a sense of humor that kept generations of political newcomers to Washington wondering which was worse\u2014to be skewered by her wit or to be ignored by her. \u201c*", "She would be *such* a redditor nowadays lmao\n\nI dunno, Emily Spinach sounds like some shit someone with a tumblr would come up with haha", "Yeah you know what? I would have been sad if Teddy fuckin Roosevelt had some normal privaledeged life kids.", "Well I read that she had two snakes named Emily Arugula and Emilio Kale\u2026and she would carry them uphill in the snow both ways.", "That makes the whole thing so much better.", "> Aunt Emily didn\u2019t think so though\n\nshe indeed did not!  I believe Alice and her mother did not get along well with Aunt Emily so the name was a way of being... uncivil, shall we say lol", "It took me too long to realize you meant \u201cshe cursed the voodoo doll of Woodrow Wilson\u201d and not \u201cWoodrow Wilson made a voodoo doll of Nellie Taft.\u201d", "Wait, if it's recorded that he said it a lot, how is it apocryphal?", ":For Nellie Taft, she merely buried it in the snow and allowed Nellie to discover it ominously on White House grounds once the snow had melted.\"\n\nStone-cold genius.", "She sounds like she would be such a cool friend.", "As someone not very familiar with US history, I kinda love her.", "She would be the most glorious twitter troll", "She sounds far too cool to waste her time on Reddit.", "Maybe he once said something kinda like the quote, then someone paraphrased it into something more pithy, and Teddy liked the new version and began using it. \"No, I didn't say that, but I wish I had, and I'm gonna start now.\"", "Like James blunt level of hilarious lol"]}
