So she is upset because she feels like the gifts I get her lose all special meaning because I 'share' them with my family.

I plan to use 2 tickets for me and her for her birthday and the other 2 for my mum and brother to see it on a different day. \nShe's now saying that the gift I got for her has stopped being quite as special because she wasn't the only one I thought of when I got them. \nShe's then gone on to say I've done this every time I've sorted something for her birthday because the times I've done something, I've used the tickets to take my brother or mum after. We've gone out and done something and because there's still time left, whether it's a convention or something, I've taken someone else. \n I don't understand the problem. I'm getting the most out of my money and the gift but she's really upset about it.

She wants her birthday to be about her.  Instead, you're getting a group of tickets and giving them to all kinds of people including her.  You sound like a kind person who likes to do things for others, which is wonderful, but it's not something special for HER.\n\nIn your example, you got 4 tickets to a play she wanted to see.  Two were for you and her for her birthday, and two were for your mom and brother.  Was it their birthdays too?  Or a special occasion for them?  Because if not, you did a nice thing for your mom, your brother, and your GF.  There was nothing that made it a special birthday present for her.\n\nMaybe people think this is selfish on her part, but she wants something special that you don't do for everyone else too.  She wants to feel special on her birthday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add - I just saw OP's comment that **he and his GF have been together for THREE AND A HALF YEARS**.  And he's still doing this.  The only 3 times he's ever organized anything have been for her birthdays, and he's fucked them up.  That poor woman.  I honestly have no idea why she's still with him.", "YTA. A gift for your SO should not also always be a gift for your freaking family. No wonder she's upset. You aren't getting the most out of your money in her eyes. You are definitely NOT treating her as if she actually matters to you though. A special gift/occasion for her should be for HER. Not everyone you bloody well know.", "YTA. When I was 9 my dad got bikes for everyone on my birthday. I\u2019m 31 and still have not forgotten.", "YTA. A gift is supposed to make someone feel special, not like a financial opportunity that dilutes her experience.  I'm confused as to why you're confused. Seems like you're being obtuse.", "Was going to say N T A  but your edit said you\u2019ve only organised 3 things for her and on all 3 occasions you\u2019ve taken or involved others. So I\u2019ve changed my mind and YTA.", "You are not getting the most out of your money - what you are doing is getting the most out of your own time.  You spend time researching and planning something that not only your girlfriend, but also your mother and brother would enjoy.  You aren't thinking 'hey what would my girlfriend like the most' but 'what one thing can I get everyone so I don't have to think of what my girlfriend would like the most'.  The fact that you ONLY do this for her birthday only goes to show that you don't put in effort unless you really have to.  If you arranged concert tickets for your brother birthday but also got some for her at least it would be equal - but you only ever plan things with her when you have to, but also use it for your mother and brother shows that you are putting in minimum effort.  YTA.", "YTA they don't feel special because they aren't about her. Also she may not say it, but not everyone wants to spend their birthday with the inlaws. Try doing something specifically for her. \n\nHow would you feel if you got a promotion at work but it was just a raise that they gave everyone across the board? To me it would feel a little like I got cheated out of the promotion.", "YTA a bit. It comes off as less of a birthday gift when you also get it as a 'just because' gift for your family at the same time. When you buy your family gifts, does she also get one? It's just a bit odd to consistently get your family the same things you get her at the same time and makes it seem less like a birthday present and more just like an experience you're getting for everyone. It sounds like she would appreciate the focus on her birthday being on her. If you take her to a convention for her birthday and then she leaves and you're staying and have someone else come take over her spot, that's pretty odd and makes it seem like the day isn't about her, it's about you maximizing the time/people you're at the convention with. Birthdays should generally be focused on the person whose birthday it is, so instead of her leaving and you continuing to enjoy her present (convention example) leave with her and go spend time with her. The way you're doing it makes it seem like you planned to see a play (and wanted your family to see it too) and it happened to be her birthday as well so you invited her. It does not come off as a present for her as much as you.", "Everyone is saying NTA but honestly. Its tacky and sad that you dont just think of your GF. You have to include someone else and to me it wouldnt matter that its a different day. You didnt get her a birthday gift for her , and you never seem to. Thats sad YTA", "YTA\n\nWas it your mom and brothers birthdays too? \n\nA gift is something special between you and the person you give it to. How is it special if your mom and brother are also tagging along at your expense? \n\nYou are also sending a clear message that you don\u2019t want to attend an event alone with her. That sucks. \n\nHas your girlfriend ever mentioned that she has concerns with you and your moms relationship? I see a big red flag here. It seems like an unhealthy lack of boundaries.\n\nBuying 4 tickets instead of two is not making the most value out of your money\u2026 you are simply paying more money.", "YTA - Why get them the same? You should be thinking of her when choosing her birthday gift, not you, or your family members.

Not only do you rarely ever organize anything, but when you do, you give the same gift to other people. You're including your family in her birthday present.

The fact that you don't understand why this upsets your girlfriend says a lot about how little you value her.", "INFO : \n\nHow is that getting the most of the gifts you give her ?  You aren't sneaking more people in on the same set of tickets.", "I think she wants you to do something that is just specifically for her.  Her birthday is her day to feel special.  To feel like you are going to an extra effort to do something nice and meaningful for her and her alone.  \n\nIf you can\u2019t bring yourself to just buy tickets for you and her to attend a show, how about trying to get her a different kind of present.  Take her out to dinner at a really nice restaurant.  Do not take your mother and brother to the same restaurant the week afterwards.  Buy her a present along with taking her to dinner.  Do not buy the same thing to give to your Mother or brother.", "Your edit makes it even worse. You don\u2019t plan anything for her and when you do, it isn\u2019t even really about her.

Good luck in the divorce, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be dumbfounded and blame her when she serves you.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  Your gifts aren't gifts to her, they're gifts to several people.   Tbh it is pretty easy to understand why she's upset, and you don't seem to really give a fuck.", "Yeah, yta. You're not getting her a gift, You're including her in gifts you get people.", "YTA-- by making the most of her gifts, you are making them less special to her.\n\nThere's a difference between going to an event with your significant other and going with the whole family.\n\nAnd you say the only times you've ever planned anything for the two of you? You've done this.\n\nAnything else she's planned?\nShe's going to feel like you don't care", "YTA you're more worried about getting a bargain than getting her a gift. Sometimes it's not about getting your money's worth it's about making someone feel special. Each time you buy what essentially becomes a group gift you signal that you aren't really thinking of her.", "Yep. We now crown you asshole", "Wait, how long have you guys been together? Are you saying that you rely on her to do the work of planning every time you go out to an activity? How long has THAT been going on?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nYour baseline is inviting people to events at random, for no special occasion. That is very nice of you.\n\nBut for her special occasions, you are not going above that baseline. So where is the gift?\n\nYou are doing for her special occasions what you'd do for other people on a random day. Meaning, what you're doing for her is not special or celebratory.\n\nIt feels weird because you are clearly very generous, and if feels greedy talking like this about gifts. But the way you're doing things would be pretty upsetting to anyone. Her birthday is equivalent in importance to some random day for the other members of your family.\n\nEdit: your edit made it worse. So you just *randomly* take family and friends out when its not their birthday. But your gf gets nothing from you at all except a birthday gift you gave everyone else for no actual reason. Of course she doesn't feel important or special to you!", "YTA. You're an adult now, you need to improve your emotional intelligence. \n\nIf seeing your girlfriend upset doesn't hurt, knowing that your actions caused it, then you really need to stop and take a long hard look at yourself. \n\nLife isn't all about you. Go to the library, get some books on relationships,  love, and open your understanding of life to take on board empathy.\n\nIf this is too much effort for you, then you're only going to keep hurting current and future partners with your tunnel vision.", "lol YTA... that's so horrible and she's right it totally loses its special character.", "YTA, her birthday is not the time to save money or kill two birds with one stone or whatever the heck this is.", "YTA - Even if you are taking your family on a different night, you are never doing soemnthing that is special just for the two of you.  \n\n\nStart putting the effort in to aking time with her special.", "YTA. She wants the gift you are giving her to be special, not just one out of a bunch you got for several people. I understand where you're coming from logically, but it devalues the gift. \n\nImagine she told you what her favorite wine was, and instead of buying her a bottle, you bought a case and gave her one, and then passed the rest out to friends and family. Do you see how that makes your act of buying it not just about her anymore, how it devalues the bottle that you gave her?", "YTA I'll explain it slowly:\n\nIt feels like your family gets the same amount of love *on any day* that she gets *on her birthday*", "YTA. It\u2019s not a special gift for her if your buying for your whole family, it\u2019s a gift for your whole family and her. Nice of you to buy for everyone but not much of a birthday present for her.", "You get your nieces and nephews you don't know that well all the same crap for christmas because you aren't expected to be super thoughtful when shopping for them.

IMO, what you're doing is not really buying her a gift. It's like you found drinks on sale and wanted to pick up a few for other people so they don't miss out.

Doubt it. \nPlease listen to your GF.", "YTA It's supposed to be a gift for HER yet everyone else is getting a piece of it.

Are you saying you buy things/tickets in bulk and you take her out WITH your family for her birthday, or are you buying in bulk and keeping her and family separate? If it's together, definitely YTA. If it's separate, thats way better but I'd still feel like the gesture is a bit less special. Also, if it's separate, I don't understand why she would feel this strongly about it because it doesn't actually affect her. If she's not present when the family is enjoying the experience, I don't see how it takes away from her birthday. I am curious, however, why you always have to get the same for your family? Is this a guilt thing, are you buying more because you get a better deal? What's up with that?", "NAH\n\nAt first I was going to say she was a bit of an AH because you're clearly still going to these things with her, not bringing extra guests along with the two of you, and spending quality time together, so you're not an AH, and the idea that she should keep others from enjoying things seemed a bit petty. But I don't think that's actually what she's doing . . . \n\nI think it hurts her feelings that what qualifies as a birthday gift for her - something you'd do for her \"for special\" to celebrate her - is the exact same thing that you're also doing for your mum and brother just as a matter of course. So when she gets the tickets, she's supposed to receive them as a special gift . . . but clearly those tickets weren't much of an effort for you if you're buying the same tickets for multiple other members of your family. You're telling her she's supposed to feel valued despite the fact that these gestures are commonplace to you. She's telling you that she'd like to see you make an effort to do something ESPECIALLY AND JUST FOR HER, not just hand her the same tickets you bought for everyone and say, \"But in your case it's for your birthday!\"\n\nThere are NAH, just two people who are seeing the same situation really differently.", "NAH.

As a matter of fact, that is being very frugal and smart. There could be reasons for this as he said he has done this around her birthday. It could be the mom's or brother's birthday as well.

I plan to use 2 tickets for me and her for her birthday and the other 2 for my mum and brother to see it on a different day. \nShe's now saying that the gift I got for her has stopped being quite as special because she wasn't the only one I thought of when I got them. \nShe's then gone on to say I've done this every time I've sorted something for her birthday because the times I've done something, I've used the tickets to take my brother or mum after. We've gone out and done something and because there's still time left, whether it's a convention or something, I've taken someone else. \n I don't understand the problem. I'm getting the most out of my money and the gift but she's really upset about it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just listen to her and do what she ask of you.", "She's right. You don't appear to give her ANY \"just because\" gifts or events, but your mother and brother presumably get holiday and birthday gifts AND these extra gifts for your girlfriend's birthday.
