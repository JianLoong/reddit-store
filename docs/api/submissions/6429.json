{"id": 6429, "submission_id": "102t2m4", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my boyfriend's son a bedroom?", "selftext": "I (28f) have been dating my boyfriend (26m) for about four years. I have a daughter who is 9 and a son who is 7. My boyfriend and I have recently started living together in a three bedroom house with my two kids. Both of the kids have their own rooms as do we but my boyfriend is demanding I make space for his son as well. Ideally he is wanting us to give up our room so all of the kids have their own spaces.\n\nI did not believe this was fair as he does not see his son (6) outside of supervised visits with his sons's mom in public places every couple weeks. In the four years I have been with him I have not even MET his son as his mother requires him to come alone to their visits outside of his family members and occasionally male friends. He has never attempted to gain custody (though he does pay child support) only asked his mother for him to stay or be dropped off which she has never and will never allow. \n\nI did refuse to give up our bedroom but tried to compromise to if he decided to push for custody or she decided to let him stay we could put a second bed or get bunk beds in my sons room until we found a larger house. Although, I did not want to do this immediately as the rooms are small and it wouldn't make sense to take up half his room with an extra bed or spend the money on bunk beds when they weren't going to be put to use right now. I did however say as soon as the circumstances changed I would be happy to make whatever accommodations were needed. \n\nHe got very angry about this and accused me of not caring about his son like he does my kids and playing favorites. I thought this was wrong as I haven't really had the opportunity to establish a relationship with his son but was never against it. It all just doesn't seem realistic for the current situation. Am I being unfair or too harsh about this?\n\n\n**More Info**\n\nJust to be clear the supervised visits were not established through the courts or for any reasons of violence or abuse they are only made by the mom. The only thing that has gone through the courts is child support and that is not the same as a custody hearing were I live. If he did take this to court there is no doubt in my mind he would gain some form of custody although as of right now there is no legal custody agreement. \n\nThis is what she has offered him and he has not pushed to change it though the legal routes. They had not dated long when she became pregnant and she had decided to do it own her own after he was born and he did not push to see him until he was about 6 months old. At this point she had already gotten back into a relationship with one of her previous partners and created a family dynamic that is still present now. She is not interested in him establishing a relationship with his  son more than what it is now. \n\nI try not to get involved in the whole situation as I believe those decisions are on him and its not really my place to try and change things and just support him the best I can. I have obviously taken the precautions needed to make sure all of this information is true for mine and my kids sake and have spoken to her about it once as well. We have lived together previoisly with no issues in apartments this is just our first time in a house with more then two bedrooms. He has NEVER shown any hint of aggression towards me or my kids and has been supportive and a great male figure in their lives.", "created_utc": 1672804180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102t2m4/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_boyfriends_son_a/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either one should make you seriously consider if you want him around your children.", "NTA. But, something bad must have happened for him to only have supervised visitation. Red Flag.", "NTA. \n\nThat is absolutely crazy. Why would you have a room for someone that isn't even living with you guys? I think he is extremely emotional and confused and absolutely does not have the capacity to think outside of his current turmoil (possibly feeling inadequate as a father). I would see this as a red flag to be honest - subjecting your children to this is definitely not in their best interest.", "NTA\n\nWhy would his son need a room in your house if he isn't allowed over?\n\nAlso, major red flag if he's not even allowed to visit his own kid without supervision.

I hope he's actually a safe person for you to be living with. And of course you're NTA for not giving up your bedroom for a child who is literally never there.", "NTA, he\u2019s delusional. You have been more than accomodating.", "NTA why does he need a room in a house he never goes to? He doesn\u2019t even visit, let alone live there. What\u2019s supposed to go in that room? An ikea bed perpetually left in the box?", "NTA for the rooming issues.\n\nWhat is concerning is that you\u2019re with a man who is only allowed supervised visits and has never tried to seek any sort of custody of his child. You\u2019re aware that supervised visitation is ordered when the parent is a danger, right? And that it\u2019s been in place for years?

He\u2019s not even allowed to be alone with his own child but you allow him around yours? \n\nIn the event you stay with him, as women so often do until it\u2019s too late, the boys are almost the same age. Get bunk beds.", "NTA - \n\nYou seem to be being very rational about this...your boyfriend not so much. \n\nThere is no reason nor need for this child to have a bed let alone a whole room in your home as he has NEVER stepped foot in your home, is not allowed to visit, let alone sleep over. \n\nI would be questioning WHY/WHAT HAPPENED to make it where your bf only has supervised visits only with his son. Was there an incident of violence between him and his son or his ex in his history? Courts usually don't require supervised visits unless there is something serious behind that.  I would check that out for your own & children's sake. \n\nI am also concerned that he is so angry about you not accommodating his child RIGHT NOW - when there is no need to at this time and you've already expressed your willingness to accommodate the child when the time comes.   \n\nPlease consider these warning flags and consider if there are any other things that maybe you might want to think twice about in this relationship.  Take care.", "NTA. How dare he accuse you of not caring about his son while he's the one who's never pushed for custody. Has he even tried to get you to meet this child? It sounds like your dealing with more of a deadbeat then a daddy to me.\n\nIt's not realistic to have a room for a child who never stays overnight. It's just not. Revisit this if he's actually trying to change that.", "He is irrational. He is living in a fairy tale where his ex will magically give him custody and you will give up your room. Where all the women in his life bow to his whims, as it was meant to be. You seem all logic and sense. I don\u2019t think logic will work on him.

And why are his visitations supervised? So many questions.", "NTA", "NTA What he wants is not real. Giving his son a room in a house that he never visits is a symbol of hope, of having a complete family. He doesn't see logic or reality because he wants it so much. So please have compassion when you talk about it and maybe imagine a bubble around you that his hurtful words cannot get through. They just bounce off without their emotion getting inside your heart. There is no reason to do what he wants but he isn't being reasonable. He can't. It hurts too much. Much love to you as you help him deal with this loneliness and broken dream.", "If his son did visit, then it would be entirely appropriate for him to have a space (say a bunk bed) that was his regular space when visiting. \n\nAs he\u2019s not allowed to visit at present, just assure your BF that you\u2019ll buy the bunk beds as soon as he is allowed.  (And, of course, if he is allowed to visit, then of course you should get the bunk beds.)", "NTA. \n\nSounds like there\u2019s no court ordered visitation from your post. Child support only needs paternity proven and is separate from custody is most places. So I\u2019m not surprised by that. However, he\u2019s showing guilty behavior with his desire to have an empty bedroom. Many parents who do this type of thing, while never seeking out actual custody, are usually struggling with some sort of parental guilt or inadequacy. The room is almost like a physical reminder or self punishment for these things. \n\nI think your boyfriend may have some serious feelings about his role as his son\u2019s father and what worth he has in that role and should probably talk to you or a therapist. Not having a room for a child who will never set foot in your home is logical and makes the most sense. He doesn\u2019t even visit the home let alone sleep there.", "NTA. You have defined some very reasonable conditions for creating a space in your shared home. If you had already met his son (or were allowed to meet his son), and your children had met his son, and if his son was a greater physical presence in his life, then it would make sense to create a specific space for him in the house. As you have said, the son has one established a relationship with his father.  Not worth creating/carving out a space.", "NTA. You're being perfectly reasonable. Why give a bedroom to a kid that he can never have sleep over because of the supervised visits? That doesn't make ANY sense to me.", "NTA, and you should really look into trading up.  Just sayin", "YTA for simply being with that man.  Having him around your children.  Saying you are playing favorites?  Uh, yeah sorry but you *do* favor your children over his considering you barely know his kid.   Not making someone give up their room for a kid who has never spent a minute in your house and probably won't anytime in the near future seems pretty normal.\n\nSo many red flags here and yet you move this guy in with *your* children?  Jesus some people shouldn't be parents.", "Are you another account of the OP. \nWell, that's been deleted now. Weird. \n\nHow do you know why he has supervised visits ?  He could be lying. \n\nEither the court ordered this or he is lazy and never stood up to his ex. He parents his kid from a park or parking lot ?  What do they do together ?\n\nI would never be in a relationship with someone who didn't care about spending quality time with their kids.", "NTA you haven't even met the kid why does he need a room?", "YTA to allow a man who is only allowed supervised visits with his own child around your vulnerable children.", "NTA. Bunk beds or a Murphy bed would do. His approach to a solution is way too aggressive.\n\nHowever - one thing I've never thought sensible - parents have the entire house AND the biggest room, usually an en suite. Kids have small rooms, leaving their toys and play areas all over the house. Parents, who spend less time in the bedroom and rarely use it for much, get the big room - which is unused 2/3rds of the day. Kids play in their rooms all. the. time. \n\nGive the big room to the two boys. Have a blast decorating it. Give the next largest room to the girl. Decorate! Why waste prime toy storage and play space when all parents really do is sleep in a bedroom? Okay, sure, but still! \n\nI've always thought the allocation of space was foolishly hierarchial. It takes realignment of priorities, but the  change could improve the house flow.", "YTA.
