{"id": 6429, "submission_id": "102t2m4", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my boyfriend's son a bedroom?", "selftext": "I (28f) have been dating my boyfriend (26m) for about four years. I have a daughter who is 9 and a son who is 7. My boyfriend and I have recently started living together in a three bedroom house with my two kids. Both of the kids have their own rooms as do we but my boyfriend is demanding I make space for his son as well. Ideally he is wanting us to give up our room so all of the kids have their own spaces.\n\nI did not believe this was fair as he does not see his son (6) outside of supervised visits with his sons's mom in public places every couple weeks. In the four years I have been with him I have not even MET his son as his mother requires him to come alone to their visits outside of his family members and occasionally male friends. He has never attempted to gain custody (though he does pay child support) only asked his mother for him to stay or be dropped off which she has never and will never allow. \n\nI did refuse to give up our bedroom but tried to compromise to if he decided to push for custody or she decided to let him stay we could put a second bed or get bunk beds in my sons room until we found a larger house. Although, I did not want to do this immediately as the rooms are small and it wouldn't make sense to take up half his room with an extra bed or spend the money on bunk beds when they weren't going to be put to use right now. I did however say as soon as the circumstances changed I would be happy to make whatever accommodations were needed. \n\nHe got very angry about this and accused me of not caring about his son like he does my kids and playing favorites. I thought this was wrong as I haven't really had the opportunity to establish a relationship with his son but was never against it. It all just doesn't seem realistic for the current situation. Am I being unfair or too harsh about this?\n\n\n**More Info**\n\nJust to be clear the supervised visits were not established through the courts or for any reasons of violence or abuse they are only made by the mom. The only thing that has gone through the courts is child support and that is not the same as a custody hearing were I live. If he did take this to court there is no doubt in my mind he would gain some form of custody although as of right now there is no legal custody agreement. \n\nThis is what she has offered him and he has not pushed to change it though the legal routes. They had not dated long when she became pregnant and she had decided to do it own her own after he was born and he did not push to see him until he was about 6 months old. At this point she had already gotten back into a relationship with one of her previous partners and created a family dynamic that is still present now. She is not interested in him establishing a relationship with his  son more than what it is now. \n\nI try not to get involved in the whole situation as I believe those decisions are on him and its not really my place to try and change things and just support him the best I can. I have obviously taken the precautions needed to make sure all of this information is true for mine and my kids sake and have spoken to her about it once as well. We have lived together previoisly with no issues in apartments this is just our first time in a house with more then two bedrooms. He has NEVER shown any hint of aggression towards me or my kids and has been supportive and a great male figure in their lives.", "created_utc": 1672804180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102t2m4/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_boyfriends_son_a/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was there an incident of violence between him and his son or his ex in his history? Courts usually don't require supervised visits unless there is something serious behind that.

However, he\u2019s showing guilty behavior with his desire to have an empty bedroom. Many parents who do this type of thing, while never seeking out actual custody, are usually struggling with some sort of parental guilt or inadequacy. The room is almost like a physical reminder or self punishment for these things. \n\nI think your boyfriend may have some serious feelings about his role as his son\u2019s father and what worth he has in that role and should probably talk to you or a therapist. Not having a room for a child who will never set foot in your home is logical and makes the most sense. He doesn\u2019t even visit the home let alone sleep there.", "NTA.

Bunk beds or a Murphy bed would do. His approach to a solution is way too aggressive.\n\nHowever - one thing I've never thought sensible - parents have the entire house AND the biggest room, usually an en suite. Kids have small rooms, leaving their toys and play areas all over the house. Parents, who spend less time in the bedroom and rarely use it for much, get the big room - which is unused 2/3rds of the day. Kids play in their rooms all. the. time. \n\nGive the big room to the two boys. Have a blast decorating it. Give the next largest room to the girl. Decorate! Why waste prime toy storage and play space when all parents really do is sleep in a bedroom? Okay, sure, but still! \n\nI've always thought the allocation of space was foolishly hierarchial.

The current visition situation  is not court mandated according to OP.", "So you were just shouting into the abyss?\n\nBecause that comment wasn\u2019t condoning drinking and driving or suggesting that person was \u2018smart\u2019. Quite the opposite actually. I can\u2019t tell if you know that.\n\n\u2018if the other ways are just as bad, then op really needs to learn the reason\u2019", "OP said it was agreed upon outside of courts, mom\u2019s decision. Mom also doesn\u2019t want OP to meet the kid, and doesn\u2019t want ex to be in the kids life because she is with a partner and \u201cnew family.\u201d Not enough info for something negative to be inferred, it could be a matter of money and control.", "[removed]", "They must be though. Otherwise how would the court know how much CS to award?", "Is this simple enough for you\n\nIf you get behind the wheel and drive after drinking even 1 alcoholic drink, you're a moron plain and simple", "Why is he even allowing his ex to limit him to supervised visitation?? Something is really wrong there.", "Yea doesn't mean the mum didn't say supervised visits or nothing and we usually say those things with good reason", "Mmmmmhmmmm", "Yes, but what led you to make that statement?\n\nNobody said anything to the contrary\u2026\n\nYou are the one that\u2019s confused Simple Jack.", "Yeah, not sure why he isn\u2019t fighting for more, but relented easily to the child support.", "Did he have a DNA test run?", "NTA, you have a three bedroom house with all bedrooms occupied. You can't be expected to reserve a room for a kid that will basically never use it.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you even with this guy?", "NTA. He is getting way too many steps ahead.", "Yeah that was a red flag for me! Also the edit, trying to say it isn\u2019t really supervised visitation. I hope her children are safe but it doesn\u2019t sound like it is.", "The boy hasn't met the guy or the kids and has only supervised visit. There is absolutely zero reason for him to have space in that house right now. If custody changes she has already proposed a solution. \n\nAnd LOL at giving kids the master bedroom. I'd be damned to be sleeping in my kid's bedroom and have her in my master bedroom. I'm the one working and paying for the house. I'd like my kid to not have expectations of being entitled to an enormous bedroom/bathroom as a child. I've put in my time living in small spaces. I'd like my kid to stay humble. Once she makes her own money she can so as she pleases.", "I'm not 100% sure, but I dont think so. I think it was just mutal agreement on paternity.", "That's not the question", "That doesn't add up at all. Custody must be established because a parent doesn't pay child support if they have custody. I guess they wouldn't have to do the visitation arrangement at the same time, but like, why wouldn't you? It's kinda fishy.", "That's not true at all. At a child support hearing the judge makes the determination based on who primarly has the child if there is no custody agreement. And a custody arrangement is litterally a whole separate hearing that you can't just do at the same time. Hes been paying it since he was born, as I explained in my edit, she primarily had him then."]}
