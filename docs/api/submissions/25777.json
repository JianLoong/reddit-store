Sunday, my nephew (12yrs) fell off the trampoline and hurt his leg. \n\nWe were all checking out of the rental that day and a number of us was going back to my parents house - my partner,  I and my sister (44 yrs - not nephew\u2019s mother, this is a different sister). Now our nephew was added to the list as his mother not taking personal carer\u2019s leave.\n\nAs we were about to check out, my mother comes over and tells me that my sister (not the nephews mother) and she had decided that my partner and I will stay in a room with my nephew. I told her that we will just go to my in-laws\u2019s house as they have an empty room and it was no big deal because they only live 10 minutes away. I had very been sick with influenza prior for 2 week since we arrived home and didn\u2019t feel like staying with a teenager in the room. She declines the offer.\n\nA few hours later, we are sitting in the couch in my parents living room and my sister angrily comes to tell me that me and my partner WILL stay in the same room with nephew and how selfish am I to say otherwise. I tell her no and offer that we go to my in-laws house. She starts screaming that if HER MOTHER has to stress about this and if an accident happens when HER MOTHER has to drive her into the airport in the middle of the night then it is MY FAULT for being so selfish. (Our mother has to drive my 44 yrs sister to the airport at 2 AM.)\n\nI got upset and told her that it is weird that they just decides sleeping arrangements without me and that in all the years I was growing up, I always had to sleep on couches or in my parents rooms because her and her kids got my room. Why couldn\u2019t she be flexible for this one time? \nThe argument ended with her saying a lot of insulting things and me just repeating that we are fine staying with in-laws. Finally, he stays in her room.\n\nMy sister is a successful marketing executive so I don\u2019t understand why she did not book a hotel room near the airport, caught the train or asked the company to arrange transportation if she was worried about our mother driving in the middle of the night. I wished that I had dared to say that but it is the first time I stood up to my sister.\n\nMy partner and I agreed that if they included us in the conversation, we would agreed to share room but because they never showed any respect it was the right thing to say no. \n\nObviously, this is recurring theme. Sisters with kids decides and tell us without kids how things are. I think it was different when my sisters had small children and I was a teenager but the kids are teenagers now and I am 30 with my own partner.

Your family has never made your comfort a priority and has always forced you to take the couch or something similar in favor of your sister and others.\n\nRemove sleeping arrangements from the equation all together by staying at your inlaws or a hotel and only coming to visit your family during the day", ">she had decided that my partner and I will stay in a room with my nephew.

She declines the offer.\n\nShe declines your offer to stay elsewhere? That's not a thing she can decline. Your In-Laws could decline I suppose, but it sounds like they treat you better than your family does. Time to make staying with them the new normal.", "Nta. I'm thinking Sis never booked her own space or way because she's never had to, Mom was happy to put you out. My only hope is that Nephew didn't and hasn't heard how his mom seems to treat him like baggage, shunted off to others", "Doesn't really matter how old the nephew is - it's a bizarre arrangement.\n\nThis really does sound like a dominance thing.

The arrangements should be a discussion among adults not a dictatorial decision. You had options. She can't force this on two other adults. NTA.", "NTA.  And she can\u2019t \u201cdecline\u201d something you\u2019ve decided.  What a piece of work. Next time, just stay at your in laws and visit during the day.  Why put yourselves in that position again.  Sheesh. I\u2019m proud of you for sticking to your boundaries.", "NTA and I am very proud of you for standing up for yourself", " I must be missing something, because with a full house situation, wouldn't any reasonable person think it would be better for everyone if you stayed with your in-laws? Why would she want the kid to sleep in your room???", "NTA, it makes the least sense to put a teen boy in a room with either of his aunts, that is really awkward, no one would be able to sleep. It would also be weird to put your husband there, bc he presumably knows the kid least. The kid should be sharing with someone he's comfortable with, especially if he's ill.\n\nIt would probably make the most sense to put grandson in a cot in his grandparents' room tbh.\n\nBut actually, the best solution was the one you offered - to go to your in-laws to create more space! I don't really understand why that was not acceptable to anyone.", "NTA. Plan to stay with your inlaws for future visits", "You are NTA.  Your mother & your sister are.  Your sister is a huge AH.  What gives her the right to demand that he stay with you?  She's not the boss of you or anyone else & doesn't get to force him on you.  You did the right thing standing up to her.  And didn't it feel good?  Keep standing up to her.  Don't let her be your bully.", "Sounds more like the mother declined the offer of them leaving to leave the room to the nephew, and told them that she'd rather have them stay in that room alone and put the nephew in another room (her own apparently from what the sister was complaining about later).\n\nAbsolutely NTA, by the way. Frankly after the sister came in screaming and ordering them to take the nephew they should have picked up their bags and gone to the in-laws. And leave the mother to deal with the crazy harridan."]}
