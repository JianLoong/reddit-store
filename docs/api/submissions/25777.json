Sunday, my nephew (12yrs) fell off the trampoline and hurt his leg. \n\nWe were all checking out of the rental that day and a number of us was going back to my parents house - my partner,  I and my sister (44 yrs - not nephew\u2019s mother, this is a different sister). Now our nephew was added to the list as his mother not taking personal carer\u2019s leave.\n\nAs we were about to check out, my mother comes over and tells me that my sister (not the nephews mother) and she had decided that my partner and I will stay in a room with my nephew. I told her that we will just go to my in-laws\u2019s house as they have an empty room and it was no big deal because they only live 10 minutes away. I had very been sick with influenza prior for 2 week since we arrived home and didn\u2019t feel like staying with a teenager in the room. She declines the offer.\n\nA few hours later, we are sitting in the couch in my parents living room and my sister angrily comes to tell me that me and my partner WILL stay in the same room with nephew and how selfish am I to say otherwise. I tell her no and offer that we go to my in-laws house. She starts screaming that if HER MOTHER has to stress about this and if an accident happens when HER MOTHER has to drive her into the airport in the middle of the night then it is MY FAULT for being so selfish. (Our mother has to drive my 44 yrs sister to the airport at 2 AM.)\n\nI got upset and told her that it is weird that they just decides sleeping arrangements without me and that in all the years I was growing up, I always had to sleep on couches or in my parents rooms because her and her kids got my room. Why couldn\u2019t she be flexible for this one time? \nThe argument ended with her saying a lot of insulting things and me just repeating that we are fine staying with in-laws. Finally, he stays in her room.\n\nMy sister is a successful marketing executive so I don\u2019t understand why she did not book a hotel room near the airport, caught the train or asked the company to arrange transportation if she was worried about our mother driving in the middle of the night. I wished that I had dared to say that but it is the first time I stood up to my sister.\n\nMy partner and I agreed that if they included us in the conversation, we would agreed to share room but because they never showed any respect it was the right thing to say no. \n\nObviously, this is recurring theme. Sisters with kids decides and tell us without kids how things are. I think it was different when my sisters had small children and I was a teenager but the kids are teenagers now and I am 30 with my own partner.

You offered to stay somewhere else and your sister has the means to cover other sleeping arrangements.
