{"id": 30853, "submission_id": "17ttfiz", "title": "AITA for wanting to invite friends to my daughter\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "My (F68) daughter is getting married to her partner of 8 years in September \u201824. We have been arguing over this and she told me to post this here for opinions.\n\nFor context, I am paying for the whole wedding. She is pretty introverted and doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends she wants to invite. Her husband to be on the other hand is very extroverted and has a lot of people he would invite given the chance. I thought it would be fair then that the brides side gets 30 invites and the grooms side gets 30 invites as we are on a budget. Since my daughter doesn\u2019t have a lot of people, and there are spots on her side left over (after family and her friends) I have people I want to invite. Between my husband and I, we have 13 people to invite. To be honest, there was no leaving them out one way or the other as we have social obligations to invite them anyway. I feel as though since we are paying for this and are hosting it, we should get a say in who comes regardless.\n\nMy daughter has said that this is not how it normally works and that her and her fianc\u00e9e should have first priority in who comes and the spots should be dedicated to her fianc\u00e9es friends before mine if there are limited seats. She also said that \u201cthis is their wedding and not my \u2018class of 74 reunion.\u2019\u201d But him and his family are not financially contributing to this at all. It will reflect poorly on me if I don\u2019t invite my and my husband\u2019s people. She\u2019s refusing to see my side and says that her fianc\u00e9e being limited in his guests and his parents only being allowed to invite 2 people because they aren\u2019t in a place to contribute is unfair.\n\nIf I am not allowed to throw this up to my standard, I do not want my name on it. They can do what they want, but I have half a mind to pull my money from the equation if they insist on not allowing who I want to be there. I told them they will have full control over everything else! It will still be their day! I just want my friends there to support the big day! Is that really so wrong? Am I really the a hole? I am starting to think I have a bridezilla and groomzilla on my hands.\n\nAfter seeing replies I would like to add some information:\n\nWe are white and live in the US so not of Asian culture.\n\nWe have a lot of family so the breakdown of my daughter\u2019s side is 14 family members, 3 of her friends, and 13 of mine.\n\nShe says she doesn\u2019t have a problem with me inviting my friends. She has a problem being limited in her and her fianc\u00e9es friends.\n\nMy social obligations to my friends are because I have known some of these people for 50 plus years and I do not want to ruin friendships that strong. I was invited to their children\u2019s weddings so why would they not be invited to my child\u2019s wedding? My son opted to not have one so this will be my only opportunity.", "created_utc": 1699822333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ttfiz/aita_for_wanting_to_invite_friends_to_my/", "score": 628, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like that's what the Bride and Groom would prefer anyway.I understand that you are excited but your Daughters wedding isn't the time to get your peacock feathers out.\n\nWhile it's lovely of you to pay, it's frustrating to see a gift with conditions of control.  \n\n\nEdit to add: if the people you wanted to invite have had a loving history with your Daughter, then I can understand you wanting them to attend, but it doesn't sound as such given her hesitation.", "> She also said that \u201cthis is their wedding and not my \u2018class of 74 reunion.\u2019\u201d \n\nNicely said.\n\n> But him and his family are not financially contributing to this at all\n\nDoes not matter.

I'm a mom, so I get it, these issues are complicated. And you clearly think, it's your money so it should be your say. A few questions for you to ponder however: Are these people you're inviting close to and loved by your daughter? Have they supported her, loved her, like surrogate aunties and uncles? If you didn't have money to contribute would you still expect this amount of people?\n\nTo me, you saying *\"If I am not allowed to throw this up to my standard, I do not want my name on it\"* sounds like a baby throwing it's toys out of the crib, not like a grown woman. *\"If I don't get to do it my way, I won't do it at all!!!!\"* \n\nIn reality, I think you should offer to contribute to the wedding and offer the grooms parents the same amount of invites that you get.

Your daughter\u2019s small wedding is not the time to throw your weight around.

Whether she includes you after the fuss you\u2019ve kicked up about inviting randos to her wedding is another story. \n\nDo you want her and your future son-in-law to have a wonderful day or do you want to be right?

Either you paying for the wedding is a gift, or it's just a way for you to meet what you perceive as a \"social obligation,\" which is a BS justification anyway.

Fine, don't pay. But the day isn't about you. Why would your friends even want to go and why would you even want them there?

Your daughter is 100% right. Social obligations? What century are you living in? The wedding guests should be friends of the couple, not their parents.

If your friends are going to snub you over that then they\u2019re not real friends and you should let them do as they will. Having her fianc\u00e9\u2019s loved friends there to celebrate with them will make her and her new husband happy and they will have photos that they can look back on in 50 years time with friends they still know or stories to tell about those people rather than just a list of funeral dates to attach to people they never really cared about.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re willing to withdraw your money from the event over this shows exactly where your priorities are - you think this is an excuse for you to show off rather than a celebration of your child\u2019s loving partnership and a chance to welcome your new son into your family.\n\nIf you decide not to pay, that\u2019s a decent way to get yourself uninvited from the wedding they eventually save up for, as well as which you\u2019ll probably delay the arrival of any grandchildren since they won\u2019t be able to afford them for longer. Even if your daughter and her partner can afford this without you, what you\u2019re showing them here is that you are going to interfere in aspects of their life that are not yours to control, and that you\u2019ll do it for reasons of social convention rather than love.\n\nIf your daughter liked those people she\u2019d invite them herself.

Usually at that size wedding it's close family, maybe godparents, and then the closest friends of bride and groom.\n\nAs others pointed out, this is the bride and groom's day. However one thing that I think should give you pause, and also should give your daughter pause, is that the groom is willing to ask that most of the guests be from his side, for a wedding for which he is paying nothing. This is a self-interested approach: traditional practices where he benefits (bride's family pays) and modern practices where he benefits (guests of bride's family get cut out because modern rules say bride's parents get little or no say in guests). Marrying a selfish man is more of the big concern here than whether your entire bridge club can come to the wedding, if you see what I mean. \n\nI think it's also problematic that your daughter is not standing up for her mom. When two people get married, they should definitely become each other's top priority, and that's likely what she's doing here, and it's fine. But it could alternately mean that their relationship is one where he does what he wants and she designs all her \"interests\" and \"desires\" around what he wants, and there appears to be no conflict, but it's only because she's allowing herself to disappear into his shadow, with his encouragement. \n\nOne thing I just noticed.

It never occurred to me to say my mum couldn\u2019t invite her friends, I knew most of them and was happy for them to attend but there were a couple if her friends I didn\u2019t even know.\n\nNot entirely sure why, probably has roots in the parents legally handing over ownership of their daughter to the husband; marriage wasn\u2019t so much about the people who were actually getting married.\n\nMight be that OP grew up with that culture, especially if she\u2019s been married for 40 years or so.", "Sounds like the mother is paying for the wedding for her own benefit and control rather than to make this a special day for her daughter. \n\nI would much rather my wedding be attended by my partner's friends than my mother's friends.", "If OP's friendships will be ruined because they're not invited to their daughter's rather small wedding, I question the validity of those friendships.

The entire problem stems from OP not being willing/able to pay for additional guests. If OP wants to limit it to 60 people, that's fine.

If OP wants her 13 friends to come, they should pay for 73 people instead of 60.\n\nPaying for the wedding is generous, but OP seems to think that it's all about her and is more concerned about appearances than making her daughter happy. It also seems like she looks down on future SIL's parents for not contributing to the costs.\n\nOP is obviously free to not pay for the wedding.

We reluctantly allowed her to have 12 invites more for our own sake to stop the complaining. But it is worth noting that there were 270 guests in total so 1) both me and my husband had been able to invite at least most of the important people in our lives and 2) I didn\u2019t even see the people she\u2019d invited lol. \n\nInviting 13 friends to a wedding of 60 people is a totally different story. If the daughter thought these people were important to her she would have invited them herself (I know i did so for a lot of my mothers friends who are like extended family to me). So these people ARENT invited and it seems aren\u2019t even welcome as daughter is resisting. Additionally, these 13 guests will be impossible to avoid. Their presence will be a constant reminder of the frustrations and absence of important people on the grooms side. Seeing these 13 people will make the bride and groom miserable.

Wanting them there because they are close to you and not the couple is even more ridiculous. How do you even plan on paying attention to your daughter and the wedding when you have a whole entourage of your own to entertain?

It's something I'd expect to see in \"The Wedding Singer\" movie (set in 1985) rather than at a real, modern wedding.", "Reading threads like this confirms over and over how happy I am to have eloped. I don't *think* my family would have caused dramas, but then again these threads always blow my mind, so who knows??", "That's okay, her daughter will have eloped already.", "Yup, absolutely, but I wasn\u2019t excusing it, just adding context as to why some parents might feel obliged to invite their friends to their children\u2019s weddings, most likely because they attended their friends children\u2019s weddings (that is a mouthful).", "I\u2019m not fond of Susan.  She gives me the willies.", "Fucking Susan. It\u2019s always something with her!", "I know you're being sarcastic, but that's the vibe I got.\nETA: misspelled words", "This happened to my best friend from college. There were like 2 friends of us from college, and the rest were family (close family of bride and groom and really extended family of both). Like my friend's parents are divorced so she had 2 sets of parents to invite, and then her stepmother and stepfather wanted to invite their brothers and sisters and a cousin and uncle and a doctor here, a proctologist there. It was like 250 guests and only like 5 friends of her total.", "Holy shit. My bottomless sympathies.", "Is it his mom? \ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s about 1/4 of the guest list which is insane", "When I was planning my wedding, I told my mom she could invite 30 people. She sent me a list of 85 and got mad when I told her she didn't get that many. What is with the older generation and thinking everything is about them?", "He's organising a PR event, she's trying to marry the love of her life.", "I had a wedding the size of OP\u2019s daughter, I couldn\u2019t imagine inviting that many people simply because they were moms friends. I and/or my husband knew and loved every single person at my wedding and none of my moms or MIL friends that we weren\u2019t close with.", "This a handful of close family friends is normal but almost half her side in friends of parents is silly.", "Its easy to see why her son opted to not have a wedding lol.", "If the bride doesn\u2019t invite them, they don\u2019t come.  Full stop.", "Are people even that desperate to attend the wedding of a couple they're not friends with? I can't imagine being upset that my friend's adult daughter didn't kick their spouse's friends to the curb to invite me to the wedding instead. YTA", "Yup! If friends of 50 years would abandon you for this they're not real friends", "Not necessarily. Some friendships are strong enough to feel like family. So not getting an invitation to something so important would seem to warrant either a conversation about why they aren\u2019t being invited or risk making the person who didn\u2019t get invited feel some type of way. I know for myself I have a couple friends where I would need some context if I were getting cut out of an event that is such a big deal.", "They're just like OP, vapid and image obsessed. Their children are probably also NC with them.", "Imagine prioritizing your high school friendships over the relationship you have with your daughter", "or Hyacinth Bucket, depending on which side of the big blue.", "Right??? I mean I think op over exaggerated how her friends will feel. But if they are willing to end a friendship because they weren\u2019t invited to a wedding thats ridiculous and maybe they aren\u2019t as close as op claims to be. A true friend would completely understand.", "Sounds like OP is inviting the country club or something. Gross.", "Oh yes! Or even better I'd love to be staff at this wedding e.g. waiter or DJ. ( Playing just songs the couple gave their Okay for. >;) )", "My goodness, though, remember her daughter's wedding? The catering was just *off*, wasn't it? And the bridesmaids' dresses made them all look slutty, I thought Susan had better taste to be honest.", "I thought nobody could go lower than Patricia, but I suppose nothing should surprise me any more!", "Excuse YOU, \"Mummy\" \n\n\n(Yeah for real, the bloody south of England is full of absolute melts)", "Boomers (my parents) were named the \u201cme generation\u201d by the 1970s, long before their ungrateful kids & grandkids were born.  IME they never do a favor without strings attached &or holding it over your head for eternity.  \n\nImho someone saying, \u201cWell, since I\u2019m paying, I should get to\u2026\u201d should be a giant red flag, especially to the person saying it.  Otherwise the resentments pile up.\n\n*Not all boomers bad.  Sorry, I forgot the obligatory disclaimer that I usually put before ANY criticism of the *cohort* known for being notoriously thin skinned.", "We were throwing a baby shower that my MIL was helping plan. I had to explicitly tell them (then have a knock down drag out brawl basically) that they could not invite their friends that we had told them multiple times that we dislike. Apparently they had already invited them and \"they care about you all so much\" well tough shit I won't be there if they are. Yeah they got un invited by MIL.", "She. OP is mom.", "\"She\"", "Yeah that is 100% where OP lost me. No mention of these being practically family. Just this \u201csocial obligation\u201d \n\nEw\n\nI hope your daughter decides to elope in Vegas without you", "So much this. Most of the time, the only reason people go to their friend's children's wedding is out of obligation. There are people that I have been friends with for more than 35 years and it wouldn't occur to me to invite them to my son's wedding. And, I know darn well that they would remain my friends.", "Hyper social retirees might.  My Dad\u2019s social calendar in his last decade stayed full, so full he had little time for family unless we\u2019d come to their senior events.  The entire thing reminds me of him & his crew.  He was never so social until then lol.", "Ok, sure. The context is that there's not enough space. Both the bride and the groom get to choose half the guests each. If OP's daughter was more of an extrovert, she'd fill up her half with her own friends. Since she doesn't have enough, she's choosing to invite more of her fianc\u00e9's friends.", "I feel really bad for her daughter. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s putting up a bit of a fight for this! But I\u2019m getting the sense that OP will just ignore all the comments calling her the AH and will push and push until she gets her own way. Won\u2019t be long till her daughter is NC as well.", "I\u2019d make a special boujee gift registry just for grandmas guests and send that to her. If they all have proof of purchase over $500 then they can come", "Omg just wait til I tell you about Marion", "Love the phrase Absolute Melt", "You're not wrong.  There were several movements and theories that gained a lot of traction in the formative years of that generation that emphasized selfishness in response to a centralist society to a degree that ended up glorifying narcissism in the name of personal independence for a lot of people.", "With an Elvis impersonator officiating!", "Is her daughter an introvert or is it just anxiety from an overbearing mother?", "*Book group* Marion? I never trusted her! Alison was having.... problems with her, I heard!"]}
