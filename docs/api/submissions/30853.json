{"id": 30853, "submission_id": "17ttfiz", "title": "AITA for wanting to invite friends to my daughter\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "My (F68) daughter is getting married to her partner of 8 years in September \u201824. We have been arguing over this and she told me to post this here for opinions.\n\nFor context, I am paying for the whole wedding. She is pretty introverted and doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends she wants to invite. Her husband to be on the other hand is very extroverted and has a lot of people he would invite given the chance. I thought it would be fair then that the brides side gets 30 invites and the grooms side gets 30 invites as we are on a budget. Since my daughter doesn\u2019t have a lot of people, and there are spots on her side left over (after family and her friends) I have people I want to invite. Between my husband and I, we have 13 people to invite. To be honest, there was no leaving them out one way or the other as we have social obligations to invite them anyway. I feel as though since we are paying for this and are hosting it, we should get a say in who comes regardless.\n\nMy daughter has said that this is not how it normally works and that her and her fianc\u00e9e should have first priority in who comes and the spots should be dedicated to her fianc\u00e9es friends before mine if there are limited seats. She also said that \u201cthis is their wedding and not my \u2018class of 74 reunion.\u2019\u201d But him and his family are not financially contributing to this at all. It will reflect poorly on me if I don\u2019t invite my and my husband\u2019s people. She\u2019s refusing to see my side and says that her fianc\u00e9e being limited in his guests and his parents only being allowed to invite 2 people because they aren\u2019t in a place to contribute is unfair.\n\nIf I am not allowed to throw this up to my standard, I do not want my name on it. They can do what they want, but I have half a mind to pull my money from the equation if they insist on not allowing who I want to be there. I told them they will have full control over everything else! It will still be their day! I just want my friends there to support the big day! Is that really so wrong? Am I really the a hole? I am starting to think I have a bridezilla and groomzilla on my hands.\n\nAfter seeing replies I would like to add some information:\n\nWe are white and live in the US so not of Asian culture.\n\nWe have a lot of family so the breakdown of my daughter\u2019s side is 14 family members, 3 of her friends, and 13 of mine.\n\nShe says she doesn\u2019t have a problem with me inviting my friends. She has a problem being limited in her and her fianc\u00e9es friends.\n\nMy social obligations to my friends are because I have known some of these people for 50 plus years and I do not want to ruin friendships that strong. I was invited to their children\u2019s weddings so why would they not be invited to my child\u2019s wedding? My son opted to not have one so this will be my only opportunity.", "created_utc": 1699822333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ttfiz/aita_for_wanting_to_invite_friends_to_my/", "score": 2249, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like that's what the Bride and Groom would prefer anyway.I understand that you are excited but your Daughters wedding isn't the time to get your peacock feathers out.\n\nWhile it's lovely of you to pay, it's frustrating to see a gift with conditions of control.  \n\n\nEdit to add: if the people you wanted to invite have had a loving history with your Daughter, then I can understand you wanting them to attend, but it doesn't sound as such given her hesitation.", "> She also said that \u201cthis is their wedding and not my \u2018class of 74 reunion.\u2019\u201d \n\nNicely said.\n\n> But him and his family are not financially contributing to this at all\n\nDoes not matter.

I'm a mom, so I get it, these issues are complicated. And you clearly think, it's your money so it should be your say. A few questions for you to ponder however: Are these people you're inviting close to and loved by your daughter? Have they supported her, loved her, like surrogate aunties and uncles? If you didn't have money to contribute would you still expect this amount of people?\n\nTo me, you saying *\"If I am not allowed to throw this up to my standard, I do not want my name on it\"* sounds like a baby throwing it's toys out of the crib, not like a grown woman. *\"If I don't get to do it my way, I won't do it at all!!!!\"* \n\nIn reality, I think you should offer to contribute to the wedding and offer the grooms parents the same amount of invites that you get.

Whether she includes you after the fuss you\u2019ve kicked up about inviting randos to her wedding is another story. \n\nDo you want her and your future son-in-law to have a wonderful day or do you want to be right?

Either you paying for the wedding is a gift, or it's just a way for you to meet what you perceive as a \"social obligation,\" which is a BS justification anyway.

Fine, don't pay. But the day isn't about you. Why would your friends even want to go and why would you even want them there?

Your daughter is 100% right. Social obligations? What century are you living in? The wedding guests should be friends of the couple, not their parents.

If your friends are going to snub you over that then they\u2019re not real friends and you should let them do as they will. Having her fianc\u00e9\u2019s loved friends there to celebrate with them will make her and her new husband happy and they will have photos that they can look back on in 50 years time with friends they still know or stories to tell about those people rather than just a list of funeral dates to attach to people they never really cared about.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re willing to withdraw your money from the event over this shows exactly where your priorities are - you think this is an excuse for you to show off rather than a celebration of your child\u2019s loving partnership and a chance to welcome your new son into your family.\n\nIf you decide not to pay, that\u2019s a decent way to get yourself uninvited from the wedding they eventually save up for, as well as which you\u2019ll probably delay the arrival of any grandchildren since they won\u2019t be able to afford them for longer. Even if your daughter and her partner can afford this without you, what you\u2019re showing them here is that you are going to interfere in aspects of their life that are not yours to control, and that you\u2019ll do it for reasons of social convention rather than love.\n\nIf your daughter liked those people she\u2019d invite them herself.

Usually at that size wedding it's close family, maybe godparents, and then the closest friends of bride and groom.\n\nAs others pointed out, this is the bride and groom's day. However one thing that I think should give you pause, and also should give your daughter pause, is that the groom is willing to ask that most of the guests be from his side, for a wedding for which he is paying nothing. This is a self-interested approach: traditional practices where he benefits (bride's family pays) and modern practices where he benefits (guests of bride's family get cut out because modern rules say bride's parents get little or no say in guests). Marrying a selfish man is more of the big concern here than whether your entire bridge club can come to the wedding, if you see what I mean. \n\nI think it's also problematic that your daughter is not standing up for her mom. When two people get married, they should definitely become each other's top priority, and that's likely what she's doing here, and it's fine. But it could alternately mean that their relationship is one where he does what he wants and she designs all her \"interests\" and \"desires\" around what he wants, and there appears to be no conflict, but it's only because she's allowing herself to disappear into his shadow, with his encouragement. \n\nOne thing I just noticed.

The entire problem stems from OP not being willing/able to pay for additional guests. If OP wants to limit it to 60 people, that's fine.

We reluctantly allowed her to have 12 invites more for our own sake to stop the complaining.

If the daughter thought these people were important to her she would have invited them herself (I know i did so for a lot of my mothers friends who are like extended family to me). So these people ARENT invited and it seems aren\u2019t even welcome as daughter is resisting. Additionally, these 13 guests will be impossible to avoid. Their presence will be a constant reminder of the frustrations and absence of important people on the grooms side. Seeing these 13 people will make the bride and groom miserable.

Wanting them there because they are close to you and not the couple is even more ridiculous. How do you even plan on paying attention to your daughter and the wedding when you have a whole entourage of your own to entertain?

The groom may have more family/friends that he\u2019d like to invite, but since they\u2019re both limited to a strict amount then he\u2019s leaving people out.

I had more guests as the wedding was where we live and all his family had to come from one province over. My side was filled with relatives, dear life long family friends and friends. I believe some had to sit on his side as the venue didn't put out many extra chairs.", "Same! If my friends kids got married I\u2019d not at all expect an invite. I\u2019d look forward to seeing any photos they can share next time I catch h up with them or whatever they stare on social media. \n\nWeddings cost OP is being controlling \u2018I\u2019m\nPaying for this\u2019 sure but don\u2019t add strings.", "Yep. OP is selfish and shallow. How fragile are these 50 yr friendships that won\u2019t survive not being invited to a friend\u2019s child\u2019s wedding? \nOr a courthouse wedding with a few witnesses and a spectacular honeymoon.", "Ah. I'm sorry to hear you had to go through that struggle. Here's hoping the best is yet to come.", "reminds me, too much of [this sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmD2Y6WxpIw)", "Amen - fellow Gen X", "My parents are like this too\u2026 I love them and they\u2019re kind people but they kind of shot me in the foot for other reasons. They bankroll my brother who is 33 and lives at home. Bought him a car he doesn\u2019t drive and wanted me to sign a contract for a loan of $5k (I quit my job and didn\u2019t ask for this money, it was offered and we declined it) even though they also just bought a BMW. They wanted to sit at our table at our wedding and I had to explain it was for the wedding party and their partners.\n\nMy mom surprised me during our wedding by being very demanding and judgy. In the end I would have just had a party and a pig roast. We had gotten courthouse married 7 months earlier anyway because my husband had a better insurance plan. That generation is wild.", "Loaning Money=My grandma used to say \u201cdon\u2019t ever lend money that you can\u2019t afford to never get paid back\u201d. It makes a lot of sense and has saved me a lot of frustration.  My dad the attorney taught me \u201cput it in writing-even if it\u2019s friends or family\u201d if it\u2019s a bigger amount you expect/have agreed to be repaid\u2026you just never know and it\u2019s always best to be able to prove things\u2026also-get receipt if YOU repay someone!  A post-it note dated and signed is good enough!\n\nAnd OMG my mom is also a boomer and she literally loves me a ton and is extremely proud of me-as long as everything I\u2019m doing falls into her \u201cacceptable\u201d terms and restrictions\u2026step out of line and she is SO COLD.  I try to be so aware of my love actually being unconditional with my son bc of this bc it always felt SO lonely when I was a little lost in life and she had nothing but cutting remarks and \u201ctold you so\u201d type \u201clessons\u201d to throw in my face.  I have literally never known a person so unable to handle the fact that more ways than just HER WAY of doing things exist!!", "Makes sense to me.  A common refrain in my family is that we were all much happier when we were \u201cpoor\u201d (middle class).  Well, my Dad *never* would\u2019ve said that lol (he became insufferable as his income & status increased quickly).  I\u2019m happy for you that your parents weren\u2019t/aren\u2019t like this.", "Yep, we can even look at how advertisers used psychology to change marketing strategies to encourage people to indulge themselves.  Prior generations were practical & wouldn\u2019t make extravagant, flashy purchases.", "My mother in law threw me a baby shower for my first daughter. I was only allowed to invite my mother and grandmother. She invited 30 of her friends.. Of whom I had only ever met 2.", "And the ONLY photo they give MomZilla has greasy Elvis right between the bride and groom with his arms around both of them. Bonus points if he's got a gold tooth or two.\n\nLet her show \\*that\\* to her precious \"social obligation\" friends.", "Elvis might appeal to momzilla.  I say go the alien route.\n\nYTA, so YTA.  I feel for Op's daughter.", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "I already have a severe anxiety disorder along with CPTSD but if I had to deal with a mother like that, I\u2019d find a nice cabin in the woods, become a hermit, and live off the grid. Nobody would hear from me ever again. I love my streaming networks and all that but I\u2019m good with going completely unplugged and only relying on physical paperback and hardcover books for the rest of my life. Cats and dogs are great companions.", "This whole thread reads like a socialite's Mambo #5", "Prior generations definitely did extravagant things, especially if they were rich. We don\u2019t get enough education on the social side of the gilded age but rest assured, those people of almost all classes, were big on ostentatious displays of wealth.", "I\u2019m referring to middle class people.  Also, this isn\u2019t an opinion I pulled from my rear, rather a theory posited by multiple academics & sociologists."]}
