I had wanted to throw her a bachelorette party, go dress shopping, all the fun things to get her ready for a wedding. but she decided she no longer wanted to do any of that. a few days later I reach out to see if she is definitely getting married in Florida, she says yes, I express excitement, that's that. I kinda got upset about not being involved in any of it, not being invited, and not even being told directly by her about her wedding. So I sent her a long text making sure to be kind and respectful and express how happy I am for her, but also expressed how I was feeling little hurt and excluded. Well she did not take it well, and sent me an angry text back basically saying that it was none of my business and how she can't believe I would put a damper on her wedding day and make her feel bad. I apologized. we didn't talk for months. I reached out to get together, we did, and I apologized more. I tried to express my side of things and really listened to her. I apologized, but she did not acknowledge how she hurt my feelings as well. whatever, we move on. still not talking much though. my birthday comes and she goes out of town (we usually celebrate every year and she never goes on trips out of state until she has to). my grandma passes away and she doesn't text to see how I'm doing or comes to the services. later that weekend I got to my bf's friend's wedding, and I end up posting some photos on instagram. my cousin used to hook up with him and gets mad that I go to the wedding and thinks I'm posting pics just to hurt her.

I wasn't posting those photos to hurt her. I was literally just posting photos of my life.

Maybe not so grown up?\n\nShe can do whatever she likes with her life. And so can you. So if she tells you what you have to do regarding other people's weddings , you must feel the same way she did when you told her what you think about the way she has to get married just because you consider her your friend. Both of your opinions should be irrelevant to the other person.\n\nESH.", "NTA\n\nYour friend can have whatever wedding she wants to but she doesn't get to gatekeep your life and what you do.  \n\nTo be honest she sounds incredibly entitled and you are probably better off without her around anymore.", "Oh boy what a dumpster fire.

Dude....", "NTA - but I suspect this woman hasn\u2019t been a very good friend to you for a while.

You know that she expressed that she might leave him. Maybe she is embarrassed that you have this information and instead of handling it like an adult, she is acting this way. \n\nI would say good riddance. She may have been a friend in the past, but she certainly isn't anymore. She is treating you more like an enemy at this point.", "I think you aren\u2019t friends anymore. Hell, she even *told* you she wants nothing to do with you anymore. (But on some level - she is lying- or why would she be looking at your instagram).\n\nAnd why in the world would you text a married woman - that you haven\u2019t talked to in almost a year! To let her know you were going to her ex BF\u2019s wedding? Who would even think to do that??\n\nSo she and her friends have blocked you? Sure they have. I think you should block her on all platforms and post whatever you want. The wedding you went to and put up on Instagram  about wasn\u2019t about her. Except in her mind.

You were upset she didn't tell you, I don't think you're as close as you think you are. \n\nIf she did text you, upset that you posted pictures from her ex's wedding, that's pretty immature. So what that her friends unfollowed you though, they are *her* friends, their opinion doesn't matter, and it's just unfollowing, it's nothing that *actually* *matters*.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
