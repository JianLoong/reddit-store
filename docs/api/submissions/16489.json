I mean granted I hate the names she's suggesting but if you're neutral to a middle name maybe suggest she can go crazy there? The reason I'm a weirdo is because my sister's name is Cara and my SIL's middle name was Lynn so I made my daughters middle name Caralynn to honor both of them. I figured since it was a middle name I could be a little more whacky than I normally would.", "I used to work at a Y and had to create accounts for families. The names were so damn stupid and the parents would get so offended that I assumed little Tiessyon was spelt \u201cTyson\u201d as pronounced", "Woah! You made my eyes bulge! Lol", "No, I think Nova Lynn is fairly usable. The girl can go with the more trendy option or the more traditional option when she\u2019s old enough.", "\u201cFred\u201d is the correct nickname here.\n- signed An Angel Fan", "Did you get them both pregnant?", "Of course. This screams white Midwest woman who has live laugh love signs all over her house and would die for a farmhouse sink. I despise this type of woman, makes us all look bad.", "Novalynn is just out there. Has she explained why she likes the random spellings?\n\nVote: NTA", "Caeleigh is the traditional spelling though.", "Okay. I get that. I need you to realize the difference between disagreeing with someone and then making them feel like shit.\n\nYou're not an asshole because you don't like the name Novalynn. You're an asshole because you think your wife's choices are \"ridiculous\". You're making her feel less than just because she favors a certain style.", "Oh shit, my bad. I didn't realize that being basic is a crime now. That's fucking wild.", "No way!

Her middle name is Jane. I like simple and classic. And no trendy spellings. Just old lady-ish without being elderly \ud83d\ude02", "I wanted to name my daughter Leidy. My husband said no. I maintain that it's a cute name, but imagine calling your mortgage lender and her name is leidy. Or being on the playground and your friends yelling \"hey leidy (lady)!\" All the time. She would have been made fun of all the time. \n\nYour wife needs to imagine your daughter as a successful woman someday, how is she going to be addressed? What is her name going to look like on a business card or an office plaque? Valedictorian and her name is spelled like the cat threw up the alpha-bits?  Come on.", "What about a regular spelling for the first name and your wife can use whatever spelling she wants on the middle name?", "My last name is short but there's 2 \"normal\" versions of it, and that's hassle enough having to make sure it's spelt correctly. Can't imagine giving a kid a complicated spelling for a first name.", "My middle name is Bayleigh (I think I spelled it right\u2026\u2026) originally that was supposed to be my first name\u2026  I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s not", "My last name ends with two vowels. 90% of people just cannot figure out how to pronounce it the first time they read it. \n\nSo when I see \"Caeleigh\" I'm like... that's a fuck disaster waiting to happen.

I hope OP shows his wife that group, so she can see what her ideas would bring her child.", "Come along now, Bort.", "Yes!! I told my husband the same thing! Ooo were expecting our second right now. I should go pick a name from the keychain stand. Haha", "Lana I'm guessing?", "Nope lol, it\u2019s alyssa but they\u2019d call me assyla pronounced Ass-i-la", "I\u2019m impressed that someone dumb enough to name a child like that knows that much of the alphabet.", "Ok, that is THE WORST name I\u2019ve seen.  Ever.", "I AM SPORTICUS!!", "I live in the Deep South. These are names that are popular. I see them a lot at my clinic.

It's actually worse than abcde (apparently pronounced \"Abb-SID-ee\"), which I only found our about because the family was stopped at the airport because the ticket person didn't believe it was a real name.

I know several non-mormon couples who do these ridiculous names. Might be the water.", "Ohh, good point.", "I knew a lady named Mercedes but it was pronounced MUR suh deez.", "That's Haeven backwards, so they should all learn to spell.", "It's not...Nevaeh is.", "This is my least favorite name of all the names in existence.", "They all sound like my cousin\u2019s names.
