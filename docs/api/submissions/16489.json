My wife suggested Caeleigh (pronounced Kailey, and yes she spelled it out). I vetoed it. \n\nShe suggested another name, Ryleigh (Riley, and again she did spell it out). I vetoed it and suggested Riley spelled the normal way. She refused. \n\nShe then suggested Novalynn. I vetoed, suggesting Nora as an alternative. She again refused. \n\nThis continued a few more times, until she snapped at me, calling me unreasonable for vetoing all her picks.

The two or three highest collective scores get taken to the hospital to be decided on, and the final decision can be made when you see that sweet, scrunchy face. \n\nYou may also want to have a boy name handy too, just in case.

So to give a child a name spelled wrong or a spelling that is not common is mean in my opinion. And that doesn\u2019t take into account that kids will pick on her for it. \n\nThe names you chose are very classic and elderly names are coming back so maybe if you find a more unique one she\u2019ll like it. \n\nHere\u2019s a few that I like:\nIda\nAda\nHelena \nGreta\nNorma \nHattie\nMaud\nWinnifred", "Names for children are always two yeses!

I understand your side and I understand hers.\n\n She wants a name that is unique to your child so that she feels special and one of a kind. \n\nYou want your kid to not be made fun of for a dumb spelling of a name, because kids are cruel, and potentially because with a normal spelling she won't have to deal with the problem of never being able to find her name on anything to call her own.

She's coming to you with name options that are as real to her as your options are real to you. And in your mind, you just think they're \"ridiculous\" as if your opinions are the only ones are normal? That she's not capable of choosing a \"normal\" name.
