She's a shy person, if you aren't happy with it, don't date shy people.", "YTA:\n\nShe's not shy when she doesn't text you back right away. She might be busy. She might be in a place where it's not okay to text.\n\nYou don't sound like you're making her comfortable and are actually pushing her away.", "YTA\n\nShyness is not something you get over in a week. It's a personality trait. She will always be shy. \n\nYou are basically telling her to change. She is not the girl for you. Go find someone who's personality you do like and leave this girl alone.", "INFO\n\nFrom an outside perspective, it seems the reason you keep saying \"don't be shy\" to her is that you're trying to pressure her to comply and work for your attention.\n\nIn your own mind, what is your motivation when you tell her not to be shy?", "YTA \n\n>She is a naturally a shy person.\n\nAnd you constantly tell her...", "YTA, and a massively condescending one.", "YTA. It\u2019s clearly not meant to be, sorry to say it. She\u2019s extremely annoyed bc by you saying that constantly, it puts a pressure on her to move at a faster pace than she wants. Maybe she was busy or not in a good headspace to respond and that\u2019s why she was slow to respond, not her being shy.", "YTA For starters, not wanting to always text first or being slow to respond is not being shy. Not wanting more of the snack is not necessarily being shy. And even if it was, that's okay. She can be shy! You're being condescending and making her more uncomfortable.", "YTA, it basically is putting all responsibility on her if things aren't where you want them to be.", "YTA if you don\u2019t like her shyness, that\u2019s on you not her.  Forcing her out of her comfort zone would be for your benefit not hers.  Either accept she needs to go at her own pace or move on.  No one should have to change to make anyone else happy.", "YTA. Speaking as someone who was very shy as well up to maybe 3 years ago ( im almost 27), having someone tell you not to be shy is one of the most annoying things ever along with \"wow, you're so quiet\"\n\nShe's fully aware she's shy. She doesn't need to be reminded every time she interacts with someone, especially someone she is romantically interested in. \n\nI dont know about her, but i used to be (still am) shy around people who are still new to me. It takes me a few good hangouts to start breaking out of that shell. Some people are shy for a reason.\n\nDont expect a text back ever.", "YTA. I\u2019d be rich if I had a dollar for every time somebody told me \u201cdon\u2019t be shy\u201d I\u2019d have more money than bezos.\nIt\u2019s obnoxious, and just because somebody does things different than you doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s them being shy, either.", "YTA \n\nTelling someone repeatedly to not be who they are is a big sign that you don\u2019t like who they are, plus it\u2019s just really rude", "YTA. I agree with her.", "YTA. \"Don't be shy\" is just pressuring her into doing things she doesn't want to/doesn't feel like doing. I get the feeling she's not that into you and you're pushing the relationship on her. Back off and give her space.", "YTA. She doesn't sounds shy. She sounds like she doesn't want to be told she needs to pursue you or respond to messages when it suits you.\n\nAlso, your post history suggests you have always dated men. Is this your first time dating a woman? Not sure what gender you are, but you may be bringing a lot of assumptions with you from prior relationships with men.", "Yes YTA", "YTA. \n\nStop pressuring her. Simple as that. She'll open up to you when she wants to. Your constant nagging of \"Don't be shy\" is making her feel like you're pressuring her and is as she said very condescending (or as you wrote consending). Leave her be; either she'll open up in due time or she will just walk away because of the pressure.", "Bruh, \"You should be different\" is not an A+ strategy. YTA.", "YTA\n\nas someone who has been told this shit all my life, stop, just stop.", "Is that your catch phrase or something? It's an odd thing to repeatedly say to someone. Honestly it comes off as condescending, but also kinda transparently high maintenance and clingy in text form? Idk, but YTA. In the future, just enjoy the company and don't tell people how to be.", "YTA. She's not a puppy you need to coax.", "YTA. \u201cDon\u2019t be who you are.\u201d Why are you dating her if you don\u2019t like her?\n\nMy partner is very shy with new people. They warned me before our first date that they are shy and awkward in person. Did I say, \u201cDon\u2019t be shy\u201d? No. On our first date I worked extra hard to put them at ease and tried to take on the burden of keeping the conversation going and asked questions that would draw them out. Turns out when they are comfortable, they are very chatty and affectionate! And they learned they could trust me because I worked with their personality instead of trying to force them into acting a certain way. We\u2019ve been together five years. You, I fear, are single now.", "YTA. Its annoying", "OP, don't be an Ah. Don't be an ah. Don't be an ah.\n\nIs it fun?\n\nYTA", "YTA - she\u2019s just not that into you. Give her space and quit pressuring her.", "YTA.\n\nI generally disapprove of when someone labels someone else on their behalf, but \u201cshy\u201d specifically hits a nerve. Calling someone shy puts them in a very specific box. It comes with tons of preconceived notions about the person. No matter what they say or do it will all be jerryrigged  to fit that meaning. \n\nFor example, you called shy when she didn\u2019t eat a ton of fries. She wasn\u2019t shy - she didn\u2019t want them.\n\nEvery time she did something you didn\u2019t like you called her shy. You assumed her actions were coming from a place of being held back when they were actually deliberate choices. \n\nPlease stop assuming those different than you are suffering.", "YTA", "Of course you are. Why do you think repeatedly telling someone to not act on their natural manner is the right thing to do? Why do you think it's helpful? If you don't like a shy people then you don't need to date her. It's the same energy as telling people they should smile more. If you don't like her the way she is thenove on. YTA", "Apparently you are to her. Being shy is no crime. You hit a nerve and you still don\u2019t see it. YTA.", "Yta\n\nBeing shy and introverted isn't something everyone can control. It's likely a constant struggle for her, as she probably wants to be better, but it's difficult for her. You reminding her about it so much just shines a light that makes her feel like she's not doing good enough.\n\nNot the greatest analogy, but it's similar to telling someone who's trying to lose weight that they should try to be healthier. On their own, they might be doing extreme diets and working their body to exhaustion and not seeing results, and every time you tell them it makes them feel worse.\n\nYou might think you're helping, but you don't understand her struggles, and if she finds you condescending, then maybe try to evaluate your own actions instead of trying to blame her for her reaction", "YTA--- Yes this statement does NOT make you look good. It implies that you think someone is shy, and the truth is- YOU DONT KNOW THAT.", "Don\u2019t be shy is a hop skip and a jump away from \u201cYou should smile more.\u201d Telling a woman (or anyone, but it most happens in context with women) they need to alter their personality/demeanor to please you is misogynistic and condescending.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You're telling her not to be who she is.", "It sounds like he is attributing a lot of her behaviour to shyness  when actually she just didn't want what he was offering (be it food or a conversation). Assuming she is shy is arrogant and absolutely condescending. YTA.", "YTA. If she is genuinely shy, that\u2019s not going to \u201cfix\u201d her just pressure her. Kinda like when someone says \u201ccalm down!\u201d when I\u2019m upset. Never once worked", "YTA I say this as a shy person myself. Whenever someone tells me to not by shy, it accomplishes absolutely nothing but making me irritated.", "YTA. That pharse is either descenting or manipulating someone in order to push their limits.", "YTA I'm introverted and a bit shy under certain circumstances, and I can tell you right now that I've always hated and been grossed out by guys when they creepily tell me \"don't be shy\" because as a woman I know what that means. It doesn't mean \"please open up and have a conversation with me.\"", "YTA. You are constantly telling her not to be herself. She\u2019s not shy, she\u2019s reserved but once she gets to know you, she opens up and is more outgoing. The fact that she is still reserved around you shows YOU are not making her comfortable. Think about that.", "YTA... You don't seem to be telling her this for her own good. You seem to just be criticizing her. Saying it the way you are is like telling someone with a stutter, \"Just say it!\" It doesn't help.", "YTA... you learned something though. Stop telling people how to feel or act.", "YTA dude. It sounds like \"don't be shy\" you mean \"behave exactly the way I expect and not have any ideas about your own preferences and habits.\"\n\nIf she were asking, I'd tell her not to be shy about dropping your pathetic butt in her rearview.", "YTA, that is so condescending. Dude, just stop.", "Soft YTA\n\nSo expecting someone to conform to your behavioural expectations is a ahole move. Her personality is what it is and you need to either like her for it or move on. If she has a degree of anxiety then her natural position will come across as shy - so you saying \u201cdon\u2019t be shy\u201d is being pretty dismissof who she is. \n\nWhy the soft prefix? Well you have recognised you may be TA and why. You can learn to be a better friend and boyfriend and check your behaviour as a result.", "NAH. She just expressed her feelings toward the way you are talking to her. It's not like you did it on purpose to piss her off. It was an honest mistake. \n\nHonestly... if she is shy... it's a good sign she was comfortable enough to voice her needs with you. Take it as a step forward good communication with her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is she shy or does she just have a life outside of you and know what she wants? You want her to eat more than she wants to - the problem is that she\u2019s obviously too shy to eat more, not that she just doesn\u2019t want to.
