If it wasn't for this then op would be T A.\n\nIf OPs brother was going to use that name then he should at least have talked to OP about it first. I'm not saying he needed to change his mind but the loss of a baby is hard and he owed him that much consideration. Hiding it made the matter worse.\n\nOPs annoyance is understandable, it is also understandable to call his brother out on this. Yes OP can still use the name but pointing out that his brother was a bit of an AH doesn't make op the AH.\n\nMy advice is to just ignore it, name your kid what you would anyway.", "I have the same tradition where myself, my son, my father, my grandfather etc all have the same middle name. It would not bother me at all if my sibling were to also use it. \nIn your situation, I would have to say ESH. You don\u2019t get dibs on a name (especially a middle name). Your brother didn\u2019t need to attack anybody either.\n\nETA - my condolences for your loss. The name you want to give your child is no less significant because someone else has it. My mothers side of my family has many babies that have been given my grandfather\u2019s name as a first or middle name. Try to think of it as a testament to your grandfather, instead of something taken from you.", "I\u2019m going to go against the flow here and say NTA. He purposefully didn\u2019t tell you or talk to you about it. Sure, as other commenters have said, he could also have a special connection to the name (it\u2019s his brother so they have the same father/grandfather). However the normal thing to do is communicate. He is the A hole for not talking to you about it and discussing it with you, especially because that is what you named your child. Yes your child passed, but that was still YOUR CHILD\u2019s name. How many of the people saying Y T. A would be ok with having a kid, naming it, loving it, and then losing that kid, just to have their sibling use that special name for their baby? A year later? That\u2019s crazy. \n\nOp, there\u2019s nothing you can do to change what has been done. All you can control is yourself and how you move on from this. I\u2019d suggest writing him a letter telling your brother that the name was already given to your baby and it hurts you he used the same name and hid it from you. Then you can either go LC or you can be happy he has a kid himself and learn to love that the name is still continuing on, even if not in the way you imagined. \n\nFinally, while you cannot \u201cown\u201d a baby name, it\u2019s common courtesy to not do stuff like this. Just like you shouldn\u2019t name your kid \u201cdiarrhea\u201d or \u201cputin\u2019s buttcheek\u201d but you can. Just because you can does not mean you should.

You already gave that name to a fetus that you and your wife loved and expected to become your child. That was real love and naming, and no one could fault you if you think of him or her as your first child. Since your family knew that, this is awful. That name belonged to someone you lost recently, a loss you're still grieving. It must be incredibly painful and difficult to see that name on a new child now - one who was fortunate enough to be born, unlike your baby. And this child's name will always be a reminder of your loss. I am so sorry, and I wish I had advice for how you move forward.

That is asshole behavior. The fact that your brother didn\u2019t tell you ahead of time means he knew he was being an asshole when he chose that name. \n\nHOWEVER: if there is a part of this story you are leaving out, and your brother has *also* always wanted to name his son this, or had disagreed with your choice to name your son this name, then I\u2019ll amend my choice to E S H", "NTA \n\nY.T.A changed because the brother used the exact first name of a recently lost child as a first name for a new child and kept it a secret. \n\nYeah, that\u2019s pretty heartless and cruel. He should have spoke with OP and explained why he wanted the name. Rather than hiding it and giving Op such a shock \n\nYou can\u2019t own a name. And he used it as a middle name. \n\nAnd cousins can have the same name!", "Okay so you and your wife lost a baby and that was what you named the baby that passed away ?\n\nAnd your brother knew that this was his nephew's name ?", "NTA - I don't think you're an asshole for having the want for that to be respected. I get wanting a special namesake and definitely understand the hurt you feel especially following the loss of your baby. However, no one owns a name. Your brother attacking you also isn't okay. I think you should take time to calm down and step back before you talk to him again about.", "NTA, he was well aware that you hoped the name would be for your own child, and it was rude of him to take it after your wife miscarried. That hurts so much, especially for him to, in a sense, \"reuse\" the name because the baby who likely would have had it didn't make it. It's just plain mean.", "Ultimately, NTA.\n\nIt's a middle name, and your brother can name his kid whatever he wants.\n\nBut he knew this would hurt your feelings and bring up memories of and the pain of your lost baby. And I think this is what you're most upset about, and justifiably so. It's never a good day when someone we love does something that they know is going to hurt us and does it anyway. And then to plan it out for weeks to months?\n\nI don't know how you'll get through this. Your nephew's birth is now forever tied to the loss of your child, and that's a really heavy burden for that relationship to bear. I think you might start with space, and grief counseling is probably in order. Nephew isn't going away, and this will be salt in a wound until you find a way to heal.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "I'd say you're possibly a soft level of AH, only because there's nothing stopping you from still using the name so ultimately, there is nothing to be upset about. There's no rule anywhere about dibs. However, to be honest, I'd be pissed too if my sibling pulled this. I think many people would be, as lots of siblings tell each other their baby name, \"don't steal this,\" list. My own siblings and I have established what names we want and respect each other enough to not use a name if they don't want to share. So even if you're a soft AH at worst, it seems like a justified case for acting a bit spicy. \n\nYour brother on the other hand is a pretty clear AH imo for not just using the name you wanted, but using a name you only didn't get to use yet because you experienced a tragic loss. He made it worse by not even bracing you emotionally for it in advance, having you find out through FB, and attacking when confronted. It was all very insensitive on his end. The fact you were the only ones to not be told the name in advance only would sting more, and also kind of shows he was trying to be sneaky about it. He is not necessarily the AH for using the name you wanted to use, but in how he did it and in how he treated you and your wife when you got upset in finding out the hard way.", "I think NTA. I think it's very inappropriate for your brother to use this name without talking to you about it first, given that it was a name you were planning to use for your own child had he been born (my condolences). Given that he knew about it already that seems insensitive to me, and I think you are within your rights to be upset even if it isn't \"rational\".\n\nI also don't think you should have forbidden him from using the name had he asked, but the fact that he did not doesn't sit well with me.", "NTA.

This was done maliciously and with no communication. Op is 100% NTA.", "Yeah it\u2019s the sneaking it and hiding that cinched it for me. After using it as a first name so there will be a constant reminder. \n\nI honestly read it as it was the middle name.", "No worries! That's why I figured it may help to clarify that.\n\nMy paternal line is identical to OP, but no brother and no kids for me yet. \nNot sure if I'd use my middle name for my son's first name either, but yeah, that's why I saw what he meant more quickly.", "Tell him thanks for naming his child after your deceased child. That shows how much compassion he has for you that he puts a knife in your hearts at this painful time. It takes time to get over this, so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Funnily enough, this happened to my best friend. He eventually got over it, and his first child was a girl on top of that, so it has not been an issue.", "NTA you know your family and they know you, your brother could've talked to you but he chose not to because he knew it may upset you.  If he knew it would upset you a nice person wouldn't do it in the first place but he could've at least texted you a heads up instead of dropping it at a family gathering where you can have a public meltdown.  He set you up to look like an asshole and you took the bait.", "YTA, it's a name, not just a name you share, but the same as your father/grandfather..your bro also wants to have his son share that name.\nYou can't stop your bro from passing on the name to your nephew, because perhaps the name Is also important to ur bro too...", "I'm going to say YTA. My boyfriend's family has a family name and literally every single male in the family has this name, either as a first or middle name. If it's a family name it's a family name. Not just your name.", "NTA. You\u2019re grieving and will continue to grieve your loss for a long time, I can\u2019t imagine the pain you\u2019re feeling but I am very sorry for you and your wife. You don\u2019t give details of your brother\u2019s relationship with your father and grandfather but the truth is, it\u2019s irrelevant because ultimately they\u2019re his father and grandfather too and his intent was the same as yours. My hope is that you\u2019ll talk, a lot. Talk about the pain you\u2019re going through and let your brother talk about his reasoning. If you can do that without judging or reacting, it\u2019ll go a long way to helping you heal. Again, my condolences.", "NTA I know no one owns a name, but he knew exactly how you felt about this and didn\u2019t care. I just feel anyone in that situation that was actually considerate would not do that. You can still use the name. If they have a problem with that then too bad.", "Nta- I\u2019m sorry for you and your wife\u2019s loss. Your brother is an assjole for not even talking to you about it knowing this. In some case, yes, you can\u2019t claim a name, but this is more than that.", "NTA for being upset because I understand that losing a child is a sensitive subject but if it's a middle name I don't understand why you can't share it. Yes he definitely should have discussed it with you but it's still the name of his father, his grandfather and his brother. If it's a middle name, why can't you guys share it? My and my brother's middle name is shared by a few members of my family and we joke about it. I would look at it as honoring the name, not stealing it.", "NTA and don\u2019t listen to those calling you an a-hole. Your brother knew what he\u2019s doing and if he\u2019d truly care about you and your wife he would\u2019ve told you beforehand the name of his son. All the best to you and your wife.", "YTA. Your brother did not give his child your middle name; he gave it *his father's and grandfather's name*.\n\nDespite it being only your middle name, it's clear that you are very possessive about it, so I can understand why he didn't tell you - he certainly didn't have to ask you - first.", "NTA he knew what he was doing was upsetting or he wouldn\u2019t have kept it a secret.\n\nFood for thought though, you can still name your baby after you. I have three cousins named Josh. Three Ambers, two robins, several uncle Gary\u2019s\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. I wish you two the best.", "Soft ESH.  If it was a name that was unrelated to your family I'd totally understand, but why wouldn't your brother be allowed to name his kid after his grandfather? Cousins having the same name isn't uncommon when it's a name that runs in the family. Your brother shouldn't have attacked your wife either.", "Yta stop being so dramatic that he chose to use  \u201cyour name\u201d who says you can\u2019t still use the name? And he may be trying to honor you or your loss child in someway. You never will know because I\u2019m sure when you found out you jumped down your brothers throat with that text you sent. \nIf it bothered you you should have called and congratulated your brother and eased into the conversation. Then you would have had the info you needed.", "YTA it's a family name not YOUR name only. He can name his kid after his granddad and father. It is not up to you and ridiculous to get butt hurt over it. You are being extremely overdramatic.", "Why do you feel that this name is more meaningful to you than to your sibling??\n\nYTA. You don't have rights to a name.", "NAH. I don't get this reserving a name thing. Not to be harsh but you and your wife may never have a child. Does the name have to die out with you?\n\nI don't think you're an AH for being disappointed and annoyed but equally I don't think he's a AH for picking a name he likes for his son.  There are literally thousands of families where kids of a generation have the same first name. Hell, you guys even do that odd giving a kid your own name thing and then wacking Jr on the end. \n\nIf he did it spitefully to get at you then that's a different matter.", "This isn't an advice sub. YTA for asking here.", "Yta. You can't gatekeepe names. Your father and grandfather were also related to your bro", "I feel like we are only getting half the story. More so than usual.\n\nINFO: You say your brother attacked your wife. What did he say? \n\nINFO: Were the doctors able to identify the cause of the miscarriage? Have you been told that your wife might not be able to have children?\n\nYour brother should have communicated his intentions to you in advance, but you don't own the name.  If your wife has been told that she can't have children, then I can't entirely blame your brother for giving this name to his child.", "ESH. Your brother is an AH because he didn't tell you he was using the name. That tells me that he likely is trying to pull one of those \"I've used the name so you can't use it, ha ha\" type of things which in and of itself is an major AH thing to do. He also should not have gone attacking your wife, unless you and/or your wife said something rude to him in your conversation first (particularly if anything said could be perceived as an attack on his child). Considering that you say he immediately went into attack mode after you texted him, it likely is a case about something rude being said by you first and included something about your wife or something in your text was perceived to be an attack on his child. Keep in mind that what you believe you said and what others understand you to have said can easily be two completely different things. You are the AH because you really have no right to gatekeep a name. There is no rule anywhere that states only one family member in every generation can have a specific name or that cousins can't share a name, no matter how common or unique the name may be. Also, you've said that you planned to use the name for your firstborn son. You mention your loss, and I am sorry for your loss, but you never said that you knew it was a boy and that you had already assigned the name although we still go back to no right to gatekeeper a name. For all we here on reddit know  it was a girl and you wouldn't have been using that name right now anyway. Now if you KNEW the baby you lost was going to be a boy AND you had already given the child that name, then your brother is a MASSIVE AH for using the name without telling you so close to your loss and you are only softly an AH simply because you really can't gatekeep a name that he has as much right to name his child as you do. As for moving past this, your choices are to either accept that he also named his son the name you had chosen and will likely use in the future for when you do finally have a son or cut him and his immediate family off completely and never go to any family reunions or events where you know he will be there (in short disown him and his immediate family). Keep in mind that if your extended family chooses to take the middle ground and stay out of your spat and you take option 2, you are likely going to be alienating yourself from your extended family because they will still be inviting him to reunions or major events just as they will be inviting you.", "ESH- You can\u2019t own a name, but them being all secretive about it is underhanded af", "Thinking the same thing. I wouldn't allow a sibling or cousin to stop me from naming my kid what I want. If OP's middle name fits one of his kids I say go for it.", "It's not him using the name, it's him not discussing the use of the name with OP, despite knowing that the name has a special connection to OP, and that OP would still be in pain from losing a baby with that name. And then when being asked about it, calling OP an asshole.", "Did you miss the part where Op told them they were using the name with their child -- and lost the child? Using the name of a recently miscarried directly family member's child for your own healthy kid without talking to them is beyond cruel.", "OP was using the name with a child they recently miscarried. It's not at all the same thing as just a name his relatives had. It's the name they intended for a recently lost child.", "They were using it with their recently miscarried child ...", "They were pregnant and talked about using the name with their soon to be child - and had a miscarriage. They've recently lost a child they were intending to call this name. It's not at all the same thing as just holding on to a name or wanting to some day use it. The pregnancy existed.", "How is it insensitive? Brother maybe honoring their loss.. he jumped straight into accusations and probably cussing out his brother (cause you know his text wasn\u2019t nice that he sent) and brother retaliated. His family is right to stay out of it and her family should have stayed out of it too. He should have called and talked to his brother about the name to try and figure out a reason. It may not be as nefarious as you are trying to make it out to be.", "OP told them all they were naming their child that name - and then it died. He isn't calling dibs on it - he was using it with the child they just lost. It's horrifically cruel to take your sibling's recently miscarried child's name for your own healthy child without talking to the parents first. To blindside them with it? Man, that's beyond cruel.", "You already gave that name to a fetus that you and your wife loved and expected to become your child.", "If his brother was honoring their loss, he should have giving them a heads up at least. Not keeping the name a secret and letting them find out the way they did.", "Couldn't agree more!", "Did you miss the part where it was what they were naming their recently miscarried child? This isn't a theoretically some day using it name - OP told them he was naming his kid that, and then lost his kid.", "Never heard of respect?\nEnjoy having no family or friends in 10 years if you live your life this way.", ">He is proud and happy to share the name with some of his relatives\n\nBecause they're different generations. \n\n>but sharing it with his nephew makes him angry.\n\nOP's brother already knew that OP was going to give the name to his son.", "I'm sorry but OP IS the AH, as is the brother."]}
