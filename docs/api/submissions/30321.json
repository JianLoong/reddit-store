I started to take her with me to get our hair and nails done. After our spa day together we usually go out to a bakery for lunch.

Next time talk to your husband first, let him know you feel really uncomfortable directly disobeying the mom but don't want to hurt your stepdaughter. After you've talked, bring your daughter into the convo too, she's old enough to have rational opinions and want her preferences heard.
