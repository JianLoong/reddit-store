You\u2019re not intentionally the asshole but you kinda are still sadly.\n\nYou are your daughters advocate, and in a family with her father, not the mother. The mother has been disconnected and you did fill that roll. You can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t- you put in the work by taking her out all the time and bonding, in a time where that girls mom was gone.

It\u2019s not the mothers place considering custody, and I\u2019d expect my partner to discuss this before making the choice ultimate. \n\nHowever I see how you intended this. You tried to hard to play nice here and it played out badly. You can\u2019t follow moms lead when she\u2019s lacking in being a parent and your husband is the involved one with you.

You have to realize you're the primary mother figure in their life, don't let the ex who isn't around determine what you can and can't do. \n\nAnd be honest with your kid, you can very easily make this up to her by being truthful about why you initially cancelled spa days while simultaneously uncancelling them and she will forgive you.", "YTA. Typically, it would be a great stepparent move to respect the bio parent\u2019s wishes. But this isn\u2019t typical.
