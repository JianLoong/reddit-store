If they showed up early without notice, then its their own fault.\n\nI don't think they are intentionally being assholes, they probably thought they were doing a favor by showing up early and getting done work quicker so they can get home.

It's their own fault they were annoyed.  They could have gone for a cup of coffee or something until the time for the scheduled appointment.\n\nYour contractor previously showed up unannounced.

Would letting them in really such a big deal?", "YTA, they're probably not going to take the job, or charge a lot more now.

They were just doing what's normal for their industry.", "What makes them assholes? Being annoyed that they have to wait outside because they weren't there at the \"agreed time\"? They can't move on to the next job in the meantime, so they're forced to just sit there and wait.", "Someone close to me was sexually assaulted by a stranger working on her house when he realized they were alone without her husband. It\u2019s a risk I wouldn\u2019t take.", "Their failure to plan doesn't constitue an emergency for everyone else.\n\nSome basic organisation and planning from trades would greatly improve their reputation.", "yeah just seems weird they\u2019d show up an hour early", "To what end though? What would they have done differently if they had called ahead and she said she wouldn't let them in until 4 pm? They'd still have sat in her driveway and waited.", "Who says they assumed anything? You finish one job, you move on to the next. If the client isn't home yet, you sit in the driveway and wait...which is what they did. They didn't \"waste their own time\" - contractors have a list of jobs to do, in a certain sequence. They can't go back to the office in between.", "Showing up an hour and a half early is kinda shitty. That said, I think she was shittier.", "They could wait literally anywhere else. Like a coffee shop.", "That\u2019s their own stupid choice then.  Thh h E meeting was at 4, they should go sit somewhere else entirely until at least 3:30 and not even create this situation", "That is not remotely how it is done by any legitimate contractor that is worth hiring. Standard procedure is to call if early slots free up in the day. \n\nEven if someone is home they have no way of knowing if being early is something that can be accommodated. Appointments exist for a reason. They could have guests over at this time, watching someone else's kids. If they wfh they could be in meetings until the appointment time. Hell, they could have even planned on some afternoon delight. Sure, it's great to be able to wrap up the day early but if the client can't accommodate it then you go get some coffee and take a break if there's no other job to go to.", ">the contractor doesn't get to decide to change the meeting time without warning just because their circumstances changed\n\nWhen one job is done they move on to the next. They're showing up early because they have nowhere else they can be for that hour and a quarter.", "And that's OP's problem to deal with....how exactly? They made an appointment at 4pm, if OP didn't arrive home early in the first place, they'd have been sitting around that long anyway. If they wanted to change the appointment, that's what the client contact number is for, not just hanging out in the clients driveway hoping for the best.", "They have nowhere else to be? Exactly why they can wait for her husband", "NTA. Your safety and your child\u2019s safety should come first. When my apartment\u2019s building maintenance came to do a routine check today, they saw that I (F21) was home alone and asked if I\u2019d like them to come back in a few hours when someone else was home too. In an apartment. Where I could have screamed and been heard by 10+ people who know me by name had anything been tried. The contractors should have understood why you were unwilling to let them into a house (which is much more vulnerable than an apartment in this regard) while alone with your child", "Absolutely NTA. Just because their other work finished earlier than expected doesn't mean that they can jump ahead of an agreed appointment time. And you don't need to provide them with any explanation for making them wait till the agreed upon time.", "NTA  They could have called to see if it was all right to come early.  However since you told them to wait outside instead of coming back at the scheduled time they may try to charge you for that time.", "NTA. If the contractor and plumber can't property manage their time, its their fault, not OP's. As a homeowner, I would have a significant issue with anyone who pulled that on me. If they can't be trusted to honor a simple meeting time, where else will they break your trust?", "NTA, they are men that you do not know.  It was just you and your daughter in the house.  If they give you a hard time let them know that you can find another contractor and leave a review with what went down.", "INFO:  did they give a reason for being so early?  In my experience plumbers give a window and contractors do actual appointments but I have never seen one be early (have seen plenty be late.)  An hour & 15 minutes early is extreme.", "It seems counterproductive to open the door and tell them that her husband isn\u2019t there when she\u2019s concerned about being alone with two strange men without her husband \u2026", "I don't think they were coming to start the job. To me it reads that the contractor was bringing over the plumber to double check what would be needed etc so that they could have everything ready to start the job another day.", "The point is if you agreed to a certain very specific time, that\u2019s when you show up. If you end your day at 4 you obviously wouldn\u2019t take an appointment for 4 but these contractors did so that\u2019s the time they need to honor.", "And what happens when the client isn\u2019t home yet? This is such a shit way for an industry to run. Go chill at a coffee house or something but just showing up hours early isn\u2019t cool. Keep your word and show up on time", "They made an appointment with Mr. OP for 4:00 PM.  They showed up early without calling Mr. OP and confirming he was available early.  He isn\u2019t, which Mrs. OP confirms to them.\n\nThey ask if they can get started anyway.  Mrs. OP, with whom they did not have an appointment says no, and reminds them the appt was for 4:00 PM.\n\nThey don\u2019t know what Mrs. OP has going on in the house between 2:45-4:00.  Nor do they need to know.  They had an appointment with a specific person at a specific place and time.", "I don\u2019t understand how the industry can justify this. A 4pm appointment means 4pm. You wouldn\u2019t keep your word? That\u2019s not very honorable or professional", "An agreed to time is an agreed to time. Especially when you\u2019re coming to someone\u2019s home it\u2019s rude to just show up outside of agreed to time. Sucks if you have extra time, get lunch or something but coming to someone\u2019s property over an hour early and getting irritated you aren\u2019t let in is not professional. It\u2019s not the clients problem the contractor has extra time. 4pm means 4pm, being punctual is professional. Showing up whenever shows a lack of respect for the clients time and their personal boundaries. You\u2019re going into someone\u2019s private space, they need to respect boundaries and agreed to times. You don\u2019t get to just agree to a time and do whatever whenever and expect the client to adapt to you.", "I totally had that thought.", "I understand your side of things and can\u2019t blame you. But everyone\u2019s missing the other half of the argument. \n\nSkilled labor professionals have wonky schedules due to a number of things. Previous Job took longer or was quicker, previous job got cancelled, most of us are out of towners so a long drive, getting gas, and etc. \n\nNot even out of spite and with the upmost respect, not many companies/crews could afford to wait outside a clients house for an hour. Unless your working for a major company your getting paid by the Job not the hour.\n\nDue to the nature of things it\u2019s sadly a now or later scenario, sadly.", "Literally anything else cause there was nothing they could do until 4. Go get a coffee and take a piss while they got some time. I think it's rude to just sit in the driveway like that for an hour in the first place.", "You say it's a good idea to be communicative, the contractors should have rang them up to ask is it ok to come around early.", "4pm means 4pm."]}
