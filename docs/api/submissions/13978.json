TL:DR - I am a petty bitch. \n\nI LOVE my coffee in the morning. I used to love it very sweet, with Sweet Cream Creamer, and then I would pile the whipped cream on top. From the can. I would buy the biggest can of it too. It had MY name on it. I mean, HELLO?!?! That meant...don't touch it. I could let the fact go that someone use my creamer because I substituted milk, but my whipped cream...hell to the no. One day I bought a BRAND FUCKING NEW CAN...two days later, it was gone. WHAT THE FUCK???? In two days! No way, I knew there was a thief. I had an inkling of who it was, but she wouldn't fess up to it when I asked. So, I got another can...sure as shit...about 4 days later, GONE! Now, I said I piled my whipped cream up, but there was no way I put enough whipped cream on my coffee for it to be gone in 4 days. So, I thought, and thought, and then came up with the perfect solution. A good old switch-a-roo! I got a new can, then the old one...took the new can up there, we were all gathered round the coffee pot that morning and I made my coffee. (I had the old one beside me, but out of sight), and then I squirted my whipped cream all on top of my coffee and then I did a quick switch with the new can and old can. (I was slick too!) I took the old can and I tongued the shit out of the top of it. I made like I was licking all the whipped cream off. There was enough left in there to get some out too. LMAO. One of the girls started laughing and she was in on it and she asked me if I did that after every time, and I was like...yep...almost every time, I lick it clean! The lady who was using my whipped cream got PISSED!!!! She was like...That's disgusting! Why?? You could get me sick! LMAO! I just held the can up, pointed at my name, then said, \"If you see this name, it says mine, not yours. And the bottle is empty. Next time, don't eat stuff that's not yours and you won't have to worry about Herpes, AIDS, or any other communicable diseases. Stew on that.\" \n\nI am petty as shit. :-)", "NTA, I need my snacks. I would be feral without them.", "And can\u2019t take a hint either, holy shit. \n\n> As an only child thats a huge nono for me. \n\nOnly child has nothing to do with it - that\u2019s a huge no-no in general. \n\n> Steve said \u201cshe shares I can take it\u201d \n\nFirst, OP gave zero indication they share.\n\nSecond, even if they do, the audacity of this dude.

How are these people not mortified walking into a completely different office and treating it like a communal dispensary?\n\n> **She asks me why I have everything locked.**\n\n**HOLY. SHIT.**\n\nThat was clearly either an attempt to guilt you because she knew it was to keep her out and didn\u2019t think you\u2019d admit it (people like this will genuinely be so twisted in their own head that they will think you\u2019re actually the one in the wrong for locking it at all), or she\u2019s actually the most oblivious, ignorant person in all the land.\n\nAgain\u2026 what possible answer to this question were they expecting besides \u201cto keep people out?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s where I keep my stash of pirate gold?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the drawer is opened, it will unleash a terror the likes of which Pandora couldn\u2019t even conceptualize?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, it\u2019s locked?
