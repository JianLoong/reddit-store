I was at my university the other day doing work during an hour break I have between classes. I was sitting at a table that was near my class in an area with a few chairs and tables. All of the other tables were taken by other students but a few of the chairs were free. I wait at the same spot every day and every day I see the same girl sitting at the same table, the table I was using. However, I got there well before her this time and when she arrived she went straight up to me and said \u201cthis is my table.\u201d It\u2019s pretty obvious that this girl has some kind of intellectual disability, she slurs her words and speaks very simply. I tried my best to be very nice to her, I smiled and told her that would prefer to stay because I was working on an assignment on my essay, but she could have one of the free seats nearby. She got really huffy and told me again that this was HER table. I remained polite and told her that she didn\u2019t have any more right to the table than I did. She got a knot in her face and walked off. A moment later she returned with a security guard (!?) who asked me to leave. I asked him why so he pulled me aside and told me to stop being so difficult and to just leave because the girl was clearly disabled. I said disabled or not she didn\u2019t have the right to boss me around, and neither did he. But I said whatever and left anyway because my class was starting soon. So AITA?\n\nEdit to clarify: I arrived at the same time I always do, not early, when I said \"arrived well before her\" I meant that she was late. She's typically there before me, but that day she was not. Also, I did not know she was disabled before she spoke to me, I meant that it became obvious when she spoke, you couldn't tell just by looking at her. My apologies.\n\nEdit for more clarification: I would have shared the table but it was a single-person table with only one chair, as were the other tables in the area. The available seats were sofa chairs, not table chairs, so they could not have been pulled up to the table. The table I chose was the only available table and I was writing on loose paper.\n\nAnother edit: The girl only said one thing to me \u201cthis is my table\u201d (x2) before getting security.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Ok, I should have given her the table.

I know first hand, changing the routine of someone with autism can really rock their world. My organization is very community inclusion focused and want to ensure they live the same lives as everyone else. We teach and train them everything we can as far as how to cope with various feelings and scenarios. We focus mostly on ADL\u2019s (activities of daily living). That also being said with my consumers, goes very poorly frequently. I will give you my personal and professional opinion\u2026 YOU ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE AND I APPLAUD YOU. We do not punish any of our consumers for their outbursts ever. They all have their own rooms and are never treated poorly bc of their issues. However, our primary teaching device is natural consequences. In general, everyone is so kind and catering to my consumer\u2019s that they never see any natural consequences either. One of my consumers have (violently) assaulted officers multiple times. They have also gone to court multiple times. This consumer is very high functioning. However all charges have always been dropped. This person is over 18 as well. I have experienced this many times. If the girl you are referring to is at a college level, she needs to be ok with not getting her way everyday. Coddling her is not real world and she needs to experience this sooner than later.

Perhaps this student felt they didn't need to request a specific accommodation for an assigned/preferential seat because up until this point, they have been able to sit in a seat that gives them the best access to the class and what they need.

Everyone is an adult and doesn\u2019t need their hand held. Where I went to college you would meet with the office of disability services, get your accommodation letters, and meet with your professor to give them the letter. Simple as that. I\u2019ve taught college classes and had students give me their accommodation letters. All that\u2019s needed is that conversation at the beginning of the semester. No need for all the drama", "There are a number of colleges/universities in the US that offer inclusive postsecondary programs for young people with intellectual disabilities.  Typically the students in these programs will attend for 2-3 years and earn a certificate or (rarely) an associate's degree.   The programs often include having on-campus jobs, \"life skills\" programs, and living in a special dorm or apartment with additional support staff.    \n\nIn order for families to get financial aid for these programs, at least half of the courses or on-campus work experiences have to be inclusive - so the colleges will put the students in normal classes, but they're graded on a different scale.  \n\nThe idea is not really to earn an academic degree in most cases, but to give the students the skills to be able to live as independently as possible and find meaningful work.", "Ooof. No. \u201cThose people\u201d were in a work study program where they gained life skills by working in the library or the cafeteria, and they were able to take classes with the general population but on a pass/fail basis. They received a different certification of completion of the program. Most,\nIf not all, were people with high support needs autism or Down syndrome, and their parents were not paying thousands bc they were working at the school.", "But that was the only table. OP didn\u2019t move to another table (a reasonable accommodation for a neurodiverse routine), it would have meant giving up a library table that they had a legitimate need for themselves (not reasonable, IMO).", "The other chairs were much bigger and shorter, more like sofa chairs than table chairs. And it was a single-person table, so it was quite small.", "A disability table would be for physical disabilities. It would be lower for people with wheelchairs and other mobility devices to access it more easily. I've seen tables and carrels like that at libraries.\n\nSomeone with mental disabilities wouldn't have the same needs for that specific type of accommodation.", "I have been informed of the importance of routine for intellectually disabled people in this comment section and I agree. Writing on my lap would have been super annoying but not more stressful than changing the routine would be for her, especially when I got stubborn. Thank you for your insight, I\u2019ve learned a lot", "And before anyone comes for you \"but she's at college. \" First, no one knows *why* she is there, its assumptions, and even IF she is a student, this does not mean she is capable of understanding these situations. Does it mean she owns the table? No. Do you have to give up the table? No. But reality is your arguing with someone who essentially lives a life that children are expected to live and many folks sadly work for pennies due to their disability and pass high school not knowing nearly half of what their peers do due to the issues with the special needs educational system on top of learning disabilities. They have very little say in their home life or social life and depend on others extensively to just do basic things people take for granted every day. \n\nIs OP necessarily in the wrong? No. But it would have been nice to maybe put himself in someone else's shoes. In the end, it really is just a table. Not just for her but for him too.", "I was going to say the same thing as someone who works with IDD individuals as well. Routine is the most common think I hear from my individuals that is important to them. I have seen what seems like a tiny change in their schedule (such as taking up their table) has caused massive behaviors. I\u2019m talking hitting, screaming, total lack of focus for the rest of the day. This is not due to being \u201cspoiled or treated differently\u201d this is due to a legitimate diagnosis. It\u2019s literally a brain thing, redirection only works on some people, they are different and react to different things just like everyone else. That\u2019s for brining this up! I don\u2019t think people think about this all that often", "Exactly, and what if she encounters this situation again but the person occupying the seat reacts in an unkind or aggressive way to being asked to move? I\u2019d be concerned about this happening again in the future, with the wrong kind of person.", "This is what I'm stuck on I'm the same way just to a lesser degree with intensity with seats. If my only option isn't my normal ill talke it but it still feels wrong and uncomfortable and something that I have to mentally adjust to and i think my description is underselling it I don't think there's any way to describe it where neurotypicals could understand the intense panic and fear and discomfort I feel because to them it's just a seat I don't own it and logically I know that. It's just really fucking hard to work through those feelings I also wonder if there could've been compromise like was there enough room and chairs l at the table that both op and the girl could sit there if there wasn't enough chairs could they drag one over hell even explaining I have class in x number of minutes can you wait til then could've been a great compromise because sometimes having my routine thrown slightly rather than altogether and being made aware of it is helpful idk I'm going with nah op is right but it does seem like a weird hill to die on and honestly given my experiences I can understand op not even being aware of how important structure and routine is to ppl like me or who have similar experiences", "You were right. Disabled people are by definition a minority and legally considered so. Disabled people are actually the largest minority group in the US.", "You can be both, and either can be correct. Protected characteristics are protected from discrimination, things like race, gender, sexuality and, in this case, disability (I'm not listing them all). A minority is a group of people with a shared characteristic that is not shared with the majority of society, most people are ethnically British in the United Kingdom so people of Chinese decent would be a minority. Being a minority is not a protected characteristic, vegans are a minority in society but have no legal protection based on their diet. Same with having a protected characteristic, woman aren't a minority for example but you can't discriminate against an individual for their gender, but protected characteristics and minority status are often linked.\n\nGod this was a massive word vomit but hope it makes sense!", "No, it's not. Disabled people are considered a minority.", "Exactly he\u2019s not wrong but still looks like an asshole for being in the right.", "I do not, and I admit I am ignorant on the subject. I\u2019ve been informed by others in the comments about the importance of routine for intellectually disabled people. If I could go back in time, I would give her the table", "I have a stepdaughter who is intellectually disabled. She is/was fully capable of having a productive life but both her parents have coddled her her entire life and now shes just a spoiled entitled brat who thinks the world is there to do everything for her while she sits back and plays on her phone. Shes about to turn 26.

Which may be the case in some situations but with intellectually challenged people it can be hard. I also say NTA because you handled the situation beautifully OP a lot of people today don\u2019t have the patience to deal with mentally challenged individuals. However I think maybe you could have switched seats just to be kind. Remember their is a reason that mentally handicapped individuals take social skills classes but the majority don\u2019t put the teachings into use in our daily lives. Thank you for treating the individual as a person and not their diagnoses", "Agreed with the *big caveat* that while the guards should be trained to deal with complex interpersonal situations, especially in an educational setting, I don't think that's necessarily a given. The responsibility lies with school to provide that type of skills training. 100% agree they should do this, especially when placing staff in roles that are imbued with some sort of \"policing\" authority\n\nI'm in school now at a large state university. Honestly, I would be shocked if our security staff had been trained in this way. The impression I get is that the  security staff here seems to be separate from the academia (adinistrators, educators, admissions, support staff, etc)  side of things in a stratified blue collar/white collar model. It doesn't seem that kind of investment is happening with the security, maintenance, grounds, and service staff.", "I'd be interested to see the results of such programs both in ways of how successful they are in results for successful career prospects, mental health, etc.", "Ah gotcha", "You're more than likely right that it is a coping mechanism. Still, she coped in an AH way.", "it's okay! :)", "For all those saying you could have been kinder, you were there first, were already working & there were no other adequate tables. Politely refusing to leave was fine, imo. \n\nBy your updates, your kindness will show itself later, by your not sitting at \u201cher\u201d table in the future.", "Routine is a HUGE deal, even for folks with much milder levels of disability. Sometimes the biggest sign of autism is inflexibility (which lacking other info just looks like someone being stubborn, refusing to accommodate or change. When they literally *can't*.)\n\nThank you for hearing as people describe parts of this. It's complicated, and \"invisible\".", "You're infantilizing disabled people by calling us special needs. And the way you talk about disability is not great tbh Saying this as a disabled person. Yes the goal is to live as independently as possible but some accommodations and assistance is necessary. \n\nYes, disabled people should be treated like equally but you do have to understand how things affect them. Disrupting a routine can be really damaging for people with certain disabilities. I would hope you'd understand that if you've been around disabled people a lot. Or know how to talk about us in a less dismissive, infantilizing way...\n\nEdit I'll just leave these resources why special needs is an offensive term right here. I love how disabled people tell you how to talk about us and treat us and people don't listen.\n\nQuote from [this article](https://www.fatherly.com/health/special-needs-euphemism-hurts-disabled-kids#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpecial%20needs%E2%80%9D%20doesn't,people%20who%20are%20already%20marginalized.)\n\n\"\u201cSpecial needs\u201d doesn\u2019t achieve the purpose behind euphemisms: dulling the negative impact of the words it sets out to replace.

Many people with intellectual disabilities would not be able to handle this situation at all. I have an invisible disabilities and even if I were using accommodations that I needed I would offer them up to someone if it were clear they needed the space more. It\u2019s called being kind because you don\u2019t have to do it but when it takes literally nothing from you and means so much more to someone else. Why couldn\u2019t op just move, or offer extra space at the table? They weren\u2019t wrong, but they were unkind.", "It does, thank you!", "I have two cousins with ASD, one was coddled while young and had to fight to learn what normality is in his teenage years, it was difficult but he has done a phenomenal job in adjusting to the real world and is absolutely thriving.

It breaks my heart.", "That is all true but it\u2019s also true that coddling those people is not the responsibility of every random person they come into contact with. Uncomfortable situations are going to happen, there are many people who will be incredibly unkind in shutting down that sort of entitlement. I understand the reasons behind it but that\u2019s exactly what it is, entitlement, and it will not go down well with a lot of people.\n\nAnyone encouraging someone with an ID to stay in that mindset is ultimately harming them. Part of life is learning to be uncomfortable, frustrated, disappointed and how to cope with those feelings. It\u2019s absolutely ok to feel those things but everyone needs to learn how to process them too. \n\nI\u2019m not ignoring the fact that there are people who are not capable of understanding these things but those people typically need a carer with them in public situations anyway, there are safe spaces for those people too. There is also people with ID who are very academically gifted but can\u2019t cope with social situations at all, it\u2019s sad but most places just can\u2019t  cater to that without a carer present.
