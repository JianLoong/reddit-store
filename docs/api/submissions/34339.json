That means all six of their children and their extended family (roughly 125 people) are going on a week-long vacation in March.\n\nI adore my grandparents but have a complicated relationship with my parents. In short, they're incredibly emotionally immature and care entirely too much about how they appear to others and not enough about how we as a family are functioning. Because of this, one of my older sister's, Brittany (20f), has fallen into addiction. Though I've tried my best to help her, without the support of my parents there's very little I can actually do. \n\nThey told me it was my responsibility to take care of her, so when she lost everything after her DUI my senior year in high school, I completely rearranged my life to cater to her. I stayed home my first year of college and took her to and from all of her appointments, took her to work and school, etc. I sacrificed my life so that it *looked* like our family was functioning even though we weren't.\n\nUnfortunately with addiction, there's always the chance of relapse and my sister relapsed hard. She OD and I found her and had to rush her to the hospital. Still, my parents refused reasonable help. So, I stopped doing everything and decided to go to the school of my dreams and live *my own* life. After a week of having to actually parent, I got the \"apology\" call and the request to support her again. I denied them, and have 100% been independent since.\n\nWhich brings us back to the cruise.\n\nLast week my parents called to inform me that I'm expected to go on this cruise and pay for everything myself- which is fine. I'm adult. However, I was not expecting to pay for Brittany. My parents said without reliable transportation, she's been unable to maintain a steady income and it's my fault for moving away, so it's reasonable for me to pay for her and have her pay me back. I told them no and asked why they couldn't. Turns out, in addition to paying for my younger sister Callie (16f), they've also decided to pay for my nieces (2f, 3f, 5f) and two step sisters (28f, 24f). I double downed- I'm paying for my own school and don't want to dip into my savings when I know I won't get paid back. But now I'm getting non-stop hate messages from the rest of the family. I don't think I'm being unreasonable, but with my grandparents are calling me begging me to go on the cruise and to just go ahead and pay for my sister, I'm waivering. AITA if I still refuse?  \n\n**TL/DR:** My sister can't afford the family cruise due to a DUI, my parents told me I have to pay for her to go or risk embarrassing them in front of the rest of the family. I don't want to spend my savings, but they say if I don't do this I won't be allowed to go either.

You're right.\n\nNot only should you not pay for your sister for this trip -- you need to make sure that your finances are totally separate from the rest of your family. Never give them any money.

You are the child. An adult child who is taking care of herself. It's time for your parents and their other adult child to do the same. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. I'm sorry your family is being a gaggle of them though.", "NTA she is their daughter, if anyone is responsible for her, they are.\n\nFrankly they should be embarrassed", "You are not responsible for your sister and have gone above and beyond. You parents are choosing to pay for people they don\u2019t need to over her. If your family wants her there so bad have them chip in and cover her cost. If she goes who is babysitting her on this cruise?", "Please cut ties with this horrible family NTA btw \nDo not attend the cruise and when asked why, let em know until I\u2019m respected I will no longer be involved with this family. \nGood luck \ud83e\udec2", "NTA. You will never recoup the funds if you buy her a spot and that will open the door to be guilted into even further helping your sister out.  This feels like the moment you need to show you\u2019re not playing their shitty game.  \n\nIf it was me, I would go on the cruise.  I would have a guilt free fun trip ignoring my parents.  I would do you.  If anyone says anything you just say yeah I wish my parents would help her out, but they just keep dumping it on me.  F\u2019 them.  They are shitty parents to you and they are shitty parents to your sister.  They have to earn family respect and they lost that long ago.", "No is a complete sentence.", "I would suggest that you contact your grandparents or whichever family member has organized this cruise and lay out exactly what's going on.  All of it.  You are an adult.  Your parents aren't in a position to prevent your from participating if you're paying for yourself.\n\nI think it's time for you to stop being guilt tripped into taking care of your parents' desire to look good, or into taking over parenting responsibilities for your sister.  Her situation is tragic, but sadly, you cannot pull her out of addiction; the motivation has to come from her.\n\nPlease lead your own life and do what is best for you.  Don't let your parents twist things to make themselves look good and you feel bad.\n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nDon't pay for it and don't go on this cruise. It's going to be horrible. Save the money and do something fun with friends instead. If your grandparents ask, explain that you have been used by your parents and blamed for your siblings addiction problems, and now you are expected to pay for her. But you are not her parent and you can't be. The grandparents can be the parents instead, or your parents can. But not you. This is not on you.", "What? no NTA. And if your grandparents are on team \"you should pay for your sister's cruise,\" then I'd say skip it altogether.", "NTA\n\nDon't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\n\n\"I am not responsible for my sister nor am I responsible for funding her. She has made choices that unfortunately have consequences for her. I am doing my best to pay for all my bills but do not have the ability to support another adult. \"", "\"My parents said without reliable transportation, she's been unable to maintain a steady income and it's my fault for moving away\"\n\nYour parents are delusional and should be put on block for the above statement alone. Their Child is not Your responsibility. \n\nPeople who send hate messages can chip in for her ticket. I personally would die on this hill. \n\nYour parents do not control the booking for the cruise line so they have no grounds to tell anybody they cannot go. You are an adult and no longer have to give any shits about their opinions.  \n\nNTA\n\nDo well in school and go on the cruise if it is something you will enjoy. If it sounds like more stress than fun, give a skip and block all the flying monkeys until you have your degree in hand.  School is where you should be focusing right now, not on your sister and parents shit choices in their lives.", "NTA.  Your sister is only a year older than you. She\u2019s a damn adult and can fund her own things. You aren\u2019t her babysitter, chauffeur, parent, tutor or bail bonds person and it\u2019s wrong of your parents to imply you have to. If your grandparents don\u2019t understand why you, a 19 yo college student, doesn\u2019t want to be in charge of your sister, I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA. Don't go. If you pay for her ticket you'll also be responsible for her bar bill.", "Amazing how everyone else is insisting that you pay for your sister, but aren't willing to pony up themselves.\n\nLet them know that one more demand like that and *you* won't go. Explain how it's unfathomable to you how they think that being forced to be the guardian and parent of your older sister, all while putting your life on hold, isn't sacrifice enough, especially when your own parents refused to do it.\n\nNTA but quit protecting your parents.", "NTA. Your parents decided to birth your sister. Not you. You\u2019ve already gone above and beyond. All the adults can equally chip in $ for your sister, but should know she will never take responsibility or improve if she keeps getting catered to by you and others. If not don\u2019t go and get on with your own life.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister is in the US and is on probation for her DUI she likely needs to get approval from her probation officer before she can leave the state. \n\nAs to you paying her way on the cruise?   Nope. \n\nYour parents ruined enough of your life already by not actually being parents - they don\u2019t get to dump their crappy decisions on you.  It is their choice to not pay for your sister and instead pay for a bunch of others to go.  \n\nAnd sadly if your grandparents want your sister to go then they should jump your bio parents to make it happen or they can pay for her. \n\nOr all those other relatives who are criticizing you can each chip in enough themselves to cover your sister\u2019s expenses for the trip.  \n\nI realize this is hard but part of being a good adult is not allowing others to make their problems yours to solve.  Your parents made this mess / they can own it.", "NTA, your parents can foot the bill if it's that important.  Tell everyone you can't afford to pay for her and stick to that story.", "NTA any family members saying to do it tell them to do it and block them. If you can't afford it at the moment don't waste your money. Plan something privately to celebrate with your grandparents.", "Uhm. How are you going to miss a whole week of college classes?  Are you sure that you can even go? NTA. \n\nIf you can\u2019t go, there\u2019s no way anyone would expect you to pay for your sister, right? Right??", "NTA Your entire family including the \"Let's call for a cruise to celebrate ourselves and dictate who has to shell out\" grandparents are assholes down to their toenails. They do realize they can't actually stop you from showing up if it is a public cruise, right? That would be freaking hilarious. On the same cruise and don't speak to any of them.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why the grandparents aren\u2019t paying for EVERYONE if they want people to come. If they can\u2019t afford it, find a cheaper option to celebrate together or just go by themselves.", "NTA!!", "My new favorite expression is: \"Go fund me, of fuck off.\"", "F that! Your sister needs rehab, not a cruise! This is just another case of enabling.", "Sounds like you need a new family.", "NTA. Don't go. Stay home and skip this hell scape. You will be forced to care take your sister or children the entire time. You don't owe your parents or you sister anything.", "If she does the parents will expect op to babysit the sister and the nieces while everyone else has fun.", "NTA. And this is the MAIN. She will withdraw on the cruise, and it will be miserable.-for you, because you will be tasked with taking care of her. Best bet-she go to rehab whilst you are gone. She can get started , and no one will be there to rescue her, which is good.\n\nYour parents are TA. I am sorry for you.", "It's interesting how OP's sister \"inability to keep a job\" is OP's fault because they moved away, but the parents weren't able to step up and drive her everywhere she needed to go.", "Perfect! It also prevents harassment from the parents during the cruise for failure to pay.", "Totally agree. Op should not go and should not pay for sister.", ">I'd find a time that works for me and my grandparents and go spend a week with them, just them and me.\n\nOr don't because they want OP to pay for sister too", "> I don't think I'm being unreasonable, but with my grandparents are calling me begging me to go on the cruise and to just go ahead and pay for my sister, I'm waivering.\n\nSounds like grandparents know and are ok with OP being treated that way...", "OP mentioned in the post that her parents said that if she doesn\u2019t pay for her sister then she isn\u2019t allowed to go.\n\nWhat power for they have in this situation to decide that?\n\nNTA", "THANK YOU.", "Agree with this completely.", "Why the hell are they paying for the grown 24 & 28 year old stepsisters & not the younger ones - one in college & one who\u2019s an addict with not much income?! Its all so weird. Seem like type of people that treat other people better than their own children to look good \ud83d\ude44", "I wouldn't bother going at all, they will guilt trip you, literally, the whole time and you won't enjoy it anyway", "Yeah, I was thinking OPs best options are to not go at all or to take a different cruise by herself!", "At least one of OP's absolute trash parents had to have learned their behavior somewhere, so can totally believe her Grandparents having the audacity to pull a self aggrandizing stunt like this.", "Screw that. Grandparents are enabling the shitty behavior and also think OP should pay for her sister. They're just as bad as her parents expecting everyone to pay their own way to a lavish event just so they can have everyone in an isolated location to honor them. The egos of this family.", "What on earth do you mean, N A H (No Assholes Here)??\n\n*Of course* there are assholes here: pretty much *everyone* except OP is an asshole.", "Yeah and cruises are not a great place for a sober person to be. So much drinking and partying go on. You do not need this kind of responsibility or stress in your life. Tell your grandparents to hang out with them for a week and pay to go somewhere nice for dinner to celebrate. But no paying for your sister! She is a big girl and she needs to put on her big girl panties and get her shit together!", "This is another good point and a good reason to celebrate alone with the grandparents.", "Also, a cruise ship is NOT a place to bring a shakily recovering alcoholic. There are bars everywhere, and she might need minding 24/7 not to fall overboard (and no I'm not kidding).\n\nSource: Been on dozens of cruises.", "Unlimited drinks?", "spot on!  You don\u2019t take an addict on a cruise unless they can pass multiple drug tests proving she has been and is currently clean.  And if she fails\u2026parents can send her to rehab or stay home with her.  Bless him for trying so hard, and for then getting the focus (rightly) on hImself!\n\nConfused about grandparents though, do they support the idea he should be responsible? that is wicked!  (And why don\u2019t they pay for her if they want to keep the peace?)", "I would upvote this 1000x if I could", "And OP is only 19!", "Parents didn\u2019t get that way out of nowhere.", "That wasn\u2019t there when I read it.  WOW. The grands suck too.", ">OP mentioned in the post that her parents said that if she doesn\u2019t pay for her sister then she isn\u2019t allowed to go.\n\nGood, that's a perfect reason to skip the cruise, her parents are the major AH's here...", "She literally said it was about image so yeah to look good and \u201cfunctional\u201d", "Very good point", "Bars that, depending on the line, you don't even have to get your card or anything out. Princess, for example, has proximity sensors that pick up on your room access medallion as you approach a bar. System knows if you've prepaid alcohol, if you're 21, etc. and charges your order directly to your room. \n\nVery easy to lure sis into thinking she can sneak a drink or two and nobody will notice, since a rum and coke looks identical to a coke... And there's no receipt.", "Parents have been glossing over what is actually going on. Prolly telling them sister likes to drink.", "I mean, I see it as a perfect reason to tell them to go fuck themselves and go anyway. To each their own I guess, haha.", "And the grandparents! \u201cWe waaaaant you to come so just pay for her so you can come\u201d guilt trip going on.", "And walk around in t-shirts that say snarky things like \"I'm not the parent,\" \"FAFO,\" \"0 Fs to give,\" \"Hugs not drugs,\" \"it's my world and you only live in it.\" But I'm a jerk."]}
