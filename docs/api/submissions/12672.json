I think it would be worth communicating that second part to him (and your mom if she's on you for it). Perhaps he would be willing to change his behavior and not spoil the game for you in the future so that you're more willing to let him play your games.", "NTA, but you need to make it clear the reason is because you have set boundaries regarding spoilers that he has completely disregarded in the past, and that trying to make you feel bad about playing a game the way you enjoy certainly doesn't help. Maybe you can make it work in the future, but for this time around that will not be happening. Essentially, he needs to understand that he has brought about the consequences by disregarding your feelings and even going so far as to purposely negatively affect them", "NTA\n\nYour game. YOU paid for it.", "Originally was thinking y t a but I've actually been in almost this exact situation and having your game spoiled and ridicule of how you play can really mess up the experience. For me the game was Silent Hill 3. Not like you said he could never play it. NAH", "Hmm I'd say in this case maybe don't limit it untill you beat the game I play alone and with my dad on games I buy all the time but I'm never like no I wanna beat it first. Try playing together (I loved the time I spent just hanging with my brother and watching him play resident evil) or if nothing else just have him agree to not spoil anything if he gets farther than you.\nP.s. unless he's insufferable try to get along with your brother when you get older you don't wanna drift apart, family is all you got.\nTldr? FAMILY", "The fact that you have liked this entertainment property longer than your brother is irrelevant. \n\nThe fact that you bought it with your own money might be - I\u2019m assuming you bought the PlayStation and any subscriptions associated it, and pay for at least the share of the Internet and electricity it requires. If these are all true, then it\u2019s your PlayStation and your game by most conventional rules, and you might be allowed to set your boundary. \n\nBut since you didn\u2019t seem disturbed by your brother playing the PlayStation, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not true. I think that you bought a video game with your own money, and think that gives you the exclusive right to say who can play it and when on the communal machine you installed it on. It does not. \n\nYTA \n\nYou can insist that he play using a different account, so that his progress and yours is tracked differently.

Then lock up your games.", "NTA, i read through some of the comments and i saw the one about you saying you grew up as \"the glass child\" and it made me totally understand. Your brother should have asked first, but the fact that your mother jumps to shout at you immediately because your brother told her something breaks my heart. \n\nperhaps in the foreseeable future your brother will begin to listen to your feelings and stop judging how you enjoy YOUR games and stop spoiling YOUR games, and if he doesnt, considering you stated in a comment the PlayStation is yours and so are most of the games he plays on it, lock him out until he gives you a GENUINE apology.\n\nUntil then, do not back down, not even when it comes to playing Part II. I have played TLOU several times over and i am in love with the game, the graphics, the story, the characters, the scenery, its all beautiful, trust me.\n\nIf theres any game in the world you dont want your brother to ruin, its The Last of Us, the game is so worth every penny.\n\nIm so glad your stepfamily understood, even though its heartbreaking that your biological family couldnt. Either way, best of luck OP, and enjoy TLOU!", "It\u2019s the mandalorian and he\u2019s running away from a mushroom.  Baby yoda transformed into a teenage girl.  \n\nI\u2019d say NTA considering you bought it but in this particular situation him playing it really doesn\u2019t ruin anything for you.

It is his he gets to say whatever he wants with it", "this comment has made me tear up. thankyou so much for your kind words, ive been feeling really selfish for what i did and i feel so bad, usually reddit AITA's are ruthless but the MAJORITY of comments on this one have been nothing but kind.", "aaa please dont, im really not wanting spoilers im so sorry :(", "considering im speaking of The Last of Us which shortens to TLOU (known by basically everyone who knows the franchise) i presumed that would be understood.", "I wouldn't rely on your mum to solve this for you, I think the commenter just meant to help her understand.\n\nNTA - but I'd encourage you to think about how to clearly set and maintain this boundary better going forwards, without resorting to extreme rigidity or applying 'revenge' to your thinking.\n\nSetting boundaries is tough - but it's an incredibly useful life skill, and family are often the hardest to do it with. Learning to set clear boundaries and communicate them effectively without pettiness, retaliation or frustration will set you up in really good stead for having positive relationships across the board.

And you are siblings after all, he will piss you off over and over lol, the key is communicating honestly and compassionatly when things like this come up", "And the TV too, I assume. It\u2019s interesting that I assumed you were a minor child, still living with your parents and thus incapable of owning anything, and not expected to pay your way through life. I suppose I inferred that from your tone, which I read as entitled. In any case, if this is your apartment / house that your brother is living in rent-free, then you\u2019re totally right - you make the rules, and if your brother doesn\u2019t like it, he can move out. \n\nOtherwise - in most communal family homes, if the PlayStation isn\u2019t in your private living space (I.e. it\u2019s in the common room), using only your private resources, then it\u2019s a shared device, and others in the household can use it. \n\nThere seems to be an asymmetry in how you regard communal resources other people procure, and communal resources you pay for yourself. I wonder why that is.", "If I live in my parents\u2019 house, and I buy a video game system that I connect to the tv they purchased, and I power it with power they purchase, is it reasonable for me to say \u201cyour contributions don\u2019t matter! You pay for the home, the power, the TV, but the PlayStation is mine. You can\u2019t use it\u201d?  \n\nIf that\u2019s okay, then wouldn\u2019t almost any parent, seeking to teach their child about family and reality, counter with \u201csure. That\u2019s fine.

And you now owe me rent\u201d?", "i dont want to rely on my mum, shes probably the worst to rely on when it comes to sorting my brother, the relationship with my bloodline family was always that where i was the glass child. my mother is always and always will be on my brothers side regardless.", "PS4", "yes, siblings will be siblings. \n\ni dont mind him playing things i have bought, i really\ndont, i do feel bad but i have to draw the line at certain things im really passionate about, as soon as i finish part I itll be opened up to the world while i play part II, and maybe if something gets worked out, my brother can play part II at the same time.", "the playstation belongs to me. i am not a minor, i am 22 and my brother is 25. we both still live with our parents and stepsiblings. the TV used does not belong to me and the room is used as a study for my stepfather. i dont mind people using the playstation, i bought it for the purpose that everyone can use it. however, the games i buy are bought for my use, unless explicitly said otherwise by me.\n\nthe way you speak about the situation is strange especially considering you know only the information provided. so if you dont mind, the things you are asking about are quite frankly none of your business.\n\ntheres no need to undermine people for your own personal benefit.", "This is a jump...", "https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-put-a-password-on-ps4\n\nYou can on the PS4 too"]}
