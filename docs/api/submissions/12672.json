Perhaps he would be willing to change his behavior and not spoil the game for you in the future so that you're more willing to let him play your games.", "NTA, but you need to make it clear the reason is because you have set boundaries regarding spoilers that he has completely disregarded in the past, and that trying to make you feel bad about playing a game the way you enjoy certainly doesn't help. Maybe you can make it work in the future, but for this time around that will not be happening. Essentially, he needs to understand that he has brought about the consequences by disregarding your feelings and even going so far as to purposely negatively affect them", "NTA\n\nYour game. YOU paid for it.", "Originally was thinking y t a but I've actually been in almost this exact situation and having your game spoiled and ridicule of how you play can really mess up the experience.

FAMILY", "The fact that you have liked this entertainment property longer than your brother is irrelevant. \n\nThe fact that you bought it with your own money might be - I\u2019m assuming you bought the PlayStation and any subscriptions associated it, and pay for at least the share of the Internet and electricity it requires. If these are all true, then it\u2019s your PlayStation and your game by most conventional rules, and you might be allowed to set your boundary. \n\nBut since you didn\u2019t seem disturbed by your brother playing the PlayStation, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not true.

Your brother should have asked first, but the fact that your mother jumps to shout at you immediately because your brother told her something breaks my heart. \n\nperhaps in the foreseeable future your brother will begin to listen to your feelings and stop judging how you enjoy YOUR games and stop spoiling YOUR games, and if he doesnt, considering you stated in a comment the PlayStation is yours and so are most of the games he plays on it, lock him out until he gives you a GENUINE apology.\n\nUntil then, do not back down, not even when it comes to playing Part II. I have played TLOU several times over and i am in love with the game, the graphics, the story, the characters, the scenery, its all beautiful, trust me.\n\nIf theres any game in the world you dont want your brother to ruin, its The Last of Us, the game is so worth every penny.\n\nIm so glad your stepfamily understood, even though its heartbreaking that your biological family couldnt.

Learning to set clear boundaries and communicate them effectively without pettiness, retaliation or frustration will set you up in really good stead for having positive relationships across the board.

It\u2019s interesting that I assumed you were a minor child, still living with your parents and thus incapable of owning anything, and not expected to pay your way through life. I suppose I inferred that from your tone, which I read as entitled. In any case, if this is your apartment / house that your brother is living in rent-free, then you\u2019re totally right - you make the rules, and if your brother doesn\u2019t like it, he can move out. \n\nOtherwise - in most communal family homes, if the PlayStation isn\u2019t in your private living space (I.e. it\u2019s in the common room), using only your private resources, then it\u2019s a shared device, and others in the household can use it. \n\nThere seems to be an asymmetry in how you regard communal resources other people procure, and communal resources you pay for yourself. I wonder why that is.", "If I live in my parents\u2019 house, and I buy a video game system that I connect to the tv they purchased, and I power it with power they purchase, is it reasonable for me to say \u201cyour contributions don\u2019t matter! You pay for the home, the power, the TV, but the PlayStation is mine. You can\u2019t use it\u201d?  \n\nIf that\u2019s okay, then wouldn\u2019t almost any parent, seeking to teach their child about family and reality, counter with \u201csure. That\u2019s fine.

And you now owe me rent\u201d?", "i dont want to rely on my mum, shes probably the worst to rely on when it comes to sorting my brother, the relationship with my bloodline family was always that where i was the glass child. my mother is always and always will be on my brothers side regardless.", "PS4", "yes, siblings will be siblings. \n\ni dont mind him playing things i have bought, i really\ndont, i do feel bad but i have to draw the line at certain things im really passionate about, as soon as i finish part I itll be opened up to the world while i play part II, and maybe if something gets worked out, my brother can play part II at the same time.", "the playstation belongs to me. i am not a minor, i am 22 and my brother is 25. we both still live with our parents and stepsiblings. the TV used does not belong to me and the room is used as a study for my stepfather. i dont mind people using the playstation, i bought it for the purpose that everyone can use it. however, the games i buy are bought for my use, unless explicitly said otherwise by me.\n\nthe way you speak about the situation is strange especially considering you know only the information provided. so if you dont mind, the things you are asking about are quite frankly none of your business.\n\ntheres no need to undermine people for your own personal benefit.", "This is a jump...", "https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-put-a-password-on-ps4\n\nYou can on the PS4 too", "my oldest does the same.

When I was younger and I bought a game, my younger bro asked me if he could play after I do. I\u2019d play for a couple hours then he could on his profile.

My read is that you\u2019re struggling with communal ownership, or an emergent property of it (in this case, your brother spoiling the plot of the video game). Your solution is \u201cthis is mine, you can\u2019t use it until I\u2019m done\u201d, which seems troubling to me because it\u2019s unenforceable (unless you\u2019ve got a disc system and you hold the disc) and because it seems selfish (\u201cyou can\u2019t play this video game that I own despite the fact that we\u2019re in a communal family and it costs me nothing, in any conceivable way, except the value I derive from denying you the experience, which I prioritize over your enjoyment\u201d). That second piece seems to be where our disconnect lies. I think that\u2019s your position, and I think that it\u2019s selfish enough to rate you an AH. But I\u2019m very open to feedback. Am I misunderstanding your position? Or do you and I just disagree about whether that position is morally defensible (perhaps as a result of different standards of sharing in a communal / family living situation)?", "Could you elaborate about where the jump is?", "which is exactly what i did. i, me, myself bought the DISC for The Last of Us Part I and Part II, and do not want my brother to play it on the playstation that I payed for, using the internet/electricity that I pay a chunk for. he pays nothing towards the playstation, the internet, the electricity or the games he plays, I pay for it all. So even though the playstation may not be in my own private domain, i feel i have the right to tell him he has to wait a bit to prevent him taking away from my experience which if i havent made it clear enough to you i have PAYED FOR. but im unsure hence im asking reddit, AITA? even though i feel im not, there's uncertainty. have you been given enough of my personal information to be fully satisfied now?? there have been multiple occasions in the past that I have FULLY PAYED for something that my brother has then claimed full ownership of to friends/family, he ruins experiences, so yes, im going to pull the selfish little glass sister card and \"prioritize over his enjoyment\" he's had enough of ridiculing me in the past, im simply preventing him from doing it again, is that such a bad thing to want to protect my feelings about something im passionate about? either way, this post is solely to get the opinion of redditors, most of which have said im NTA, however, and opinion is an opinion and should you believe I am the a-hole that is your decision to make, afterall thats why this post is up. what i dont need is you to be hugely obsessing over the \"commune ownership\" when i have made it clear i own practically everything connected to the game disc i purchased and am preventing my brother from playing until I am finished or at least a while into. you have made your statement clear, you do not need to back it up with the same point in a different form over and over again.\n\n\nim simply asking whether you feel im the a-hole or not, i dont need you to tell me you found my tone entitled, or tell me you percieved me as a minor because of the way i type, you didnt even need to know i still live with my parents. its a simple question, whether you think my actions make me an asshole or not."]}
