Firstly, I\u2019ve had a tumultuous relationship with my step sister (also 18f) who has done some bewildering things.\n\nShe has put bleach on my favourite clothes \u201caccidentally\u201d, put my step brothers (19m) lube in my room and told them that i was being weird. She has told her brother that \u201cI liked him a bit too much\u201d, she put her panties in my room, burnt my favourite antique book, tried to put pink dye in my conditioner and ruined all of my film in my cameras.\n\nI have told my step mother and my father about this which they have discussed with her but she just calls me delusional and a \u201cliar\u201d. They let her off the hook and it happens on repeat. \n\nRecently, my sister started to offer cooking our meals when she has never cooked for us before. Suspiciously, I have chosen to not eat her food and when everyone asks me why, I just say I\u2019m not hungry even though she seems pissed. This may sound crazy but I think she is capable of doing something to my food, to try to make me \u201csick\u201d.\n\nNow, that I\u2019ve been doing it many times, my father has told me to stop being hostile and to get a plate. I told him the same thing and didn\u2019t eat it. But, he pulled me aside and told me I was making our relationship hostile with her kids. He said that I should be the \u201ccivil one\u201d.\n\n\nAITA for still denying to eat her food?", "created_utc": 1669268514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3blua/aita_for_never_eating_my_step_sisters_food/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YOU are his child, not the grown ass adult that's behaving like a territorial 10 year old. \n\nCan you live with your mom or another family member?", "Uh, NTA, but you either need to get some sort of security cameras or find someone to take you in. Your dad is failing you. Is there another relative or friend you can stay with?", "NTA.  She is absolutely planning to tamper with your food, and your Dad is probably scolding you because she's been crying crocodile tears to her Mom and him about you not eating the food.  Do not eat anything she's been able to mess with, and if there are other family members you could live with, please reach out to them to ask--this isn't a safe place for you, and clearly your Dad and stepmom aren't interested in taking any action to protect you.", "NTA.  She sounds like she's building up to something bigger.  And calling you delusional and a liar is her gaslighting you. \n\nDo you have any other family members you can stay with?", "NTA\n\nNext time someone challenges you after she serves food, challenge them to switch plates with the one she made for you.\n\nIf you think she may have given up messing with your plate after all the refusals, and just enjoys playing the victim while you refuse to eat this may not work.  You could always try eating once and challenging your dad to switch the next time.", "NTA. I\u2019d be very wary of this too. \n\nIf you\u2019re forced to put up with this situation, can you be sure she is not plating your food and that everyone fills up their own plate from the pot/dish? Buffet style is the only way I would trust my food wasn\u2019t tampered with. And if she DID do something, everyone else would be affected too and might finally do something about her shenanigans.", "NTA. You have good reason to be suspicious. If your dad and/or stepmom say something again, ask to switch plates with them (assuming you all get the same meals& portion sizes) and see what happens.", "NTA, You should move out asap if you can, maybe get a lock for your door? You're right not to trust her or food she cooks for you.", "NTA - Can you not live with your moms family? Your dad is TA and is enabling her with his shit wife", "NTA\n\nYour family needs therapy. You've expressed concerns about her behavior and they were swept under the rug, of course you don't feel safe eating her food!", "NTA. Not by a long shot. Hold your ground but if you want to throw a \"civil\" bone at the family, tell them you'll eat what she makes IF you get to make your own plate/bowl up. When they complain point out that if there is nothing to worry about there should be no problem with you serving yourself AND one of the adults can watch you do  it.  If they say no then make yourself something to eat and if you can start reaching out to your more sane relatives if you have any about living with them.\n\nWhen you do finally move out make sure you get EVERYTHING and honestly have a friend come over to play guard dog in your room to keep your step sister from messing with things.", "NTA better safe than sorry.", "NTA\n\nI would be very suspicious with her too!  Watch your back! She sounds like a Disney villain. LoL. \n\nCould you ask for a lock on your door, if you don\u2019t already?

However, I wouldn't be surprised if dad reacts the same way as the husband of the woman whose MIL was poisoning her - he knew, and was furious she wouldn't just go along and get poisoned. Your dad is more than aware of how your stepsister is treating you, only he is furious that you won't be a quiet victim. Keep on taking care of yourself, and get out of that abusive situation as soon as you can. Good luck.", "NTA.  This person has given you reason to be suspicious so you need to look after yourself.", "Nope.  She's a loon.  Don't trust her.  NTA", "NTA.  A. You don't trust her because she's given you reasons not to trust her.  Whatever the circumstances are between you -we only know one side- the fact is that not eating her food is probably smart.  You don't eat food made by people who have otherwise antagonized you.  Roman emperors knew that.\n\nB. Taking the high road, being the 'civil one,' means not contributing to the nonsense.  It doesn't mean assuming everything is okay when she has made it clear that things are not okay.\n\nC. Hopefully you're working on getting out of that situation.  By your description the girl is one dumb trick away from getting you a night in jail, if not worse.", "NTA\n\nIt's a pity your own father doesn't believe you. Try to gather some proof. Maybe buy yourself a small camera, hide it in the room, and leave recording on.\n\nYou're smart not to eat the food she cooks. She will put something in your food when you're not looking, and then make fun of you the next day. Your family will never believe it was her, because they all eat the same food. \n\nYou need outside help. Is there anyone you can go to? Grandparents? Aunt/Uncle? School counselor?\n\nYou need an adult on your side, this is a hard battle to fight alone.", "NTA\n\nGET OUT OF THAT HOUSE ASAP", "Take some food from the plate she gives you as a sample and have it tested.

It's not hostile behaviour, it's defensive. You wouldn't put your hand in a bears mouth, would you?", "Have you thought about getting a nanny cam for you room?

You ARE being civil. You have always been civil.
