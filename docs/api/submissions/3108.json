Firstly, I\u2019ve had a tumultuous relationship with my step sister (also 18f) who has done some bewildering things.\n\nShe has put bleach on my favourite clothes \u201caccidentally\u201d, put my step brothers (19m) lube in my room and told them that i was being weird. She has told her brother that \u201cI liked him a bit too much\u201d, she put her panties in my room, burnt my favourite antique book, tried to put pink dye in my conditioner and ruined all of my film in my cameras.\n\nI have told my step mother and my father about this which they have discussed with her but she just calls me delusional and a \u201cliar\u201d. They let her off the hook and it happens on repeat. \n\nRecently, my sister started to offer cooking our meals when she has never cooked for us before. Suspiciously, I have chosen to not eat her food and when everyone asks me why, I just say I\u2019m not hungry even though she seems pissed. This may sound crazy but I think she is capable of doing something to my food, to try to make me \u201csick\u201d.\n\nNow, that I\u2019ve been doing it many times, my father has told me to stop being hostile and to get a plate. I told him the same thing and didn\u2019t eat it. But, he pulled me aside and told me I was making our relationship hostile with her kids.

You need to find somewhere to go. She'll continue to be abusive if her actions are not addressed soon. Future relationships with family, friends, possibly even her children whenever she has them, will all be effected. If you have friends or family that you can stay with, I suggest staying with them until an agreement can be made. Your parents don't understand or care about the severity of the situation or the stress it puts on you. Honestly, you should be prepared for your father and step mom to take her side too.

I read this sub for a laugh most days, but this genuinely disturbed me. Your fear is rational. You wouldn\u2019t feel that way if you didn\u2019t have very good reason to. It\u2019s not normal to actively avoid food when hungry; your intuition is telling you that something is wrong.\n\nThis is very dangerous.
