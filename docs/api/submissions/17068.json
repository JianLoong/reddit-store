She asked me to switch parking spots because she gets too tired walking up to the building from her parking spot which is far. I told her no, because then I would have to walk that distance and I don't want to. She told me I am perfectly able to walk that distance and I told her yeah, but I don't want to, ask someone else.

She told me the other people who have parking spots near the entrance are some elderly coworkers. I told her it sucks but I won't change.

Doctors don\u2019t just hand those out like candy lol", "LOL, thanks for the much needed laugh in this boring day, if I had an award it would definetly go to you.", "Damn I thought people from there where nice, ALSO YTA", "It's nice for a change to see that obnoxious, entitled AH's are everywhere, not just the USA.", "YTA", "Only because of nepotism.", "She\u2019s not lazy, she\u2019s pregnant and experiencing mobility issues because of it. She is temporarily disabled and is entitled to reasonable accommodations because of it.\n\nShe came to you as a person to ask you to do a nice thing and you refused. When she returns with a doctors note to force the issue she\u2019s still gonna get a closer parking spot and everyone at the office will see you as an unkind nepotism hire.", "And it\u2019s also not difficult to be a nice person and walk a bit further when you\u2019re completely healthy and your coworker has a temporary disability.", "They\u2019re giving you context for why you suck, which is what the sub is for.", "YTA", "Yeah and the overwhelming answer is you are an asshole, but you wanna keep trying to justify it. You are allowed to keep the spot, and we are allowed to call you an asshole for it", "u/Smiley-Canadian was trying to find any semblance of sympathy within you by bringing up complications of being pregnant. And you're saying you don't care what happens to this woman and refusing to learn how difficult it is for her. And it's all because you don't want to give up a parking spot which means nothing to you except \"I don't wanna walk a longer distance for a few months\". While to her, it means a safer pregnancy.\n\nYou have proven by refusing to accept judgment from not just your co-workers but over 300 redditors who say YTA and you're getting defensive.\n\nThat's why I asked \"why are you here\". Because you don't seem to care about anyone but yourself and refused to learn your mistake and become a better and caring person", "She's not disabled, otherwise she would get a license to park in the handicap parking, but she doesn't do that because she doesn't have any disability", "Dude did you want other peoples opinions or did you want to just be told you\u2019re right screw the pregnant woman? You\u2019re responses are beyond pathetic. You\u2019ve obviously never had to life a finger for anything yourself your entire life.", "If her doctor gave her a handicap pass (my SO could have gotten one when pregnant) would you concede the spot then?", "\ud83d\ude44", "No, it wouldn't be necessary because there's handicap spots right next to mine, she would get to use those"]}
