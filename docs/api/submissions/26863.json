To make a long story short, my father freaked out and completely cut me off when I started transitioning in my teens. I was very upset at him for a long time, but I've always wanted a relationship with him. When he reached out to me, I was especially happy to hear him apologize about specific things he said to me, so I want to clarify, I really want to make this work. It's part of why I invited him to his birthday.\n\nMy father has a tattoo on his arm of a bound and gagged woman. I'm not a prude, but he wore a muscle shirt to the birthday party and it was fully visible. I've never seen him wear a muscle shirt since we reconnected, I didn't think that he'd show it at all. My boyfriend and I had the same reaction to it. We both agreed it was totally inappropriate for a party for a seven-year-old! \n\nHe brought a jean jacket, so I asked him if he could just keep it on. He said it was too hot for him to wear it inside, and he told me it's just artistic nudity. To me, it's not just a naked figure, which is fine, but it's sexual because she's bound and gagged. He said there's no sex act taking place and no visible genitalia (just bare breasts), and basically said \"he'll live.\" Then he made this joke saying maybe I would've turned out differently if he had this tattoo when I was growing up. It was definitely a joke, and I actually don't mind jokes about how non-masculine I am or how I'm not attracted to women because they're both true and I can take a good joke at my expense. What annoyed me is that I was trying to express how I felt and he went into comedian mode. \n\nI realized I wasn't getting anywhere with him, so I told my boyfriend that, and my boyfriend approached him. This really bothered my father, and he said that if I wouldn't stick up for him, he'd leave. I told him that all he has to do is put on a jacket and it doesn't have to be a big deal. He left. \n\nMy father hasn't responded to any of my attempts to talk with him since. I've been really second-guessing how I approached this. I really don't have a problem with artistic nudity. If it was the Birth of Venus tattooed to him, I wouldn't care, it's the sexual part. My mom agreed that it was completely inappropriate, but I asked one of my friends who's into BDSM, and she said that kink isn't necessarily sexual and my \"over-the-top\" response is prejudice against people who practice BDSM. She said that my boyfriend and I were definitely influenced by subconscious bias as a pretty vanilla couple, and she said she agreed with what my dad said about no genitalia or sex act occurring in the tattoo. \n\nWhat makes me feel the most like an asshole is that I want him in my life. I've been telling him that. And now he's pulled away even more, and my actions are what led to that. It's really been weighing on me, and I'd appreciate any responses.

He can wear a bandage over it.", "Your friend is an idiot.\n\nIt\u2019s not kink shaming to say that a parent has the right to prohibit someone from displaying their animated bondage themed nudity - no matter how artistic.", "NTA. Please do not feel like this is your fault. Your father was being a bad role model and jerk. If you want to fix the relationship I\u2019m sure you can. Don\u2019t let him make you feel bad", "NTA. Definitely not appropriate for a 7yo's birthday party. Also - even if the general view was that the tattoo was fine, you are still allowed to set boundaries at a child's party that you are hosting.", "NTA. \n\nComing from someone with tattoos, getting a tattoo in a visible place with a design that can be interpreted as offensive (basically anything sexual or political) is gonna have consequences. One of those consequences might be being asked to cover it up at a child's birthday party.\n\nHow on earth does your dad function in the real world?", "NTA I love artistic nudity, but no child should see a tattoo of a bound and gagged woman on their birthday.\n\nThat's messed up. Your friend is going off about an issue that isn't present. You're not judging your dad or anyone for having the tattoo, you're judging him for presenting it at a seven year old's birthday party.\n\nBDSM is valid in teenager to adult spaces, but it shouldn't be displayed in front of children.", "NTA. Even if some people argue that the tattoo is 'not sexual', the way your father disrespected you is enough reason to not stick up for him. I really get wanting a relationship with a difficult parent. And Im not saying you shouldn't, but for your own protection and that of your family, please think about what it would be like to have these situations more often. Because I think we both know this was not a one time thing.\n\nEdit: Spelling.", "NTA. I don't think any kid just seeing the tattoo is really a problem.  However... I'd be concerned about his response if a kid asked him what it was (instead of asking their parents, you, etc.).\n\nIn any case, he's making this a far bigger deal than it should be.", "NTA. Listen, I'm a kinkster and I'm 100% down for nonsexual kink. But kinksters are not an oppressed minority and we all understand that most people think of kink as automatically sexual. We can try to change that perception, we can try to educate people, but what we're not gonna do is display an image of a bound, gagged, and nude or partly nude woman at a *child's birthday party* and expect people to see it as not sexual.", "Good grief, I'm in the kink community.  While she's not wrong that you probably have some subconscious bias about kink meaning only sex - your friends ARE wrong in saying it would be appropriate for a child.\n\nIn the community, a lot of thought goes into not scaring the normies.  We want people to view kink/leather how we see it, not through the lens of deviance.\n\nThat being said, we usually *are* a bunch of deviants.

NTA", "NTA. Most tattoos are a life-long mistake.  (bracing for incoming downvotes)\n\nDon't buy into your friend's relativistic apologetics and playing the reverse-uno \"no, u are prejudiced\" card. It's a completely inappropriate thing to bare in front of 7 year olds.", "NTA Showing that tattoo was literally an act of dominance. He\u2019s shown you what kind of person he is and keeping him away from your stepson best.

I feel like that\u2019s some context that could help put things into perspective. Either way, given that you didn\u2019t know about the tattoo beforehand and couldn\u2019t preemptively ask him to keep it covered and both you and your partner seemed to have an issue with it, I\u2019d say NTA", "Well, first, tattoos *are* an art form. He'll see plenty of breasts if you take him to an art museum, too. \n\nSecond, that kid is going to see tattoos like that on other people. He's going to overhear every bad word. In a few years, even if he doesn't have his own computer *someone he knows* who is more 'free range' will inevitably show him internet porn. If he's like me, he'll also be cheering along to every death in Alien and Aliens by ten. You just can't hide this stuff forever.\n\nI don't know if this is big enough to vote on. I mean, you were a bit of a jerk to your father given the absence of meaningful harm. But I suppose it is your BF's son and your sort-of-stepson.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHell,\n\nNAH\n\nBecause I really don't think he was wrong to balk at the request, nor do I think you were somehow out of place in making the request. Just a bit...     over cautious, I'd say.", "NTA bc kids aren't going to make the distinction, but I agree with you friend: this doesn't sound like a sexual tattoo.", "NTA. Being a stepparent means you are responsible, or at least partially responsible for the upbringing of the child. You tried to protect them from something you thought was inappropriate and you can't be judged an asshole for that.\n\nThat said, the smart thing to do in that situation would be just to let it go. Pointing it out and making a big deal over it is more likely to draw attention to it, rather than conceal it. If you had have just let it go, there wouldn't have been a \"mini drama\" at the party, your Dad could have stayed and had a good time, you wouldn't be stressing and worrying if you're an asshole and the kids would have had a fun time at their party and probably not even have noticed the tatoo at all.\n\nSometimes doing the right thing can cause more problems than doing nothing at all.", "NTA that's a disgusting tattoo and never needs to be on display, especially at a child's birthday party. He is the asshole here.", "YTA. Even suggesting someone should cover up a tatoo is asinine. If you are ashamed of your dad he shouldn't be there. He has nothing to feel embarrassed about, there is nothing wring with his tatoo.", "....she said that kink isn't necessarily sexual and my \"over-the-top\" response is prejudice against people who practice BDSM.
