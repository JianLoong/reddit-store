She was gonna meet me back at my apartment, maybe 5 minute walk from the bar we were at. I get home a couple minutes before she does and when she gets back, she knocks and then when I don\u2019t answer IMMEDIATELY she proceeds to go to my patio, break a glass bottle, and cut a massive slash in the screen door so she can get in. Mind you I opened the door for her before she even made it all the way to the patio. Anyways, I\u2019m pissed at her and tell her to leave immediately and go back to her place (also a 5 min walk from my place). She doesn\u2019t, so I call the police. Part of me hopes she\u2019ll leave just from me calling but she doesn\u2019t. She sticks around and when they show up, they tell her to either go back to her place or go to a friends, but she doesn\u2019t. She puts up an argument with them and ends up getting arrested for public intoxication. I really could not deal with her spending the night here for the sake of myself and my roommate, which is why I called in the first place. I\u2019m always cleaning up her messes here and her slashing the screen door was enough that she had to go home for the night. I told the officers that I really didn\u2019t want her to go to jail but I just wanted her to leave for the night, but she kept bickering with them and refused to leave which is why they took her to jail.

On paper she did everything wrong but she was not some stranger. Yes drunk people are accountable but if I want to a party with my partner I would expect them to look out for me to a degree. How drunk were you yourself?   \nIt would be a different story if it was a regular occurrence or if she knew she \"gets mental\" when drunk,etc. Now she is going to have a misdemeanor in her criminal history which dos not seem very proportional.", "Wow.
