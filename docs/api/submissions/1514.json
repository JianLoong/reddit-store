They're learning to walk, they're gonna fall. \n\nBut... if you MIL has mobility issues, then she can't really intervene in a timely way if the kid's in danger, and given kids can get themselves into trouble in a flash, it seems weird to leave the kid with her if she can't keep up, or if it's in a situation where she can't keep control of what the kid is up to. \n\nI don't think either of you are being entirely sensible here.", "Ah. Sounds like my spouse. Baby fell off the bed on my \u201cwatch\u201d and spouse was LIVID! Until\u2026.baby fell off the bed on spouse\u2019s watch. Didn\u2019t say squat to me again. \n\nIt happens. Babies get hurt and unless you Saran Wrap your whole house, stuff will happen. If he\u2019s unhappy with the way the baby is cared for, he can stay home and watch the baby 24/7.", "Your husband knows his mom better than you do, and if he says she shouldn\u2019t watch the baby alone, then please believe him so something worse doesn\u2019t happen to your child. However, he shouldn\u2019t expect you to have to do everything that you are doing. You need help, and your MIL doesn\u2019t count. As a matter of fact, she may need some elder care at this point. Good luck.", "NTA - your husband is though, why are you letting this man who is not home dictate how you parent? Do what feels right TO YOU.", "NTA\n\nYes kids that small have accidents.  When accidents are consistently happening with the same person, in a short amount of time unsupervised I can see why this is an issue.\n\n\nYou had your concerns and your husband prioritizes his mothers feelings and needs ahead of her limitations.  It's all fun and games till something bad happens. See he is telling you to take care of the baby better because he is mad that the baby is getting hurt on his mothers watch and he knows your right, but he would rather blame you, so he will do that in addition to yelling at his mom.  He like hates that he has to do this.\n\n\nI would honestly try to figure out if this is truly her inability to watch him or if it was an accident.  OR have MIL watch the baby near the kitchen where you can see what she is doing or showering during nap time.  \n\n\nI hope neither of them escalate.", "My daughter full on ran her head into the edge of our dinner table, tonight, in front of 3 adults (My wife, MIL, and I) who were sitting at the table when she did it. Kids do stupid shit and get bumps. As long as they're prevented from things like bouncing themselves down the stairs or drinking products from under the sink you're doing fine.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your husband asks you why, you can tell him that the last 3 days have been proof that his mom can\u2019t move fast enough to protect an active baby from getting hurt. \n\nTell him you want the baby to have a chance to bond with her grandmother but at a reduced risk of injury", "Well. I think maybe make a safe space where mil can take care of baby with no bumps. But nta", "I'm onboard with this opinion--who normally watches baby while you cook/do chores? NTA for baby bumps, YTA for making your hubs listen to you blame his geriatric Ma. How about placing a playpen in the kitchen or wherever you're doing chores?", "My husband is convinced that MIL can handle it so I trusted his judgment and gave it a shot. We have a safe space, a playpen, but MIL didn\u2019t use it with the baby. I\u2019ll enforce this in future to ensure baby is safe when with her.", "He would love to stay home and watch the baby 24/7, I think! But he earns way higher than I do and wants to retire early so he can spend more time with our daughter and not have to stress about money. I\u2019d like to work but we\u2019re currently living in a country wherein he\u2019s the only one allowed to work while I\u2019m not cause of visa restrictions.", "I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding, he thinks she can look after our daughter. Not the other way around.", "I think he should have a say because he\u2019s also our daughter\u2019s parent even if he\u2019s not home.", "There\u2019s a safe space. A playpen that can be closed. But they didn\u2019t go in there and I\u2019ve no idea why. I\u2019ll enforce it in the future so baby is safe when with her.", "I normally do when MIL isn\u2019t around. I just put the baby in playpen but I leave her with MIL so they can play when she\u2019s here so they get to spend time together.\n\nTo clarify, I didn\u2019t blame his mom. I didn\u2019t even get mad or annoyed at his mom. He picked the fight with me and then picked a fight with his mom because he was annoyed that baby kept getting hurt.\n\nEdit: I only pointed out that it didn\u2019t happen on my watch but his mom\u2019s watch because he kept blaming me and getting annoyed at me.", "'Having a say' is not the same as lecturing you/his mum for the baby getting a bump, his 'say' was that MIL gets time alone with baby.. so to then have a go at you for that? Absolutely no.", "My mil is also super old and slow. I make sure my girl is in a safe space when I leave her with her for minutes at a time lol", "It may be inconvenient to have your MIL around for an extended period, but make sure you\u2019re not setting her and your baby up for failure.\n\nIt sounds like you might be harboring resentment for a situation (extended stay) and you feel like you\u2019re voice is only heard when extreme situations develop.\n\nMy suggestion is find a group/family therapist\u2014someone YOU have personally vetted, and then bring your husband and MIL into the conversation.", "May I ask why it seems like I harbor resentment? Cause honestly, I don\u2019t but I am curious which bit might come across as that.", "I don\u2019t mean it in a cruel way, I just know how I would feel\u2026and you\u2019re being outnumbered by your hub and his mom. It\u2019s unfair."]}
