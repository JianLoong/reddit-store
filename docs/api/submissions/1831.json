{"id": 1831, "submission_id": "yppwkt", "title": "AITA for making my friends sister cry?", "selftext": "Please be nice lol. I was hanging out at my friend's (S) house last Saturday like usual. My friend's sister (E) is really weird. She'll just stare at me and when she realizes I notice she'll run off. I can't wear certain perfumes at their house because it's apparently too strong for E. \n\nOnce E took the strings out of my hoodie so she could play with them. Apparently she thought the hoodie was hers even though she's seen me wear it multiple times. I once put some of my pads in their bathroom and I found out later that E had thrown them all away. E has also walked in on me several times when I'm using the bathroom. S & E share a bathroom and their parents removed the lock after an incident with E. It's super creepy and I've told E to knock several times.\n\nWell this past Saturday E walked in on me again. The worst part was that she didn't leave right away. It was like she was a deer in headlights. I was so pissed y'all. I called her a creep and slammed the door shut. Just to be clear, I made sure the door wouldn't hit E before I shut it. Apparently this was very upsetting as she started having one of her famous meltdowns. \n\nTheir mom was quick to respond and I tried to explain my side of the story. E's mom wasn't having it and even after S came to my defense I was told I would have to leave. Their mom told my mom an unfavorable account of the events. Apparently I'm antagonistic to E and I won't be allowed back over for awhile. My mom agreed with their mom's response. So now I'm 2nd guessing everything I ever did to E and wondering if I overreacted. Also, E is 10 so she's not like some toddler who doesn't know better.\n\nEdit: I'm 15, S is 14, and E is on the spectrum", "created_utc": 1667922131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yppwkt/aita_for_making_my_friends_sister_cry/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is just creepy and it is the parents' fault. You did not make her cry. She cried because she was ashamed, which is the appropriate emotion after what she did.", "NTA. They need to put the lock back on if the child can't be taught to NOT walk in on someone. I'd be upset too.  Sorry not sorry to those who think being on the spectrum means she can do this and have no consequences.  She needs to be taught. And mom needs to not be dismissive.", "I knew E was on the spectrum before you said it. However just because she\u2019s autistic does not mean she should be allowed to intrude on you in the bathroom. Maybe you should have talked to the mom about it instead of calling her a creep. So NTA you just handled it wrong.", "NTA. My son is 11 and has Autism and so many comments about how your the AH just because of her neurodiversity set me off. If this was the first incident that would be a bit different, but not much. This is her repeated behavior and that is not okay. I get you don't understand her, but her parents are aware this is an ongoing issue. One of my main thoughts because of how she acts towards you is this something she only does to you or is this a behavior she does with everyone?", "NTA - it\u2019s probably better if you stay away from their house for awhile. Are you still allowed to be friends with S?", "NAH. I think a lot of people are overlooking how traumatic it can be to have anyone walk into the bathroom and stare at you. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s ND, it\u2019s still inappropriate and I can understand how that made you uncomfortable. I think you were harsh in the moment, but you aren\u2019t wrong to say the actions are creepy themselves. She isn\u2019t an AH for not understanding. I think the parents kinda suck for not having a solution to the bathroom problem, and your mom sucks for not hearing you out. It isn\u2019t unreasonable to not want to be exposed to someone else\u2019s kid.", "People are being weird about the words a 15 year old is using to describe someone who has repeatedly violated their privacy. I wouldn't expect a 15 year old to have the emotional maturity to express their feelings of unease in a different way, especially knowing that \"creepy\" is a common term used by people to describe others who overstep boundaries until well into their 20s.\n\nI'm going to go with NAH, because it doesn't sound like your friend's mom really even suspects there being ulterior motives for E's behavior, and you should be allowed to tell someone when they're being abusive, even if their situation might explain why--your boundaries are valid and concrete and no one else's situation has the ability to force you to accept transgressions. Can you invest in a travel doorstop? There are products you can use to keep the door from opening if you choose to go back over to their house, though it wouldn't be wrong for you to choose not to.", "Is there any way your friend can go to your house so you 2 can still have your Saturdays and not have to deal with E you're nta it's hard with kids like her for the parent and jumped into protective mode on her and that can blind them to actually stopping for a minute hear all stories before making a decision I hope you 2 can still have your friendship", "NTA. People voting otherwise must be tripping. You can\u2019t expect someone to walk on eggshells around someone because that person is ND. E is repeatedly violating OPs boundaries. OP is a 15 year old so I\u2019m not surprised the word \u201ccreep\u201d was thrown around. I\u2019m in my 20s and I use that word when someone repeatedly makes me uncomfortable. It\u2019s not name-calling, it\u2019s not ableist, it\u2019s not abusive. It\u2019s a high-adrenaline response to an uncomfortable situation which is valid here especially since it keeps happening. It\u2019s happened before, and seems like OP has tried talking directly to E to tell her to stop and it hasn\u2019t stopped. Next would be to bring it up to E\u2019s parents but based on how they reacted in this post, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been much help.\nThe actions of E\u2019s parents are actually going to hinder E in life down the line. Not sure how high functioning she is, but if she can\u2019t have a lock on the door/can\u2019t respect peoples boundaries then how is she supposed to function in the real world? Even if she needs to live with her parents, what if they have guests over? Is someone always going to have to stand guard over the bathroom door to make sure E doesn\u2019t open it? Right now it seems specific to OP but what if E has the same feelings towards another guest? The way E\u2019s parents are handling it just doesn\u2019t seem sustainable long term. E was \u201ca deer in headlights\u201d when she opened the bathroom door which would imply she understands she shouldn\u2019t walk in on someone using the bathroom. People who are ND can learn how to knock.\n\nOPs friend S also kind of sucks for not being more helpful but she\u2019s also 14 so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA  \n\n\nE is a problem and needs help.  She steals, she damages other people's property, and she cannot even give people the basic respect of privacy to take care of bodily functions.  Her mother is doing her no favors by coddling her and allowing this behavior, so I would think the best solution is to not put yourself in range of E's nonsense.  That could mean your BF hanging out at your house, or in neutral locations.", "Info\u2014\n\nHow old you are?

It\u2019s probably worth having a conversation with your friend and her mum about their younger sister.", "NTA", "NTA. But just stop going to their house. Why doesn't S want to come to yours instead? Do her parents not let her as they think E would feel left out?", "NTA does she have a crush on you because it seems like it and don't feel bad, what she did was actions a sex offender would do.

Are there more siblings for S and E? \n\nI think NTA, but it sounds like E has some issues maybe that no one has shared?

She is on the spectrum, she isn\u2019t a \u201ccreep\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d. I understand you are only 15, but you clearly have access to the internet, research autism and how an individual with autism may struggle to understand social situations. Or talk to E\u2019s parents and apologise and see if they would be willing to have a conversation with you so you can try to understand things from E\u2019s perspective. You can also ask if there\u2019s an alternative bathroom available so you can lock it, as I understand it must be uncomfortable for you as a 15 year old girl to use the bathroom in someone else\u2019s house without a lock.", "YTA. From your first paragraph I could tell E isn't \"weird;\" she's neurodivergent. By 15, you should know people don't all process things the same way or react the same way.", "EAH - except the 10yo. \n\nYTA because she has walked in on you before, you know she\u2019s on the spectrum and that there is no lock on the door, you could ask friend to stand guard while you use restroom. And for not requesting that your friend come to your home equally so that you don\u2019t have to always be the one who is uncomfortable. \n\nFriend is AH for not standing guard while your in  the restroom knowing the sister will walk in on you.  And not wanting to spend time at your house equally. I would talk with her about this. Of course we all feel more comfortable in our own space but usually good friends compromise to ensure all parties needs are met. She has no problem with you being uncomfortable in her home, not sure why she can\u2019t spend some time at yours. \n\nFriends mother is AH for not ensuring a safe space for guests in home, knowing younger daughter has special needs and will walk in on people in the restroom. This behavior has been normalized in their home due to the circumstances, but guests should not have to be subjected to this behavior. (I am solely talking about walking in on someone while they are using the toilet, in the shower or changing clothes. The staring behavior, while uncomfortable is not something that can necessarily be policed.) There should be better parental supervision while guests are in home. \n\nYour NTA for being upset that this continually happens. You have a valid reason for being upset that this child continues to walk in on you. I doubt anyone likes being walked in on while they are doing their business. But you shouldn\u2019t call people names, ever. I will  chalk your attitude towards this child up to ignorance as you are still a child yourself. You treat others as you would want to be treated regardless of the situation. ALWAYS be the better person!", "YTA, you are young, and you still have some things to learn about compassion, I hope you do.\n\nI could tell E was autistic long before the edit at the end. She clearly has trouble with social cues. And maybe you don't fully understand that yet. \n\nHere's the thing. You don't have to feel compassion, and you don't have to give her a single inch if her behaviour is inappropriate.\n\nAs long as you understand that you also don't have to be granted a single inch when you go straight to nuclear and call an autistic girl a creep, and the verdict will be asshole.\n\nYou're second-guessing yourself. That's a good thing. It shows you are willing to self-reflect and learn. Keep doing that.", "Yta. You are a guest in their home. She's a kid with additional needs. She msy be 10 but functioning closer to 4. If you aren't comfortable with her, don't go to her home. It's literally her house. She isn't hurting you.", "YTA. Simply for showing no signs of understanding for E. She doesn't do these things to upset you and she might not be a toddler, but she clearly doesn't know better. And I agree that you shouldn't be around E if you cannot deal with her.", "YTA- You made a 10 year old cry because they accidentally walked in on you in the bathroom.

Poor kid is on the spectrum ffs.", "YTA you said it yourself she's on the spectrum so you know she isn't just being weird.

E\u2019s parents should be working to help her understand boundaries and social cues. However, you are the worst in this situation. There\u2019s a little girl who is obviously neuro divergent and instead of showing compassion and understanding and asking oh idk her parents if there\u2019s anything you can do to help mitigate it, you insulted and scared her. That isn\u2019t okay behaviour and you owe E and her parents a huge apology for behaving so cruelly to her in her own home. That should be E\u2019s safe space where she doesn\u2019t have to worry about attitudes like yours.", "Info does e have a crush on you?", "YTA: Knowing she's on the spectrum you need to realize she doesn't get social cues or understands boundaries in the same way you do. Since this has been a systemic problem for you, it would be best if your friend could visit you at your house.", "How about if you take a step towards the mother and ask her for an explanation about the spectrum and what exactly that means for E. I see where you're coming from, but I also know what the spectrum can be about and believe me, it's not her fault at all, none of it. It's more the fault of the parents and your friend for not explaining this to you so that you really understand what's actually going on with E, because that's really important to know.", "ESH. You for calling a kid with disabilities a creep, her family for failing to redirect and enforce boundaries.

Yes, she shouldn\u2019t be entering the bathroom without knocking, yes staring is weird and rude, etc. BUT autistic individuals DO NOT understand social boundaries and etiquette.

I'm not saying that the incident that happened was right, because it wasn't by any means but she is still learning. I see this on repeat in my job, most kids on the spectrum seriously struggle  with social skills, social cues and need to be reminded on repeat of the basics. They are very bright but tend to easily forget things. Often they are mentally younger than their physical age. A serious amount of patience is required. I think the part that really ticked me off was you saying how \"weird\" she was. Seriously, she can't help it. She processes things much differently than others. She just wants to be accepted and included and is going about it in the wrong ways. \n\nEdit to add: Considering OP's mom is in agreement with E's mom, it makes me think that things are bring omitted here and we are not getting the full picture.
