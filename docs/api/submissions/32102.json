When she asked me to help plan her wedding last year, I was so thrilled and happy for her. She's always talked about having her dream wedding since we were teenage girls and made me promise that we would both plan it together. Through the process the one thing that we disagreed on when planning the reception was the meal plan. We went over the menu options together, but I expressed concerns about the limited choices for my dietary preferences. I'm vegetarian for personal reason, so I suggested to have at least one dish be vegetarian, Abby understood but ultimately chose meals that better suited the majority of the guests as she said the cost was not worth the trouble for a dish that \"most people wouldn't like\". I didn't try to argue because ultimately it was her wedding, but I made a joke saying that I would bring my own Tupperware of food and she said she would kill me if I did. \n\nFast forward to the wedding day, I decided to bring my own prepared meal because I really wasn't satisfied with the catering options. I thought it was a subtle way to address my concerns and I did it discreetly in the kitchen of the venue. However, when Abby overheard by some of the her family members helping out in the kitchen of what I had done, she was deeply hurt and upset as they gossiped about it with all the guest. During the reception, she broke down in tears, feeling insulted and embarrassed by my actions. I apologized and told her that it was not my intention to embarrass her but that i've been vegetarian for most of our friendship and that while I was happy for her and her big day, I wasn't going to eat something that I did not enjoy or want. I made a side comment saying that I should've just eaten at home out of frustration and that seemed to upset her more. It seemed that my attempt to express my needs ended up causing a rift between us on her special day, leaving us both feeling hurt and distant despite our long history together.                                                      \n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nFurther Context: There was this one side salad and I did eat it during the reception to not seem rude with declining the entire food offering. During dessert I went to the kitchen and ate my food just in time to be back for the toast. The only other thing I ate was the cake further into the night. That being said, I didn't realize that her aunt, uncle, and cousin were going to be in the kitchen and tell her and the other guest.", "created_utc": 1701404278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1882q8n/aita_for_bringing_my_own_food_to_my_best_friends/", "score": 562, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When the day arrived, I knew they wouldn\u2019t have any choices that didn't suit my preferences, and I did feel a mix of disappointment and frustration.\n\nI thought bringing my meal would solve the problem without causing a scene. I didn't want to make a big fuss but just ensure I could enjoy the celebration comfortably. However, I didn't anticipate \u201cAbby\u2019s\u201d  reaction. Seeing her upset and hurt broke my heart, especially knowing it was her big day. I never intended to hurt her feelings, and now I regret my actions immensely.\nHowever, her entire family and she are making me seem like a monster when I don\u2019t think I am.

So the ruining part is all on her.", "NTA, if you're holding a catered event you have to have an option that addresses dietary requirements among your guests.  There's multiple ways you could do this, the easiest is simply have a vegan option and ask your guests about allergens to ensure there's no issue there either.  If you don't want to deal with the hassle of altering dishes for individual guests you can simply plan a menu that has meal choices that are allergen free and vegan.  What you can't do, is complain that a guest is eating their own food when you chose menu options they couldn't eat.  It's a wedding, you're going to be there for hours, it's pretty exhausting anyway even as a guest, you'll presumably be drinking too.  You can't expect someone to just go hungry all day under those circumstances.", "NTA. You tried to be discreet, it's not like you sat down to dinner and got the tupperware out. \n\nWhen I got married, we had a buffet with a lot of options so anyone could find something they could eat. Regardless if they're vegetarian, had an allergy, etc. I'm vegetarian, husband is not, most of the guests weren't, so of course there was some meat, but plenty of other things to eat. \nOur reasoning was that a set menu is more difficult to get right for everyone, and it would be more of a hassle for us and the caterer to get separate meals for a few people who had special diet needs. \n\nWhat I wasn't going to do was exclude one of my guests from my wedding meal.\nOne person got a cupcake instead of wedding cake due to a dairy allergy, that didn't exactly break the budget. \nOne vegetarian meal wouldn't have been impossible to sort out. Any special dinner I've been to (weddings, graduations, birthdays) especially a catered one, has had options.

And you were discreet AF by eating in the kitchen. You literally didn\u2019t even bring attention to the act. \nShe\u2019s in the wrong for not providing a veg option.

This isn\u2019t unusual, nobody thought to ask?", "NTA.  I truly don\u2019t understand how someone having an event cannot cater for something so Main Stream as vegetarian (or gluten free or vegan). We had a reception two years ago.  We chose a fish main or a chicken main and people would rsvp their choice. I put on the invitation to please let me know if any allergies or intolerances. We ended up having about 5 people needing something different and the chef was accommodating. \n\nIt boils down to this, are you inviting someone as your guest to celebrate with you or are you inviting people purely to fill space, not as a guest. Guests you do things for, you\u2019re giving them your hospitality. Only providing for them something that they cannot eat, either through ideology or health concerns, is not giving hospitality. \n\nThe rude (AH) one was your friend.

My very meat loving friends had veggie and vegan options for a few of us at the wedding who don't eat meat. I only went to one wedding where there were no veggie options except some side veg and luckily that was when I still ate meat and they weren't actually my friends anyway I was my pals plus one. You tried to keep it subtle it is not your fault her family saw and were gossiping about it. There are also so many delicious vegetarian meals out there I refuse to believe that most of her other guests wouldn't like every single thing that has no meat.", "NTA you did the very best you could. You were very discrete, too! Not like you broke out some Tupperware at the table or anything. You were polite during the meal, then slipped into the kitchen to eat! \n\nI think she\u2019s just embarrassed she didn\u2019t host properly. Providing a vegetarian option is pretty standard. I\u2019m guessing this was a low budget wedding (aunt and uncle helping in the kitchen) and not a catered event and she got overwhelmed. She was still wrong, of course.", "NTA. Wedding culture has become so fucking ridiculous. The bride didn't even have to have a vegetarian option, just 1 meal for OP. Who ate her meal discreetly away from the reception to be police.

Maybe when she\u2019s calmed down explain that there wasn\u2019t anything for you to eat and rather than cause a scene by passing out you discreetly ate away from other guests but it was her Aunt, Uncle and cousin who witnessed you doing so and they went round telling everyone", "NTA and if anyone are the A-holes it\u2019s the gossipy family members.

I asked if it was okay for us to order something for ourselves from somewhere else and she had zero issues with this. We were going to pay for it ourselves, pick it up and not worry about it. We even ordered a couple allergy friendly desserts because we couldn\u2019t eat hers. Out of the blue she asked for the bill for our food because her mother who covered the cost of the food for the wedding was offering to pay for ours too. That was super kind.\nFor our wedding we had two vegans and one person who says they are vegetarian but really isn\u2019t as she eats what she wants whether it is vegetarian or not but we still made sure there were vegan options at our wedding.", "NTA it\u2019s normal these days to put on 1 veggie or vegan choice as it\u2019s unusual these days to not have at least a few people who have this diet.

I mean, I\u2019m by no means vegetarian myself, I love dishes like steak and salmon and eat a lot of things with chicken in them, but I don\u2019t have to go out of my way to eat and enjoy dishes that are considered vegetarian because they simply don\u2019t have meat in them, and there are many dishes on every restaurant menu that don\u2019t have meat in them.\n\nAt my sisters wedding she had one bar that was a mac and cheese bar, where you got your plain macaroni and cheese and then went down the line and decided what you wanted to put in it. There were extra kinds of cheeses, meats like bacon and chicken and pulled pork, and veggies like broccoli and celery and asparagus, and what you put in it was completely your choice.\n\nA simple but delicious pasta could have sufficed, something with lots of cheese and either marinara or Alfredo sauce, or maybe both to the side so each person could choose which sauce they wanted.\n\nEven if you are only vegetarian because of a personal moral code, your friend should have considered that she doesn\u2019t know the dietary restrictions of possibly many people at her wedding.

Is she going to scream and cry and throw a fit because I can\u2019t eat food that could directly affect my health?\n\nIn the future I\u2019d say the only thing you can change is to eat before the wedding and reception so you won\u2019t go starving until you get home, and if anyone asks why you\u2019re not eating, offer a simple \u201cI\u2019m not hungry\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll get some later, thanks!\u201d And then when someone sees you enjoying cake later they won\u2019t keep asking.\n\nBut you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA.

Mostly this is on the friend\u2019s family but it feels like this became an unnecessarily awkward situation.", "Onions and garlic saut\u00e9ed with diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, herbs and spices and rice.. https://realgreekrecipes.com/greek-tomato-rice/", "Yeah, bride should be mad at herself and her AH family members who gleefully spread the word to unrelated guests, not the OP who tried to be as discreet as she could. What else was she to do, eat in the toilet?", "Exactly it would not have been hard for bride to accommodate the BFF if they could both agree", "One of the reasons I think buffets are better is that you can offer more options than a sit down meal. I\u2019ve been to both types of events and the variety is way better at a buffet. If you don\u2019t eat meat you fill up on veggie sides to make a full plate.", "It depends on the size of your wedding and how well you know your guests. We\u2019ve dined with all our guests and knew that they are not vegetarian and would not want most vegetarian options.", "The bride brushed it off and then expected exactly what to happen? Did she think her vegetarian friend would just decide to eat a steak that night just to keep the peace? Or was she supposed to be the only one at the reception not eating?\n\nI have been a vegetarian for almost 25 years and I can tell you, being the only person not eating at a sit down dinner is awkward as hell. She would have drawn a lot of attention from guests asking why she wasn\u2019t eating, doesn\u2019t she like the food, is she sick, etc. People notice if you\u2019re just sitting there not eating and will ask.\n\nHer plan to quietly bring food and eat it out of sight was perfectly reasonable given the bride did absolutely nothing to accommodate her, not only so that she wouldn\u2019t go hungry but also so that she wouldn\u2019t draw attention to herself by not eating any of the dinner or having her own food. She couldn\u2019t plan for the family members to be such obnoxious gossips/assholes when they spotted her eating quietly in the kitchen.", "OP went to the kitchen to eat her meal and didn't know the bride's family was there, I wouldn't call that ostentatious.\n\nHonestly the thought of having a wedding and not even bothering to provide food my close friends can eat? That's insane to me.", "I agree that this could all have been easily avoided with some simple communication. When the bride reacted negatively to the \u201cjoke\u201d about OP bringing her own food, she should have seriously asked what her friend suggested as a solution, stating clearly that there would be nothing of the catered options for her to eat. It was really a missed opportunity to resolve everything before it even became an issue.", "OP basically tried and the bride shut her down for no real reason. She gave OP zero options and then got upset about it.", "Agreed here. I don\u2019t think OP is a dick but the way this was handled by all parties is insane.", "Do you know what they charge for a plate versus an option for all. That\u2019s where the accommodation I\u2019m taking about could be done. What about dietary restrictions? How do they accommodate that?", "I'm sorry but your caterers sound awful. Maybe the food is good, but I've never heard of a caterer being so unwilling to accommodate two meals. Not to mention it can be a medical thing for people and they may need to actually have their own meals that they've prepared.", "You couldn't have had just 2 plates of some simple veggie plates? That seems wild to me. What about people what about people who just have allergies? I don't men you specifically, but just in general having that as an option?", "But also most Americans overestimate how much protein you actually need.  Eating mainly carbs for one meal is fine, seriously.", "I grew up eating this. My mom and I would make it at least once a week or two.. it can be made in the oven or in the stove. It\u2019s actually delicious and filling. And other veggie heavy dishes. \n\nhttps://realgreekrecipes.com/greek-tomato-rice/\n\nAnd yes I know vegetarians need protein as I cooked for my vegetarian / vegan son when he was one but we are talking one meal option here to accommodate someone that isn\u2019t salad..", "She didnt even have to provide it as a whole vegetarian option with multiple meals, it could have easily just have been 1 for the supposed best friend she is ( if you can do that I\u2019m not sure)", "It sounds like this happened before the menu was set", "I've been to many and there was always a choice / I'm vegan / \n\nSounds like the bride's dream wedding included meat dishes only \ud83d\ude11", "A side salad isn\u2019t a meal! What did she expect you to do? Suddenly be a carnivore for the evening. When I got married we did a barbecue and had vegetarian and vegan options for the few that were there and even the ice cream van we made sure they had a vegan option. It\u2019s really not hard to include a meal for 1 or 2 people with dietary requirements. Your friend sounds like a headache. And not to be that bitch, but if you sneaking off to the kitchen to eat is capable of ruining her whole evening then the wedding can\u2019t have been that great in the first place.", "Then based on this NTA. How can she have all meat dishes? Was no one else vegetarian or vegan? Usually you ask people for their deitary requirements so you can cater for them. Seeing as you were helping her plan then she knows you don't eat meat. That's a bit weird. \n\nShe seems like a big drama queen with that reaction.", "I\u2019ve been to a wedding where the only meal was ribs, coleslaw, beans and bread rolls. We also stayed overnight at the venue because it was remote and my partner was involved in the wedding. I was so hungry until we got home the next day. Coke slaw and bread (I assumed the beans were baked with pork) was not a real meal. NTA.", "the ceremony itself is usually only a few hours.

Youve either only gone to one wedding ever or youve gone to multiple wreddings an dyoure well aware that they dont all last 8 hours. Dont argue a point based off of an exception.", "I can\u2019t figure out why the aunt and uncle even felt the need to mention it to the bride. Strange people.", "\"Most of the dishes have meat\"? What? I've literally never been to a wedding where ANY dish had meat in it except for whatever the entree itself was - a single piece of chicken or beef - and that was always served with potatoes or rice, and veggies. \n\nWhat on earth kind of weddings are you going to that all the side dishes have meat? Potatoes with meat? Rice with meat? Veggies with meat?", "Doesn\u2019t say one single dish. It says one dish. There is a difference and from it sounds like, she wanted there to be enough for those wanting vegetarian. But if she did mean one single dish, yeah that is kinda an asshole move because of expense.", "For real. I just found out that at my wedding, one of my bridesmaids and her husband left for a bit to go up to the bridal party bathroom and have sex. I thought it was hilarious, I\u2019m not going to ruin a friendship over it.", "Wedding guests are no longer people sharing your special day, they are there to make your day special. They should tell you that you look fantastic, give you expensive gifts and look good in the photos. They are basically props or extras, and as such it's ok to micro-manage their clothes and hair, make them wait for hours, not give them food, etc.", "I think the \u201cissue\u201d is that it reflects very poorly on the friend that she didn\u2019t care to include her best friends dietary restrictions", "Because to those types of people, the wedding is all that matters. They\u2019re not excited about marriage, they\u2019re excited about the _wedding_.

Tantrums/meltdowns over the simplest things. That's for when the bride/groom doesn't show up. Lol", "My question is why were the cousin aunt and uncle gossiping about someone with a different diet eating in the kitchen?? How fucking boring lmao.", "Totally weird. It\u2019s like, the relatives thought that it was SO important that she was eating something different *in the kitchen* that they felt it necessary to inform the bride in the middle of the reception?  This family sounds like a bunch of drama queens (and kings).", "Actually her wording there really stuck out to me. She said that\u2019s what she ate when food was served\u2026.not that thats all there was available to her. Her word choice felt very specific.", "Its like the cheese pizza rule. No one says they want it but it's gone before everything else.  Gotta do half plus 1 pizza of cheese.", "I can see that happening especially when the dishes look appetizing and isn\u2019t just rabbit food. I like rabbit food but not as a main but in addition. I eat meat but usually it\u2019s what is with the meat that I rather have more. Stew beef. A little bit of the meat and a lot of potato, carrots, onion and gravy. It\u2019s all good.", ">another guest had a bad allergy\n\n\nI read that as bat allergy lol", "And depending on the meal and dietary restrictions, it's entirely possible that the same ingredients could be used - the same pasta and a portion of the sauce that doesn't have meat, the same veggies saut\u00e9ed in oil instead of butter, etc.", "I mean there's a difference between accommodating 1 person and accommodating 30% of your guests. Not really comparable situations.", "The idea of not having a vegetarian option in this day and age is shocking to me. I get if she was gluten free nut free vegan or whatever, but to not offer a single vegetarian entr\u00e9e? That's ridiculous.", "Yeah this is where it tipped me to NTA\n\nIf OP was just like \"if I have to eat one more bland pasta with three giant pieces of carrot, broccoli, and cauliflower that are clearly just microwaved I will fucking scream\" I would understand (been there) but OP would have been the AH.\n\nYour BEST FRIEND provides nothing except a side salad that's probably 3 pieces of iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge, and maybe a slice of red onion and that's IT? Firm N T A. \n\nI had a cousin do something similar to me. We weren't close but she and her family are incredibly picky eaters. They came over for Christmas every year and my mom bent over fucking backwards for them. We couldn't even have pepper in anything because she doesn't like it. No spices, everything so bland. Her wedding, nothing but side salads for me and the other vegetarians. Washed my hands of her that day. My mom had guilted me into going to the wedding and she has not spoken one word about being doing a single thing for that cousin since. I've ignored every baby shower and other gift grab she has tried to get from me.", ">that OPs friend didn't even offer a vegetarian option beside a small salad\n\nMy suspicion with this is that, originally, OP said that there were vegetarian options but she didn't want to eat something that she didn't want or enjoy. Then, when people commented on her being fussy, she updated that there was only one side salad and that she did eat it - so, if that's the case, why did she say that she didn't want to eat dishes because she wouldn't enjoy them?", "Yep cannot agree more. \n\nAlso when you done you almost guaranteed to have food for 2/3 days afterwards.", "When I was shopping around, even the venues that were per plate and not a package had a charge for every additional option. For example, a venue would be $3000 to rent, and food plates would range from $25 - $45/ person. But every additional food option after either 1 or 2 options would cost anywhere from $1-$5/person to add on. Children\u2019s meals were normally an exception, but most places have an automatic \u201cif you\u2019re 12 or under you get the kids meal, period\u201d so it\u2019s not really an option. \n\nOnce you start considering guest counts and service fees/taxes, it really starts getting expensive to add more options for people. I think it has to do with the fact that the more options you have, the more complicated it is for the caterer/servers to figure out.\n\nThey did normally have exceptions for allergies, but didn\u2019t include vegetarians in that. Idk why, it could also be the area we were looking in.", "The venue we chose treats allergies and food preferences differently (and considers people who are vegetarian to be a food preference) - so if they had celiac disease or something, they would have altered one of the existing menu options to be gluten free or (if that wasn\u2019t possible) would have given a singular gluten free option free of charge. But choosing a vegetarian meal is entirely different in their books -  then we\u2019re adding another meal onto the options.\n\nIf I had to bet, I bet it\u2019s liability. A vegetarian isn\u2019t gonna die if they eat meat, so they don\u2019t have to go through the work of adding an additional meal to the menu. A person with a severe peanut allergy will. Idk though, I\u2019m not a lawyer. \n\nTo be clear - I\u2019m not saying I agree that every little thing costs extra money, it just is the way it is. If I had to bet; the system is in place because prepping three meals split evenly between 200 people is harder than prepping two meals, and they just assume if you add an additional option then a third of people will choose that. I don\u2019t know, all I know is that we were told they can\u2019t add a vegetarian option free of charge without a food allergy.", "I'm just saying at weddings I've been to the options are often chicken, beef or cheese. I've been served salads I can't eat because they dumped cheese on it.", "Cheese makes me vomit, the thought of eating it makes me nauseous.\n\nI can eat ice cream & yogurt, so it's not lactose. I have no interest in dairy free cheese, I just want lasagna & pizza without it.", "Again, considering she has been helping the bride plan the wedding, it's likely that she has been involved and helping the day of. Probably not just showing up at ceremony time. Even if she ate before arriving, by the time the ceremony actually begins, finishes, cocktail hour takes place, reception begins, food comes out, it's understandable she'd be hungry again.  \n\nAlso if she's important enough that her stepping away for a few minutes is so noticeable then how is she not important enough to be provided a meal? Or to not be vilified for eating her own meal out of the view of other guests. \n\nNo, my logic is not 2 wrongs make a right. Because she hasn't done anything wrong.", "Maybe they thought the bride was tacky as hell for not having a vegetarian option.", "I agree completely.", "Lots of weddings have lasagna or other meat pasta, that\u2019s what we had at ours (and veg and vegan). \n\nNot everyone can eat bread.", ">Wedding guests are no longer people sharing your special day, they are there to make your day special. \n\nI think the other end of this is that people forget that they are choosing to *host* a wedding. Yes it's your party, but you are the host and all the rules of good hosting still apply. People have completely forgotten about weddings.", "Agreed.

I asked what kind and she said whatever. I got one with half Hawaiian because my husband likes that. What did MIL go for? The Hawaiian!  Ummm if I knew you would have eaten than I would have gotten a whole one!!!", "This! I work at a school and frequently order pizza for students and teachers. ALWAYS get more cheese than you think.", "I mean, owlsandmoths did also say that there were two dishes geared towards only their fiance due to celiac. So there is a decent comparison there.", "When only one person is celiac, they didn\u2019t have to accommodate one person by providing two celiac dishes, yet they did. The difference in price for having the vegan, vegetarian options and two celiac dishes added a whole $120 to the total cost of the food bill. But when you\u2019re speaking in thousands for food cost, $120 added in is peanuts in the grande scheme to accommodate everyone.", "I mean in the main post it says that she asked for the friend to have one meal be vegetarian and the friend declined because most people wouldn\u2019t like it, so there was never a full vegetarian meal.", "OP says the friend didn't want to do a vegetarian option because the rest of the guests wouldn't like the food", "I think she couldn't enjoy them because they had meat in them and it went against her personal reasons for being a vegetarian. \nIt is possible she considered eating all but the meat in a dish and decided not to because she couldn't enjoy knowing it was prepared with meats.", "I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but some vegetarians, after years of doing so, can't digest meat. I honestly don't see how substituting a veggie for meat on a few plates would cost them much.  Not arguing with you. I just think it is silly when other allowances are made.", "So OP is supposed to not eat all day? Like why would you want your best friend to starve?", "Usually you are up early if they share a room, get everyone showered, breakfast, hair and make up which depending how many bridesmaids are can take a while with  one person doing it all. Then getting everyone dressed. All while having pictures taken. Then some do first look photos. Getting everyone in line and ready for the actual ceremony.  Get everyone to the reception for meal, toasts, cake, dancing and then winding for the night. Family and friends help get the gifts home and make sure things are not left at the reception venue. Then you have to go home take off all your makeup, get showerd. There is also alcohol at most these events. I have seen where brides have started with mimosa in the morning. This can to you being very sick. She went to the KITCHEN. She didn't pull out a Tupperware at the table in front of everyone.", "Cool, eat the chicken or steak!", "Fair enough, that\u2019s as good a reason as any to not have cheese.", "We had a set menu and it included a meat, chicken, fish, and vegetarian.

They had steak with a side of chicken and pork?  No potatoes?  no bread?  *Again*, the way she did it was tacky.
