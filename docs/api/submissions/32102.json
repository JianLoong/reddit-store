When she asked me to help plan her wedding last year, I was so thrilled and happy for her. She's always talked about having her dream wedding since we were teenage girls and made me promise that we would both plan it together. Through the process the one thing that we disagreed on when planning the reception was the meal plan. We went over the menu options together, but I expressed concerns about the limited choices for my dietary preferences. I'm vegetarian for personal reason, so I suggested to have at least one dish be vegetarian, Abby understood but ultimately chose meals that better suited the majority of the guests as she said the cost was not worth the trouble for a dish that \"most people wouldn't like\". I didn't try to argue because ultimately it was her wedding, but I made a joke saying that I would bring my own Tupperware of food and she said she would kill me if I did. \n\nFast forward to the wedding day, I decided to bring my own prepared meal because I really wasn't satisfied with the catering options. I thought it was a subtle way to address my concerns and I did it discreetly in the kitchen of the venue. However, when Abby overheard by some of the her family members helping out in the kitchen of what I had done, she was deeply hurt and upset as they gossiped about it with all the guest. During the reception, she broke down in tears, feeling insulted and embarrassed by my actions. I apologized and told her that it was not my intention to embarrass her but that i've been vegetarian for most of our friendship and that while I was happy for her and her big day, I wasn't going to eat something that I did not enjoy or want. I made a side comment saying that I should've just eaten at home out of frustration and that seemed to upset her more. It seemed that my attempt to express my needs ended up causing a rift between us on her special day, leaving us both feeling hurt and distant despite our long history together.                                                      \n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nFurther Context: There was this one side salad and I did eat it during the reception to not seem rude with declining the entire food offering. During dessert I went to the kitchen and ate my food just in time to be back for the toast. The only other thing I ate was the cake further into the night. That being said, I didn't realize that her aunt, uncle, and cousin were going to be in the kitchen and tell her and the other guest.", "created_utc": 1701404278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1882q8n/aita_for_bringing_my_own_food_to_my_best_friends/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When the day arrived, I knew they wouldn\u2019t have any choices that didn't suit my preferences, and I did feel a mix of disappointment and frustration.\n\nI thought bringing my meal would solve the problem without causing a scene. I didn't want to make a big fuss but just ensure I could enjoy the celebration comfortably. However, I didn't anticipate \u201cAbby\u2019s\u201d  reaction. Seeing her upset and hurt broke my heart, especially knowing it was her big day. I never intended to hurt her feelings, and now I regret my actions immensely.\nHowever, her entire family and she are making me seem like a monster when I don\u2019t think I am.

I\u2019ve always been hungry and heading for the takeaway as soon I left a wedding because generally the portions are small and the food not anywhere near as good as it could be for the cost.

Between the butter and eggs... have a salad and eat something substantial before/after the festivities.\n\nEven with all that, you knew her family was working in the kitchen.

So the ruining part is all on her.", "NTA, if you're holding a catered event you have to have an option that addresses dietary requirements among your guests.  There's multiple ways you could do this, the easiest is simply have a vegan option and ask your guests about allergens to ensure there's no issue there either.  If you don't want to deal with the hassle of altering dishes for individual guests you can simply plan a menu that has meal choices that are allergen free and vegan.  What you can't do, is complain that a guest is eating their own food when you chose menu options they couldn't eat.  It's a wedding, you're going to be there for hours, it's pretty exhausting anyway even as a guest, you'll presumably be drinking too.  You can't expect someone to just go hungry all day under those circumstances.", "NTA. You tried to be discreet, it's not like you sat down to dinner and got the tupperware out. \n\nWhen I got married, we had a buffet with a lot of options so anyone could find something they could eat. Regardless if they're vegetarian, had an allergy, etc. I'm vegetarian, husband is not, most of the guests weren't, so of course there was some meat, but plenty of other things to eat. \nOur reasoning was that a set menu is more difficult to get right for everyone, and it would be more of a hassle for us and the caterer to get separate meals for a few people who had special diet needs. \n\nWhat I wasn't going to do was exclude one of my guests from my wedding meal.\nOne person got a cupcake instead of wedding cake due to a dairy allergy, that didn't exactly break the budget. \nOne vegetarian meal wouldn't have been impossible to sort out. Any special dinner I've been to (weddings, graduations, birthdays) especially a catered one, has had options.

We had a reception two years ago.  We chose a fish main or a chicken main and people would rsvp their choice. I put on the invitation to please let me know if any allergies or intolerances. We ended up having about 5 people needing something different and the chef was accommodating. \n\nIt boils down to this, are you inviting someone as your guest to celebrate with you or are you inviting people purely to fill space, not as a guest. Guests you do things for, you\u2019re giving them your hospitality.

You were polite during the meal, then slipped into the kitchen to eat! \n\nI think she\u2019s just embarrassed she didn\u2019t host properly. Providing a vegetarian option is pretty standard.

Not eat a full meal at her wedding (go hungry): OR\n2. Not be a vegetarian for the day because it's 'her special day' and she needs everything her way.\n\nNTA you were way more discreet than I would have been but I would have a serious think about the lack of respect your 'best friend' is showing you.", "Long time vegetarian here. I\u2019m going to say NTA \n\nI find it hard to believe you are the only person she knows who would want a meatless option or any other type of dietary restriction. It\u2019s also just rude to knowingly exclude someone. If there was some legit reason she couldn\u2019t get a veg meal (which I doubt) then she should have been ok with you bringing your own. She rejected every alternative you proposed, what were you supposed to do? Without knowing the exact schedule of the event idk if there was a time when it would have been more subtle to slip away and eat, but you can\u2019t be expected to get through the whole thing on nothing but a side salad. \n\nBeing vegetarian (or vegan) isn\u2019t the same as just not liking something. You really can\u2019t eat the things you\u2019ve cut out. It may not be as dire as an allergy but it\u2019s akin to a sensitivity in that you probably will feel awful if you were to eat meat. (And no it\u2019s not the same as a meat eater having a vegetarian meal, that literally will not harm them at all.)", "YTA for bringing your own food after talking to the b ride about it and learning she hated the idea. Yeah, sometimes the food at a wedding sucks, sometimes there is not a single thing you really want to eat, but it is not about the food, and your actions obviously caused a stir. Yes, maybe you should have eaten at home, or maybe you should have sucked it up, but the way you went about it did not show much regard for your friend's feelings.", "NTA obviously but your friend is a major AH. You're a vegetarian and she didn't provide any food for you?! Veggie and vegan options are standard these days and if she didn't understand that in the abstract she should at least have had some for you.", "ESH\n\nI'm sure you could have eaten something and eaten before or after too. \n\nBut she overreacted. Why would someone eating food make you cry? \n\nAre you sure you guys like each other? You seem to be trying to make points against the other.", "NTA\n\nYou're best friends and she didn't cater to your very normal diet, forcing you to feel like you had to hide in the kitchen to eat. Food is very important to me, so I'd personally want everyone to be happy with the food even if the rest of the wedding was a shit show \ud83d\ude02\n\nI'm 19w pregnant and opted for the vegetarian options for my best friend's wedding last weekend (there were vegan, vegetarian, and meat options, with the obvious chance to explain allergies). I'm usually a meat eater, but when I chose from the menu I'd just, that night, almost thrown up at the sight and smell of raw sausages. I was only 7w at the time, so I chose veggie options just incase.", "NTA she broke down in tears over this? That is some controlling behaviour, and she doesn't sound like a great friend if her plan for guests at her wedding was to basically not feed them whilst other people ate. You haven't caused a rift, she has.", "NTA. that's not a friend tbh. and she made it worse by being mad at you for bringing your own food. \nShe can't have it both ways... either she has a menu for people with food specificities, or she doesn't get offended if people bring their own food. \n\nIt's like people wanting a child free wedding but getting mad at parents who can't attend....", "NTA her Aunt, Uncle and cousin are though. I\u2019ve been married over 30 years and we had a vegetarian option for our reception, I\u2019m shocked that there wasn\u2019t one. What if a guest had an anaphylactic allergy or couldn\u2019t eat something due to religion? etc. From the way you describe it you did all you could to be discreet. Maybe when she\u2019s calmed down explain that there wasn\u2019t anything for you to eat and rather than cause a scene by passing out you discreetly ate away from other guests but it was her Aunt, Uncle and cousin who witnessed you doing so and they went round telling everyone", "NTA and if anyone are the A-holes it\u2019s the gossipy family members. They\u2019re the shit starters.", "NTA. Your friend\u2019s behavior was strange and weirdly controlling.  Hope this isn\u2019t her norm.", "NTA, I am vegan and frequently will bring my own dish to the venue. I do it discretely and normally notify the bride or groom (whichever Im closest to) with a message coinciding with the invitation saying, \u201chey I was wondering if there would be any vegan options? Totally fine if not as I\u2019ll bring my own but wanted to ask because you can often save a little money as you don\u2019t have to include me in the food count :)\n\nIt\u2019s way more rude to expect someone not to eat for hours while drinking", "YTA. A massive A. She told you in advance about her feelings if you brought your tupperware. But somehow, even on her special day, you still did. I wonder if the roles were reversed, if you had a vegetarian mealplan on your wedding and she brought a tupperware full of meat, how you would feel. /AITA would unleash absolute hellfire on that choice.\n\nBut as per usual with vegatarians, their beliefs seem to trump whatever situation they find themselves in.", "NTA why does she care?  If you were a diabetic and stuck off to give yourself a shot, would she have a fit about that also?  WHY DOES SHE CARE??", "She told her no to her suggestion OP said okay, made a joke ( which really wasn\u2019t a joke because you did it) she told you she would \u201cKill you\u201d you still went and did it. Yes it wasn\u2019t out and open but you knew how she felt. You should\u2019ve just eaten a big meal at home or right before you guys got dressed to begin with if you felt so strongly about it. No it wasn\u2019t unreasonable what you asked for especially considering you guys have been friends for a long time and she\u2019s known you\u2019re a vegetarian. Most of us would\u2019ve probably made accommodations for you ( hell I wouldn\u2019t have cared that you went to the kitchen to eat) but she did and you knew she felt strongly about it and agreed ? (You led her to believe you were okay with it you didn\u2019t really put up a fight)  so I have to give you a soft YTA. Sorry. But the fallout was all very stupid she and her family made nothing into something", "She broke down in tears because OP stepped out for a few minutes to have a quick bite, that is just deranged. NTA", "Has run - not ran", "Yeah, definitely NTA. You tried to do this in as discreet a way as possible; it\u2019s not like you told her Great Aunt Margie to hold the lid of your Tupperware while you scarfed it down at the table while complaining about your friend\u2019s lack of dish variety. Also, what was your alternative? To just eat a side salad and not drink, feasible sure, but pretty dull as it is a wedding\u2026or you could have still drank and possibly wound up being publicly sick because you\u2019d only eaten a side salad\u2026that would have been way more of a scene.\n\nFrankly, the people who saw you should have just kept their mouths shut; what a bunch of needless busybodies with clearly nothing worthwhile happening in their lives!\n\nTell your friend you\u2019d welcome a conversation if and when she decides to resume living on this planet, as you did everything you could think of to accommodate your friend\u2019s vision while making sure that you were taken care of.", "Don't people confirm which they want? Unless it's a buffet, I don't get why offering an option people don't go for is a problem.", "I've been to a lot where I can't eat the vegetarian dish because it contains cheese. I can eat chicken or steak, etc... bur I cannot eat cheese.", "My nephew just had a wedding and had stuffed mushrooms that were vegetarian and a cheese and fruit board (it was buffet style).  All that was gone first so to say other guests won't like it is just plain wrong.", "I agree, it\u2019s common these days for dietary requirements to be added in on an ad hoc basis, what happened to the vegans, the coeliac and so on?", "I was vegetarian when my brother got married and they very sweetly had a dish made for me that was vegetarian (it was catered by an Italian place). Honestly what I was given sucked, it was pasta and spinach drenched in butter. If my head was more clear I would\u2019ve eaten the meaty main dish as it was clearly delectable. But did I complain or tell them? Heck no! I ate my stupid dish and had a great time celebrating the happy couple!", "NTA\u2026 having atleast one vegetarian dish would not have killed her budget. U do get some yumm  veg options which compliment non veg dishes too. Was she expecting u to starve or just survive on cake and salad?", "I spend most of my week eating like a vegetarian, just because not everything needs meat in it.. (given I mostly eat noodels with some sort of sauce or bread with some variant of topping, but my point stands)", "Garlic and tomato are two really common and aggressive allergens. The sauce would have to be checked for potentially common allergies. And the veggies would have to be checked. It's not all black and white, every single dish you said has common allergens as ingredients.\n\nAlso, seriously, it was super rude of her to get the tupperware. She could have declined the meal saying she wasn't feeling well. Both sides have their reasons to be the AH, so I think EAH.", "I got married nearly 6 years ago and we had people stipulate their dietary requirement on their RSVP. They made meals for the GF/vegan/vegetarian and pescatarians. \n\nNTA", "Yeah, there was this one side salad and I did eat it during the reception to not to seem rude with declining the entire food offering. During dessert I went to the kitchen and ate my food just in time to be back for the toast. The only other thing I ate was the cake further into the night.

Smh", "So she should starved or make herself sick eating something she hasn\u2019t ate in years?", "If OP ha been vegetarian for years, her body would likely seriously struggle digesting meat. I agree with the ESH - Bride for not being accomodating but OP for not clearly expressing she would be either bringing her own food or not coming", "man, fuck starving at an event, absolutely bonkers that anyone would essentially demand that someone go without food because \"muh wedding day\". it's insane to expect that of people we're supposed to care about.", "Most of the dishes have meat in them at weddings and why should she have to be hungry she wasn\u2019t hurting anyone", "If she didn\u2019t want to feel embarrassed, she could\u2019ve compromised with her so called friend. Who knows how eating something she hasn\u2019t eaten in years, would do to her? why are y\u2019all okay with people risking their health for somebody\u2019s wedding day?", "There\u2019s plenty of side options that would have worked esp if she was helping plan. There\u2019s more to this story lol.", "Yeah, there was this one side salad and I did eat it during the reception to not to seem rude with declining the entire food offering.

She NTA & you agreeing with the bride shows how much you care about your friends", "Lmao maybe people shouldn't be shallow gossipers? Or care and assume what others do? Her friend not being ok with her bringing a little bit of her for food because she is a vegetarian it's unreasonable, she is NTA", "Why couldn\u2019t her friend put vegan options knowing that\u2019s what her friend is?", "Agreed. Op YTA.", "[deleted]", "I really don't understand weddings anymore. Who cares that someone stepped out a moment and did something different? It did not effect the proceedings at all. All these tantrums boil down to childish 'you didn't do it the way I wanted on my special day'. \nPeople really need to get over themselves.", "Right? I was thinking OP whipped out her Tupperware at the table during dinner and thought, yeah, understandable but pretty rude. But to sit and eat something politely during dinner then slip out to the kitchen to eat later, especially during dessert when no one would notice? The bride only knew because the aunt tattled. Totally understandable. (Which why did the aunt care anyway? Weird family)", "Sounds like it was a set menu and OPs only option was a side salad.", "They aren\u2019t saying to only provide a vegetarian meal- they are showing options of vegetarian meals that are inexpensive to add to a catered meal. You would still get to eat chicken or steak and not have to touch the vegetarian meal. The above message is not for you!", "Lactose intolerance or allergy? If it\u2019s an allergy, I recommend the babybel dairy free cheese, it tastes pretty good.", "We were required to have a vegetarian dish for ours, which was fine because I have family that are vegetarians! It was ravioli in a truffle cream sauce and it was fantastic.\n\nAlso another guest had a bad allergy so we made sure that item wasn\u2019t included for their table, it\u2019s not hard to make accommodations!", "That's called \"being an adult and having manners\".", "But you had one! It seeemed to me, that OPs friend didn't even offer a vegetarian option beside a small salad.", "Uh? Unless someone has stated they have food allergies, no food would need to be checked. As many said here, it's usually no issue for the caterer to fix one vegetarian meal. OP doesn't mention food allergies in the post. Most foods have allergens that can trigger someone's allergy. I'm allergic to cabbage, and other stuff that are quite uncommon allergens.", "Yeah she should probably starve herself \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And what, just survive on salad for a day as MoH? That's a whole day affair.", "I wouldn't equate a side salad to a meal option, really.

Without them deliberately making trouble, your brief foray into the kitchen would have been perfectly discreet and wouldn't have upset the bride at all. It's not like you took out the Tupperware at the table in the middle of the reception, and started complaining to everyone about the bride making you go hungry!", "NTA - I think this is fine. Your friend has over-reacted.", "I think moreso they're suggesting that OP should've just eaten beforehand or eaten after they got home, not that they should eat meat for the first time in years. I've had to do it at a couple weddings and while it sucks I still probably wouldn't bring my own Tupperware because it's pretty rude. Maybe a granola or protein bar but definitely not a full meal in Tupperware. There's so many ways you can plan ahead that aren't as gauche. OP's friend sucks but OP could have handled it better as well. Both of them should have had an actual discussion about it and all of this could have been avoided.", "She could have easily eaten before, had a salad there, and eaten dinner at home \ud83e\udd23\n\nNo one was going to hold her at gunpoint and demand she have a steak.", "She shouldn't have to be hungry. It would be weird if every side dish contained meat. It's weird if every salad contains meat. It's downright bizarre if the wedding cake or other desserts contain meat. \n\nOP is either not vegetarian or not honest about the menu, one or the other.", "I agree, it honestly sounds like they wanted to draw attention to themselves. If you are aware and took planning of the meal and were told not to bring your own you could have ate before and after. Side salad and cake can hold you off for a while. Assuming the wedding didn't go over 6 hours.", "So basically the meal was a salad and a plate of meat?  No potato/rice, no veg, no bread, etc.?  Or were they all made with meat?  Honestly I\u2019ve  never seen a wedding meal like that\u2026or are you actually vegan?", "Again, there\u2019s nothing subtle about bringing your own food to the kitchen of a catered event. \n\nYou failed to truly discuss this with her. You made a comment and she told you not to. You then just decided to do it and then are surprised that she\u2019s mad. I mean, God forbid you discuss further instead of going behind her back and just doing whatever you wanted. \n\nAgain, there were ways to handle this well. Your way was not one of them.", "Yes I have. Multiple times. \n\nAgain, this day is about the bride and groom. \n\nTake some snacks - not a Tupperware full of food. It\u2019s one day. Not a week. Have a good breakfast, have some snacks handy. \n\nOr they could have had the conversation when she said she will bring a Tupperware and the bride said \u201cI will kill you if you do that\u201d. Have the confrontation (if that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be) beforehand. Don\u2019t wait until the wedding day. \nWhy didn\u2019t she say then:\u201d wait hold up, what am I supposed to eat then?\u201d If you\u2019re going to keep quiet in that moment, then be prepared to take snacks, eat beforehand etc.", "But the set menus usually have options, you can have this main Vs that main... and adding an option, the catering company gets numbers for who wants what in advance and buys ingredients based on the confirmed list.\n\n\nI've never seen only one main being offered, surely there would've been a choice?", "I don't agree with the bride, she wasn't bothered to accommodate OP's needs, but the way OP went about it when she was already specifically told not to do it seems also disrespectful to me. They are both in the wrong here.", "\"Starve?\" Lol. How damn long IS this wedding?", "What I want to know is how come it was okay for family members to be hanging out in the kitchen gossiping about guests but it was not okay for Opie to step out and have a few bites? Doesn't make any sense I'd be mad at the relatives who are purposely trying to stir trouble on My Day. Not someone who was hungry who just wanted to eat.", "She had a salad there which isn\u2019t enough & again, you expected her to starve when her so called friend could\u2019ve put something on there for her KNOWING that she a vegetarian", "Yeah, there was this one side salad and I did eat it during the reception to not to seem rude with declining the entire food offering.

I medically can\u2019t go that long without food, and due to my laundry list of allergies, it\u2019s safer if I\u2019m the one who makes my food unless there\u2019s a dedicated allergy kitchen.
