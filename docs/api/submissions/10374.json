It is 100% okay to want your own ring. I hope your SO agrees with you and plans to buy you one.

Not a good omen for the future", "NTA.  Wedding rings are such personal items and you should have rings you want, and can pay for yourselves.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want a hand me down ring form a broken marriage, no matter who it was from.  the Trick will be telling her in the sweetest way possible that you appreciate the gesture but you and your fianc\u00e9 want to choose your own rings.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo thank them, and tell them you have other plans. A nice gesture - But not a big thing if you decline.", "NTA Tell them honestly \u201cweddding rings from couples that didn\u2019t work out are terrible omens for a wedding that it will end the same way.

My old engagement and wedding rings have small stones and a large stone.   I've designed a new setting that makes me happy.", "NTA, as these heirloom rings are always a minefield later on if divorce is mentioned. Alternatively, you can do that, tell her that of course you'll take the ring, then put the ring somewhere safe, and use a silicon ring or something equally cheap as a placeholder, as there is no way you want to damage a family heirloom with wear, tear and rust, but still want to show commitment on a daily basis.", "NTA. I would want to pick my own rings, and I also wouldn\u2019t want the rings from a marriage that didn\u2019t last!", "NTA. I'm not sure I'd want rings from a marriage that didn't work out, but whatever your reason, I think it's fair to decline them. Also, to me it's weird that she **told** you she was giving you the rings instead of offering the rings to you.", "NTA-  it\u2019s ok, just be gracious in how you decline their offer.  Also, talk to your fianc\u00e9.  You can always get a new ring later, just a suggestion.", "NTA-tell your fiance that this bothers you. My husband suggests that maybe you could consider using the stones from the rings into a new ring? But don\u2019t do it if it doesn\u2019t make you both happy.", "NTA for wanting your ring in your style, not one associated with divorce. \n\nThat being said, I see you said she doesn't care what happens to them. You can have the gem set into a pendant (my mom did the same), save them for future kids, or melt them. I think it is a kind gesture on MIL's part.", "NTA\n\nIt's one thing to have rings handed down to you from a long, loving relationship. But to be given rings from a failed relationship? Yeah, that doesn't bode well at all!", "NTA. Your wedding, you get to pick your ring.", "NTA. The idea of wearing the wedding rings of a divorced couple just feels yucky to me.", "NAH. It would be wise to find out whether the rings are gifts or whether they have expectations attached. If there are expectations (do they expect you to wear them?) attached, decline them. If they are gifts, accept them, put them in a safe place and sell them once your in-laws have passed away.", "NTA just say thank you for the offer but you want your own ring", "NTA", "NTA, what does he want? Fianc\u00e9?", "INFO  \nYou can do whatever you want, but I feel like we're missing crucial information to judge this situation. Why do they want to pass their rings down? Is it a family tradition? How's your relationship with them? What are the reasons that you don't want the ring?", "How much of a tradition are we talking here. Is it an heirloom passed down from generation to generation or is this like a first time thing?", "Thank you!

Also, I feel weddingrings are something very personal", "Thank you so much for your comment. I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my fianc\u00e9 about this\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure the ring will fit\u2026 it will probably just end up in a box. (Safe of course because I would never want to lose or damage the ring) but again I\u2019m not going to wear it.

My MIL said we can do whatever we want with them.", "He doesn\u2019t seem to be thinking too deeply into it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s deeply honoured, I think he\u2019s thankful. He will wear his dads ring if it fits\u2026", "They want to pass down the ring as a kind gesture. Partially due to tradition I believe. My relationship with them is stable, it\u2019s good. We can talk and I feel comfortable talking to them, my MIL and I do things together too. I don\u2019t want the ring partially because they\u2019re divorced, my parents don\u2019t approve of them giving the ring to me, my parents think it\u2019s really weird. Also, I just want my own ring..", "This is a first time thing..", "You could dip them in holy water or have some other \"cleansing ritual\" performed.  I know that sounds a bit odd, but it couldn't hurt.", "Probably because it's a beautiful and valuable ring and \"omens\" aren't a real thing.", "It\u2019s all about the bling.", "I, too, didn\u2019t want a \u201cdivorce\u201d ring. But then again, it\u2019s not like diamonds don\u2019t have their own shitty history just by existing especially in the 80s and 90s. Are there stones you could save?\n\nMy MIL gave me her (divorced) wedding ring because it was inlaid with diamonds. Not the size I was going for for a \u201cdelicate\u201d band, but they turned into a beautiful pendant for my wedding gift. She had a random largish loose stone inherited from her (ex) MIL, and that became the main stone of my wedding ring\u2026. The metal, the settings, the design were decided by us, but the stones (which were essentially blood diamonds to begin with) got repurposed.", "If you are thinking of having children, you could give the rings to one of them as a family heirloom on some non romantic significant occasion, eg graduation, 21st birthday", "Welcome!", "Then NTA\n\nAlthough I don't think your parents should have any say in this. It's especially weird if *your* parents try to decide what *his* parents are or aren't supposed to do. It's your wedding and only about what you and your fianc\u00e9 want.", "Then don't sweat it too much. NTA for a first time. Now if it had been passed down for generations that would be a while different story as then it would be seen as disrespectful to the family and opened up a can of worms for you. But for first time, just politely decline key word here is politely.", "Thank you for this suggestion", "Also there is a subset of the British public who basically venerate Diana and if they found out Kate had declined that ring they'd have been on the warpath", "Thank you\u2019 yeah that\u2019s another thing she suggested was to hand it down to my future child.", "You could have them melted down and redesigned.\n\nNTA."]}
