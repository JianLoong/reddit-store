It\u2019s your room and you pay for it, tell them to have their friends sleep in the basement.

My dad put his house on the market and offered me a discount if I were to purchase it - so I went ahead and did that.

To be frank, I'm of the mindset that a 26 year old adult living with their parents is an untenable situation to begin with.  It can be done in the short term if finances require it (and the specifics of who is receiving who's help strongly influences the dynamics), but if you have the money to live on your own or with roommates you should be doing it at this point.\n\nSo my take is that whoever spearheaded the situation where a 26 year old was still living with their parents is the asshole here.", "NTA.

Move out already! You don't want to have never lived on your own!

You are old enough to be living on your own, so move out. Do you own your bed/bedroom furniture? If you do, you should be taking them with you. Why make it easier for your parents when they are kicking you out of a room that you pay for.

You\u2019re allowing them to make this about them. You are 26 and fully capable and financially secure enough to leave. I mean it\u2019s convenient for them to get rent from a room they would otherwise get nothing out of but you can\u2019t do that forever and it\u2019s not your responsibility too.
