You\u2019ve spent 8yrs there you didn\u2019t have to spend, but did to keep the peace. You aren\u2019t being argumentative; by all legal rights, you are a tenant, and have the same rights to space and privacy as any other renter would have. They want you to vacate your living space, still provide rent/groceries/chores, and not compensate you as a legal renter for the disturbance. Does that sound like something a landlord can legally do? It isn\u2019t. \n\nGet yourself your own place. You\u2019re in your mid twenties. You\u2019ll be the only one deciding what the rules are, what it looks like, when you do things. \n\nAnd do not give them a spare key. Don\u2019t fall for the trap in a month or so about how they need financial help. Don\u2019t fall for them supposedly going bankrupt and needing you to move back to make ends meet. Don\u2019t allow daily visits. All of these are common outcomes of this situation, and lead to your rights to your own space being trampled on.", "NTA\n\nThey have no business charging your rent for a room you don't even get to live in for a month. That month should be free.\n\nMove out. They want you there so they can control you and make it seem like they're doing you a favor, not the other way around.", "NTA. Your parents are essentially stealing from you, as I see it. They are accepting money from you in return for a service they aren\u2019t providing - sole access to the space for which you are paying. Of course they don\u2019t want you to move out. You supplement their income with rent, paying for groceries, and performing maid service for free. They are using guilt and shaming to trap you.", "NTA. It's your place, your rules.", "NTA - go forth and live your life", "Just move out. Why are you second guessing it? Your life will significantly change (for the better) once you\u2019re out from under your parents\u2019 thumb. \n\nNTA", "Nta. I wouldn't want strangers sleeping in my room, being in my private space w my belongings. You are on the top side of your 20s. Time to get to living. Living w parents can be great but there are also downsides. You have to both have boundaries & both have to respect them. One of the downsides to living at home w your parents is that they will always see you as their child, not a tenant. Which is how you get such an incredibly absurd request. But on the flip, its allowed you to save a great deal, be debt free & to not have to Pay a full rent/mortgage payment every month. To me, i think you would be better to move out & experience life before you get too old or married. Go have fun & enjoy it while you can (and be appreciative because not everyone gets an opportunity to live at home & bank their paychecks.", "MYA- you\u2019re 26 years old, you don\u2019t need their permission to do anything. Move out and enjoy your independence and the rest of your 20\u2019s.", "I think you should just move out.\n\nYou have the money and you are old enough to live on your own.\n\nI think your parents want the best of both worlds.  You will love with them, pay rent, help take care of them as they age, but they can banish you to an air mattress when needed.\n\nIt is not wrong for a 26 yr old to be on their own.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If you stay they might make you do extra chores for the guests and you won't be able to retort because if you do, they'll come at you for trying to humiliate them in front of the guests.", "NTA\n\nLove how your parents are trying to pick and choose which old country and new country ways they follow:\n\n1. Old country - Parents expect single female to stay at home with the parents (conveniently forgetting the old country tradition that the parents are supposed to pay for their daughter until she is safely married off to the husband whose supposed to take care of her).\n2. New country - Parents expect daughter to pay rent for living at home with them (conveniently forgetting the new country practice that a person paying rent for where they live cannot be moved around by their landlord for landlord's guests).\n3. You want to move out; you have the means to move out. So many posters who have parents like yours are sadly unable to afford a place of their own (parents don't let them earn enough money). Use this incident as the convenient impetus to make your move.\n4. Do not ask your parents for permission. Do what you want to do. If you can't quite buy right now; find the rental situation that fits you best. Make the move. Expect your parents to continue to complain and give you grief. You will want to get good at telling them your decisions are not up for discussion. Then you have to be willing to end the discussion if they don't let up (change the subject, hang up, walk away, leave).\n5. If your parents are likely to give you a lot of sustained pressure, you may want to look for a therapist you can talk things through with.", "NTA' move out!", "It\u2019s time.", "NTA.  Because you pay rent you are a renter like anyone else with the same rights as everyone else, regardless of the fact the landlord is your parents.", "NTA, at 26 it's perfectly reasonable to have a place of your own, especially if the room you're renting is going to be unavailable for a sustained period of time.", "26 years old. Financially independent.

It\u2019s also very unfair of them to expect you to pay for a room that you can\u2019t even stay in! You are able to move out and you really should. Someone else mentioned that your 20\u2019s are not long enough and they are so right. Get out there and live and let your parents figure out their own stuff. Their treatment is not acceptable and I don\u2019t know why they are guilting you about moving out other than that they want your money! NTA at all.", "NTA.  Don't argue, don't ask permission, don't try to convince them of anything, just go and get your own place.  Living with your parents at 26 is not healthy.", "yeah, just move out. nta", "Wow, I hope they weren\u2019t expecting you to still pay rent for that room you weren\u2019t going to be able to occupy.\n\nNTA, sounds like you need to let them have the room they\u2019re effectively kicking you out of.", "NTA buy the condo and move out. If they have asked you to move out of the room for the month, you should not have to pay rent for it.\n\nBut beside that, buy the condo and start life away from your parents", "Getting ur own place is the best thing you can do for yourself. Regardless of these events.", "NTA. You should just move out. You don't have to ask for their permission. From their attitudes you are being bamboozled and treated like a pushover.", "Wait.

Visit on weekends.", "NTA\n\nI think you should move out immediately. You stay for their benefit and pay rent. How are they now relegating you to sleep on an inflatable mattress in the basement. That is totally unacceptable unless you offered it to them.", "NTA.  If you are paying rent for the room, it is not a guest room.  You don't owe them rent for when their guests are using it.\n\nAlso, move out.  It sounds like it is time.", "NTA.\n\nPack up now and enjoy the new space you've saved up for.", "NTA, I don't understand why wanting to move out would make you an A no matter what the reason?", "NTA\n\nIf you were living rent free then I could see how they might make a case.... but if you're paying rent? Heck no.\n\nMy only qualm here? \n\n\\> I F26 have only been living with them because they insist.\n\nYou're an adult, \"no\" is a complete sentence.

Go enjoy living for you!", "NTA exactly but you clearly need to move out. You are 26, your parents have not been able to force you to live with them for 8 years now at least. You have been continuously making the choice to do so. There may have been different reasons at different times for this choice, but it was absolutely a choice that you made for yourself.

It sounds a lot like your parents are simultaneously infantilising you and financially using you to prop up their lifestyle.\n\nYou have the funds to move out and you\u2019re 26, there\u2019s literally no reason for this situation to continue and zero reason for you to stay in the basement on an inflatable mattress for a month- go live your life!", "Yep, NTA. I left my parent's at 27 (for various reasons such as in our culture it's not really a thing to move out as soon as you turn sixteen, plus I was working to pay for my undergrad degree while at school, plus they're in theyre in their sixties so Im glad I was there to help with house chores, plus they still cooked and made groceries as if my three other sisters lived with us (I mean, someone had to eat that food right?), plus I would never ever ever be kicked out of my room like that and they never made me pay rent!)", "Coming home and shedding nearly all of my clothing is the best feeling in the world for me.

Leases are just for people who don't want to stick with the state's rules and want to make their own.\n\nHowever, it might be a little different than people are imagining, because the rules for renting a room in your own home are different from the rules for renting an apartment.

Stayed at my parents home until I married. My brother is in his 20s and still lives with our parents because hes not married. My sister is finishing up college and is living at home. All of us lived at home rent free. I don't think my parents ever even considered making us pay rent. It's such a weird concept", "Exactly.

I immediately chose 28 and to my shock I was in the minority. Many went for 18 while some chose 8. I can accept 8 because of the total lack of responsibilities but 28 is far superior to 18.\n\nFYI because it's important, I'm from Germany. At 16 you are allowed to drink beer and smoke cigarettes. At 18 you are allowed to drink every alcoholic beverage.", "DAMN you guys are lucky. I had to pay rent while living with my parents. So I never really got to save up for those years.....
