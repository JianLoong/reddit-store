They didn't give the money back, but i didn't ask for or want it. That $100 covered all the food, water, electric and, my add-on, the inconvenience fee of never changing my room on the off chance i might need it lol ( hell my dad worked from home at one point and still didn't commendere my room for an office, he worked out of his shed so i could have a room jic ).
