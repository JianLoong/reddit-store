If she going to break up with and block you, it's because she NO LONGER like you, or not like you enough. \n\nYTA. You don't need to drag another person to get upset over fictious you yourself invented.", "YTA. You made up a hypothetical situation and got angry that your gf has a policy about exes that would apply to you if you broke up.", "YTA yes sometimes friendship works most of the time it doesn't and honestly unless you gave kids together there is no real reason to keep intouch with your ex,  you do don't get to ve butt hurt over a hypothetical because you think you should be the exception to her rule", "YTA, if she breaks up with you, u will become an ex and thus be blocked. She might have had something 'special' with her other bfs and still she blocked hem, so yh", "So you wanted to play the \"but I'm special\" card and it backfired.  You sound like you would be worse than her ex's that just wanted to stay friends.  YTA.", "Yta, did you just want to start a fight? You know how she is with her exs and you still got butt hurt from her answer. Grow up.", "Hey it\u2019s fine, keep obsessing over this and you\u2019ll get treated like an ex ASAP\n\nYTA", "How is this making sense to anyone? She tells you exactly what her SOP for break ups is and you appreciate her for it. Then for no objectively good reason, you ask her if the SOP applies to you, when it obviously should, you get offended that it does?\nYTA, man. Stop worrying a out hypotheticals and focus on enjoying the time you've got with this girl. You might one day become more meaningful to her than her principles, but you aren't there yet and if you keep on behaving like an entitled brat, you'll never get there.", "YTA.  Why are you trying to claim some sort of lifetime ownership over this woman?  Why do you think, if you break up, you're still owed her time, attention, and emotional energy?

Also, OP gave a hypothetical where he could break up and still have a Plan B to string along for years.....\n\nOP hurt his own feelings...", "I literally saw the surprised Pikachu face in my head when I read that bit. like wow man, are you also surprised when you touch water and wind up wet?", "If I had something special with someone, I wouldn't see that as a problem, because I wouldn't see us breaking up.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
