When finding out she was pregnant I didn't have an opinion since I believced she would be moving out and my room would become my own.\nShe did not move out and has been planning her baby shower to be in the middle of december since she is due in january of next year. I was in shock because we barely have enough room in our home with 5 of us including myself.\nSo how could we shelter another kid? I voiced my opinion to my mom because Angela and I have never gotten along. My mom said we would just keep her kid in my room which I found completely unfair as I would have to share a room with her and her kid too now. My room is fairly small and our two beds take up all the room.\nI was just confused on where we had the space for this kid and the money. Angela is also unemployed and lives off my parents. She sometimes helps around the house but uses the excuse she is pregnant to not do work.\n\nBecause of this I have been upset and I my other sister Ruby (28F) was upset at first but now is helping plan this baby shower. I have fully expressed I do not wish to attend and have a get together that day anyways with some friends. I\u2019ve received backlash from my mom and Angela that it\u2019s not the kids fault and I should be there for Angela.\n My dad doesn\u2019t support this pregnancy either but is slowly helping out Angela, and for my sister Ruby she is neutral. She is attending the baby shower but understands why I can not be there. So AITA??\n\nedit: To those asking about where the father of the kid is, he is not involved in Angela\u2019s life. He didn\u2019t support the pregnancy and my parents dislike him because he doesn\u2019t can\u2019t support my sister financially or took any responsibility when he found out she was pregnant. And Ruby does still live with us as well but she is employed and pays a good chunk of the bills. Her and my dad pay the bills. And as of where I have been sleeping, I have been sleeping in Ruby\u2019s room having to share a bed with her. (her room is noticeably smaller then mine) ", "created_utc": 1698617819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17je7tw/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_sisters_baby/", "score": 430, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are thinking small here, little friend. You should go to the shower.

It's difficult because of your age.\n\nYou probably need to do everything you can to move out.  Get a part time job (save all that money) and get really good grades so you can get a full scholarship somewhere (preferably in another state).  You may need to spend most of your time outside of the house.  You're either at school, at work or at the library.\n\nDo you have good friends?  Do they have the capacity to let you stay with them for a while.  Someone may be happy to house you till you finish high school.\n\nCan you speak to a teacher at school about your situation?\n\nAt minimum, I'd be doing no child care on a regular basis.  There's a difference between minding the kid for an hour while they are asleep so mom can go to the shops v's you not being able to attend work/school or be left with the child for hours on end.  \n\nIf everyone leaves the house leaving you with the baby (and you either can't contact them or they refuse to come home), that would probably be a call to CPS saying you've been abandoned with your sister's baby and you don't know what to do.", "NTA but I would attend the baby shower and start telling people about this . There\u2019s only two ways this could go - 1) they kick you out of your room and if you protest they\u2019ll say you are being selfish. 2) and this is very much more the likely scenario- they will keep you in the same room so you can actively help sister with the baby. While helping is not a problem , people like your sister and mother will not hesitate to throw a lot of responsibility on you . You going to be the one changing the babies diaper , you\u2019ll need to babysit because \u2018sister deserves to go out and you don\u2019t know how hard having a baby is\u2019. You will have to sacrifice time and space and not only are they going to expect it from you , but they will come at you if you don\u2019t do it .They are not going to look out for your needs or consider your feelings in this situation at all.", "NTA if you don\u2019t attend, but I think you should as you\u2019ll never hear the end of it otherwise.\n\nDo not do child care. \n\nYou should talk with your school councillors. They may be able to advocate for you.", "Does Ruby have her own place and room for you ?", "If you don't already have one, you need to get a part-time job and start squirreling away cash to move out of that zoo as soon as you can.", "NTA and at 25yo she should have her shit together.", "25 time to\nPut on her big girl panties lol", "NTA.\n\nI get that this is an unplanned pregnancy, and pregnant mothers go through so much when expecting, but Angela really needs to start doing things to become a little more independent to provide for her child. It's nice that your parents are helping and supporting her and the baby financially, but she's still going to be the MOTHER, which means that she also has an obligation to take care of this child's financial needs.\n\nAnd it's not the fact that the baby itself is am inconvenience, it's Angela's and your family's inconsiderance that is. Especially because of the fact that it's already crowded at home and everyone will have to adjust with living with an infant until Angela decides to get another place for herself...if she even decides to.\n\nDefinitely see if you can find another family member or close friend to stay with because honestly, it's really unfair how your feelings are being brushed aside to accommodate Angela and you, like every teenager, need and deserve your own room and/or space.\n\nWith that being said (just to avoid drama) I would still go to the baby shower, but would stay for like 5 minutes and then go out.", "You would not be the asshole for not wanting to go, but I think you should just so it isn't held over your head for the rest of your life. You show up and then ignore everything while you are on your phone. Best of both worlds.", "look up those state laws\u2026it\u2019s laws that say what ages can and cannot share rooms and all of that print it and give it your parents\u2026give them a ultimatum figure out something with your daughter and her baby or I take it farther", "I'd say NTA for not wanting to go. Plus your complaints are valid about sharing the room. Especially at 16 with a newborn baby in the room that will surely be crying all throughout the night. Plus I'm sure the family will be expecting you (and other siblings) to help take care of the baby since \"Angela\" sounds a bit unmotivated at the moment.\n\nHowever, not to take away from what I just said or how you feel (because I do agree with you), the house is your parents and not yours. As much as it sucks, that's the reality you're stuck with. I'd see if you could find a way to switch rooms with someone else in the family? Or even try to live with a family member or friend. At the end of the day, it is their house and their rules, which is really unfortunate since you're a minor in school. And it's not your burden to bear that your sister is in her situation.\n\nAs for the baby shower, I'd go. Not in support of your sister if you don't want to, but to see if there would be someone willing to house you for a bit while the baby is small.\n\nI really feel for you and hope you can find a better situation. <3", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
