To mitigate their stress, my parents offered to host Thanksgiving, and my grandparents agreed, stating they just wanted our small family gathering - they would visit with others throughout the rest of the weekend.\n\nApparently, one of my aunts (50) who has been known to cause drama, threw a tantrum.

You want your elderly, immune compromised parents, one of whom is recovering from cancer, to host a big family get together that they don\u2019t want. You would prefer that they take on the pre-cleaning, the shopping, the cooking, the hosting, and the post-cleaning over enjoying themselves as guests.

It also sounds like you know which Aunt won't be invited to family gatherings after your grandparents pass.", "You are were hundred percent right", "You're NTA. At their ages, they have hosted enough family dinners. If your aunt wants another huge family gathering,  she needs to either host or make plans to rent a reception hall to accommodate everyone.\n\nI wouldn't fault the grandparents here. They're in weakened states and they're being bullied by a drama queen. They surely know there are only so many more holidays they can attend, so they're caving to her to avoid drama.", "NTA Your GPs are enablers and why they would back peddle is ridiculous. The holiday hasn't happened and can't be ruined.
