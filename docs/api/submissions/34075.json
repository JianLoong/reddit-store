It seems very strange to me that your boyfriend is jealous of your sibling relationship- a perfect normal and healthy, good thing to have. You need to tell your bf that it's actually a concern for you that he has a problem with your familial relationships.\n\nI feel like I've learned a lot about love, and this is one thing I'm certain on: you encourage and try to be part of healthy relationships, ESPECIALLY family. We humans treasure healthy family relationships so highly, and that and romantic relationships are what we value above all. The cool thing is you can basically get a second version of family with a romantic relationship. This is great for everyone- it's the most amazing thing when you can hang out with your or your partner's family for hours and both just bask really in this feeling of happiness and acceptance and love and family.\n\nSo people worry because they are concerned that it seems like he is starting to want to cut off familial love. This is something that happens in a lot of abusive relationships. If you see signs that this could be the case, run. It could also be your bf feels jealous for another reason. He might feel he wants to come first, or he might feel you have to split your affection or time. But of course- you don't have to split your affection, that's silly, and you don't have to split your time if you can have them start to have affection to each other too.\n\nTell him \"You are the only one I will be kissing on the lips! Since you are my partner, and I want you and my brother to have a relationship too, maybe you can hug him at midnight along with my cheek kiss! My two best guys! That would make me so happy!\"\n\nThis should make him happy, and encourage him to begin or strengthen a relationship with your brother, and become friends or even family. He doesn't HAVE to hug your brother, but this should let him know that you want him to be part of the family too. If he understands that, he shouldn't feel he has to compete, because he will be part of things too, and gain a lot also.\n\nThe only times I have felt jealous of my now husband's family were when I didn't feel like I was wanted too and it was me or them. Even then most the time I understood. But, my now husband started inviting me early to family stuff, and his family, and his Mom especially, always made me feel so included. This is the way. I love going to his family stuff. Just yesterday he rearranged plans because a family thing of mine came up last minute and he wanted to go.
