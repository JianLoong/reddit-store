He'd get awful rashes that took way too long to get better, and nothing we did helped much. Due to that, my husband and I decided to start potty training a bit early (right before he was 18 months old). We talked to his pediatrician and relied on cloth diapers as much as we could. After a few months of that, he'd almost grown out of his allergy, but we kept going.\n\nToday, he's fully potty trained. He has some (very) rare accidents, but only when he tries to delay his bathroom trips for too long. When that happens, we wash him up and replace his underwear.\n\nMy husband's mother was firmly against our decision to potty train our son early. She insisted that it would lead to IBS, and that he should wear diapers until he was at least three. She tried to convince us to change our minds for months, but we held our ground.\n\nIn early December, I had a doctor's appointment while my husband was at work, so I left our son with my MIL for a couple hours. Some time later, she called me and said my son had a (bathroom) accident. He hadn't had one in months. I instructed her on how to proceed, as well as where to find the spare clothes I'd packed for him.\n\nI picked him up about an hour later. On our way home, he complained about being \"itchy\". I didn't know why until I got him ready for bathtime later that night. He was wearing a diaper.\n\nHe didn't get any rashes, but the diaper was a couple sizes too small and he hadn't worn one in a long time, so I think that's where the itchiness came from. When I asked him about it, he confirmed my MIL had said he was \"still a baby\" and put him in the diaper.\n\nWhen my husband and I confronted her about it, she defended herself by saying his accident was clear proof we'd made a mistake by potty training him early, and he should go back to wearing diapers for the time being. At no point did she apologize.\n\nWe decided she was forbidden from babysitting, as well as spending time with our son unsupervised. She didn't think we were serious until we went to her place on Saturday. We had to go to the hospital, and rather than leaving our son with her, we took him with us.\n\nNow that she knows we're serious, she's calling us dramatic and ungrateful, as well as claiming we're alienating her from her grandchildren out of stubbornness. She maintains she was right about early potty training being a bad idea, and was only trying to help us.\n\nI don't think we're in the wrong, but this does feel a bit dramatic. My BIL, who was skeptical of our decision back in the day, thinks we're right to be angry, but it's still an overreaction to revoke her permission to babysit our son.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I feel the need to point out the diaper was clean when I removed it. Also, my son will be four years old in February.\n\nEDIT 2: MIL is not our only babysitting option.

It wasn't her place to go against your clear wishes and now she has to face the consequences. That's all that really matters here. Your son was not and is not in danger, you were working with his pediatrician on this, and her using one example of an accident as proof of her uninformed medical 'knowledge' is ridiculous. At ANY age, a child learning to use the potty will be prone to occasional accidents, and it doesn't mean you revert to diapers every time, obviously. It sounds like your MIL is unusually stubborn and has a classic case of 'I Know Better'. I think your boundary and consequence are perfectly appropriate. You aren't cutting her off from him so any alienation would be created by her.", "NTA\n\nNot only did she disrespect your parenting decision, she doubled-down, therefore you can\u2019t trust her to not do it again.

That\u2019s not alienation, by the way, she\u2019s just being dramatic and trying to guilt-trip you into changing your mind.", "NTA. Your son is literally almost 4 as you state in your edit. That's definitely not early for potty training. If anything what she's doing is regressive and going to harm him going forward. On top of that you have a medical reason and worked with his doctor to keep him out of diapers and she ignored all that. \n\nWhy did she have diapers on hand in the first place? \n\nShe seems weirdly obsessed with the fact you have a potty trained preschooler (which is age appropriate) and wildly uninformed about toddler health and how potty training works.", "NTA.\n\nTell your MIL this: it does not matter if she's right or not. It's not her child, and she doesn't get to overrule you. Ever.", "Your MIL is dead wrong about needing diapers until three. There is a sensitive period from 15-19 months for children to be interested in toilet learning.  She\u2019s overstepped and is finding out the consequences.", "NTA. She\u2019s clearly demonstrated that she cannot be trusted to watch him and respect your wishes or his allergy. \n\nWhat if\u2014god forbid\u2014he develops another allergy like to a food, and she decides you\u2019re \u201cmaking a mistake\u201d and feeds him his allergen? \n\nI\u2019d say maybe make it so she can \u201cearn\u201d your trust back, but I don\u2019t begin to know how beyond the first step being a very sincere apology on her part.", "Big fan of cloth diapers, used them on mine.\n\nSeems that MIL is making some decisions that feel like she is able to override your role as parent.   Is revoking baby sitting rights too harsh?   I dunno.    I mean, if say you revoked all baby sitting rights for letting your son watch Spongebob when you are a PBS-Kids only family,  I 'd say, yes too harsh.  In this case, I kinda shrug my shoulders, as I feel its less about putting your kid in a diaper and more about all the other stuff MIL is saying.\n\n1. Telling your 3 year old they are \"still a baby\", which feels a lot like a big overdose of shame for the kid for having an accident.  I'm sure he'll \"recover\" and will stop thinking about it  after 10 more minutes, but its pretty bullshit from MIL that she's all \"you are a shameful shameful boy!!!\"\n2. This is all wrapped up in some bizarre protest about your decision regarding when to potty train.  I mean... who gives a shit?  That there are so many strong and passionate opinions about this it is astonishing me.\n3. Not so much what MIL said, but also what she didn't say.  That she put a diaper on your kid.  Based on your description, she didn't even tell you she did this.   Obviously she was kinda hiding it but also planting it so you would discover later and lead to this sort of scenario.  It is also kinda unsafe the way she did it, not because of rashes,  but because of the tiny diaper had cut off circulation in his legs.\n\nIt would have been a completely different situation if a sem panicked MIL was like \"sorry he had an accident, I cleaned him up, and didn't have an extra pair of underwear so had to use a diaper\". or something like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnrelated,  I have to admit, I read your description of your son (\"Son (3M)\") as someone who was 3 months old.   So when you wrote \"he complained about being itchy\",  I was like ... \"what?\".   Still recovering from new years I guess.\n\nEDIT - NTA", "At three a child should be in the path to potty training anyway. You mil is disrespectful and judgemental. I can imagine she distracted LO until he had an accident just to prove a point. \n\nNTA.", "nta. even if he weren\u2019t allergic. putting a too small diaper on a kid while telling him he\u2019s still a baby seems aggressively unkind to me. putting a diaper on a kid because you don\u2019t agree with their potty training is massively overstepping, add in the allergy and if anything i\u2019d say you underreacted.", "NTA, ultimately it is your child and you have full control over who watches him and what they do to him while watching him regardless of who the babysitter is.  If the MIL won't follow your instructions for his care, then it is fine to take away her access.", "What if your kid had a peanut allergy, and she fed him peanut butter? Yes that could be lethal and this is just uncomfortable, but it\u2019s the bigger picture that matters. You, as parents, set boundaries for reasons. Your MIL did not respect that boundary because she believed that she knew better. She endangered your child. That\u2019s never ok. NTA.", "NTA. The only person being dramatic is her.", "NTA. Your MIL, wow. I've always (never ever) found the best way for people to like me after I've stuffed up is to call them names and abuse them.", "NTA!  It's not about the toilet training!  It's about her over-riding you and your husband's parenting decisions!  Which could have caused an allergic reaction.  That says explicitly \"I care more about being right than I care about respecting you as parents OR the physical well-being of my grandson.\" \n\nAs an aside, my mom mentioned that she had toilet trained all (5) of us at 18 months when my youngest was 18 months.  We toilet trained her.  It was extremely common before disposable diapers.", "NTA\n\nYou are the parents - she is not. She needs to get back in her own lane and respect the parenting choices you have made, especially as they were made due to an allergy.", "NTA. What does your MIL think people did before the days of diapers??? Obviously not everyone in ye olden days got IBS. Amazed at the sheer stupidity of people.", "NTA. What it boils down to is that he has an allergy, and she purposely exposed him to it. That\u2019s putting him at risk. You have to advocate for him, he has no one else. You\u2019re doing the right thing", "NTA. Some kids are ready as soon as they start walking. Some kids need patience and time. Unless they have other problems, every kid should be working on potty training before age 3. There's going to be accidents. That's just how it is. Your MIL is ridiculous. Crap like this just confuses kids and makes everything harder.", "This seems pretty simple to me. Your son actually has a medical issue and putting him in diapers can harm him. She knows this information but chooses to ignore it and replace it with her own layman opinions. I wouldn\u2019t let her watch my kid either.", "My goodness we had the opposite. I was told I should have pity trained at 18 months not 3.5 years.  NTA - if your MIL can't follow simple instructions due to an allergy what else is she doing that could put your son in danger. It's also a breach of trust.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you are right or wrong on the potty training - it is YOUR decision as his parents.  She doesn\u2019t have to like it or agree with it, but she does have to abide by it or she gets only supervised visits.  It\u2019s that simple.  NTA, not even a little.", "NTA\n\nMIL is the AH here.  She put a 3 year old in a diaper that is too small.   \nFact, young children have accidents.  When they do, you clean them up and change their clothes and move on. Not pull out a diaper, especially for a child who is allergic to disposable diapers.\n\nI had a child allergic to disposable diapers.  Not fun.  we did cloth diapering for that reason.  Cloth diapered children toilet train earlier in general, because the cloth means they feel it right away when they wet.  \n\nYou did fine.  Hopefully MIL will get over herself and apologize.", "A child's grandparents don't have any \"rights\" regarding their grandchildren, and this woman is not in any way entitled to spend time alone with your kid. She purposely went behind your back and against your stated parenting methods and made a decision that could have compromised your child's health for the sake of her own convenience. You're absolutely right to keep her from having unsupervised time with your child again. NTA.", "NTA - kids will have accidents until they are 6 or 7, when they are lost to some game and simply forget to go to toilet. But its funny. When I was a kid it was almost a topic for child protection when the kids where not potty trained afer 12 months (I am not US). Now its more or less 2 years. Depending in the development of the kid. Some kids are completly \"dry\", others need a daiper in the night for some more years. .....", "Not the AH !  Your MIL certainly is though.", "NTA.  Your MIL is infantilizing your son and disrespecting your parenting decisions.  She can have a wonderful relationship with your son without being his babysitter.  \n\nJust as an aside \u2026 my daughters were in preschool at age 3; when school started most of their classmates were either potty trained or were in the process of becoming potty trained.  By the end of of the year everyone was potty trained.  And yes, part of the process was peer pressure.  3 year olds want to be \u201cbig kids\u201d and don\u2019t want other children to think they are babies.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if your son has friends his own age, but what your MIL did would cause him considerable embarrassment among his peers.", "NTA and MIL doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries.

My mom or MIL would have never had the audacity to go against my wishes.", "NTA. If she can't treat your child how you see fit then she doesn't get to see him.

She's told me that she was taught to follow her children's cues as to potty training readiness with those cues beginning at around 18 months or so.  Mom was a SAHP when her kids were small, so she had the time to devote toward getting us potty trained as soon as we seemed to be ready for it. \n\nWhen my mom was raising children, it was considered to be unusual to have a child still in diapers full time after age three.  On the other hand, cloth diapers were still pretty mainstream when she was raising kids (mom only used disposable diapers on  us when camping or visiting grandparents), so I think that kids tended to be ready for starting training earlier than they are now because they could feel the discomfort of being wet in a standard pre-folded cloth diaper of the era. \n\nAnecdotally, I've babysat a fair bit over the years and noticed that the cloth diapered kids do seem to train a bit earlier than the ones who are exclusively in disposable diapers. The kids with older siblings seem to train earlier; the kids who aren't fully trained by preschool, seem to train really quickly once they're in school which makes me wonder if there's a slight peer pressure aspect when it comes to potty training under those circumstances. \n\nO.P.'s MIL overstepped big time on this one.", "IMO 1 year is kinda early.

Like so bad the diapers would disintegrate on his skin and the pieces would have to be pulled off with tweezers (or so my mom says).  The best guess is that since my mom used one of the services that washed the diapers for you is that he was more likely allergic to the chemicals the company was using to clean the diapers (mid 80\u2019s for reference). Anyways I didn\u2019t learn this until I was a teenager when after years of using these strange cloths for dusting my mother refers to it as a diaper.

Plus, many kids have the occasional accident well into grade school, but we don\u2019t put them in diapers just in case.\n\nI potty trained my daughter around age 2 and plan to do the same with my second, but I\u2019d probably do it earlier if I had the energy and discipline.", "Exactly!

The diaper services tend to nullify any environmental advantage to cloth, which is why we washed at home.   \n\nalso darn skippy on the \"strange cloths\".

As time went by, I have wondered if it wasn't so much an allergy as maybe one load of diapers didn't get rinsed thoroughly enough in the laundry...but I'll be 62 this year and I can't bring myself to buy even a sample size of Cheer to test my theory, even though I'm sure they've changed the formula since then...", " my best guess is to sunbleach them", "Amen to that sister.

Private, parochial, and charter schools can have that as a requirement, though.  I currently work at a Catholic PreK-8 school and kids aren't admitted into the PreK program if they're still in diapers (having accidents every once in a while is okay--many parents send extra clothes in for this reason)", "What's \"once in a while\"?

That is usually around a year and a half to two years. Once they start being able to say, 'I need to potty' and aren't being only directed to the toilet, that is when they start transitioning out of diapers.\n\nI've been told by niblings they get to wear big boy/ big girl pants, and they have proudly pulled off their jeans and pantsed themselves to show me their super cool underpants.\n\nKids usually don't mind early potty training because most people understand that tons of encouragement helps.

My son didn't start even trying to stand until 15 months. He figured out walking not too long after, but he reached all his milestones on a delay. He was born a premie, so he crawled, walked, talked, and potty trained really late. The speech didn't happen until after he was 2, and we put him into speech therapy. He has motor processing issues, so that made the potty training really difficult, and we struggled from 3 to 5 years old with it.
