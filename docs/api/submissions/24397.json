Also, she\u2019s 35, not 25, it\u2019s not that huge of an age difference. They are together and she is the mother of your younger sibling, have some respect and decorum. Furthermore, nothing in your story suggests she is a gold digger. She is the mother of his child, she is entitled to what is necessary to provide for that child. Also, Wills provide for afterborn children (born after the making of the Will), so unless he is specifically cut out of the Will, your brother is entitled to half, especially if he is still a minor when your dad passes. The estate will have to provide a family allowance payable to his mother to provide for his care, whether you like it or not. Honestly, I hope your dad marries her, it would be a good comeuppance for you\u2026.Here\u2019s some facts:\n\nNo matter what a Will says or what state you live in, surviving spouses have a huge amount of inheritance power and can very easily contest Wills, even with Prenups, especially if there is a minor child involved who would be entitled to a family allowance from the estate to provide for care. This is called \u201ctaking against the Will\u201d and under most statutes it provides a surviving spouse with a 1/3 of the estate, but some Courts will award more based on length of marriage and number of children. If your brothers an adult when your dad passes and his mother takes against the Will, they will each get 1/3. If he\u2019s a minor, his mother will take his 1/3 in trust for his care. Surviving spouses are also generally entitled to take the family home, especially if a minor child is involved, and vehicles up to a certain amount separate from their 1/3 share. In my state a surviving spouse can take vehicles and watercraft up to $60,000.00. This could be 1 vehicle or 5, separate from their share. Pensions also generally go to a surviving spouse, SS if the couple was married for more that 9 months\u2026..and dun dun dun\u2026.Life Insurance Policies, unless specifically dictated otherwise, but even then it can be contested by a surviving spouse in many cases.
