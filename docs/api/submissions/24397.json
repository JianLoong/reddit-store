He was dating this woman \"Laura\" for a couple of years and it worried me that she was just after his money. She's 35. My dad said he'd never marry or have anymore kids (besides me 24m) because he wants to leave everything to me.\n\nLast year dad texted me and said he had some good news about him and Laura. I thought they were going to get married and I was going to tell him to get a prenuptial to make sure our family money stays in the family.\n\nNo. He and Laura were going to have a baby. I told my dad he was gross for having a kid at 50 and now he's on the hook financially. He said he was thrilled to become a dad again. I told Laura she was disgusting for tricking my dad into becoming a dad and she's not getting any of his money when he dies. My dad has like 5 million in life insurance policies.\n\n\n\nShe said she was insulted by what I said and I said I call out gold diggers when I see them. Of course ever since my brother was born she keeps asking him to change his will. I told my dad she should get a job and not to try to live off him.\n\nEdit: My dad is worth more than his life insurance policies. I have a trust and get money every month and now I'm worried that Laura might expect one too. What if my dad dies and leaves everything to her and then she dies and leaves everything to her family? That means my family's money and property goes to a gold digger. Laura hasn't had a real job and she's pushing 40. That's sus af\n\nI'm trying to protect my family's legacy. This isn't about money. My dad gives me money every month.\n\nEdit: Actually I do work. I work for my dad by running errands and helping around the house.

Absolutely. But it\u2019s not like he\u2019s on deaths doorstep. I\u2019m 27 and have found men 50+ attractive. Would I date them? No probably not, but to each their own. Maybe I would if I was 35.

Why do you even care? And why do you think it\u2019s gross for a 50 year old to have a kid? I think you need an attitude adjustment. Of course she wants their child and herself reflected in the will, she will need support if something happens. That doesn\u2019t make her a gold digger, that makes her a responsible parent. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re upset that you now have to share HIS money when he passes.

And he'll do with it whatever he wants. \n\nIt's perfectly logical to expect the father of your child to protect that child financially in the event that he passes away, Laura isn't doing anything wrong by expecting your dad to include his youngest child in his will. She's not claiming anything for herself. You are. \n\nI think you need to take your own advice and focus on working (or getting a job if you don't have one) and make your own living instead of trying to live off an inheritance you are decades away from getting.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to dictate how your dad lives his life.

Also, she\u2019s 35, not 25, it\u2019s not that huge of an age difference. They are together and she is the mother of your younger sibling, have some respect and decorum. Furthermore, nothing in your story suggests she is a gold digger. She is the mother of his child, she is entitled to what is necessary to provide for that child. Also, Wills provide for afterborn children (born after the making of the Will), so unless he is specifically cut out of the Will, your brother is entitled to half, especially if he is still a minor when your dad passes. The estate will have to provide a family allowance payable to his mother to provide for his care, whether you like it or not. Honestly, I hope your dad marries her, it would be a good comeuppance for you\u2026.Here\u2019s some facts:\n\nNo matter what a Will says or what state you live in, surviving spouses have a huge amount of inheritance power and can very easily contest Wills, even with Prenups, especially if there is a minor child involved who would be entitled to a family allowance from the estate to provide for care. This is called \u201ctaking against the Will\u201d and under most statutes it provides a surviving spouse with a 1/3 of the estate, but some Courts will award more based on length of marriage and number of children. If your brothers an adult when your dad passes and his mother takes against the Will, they will each get 1/3. If he\u2019s a minor, his mother will take his 1/3 in trust for his care. Surviving spouses are also generally entitled to take the family home, especially if a minor child is involved, and vehicles up to a certain amount separate from their 1/3 share. In my state a surviving spouse can take vehicles and watercraft up to $60,000.00. This could be 1 vehicle or 5, separate from their share. Pensions also generally go to a surviving spouse, SS if the couple was married for more that 9 months\u2026..and dun dun dun\u2026.Life Insurance Policies, unless specifically dictated otherwise, but even then it can be contested by a surviving spouse in many cases.

I can't even get access to his ancestry account to copy the family tree stuff he did (still working on getting it, though...and I'll delete that cow the minute I do).\n\nYour dad can't see it because all of his thoughts are being processed by his netherbrain.

If he gave his reasons for staying single & keeping his wealth in the family. As a successful, relatively young man, women will come after you not for your character or personality, but for the $$, and the father has layed out those stances probably in full knowledge at how devastating the institution of state sanctioned theft and kidnapping (aka, marriage) to men. Women can manipulate men very easily and put on an act for a long time. The wealthier you are, the better actors and players at the game you attract.\n\n However the father is more than willing to make his own choices, and he will have to face the consequences of them if/when he fails (50+% of marriages end in 5 yrs or less, 80% divorce initiated by women, and child support +allemony payments go to women). \n\nOP: knows his father is successful and sees this new step-mom come in and try to change his father's stance on intentions in life. Love is love. If she truly cared about him trusted him and respected him, she should be more than OK with taking his word for a relationship. Why get the government involved? As mentioned above, there is no benefit in a man getting married in 2023, especially a successful one. Only reason to get government involved in 2023 is if you have alterior motives... Then step-mom doubles down and tries to get his father to change his will. Nothing says \"I love you\" like,  \"i want to legal contract allowing me to take half of your shit when you die.\n\nStep-mom: I'll assume the best case scenario, she loves his father for him, his character, morals, etc. She would he ride or die. If she is so sincere about it with her intent to get married, she shouldn't worry about who gets the assets In a divorce. She's with him for life, right...RIGHT?!?!?! Then she wants him the change his will so that even if she out lives him which is likely due to the age gap, she has the rest of her life secured and not having to work for it... anyone else smell that smoke?\n\nOp is NTA.
