They have been meaning to move in together for the last year but he has been in and out of jobs, got a puppy recently and just been living at his parents house and out of his savings. He is in no way financially dependent on her, he had a killer job before covid so he has a good savings. My sister was really tired of going back and forth between her apartment and his parents house. He had a lot of home issues and drama that seeped into their relationship and overall moving was the best choice for their relationship. He wanted more time than she could give with the back and forth so it made sense. \n\nFast forward to now and they\u2019ve been in this house maybe 3 weeks ish. I went over to work on christmas gifts. Shes giving me the tour and we are going over different decorating ideas. On her mantel, her boyfriend had a lot of things on display in a pile. Just funny boy things, like weapons, ghost hunting equipment, a lock of his friends hair which we both thought was odd to keep by the tv. \n\nWe both talked about how they could work to look more cohesive and how he would be able to best display his items because it looked kinda messy. He hasnt lived out of his parents in years so he doesnt have the decorating skills either of us have acquired or to even have the space to experiment. We both have experience as professional organizers and cleaners. And again not anything horrible was said expect that its weird to have your friends hair out in the open. Not saying his stuff was stupid, just interestingly placed. \n\nEventually we moved on, and the entire time he was outside listening to us from a Camera plugged in inside. He was supposed to go to his parents house when i arrived, and he purposely listened to us for 30-40 minutes. \n\nHe came in and turned the camera off, we both were a bit confused as to why he was still outside, she inquired why he looked so mad on the phone outside and he said it was nothing. \n\nI leave later and he comes home and starts this whole fight about how we dont respect him and how shes not the sweet girl he thought she was if she can talk shit behind his back. She really just said it\u2019s an adjustment period and we are finding our groove. Nothing negative at all. \n\nI dont feel like we did anything wrong, maybe a differing of opinions but if anything him listening to the private conversation, not even hearing everything we said correctly is wrong. \n\nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1702327851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g3ufo/aitah_for_critiquing_my_sisters_partners/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's no world where you're the asshole here. You and your sister are *allowed* to have private conversations.  I have conversations with MY sister, and I've never once thought \"oh my SO might be recording this\".  \n\n\nEven just having that camera there should have been a red flag.   \n\n\nMake no mistake- this was 100% intentional - he wanted to start a fight. He turned on that camera. Went outside. Loaded the app onto his phone. Listened in to your conversation for nearly 3/4 of an hour. Then came in like he was holier than thou.  That doesn't sound like a healthy, stable man to me.   \n\n\nI really hope your sister's safe...", "NTA:\n\n>he purposely listened to us for 30-40 minutes.\n\nYou should be able to express you opinion in private and not have the possibility of him spying on you. In some countries and states, listening in and recording on a conversation that you are not a part of is a crime. \n\nNot liking someones decorating choices is NOT a sign of disrespecting a person. This relationship and his person sound incredibly toxic. Your sister should seriously consider whether this is a relationship she wants to be in. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\n\nThis type of behavior spirals into abuse. Quickly. Please keep an eye on your sister. Her moving in with him puts her in a lot of potential danger.", "NTA and your sister should be very concerned about her safety and privacy. There is no way this is the first time he\u2019s spied on her and he\u2019ll continue to do it. I would not be surprised if he kept audio and video recordings of her to use against her or post somewhere.", "NTA, but this man is a walking \ud83d\udea9and your sis should strongly consider if this is the person for her. He spied on your private conversation and then told HER she\u2019s not the sweet person he thought? Mmmkay \n\nMy main concern though is the financial stuff. If he isn\u2019t financially stable and they live together long enough to become common law then she becomes financially liable for his debts. Depending where you live this may vary but once your common law separating becomes more complicated and if he has been unemployed and mooching off her then she could be held financially responsible for him and have to split her own assets to compensate for his shortcomings. They need to have a serious conversation about finances and his plans for work so she can see if they\u2019re on the same page about that stuff. \n\nAlso moving in together with someone you\u2019re already on rocky ground with isn\u2019t a great idea. That\u2019s not a good save-the-relationship move. It just further ties you together when you might not be a good fit (as it seems is the case here)", "NTA\n\nAll the background on their relationship is irrelevant. Eavesdropping over a camera is truly creepy.", "......

I don't have anything new to add but I think the more people that mention this the better. Intentionally saying he was leaving then staying behind to eavesdrop on your conversations through a camera that your sister apparently didn't even know was there is a HUGE red flag. She needs to carefully think about whether she wants to be in a relationship with someone so insecure they don't even trust her to be alone with her own sister.", "Your sister is in for a bad time.  For many reasons. \n\nShe should be worried. \n\nYou should be worried for her.", "Watch the conversation back and be open minded and see how he might think/feel about it. Then sis needs to talk with him. It would be great if he and sis sat down and watched it and discussed it", "So, buddy is 30 and a walking red flag. NTA and I would keep an eye out for how their relationship evolves", "Not listening in. That would be ludicrous. Every overheard conversation at a restaurant would be criminal. Just recording in most jurisdictions, but it depends where you are. In Canada for example it's not illegal to record a conversation without consent. And at least a handful of states."]}
