Animal bites should always be treated quickly for many reasons.  The first and most obvious is rabies. This is the single most deadly virus known to man. We have no cure for it, only a vaccine that needs quick application to prevent it and an extremely risky treatment called the Milwaukee protocol that jad had some success. To make it worse, by the time you exhibit symptoms, it is already too late. It literally kills hundreds, if not thousands of people every year. Second the old idiom of \"a dog's mouth is cleaner than a hukans\" is technically correct, dog's still cam carry nasty germs in their mouth. Infections suck and if left unchecked he can lose his leg. Lastly if it's and big and obvious as you stated, it needs stitches. Leaving open woulds alone is like asking the universe for a spanking, it will oblige you.

However, the cost of the rabies vaccine can be really expensive, especially if someone doesn\u2019t have insurance (according to the CDC, it averages almost $4,000).  And sure, it\u2019s easy to say from the outside \u201cwell, it\u2019s worth it if it saves  your life\u201d.\n\nBut you won\u2019t be the one financially responsible for the bill.  And if she can\u2019t afford to drop $4000 on a \u201cjust in case\u201d, it can seem\u2026 out of touch for someone else to imply she shouldn\u2019t worry about the cost.\n\nFor people without insurance, they *have* to worry about the cost.  They don\u2019t have the option not to.\n\nSource:  for many years of my life, I didn\u2019t have health insurance.  And nothing aggravated me more than people telling me to \u201cgo to the doctor\u201d when I literally couldn\u2019t afford it.  Because all those do-gooders certainly wouldn\u2019t be around when the bill came due.", "ESH doubtful rabies was the issue, more likely needed a tetanus shot or a doctor to wash the wound and check for contamination of some sort.", "In life, one should be able to look across a table at someone and say \"you damn fool, you're going to lose your leg if you don't see a doctor\"\n\nNTA\n\nI suspect it was her own dog or a family member's dog who bit her and she doesn't want it reported.
