You got caught fair and square. If your uncle does not want you to be sexually active, you can't be sexually active or at the very least you cannot use his home to make it easier for you to be sexually active. This he has every right and responsibility to do. If you sexual freedom, move out.", "ESH. While I understand their house so they have a right blah blah, it is questionable them going snooping (presuming everything you typed is true). I\u2019m mixed on this. \n\nOther side, you knew their beliefs and whether or not you had sex in their house, why would you even risk having that kind of stuff in the house? Just seems like you keep it in your car trunk or boyfriend\u2019s place or something. I lived with my grandparents for a year when I was 20. They could have hired people to toss my room like it was a prison cell inspection and I\u2019d have looked like an Angel.", "I feel like installing a lock on his door would get noticed real quick and his uncle would likely be pissed and just take the whole door away because \"it's his house\". But definitely try talking to your aunt OP. And hide your stuff where your alcohol is for now since it seems to be a good hiding spot.", "You trying to get him kicked out? He's entitled to his private life, but he also has to follow the rules of the house, or atleast pretend to. If he can't follow the rules he should leave. His aunt and uncle are doing him a favor.", "You dont know that. You're just pushing your own biases and opinions on the situation. Loads of people are opposed to straight people having premarital sex. It's a topic that comes up on AITA frequently.", "I am not having sex in his house though. I really don't see why it matters whether or not I am in the possession of condoms as long as I am not using them on his property", "Thats patriarchal bullshit. His genitals are not the uncle's property. He can have as much sex as he wants if he isnt using that house.\n\nIt was his room, a space his uncle gave him to store his belongings. That doesnt mean he is allowed to snoop and try to shame him for owning sex products.\n\nYour comment seems to be poorly hidden homophobia or at least puritanical nonsense.", "I actually already have a lock on the door, I just haven't felt the need to use it until now", "Actually if I were your uncle I'd be more concerned about the lube than the condoms, because that's an unmistakable sign of planned sexual activity. If your uncle is concerned equally about the condoms I think he's a hypocrite.\n\nThe idea is that you should be trying to avoid or limit being sexually active rather than making it easier to be sexually active (and yes, it is your uncle's business whether an unmarried youth dependent living in his home is sexually active ~~outside of~~ before marriage; it is not a morally good thing or even a morally indifferent thing). Of course, that kind of philosophy is how women from religious families would get pregnant, to say nothing of how HIV/AIDS continues to ravage the gay community, which is why it's currently considered unethical.", "That post was stunningly incoherent. But as for your opinion that premarital sex is wrong (the only option left after not good and not neutral), that\u2019s your opinion and it\u2019s not universally shared. The OP is a legal adult and entitled to be sexually active if he chooses.\n\nOP, I\u2019m going to put on my mom hat and say I\u2019m glad to know that you\u2019re using condoms and being responsible.\n\nWhen I sent my kid off to college I made sure they had condoms because I\u2019m not a moron and I wanted my kid to be safe and smart.\n\nWhile I think you\u2019re perfectly entitled to a sex life, you do need to take the practicalities into account. Perhaps your sex stuff needs to be as well-hidden as the alcohol. ( hope you\u2019re also being responsible about that! I used to tell my kid that I was not anti alcohol, (some) drugs or sex, but that they needed to make smart choices, taking into account potential physical, mental, emotional and legal repercussions. I\u2019ll skip the further details of the mom lecture, but *make smart choices! Don\u2019t screw up your life!)* Anyway, unless it\u2019s no big deal if your uncle throws you out, unless you have somewhere to go that would allow you to stay in school, be very, very discreet. You now know that your uncle snoops and should assume he\u2019s going to keep doing it.\n\nI hope this is your last year of high school and that you\u2019re headed somewhere else for college in the fall.", "You mention hiv and shit when he is obviously taking precautions to any stds. Hiv treatment is also more common and less stigmatized than it was. You are just being a bigot", "NTA. But you are living under his roof, his house his rules. Though your Uncle was super weird to go through your stuff. Anyway, lock the door all the time when you're out, or make sure to hide those things where your Uncle may not be able to find it.

We tell him that would be a violations his guests privacy and he said \"It's my house I can put cameras wherever I want\". I shuddered and felt afraid for all the people in that house especially his wife and female househelp. This uncle is giving me such vibes.", "rule 1 no safe sex here or anywhere else\n\nSeems a sensible rule\n\nGreat take /s", "It has nothing to do with patriarchy or homophobia. Sex before marriage is wrong. Sexual freedom and liberation does more harm than good. You either believe that or you don't, there's no need to be dismissive about it or make false accusations about it.", "The \"you will obey my rules under my roof\" attitude is patriarchal bullshit. It's an excuse for small men to micromanage the people living with them and invade their privacy. Being \"the head of the household\".\n\nIts reasonable to an extent, to obey the rules of the person who owns the house. Wanting to control your biological functions and violating your privacy goes far beyond what is reasonable. Sex is just sex. Stop obsessing about it and assigning it a moral controversy that it doesnt have.\n\nSo yeah, it's patriarchal bullshit. I also doubt his uncle or you would care that much if it were straight sex. So forgive me if your puritanical rant sounded suspiciously homophobic and I made false assumptions. But its just weird and creepy", "NTA but check your room to make sure he didn't install a hidden camera or something. Do you have any valuables stored there? Make sure they're still there. Keep all your most important paperwork and sentimental objects somewhere else, maybe your mom's house if they'd be safe there.", "op=nta\n\nstuff lying around WHILE also being hidden?  The cognitive dissonance here.\n\nBut since you need the place to stay, figure out where you can store your private stuff that does not \"offend\".    \n\nAs you know this was not an \"accidental\" find.  Laying a package on your desk/bed would not expose your stash.", "If the problem was \"No sex before marriage\" you've got a pretty good excuse for all of that stuff to specifically only be masterbation tools. As a gay teen that's all very plausible. Even the condom's part. Unless they're also weirdos against masterbation. If they are, tough shit sorry lol time to start hiding your sex stuff with the alcohol", "Tons of people are against premarital sex regardless of sexuality", "How are they doing him a favor? In any case, OP *was* respecting the rules of the house or \u201cat least pretend(ing) to\u201d: he had his stuff discreetly put away and does not have sex at his aunt and uncle\u2019s house.", "Being against it and then this level of snooping aren't the same. \n\nMy parents were no sex before marriage folks and they never went through my stuff looking for evidence I was doing it anyway.\n\nSorry but I still think uncle is more than likely a homophobic jerk.", "\"sex before marriage is wrong\"\n\nThat's your opinion based most likely on whatever religion you follow. Just realize that not everyone holds those same beliefs. \n\nUncle definitely out of line. This isn't a child. OP is an adult. You can't regulate another adults sex life. Especially when they aren't engaging in anything at the house.", "You're the type of crazy that shouldn't be giving other people advice"]}
