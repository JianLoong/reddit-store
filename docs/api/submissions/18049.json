{"id": 18049, "submission_id": "13q31e4", "title": "AITA for telling my bridesmaid to wear different shoes?", "selftext": "I got married this past weekend. One of my bridesmaids is a friend of mine from college. She almost didn\u2019t come to the wedding because she has been unemployed for several months. I really wanted her to be there, so I paid for her dress, shoes, lodging and transportation (I\u2019m had a destination wedding about 4.5 hours from where we live). She only agreed to be a part of the wedding after I told her I\u2019d cover all of her expenses. \n\nSo before the ceremony starts we take pictures in front of the venue and friend (let\u2019s call her A) arrives late because she overslept. No big deal because we are getting married at the hotel we are staying at. But then I notice that she does smell like weed and that she is also wearing checkered vans, bright green socks and not the beige heels that I bought her and that all my other bridesmaids are wearing. I ask her where her heels are and she says they are in her room and that she has a sensory problem and that they hurt her feet and doesn\u2019t want to wear them. I ask her nicely to at least just wear the heels for the pictures and ceremony and that she can wear her vans at the reception. She tells me that it\u2019s going to hurt her feet and cause a sensory overload and that she won\u2019t wear them and that no one will care and that she wants to be comfortable (note that this is the first time I am ever hearing about her having any kind of sensory problems or even possibly being on the spectrum) \n\nI then sigh and go, \u201cA, I\u2019m sorry but I want all of my bridesmaids to wear the same thing in our photos. The ceremony won\u2019t be super long either. Just for a little while.\u201d A gets irritated and goes \u201cI can\u2019t believe you won\u2019t accommodate me and my sensory issues.\u201d I go \u201cA, please? It\u2019s my wedding day. I\u2019m already nervous and I just want things to look nice\u201d \n\nShe then goes on a rant about how I don\u2019t care about her or her sensory issues, called me a control freak, a bitch and a bridezilla and then said that just because I paid for her dress, shoes, hotel etc doesn\u2019t mean that I get to control her and everything that she does. I tell her that I paid for all that because I wanted her here, but that it\u2019s my wedding and I want things a certain way, and that if she\u2019s not going to change her shoes then she can\u2019t be in our photos. \n\nShe called me a stuck up princess and said she was going back to her room. I thought maybe it was to change her shoes but instead she called her parents to buy her another train ticket and she went home. She came back outside and threw the heels on the ground and proceeded to call me ableist as fuck. She didn\u2019t attend the wedding.\n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684881041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q31e4/aita_for_telling_my_bridesmaid_to_wear_different/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where was her \"sensory issue\" when you were telling her you were paying for her shoes, outfit, etc.?

She was just being a jerk.", "NTA, and you dodged a bullet when she decided to go.

If she had problems wearing heels she should have told you that before so you could have a plan B. She sounds spoiled and annoying", "NTA.  I think it was a reasonable request with a good compromise, especially since she gave you absolutely no heads up that she might need alternate beige shoes that would go better with the dress.

Is she bat shit crazy?", "NTA, sensory issues, my ass. \n\nI find this bridal obsession with everything perfect weird, but once it was set and agreed and you paid for everything, she was definitely TA to make so much fuss about it.\n\nI get that heels were uncomfortable for her, but she could have resolved it in a million kinder ways.

If she had told you about her sensory issues before, you two could've either picked a pair of beige flats for her alone to wear, or could have scrapped the beige heels for everyone and picked a pair of shoes that wouldn't hurt anyone.", "NTA - this is a normal expectation for the bridesmaid role and if she couldn't do it cheerfully she should have just declined.   Instead everybody was put in an unpleasant situation and a lot of money was wasted", "NTA I have pretty bad sensory issues myself and I would I either take them off between photos or the more logical choice, tell the bride before hand.", "NTA. That person is NOT your friend and was incredibly selfish and rude to you. If someone pays for your room, dress, and tickets for a wedding, yes you show appreciation by participating as requested. You don\u2019t throw a huge temper tantrum. You are better off not having such selfishness in your life.", "Uhm major NTA. Idk if really has sensory issues or not but it seems more like she is lazy or possibly depressed. If it\u2019s the latter that still doesn\u2019t excuse the disrespect. If she had sensory issues she should have mentioned this when you got the shoes, because if that was true you could have maybe accommodated by getting something that you liked and also worked for her issues. Her waiting though makes me feel like her story is bs and she\u2019s doubling down because she doesn\u2019t want her feet to be mildly uncomfortable even just for a few pictures. If this was the case I don\u2019t get why she agreed to this anyway. But you\u2019re absolutely not wrong for wanting your pictures to look nice or for wanting a presentable bridal party during your wedding. That does not make you a bride-zilla. You\u2019re asking the bare minimum and she can\u2019t even give you that. If I were you I\u2019d terminate this friendship so fast and she wouldn\u2019t be in my wedding anymore. Even if it ruined plans etc. my sanity would be first and foremost here.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA Just. Wow. I\u2019m guessing that in your years of friendship, you\u2019ve seen her wear heels? I guess the job loss has hit her hard.", "NTA. If would have been one thing is she brought up the shoe issue before you bought them,\nSo maybe you could have compromised and got\nHer a flatter heel, but she didn\u2019t say a thing. The bright colors also tells me she was purposefully trying to make a scene.", "NTA at all.  But she\u2019s not your friend, she\u2019s using you.  I think you know it, too", "the audacity!!  and then the nerve to leave early after u spent ur $$ for her to be there...  i would be beyond pissed!!  \ud83e\udd2c", "I hope you bill her for everything & never talk to her again", "She\u2019s just angry, envious and bitter about her life. Broke, jobless, probably manless (or at least not one that is helping in any significant way) and self medicating. And there you were. Basically projecting the opposite of her life. Wearing those shoes and socks was her defiant middle finger to what she wants but doesn\u2019t have and refuses to admit she wants. I would bet she\u2019s depressed so maybe not a true raging AH but still a jerk.\n\nNTA. You sounded very gracious to her. And Congrats!", "NTA I\u2019ve been in her shoes and guess what, I asked the bride to approve flats well before the big day.", "INFO \n\nDid you pick out the shoes together and did she try them on? If so did she express discomfort then?", "ESH. \nWas she horrible to you, and completely irresponsible about letting you know her issues? Yes, of course. Her behavior was definitely inexcusable, there\u2019s no argument there. \n\n\nHowever, why anyone thinks it\u2019s okay to make your friends be in pain or uncomfortable for their wedding is beyond me. You could have done photos of everyone in bare feet, or just from the waist up, or had someone run to Payless for a pair of nude flats- yes, the timing was terrible, yes, she was rude and mean, but if she\u2019s someone you consider close enough to be a bridesmaid, why is the photo more important than the person?\nSeriously- she could have borrowed flats from another wedding guest for three photos and then gone barefoot- does it actually make a difference ten years from now?\n\nI understand wanting things to be perfect- but at what cost? I guess you decided a pair of shoes was more important than the person wearing them?\n\nI know I\u2019ll get downvoted for this, but despite the fact that your friend was definitely an AH, I have to say that the obsession with matching bridesmaids and perfect pictures and dictating people\u2019s wardrobes at weddings has cost people more friendships than it seems worth, and that\u2019s on the people imposing those standards. At some point the people and the relationships should be more important than what they\u2019re wearing in a photo.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
