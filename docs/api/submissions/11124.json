{"id": 11124, "submission_id": "11e4oz5", "title": "AITA for having cultural expectations of guests at my wedding", "selftext": "For context: I (28F) and my fianc\u00e9 (33M) are planning a wedding. I am of Asian descent and he is Caucasian. We plan on having two weddings - one in my hometown in Asia and the other in his country. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I talked about how weddings on our respective culture tend to go. As I am of Asian descent we tend to have a lot more traditions (eg dowry, Betrothal ceremony, tea ceremony) than a Caucasian wedding would. \n\nOne of the biggest thing is that in Asian weddings, it is the norm/expectation for guests to give money in envelopes instead of buying a present of the registry. The money also symbolis\u00e9s blessings for the couples future. For the tea giving ceremony, it is customary for both the elders of the bride and groom side to give money to the couple. \n\nI told my fianc\u00e9 that I\u2019m happy for guests to provide presents for the wedding in his country as it\u2019s a cultural norm. But I would like any guests coming to the one in Asia to follow the customs of giving money. My fianc\u00e9 is cool with this idea. \n\nHowever, we disagree on whether it is right to tell his family/friends attending the wedding in Asia to give us money instead of gifts. I recommended putting it in the invite but my fianc\u00e9 says that it is tacky to outright ask for money and I\u2019m being unreasonable. He wanted them to give money if they research on Asian traditions and happen to know that\u2019s the norm. We fought over this as I thought it was ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t tell guests at my wedding what the norms are if they are attending the one in Asia. I don\u2019t mind what they give for the wedding in his country but I wanted them to honour the traditions when they attend the one in Asia. AITA?\n\nEdit: adding information\nFor additional context we are only hosting nuclear family for both weddings. They won\u2019t be expected to provide us with 2 presents. For the guests, we are giving them the option to attend either the one in Asia or the one in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s country. So they won\u2019t be attending both and are not expected to provide two presents. A lot of my husband\u2019s friends from his country are keen on a destination wedding and would rather fly to Asia to attend the wedding than to do it in their country. For the guests in Asia, they are well aware of protocol so it\u2019s more for informing the people from my fianc\u00e9\u2019s country that this is cultural norm. Of course, if they don\u2019t end up giving money that\u2019s fine I just thought it might be good to let them know that\u2019s what tends to happy if you\u2019re attending an Asian wedding - that there are customs to be \u201cexpected\u201d so they\u2019re not blindsided when they see everyone in Asia giving money and they\u2019re not\n\nEdit 2: lots of great suggestions in the comments regarding useful links and a pamphlet explaining cultural traditions. Just to clarify I didn\u2019t mean to write on the invite \u201cgive me money for my wedding or fuck off\u201d. It would have been more along the lines of \u201cin Asia, guests customarily provide an envelope with money in it (the amount is completely up to you). This money symbolis\u00e9s blessings for the new couple (and explain more of the meaning). I love th\u00e9 idea of weaving that portion into the pamphlet so will suggest this to my fianc\u00e9\n\nEdit 3: this has been really good in terms of gaining perspective. I would urge those who label this as \u201ctacky\u201d - to not belittle cultural traditions that have been present for many centuries, just because it doesn\u2019t exist in your culture. Would you insist on bringing meat to a wedding where it\u2019s vegetarian? Would you dress like Kim kardashian to a wedding where you\u2019re expected to cover up and dress more conservative? Would you complain that you can\u2019t have alcohol in a religious wedding where alcohol is banned? Would you wear white to a wedding knowing that it\u2019s not custom for guests to wear that colour?

I had to show him YouTube videos and articles about what is what.", "Clash of cultures, one cultures expects cash gifts the other expects people not to explicitly ask for cash. How to resolve two cultures...perhaps it's in the wording?\n\nHow about wording it something like this in the invite to the western guests: \"Gifts are not necessary, nor expected, should you choose to you are welcome participate in our traditional gifting ceremony where each guest give an envelope with some currency in it. This symbolises....\"\n\nThis is going to happen a lot in your lives as your cultures are very different so it's best to keep an open mind and heart to both sides.

Both have the same goal of helping the new couple get a good start in married life. Marriage requires compromise.  This is one of the things you will have to work out together if you want a happy and successful marriage.    \n\nPresumably, only very close family will travel to Asia for your wedding there.  My suggestion is rather than include the expectation in the invite, talk to those family members and educate then about it and let them know it is important to you. \n\nKeep in mind though that traveling to Asia going to be a big expense, so any monetary gift will be smaller than otherwise, doubly so because there will be a second wedding and gift to buy. \n\nIf you haven't already, you need to sort out any other cultural differences.  Name change, how often you visit your families, religion, how children will be raised, how is money handled etc.", "NAH, but I honestly don\u2019t think it needs to be so complicated. There are some western weddings that also go the money in envelope route, it\u2019s called a \u201cwishing well\u201d - that\u2019s how we phrased it on our website when we got married (gifts not required or expected but if you\u2019re so inclined, we\u2019re having a wishing well instead of a gift registry) and we didn\u2019t receive any pushback or confusion from our family and friends.", "Honestly I would always prefer to be armed with correct information.

I was raised in an environment where even having a wedding registry is seen as rude, so asking for money from my relatives I did find quite difficult.\n\nWhat we ended up doing (and it worked really well!) was designing specific invites for my family and our other western friends that included a separate mini guide about wedding customs and what would happen on the day for our wedding in my husband's country. It included some of the common customs, dress codes and that sort of thing, so all our friends and my family would be aware what to do. We included the money thing in there, but we also wrote that they were welcome not to give money if they didn't want to. \n\nIn the end basically everyone got into it - and I heard from SO many family members afterwards that they preferred it to buying a gift because they didn't have to think about what to buy!", "Edit. Since you updated post. \n\nNAH. I think you both have good points and can find a fair compromise. Maybe listing a website with cultural norms to expect at the Asian wedding or providing some info.  I think the way it's phased for those not familiar with the norms is important as some people may be off put. With that said if I was traveling for any wedding I'd likely just give money  to make it easier for me. Just be prepared with which ever way you do it there may be someone who just gets you a physical gift anyway. \n\n\n\n\nInfo. Are the same people invited to both weddings ?

When my brother got married, wife is South American, he explained to his wife's family what our wedding traditions are with red envelop of money and they were all very excited about the whole thing and wanted to go through with all of it. SIL's siblings were the most excited about participating in our tradition. \n\nI believe, since your fiance is going to marry you and his family accepting of who you are, they should be open about your tradition and culture. It's not like it's some culty things.", "Can you frame the request in a way that you don't want to be given physical gifts when you will need to cart them back with you? Guests at the Asian wedding can either give money or buy something from the registry which will be sent to an address where you are planning to live so there will be hopefully no physical presents at the Asian wedding.", "NTA. I wish I was more surprised at how any people don't understand that something \u201cweird\u201c in one culture can be completely normal in another and vice versa. the commenters who call this tradition tacky are just narrow minded.

Don\u2019t make it complicated.", "\"No boxed gifts\" is common on wedding invitations.", "NAH\n\nLots of good suggestions about sending links describing the Asian wedding culture/what to expect. \n\nHowever, have you considered the expense of your family and friends travelling to your home country for the wedding? Flights, hotels, and outfits will add up to a lot, and people may not have much or even anything to give after that. Do you also expect a gift from the same people twice (if they attended both weddings)? I think that's a bit tacky... \ud83e\udd14", "NTA. You're absolutely obligated to inform your guests for any event of a protocol they might not be familiar with. I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't unless you purposely wanted to embarrass them.", "NTA - \"when in Rome\" argument.  Also, isn't it easier to travel to Asia with money than with a bulky, probably wrapped wedding present?", "Honestly in the modern day a financial contribution is more efficient and less wasteful than physical gifts.

You can tactfully include information about your native customs. \u201cPlease give money only\u201d wouldn\u2019t be tactful but an information packet on native customs would give people the proper information. Most people will want to embrace the customs and might be upset if you didn\u2019t provide them with that information. Nobody wants to look tacky.

Simply on what the update said. You aren\u2019t expecting double the gifts, just for traditions to be followed. And, there\u2019s no specified amount they have to give, so you\u2019re good.", "NTA. Simply point out that you will be unable to bring excess items home, and if after travelling all the way to Asia, if they still feel the need to bring a gift, that they might consider your cultural tradition of giving money.", "NAH. I am a white woman married to an Asian man. We only had one wedding ceremony but I understand what you mean by the red envelopes as gifts. However, this is definitely one of those culture clash moments. It is not wrong that you want money at your Asian wedding. That\u2019s the way it is done. I do think it is wrong to say it in the invitation that you expect money as it is traditional. People can get very offended when they are asked for money as wedding gifts. It can be considered really rude. I would talk to your future in-laws or someone on your husband-to-be\u2019s side of the family. Let them tell that side of the family what the cultural expectations are. If he has a best friend, I would tell them to spread it around the friend group. People are going to do what people do. If they give you a gift at your Asian wedding, so be it. It\u2019s alright. I might also suggest something written describing the entire process for people. Tell them what everything means and represents. You could mention the red envelopes so they know what they are. You don\u2019t include that you expect or demand people give them to you. This is a way to approach it without seeming like you are demanding money. Good luck. Blessing for your future.", "NAH\n\nI think it\u2019s fine to explain it as you\u2019ve laid out. You are doing it sensitively and letting people decide to partake in the tradition (I hope)\n\nThe tackiness is not the money or custom itself, it is telling people to give you money in an invite. So the issue is not the custom of giving money itself, it is how you are telling people about it whose traditions do not align with yours. I hope you are able to see why your fianc\u00e9e feels that way as the manner in which presents are requested is a huge custom in white weddings (or any white party that involves gifts, IE baby shower)\n\nRight or wrong those customs are there and that can cause friction amongst guests. \u201cMrs Manners\u201d, Martha Stewart, etc are examples of these customs", "Ive only been to aussie weddings and half of them asked for cash.

In fact I think most guests will be relieved not to have to shop for a gift, cash is a lot easier!\n\nEdit: Also, saying stuff like \"we don't do that in the West\" is nonsensical.
