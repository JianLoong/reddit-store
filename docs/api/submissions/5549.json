We were long distance for more than two years when I moved to be closer to him and my parents with my son who is now 8. The decision came after my son's dad left the country and stopped having any relationship or any contact with us. He dropped off the face of the planet from us. My husband is divorced and has an 11 year old son and a 9 year old daughter with his ex-wife. My husband's parents started playing favorites when they learned I was pregnant with mine and my husband's daughter. They would bring lavish gifts for my stepkids and would maybe bring something small for my son, but they mostly ignored him and the final straw was them being all theatrical over giving my stepkids gifts because their grandbabies were so special and rubbing it in my son's nose. My husband told them to leave and they were to leave us alone.\n\nMy husband's ex-wife, who never liked that he remarried, decided to maintain a very full relationship with my husband's parents and also allowed them to give gifts at her house. It became such a big deal that last year, and for the last two birthday's they had, it was mentioned around my son all the time. Not to mention she invites them to all my stepkids school plays and other activities, where they make a very big show of being very involved and loving and ignoring my son. It's also worth noting that they NEVER showed at this stuff before according to my husband, even when invited.\n\nAfter all he went through with his dad abandoning him, never having the interest of his paternal grandparents and then people who had been good to him at first, and who said he could call them grandma and grandpa, dismissing him in favor of bio grandkids, we were so worried about the harm that would come to him psychologically. So my parents asked us a few months ago if they could give my son an extra gift, a big, nice gift, away from my stepkids so he could feel extra loved and like he's not getting way less. My husband and I agreed.\n\nSomehow my ILs found out about the gift, and we're not sure how because even my son doesn't know yet and my parents don't know my ILs or ever see or contact them, but they said we can't complain about them and then allow the same to happen to their grandkids. They argued with my husband who told them to leave us alone and that we were not being cruel about it. Part of me still feels guilty though and worries they will tell my stepkids or make it an even bigger deal. They told my stepkids mom who sent my husband a text about it and said we're horrible people.\n\nAITA for allowing it?

Your IL's are not going to change and it might actually have an impact on the child. How much ever we argue ethically that we are just allowing the same behaviour let's not forget that it isn't something extra grand. Also, they are just kids! \n\nIs this going to cause drama? Yes!

Absolutely yes! \n\nI don't know what relationship the ex-wife and IL's have but it's clear they are there to make your and your husband's life difficult. \n\nThe gift thing might not just affect your child's view but also your stepkids view. So go with the subject very carefully with all the kids. Plus, the stepkids can still be manipulated further by your IL's and their ex-mom. \n\nThe best route would be to let your parents give the gift this one time since it was already decided. Use it as an example to explain why what your IL's are doing is wrong but be ready for them acting over the top. Talk personally to each of the kids to make sure they are loved and cared for no matter what. Your words and support matters to the child. Sometimes, even more than the gifts. \n\nI'd suggest to choose your battles wisely. The road could be tough ahead but remember you are tougher. I hope you the very best. Take care.", "NTA.

That\u2019s the part I can\u2019t make sense of- why they went from being accepting of their step-grandson to total alienation of their own son. \n\nAlso, how are your two step-kids behaving? Are they starting to pick up any of the behaviors of their mom or their dad\u2019s parents? Are the three children in therapy?

All I know is that staying connected to your in-laws will make your son feel worse when he starts catching onto their behavior. Also your husband isn\u2019t so innocent either he should have nipped this behavior in the butt when it first started especially if the other kids started rubbing everything in his your sons face. After all your son is now his son too since he married you. The man and his parents knew that you were bringing a kid into the marriage.", "Yikes, I\u2019m so sorry what a horrible position to be in. NTA, but you\u2019re right that this could unfortunately blow up in your face. You and your parents tried to do it the right way, away from your step children knowing. Someone leaked it and ruined it for you. I wouldn\u2019t give a flying fuck what your in laws or your husbands ex think, but if they tell your step kids and convince them they\u2019re being slighted you will have to give some sort of explanation. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, it seems there is no good solution and whatever you can do to make things better for your son puts a further division between him and the other two.", "So the step kids have 2 sets of grandparents and 3 parents giving them gifts while your son has 2 parents (including stepdad) and it sounds like just one set of grandparents. Given that disparity and the obvious favoritism, I think your parents were right to suggest what they did. \n\nGrowing up I just had my mom and her parents. My uncle married a peach of a lady with two kids who had an involved dad and two sets of grandparents. She laid into me when my grandparents gifted my sister and I an additional gift separately at Christmas.  I mean yelling at a 14 year old who recently went through really hard stuff that involved a recent nasty divorce among other things. So uncalled for and very selfish on her part given we didn't even show them what we got and it wasn't anything horribly expensive. Her kids never wanted for anything while we certainly did. I'm a well adjusted adult know but that and other related behavior from her still makes me angry. Especially since I know I wouldn't do that to a child in need.

Maybe even the step kids can learn from that eventually as well. \n\nOP is NTA obviously.", "NTA just like their grandparents are doing this his grandparents could do the same your husbands.

Your IL are horrible people. Let your grandparents get your son something special and get him something extra as well if you can. He deserves all the love and attention that you guys can give him.

Unfortunately your kid is not related to those people, and they don't see him as family.  Your parents are not related to your husband's kids he had before meeting you, so they probably don't see them as family.  People don't magically become \"family\" just because you decide to marry someone who has kids. None of them are even related. None of them took any vows, none of them got married or made any promises.  \n\nYou can't honestly expect people to treat kids who are family the same as kids who aren't. It's just not logical.

Any suggestions?", "But the step grandparents did make promises apparently, according to OP - they said the son could call them grandpa and grandpa, and said they'd treat him equally. They just didn't follow through. It doesn't sound like she's expecting equal treatment either, just for them to not outright ignore or be cruel to her son. \n\nOP also doesn't have the power to say no more gifts or recital invites. It's the bio mom doing that, and she has the right to both accept gifts and extend invites - it might be shitty, but it's not illegal to be an asshole.", "I love how you noted all the green flags it gave me\nJoy", "Exactly, OP, you need to figure that out.
