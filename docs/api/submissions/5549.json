We were long distance for more than two years when I moved to be closer to him and my parents with my son who is now 8. The decision came after my son's dad left the country and stopped having any relationship or any contact with us. He dropped off the face of the planet from us. My husband is divorced and has an 11 year old son and a 9 year old daughter with his ex-wife. My husband's parents started playing favorites when they learned I was pregnant with mine and my husband's daughter. They would bring lavish gifts for my stepkids and would maybe bring something small for my son, but they mostly ignored him and the final straw was them being all theatrical over giving my stepkids gifts because their grandbabies were so special and rubbing it in my son's nose. My husband told them to leave and they were to leave us alone.\n\nMy husband's ex-wife, who never liked that he remarried, decided to maintain a very full relationship with my husband's parents and also allowed them to give gifts at her house. It became such a big deal that last year, and for the last two birthday's they had, it was mentioned around my son all the time. Not to mention she invites them to all my stepkids school plays and other activities, where they make a very big show of being very involved and loving and ignoring my son. It's also worth noting that they NEVER showed at this stuff before according to my husband, even when invited.\n\nAfter all he went through with his dad abandoning him, never having the interest of his paternal grandparents and then people who had been good to him at first, and who said he could call them grandma and grandpa, dismissing him in favor of bio grandkids, we were so worried about the harm that would come to him psychologically. So my parents asked us a few months ago if they could give my son an extra gift, a big, nice gift, away from my stepkids so he could feel extra loved and like he's not getting way less. My husband and I agreed.\n\nSomehow my ILs found out about the gift, and we're not sure how because even my son doesn't know yet and my parents don't know my ILs or ever see or contact them, but they said we can't complain about them and then allow the same to happen to their grandkids. They argued with my husband who told them to leave us alone and that we were not being cruel about it. Part of me still feels guilty though and worries they will tell my stepkids or make it an even bigger deal. They told my stepkids mom who sent my husband a text about it and said we're horrible people.\n\nAITA for allowing it?

Your IL's are not going to change and it might actually have an impact on the child. How much ever we argue ethically that we are just allowing the same behaviour let's not forget that it isn't something extra grand. Also, they are just kids! \n\nIs this going to cause drama? Yes!

Absolutely yes! \n\nI don't know what relationship the ex-wife and IL's have but it's clear they are there to make your and your husband's life difficult. \n\nThe gift thing might not just affect your child's view but also your stepkids view. So go with the subject very carefully with all the kids. Plus, the stepkids can still be manipulated further by your IL's and their ex-mom. \n\nThe best route would be to let your parents give the gift this one time since it was already decided. Use it as an example to explain why what your IL's are doing is wrong but be ready for them acting over the top. Talk personally to each of the kids to make sure they are loved and cared for no matter what. Your words and support matters to the child. Sometimes, even more than the gifts. \n\nI'd suggest to choose your battles wisely. The road could be tough ahead but remember you are tougher. I hope you the very best. Take care.", "NTA.
