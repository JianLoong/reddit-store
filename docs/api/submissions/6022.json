He never says any hurtful words but I find his \"observations\" as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say \"oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though...\" or when he looks at my waist and says \"Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!\". Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.\n\n\n\nWe went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said \"I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!\". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!\". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an \"observation\" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.\n\n\n\nNow I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity.

I hope he has a minor injury that reduces his mobility just enough so he gains weight. He deserves to be shamed.", "Yeah, I was wondering if anyone at the table defended her, I would have, had I been there.", "Your hair used to be so full\u2026 not anymore though\n\nI didn\u2019t realize a back could get so hairy. I much preferred when it was hairless\n\nI didn\u2019t realize balls could get so saggy\n\nJust an observation, but you\u2019re getting really wrinkly these days \n\nIs it just me or is your penis getting smaller\n\nWow look at all those grey pubes you sprouted, old man! \n\nHey babe I could really use a beer could you pour me one from that keg you\u2019re smuggling under the shirt that used to look good on you", "Whole time reading that I kept saying heck no those are DIRECT insults. It's not passive. He is purposely saying these trying to cause harm and belittle her. My Dad did this to my mother for years. They divorced many moons ago but at 65 she is still so hard on herself because he drilled horrible things into her head about her body and how smart she is.", "Absolutely. The fact that she considers these very aggressively mean insults \"passive stuff\" is nuts, and a damn good indicator that he at least downplays his behavior.", "For real. I had a c/s with my first. I was a bit shy about my scar but told him no sex until he saw it and accepted it. He was like \u201comg that\u2019s nothing, it looks great, can we have sex now.\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Same. Currently 5 months with our first and I've already gained 30lbs. Not thrilled about that or how my body looks. If I make a negative comment about it, he shuts that down and compliments me and reminds me that I'm growing our child. He's not perfect, but he's pretty fantastic.", "Small d energy\u2026", "I just want to highlight this, OP:\n\n**He ruined Christmas because he couldn't allow that someone made you feel good about your looks, God forbid that he can't bully you into \"being hot enough for him again\".**\n\nThat\u2019s bizarre and controlling. I\u2019m sorry.", "He may not want op \"back to the way she was\", he may just want to kill her self-esteem so that she believes that she doesn't have a chance at happiness with someone else. Then the husband can treat her like some maid and she'll stay for the abuse becuse she believes that she has no one else and nowhere else to go.", "> I would absolutely chuck my sandal at their head.\n\nHigh-heeled, I hope, for maximum deterrent?", "The thing about this situation is it's almost certainly not getting better. A man whose wife goes through the physical trauma of birth and its lasting impacts on her body and all he can see is she isn't a hot 20yo anymore is not going to appreciate her physical sacrifices. He's not going to see it as something she did for him, to give birth to their child. He sees it as he lost his sexy living fleshlight and his breathing blow up doll got stretched out. He will almost inevitably leave her for someone half his age and tell all his buddies his wife \"let herself go\" and he deserved better.\n\nThere's no marriage left to save once the guys mentality stoops this low. Because he clearly doesn't respect the mother of his child at all.", "What did he expect would happen after she had his kid? That she\u2019d suddenly bounce back to being how she was before? Every female body is different and depending on how long ago the birth was and how healed OP\u2019s body is, her mental state  is another thing. OP, you were right to make that outburst since either he obviously knows what he\u2019s  doing and how it\u2019s effecting you\u2026.or he really made all those brainless comments like he thought it was perfectly natural", "Exactly this, there is no way the husband doesn't know this isn't hurtful, abusive and passive aggressive. He is definitely gas lighting her. OP look up gas lighting and different forms of abuse, signup for online group therapy and listen to other people's stories and you'll get some perspective.", "hopefully it falls off."]}
