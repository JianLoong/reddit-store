Beth has been part of the community for a little over 5 years. When I joined, Beth has been very \"distant\" towards me ever since finding out about my age and just kept our communications to the bare minimum . Everyone else has been very open and welcoming towards me.\n\nBeth is super nice to everyone else and she is super funny and really good at playing games and I really want to be her friend.\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw her in the discord call and I went in there and asked her why she has been so cold towards me. She told me \"You're 17 and in this discord is a bunch of people who are in their 30s and some close to their 40s. These aren't your \"friends\" and I don't find it right for you to be in here and that you should find friends that are more around your age\" She continued to tell me that she is just keeping my best interest at heart.  I guess during the heat of the moment I told her that she doesn't know shit about me and shouldn't be coming up with a decision based on my age. Beth didn't argue back and just told me that when I get older, I will understand.\n\nThis is where I think I might be TA. I went to the \"owner\" of the server and kinda told them what happened and they kicked Beth from the server because she wasn't \"welcoming enough\"\n\nBeth is getting a lot of backlash from some of the guys on the discord because of what happened. I dm'd her personally and asked if she was okay and she never responded to me. I still stand by what I said. I am old enough to make my own decisions and I really don't think I need someone to tell me what is good and what is bad.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit 1: I never expected the guys to dm her and give her so much shit for what happened. Beth was always very nice to me and told me that I should be careful with who I speak to on the internet (because they were all guys). I don't think I'm that young and that I should be able to decide who my friends are even if it is over the internet.", "created_utc": 1671497525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq9b2h/aita_for_causing_a_girl_to_get_kicked_out_of_a/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You acted exactly how an immature person that is too young to be on a certain discord would act. She is concerned about how young you are, bc that particular discord is full of grown men and she has probably had some uncomfortable situations herself that she thinks a young girl shouldn\u2019t have to deal with. 17 IS young and you will realize that soon. She wasn\u2019t mean to you. You pressed her about a question and she answered you. YTA", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m on a few gaming servers (mostly with friends from my uni days). I would not feel comfortable if a 17 year old girl joined one of those servers. I love my friends, but some of the stuff they talk about and the language they use. It\u2019s not for younger people. No matter how \u2018mature\u2019 they think they are. \n\nYou proved her point (as many others have pointed out) so congratulations I guess.", "YTA. I mean, you tried to push a friendship on her when she decided to stay away, then you went crying to an authority when she told you she thought you were too young. Which, you know, is exactly what a young person does, so she was right.\n\nI'm totally confused about why the discord would kick her for telling you she doesn't want to hang out with you, but that's on them.", "YTA, you asked a question and when you received and honest answer you got mad and ran to the adult men to protect you from mean old Beth. The problem is Beth is right, you reacted just how a teenager would getting mad and lashing out. You have zero business interacting on line with full grown men at your age.", "YTA\n\nConsidering that you're a 17 year old girl on a server with full grown adults, I would keep my distance too if I was Beth. You also had no right to even get her kicked out when she gave you the answer as to why she was distant.", "YTA.\n\nYou aren't owed her friendship. She doesn't want to talk to you, and she has a right to have that boundary. She's decided she's not comfortable being in regular communication with a minor.\n\nAnd then you come along and prove her right by throwing a tantrum, getting her kicked out, then *still* trying to talk to her after you got her thrown out of the group.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nYou asked Beth a question, and she gave you an honest answer.\n\nThat answer pissed you off, and in your immaturity, you got her kicked off the server.   Thus proving her point that you are too young and immature.\n\nYou should apologize profusely and ask the mods to put her back on the server, and then YOU should voluntarily leave it and find another one.", "And this is why I don\u2019t talk with the minors on the discord server I\u2019m in. I\u2019m polite, but I would never form a friendship with them. \n\nYou\u2019re immature. You\u2019re also not entitled to anyone\u2019s friendship. You asked, she responded, and you then went to go cry to daddy mod. Now she\u2019s booted and honestly, good for her. I hope Beth finds a new server and forgets about this old one. Y\u2019all sound toxic af. \n\nYTA, btw. \n\nOn a side note\u2014 those 30 year olds aren\u2019t your friends. You\u2019re 17. A 30 year old shouldn\u2019t be friends with a minor.", "So creepy with your sniveling \u201care you ok\u201d after instigating an attack on her. Ugh. You got the attention you wanted, but that wasn\u2019t enough?  Leave her alone. YTA.", "Sweetheart, as a 29 year old woman also with the discord friends and big into gaming\u2026 these guys kind of suck. I think the youngest person in my group is 21, and even that\u2019s pushing it. It\u2019s weird for 30 year olds to hang out with teenagers. Beth is right. You deserve to hang out with people your own age and form appropriate connections. I really hate to say this, but I don\u2019t think anything good will come from this group of men. DM if you want someone to talk, really I get it, but please back off from the situation for your own safety.", "YTA and as someone who was once in your shoes, one day you will become a Beth. \n\nYou will understand why she is acting like this. She has no obligation to speak to you. \n\nShe\u2019s right- The server is full of adults. You are not one. Why does a server full of 30/40 year olds feel the need to have a 17 year old included? What do you do that they couldn\u2019t possibly find within a group of ADULTS? Or at least a group of age-appropriate people. As someone who is in their 20s, I can\u2019t imagine hanging around teenagers. Something is suspicious.\n\nThat Discord server is not a safe space and Beth was being responsible.\n\nAnd on top of all of this, you tattled. You want to be in a group with big people but based on this story, you sound so immature. You are susceptible to them FAR more than you realize. If you realized, you wouldn\u2019t have typed this out to Reddit. A responsible moderator would have never let you into that server in the first place. \n\nYTA - Get out of that server and run like hell", "YTA- You pursued her and when you didn\u2019t like her answer, you complained about her.", "You basically told everyone to bully Beth. YTA", "YTA they kicked her off so they can more easily groom you, this is a terrible situation and she\u2019s right", "YTA. On one hand I feel badly for you because I had pretty much the same attitude as you when I was your age and Beth is right about what she said to you. On the other hand, it is very AH of you to stab Beth in the back like that. You are more dumb that assholish if you continue staying on that server though.", "YTA\n\nAnd dangerously nieve, you are hanging with a bunch of 30/40 men & you can't think why that might be a problem?\n\nBeth had been on the server for years and has probably heard them talk shit about women and girls a hundred times.", "YTA, not the matter of being too young but some people just arent comfortable being friends with minors. She has every right to decide who her friends are and you tried to push it and then threw a tanty when you didn't get your own way. You probably solidified why she doesn't befriend younger people.", "YTA. You asked her why she's cold to you, she answered, then you got her kicked out. THEN you had the audacity to ask if she's ok. YTA all around.", "If a significantly older person tells you that you\u2019re \u201cmature for your age\u201d and tries to involve you in mature discussions, that\u2019s a red flag. \n\n- A 27 year old.\n\nYTA", "YTA, because you\u2019re a dumb teenager, and it\u2019s okay, but like really you don\u2019t realise why they kicked the outspoken girl that says it might be creepy that a bunch of 30yo guys hang around a 17yo ? Yeah no, it smells like creep in here and she was right, I know creeps from Discord, I was in a Discord where they were all older and I was like 16-17, one of the guys that was LITERALLY A DAD, was saying how I was only a lesbian because \u201cI didn\u2019t have a good dick yet\u201d and some other guys were sexualising me, I didn\u2019t even understand that after maybe 1-2 years how creepy it was, obviously it\u2019s an extreme situation, but she was right and had your best interest at heart", "YTA. You are, in fact, that young, and Beth had your best interests at heart. They kicked Beth out because she wasn't taking their shit and they think you're a softer target. You're not entitled to friendship from someone who doesn't want to be your friend.", "You say Beth is:\n\n* super nice\n* really funny\n* really good at playing games\n* has an age boundary about people under 18\n\nYou:\n\n* are under 18\n* \u201creally\u201d want Beth as your friend\n* want Beth not to have her age boundary. \n* Don't understand boundaries.\n\nYou message Beth.

Maybe when you get older you\u2019ll understand that.\n\nYTA.  Stop private messaging her.

I will give you tips or answer questions but beyond that I won't interact with you.", "YTA she can choose her friends just like you can but she was looking out for you. You really don\u2019t find it even a little odd that all of these older men jumped on the chance to get the only person looking out for you kicked out? Even when she\u2019d been there for 5 whole years? It\u2019s very sketchy and honestly kind of creepy, which you are failing to realize (probably why she said what she said). But besides that, you\u2019re very immature and didn\u2019t even think before taking immediate action to get her kicked out. You may be old enough to make your own friends but let me just say, when grown ass adults are jumping at the chance to be friends with a minor there is usually something wrong with them and it should definitely raise red flags in your head.", "YTA, nobody FEELS young, but that doesn't mean you aren't. And it is VERY common in online spaces for younger people to be taken advantage of. Also, You Proved Her Right. You AREN'T mature enough to hang out at the grown up table, and your response to someone trying to help you out is to lash out and get them banned from a community they were part of for FIVE YEARS. Beth is better off without that server, or you, but you should try to fix your mistake. (And find a better community space, because this shows, again, that Beth Was Right, and the people in that group can be extremely harsh.)", "YtA, but you're too young and stupid to realize it. You'll thank Beth when you're her age.", "YTA, and the behavior of the guys who prioritize a 17 yo girl over a long time member of the community is a part of what Beth was warning you about.", "Oh Bun. I feel bad for how you're going to feel the moment it clicks that a group of grown men would never boot someone out of their group because she warned a child (and yes despite not liking it, that's exactly what you are), about being around them unless they have sinister intentions to begin with. \n\nShe actually did have your best interests at heart and you stabbed her in the back in favour of those creeps. \n\nSoft YTA because I mostly just feel bad for you. Good luck! \ud83c\udf38", "YTA of course they rounded on the girl that was protecting potential prey", "YTA, i was the same way at 17 and now i\u2019m 20 and i realize that i was being preyed on. a 17 year old should not be around middle aged men. she was protecting you. even though i\u2019m legally an adult i would still feel preyed on being \u2018friends\u2019 with men that age. they don\u2019t want a friendship from you", "You\u2019re really not as mature as you seem to think you are if you don\u2019t see anything concerning about a group of random 30-40 year old men \u201cbefriending\u201d an underage girl over the internet and \u201cbanning\u201d the one adult in the group who was warning you to be safe.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t so young you would realise that stable and healthy 30-40 year old adults are as developmentally different from you as you are from a newborn baby. Would you invite a random newborn baby to get involved with the humour and activities of people within your age group? Would that be a safe and healthy environment for them? Would you feel comfortable about someone your age who didn\u2019t see a problem including a newborn in that environment? How much more worried for the newborn\u2019s safety would you be if you raised concerns and they just blocked you from knowing what they were doing with the baby?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nAre you sure you were completely honest when you reported her? \n\nI\u2019m in my 30s. I would probably have told you the same thing. It seems like she was trying to look out for you.", "INFO: Why was Beth kicked out of the discord? \n\nIs it a rule that everyone has to be nice to everyone in the discord? Doesn't that mean that the person that kicked out Beth should now be kicked out?\n\nAnd even though you are almost an adult there is a difference between 18 and 25+, you are free to do whatever but don't overestimate yourself, she is right in ten years you will have more live experience and a different outlook than now.", "YTA. 17 is young and also naive enough to not understand why a bunch of older men want you in their server. I work with people as young as you and would never engage in friendship with them as the age gap is inappropriate but also there's not alot in common with someone that much younger. She was trying to look out for you and you took it as a personal slight as opposed to a grown woman being concerned about the online safety of a female minor.", "YTA, I see why you got upset but it was a over reaction to report her. I'm 34f I've been online gaming since I was 15 trust me it's not a good sign a bunch of 30/40 year old guys are so interested in you on discord. To be honest if they threw her away so quick though it might be doing her a favour to see their true colours.\n\nI'm not saying you're not mature and you're not a child. You might be a very mature person at 17 I certainly had to be but you haven't met as many creeps as I have at twice your age so don't know all the signs yet. I had guys in their 30s be overly friendly/flirty to me at 17-19 online which I look back and now see how messed up it was. \n\nI would be careful how much you hang out with these people and keep looking for other servers which are at least a mix of ages/genders. Servers which are pretty much all male are a bad sign as a young female trust me.", "YTA. I\u2019m around your age so truly, you\u2019re NOT mature enough to be talking to 30 year old men online. Like what else do you think 30 year old men are looking for when they\u2019re talking to you online, friendship?\ud83d\ude02 You should apologize to Beth.", "YTA. Does it not strike you as odd that \n\n>Beth is getting a lot of backlash from some of the guys\n\nOnly the guys.  The 30-40 y/o guys. Grown ass men.  And you're a 17 y/o child.  Seems like Beth really did have your best interests at heart. \n\nEven though she \"doesn't know shit\" about you.. guess what?  Beth was 17 y/o girl once upon a time.  And if you think 30-40 y/o men have changed any in that time period towards underaged girls? Beth knows more about you than you think,  little girl.  And about them,  too. Sometimes,  being a grown up means admitting when you don't know better than everyone else.", "YTA. You reacted like a teenager... Because you are one. Sorry but you are not mature.", "Why would you ask her if she was okay? When you are the reason she got kicked out? Two faced at its peak, and YTA", "The young never, ever think they are young until they realize it years later.  She was looking out for you, and you instead tattled on her like you were in middle school. \n\nYTA.  And I would back out of the server if I were you because you aren\u2019t mature enough to be on it, and the creep white knights are coming in full force\u2026 only proving Beth to be right.  \n\nBut you\u2019re gonna stick with it anyway, huh?  Because you think you\u2019re old enough and know better than all the grownups around you, right? Ugh. Grow up.", "So \n\nYou you joined a server, and almost immediately got someone kicked out because someone said/did something you didn\u2019t like? Even though they were looking out for their own well-being and yours??? \n\nYou effectively behaved like children do in school!!! \nYou joined an established group, you caused waves, you wanted to force a friendship on your terms only, then ran to mummy/daddy when it didn\u2019t go the way you wanted to try and get what you want. \n\nPretty sure that\u2019s the definition of being immature. \n\nYou may think you are an adult, you may think you can handle (in this case) this server with men in their 30/40\u2019s but the very fact you think you can just shows that you are, infact, a child. 17. \nYea \nYou know your the asshole, and because you feel guilty and know you fecked up, instead of doing the mature thing and removing yourself, apologising and leaving it at that without expectation of a reply afterwards from Beth, you ran to Reddit to find others to attempt to justify and make yourself feel better over it. \n\nYTA \n\nWhy ?\nWhy do you \u2018want\u2019 to stay in that server? \nWhy not a different one?\nWhat do you get from that one? \nWhat purpose does it give you?", "YTA", "YTA and I'm afraid you are showing a bit of ignorance of youth.

Before this she was never hostile with you or mean to you she just focused on other people. I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with someone 10 years younger than me either. You pushed her to tell you why she didn\u2019t want to be besties and you cried to the owner saying she was being mean and got her kicked from something she obviously had put a lot of time in.", "YTA. Beth is right. Why would you talk to a person who doesn't want to interact with a minor.", "YTA Beth was trying to help save you from learning a big lesson the hard way but you are insisting on the hard way. You and the others bullied her out then you have the nerve to act like you\u2019re so innocent with that \u201cu ok?\u201d. Get out of here. You failed this life lesson when you bullied someone who you even said was always nice to you. You think you have it all figured out, that you\u2019re \u201cmature\u201d for your age and aren\u2019t naive but you may look back one day and realize what an AH move this is and how naive you were. And hopefully your ignorance and arrogance will fall away and when that true realization moment comes you won\u2019t be in a crappy situation or went through crappy situations that could\u2019ve been avoided if you didn\u2019t let your ego get in the way of Beth\u2019s solid advice. \n\nAlso leave her alone. No one likes getting messages or harassed by a bully or someone who instigated a group to bully. Reflect on your AH behaviors and do better next time.", "YTA, she was never rude to you she was just trying to look out for you, but not in a very intrusive way. And she\u2019s right, if you\u2019re the only 17 year old in a discord with only 30-40 year old ppl it *is* easy for you to get taken advantage of. Besides all that, just because you\u2019re on the same server doesn\u2019t mean she needs to be your friend, why would you go crying to the authorities when you asked for the answer you didn\u2019t want to hear?

Your response was to tattle on her. \n\nPoint proved.", "YTA She was clearly uncomfortable with you being a minor and it's true, you should be careful around older people on the internet. I feel like that's something the older generation takes more seriously.", "As a 24F, I fully support what Beth said and did. I think the fact she\u2019s getting back lash from some of the guys prove they don\u2019t have the best intentions.   I get it if they don\u2019t agree with her, but they should understand her side as well if they\u2019re good adults. I also don\u2019t have much in common with 17 year olds (even if they\u2019re \u201cmature\u201d for their age) so i don\u2019t necessarily get excited about being their friend. And I\u2019m younger than beth! Look, many woman have experienced grooming and toxic relationships (whether platonic or not) from older people when we were online. When people warn the younger generation about becoming friends with much older people it\u2019s usually coming from experience. Listen to her OP!\n\nYTA and so are a lot of the guys in the discord\n\nEta: Beth has been in the group for a long time and is probably well aware that there are some creeps in there. Creeps who already try to prey on adult women, who would have a hay day with a minor. When I was younger I was so blind to red flags and didn\u2019t hold people accountable the way I do now", "YTA.

These 30-40 year old men won\u2019t necessarily have your best interests at heart, and grooming is a very serious thing. \n\nFor your own safety and protection I\u2019d probably try to have that conversation with you. \n\nShe was honest, told you she didn\u2019t want to be friends (let\u2019s face it - what 27 year old had friends 10 years younger?! Not that many). You couldn\u2019t take no for an answer from her, and decided to talk to I\u2019m assuming 30-40 year old men (who are interested in keeping you in the chat room) about how she wants you to be careful and maybe shouldn\u2019t be there? Of course they\u2019d kick her out. \n\nIt\u2019s a dangerous situation. Do the adults in your life (parents, caregivers, grandparents) know you are in a chat room with 30-40 year old men?

I can see her side completely, and I really think you need to reconsider your position in this chat room. \n\nYTA as she has now lost a place for her (as an adult who is safe in that environment) to be able to chat with others about a game that she enjoys.

Maybe all the guys there are cool and would never try to take advantage of someone young and possibly vulnerable. But, there is also a good chance that there is the potential for predatory behavior. And she was concerned about that.\n\nThird thing. Part of being mature is handling your business. You didn't like what she had to say, you escalated it into an argument and then you tattled when you didn't like the outcome. \n\nI'm going to repeat what Beth says. Be careful who you interact with on the internet. There are a lot of scary people out there.", "You keep saying you're not that young and all that. But darling, you are. You are not even a legal adult, and even 18 year olds are still young. If you don't want to take it from people who you believe to be old, take it from someone who's only 20. We're young. We might be on our way to become more adults, but I'm only a young adult, and you're still a teenager.\n\nFurther, your behaviour in trying to force a friendship because you think someone is cool is wrong and childish. I know why you do it, I've been there, trying to connect with people I thought were cool. \n\nLastly, if you don't want to listen to Beths warning, listen to mine. Be very careful with people who are much older that try to manipulate you. For whatever purpose. They will probably try to connect with you by saying \"you're so mature already\" and \"People shouldn't be treating you as a kid, you're nearly an adult\" and what not. So be mindful. Because it seems like they're merely validating your feelings but it usually isn't. Because they don't think that themselves.\n\nSo for getting Beth kicked out because she didn't want to be your friend, YTA. You can't force people to interact with yoy. But be careful.", "YTA. You just proved her right as well. You are to Young!", "YTA you acted immaturely. You\u2019re butthurt she didn\u2019t want to be your friend so you got her kicked off. Adults shouldn\u2019t be friends with teenagers, she was worried your being groomed and to be careful and you get her kicked off for warning you. You will understand when you are older. Your not mature for your age the men saying that are just creepy and trying to make you feel special.", "Yta. You asked her why she was distant and she answered and then you got mad because you didn't like her response. Then due to a situation you created by asking her she was kicked from a community she had been with for 5 years and had people harassing her because she answered your question honestly and with empathy. \n\nI really hope you are reading these comments and thinking about what is being said here. A lot of women gamers have responded. Personally I'm not a discord fan but used chat programs like vent and those conversations would get awful. I remember one time walking in on a chat, the guys in a guild I was in rating what female guild members they would have sex with willing or not. I was horrified and I was in my 40s at the time. I told the other women and left the guild. One left gaming and never came back, some left and one stayed. Not all guys are like that and I don't want that to be the take away but in this case? Why didn't they try to talk to her before kicking her and why are you ok with that?", "YTA.\n\nI'm a 40 year old female gamer and I'm also here to tell you that men who are in their 30s and 40s aren't your \"friends\". Beth was doing exactly what I would. I (and any other responsible adult) have no interest in befriending a teenager who has almost nothing in common as far as life experience goes. If she's telling you to watch who you talk to, she knows more about what's going on in the background than you do. Heed her warning\n\nYou're the only teen? Yeah. These grown men are not your friends. They don't see you they way you think they do, trust me.", "Girl, YTA. But I think your biggest issue here isn't your conflict with Beth.\n\nLook, I get it. I was a teenaged girl once, too, and a lot of adult men paid me a lot of attention. I can understand why, for you, that might be exciting and might make you think it's just because you are \"so mature\" or something extra special. But, honey, it's not. Any man in his mid-20s or older who is \"befriending\" you while you are 17 years old is crossing major lines. And while this word gets thrown around far too freely in today's world, it's likely that one or more of those men are grooming you.\n\nSure, you might have some interests in common with some of these 30 year old men, like gaming, tv shows, or whatever. But there is a massive power imbalance between a 30 year old man and a 17 year old girl. And **those men are well aware of that fact.** Beth clearly was, too, and was trying to tell you to be very careful. But you got pissy and became a tattletale just because **she didn't want to be friends with you.** That alone shows that you are not mature enough to read this situation clearly.\n\n**At 17, you don't know what you don't know yet. And what you don't know, especially as a 17 year old girl hanging out with a bunch of fully-adult men, can be extremely dangerous for you.**", "\"Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!\"\n\nHope you understand what i am trying to say\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nI had horrible experiences online when I told people my age. Most of the times the \u201cfriends\u201d of mine lied about their ages. Beth knows better and she is right when talking about the people that are in the server.", "'Oh my god someone won't be my friend because they said I'm too immature so I'm going to tattle on her for being mean and not being my friend'\n\nSomething a child would say. Oh that's you.", "I feel a little bad for Beth. Soft YTA", "YTA, and honestly worried about you. You're 17 - it's weird and worrying for men in their 30s and 40s to be wanting to hang out with you. It becomes especially worrying when those men remove an older woman who is trying to protect you. You will realise this when you get to that age, and I just hope that you don't realise it earlier because of predatory men. As you said, Beth was never cruel to you, she wasn't mean, she just tried to implement healthy boundaries with a child - because that's what you are. Maybe try and take a step back and realise what kind of people would kick a woman off a server for trying to set boundaries, and think about whether those are the kind of people you want to be friends with, no matter their age - people who exclude someone for setting boundaries.", "YTA\n\nBeth didn\u2019t want to be your friend and you went and tattled because of it. Not everyone is going to want to know you, kid, get used to it. \n\nAlso the fact that a discord of 30-40 year old men kicked out the 30 year old woman for being outspoken and not including the MINOR, but kept you? Yeah, not good", "Yta. You are too young to be around people that age and you snitching on her shows how unprepared you are to have older friends.", "The fact you immediately went to the owner says enough about your maturity and why you shouldn't be in that server, lol. YTA obviously", "Gonna be rude but Idc.\n\nYTA and dumb and naive girl. Idk why you at such young age stay in server with people who are double your age and could be your father. Is this a way to seek validation for older me. And you went and complained about someone looking out for you. Most servers I been in that has many members in their 30s tend to have 21+ as age rule and 18+ at best, so it\u2019s extremely weird bunch of 30s and 40s year old men kick out a friend of 5 years for a girl who just join and is 17. Feels like something is kinda missing to this story.", "Jesus christ not only are you TA, but you are entitled as hell. Nobody HAS to be your friend. She was polite to you and that's bare minimum.  She didn't even have to be that. She was 100% correct and a 17 year old should not be on a discord with adults. Especially 30-40 year old men. You have do much maturing and growing up to do", "Hey love. 29F here. I think a lot of these comments are being unnecessarily nasty towards you, but the essence of what they're saying is true. I actually don't think you're the only asshole, though. I think ESH - except Beth.\n\nAs many have alluded to, the real AHs here are the 30-something dudes. Teenagers make mistakes - that's kind of what they're supposed to do, you're meant to fuck up and learn from it - but the adults should know better. Booting Beth for answering your question honestly - and then following it up with outright bullying - is fucked up, and it sets off all sorts of alarm bells. Please be careful. I know it feels so fucking patronising, but I swear to any god that's listening that I *vividly* remember what it was like to be 17, and I'm not trying to talk down to you. \n\nAt the end of the day, losing access to a discord server probably isn't the end of the world for Beth (and if I was her, after this palaver I'd be happier gone), so it's not like you've massively fucked her over (although the harassment is another kettle of fish). You might have fucked yourself over much harder if you no longer have anyone in that space looking out for your wellbeing. Keep your eyes open.", "YTA regardless of the age gap issue\n\nSomeone didn't want to be your friend. You tried to force her to be your friend. That's an AH move", "YTA I\u2019m in my 30s and do not knowingly engage with minors because someone my age shouldn\u2019t and has no reason to. Beth was trying to protect both of your interests and you sabotaged that.", "\u201cPick me\u201d girl got picked. Hopefully you\u2019ll learn from this and grow into a person who really is mature.

Beth has been part of the community for a little over 5 years. When I joined, Beth has been very \"distant\" towards me ever since finding out about my age and just kept our communications to the bare minimum. Everyone else has been very open and welcoming towards me. \n\nBeth is super nice to everyone else and she is super funny and really good at playing games and I really want to be her friend. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw her in the discord call and I went in there and asked her why she has been so cold towards me. She told me \"You're 17 and in this discord is a bunch of people who are in their 30s and some close to their 40s. These aren't your \"friends\" and I don't find it right for you to be in here and that you should find friends that are more around your age\" She continued to tell me that she is just keeping my best interest at heart.  I guess during the heat of the moment I told her that she doesn't know shit about me and shouldn't be coming up with a decision based on my age. Beth didn't argue back and just told me that when I get older, I will understand.\n\nThis is where I think I might be TA. I went to the \"owner\" of the server and kinda told them what happened and they kicked Beth from the server because she wasn't \"welcoming enough\"\n\nBeth is getting a lot of backlash from some of the guys on the discord because of what happened. I dm'd her personally and asked if she was okay and she never responded to me. I still stand by what I said. I am old enough to make my own decisions and I really don't think I need someone to tell me what is good and what is bad. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "[removed]", "YTA", "As someone (25f) who has gamed since I was 13, she has a bit of a point and I can see where she\u2019s coming from. I kind of agree. \n\nYou are a minor, and you are female. In a gaming world dominated by men. And you are in a discord with a lot of older men. And you are a minor. (Depending on state but still) you could get taken advantage of by these older people that pretend to be your friend. It\u2019s happened to me before countless times on different servers and even in gaming communities. I think she\u2019s just trying to tell you that in your situation she sees someone who could get taken advantage of and someone who is possibly naive to the dangers of being surrounded by that environment, so she\u2019s either nervous to engage or she\u2019s taking the responsible road of not screwing around with minor players periodt. Either way I don\u2019t think she was being malicious. \n\n\nSidebar: of course the grown men are going to shit on her and push her out of the discord, she tried to teach the shiny new toy to be careful!", "YTA and ratting her out was a rotten thing to do. You\u2019re not mature, you\u2019re not experienced, and these men will take advantage of that. But yeah, you\u2019ll learn\u2014the hard way.", "YTA. She\u2019s right, you don\u2019t get it yet. I was groomed online for years when I was younger, but didn\u2019t understand how wrong it was until only fairly recently, and I\u2019m 19. That being said, maybe you aren\u2019t being groomed. Even still, it\u2019s inappropriate and dangerous for yourself to be in a space that is essentially for adults and catered to adults, who are much much older than you. The way you acted was immature, and seems like you just wanted to start drama. I understand how you feel, but it\u2019s important to hear this advice and outlook from other people.", "Of course they kicked her out, she was the only one in that group who actually cared to have an appropriate relationship with you! I\u2019ve had PLENTY of older guys reach out to me at that age, and they didn\u2019t just want to be \u201cfriends\u201d.  You should be weary of the guys in that group and you should consider leaving yourself. What do a bunch of 30 year old dudes have in common with a teenager????", "YTA", "YTA - 17 year olds are hunted by older people on the Internet, she was protecting you", "YTA, shes right. It might not seem that way to you, but you really will figure it out when youre older. At your age, brains arent fully developed and until maybe around 25 they won't be, due to this those in that age range tend to uh...I'm actually not sure how to put it without sounding like I'm throwing insults, I'm not, but you tend to be pretty dumb and do a LOT of dumb crap thatyou look back on and ask yourself \"how was i dumb enough to pull that stunt?\"", "YTA.\nYou are 17y old girl on a gaming discord full of men in their 30-40.

You acted like an immature brat, because you couldn\u2019t access the truth neither that she didn\u2019t want to be friends and you runned to the owner like a kids in kindergarten.", "Gentle YTA OP. I\u2019m a woman in my 30s who games and in several of my discord servers I refuse to interact with anyone under 18. Now I will be polite to them, but engaging constantly?  Nope. It\u2019s because legally, if something happens and authorities get involved, I will be found liable. Because I am the adult who was interacting with children. It\u2019s great that the rest of the server was welcoming, but Beth was trying to protect herself from any legal repercussions should anything happen. \n\nNow she will have to find a different community when she had been in one for 5 years. You\u2019re young, but take this as a warning. Not everyone is going to want to be your friend and interact with you on a deeply personal level. And running to the owner can have unintended consequences. The best thing you can do now is leave Beth alone.", "YTA - Beth is right and you may be too young to realize this but as someone in their 30\u2019s I can tell you that people who aren\u2019t even adults yet shouldn\u2019t be trying to pursue these kinds of overly familiar relationships with people in their late 20\u2019s to 40\u2019s.\n\nIt is inherently unbalanced when it comes to the power dynamic becuaee you are a child, whether you view yourself that way or not, and even a young adult in their early 20\u2019s would be disadvantaged in the social power dynamic with a much older person.\n\nBeth told you an uncomfortable truth, that you had no business hanging out with a bunch of much older men who were \u201cbeing friendly\u201d because it potentially creates a situation where you could be taken advantage of and hurt.\n\nYou did not like hearing that because if you recognized it as true then you would have to admit that you are putting yourself into unsafe situations, that the men you have been interacting with did not care enough to respond to you as a child properly, and that you were not adult enough to realize your own immaturity in this situation.\n\nAnd because of that you got a woman looking out for you banned.\n\nI will ask you to think about this aspect though, who benefits when a server full of older men who are treating a minor like they are already an adult ban the only person that is vocal about looking out for that minors safety?\n\nI would very much run from that situation if I were you because you just got the only person that cared about your safety kicked off and I would not be surprised if at least a few of those adults who are being friendly with you are very happy about that.", "Yta. You don\u2019t need to force your presence on someone who doesn\u2019t want your friendship. And then you had to tattle to someone like a child when you get told what you didn\u2019t want to hear. She\u2019s known those people on the server a lot longer than your so you should take her advice that they may not be good for you. And to be honest it\u2019s creepy you\u2019re so insistent to be their friend.", "YTA. And get out of the discord server. 17 year old\ngirls don\u2019t need to be impressing 30/40 year old men, ask me how I know. That\u2019s really creepy they responded like that.

And when a woman expresses concern for a young woman, especially in male dominated spaces, please listen.", "YTA.

All of us around this age have grew up watching the internet change and the most consistent thing is men talking to underage girls. So there will always be an older fem experience saying they don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. A very good chunk of us do.", "YTA and Beth was right. But what do I know, I\u2019m a 27 yo woman.", "YTA. First off, it does matter how old you are. Unless you moved out and emmancipated yourself from your parents, im sure they arent going to be happy about you interacting with people twice your age on the internet. Your not an adult yet. What makes you think your respomsible enough to be on an adult discord?\n\nSecond: this other girl is not required to be your friend. As long as she wasn't actively bullying you then you had no right to go after the way you did. From your own admission everyone else was warm and welcoming. It was just this one person.\n\nThere is just no way you come out of this NTA", "YTA you got her kicked out because she didn't want to risk being associated with a minor that could possibly be miss conceived. You know how many adults on the internet get in trouble for some innocent conversations and how many adults don't for the disgusting ones?", "I am on a discord forum, and we had a few minors on. I kept my distance as I was in my late 30\u2019s - I was cordial and always answered their questions and was never dismissive, but I also kept the conversation very light. I too was once a minor on the internet, back in the beginning of chat rooms, and it is so so easy to be groomed by people who will try and make you trust them because they are older.\n\nAs a minor, some spaces are not meant for you. Period. \n\nThe fact that you ran to the owners to tattle on a member who was just trying to protect you and got them booted is pretty gross, but also typical teenage minor behaviour. So yeah, YTA.\n\nEdit to say: this is also a lesson in boundaries. In the real world, not everyone wants to be your friend or be around you. People are allowed their space and shouldn\u2019t be forced to interact with you. Beth was trying to maintain a boundary, and you, a literal child, did not understand that. Because you are a literal child. Please seek out people your own age.", "YTA\u2026 as an older woman who also spent some time in discord\u2026 you seriously have no idea.

I\u2019m 28f and I\u2019m telling you she may have been a bit blunt.  But being in  chats with people OVER double your age is dangerous In ways teenagers are literally not ready for.

There\u2019s a reason why people have an age limit when it comes to their discord or their chats and you really proved why the age limit is needed in my eyes.

She\u2019s an adult and you\u2019re a minor. What could y\u2019all possibly talk about, which I\u2019m sure the discord isn\u2019t used for just the game, one on one?

I can't wait until you turn 25 and your entire brain chemistry changes (cause that does happen) and you realize how differently you perceived things and thought as a teenager because YOUR BRAIN CHANGES, it's not about your maturity. You brain literally will not function the same way when you're older as it did when you were a teen. \n\nWhich is why Beth was trying to protect you from potentially predatory guys that can easily manipulate and gaslight someone that is 17. In fact a lot of older guys that are rejected by adult women (because adult women recognize the red flag behavior) pray on young girls that are barely legal because they can manipulate them with their behavior into trusting and caring for them and believing they 'know them' and then they turn around and gaslight/manipulate you into becoming who they want you to be.\n\nBeth was right. You definitely shouldn't be in a server with 30 and 40 year olds and the fact that they were so desperate to keep you there to kick out a member of 5 years and seemingly one of the rare women in the server is really freaking concerning.", "YTA\n\nYou're going to feel like a completely different person at 27.  Whether you think you're mature or not, you'll have a completely different perspective.  Do you still think the same way you did at 13?   Most likely not.  The more years you have the bigger the gap feels.  Beth is looking out for something that you don't have the life experience to be wary of.

She understands that a \"friendship\" of any kind with a MINOR Child, because that is what you are whether you accept that or not, is *not* appropriate. You literally are not old enough to Vote yet in the US fam.\n\nShe wasn't trying to bully you. She wasn't trying to scare you. She was big time looking out for you. I get that the participants in Discord servers are well and truly varied, but there is no real reason a 17 year old girl and and 40 year old man should be chatting it up unless that man is your father, uncle, cousin, or brother. And they prob not even that close of a bro or cousin since they were 23 and most likely done with *college* before your parents even considered making you exist. \n\nAnd to note, you stated \"I'm old enough to make my own decisions\" -- and then turned right around and played tattle-tale to the DM. \ud83d\ude10", "YTA.

Maybe none of them are, however it is strange that 30-40 year old men are comfortable having a 17 year old (I don\u2019t care how \u201cmature\u201d you are.

Even in the \"olden days\" before webcams this was a thing. Old chat rooms and forums could get really nasty sometimes.\n\nBut building on this, OP as you continue to mature keep this in mind. In the professional world women tend to have a stereotype of being catty. Hell it's an unconscious bias. It's even worse if you're a woman of color (angry black woman anyone?). Do you want to fulfill that stereotype of being the catty office mate who doesn't get her way and throws others under the bus? Or do you want to help others?\n\nAs women we have the deck stacked against us in a lot of ways compared to our male counterparts. We should be building each other up. Not tearing each other down. \n\nEspecially when some random person on the internet, who is 10 years older than you, doesn't want to be your friend. Not everyone in life will be. And you won't want to be friends with everyone else either. \n\nRight now, and I speak from experience with colleagues, you're on track to be another future poster on this forum with similar work and life issues.\n\nRight now it's a gal on a discord server. But in 5-10 years it might be that gal at work you want to mentor you. Or someone in the office doesn't want to eat the cookies you baked. Or some other asinine reason. Look through this sub, there's a ton of stories. \n\nAs others have said, being \"mature for your age\", is not the compliment you think it is. You have a lot of growing up to do. And that's OK. Take this as an early lesson in life and move forward.", "Beth tried the approach of being subtle and it didn\u2019t work, since OP mentions her being \u201cdistant\u201d.\n\nI think her being blunt is appropriate at that point, especially with how OP handled the situation.", "RIP beth you was a OG for real"]}
