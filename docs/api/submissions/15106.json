It's your birth and you have the absolute right to take whatever time you need to recover/enjoy your new baby. Her behavior is abhorrent. You just do you and they'll either get over it or they won't.

Your MIL is being such a selfish and entitled AH, I wouldn't blame you for telling her that she can't see the baby until she completes a few months of therapy. She's unhinged. \n\nBTW, two weeks is nothing. A lot of mothers don't let ANY visitors to see the baby for a month or more. You never know what complications will come up and there's always the threat of PPD. \n\nFear not, you and your husband are completely in the right. You're basically just going to have to tell you MIL that you don't want to hear any more complaints and she's just going to have to learn to live with you handle YOUR newborn.", "NTA.

Everyone else can wait their turn while you bond with your child as a family.\n\nWhile I think what grandma asked is reasonable... she didn't really ask. Just got mad it wasn't an option.

I would seriously consider not letting her around your child at all.", "NTA.

Don't let the door hit you on your way out, Nasty ILs!", "NTA.\n\nFor our first kid I had to do the same - my in-law family was in town and planned to stay for two weeks or more. I only had two weeks off from work and wanted to spend every minute with my wife and our new son and not leave the house. Had to have a frank conversation about that. You only have your first kid and those special weeks once", "Oh absolutely NTA. A piece of advice I once got from a therapist, with people like this you have to be like a broken record player and keep repeating the same message. If you keep explaining yourself they continue to find things to argue about, but when you keep telling them \u2018no, we do not want people coming by the first 2 weeks\u2019 you won\u2019t give them anything to argue. Believe me, no one finds things to argue about when you\u2019ve told them the same thing 4 times. It can be difficult though, when they demand an explanation but you don\u2019t owe them one, just repeat the message \u2018because we have decided to not have any visitors for 2 weeks.\u2019 \nYou have to give up trying to explain to them why this is important to you because they never will and they don\u2019t even want to understand it. All it does is adding fuel to their arguing. I am sorry you are going through this. \n\nPlus making the birth about you is actually kind of the point of the whole birth.", "Absolutely NTA what a fucking lunatic. Of course this birth is about you and what you\u2019re families needs are. Start grey rocking now, don\u2019t tell them your due date, don\u2019t tell them when you\u2019re in labor and if they do show up.

That\u2019s not unfair, that\u2019s reality.\n\nYou are ruining their fantasy - but that\u2019s the problem with fantasies, indulging in them can often mean forgetting that the other people involved are people, not props.\n\nThere COULD have been a middle ground here - your husband takes the baby out to meet them for a brief intro while you rest, or even get the keys to your home to clean/prep for your coming home and a brief meet and greet. But that they immediately went to \u201cyou\u2019re ruining this for US\u201d is appalling.\n\n(If my cousin has kids I\u2019m totally going to offer to clean their place while they are at the hospital, and get info on birth weight to stock up on correctly sized diapers. Would I like to see the bb then run? Yes. But if they were like, no see bb until 2 weeks, I\u2019d say, yes ma\u2019am.

You do what is best for your family. You might want to look at r/JUSTNOMIL for pointers. As for your partner, direct him over to r/raisedbynarcissists. He needs to have the backbone to hang up on his sister, mother, or any other family member berating him. He should NOT put up with being abused for an hour. A simple \"This is the way it is going to be. Case closed. Goodbye,\" then hanging up is fine. Leave any nasty messages on read.\n\nAlso, don't tell them when the baby is born, and make sure everyone you do want to know doesn't put it on any social media so they can't find out. That way you will get your two weeks without worrying about them just showing up. If, for some reason, they do, call the cops and have them removed. \n\nSet your boundaries in steel or they will stomp all over you.", "NTA at all, and at this point you both need to stop engaging.

The next time my sister had a baby? My mom was really sick and couldn't be involved that time around. \n\nOther people are excited about this baby. Let them have that. Let them be excited for you and with you. Consider reframing it with gratitude that people are supportive and excited about this baby. Consider a compromise of letting them celebrate and see the baby when it's born and come back in 2 weeks.

Two weeks becomes three, three becomes four, until they get the message.\n\n\nHowever, I'm not you and you might not be comfortable doing that. So what you definitely need to do is start mentally preparing for your two weeks of peace. Announce to family that your due date was misjudged earlier and it's actually a month later in the year (the baby just grew really fast in the beginning whoops!) Explain to your son that he cannot share any information about your pregnancy with family - he should just say \"I don't know, you'd have to ask OP.\" Same to any close friends or family members that you want in the loop.

They have respected my boundaries ever since.", "NTA you sound perfectly reasonable.", "NTA - You and your partner need to stop the info train.

It sucks.", "NTA.. her saying you\u2019re making the birth about you as if it\u2019s a bad thing. She\u2019s not the one passing a watermelon through her nostril she has no say.

Best to set the ground rules now as your in laws could be nightmare grandparents.", "NTA - your baby, your rules; unless a doctor says otherwise.", "NTA, and remember that in addition to impacting your very important post-partum weeks, how formally you hold this boundary is setting the first precedent for how your in-laws are going to be able to treat you as a parent to their grandchild.

A photo or video should be sufficient.", "NTA. Only one person is giving birth - you, and you get to call the shots. Bonus points for having the restraint to not tell the MIL to F off after she basically told you she doesn't give a shit about your boundaries.", "NTA, but just add 2 more weeks every time they complain.\n\nYou've been cordial, its not working, and I'm guessing your partner doesn't want to flat out refuse they ever meet the baby, so this should suffice.

Respect the parents of their grandchild or leave.", "NTA If they want an experience that's all about them, they can pop a baby. Take care of your small family and congratulations on the new one!", "NTA, I even encurage you to do it.

No single soul in this world is entitled to your brand new baby except for you. Your MIL needs to be shut down now, and your partner needs to be the one to do it. You have to be firm and not accept any compromise. This is your (you and your partner\u2019s) time to bond with your baby and for your son to bond with his sibling. No one else is entitled to that special time. From personal experience, I absolutely regret not forcing in-law grandparents to leave when they showed up uninvited to \u201csee their baby\u201d - after I had clearly told them we weren\u2019t having visitors. I felt that my time with my baby early on in his life was stolen from me, my chance to get him and I into a comfortable routine early on was compromised, and I absolutely regret letting anyone else into the house during those first couple of weeks. He was so sleep deprived from being passed around like a football, and I couldn\u2019t enforce my boundaries with my noodle of a husband undermining me.

It'd be much worse if they weren't interested in your children. \nNAH.", "Also don\u2019t tell her when you go into labour. Like at all. Make sure no one else tells her or your partners family either. Or she WILL turn up at the hospital.", "Honestly, I\u2019d just not announce the birth until 2 weeks after the kid is born at this point! \n\nIf anyone asks OP/Partner can say \u201cI guess baby\u2019s not ready to meet everyone yet!\u201d", "Grandparents play a supporting role and in their case it sounds like barely that bc they live in a different country. But the key word is support as in from them to the parents.\n\nThe way they reacted shows they will expect to be the center of attention of any visit they make. That's obviously an unreasonable expectation but an indication that the visit is likely to be difficult. OP and partner will need to brace for impact.\n\nIn retrospect, two weeks might not be enough.", "I second this. Add more time the more she and the family push.\nWtf is with people thinking a birth is a party and spectical for people to see. You also introducing a baby to a child who is anxious about the baby. More people is more stress on him as well.\n\nMake a united front and tell them to back off. Enjoy the birth and time after as long as you need.", "Well if the birth isn't about OP the birth definitely isn't about MIL!!", "You mean her partner will relay this info", "Totally NTA. MIL doesn't respect boundaries boundaries is ironically making this all about her. Stand your ground. You're the one doing the hard work of bringing a baby into the world so you get to set the Ts&Cs about how that's gonna happen, so MIL and SIL will just have to deal.", "This ^ . OP needs to tell the nurses that absolutely NO ONE is allowed into the room even after the baby is born (with the exception of partner) and no information is to be given to ANYONE. OP is NTA", "\"Every time we're upset by what you say, that's an extra day.\" Worded like that, so even fey lawyers can't get round it. Keep a running tally. You've been and are being reasonable, now you need to train them like the unhinged ferrets they're being.", "Lol. Just keeping adding two more weeks every time she complains. Might get up to no visits until the baby\u2019s first birthday.", "People really show you who they are when you have a kid. Once loving mothers will turn into monster boundary stomping grandmothers. It gives you quite the whiplash", "I know, it's really so wild. In the military it's EXPECTED of you if you're a commander/platoon leader, to visit your Soldier in the hospital after a birth and even for other medical situations you go to \"check on them\" and show support, bring a gift basket, etc.  \n  \nIt sounds sweet but to me as a female, I had the sense to ask when my Soldier gave birth to her 3rd child I straight up asked her, do you want me to come? Because honestly it seems pretty invasive to just show up during such a time. And she said, please, no. Lol. And it's not like we weren't friendly we had known each other for years and were very friendly and she had actually been looping me in to other personal medical issues when she didn't need to. \n  \nAs I thought. You can really tell some of these military etiquette traditions were started by men with no thought for women's feelings.", ">No way are they just \u2018popping in for a second\u2019, they will stay there for the entire first 2 weeks\n\nThis was a major red flag for me, too. They say they will only pop in and then come back in two weeks, but when you think about the logistics, it's not believable. More likely than not they'd show up and then twist the screws to not leave.", "Taking the baby away from it\u2019s mom to meet them is even worse. Seriously, how has Western culture gotten so completely f\u2019d up about the needs of babies? A baby and it\u2019s mother are a dyad. They are meant to be together. A baby considers itself to be still part of its mother for months after the birth. Separating mother and child, oassing babies around, etc., are all things that are harmful to babies. The only arms a newborn should be in, are it\u2019s mother\u2019s or father\u2019s.", "OP doesn\u2019t need to compromise. It\u2019s 100% about her and the baby, no one else. If they want to throw a fit and distance themselves from her as a result, that\u2019s their choice.", "You are so wrong. I don't know where to begin", "Given their reaction to this, I would also make absolutely sure they're all vaccinated to be safe around the baby. (I did not, for instance, know until I was pregnant the first time that whooping cough was a concern!) They don't really seem the type to care about the baby's health either.", "Agreed! Also make sure the hospital staff knows that no else is allowed in the delivery room aside from your partner (assuming this is a thing in your country). \n\nAnd honestly, Op, Stop explaining yourselves. You do *not* have to justify to others why you want time alone with your newborn. Contrary to what your ILs are saying, this is absolutely about you, the mother giving birth. It\u2019s absolutely also about your partner becoming a new dad. It\u2019s absolutely about your son becoming a big brother. It\u2019s about you having time to heal, rest, bond, love. Anyone who doesn\u2019t get that is not worth your breath. Either they get on board and understand they are in a *supporting* role, or they don\u2019t get a heads up that baby is here until much much later, when you have all rested enough to invite in their nonsense. Stop responding to their nonsense. Stop explaining. Just flat out tell them, \u201cNO! This is not about *you*. We are *done* talking about this. If you bring up your demands or guilt tripping again then we will be forced to end this call\u201d. And then hang up **every** time they don\u2019t listen.", "With all this complaining, it'll be a lot easier for OP to track if she just adds a month each time they complain.\n\nAnd now your first opportunity will be August. Now September.  Are you shooting for September, 2030?\n\nEntitled people need to learn their places.", "The best thing Covid did for me was make my pediatrician extra cautious. Since our baby was born in the winter (flu season) he said NOPE no visitors until the kid is 1 months. Both sets of grandparents were PISSED but it really set the boundaries straight away", "Well of course it didn't, because it was a flat out lie to try to weasel past your boundaries. It was only after you refused to budge that they escalated to this kind of tantrum. I guarantee you they would've stayed \"just a little longer\" and then \"oh we can't get a flight out until next week\" etc. If you'd given them that inch, they'd have turned it into several miles.", "Obviously not, they\u2019d want to stay overnight at the minimum because \u201cwe\u2019ve come so far, the least you can do is let us stay the night!\u201d And then you\u2019ll be lectured about how you clearly need the help and they\u2019re staying", "You and your partner need to stand your ground, united, and if they still don't stop with the pestering tell them you are going to temporary cut contact and any info about the baby. They saw you one time and now expect they just get all hands on deck. Maybe they could have come sooner for a visit to help a pregnant lady. They can't just expect to get privileges  wit no work. Talk to your partner and decide the course you want to take. But if you do decide to cut contact make sure to hide any info about when and where the birth is to take place. They may show up unexpectedly and try to force you into their solution.", "I think that\u2019s true of the MIL, but is there no one else? Having a blanket rule is hard. That first week was the most challenging of my life to date. It sounds like she might have had more help with the first baby", "Great answer! Everyone should be vaccinated with Tdap before touching a baby.", "This is unrelated to the main post but they should absolutely require that everybody meeting a newborn is up to date with their vaccines (at least TDAP, probably flu and COVID as well).", "Either way though that's her choice completely!!! The baby's father will be there as well.  Many people do it solo and are ok.", "Yep. I required this when visiting the baby"]}
