Your MIL is being such a selfish and entitled AH, I wouldn't blame you for telling her that she can't see the baby until she completes a few months of therapy. She's unhinged. \n\nBTW, two weeks is nothing. A lot of mothers don't let ANY visitors to see the baby for a month or more. You never know what complications will come up and there's always the threat of PPD. \n\nFear not, you and your husband are completely in the right. You're basically just going to have to tell you MIL that you don't want to hear any more complaints and she's just going to have to learn to live with you handle YOUR newborn.", "NTA.

Everyone else can wait their turn while you bond with your child as a family.\n\nWhile I think what grandma asked is reasonable... she didn't really ask. Just got mad it wasn't an option.

Don't let the door hit you on your way out, Nasty ILs!", "NTA.\n\nFor our first kid I had to do the same - my in-law family was in town and planned to stay for two weeks or more. I only had two weeks off from work and wanted to spend every minute with my wife and our new son and not leave the house. Had to have a frank conversation about that. You only have your first kid and those special weeks once", "Oh absolutely NTA. A piece of advice I once got from a therapist, with people like this you have to be like a broken record player and keep repeating the same message. If you keep explaining yourself they continue to find things to argue about, but when you keep telling them \u2018no, we do not want people coming by the first 2 weeks\u2019 you won\u2019t give them anything to argue. Believe me, no one finds things to argue about when you\u2019ve told them the same thing 4 times. It can be difficult though, when they demand an explanation but you don\u2019t owe them one, just repeat the message \u2018because we have decided to not have any visitors for 2 weeks.\u2019 \nYou have to give up trying to explain to them why this is important to you because they never will and they don\u2019t even want to understand it. All it does is adding fuel to their arguing. I am sorry you are going through this. \n\nPlus making the birth about you is actually kind of the point of the whole birth.", "Absolutely NTA what a fucking lunatic. Of course this birth is about you and what you\u2019re families needs are.

That\u2019s not unfair, that\u2019s reality.\n\nYou are ruining their fantasy - but that\u2019s the problem with fantasies, indulging in them can often mean forgetting that the other people involved are people, not props.\n\nThere COULD have been a middle ground here - your husband takes the baby out to meet them for a brief intro while you rest, or even get the keys to your home to clean/prep for your coming home and a brief meet and greet. But that they immediately went to \u201cyou\u2019re ruining this for US\u201d is appalling.\n\n(If my cousin has kids I\u2019m totally going to offer to clean their place while they are at the hospital, and get info on birth weight to stock up on correctly sized diapers. Would I like to see the bb then run? Yes. But if they were like, no see bb until 2 weeks, I\u2019d say, yes ma\u2019am.

You do what is best for your family. You might want to look at r/JUSTNOMIL for pointers. As for your partner, direct him over to r/raisedbynarcissists. He needs to have the backbone to hang up on his sister, mother, or any other family member berating him. He should NOT put up with being abused for an hour. A simple \"This is the way it is going to be. Case closed. Goodbye,\" then hanging up is fine. Leave any nasty messages on read.\n\nAlso, don't tell them when the baby is born, and make sure everyone you do want to know doesn't put it on any social media so they can't find out. That way you will get your two weeks without worrying about them just showing up. If, for some reason, they do, call the cops and have them removed. \n\nSet your boundaries in steel or they will stomp all over you.", "NTA at all, and at this point you both need to stop engaging.

The next time my sister had a baby? My mom was really sick and couldn't be involved that time around. \n\nOther people are excited about this baby. Let them have that. Let them be excited for you and with you. Consider reframing it with gratitude that people are supportive and excited about this baby. Consider a compromise of letting them celebrate and see the baby when it's born and come back in 2 weeks.

Two weeks becomes three, three becomes four, until they get the message.\n\n\nHowever, I'm not you and you might not be comfortable doing that. So what you definitely need to do is start mentally preparing for your two weeks of peace. Announce to family that your due date was misjudged earlier and it's actually a month later in the year (the baby just grew really fast in the beginning whoops!) Explain to your son that he cannot share any information about your pregnancy with family - he should just say \"I don't know, you'd have to ask OP.\" Same to any close friends or family members that you want in the loop.

There is no actual reason you have to post on Facebook the same day as the birth. A simple \"Two weeks ago we welcomed a new member of the family. Everyone say hello to XX!\" and add your cute pictures with a clear head.", "NTA. I made the same rule when my second was born, and I had similar backlash....so when my third was born, I told everyone who complained about my two week rule, that it was 12 weeks now. They have respected my boundaries ever since.", "NTA you sound perfectly reasonable.", "NTA - You and your partner need to stop the info train. You don't have to justify your decision, and repeating yourself and continuing to entertain the topic makes them feel they have input. They don't get to determine your birth, and if they keep it up it can be three months before they meet your little one.\n\nShut this down and don't give them more head space. They WILL ruin this birth if you let them.", "NTA. And be careful about what details you give. I tried to do this, too. Perfectly reasonable and very common these days.\n\nMy family flew in anyway and just showed up at my house. They still won\u2019t apologize, and think I am the bad guy. It sucks.", "NTA.. her saying you\u2019re making the birth about you as if it\u2019s a bad thing. She\u2019s not the one passing a watermelon through her nostril she has no say. Your body, your baby, your rules. Best to set the ground rules now as your in laws could be nightmare grandparents.", "NTA - your baby, your rules; unless a doctor says otherwise.", "NTA, and remember that in addition to impacting your very important post-partum weeks, how formally you hold this boundary is setting the first precedent for how your in-laws are going to be able to treat you as a parent to their grandchild. Do they get to throw a fit and then do whatever they want? Or do you have authority over your own family?", "NTA. Of course it\u2019s all about you and your husband and baby. Stop arguing with those block heads. Change the subject or end the call. They have the rest of the baby\u2019s life to see him. Newborns aren\u2019t that interesting. A photo or video should be sufficient.", "NTA. Only one person is giving birth - you, and you get to call the shots. Bonus points for having the restraint to not tell the MIL to F off after she basically told you she doesn't give a shit about your boundaries.", "NTA, but just add 2 more weeks every time they complain.\n\nYou've been cordial, its not working, and I'm guessing your partner doesn't want to flat out refuse they ever meet the baby, so this should suffice. They're selfishly making this a more stressful situation over nothing, and have shown nothing but disrespect and contempt for you. If they come and act out, they will be forced to leave. Respect the parents of their grandchild or leave.", "NTA If they want an experience that's all about them, they can pop a baby. Take care of your small family and congratulations on the new one!", "NTA, I even encurage you to do it. A study from our (Danish) hospitals showed that the use of milk replament went down during the hard Covid Lockdowns. It turns out that it is easier to breast feed if you are not stressed by visitors. You have science on your side :)", "OP, Your body your choice. As long as you and your partner are on the same page and agree that's what you want, it doesn't matter in any way, shape, or form what your family and friends want. Both of you need to \"stick to your guns\" so to speak.", "NTA\n\nThis is the time for your family to bond, for you to recover, your son to meet his sibling, and everything else. This is not the time for everyone to bombard you. Stand your ground and if I was your partner, I would send a message to all those that are harassing him that the first two weeks will be private and no more discussion would be involved. If they do, the conversation would end. \n\nI would highly suggest that you do not let them know when you are having the baby. I could see them coming anyway.", "NTA, and be strong with your boundaries because it sounds like MIL will keep trying to push them. You don\u2019t have to apologize for your decision, and in my opinion i would give MIL consequences for the disrespect. The longer she shits and nags, the longer it\u2019ll be until she can meet her grandchild. It\u2019s that simple to me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I didn\u2019t even have to read past the title, ABSOLUTELY NTA. No single soul in this world is entitled to your brand new baby except for you. Your MIL needs to be shut down now, and your partner needs to be the one to do it. You have to be firm and not accept any compromise. This is your (you and your partner\u2019s) time to bond with your baby and for your son to bond with his sibling. No one else is entitled to that special time. From personal experience, I absolutely regret not forcing in-law grandparents to leave when they showed up uninvited to \u201csee their baby\u201d - after I had clearly told them we weren\u2019t having visitors. I felt that my time with my baby early on in his life was stolen from me, my chance to get him and I into a comfortable routine early on was compromised, and I absolutely regret letting anyone else into the house during those first couple of weeks. He was so sleep deprived from being passed around like a football, and I couldn\u2019t enforce my boundaries with my noodle of a husband undermining me. So stick to your guns and do not let anyone walk all over you. You will be angry at yourself if you don\u2019t, but much more relaxed and happy if you do. Good luck!", "Definitely NTA. If I'd had vaginal births with any of mine, I would've wanted that special bonding time with my baby. But as it was, I had c-sections and took all the help I could get.", "Make it 4 weeks.  That enough time for you and papa and baby to find some kind of equilibrium and routine. If in-laws get fussy, push it back until baby starts their vaccination schedule at 8 weeks.", "NTA. I didn't want out of town visitors 4 days after I gave birth to twins. One the normal way with an episiotomy and one emergency c-section.   Family had a fit.  Oh well.", "NTA. My massage therapist insisted on three months of zero visits unless it was to help out by bringing food (and leaving without setting foot inside), or taking their dog for a walk (these were the gifts they asked for at the shower\u2026great idea!).\n\nThis birth is about YOU, YOUR PARTNER, and your BABY. Everyone else, including the in-laws, can go suck an egg!", "If there is anyone that this birth is about it is you and the baby. (Your husband is a distant third) You need time to heal and the baby needs time to get adjusted to their new norm. \n\nThis birth is NOT about your extended family. It may be the first grandchild, BUT the birth is still not about them. If they were on the other side of the world, this birth would happen without them. If they were no longer living, this birth would happen without them. They have nothing to do with this birth.\n\nYou (and your husband), along with the baby are the ONLY ones that this birth is about. \n\nNTA and I second the poster that recommended the JustNo subreddit. They will be able to help with advice and references and recommendations.", "No lol I took 4 months after the fiasco that was my first birth. And family accepted this and happily accommodated. \n\nIf they wanted to they would \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nta, my in laws (my family lives very far) never pushed seeing our son after he was discharged from the NICU, obviously in laws and my parents flew to see him during the stay in the NICU but this was all in a safe controlled environment and we were OK with it he was a very surprise baby after all.\n\nAfter discharge, it was just me and dad taking care of him ourselves, my mil and FIL didn't see him after discharge for weeks.", "NTA\n\nGo over tin r/JustNoMil for support and venting.\n\n\n\nLet everyone know due to emotional, physical, and medical needs ...no visitors the first two weeks. Anyone who berates and tries to argue from this point on will be blocked and not allowed to visit for 2 months instead. Enforce the blocking. Your life will be easier.\n\nPut a ring or doorbell camera of some sort at your home. Do not allow them in if they show up. Call the police and have them escorted off your property if they do.\n\n\nDon't tell anyone when you're in labor. If someone knows make sure they know not to post or say anything.\n\nMake sure the hospital, labor and delivery staff, and doctors know you have a BAN in place for all visitors...except your husband. Make clear that you're specifically banning your inlaws. If they need a picture or their info..give it to them.", "NTA. And in a post pandemic world where RSV is running hard on babies. Even if you said no visits for 3 mos to give u time to heal and bond with baby and give the baby some chance to create an immune system i would still say NTA.", "Big giant NTA", "NTA but you might be really tired and it might be helpful to have a family member around.", "NTA. MILs actions are a good way to ensure she doesn't get told about the birth until 2 weeks after it happens. \n\nYours sincerely, woman at her due date.", "NTA. Stop apologizing for your boundary. Just state it as your family boundary and do not entertain discussion on it. I know it\u2019s hard, but you are allowed to have family time/boundaries. Congratulations to your little family !", "NTA. I'm due to have my baby in 1 month, it's the first grandchild on  oth sides. We have also asked for the family to stay away for 2 weeks while I heal and we get settled. My family and my in-laws, they said yep no problem. That's the reaction your families should have had. I mean it's a major medical procedure for one and two you're being a great mum to your other child at the same time.", "NTA. I\u2019d literally start telling them to F off since they think you are anyway \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they don\u2019t even care about you and their behavior is atrocious.", "Such pathetic logic on their part too- so what, is birth about *them* then and not the mother and baby?\n\nThis would be enough for me to say fuck it, you\u2019re out for a whole lot longer than 2 weeks and be done with them unless they come around and genuinely apologize for being out of line. Is your partner always on the receiving end of their bs? Nip this now because you guys are going to need each other more than anyone else", "Every time they complain,  add another two weeks.  Either they'll accept your rule, or maybe not even see the baby for a year!  Win win", "So abhorrent. MIL doesn\u2019t realize it, but she is just repeatedly demonstrating exactly why she shouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near OP until OP is good and ready to deal with her ridiculous behavior. If she\u2019s not careful \u201cnever\u201d is going to seem like the appropriate time.", "And the stress they are causing with this outrageous behaviour is also very bad for both you and the baby they are claiming to care so much about.", "Yeah, I\u2019m also doubtful of this family\u2019s ability to respect that boundary when they\u2019ve demonstrated a real failure to respect this one. They\u2019re just trying to get a foot in the door when you\u2019re weak and will have a harder time kicking them out.", "Apparently yes? It honestly made no sense to me", "All that can be done via video call (if OP is so inclined) and save them time and money. It\u2019s so clear that they just want to talk their way in and then will expect far more than popping in to say hi.", "No it didn\u2019t. You were excited. Excitement is not a life threatening condition.", "This MIL sounds like she would be way more work than help!!! NTA", "They can be excited. That doesn\u2019t mean they need to be present right away. And these people are not supportive, they are selfish.", "I'm petty and absolutely would be saying ok you can't come till after kiddos 2 month vaccines. We want to make sure he has a bit better immunity before seeing people \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Agreed. This is not the kind of BS new parents should be dealing with. As if they don't have enough going on with a newborn.", "Absolutely right. I wouldn't blame OP for cutting ties at all. I mean... wow."]}
