I give away a lot of free stuff for promotion, like I\u2019ve brought cupcakes to the fire station as a thanks, that sort of thing. My bakery box has my info if anyone\u2019s interested. \n\nI\u2019m part of a my neighborhoods buy nothingFB group, (post a pic of stuff you\u2019re getting rid of instead of just throwing it out, whoever wants it comments they\u2019re interested and pics it up from your doorstep, usually if multiple people are interested in one thing you just draw name to be fair) one day I tried a new recipe and since I\u2019m not going to eat a whole cake myself and at this point I don\u2019t even like it anymore, I needed someone to try it, so I decorated it like a generic birthday cake, posted it in the group & said \u201chey I have a home cake business and wanted to try out a new recipe, does anybody want this cake and would be willing to give me their feedback on it?\u201d There was a lot of interest! Someone asked for my business info so I commented back with the FB page. The page got a few new likes and I thought damn this is a really good way to get a free promotion. \n\nI\u2019ve done this a few times now, I do fib and say it was an order that didn\u2019t get picked up or something, maybe this makes me an asshole but people are getting free cake out of it so what\u2019s the harm? Luckily someone always asks for my info since I can\u2019t *technically* promote it, and it\u2019s definitely increased my sales! \n\nHERES the issue: I got a message from a lady who had gotten one of them. In the message she thanked me for the cake, said her family thought it was delicious and her daughters birthday was coming up so she was wondering if she could have my recipe. \n\nNow when I post to the group, it\u2019s from my personal account and I say I have a cake business, so if she messaged me through my personal account I could\u2019ve seen how she had gotten confused and would\u2019ve considered giving her the recipe. But this woman messaged me through my business FB account, she knows I sell them. So I replied that I was glad that she liked it and and while I had offered these cakes to the group to avoid throwing out perfectly good ones and a way to get unbiased feedback on recipes, I had hoped that whoever tried it would love it and come back for any future orders since my info is on the box. Unfortunately my recipes are my way of making money and I can\u2019t give it away. She said that she couldn\u2019t afford to order one, and what was the point in not giving it to her since I wasn\u2019t going to make a sale from her anyway. I again declined. She flipped out, then went to my page and left me a really terrible review that wasn\u2019t even truthful. \n\nI told a few coworkers at my real job \nabout it and some thought it was rude of me because she\u2019s right I wouldn\u2019t have made a sale from her anyway but others said that it was weird and super rude of her which was my thought as well so am I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1670989077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlgdbu/aita_for_not_giving_a_stranger_my_cake_recipe/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wow so because she can't afford the cake she feels like she entitled to your recipe?! The hell? I would blast her all over social media. That's so messed up. Especially because you're a small business and already have a ton to prove. Ugh! I'm so mad for you!", "What\u2019s stopping her from starting a small business with it? Selling it?

In business you\u2019ll probably come across multiple people like her but hopefully you can focus on the customers who do support your work and shrug off the demanding ones.", "NTA. 1) you have no control of who she'll give it to, maybe one of them would've bought it from you but now wouldn't have and 2) maybe she can't afford it *now* but that says nothing about the future (although she seems vindictive enough that your prudent business decision probably made that unlikely)", "The auDAcity of her!!!!!!!\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA, but I know someone who is! Her logic is flawed but the entitlement and utter disregard and disrespect for you as a business owner is shocking, frankly.\n\nIf you\u2019re a business giving something away for free, fine. ASKING a business to hand you something for free, however, and yes, your recipe has intrinsic value, \u201cbecause you wouldn\u2019t buy the finished product anyway, is so offensive. Would she go into a physical bakery and ask - and expect a yes! - for the same thing? Never.\n\nI think it\u2019s a great word-of-mouth idea and as long as you\u2019re genuinely giving stuff away for free, no harm no foul.

It would be insane to share a recipe.", "NTA. In general, I don't get hoarding recipes. However, this is your business. It would be like going to a bakery or restaurant and asking them for their recipes. They don't share them because that is something that makes their business special and unique.", "NTA \nSure she might never have purchased but if she has your secret she can open shop or just publish the recipe and ruin your biz.\n\nBtw if you send me the recipe I will only bake for myself and maybe share a piece with my gf...", "I make cakes too! The recipes I use are nothing special, my selling point is how well I can decorate them since I\u2019ve  had years of practice, so someone baking a cake in their home wouldn\u2019t be much competition to my sales and I still wouldn\u2019t give away any recipe. NTA\n\nI want to give you some advice that I learned the hard way and save you from it! 1-During an order consult ask as many questions as you can and don\u2019t hesitate to contact them if one arises in the process so when they come pick order they can\u2019t say this isn\u2019t what they wanted and try to get some money back. It just ensures that they\u2019re really gonna love their cake and return for more. \n2- Cake care cards- like tips on how to transport, keep it in the fridge, how many days it\u2019s good for, there\u2019s a whole bunch on Etsy if you\u2019re interested. I started doing this when I had a customer that put buttercream outside in the sun in the summer and wanted her money back because it melted. Somethings just aren\u2019t as common sense as you think. 3- deposits are always a good idea, don\u2019t feel bad about asking for one. I make people pay half down half at pick up if it\u2019s anything over $50. People no-show all the time", " NTA. Your coworkers that think you should give away something you created are AHs. Don't give away your intellectual property. \n\nI have recipes for my business as well as certification in areas. I have people ask me to hand it over for their continued profit. I declined. They thought I was an AH. I told them to take the course, pay the fee and do the damn work. Nothing is free. If it is free, (proven by your free cakes) it's a sneaky way for someone to get something out of it. Human nature. It is what it is", "NTA, she tried to grift you, and you didn't fall for it. Excellent job! You're going to use that recipe to make money, you can't just go around giving that info out! I would probably make a polite post on your business account saying that you aren't planning on giving out your custom recipes, as this is how you put food on the table.", "NTA I would respond to the review on your page and explain what happened.", "Togo is unlikely to buy nukes from the US... so should the US share their nuke secrets?    \nAn extreme example... but in line.", "NTA- I have several friends and family that have businesses like these. They use recipes they came up with or were passed down to them. They never give out the recipe or the secret ingredient that makes their cakes different than others just for this purpose and you shouldn't either. If she wants a specialty cake then she can put the time and effort into making one.", "NTA. Thats your IP.
