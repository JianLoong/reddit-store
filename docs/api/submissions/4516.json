My youngest, Paige, just entered her freshman year. She is normally a very happy girl but lately Paige has dreaded going to school and has even begged me not to go. No matter how many times I asked, she would not tell me why she hated school. \n\nI asked Eliza, who is a sophomore, to find out why Paige does not want to go to school. She did, and it turns out that Paige has been getting bullied at school and her peers have called her fat.\n\nNow, Paige is not a fat girl. She is very athletic and plays tons of sports. But she is a bit on the chubbier side. \n\nSince Paige wouldn\u2019t come to me about the issue, I figured I should not say anything to her about it. But I did decide that I could still be helpful by making healthier meals at home. I stopped picking up unhealthy, processed foods at the grocery store and instead stocked up on vegetables and whole foods.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I may be the AH: Paige asked me to pick up Oreos on my next trip to the store and I finally broke and told her that instead of turning to food, she could talk to me. Paige stormed upstairs and slammed her door. Even Eliza was upset with me.\n\nIt may have come out the wrong way, but I really didn\u2019t mean anything wrong by that. I just meant I am her mom and she can always come to me.

She wanted a snack. She wasn't \"turning to food\". \n\nYou've probably just made her feel even more fat.", "YTA. You say you have no concerns because Paige is athletic and plays \"tons of sports\". Then you decide to cut out household junk and start eating healthier as a family. This is great! Excellent! All positive stuff. \n\nBut then Paige makes a (perfectly normal) request and you accuse her of \"turning to food\". Turning to food because she had a bit of a sugar craving for an Oreo. Was she going to binge eat an entire pack? Do you feel she emotionally eats? Do you feel this is a problem she has? Because you started out your post by saying that she was into sports and there were no worries there. So what put the emotional eating idea in your head?\n\nMostly though YTA for not talking to Paige about ANY OF THIS. She could be struggling with a subject, a teacher, a crush. Her SISTER said it was bullying about her weight. Yet apart from your disparaging remark about \"turning to food\", you haven't spoken to Paige at all.", "So let me get this straight. You find out your daughter is being bullied at school due to her size and instead of talking to her about it, you just changed available foods and are withholding snacks? \n\nYTA for how you approached it (with the Oreos) and for not sitting down with your kid and talking the minute you found out what was going on.", "YTA because you're not honest with your daughter and didn't even address the bullying she's receiving at school.  Do better, mom.", "YTA. You assume a lot. Try talking to your child instead of assuming she\u2019s eating her feelings.", "YTA \n\nYou aren't helping your daughter at all.", "YTA and if you\u2019re not careful you will ruin her relationship to her body and food forever- even if you mean well! \nRestricting her will not fix her relationship with food- it will create irreversible damage.

Jfc, are you unable to put two and two together op?? You already said your daughter keeps refusing to go to school, even *I* figured out from that single sentence she was getting bullied. you didnt need to \"break trust\" with anyone, just have some common sense! but no! you decided this needed a \"delicate hand\" as if *dieting* was a better approach to this than *talking to the school*. Lastly, dieting takes MONTHS or even YEARS to see results, so are you just gonna keep this stupid secret for god knows how long?? Get off your ass, go to the school, talk to a professional, and help your daughter!", "YTA. Go apologize to her. Just say, \"I'm sorry, that was thoughtless of me.\" Don't make a huge deal out of it, because that will make everything  even more cringe. \n\nMaybe look into getting her some counseling. Make it clear you'd like her to have a professional to talk to since you can tell she's going through some stuff, based on how she begs you not to have to go to school. Do not say one word about her weight or eating habits.", "YTA- you made a bad call in the moment of how to handle it. She in all likelihood wasn\u2019t turning to food, she just wanted some Oreos.

The bullies are gonna bully her regardless of a couple extra pounds, they\u2019ll just find something else.", "YTA. You could have approached this in a much more sensitive and thoughtful way - but instead you shamed her.\n\nPaige plays a tonne of sports, right?

Bullied at school and bullied by her mom.", "Clearly you\u2019ve established that she in fact cannot come to you. She\u2019s being bullied at school and now at home.

Instead of approaching the issue as the problem is the bullying you are approaching it as if the problem is her size.\n\nYour child doesn\u2019t even sound overweight - she just sounds bigger than you. She\u2019s an athlete and has a different body shape. She\u2019s also going through puberty. But even if she was morbidly obese you don\u2019t approach weight concerns by subterfuge dieting.\n\nI\u2019ve seen what happens when \u201cwell-meaning\u201d parents do what you do. It leds to lifelong food issues. It leads to daughters not have a strong relationship with their mother.\n\nBy not approaching the issue directly you are indirectly giving the message that the bullies are right. She\u2019s being told from all sides, including by you, that her weight is a problem.\n\nHer weight is NOT the problem here. You should be teaching her to find pride and self worth even when others try to bring her down. You should be building up her confidence. \n\nYou are her mother. You need to be her biggest advocate. You may not agree with their methods but you agree with her bullies overall message. You have to do better.", "YTA You are just reinforcing the bullying she gets at school, no wonder she doesn't want to talk about it with you.", "Wait \u2026 so instead of going to the school and addressing what the actual problem is .. yano the fact that your child is being bullied .. you instead decided to try and make her lose weight and then as if that\u2019s not a shit enough reaction to what you found out , you then go and say that to her ? \n\nGo and apologise to your daughter and let her know that you will support her in getting the bullying dealt with cos right YTA and you need to fix this and fast before your daughter ends up with an ED because her own mother just backed up what they bullies were saying to her", "YTA. She\u2019ll end up w an ED", "YTA. You yourself said she\u2019s not a fat girl but now you\u2019re treating her like one.  Empower your children, don\u2019t make them feel worse.", "So instead of supporting your daughter agaisnt the bullies, you decided it was her that needed to change? Bullies will pick anything to use to bully people, what will you change about her next?  \n\n\nYTA", "Gentle YTA because what you did is messed up, but I think it comes from ignorance. Trust me, Paige has noticed you changing up the meals at home, and she'll internalize that to mean that you think she needs to lose weight too. Your comment about the oreos would have just confirmed that to her. You also turned her desire for oreos into something else entirely too, accusing her of using food to cope with emotions when you have shown no basis for that. Just... you really have made the situation worse.", "So yeah, YTA for 2 reasons. First for assuming she was worried about her weight (could be a boy she\u2019s avoiding), and second the insult of \u201cturning to food\u201d for comfort. Girls, especially, are very sensitive to comments about their eating habits and resulting weight. Just get off Reddit and apologize already!", "YTA. You need to address the bullying. You need to communicate with your child.", "YTA. The problem is that your child is being bullied. AKA emotionally attacked on a regular basis. The problem is not that she is \"on the chubbier side\". She needs support and comfort and help dealing with the abuse.\n\nSo what did you do?\n\nYou chose to side with the bullies and told her as clearly as you could that being overweight is the problem, and it's her fault she's being bullied.\n\nI seriously question your excuse for not talking to her about the bullying. What if you chose to say nothing because you agree with the bullies?\n\nParenthetically, is her sister sticking up for her at school? Or is she also leaving the child to fend for herself?", "YTA. I know you meant well, but you made a big, awkward deal out of a pack of Oreos. You accused your kid of eating away her feelings instead of talking to you, so you also made a pack of Oreos about you.", "YTA! What on earth were you thinking? People are making her feel awful & so you go behind her back because you agree? Then you essentially TELL her you agree? Good grief I cannot fathom the pain you have caused her.", "YTA. You know she is athletic and healthy but decided to use bullying against her to push your idea of how she should look? Really?", "YTA, you want to be someone who she can come to? Then start putting your words into actions. That means showing her that she can, all she sees right now is that you think the bullies are right and she is fat. You need to sit down with her and prove that you are a person she can trust.  Being her mother means f-all if all you\u2019re doing is making her more self conscious than she already is. And you betrayed the trust of your older daughter who probably won\u2019t do anything for you anymore, as what she got from it is she tries to help and you throw it in her face and she ends up being the villain.", "Holy cow, YTA. Shit like this only reinforces what the bullies say to kids that are being bullied. For a lot of people, their parents are their first bully, and with the way you\u2019ve reacted to your daughter being bullied makes me believe you are that kind of parent. What\u2019s worse is, based off your comments, you\u2019re not actually learning anything or planning to fix things with your daughter. You just posted this hoping people would agree with you.", "YTA.\n\n>> told her that instead of turning to food, she could talk to me\n\nYour kid wanting a snack does not automatically mean that she\u2019s using food as a crutch for her feelings. Even if she *is*, what you said imposes a helluva lot of shame on your daughter, and can cause her to associate snack foods with shame.\n\nYour daughter needs support for being bullied, not shame for wanting some Oreos, and you owe her an apology.", "YTA you blindsided her and confirmed what the bullies were saying.  You should have been a parent and spoken to her about the bullying sooner.", "You are definitely TA.\n\nPerhaps try finding ways to help her deal with her bullies in a healthy way, instead of turning to changing her appearance and eating habits. All you've done is become one of her bullies yourself.", "YTA So even her mom is bullying her about her weight? No wonder she didn't feel she could talk to you about it.", "YTA.  Oreos are not food, but dammit, I\u2019m going to buy a pack of double stuff if I wanna.  \n\nWent about it the wrong way.  You could have said \u2018, hey, as a family I think we need to start eating healthier so I\u2019ll be limiting the sweets/ junk food in the house going forward.  \u2018", "YTA.   You are NOT helping her.  Please tell me you got the damn Oreos!  It was obvious she didn\u2019t want to talk about it and now you\u2019ve made her feel like she\u2019s got an eating issue.  Next you\u2019ll be telling her you changed eating habits because of her.

If she is worried about her weight and comes to you then help her with that. It's not your place to make her feel the same way the bullies do. You said it yourself she's athletic and chubby. Would you say that to her? If the girl wants Oreos get the girl some damn oreos. Don't contribute to the hate.", "Gently, YTA.  And gently only because you didn\u2019t intend to do damage.  Although you certainly did.\n\nTrying to make everyone in the family healthier, good.  Provided that it isn\u2019t targeted at just her.\n\nBut. You just effectively told the one daughter that her sister shared private information with you. You decided that she has an eating disorder manifesting itself as emotional eating.  You told her that in an unsupportive manner; in a way that might actually precipitate an eating disorder.\n\nAnd good luck getting the older daughter to share information with you in the future.\n\nAND.  You ignored that bullying is not ok!  Would you have reacted differently if the bullying was because she was short or tall?", "YTA\n\nI understand you're trying to help your daughter, but this kinda thing is exactly how eating disorders get started. Please don't do that to your daughter. Don't talk about food as if it is inherently bad or make her feel like she is bad / wrong for wanting to eat certain things. A few Oreos here and there won't kill her. \n\nYou also need to deal with the actual problem - the bullying. Paige losing weight isn't the answer to that. She deserves to be treated with respect regardless of her shape or size. You should be a safe person for her to talk to about how much the bullying hurts. Unfortunately, it seems she doesn't feel safe talking to you about these things and your approach here gives a pretty good indication of why. Please sit with that.", "I have a cousin, her mum was like you, she started controlling what she ate so she didn\u2019t get any chubbier. by the time she was 15 she had been hospitalised for anorexia and a feeding tube placed, by 17 it had gotten so bad her heart physically shrunk and became so weak she couldn\u2019t even stand, now she\u2019s 22 and Is worse then ever because her mum can\u2019t force her into hospital anymore, over the years it has caused losses in bone density so now she has a broken vertebrae, thankfully she can still walk but her kidneys are slowly shutting down and honestly we\u2019re all just waiting for her to die because there is literally nothing else we can do, it sucks watching someone slowly die.", "YTA. Based on the comments it sounds like you favor Eliza because she\u2019s thin and you\u2019re ashamed of Paige for being larger.

It\u2019s not. AT ALL. \n\nThis is about the fact that your daughter is struggling because she\u2019s being bullied at school. She doesn\u2019t need to fix her food non-issue.

They're going to bully her no matter what size she is, and even if she was overweight that does NOT condone bullying!

You find out your daughter is being bullied, and instead of approaching the school to stop it, or getting her help or therapy so she can learn how to deal with it herself, you start putting the focus on her looks and diet and how she has to change her behaviour to suit her bullies.

Your bullies are right.\"\n3) It's great that you want the family to eat healthy, but this doesn't address the bullying issue. Bullying is not rational, and once a target is picked it doesn't matter what they change about themselves, the bullies will find their insecurities and exploit them. If she lost a lot of weight they'd make fun of that. Or just keep calling her fat since it clearly worked and often people (women especially) continue to think they need to lose weight even when it's actually quite unhealthy. Instead of trying to change your daughter, you need to go to school leadership or her teachers. The teachers may not have noticed the issue (kids are sneaky) but if they know to look for it they have a better shot at intervening (for example, not putting your daughter on a group project with her bullies, or cracking down more on note passing/whispered conversation.) \n4) if you actually think your daughter is eating to deal with her emotions, she clearly needs help figuring out a better way to handle those feelings. Many teens don't want to talk to their parents about stuff - that's normal and can be a healthy part of development if they have other outlets. Instead of pushing her to disclose to her, maybe offer some other options like \"you've seemed unhappy lately and I want to make sure you have any support you need. You know I'm here to talk, but if you'd rather I'd be happy to help you get a therapist or counselor, or set up time with another adult you trust\" that would show that it's not about you wanting something from her, but rather you wanting the best for her.\n\nYou can fix this, but you need to stop seeing her body as a problem to solve.", "YTA...

I realize you didn\u2019t think that way but it is effectively what you did so you\u2019re making it much worse. \n\n- Instead of waiting for her to approach you, you forced your skewed opinion on her AND she\u2019s now going to feel bad if she wants to eat something you wouldn\u2019t approve of. That\u2019s how eating disorders are born (amongst other ways). You showed her preemptively that even if she wanted to confide in you, you can\u2019t be trusted. \n\n- If you had a lot of processed food at home, it was a good idea for you to make sure your kids have quality food around and having cookies or junk food etc. occasionally is perfectly fine for any reasonably active kids/teens/adults. \n\n- You missed the chance to figure out together with your daughter how she really feels (Shame? Anger? Sadness?) about herself/ her body/ being bullied. \n\n- You don\u2019t have her back. \n\nThink about these things and get some good, professional advice on how YOU need to change before you can help your daughter. Then approach her with a sincere apology and see if you both can go from there. \n\nMaybe your daughter would be open to counselling? No idea if school counsellors are helpful where you are, so maybe find someone just for her.", "Hey, I\u2019m super morbidly obese and was also obese as a teen.

My youngest, Paige, just entered her freshman year. She is normally a very happy girl but lately Paige has dreaded going to school and has even begged me not to go. No matter how many times I asked, she would not tell me why she hated school. \n\nI asked Eliza, who is a sophomore, to find out why Paige does not want to go to school. She did, and it turns out that Paige has been getting bullied at school and her peers have called her fat.\n\nNow, Paige is not a fat girl. She is very athletic and plays tons of sports. But she is a bit on the chubbier side. \n\nSince Paige wouldn\u2019t come to me about the issue, I figured I should not say anything to her about it. But I did decide that I could still be helpful by making healthier meals at home. I stopped picking up unhealthy, processed foods at the grocery store and instead stocked up on vegetables and whole foods.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I may be the AH: Paige asked me to pick up Oreos on my next trip to the store and I finally broke and told her that instead of turning to food, she could talk to me. Paige stormed upstairs and slammed her door. Even Eliza was upset with me.\n\nIt may have come out the wrong way, but I really didn\u2019t mean anything wrong by that. I just meant I am her mom and she can always come to me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s easy to put your foot in your mouth and I think a lot of these comments are from people who forget that.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to see an issue and want to fix it. Making healthier choices for the household will help Paige. I think a better option for this scenario would have been something like \u201coh you know what, it\u2019s really hard for *me* to avoid Oreos when they\u2019re in the house so if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019m going to buy healthy snacks for the house\u201d. I know people will jump on me for this, but again, it\u2019s not unreasonable to want to make your family healthy. This biggest problem in this situation is language and drastic changes that are clearly directed at one person (Paige). My mother pushed diet culture on me so drastically as a child. Taking me to weight watchers, making me drink Slim Fast at 10 years old. Having me do weekly weigh-ins and setting up a reward system for weight loss. I could go on and on. I developed an eating disorder in 10th grade and with every pound I lost by not eating my mother would praise me. I\u2019m truly not sure what she could have said or done differently to avoid this because the truth is I did use food as comfort and I did overeat, it was probably really difficult for her to say nothing and let it happen, but what she did wasn\u2019t right either. I feel bad for you, it\u2019s truly a tough situation. Kids often even out though and you said yourself she\u2019s active. Maybe just letting her go through her stuff herself and pulling back is maybe the best option. Idk! I feel like I contradicted myself a couple times in this post haha it\u2019s very tough! I\u2019m currently pregnant with my first child, a daughter, and I am constantly worried of saying/doing the wrong thing with food. I just want her to be healthy and HAPPY and not have a complex.

That every human body is shaped differently, no matter what each person eats & exercises.\n\nAlso- restricting foods to the easiest way to form an eating disorder.

I hope that now you can see that you should have a conversation with Paige (even if she doesn't say anything back, just tell her these things) about how she can come to you if she wants to talk and that you'll support her in any changes she wants to make AND ALSO that your love in unconditional, even if she is fat, even if she eats Oreos, even if she isn't making friends at her new school and the other kids are mean to her, she needs to know that you won't love her more if she loses weight. I get that everything you've done has been from a good place of wanting to help her and care from her - you know, mom stuff - but she's at an age where she needs to be included in discussions and choices about her care and feeding, especially since if you want to help her you need her to buy in. The story you described is not you \"helping\" your daughter make choices, it's just you making choices for her and then saying you get to decide because she's fat. \n\nLay the foundation for her to decide that she wants to make healthy choices, make it clear that you're here for her either way, and that eating healthy IS NOT punishment for being heavy. In the meantime, focus on making gradual healthy changes in your house; make family meals healthier, etc. And remember, she's a teenager now, she'll get junk food whether it's in the house or not. My mom only kept healthy food in the house so my brother and I would split a whole family size pack of Oreos after school because we had to get them ourselves on the way home and make sure they were gone by the time our mom got home from work. This is great practice for drawing healthy boundaries around alcohol for your daughters: it's better that you don't make this a shame thing that she has to hide from you, because that makes it much more likely that it will get out of hand.\n\nPersonally I spent a lot of years trying to fully internalize that my mom's love is actually unconditional and not related to my ability to lose weight and be as skinny as her friends' kids, and that's been really unfortunate for our relationship over the years. Please don't start this cycle in your relationship with your own daughter. Btw I'm still fat now at 28 but I'm comfortable in my body and my mom and I are very close, despite living across the country from each other.

I\u2019d eat processed snacks once I\u2019m a while, and god I loved Oreos. then when I hit 12 or so, people started making the offhanded comments. Calling me a pig, saying I looked like I was pregnant, whatever. \n\nWelp, I hope they\u2019re happy, cause I haven\u2019t had an oreo in 6 years. \n\nPaige is already being bullied it seems. You say she\u2019s no longer happy. That\u2019s because she has a voice in her head of those bullies telling her the person she is and the way that she looks is something to be ashamed of. That eating is something to be ashamed of. Your comment reinforced that voice. I know that because people said the same thing to me. Yes, the voice says. You should be ashamed of turning to food, of wanting to eat that, of eating at all. With each validation the voice will grow stronger, telling her she isn\u2019t enough and that there\u2019s only one way to fix it. \n\nThis is where you have a choice, I think. \nYou can tell her she\u2019s perfect the way she is, that she can eat whatever food she wants, and that the bullies are wrong. That she\u2019s beautiful and that she has nothing to be ashamed of. You can take action at her school, even, to stop the bullying. That\u2019s what I wish people had told me or done before it was too late. I think that might have made the voice in my head falter a bit. \n\nOr you could continue to validate her deepest fears, tell her that she, not them, is the problem. You can attempt to change her diet and shame her for wanting to eat Oreos. And the voice will only grow stronger. That\u2019s the path you\u2019re on now. She was asking you to buy the Oreos, so maybe she was trying to fight it, but you told her to give in. \n\nI guess I\u2019ll finish my story so you know how it could end. The comments continued and the voice in my head grew stronger until I too gave in. I started \u201ceating healthy\u201d. It wasn\u2019t some epic switch, just small things- no sweets, tossing half my sandwiches, less carbs, more vegetables. No processed foods. No Oreos. You say she plays tons of sports. So did I. When you\u2019re burning lots of calories those small things add up. I lost 20 pounds in a couple of months. I too was a sophomore in high school, and my weight was in the 80s. I looked like a skeleton- and everyone loved it. I still got comments, but new ones now: how did you get so skinny? you look so good now. So beautiful. I wish I looked like you. It felt so good. But your body can only run for so long on empty. As soon as I gained the weight back, the offhand insults returned. I wasn\u2019t enough anymore. And ever since then I\u2019ve been chasing a high I\u2019ll never get back- my weight charts look like a roller coaster. I\u2019m graduating college now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be free. \n\nIf you take one thing away from this post take this: you have a healthy child. It\u2019s up to you whether she stays that way. I used to be healthy too. \nBut that initial bout of \u201ceating healthy and exercising\u201d that everyone loved so much? Making the exact changes you\u2019re telling Paige to make now? Well, it also fell at the age of 14 when bones are growing and solidifying. I have a 100 degree curve in my spine and four missing disks because of what I did. The medical cause the doctors have settled on is \u201cnutritional deficiency.\u201d I\u2019m in pain all the time.

I'm speaking from experience bc even though I didn't get bullied for it, my weight was a huge insecurity and caused a lot of damage to me mentally, and my mom would try to encourage me but it felt like she was giving me more pressure and couldn't love me how I was.
