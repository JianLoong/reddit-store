He's had this service dog for 6 years now, a lab named Maddie. We take her everywhere as his are caused by stress, so can be caused from a stressful situation too.\n\nBecause of his health his family never took him to a theme park, and so I brought it up. However we didn't want to leave Maddie behind, and you obviously can't take a dog on the rides. He has a Nephew whos had it rough this year & as a late Xmas gift we asked Nathan to come with on 2 conditions.\n\n1, I will pay for tickets, hotel, and gas ect. but he must have his own play money for food and gifts.\n\n2, we all take turns going on rides so that someone is with Maddie at all times. Nathan the Nephew agreed.\n\nWe have been here for a 3 hours, and Daniel (my fianc\u00e9) & myself wanted to get on a ride. Well we did but when we got off we found strangers holding Maddie & asking about what to do with her.\n\nDaniel and myself got Maddie back, and people lectured us for \"leaving a poor dog tied up who only wants to work.\"\n\nWe didn't, my nephew had tied her to a fence that keeps you away from the ride. We walked around, & couldn't find nephew.. Called him, his phone was off. \n\nI was livid, & Daniel started showing episode signs because he was stressed out. We searched for 30 minutes, before I left Daniel & Maddie with a worker & looked by myself. I found nephew getting off a ride, when I called out to him he ran off.\n\nOnce I caught him I flipped.\nNathan's excuse was, \"omg I'm a kid. I wanna have fun. I deserve a break too.

He gave me this opportunity..\" I couldn't hear the rest because his sobs slurred it too much.

I  reminded him that I was giving this opportunity, not Daniel.\n\nTo elaborate we did all switch who watched Maddie.

Not only life altering but expensive.\n\nI told Nathan that if he didn't watch Maddie I would drive him home, & drop him off. He flipped. He cried & ran off again.\n\nI didn't go after him, and returned to Daniel to find out from a worker they moved him and he had a seizure in a back area.

He flipped. He cried & ran off again.\n\nI really hope you're planning in following through with this, and not just have it be an empty threat. NTA. I would freak, I don't know if I'd even give him the second chance you offered...\n\nBut I do wonder if he has a developmental or mental/emotional disorder, because that's not normal behaviour for a 19-year old.", " \n\nHe's not a child he's 19. \n\nReading this, you could honestly think you were talking about a 7 year old. \n\nNTA\n\nYou did a nice thing, and unfortunately, your nephew behaved like an adult brat, endangered the poor dog, and then contributed to your partner having a seizure. \n\nI wouldn't be doing too much for the \"kid\" in the future.", "NTA\n\nAt 19 he is an adult and not a child. You gave him fair rules for a free, fun day out and he agreed to the rules. He had a great opportunity and he blew it.", "Your nephew might \u201cwant to be a kid,\u201d but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a young adult who agreed to help with the dog in exchange for the privilege of enjoying time at the park. You\u2019re NTA for expecting him to live up to the obligations he agreed to.", "Nobody seems to have capitalized on the point that he willingly risked that dog\u2019s wellbeing by leaving it alone to go ride rides.", "NTA,  I'm furious for you, anything could have happened to Maddie. You are very lucky she wasn't taken. Nephew has ruined any chance of being treated to a day out in the future.  He may have had a hard life but his behaviour is reminiscent of someone I know who just ignores boundaries.  I hope Maddie and your fiance are OK and yoat you can find your nephew,  get him home and get back to your own place to recover from this shock.", "NTA He\u2019s 19 years old. He could be serving in combat and instead he\u2019s crying because he had to sit out in a third of the rides on this free trip to help his uncle and take care of a living service animal. What a joke.", "NTA: a 19 year old adult should not be crying about having to wait to go on a ride.  Abandoning a dog is a horrible thing to do as well.  Send him home\u2014you and you fianc\u00e9 deserve to have a fun /relaxing time.", "NTA. The nephew is an adult who entered into a reasonable agreement and didn't live up to it, whether he wants to be grown up or not. The young \"adult\" needs to be clobbered with a clue-by-four.", "NTA - Do not leave the dog or a loved one in his care. He is not emotionally or socially developed to be trusted. He did not stay on task and created a plan to get his needs met. Your fianc\u00e9e is a father figure yet the 19y put the dog in harms way which caused him to seizure. He's acting on impulse while articulating he can't help it cause he didn't have things. Until he proves otherwise his personal interests and needs will override any commitment he makes. This can lead to dangerous outcomes given he is no longer a minor. Best to you.", "This whole thing is weird because the nephew is 19 and 19 year olds don\u2019t act like that. \n\nDoes the nephew have any disabilities?\n\nAlso if your nephew has run off\u2026 shouldn\u2019t you NOT be on Reddit and go find him? \n\nGood luck", "NTA.\n\nMany people have terrible home lives; that doesn't give them a pass to act like a self-centered jerk at 19. I don't even believe he was actually crying. Imo, he just wanted to do what he wanted, and when he saw you were angry and he was actually going to be held responsible for going back on his agreement, he poured on the waterworks and gave you a sob story. I literally had to go back to check on his age, because he behaved like a small child. He's 19. He should have stood by his agreement. The dog matters too. It was very unsafe to leave it alone. It could have been hurt or stolen, and this dog is medically necessary.\n\nTo give the benefit of the doubt to your nephew, his actions could be a result of his poor upbringing and homelife. Don't back down though. Tell him how glad you were that he got to experience some of an amusement park, but explain how his actions impacted everyone, and why this is wrong, and what he should do in the future. I'd try to stay as neutral as possible. The crying is his own issue. I hope he sees a good therapist because he has a lot to work out.", "NTA\n\nThis \"kid\" is legally an adult at 19.  He knew he did wrong, which is why he ran.  He is manipulating you with his sob story.  And the stress he caused your fianc\u00e9 did real damage.  There should be some consequences for his actions.", "NTA.\n\nNathan is not a kid.  He's 19 acting like a 5 year old.\n\nPoor doggy.", "NTA. Nathan needs to act his age and not leave your service animal unattended.", "NTA. First, sorry your fiance had an episode I hope he feels alright soon, OP.\n\nSecond,  nephew is 19, not 9 so NOT A CHILD, despite acting like one. He failed in his mission to watch a service dog for 5 whole minutes,  turned off his phone and then ran like a coward when confronted. \n\nPlease, do take him home after this horrid behavior. Once your fiance is safe. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA at all, Nathan is 19, if asking him to wait here and there with the dog isn\u2019t doable for him then I don\u2019t know what is. He got a free day at an amusement park and this is how he repays you? This isn\u2019t just ADHD and anxiety, this is much much more. I can\u2019t believe he tried to pull this stunt and act like the victim. Something is seriously wrong and he needs help.", "NTA.  \n\n\nyou brought your nephew also.  \nIt sucks he did not have his childhood but does not mean that he gets to act like a child when is 19.  \n\n\nIf you want to go on a ride switch and then ride. Which I am assuming was done based on the info given.  \n\n\nBut leaving a service dog tied where who know what could happen and not facing up to the question is a big red flag.", "NTA the expectations seem to have been clearly set from the beginning. The nephew is being extremely manipulative and his lack of consideration caused his uncle to have a seizure and endanger his service dog.", "NTA\n\nHe's not \"just a kid\", he's a 19 year old who is now technically an adult. He's well old enough to know what he did was wrong, VERY wrong, as anyone could have walked off with Maddie. Not only that, due to his immature and irresponsible actions, Daniel had a seizure, in a very public setting. \n\nIt's not like you were making him watch Maddie for every ride. He agreed to the deal you made and because he's selfish and uncaring, just did what he wanted. Then he turned on the waterworks to guilt you, which I'm wondering how often he did this with his mom to get out of trouble (my friend's 17yo son does this a lot but she doesn't buy it any longer).", "Are you sure you got the ages right? Because that behaviour would have been expected from a 9 yo and you would have been an A for expecting a kid that age to stay alone with the dog, but at 19, he is no kid but an b adult and one good at manipulating others, that's for sure. NTA. Don't you ever take that brat anywhere ever again.", "NTA", "NTA that's incredibly irresponsible on your nephew's part.", "NTA- \n\nIf someone needs a service animal, it's reasonable not to take it into/onto things that are intentionally scary/uncomfortable/super loud. \n\nIf he knew it was his responsibility, leaving was not OK. And 19 is absolutely old enough to understand that. \n\nI would probably have said \"No, you're not.\" if a 19 year old tried to say they are a kid. I'm sorry, in the US you are legally an adult. If you're old enough to sign up to go to war you are damn well old enough to watch a dog for a few minutes.", "NTA, he\u2019s acting like a 5 year old, you made a deal, and he abandoned the service dog \n\nEpileptic or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures?\n\nIf the latter I wonder if nephew views the issue less seriously", "NTA. He\u2019s 19, not a kid. Something bad could have happened to Maddie and instead of taking responsibility he goes to emotional manipulation.", "NTA and honestly, I\u2019m really proud of you for not punching him there and then. The audacity\u2026", "Um, he\u2019s 19. Not a kid. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour conditions were clear. Rough childhood or not, he's an adult and should be perfectly capable of following those simple conditions.", "Nta to me.. you gave him 2 conditions for him to join you and he agreed to those terms\u2026.\n\nHe failed. \n\nHe can be an adult at 19 and enjoy the rides without interference on his own time by going to the park by himself or with friends.\n\n\nMaybe consider paying a dog sitter to watch the dog at the park next time if you choose to go again in the future\u2026", "NTA because the expectations were clear and reasonable.\n\nBut I am curious - if you hadn\u2019t invited Nathan as a kind gesture, would you and your fianc\u00e9 not have gone on any rides together at all?  You would have had to take turns waiting on line and riding the rides one at a time?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is way too old for this kind of behavior, regardless of his personal issues.
