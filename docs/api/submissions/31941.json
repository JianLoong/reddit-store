David broke up with his toxic ex earlier this year. She was insecure in the \"I'd be more comfortable if you blocked all your female friends\" way. She made his life hell for a year but David stayed with her that long because he loved their sex life. He recently got a new girlfriend Haley (23F). She's a very nice and unproblematic girl.

He's slept with 5 in total. None of them were more than 2 years younger but I still find it weird that around half the girls he's slept with were virgins. He's also made a couple of weird comments. When he was telling us about Haley, it came up that she was a virgin and he said he \"picks them well.\" He's also mentioned that because of Haley's inexperience, \"she doesn't have baggage\" (referring to his toxic ex who had baggage). \n\nAnyways, it's unsurprising to me that a girl who went 23 years without dating might not a super sexual being. So while David was complaining, I asked him isn't that what he wanted? He seemed happy that she was a virgin and now he's complaining that it's too obvious she's a virgin in bed. \n\nThis caused an argument. David denied liking that she was a virgin and denied preferring virgins in general. Eric and Greg agreed that it was a fucked up call out. David said that how he feels is valid and Haley needs to consider his feelings. To which I responded that they probably aren't a good fit sexually and he needs to stop dating virgins if sex is that important to him. \n\nThis has caused a bit of a rift. Eric privately messaged me saying he agrees that David seems to have a weird thing for virgins and he shouldn't complain about Haley (thanks for sticking up for me in front of everyone dude).

You admit he\u2019s never stated he prefers virgins, but does prefer women with less relationship/emotional baggage.

This age is an important time for maturation and you're trying to help David. He likes virgins and gets a thrill but it's all surface level and he's not focusing on compatibility which is what you were trying to tell him. He got his ego hurt because he felt judged and lashed out but you seem like a close friend group so you guys probably know him pretty intimately and you've cut deep to the center of his own baggage. He feels vulnerable and upset so I'd still be compassionate and try to help him grow past this rather than let him get more defensive and internalize things.\n\nIf he's unsatisfied with his sex life, he needs to communicate that to his partner without judgement and encourage her in specific ways for what he likes and ask specifically what she likes or wants to try or could get her in the mood. Lots of other comments are suggesting he's bad in bed and I will say, I've personally had a lot guy friends who never try anything new or communicate and have unsatisfying sex, but at least a couple of those guys read a sex-psychology book or talked to friends, women, and got advice to remedy the situation. If it truly is a matter of libido mismatch, he should in the future look for someone with higher sex drive and similar kinks. He might benefit also from looking for a partner who has desirable positive qualities like kindness, communicative, centered, etc; rather than looking for a partner who doesn't have undesirable qualities like poor anger management and communication skills. If he's always running from his ex and looking behind him, he's not going to find the right path ahead of him.\n\nFinally, your friend with no backbone didn't help you or David and seems to be afraid to share his personal opinions or is overly concerned with pleasing others. He should at least be able to stand behind you rather than leaving you in the fray and making it seem like you're just an asshole who is attacking David. I'm not saying he had to die on this hill but at least chime in with a \"Actually David, I agree that this could be good advice.\" Just knowing several of his friends feel this way would've made David more receptive to hearing it. If I were in your place I'd tell him that while I appreciate his support, it would've been better in the moment and that you and your other friends WANT to hear what he has to say so he should speak up in these important moments.

I didn't become confident within months it took a good year of trying before I felt comfortable about sex with my now husband we were just dating then.
