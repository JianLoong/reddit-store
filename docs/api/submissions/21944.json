These two young ladies have some serious issues. It appears without intervention from a professional their behavior will only escalate. You may want to admit to yourselves that you are both in way over your head. Get these girls some professional help... ASAP!\n\nNTA", "NTA - I would not let your daughter live with someone clearly racist. Y\u2019all need to move out. Like seriously.", "Ouch. Low Blow for Low Blow. Your family isn\u2019t blending well and your therapist isn\u2019t getting the job done. NTA because punishment of some sort needs to happen, but there has to be a group therapy session. This sucks so bad for everyone.", "So, Emile got racist and destroyed her step sister property, so had to replace it with her own?\n\nNot an AH move for that, but she does have to have a bed. \n\nMaybe a better solution would be that you get her single sized bed, and if she wants a better one, she pays for that.", "NTA\n\nThat's what you call asymmetric warfare.  It went from a sister fight to a racist destruction of property.  That requires a consequence and therapy because that did not come out of no where.  In regards to the \"punishment\", what does her dad and your mom think is appropriate?  That you and your wife buy a new mattress set?  There is only one person who needs to face this consequence and that's Emile.  It's not like she is some little kid who does not know better, she's 15!!!  Maybe the other option is to take the defaced mattress, paint over it and place a plastic sheet on it and let her sleep on that.", "NTA. Jenny started this fight but Emilie escalated it to hate crime adjacent bs. That\u2019s not acceptable. Jenny had her punishment, now Emilie gets hers.", "NTA\n\n>For context Jenny is mixed, and Emile spray painted slurs on her new bed frame and mattress.\n\nNo way this can be tolerated at all. I think you punishment fits the crime honestly so NTA from me. I'd say however give her a week on the couch and if you can replace the frame and have her just pay you back the rest over time. It is a bit mean to force them to a couch.", "NTA, I was ready to assume you were giving your daughter preferential treatment but you and your wife are correctly responding to a disgusting act of racism and vandalism from your stepdaughter. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the racism stems from her father. The fact that he\u2019s seemingly angry would support that idea. Good that you\u2019re already in family therapy. That being said it is a bit inhumane to tell her she should sleep on the floor.", "You've got much bigger problems than this sub is equipped to deal with. I don't think making your stepdaughter sleep on the floor or couch is the right answer, making them swap beds would have been a better thing to do. You need to ALL be in family therapy right now.", "NTA\n\n***For context Jenny is mixed, and Emile spray painted slurs on her new bed frame and mattress.***\n\nQuite frankly, the 'punishment' is light, considering she did the above and that's not touching on the fact that she was a straight up asshole with the dad comments and got a slap on the wrist. Racism is never okay, not calmly, not in the heat of the moment. NEVER. And at 15, she should already know this.", "NTA. A 15year old should be mature enough to not spray paint slurs. She's being a bully, a racist one at that. And as they say, racism is taught. Make sure that her parents aren't racists themselves.", "NTA, but has Emilie ever said anything racist before or expressed racist opinions? Because this is something you need to get to the root of. Her behaviour was way out of line, but you should also have a serious talk with her about racism and how calling people slurs make them feel. She need to know not only that this was wrong, but also why.", "NTA, play stupid games win stupid prizes. Emillie knew what she was doing was wrong and still did it. Jenny had appropriate consequence for saying something unacceptable and now Emillie gets her due consequence for ruining an expensive bed. INFO, has she been racist before?", "NTA, somewhat..., though I would buy Jenny a new bed while Emile works it off and let Emile keep her bed. That said, I wouldn't tolerate living in a house where my child isn't safe from stuff like this. Home should be a safe haven, not another place Jenny has to worry about being hated and bullied because of her skin color/ethnic makeup. I absolutely, 100% wouldn't tolerate it, I don't care how much I loved my spouse, having a little racist gremlin as a step kid wouldn't fly period, never mind when my kid is a target of the racism.", "NTA\n\nEmile ruined Jenny's bed, Jenny gets her bed and Emile must pay for fixing what she ruined. Sounds only fair to me.\n\nHad she said those slurs in the heat of the discussion... But she spray-painted them on her bed. What was she expecting?\n\nPut her mattress on the floor and she can sleep there. A bed isn't a necessity, a good mattress is.\n\nEdit: Emily doesn't have to sleep on the floor, she can sleep on the bed and mattress she ruined.", "ESH. you need to get both the girls help. they are stuck in this situation because you and your wife made a choice. \n\nYour daughter said hurtful words your stepdaughter upped that stakes with not only distruction of property and racism. \n\nIt was a deliberate an act of racism and is lucky your daughter has not went a pressed charged for her actions. Since she bought  the item herself.\n\nYou and your wife and her ex need to find away to sort this out before  you both lose your daughters", "INFO - why don\u2019t you buy Jenny a new bed and make Emile pay you back? Emile should definitely be responsible for the damage she caused but it doesn\u2019t seem fair to make Jenny sleep on a much smaller bed until her stepsister earns the money to replace her old one.", "INFO: How much does the bed cost?", "NTA. Emilie took what could be considered a normal fight between new step siblings to a completely unacceptable level. Something needed to be done to shut that down *now*. The people who are saying that the punishment is too harsh don\u2019t seem to understand just how serious this can become if it isn\u2019t stopped now. And, considering her father\u2019s response, I\u2019m now wondering where she got it from.", "I'm going to say ESH except for the girls.\n\nI'm mixed as well and can put in my two cents.\n\nBut, removing her bed and forcing her to sleep on the couch or the floor because the adults in this story dropped the ball isn't going to make Emile less racist. \n\nIf anything, it's going to make things worse. Was the girls even introduced and allowed to know each other? When Emilie did this, why didn't you send her to her father's house instead? Hell, when you did therapy sessions, why focus on separate sessions and not a mix of both? \n\nIt sounds like y'all was trying to mix families after the marriage instead of before the marriage.", "NTA\n\nShe ruined her sister's bed on purpose, with hate speech and slurs what a fuckin charmer, so she lost her bed. She faced the consequences of her actions. Good parent, cookie.", "There doesn't seem to be any favoritism here.  When Jenny was wrong, she was punished appropriately.  Emilie ruining something your daughter worked and saved for calls for exactly the kind of punishment you're applying.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Emile's behaved in a racist manner towards her step sister. It's one thing for people to argue and fight.  What Emile did, however, crossed a line into something entirely unacceptable. The consequence/punishment is for her to make restitution. As such, the punishment fits the crime.\n\nAs long as you and your wife are united on this punishment, you're good.", "Honestly I get why you did it but YTA. It is beyond messed up to remove a child's bed.", "NTA. Way to go", "Nta and honestly you guys are parenting goals. You're teaching her to be responsible for her actions and it's not overly harsh and I LOVE that mom backed you up. I feel like it's so much worse when one parent messes up the team work.", "YTA what is this punishment doing? It\u2019s just building more resentment! You\u2019ve only just put more of a target on your daughters back? This isn\u2019t a mild fight over two four year old wanting the same train set! This is a way bigger issue and involves racism.
