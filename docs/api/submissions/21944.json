We both have primary custody of our kids. My daughter took the transition decently while my stepdaughter (Emile 15) did not. So family therapy mostly with her mom and her but I and Jenny will come in for some sessions when wanted. \n\nOverall I thought it was going okay. Jenny got a job the moment summer started, she use to have a twin bed but when Emilie moved in with her queen size bed that\u2019s all she wanted. So she basically saved all her money and bought herself an queen bed frame and new mattress. She loved it.\n\nThe two kids got in an argument, it started out over bread but got more heated. My daughter made a comment about about Emilie\u2019s dad not giving a shit, it was unacceptable. She got her phone taken away for a week, had a lecture, banned from her club for the week, and of course apologized. We talked about getting her to do therapy also but that got interrupted.\n\nFor context Jenny is mixed, and Emile spray painted slurs on her new bed frame and mattress. So my wife and I made the decision that Emilie\u2019s bed would go to Jenny until she buys Jenny what she ruined it\u2019s going to be expensive but she has a job. Also lost in privileges for a month. Her options are sleep on the floor or the couch.\n\nI got a call from her father and he went off, I told my mom what happens and she also thinks I am an asshole for this punishment\n\nSo update: after a long talk with Emilie, she handed over the money for the new bed she had enough in her savings from her job and Christmas money.  My wife handled the racism talk and had a long conversation about her ex husband with her daughter about him basically abandoning her. Individual therapy for both\n\nAlso for people saying a dig at her father is just as bad as destroying property with spray paint and slurs is just wrong. One was words and the other was a physical destroying property.
