My manager is rude and disrespectful and thinks very poorly of us workers. She holds herself on high pedestal. She has complained and yelled/cussed me out a few times for things. But I had an emergency on Sunday and I couldn\u2019t go back to work for the rest of the workday (it\u2019s a spilt shift job). I feel like she would complain to me about me not returning. I did text her and tell her I had an emergency and couldn\u2019t return but she never responded.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
