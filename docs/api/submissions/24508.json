Because your DIL is in a high risk pregnancy right now, one that puts not only the baby, but her in a possible life-threatening situation. I live in a country with universal health care, so I was able to be under constant medical care, but in your case you have to look out for her. Every stress has to be avoided, she has to be able to relax and taken care for all of her daily needs. She literally can only get up to go to the bathroom and maybe a short walk outside per day. Fighting with someone can lead to miscarriage and until she reaches the hospital the blood loss can already be fatal.\n\nPlease DO NOT send your son over \"to sort things out\" right now or make him move back in now. They cannot sort anything out without putting 2 lives in danger.

One time my sister dumped her husband of 6 months so she could chase a millionaire. My family took the side of the dumped son in law and she had to leave town for awhile, haha.", "Or he can rent a place and pay rent and not get murdered \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Thank you, we are all fine now and healthy. I just got flashbacks when reading OPs post and want to make sure they are taking the situation serious.", "exactly", "Exactly, guys with no control baffle me. I\u2019m only in my first trimester and my husband is aware that I\u2019m not really feeling my best and our bedroom life is kinda on pause unless I\u2019m feeling super good that day. A good husband would walk on fire for you, not walk into the arms of another woman.", "Do you live in the real world?", "My money is on the commenter you're responding to.", "How did it all play out in the long run? Did she get the millionaire?", "Yeah, it isn\u2019t an either/or situation where he either stays with his parents or dies horribly lol", "Or go stay with his hookup \ud83d\ude16", "Right but probably not right when he gets out of work. \n\nLike if you had to rent a place because you became homeless 4 minutes ago could you do it before bed time?", "Yep, I could. find a motel 6 or some other cheap shitty hotel. It's really not difficult at all.", "He made his lack-of-a-bed. He can sleep in it.\n\nIf family meant anything to him, he wouldn't have destroyed his over selfish lack of impulse control.", "Use your brain. Like Devilsbullet said, he can get a damn hotel room for the night, call a friend, etc. and then figure it out. He doesn't need to rent a room before midnight. DUH!", "Depends where you live doesn\u2019t it?", "I am defending the mom not him.\n\nThis sub is like sharks smelling chum.", "True. I can't speak for other countries. But I doubt there's many if any places in the contiguous 48 that are more than an hour away from a cheap shitty hotel.", "I'm responding directly to your last comment in the chain and not your argument to defend his Mom which I don't care for, I won't excuse her enabling either.\n\nI'm saying the whole last part of that comment is irrelevant because it doesn't matter how long it would take him to find a home. He brought it on himself. He won't die because he fucked up and might have to sleep in his car overnight.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 that\u2019s the best description I have heard for this subreddit in general."]}
