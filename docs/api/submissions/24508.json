I was rushed into the hospital and not only put on bedrest, but given iv infusions to prevent any sort of cramping. I was not allowed to get out of bed more than 20 mins per day. I was put into the room closest to the operating room as they said as soon as I started bleeding it was an instant emergency. I was in there for 4 weeks and the first 2 weeks were nerve wracking as the risk of bleeding and subsequent early delivery was high and the baby would have been too immature to survive.\n\nAfter 4 weeks I was up for longer than advised and fought with my mother because my (then) husband couldn't solve an issue with her on his own and put it on me. That night I got cramps and bleeding and my son had to be delivered with emergency c-section.\n\nWhy do I say this? Because your DIL is in a high risk pregnancy right now, one that puts not only the baby, but her in a possible life-threatening situation. I live in a country with universal health care, so I was able to be under constant medical care, but in your case you have to look out for her. Every stress has to be avoided, she has to be able to relax and taken care for all of her daily needs. She literally can only get up to go to the bathroom and maybe a short walk outside per day. Fighting with someone can lead to miscarriage and until she reaches the hospital the blood loss can already be fatal.\n\nPlease DO NOT send your son over \"to sort things out\" right now or make him move back in now. They cannot sort anything out without putting 2 lives in danger. She will be upset when she sees him and that alone puts her in great risk.\n\nI know you're upset too and don't want to see your son right now, but for the sake of the DIL and baby you have to control him so that he doesn't call her again and doesn't visit. Can you make sure she has everything she needs, gets good food and her house cleaned? She needs to be your no 1 concern right now, you need to ensure both survive the birth of your grandchild. Once this is done they can start mending their marriage.\n\nYour son has to understand that his wife is in immediate danger, and every stress and fighting can literally kill her. If he's got one unselfish bone inside him, he leaves her alone and supports her difficult pregnancy.", "The one thing I know about kids is that they come preloaded.
