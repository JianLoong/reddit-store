There was a huge event coming up that I was really excited to go to! I asked my boyfriend (27) 3 days before the event to accompany me and he said yes. So originally, the plan was my boyfriend, my step sister and myself. \n\nOn the day of the event, he said be had a doctor\u2019s appointment so he isn\u2019t sure if he can still attend. I said No Problem and and I waited for him to return home. A couple hours later he texted me and said he has something to tell me. I got worried and called him immediately. I asked if everything was okay and he said he was diagnosed with anemia so he\u2019ll have to take supplements. \n\nI expressed how sorry I was and spoke to him for about 2 hours, gave him pep talks, told him I\u2019m here if he needs me, reassured him that I will always love him / etc. I then asked if he would still like to attend the event with me to take his mind off of things to which he responded that he doesn\u2019t like the artistes performing so he\u2019d rather go another event. I said No Problem, I will go with my stepsister alone. He got upset and hung up. \n\nI called him back but he started an argument about how I\u2019m selfish for going out while he\u2019s going through something. I told him that I already made the plans with my step sister and I can\u2019t back out now as she\u2019s depending on me. I also don\u2019t drink so I would have been the sober driver - and if I didn\u2019t go, she couldn\u2019t. I told him that this event is the only event my sister really wanted to attend and I promised her that I would take her months prior. I even told him I\u2019ll see him the next day and he said be safe and hung up. \n\nI got to the event around 11 and spent the entire event alone just sitting down and watching the show by myself - having food and drinks. When I returned home around 2am, I called him and he was awake playing video games. \n\nHis first words were \u201clook who cares about me again\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m too tired for this\u201d and he responded by saying that of course I\u2019m tired - I went out without him knowing he\u2019s upset but I love partying and meeting new people so much that I didn\u2019t think to stay with him on the phone. I told him he\u2019s being ridiculous and I would have stayed if it were just us who planned to go. He said my priorities are off and I\u2019m an ignorant AH. \n\nKeep in mind, I don\u2019t attend parties unless it\u2019s with my family and I only attend events a few times a year. \n\nSo, AITA for not staying on the phone with him and attending the event instead?\n\nEdit: Formatting on mobile", "created_utc": 1676765341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115w9ao/aita_for_not_cancelling_my_plans_after_my/", "score": 2694, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's understandable that your boyfriend may be upset, as he just received a medical diagnosis and was looking forward to spending time with you at the event. However, it's also important to prioritize your commitments and promises, especially when someone else is depending on you.\n\nBased on the information provided, it doesn't seem like you did anything wrong by attending the event with your step sister as originally planned. You did take the time to talk with your boyfriend for 2 hours and offer support, and you had already made a commitment to your step sister. Additionally, you were going to be the sober driver for the event, which is a responsible thing to do.\n\nThat being said, it may be helpful to have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you can support him during this time and address any underlying issues in your relationship. It's important to listen to his concerns and try to find a solution that works for both of you. It's also important to set boundaries and communicate your own needs in the relationship.\n\nOverall, it's important to prioritize both your commitments and your relationships, and to communicate openly and honestly with those around you.", "Does he also have a paper cut? \n\nHe is ridiculously dramatic and selfish.

Are we sure he wasn\u2019t diagnosed with being too damn dramatic?!? \n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s scary, and totally warrants a 2hr talk and understanding that you\u2019re there for him. \nBut does it mean you can\u2019t go out for a few hrs.? Not really.", "NTA\n\nIf he had been diagnosed with something potentially terminal or at the least very serious that was an immediate health threat I could see getting mad.

Even in my case, when we found out from a follow-up blood test I was only a thin margin away from needing to be hospitalized if my hematocrit had gotten any lower, I was still perfectly fine. Capable of driving, working, exercising, doing chores - all your normal daily life activities.\n\nHe is trying to milk this and anemia is really no big deal. You don't need to curtail anything you're doing, you don't need \"emotional support\" for it, you just need to take a daily supplement and get more iron rich food into your diet.\n\nThe fact he went into a super-sulk over you not coddling him because he needs to eat some more steak (oh no how awful) and/or remember to take a daily supplement says a lot though.\n\nBy the way I recommend Vitamin Code Healthy Blood, I tried a range of iron supplements but that one worked great and it was easy on my stomach.

Unless it's aplastic anemia-which can require a bone marrow transplant to keep the person going on their own- or a result of the bf's body being damaged in such a way as to make mineral and vitamin absorption impossible, anemia isn't a life changing diagnosis.

You can get iron supplements at the grocery store, you don't even need a prescription.", "Nta. He still could have joined you. He's not that seriously ill, otherwise he would be in hospital.

He's being a drama queen.", "NTA at all. Does your over dramatic BF know how many people in The world are anaemic\u2026.it\u2019s a lot. We just pop a few supps and go about our normal business!

I was expecting cancer or something. \n\nThe boy is anemic and is acting like it's some huge thing. Yes, being anemic can be serious but it being to the point of it being serious is rare.  If he only needs to take supplements and not needing immediate IV iron infusions then it isn't that bad.  And most people who need to get iron infusions aren't in some urgent medical need. Nor is it some rare condition. Lots of people have to take iron supplements. You can get them over the counter.   I used to have to take them during my period. \n\nWow. Like I don't mean to  be insensitive.  But he's acting like a drama queen. And the fact you had to tell him that you will love him no matter what over this??? \n\nWhat am I missing here???\n\nETA: this all sounds incredibly manipulative to me.  Huge red flag.  I really think you should tell him \"you know what? After some serious thought, I have decided that I don't want to be with someone as sick and unhealthy as you!

It's not like he's dying and the main concern I'd have for him is the painful iron shits he's about to experience with the treatment.  He sounds like a baby and may need some time to grow up.  He's clearly fine enough to play video games and fine enough to guilt trip you for not babying him.", "Wait his song is dance is about ANEMIA? something more than half the population has? It didnt even need a 2 hour pep talk and your bf is spoiled and privileged. You are NTA.", "Anaemia? Rlly that's what he's whining about?

Guilt tripping (especially over something small) is a sign of manipulative and narcissistic behavior. Don\u2019t let him bully you.

Sort of narcissistic and non empathetic that he can\u2019t see this from your SIL\u2019s perspective nor your perspective.

Also, the answer can be no, and that's also okay. He can be upset about it but it isn't fair to try to make you feel guilty or like you did something wrong because you haven't. That is on him to regulate those emotions. \n\nAlways starting an argument about you going out, the way he reacted to you going out...those things seem like there's definitely something deeper that should be addressed.

There was a huge event coming up that I was really excited to go to! I asked my boyfriend (27) 3 days before the event to accompany me and he said yes. So originally, the plan was my boyfriend, my step sister and myself. On the day of the event, he said be had a doctor\u2019s appointment so he isn\u2019t sure if he can still attend. I said No Problem and and I waited for him to return home. A couple hours later he texted me and said he has something to tell me. I got worried and called him immediately. I asked if everything was okay and he said he was diagnosed with anemia so he\u2019ll have to take supplements. I expressed how sorry I was and spoke to him for about 2 hours, gave him pep talks, told him I\u2019m here if he needs me, reassured him that I will always love him / etc. I then asked if he would still like to attend the event with me to take his mind off of things to which he responded that he doesn\u2019t like the artistes performing so he\u2019d rather go another event. I said No Problem, I will go with my stepsister alone. He got upset and hung up. I called him back but he started an argument about how I\u2019m selfish for going out while he\u2019s going through something. I told him that I already made the plans with my step sister and I can\u2019t back out now as she\u2019s depending on me. I also don\u2019t drink so I would have been the sober driver - and if I didn\u2019t go, she couldn\u2019t. I told him that this event is the only event my sister really wanted to attend and I promised her that I would take her months prior. I even told him I\u2019ll see him the next day and he said be safe and hung up. I got to the event around 11 and spent the entire event alone just sitting down and watching the show by myself - having food and drinks. When I returned home around 2am, I called him and he was awake playing video games. His first words were \u201clook who cares about me again\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m too tired for this\u201d and he responded by saying that of course I\u2019m tired - I went out without him knowing he\u2019s upset but I love partying and meeting new people so much that I didn\u2019t think to stay with him on the phone. I told him he\u2019s being ridiculous and I would have stayed if it were just us who planned to go. He said my priorities are off and I\u2019m an ignorant AH. Keep in mind, I don\u2019t attend parties unless it\u2019s with my family and I only attend events a few times a year. So, AITA for not staying on the phone with him and attending the event instead?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As well as being rude to you which makes me think he is blowing it up purely as he didn\u2019t want to go. That he\u2019s using it as an excuse and thought he could get you to cancel and baby him.

I really do hate minimizing anyone\u2019s mental health at getting bad news cause we can all feel a sense of doom on bad news, but wow", "This is one of the most ridiculous responses to anemia that probably exists.

No, I'm dead now because of this sheer stupidity.", "This man sounds insufferable and insecure not only did he whine for two hours he expected you to stay ON THE PHONE with him all night to feed into his delusion that he has a terminal or life changing illness.

You are NTA but manipulative, controlling and insecure men are a toxic combination", "You know that your problem isn't the diagnose of him but his manipulating behaviour?

He will use his liw iron so often now to fish for sympathy.", "Oh honey, he's manipulating you. Being told you're anemic is barely a diagnosis, in most cases it's like being told you're dehydrated!\n\nWhen I was told I was anemic I wasn't even given iron tablets, I was told to eat more red meat and greens!\n\nYou called him at 2am and he was at home playing video games.... He's not ill, he's not dying, but was willing to pretend he was to stop you going to an event he said he wasn't even interested in going to!\n\nHe's trying to control you!

From someone who has it and has had it for years to the point sometimes I can't donate blood because my iron's too low, it's not that big a deal. Sometimes you get tired. You take iron supplements.

It IS controlling. And btw, that 'I'm dying' comment is bullshit. He's trying to make himself into a victim and make you the bad guy. It's frigging anemia. Boohoo. You're allowed to be looked at by other men. Like, so what if someone looks at you? What are you supposed to do, gouge their eyes out? Yell at them? Cause a scene? Because it sounds like he expects that.

Be kind to yourself and dump this man.", "That's insanely controlling. Most controlling or abusive people don't outright say \"don't do this or that\" instead they manipulate, shame and make you feel guilty for doing perfectly normal things. This guy is very controlling from everything you have described here....", "So everyone around you is telling you he is controlling. Do the people around you typically try to hurt you? What I mean is if EVERYONE is telling you it\u2019s a problem it\u2019s probably a problem. This whole situation is manipulative. What he is doing isn\u2019t normal behavior.
