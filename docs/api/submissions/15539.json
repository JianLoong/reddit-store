Your wife should have supported you on the dance floor and in leaving. That woman assaulted you.", "NTA you're entitled to not be harassed. Had you done that to a lady, you'd prolly have been beaten on and arrested for real. You have the right to say no or stop whenever you want. I'm a guy and have told ladies they are crossing my lines. Its not wrong at all. Hope your wife gets over it if she's upset, this shouldn't be blamed on you, you were victimized", "That's... assault.\n\nNTA", "NTA that\u2019s practically assault! And also just really weird.", "Fucking huh? NTA. Again, fucking huh?", "NTA.\n\nWHAT. Shirt-ripping at weddings is not a thing!!!", "NTA. This is creepy as hell. My sympathies OP. Why your wife would subject you to this when you were clearly uncomfortable is beyond me. This is harassment and needs to be called out. Time to have a serious talk with your wife about boundaries.... and \"friends\".", "NTA at all. The person in question needs to learn boundaries.", "INFO: Is there a reason you didn't tell her at any point that you were uncomfortable with what she was doing, and that you didn't want it done to you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, but I am confused as to why you never said \"please stop\" or did anything other than see her coming and get mad.", "NTA. What? Someone thought it was perfectly fine and acceptable to rip your shirt and strip you?", "NTA! \u2026just what? My skin is crawling in sympathy.", "NTA - You know this can be considered assault, right?", "NTA\n\nThat was straight up sexual harassment. You are NTA in any way.", "NTA. You were being sexually harassed and it escalated despite your very obvious body language and nonverbal communication to a point it never should have reached.\n\nYour wife\u2019s friend is a major asshole\u2014idgaf if she\u2019s incredibly gorgeous\u2014there is NO excuse for sexual harassment at any time, especially when someone so clearly tries to set a boundary.\n\nThat the harassment escalated to her destroying your clothing is sloppy and despicable on her part.\n\nAny drama is the fault of her actions\u2014not yours. You handled yourself with exceptional dignity, and you\u2019d have been well within your rights to *not* be dignified but to be angry instead and to have made a small scene.\n\nIf there\u2019s friend group drama amongst your wife\u2019s friends\u2014I\u2019m truly sorry that you and your wife are caught in the fallout. These people sound like they have poor judgement about what is and isn\u2019t appropriate in terms of healthy social boundaries.\n\nThey need to do some serious growing up. You bear no fault here for their rudeness, lack of understanding of consent, and their immaturity.", "NTA. That kind of behavior without consent (and you obviously avoided consent) is unacceptable regardless of which gender is in which role.", "NTA. This woman sounds like she needs help.", "NTA in the least. What in the hell?\n\nReminds me of a wedding my then-boyfriend, later fiance and husband, attended. The groom was his friend. We'd only met the bride that weekend.\n\nAt one point she walked in during rehearsal, pointed at my BF and said, \"I want your shirt.\" It was a button up and she wanted one, because she'd forgotten one for when she had her hair done.\n\nLuckily BF has a nice, shiny spine: looked at her unimpressed and simply said, \"No.\"\n\nThe look on his face was enough for her to look elsewhere.", "NTA!!!!! That's assault,  and everyone's lucky you didn't have PTSD around being forcibly stripped. (After which,  you might have snapped for real) THAT WOMAN is who caused drama.", "You were assaulted! If walking out after that caused drama, that group needed drama.  She should consider herself lucky you didn't call the police.  *That* would have caused drama for real.", "You are right to leave.  Your wife should be 100% supportive.  Good point, if roles were reversed  - there would be no question.  \n\nYou are NTA.  Anyone who supports this definitely is!", "NTA. You are right about if the genders were in reverse it never would have been acceptable. It\u2019s a gross double standard. If I was your wife I would have ripped into that woman in front of everyone! Sorry you had to go through that! Everyone is right about it being assault. You don\u2019t get to put your hands on whoever you want as a woman.", "Put this woman on full blast OP!  What she did is completely unacceptable.  If the roles were reversed, you\u2019d easily have been arrested.\n\nI hate to admit it, but you also have a wife problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA and it sounds like your wife is catching a bit of hell because her husband has morals and feelings and not every man (or woman) wants to be mauled by a stranger no matter how hot they are. This chick purposely targeted you, I would have given up the 1st but at least the 2nd time you walked away. She counted on her looks to get to make a scene. Your wife can tell them that sorry you just don't feel comfortable with another woman pawing on you and next time X needs to take a hint.", "NTA", "NTA. If a guy did this, he would\u2019ve been reported multiple times for sexual assault. They think it\u2019s ok because she\u2019s an attractive woman.", "NTA - seriously tired of the double-standard that it's okay for women to get away with this stuff but men would be hauled off by the po po's and called out all over social media.  Just better off planning an exit strategy if you run into her again because you're going to be called out saying anything unfortunately.", "You were SA'ed.  And like you said, if a man did that to a woman, what would have happened?  And the friend group is upset that you walked out?  What a shitty friend group.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But why did you just wait for this to happen?  Your wife should have told this friend you weren't comfortable with it when it looked like it was going to happen.  Part of me feels like it was her way of maybe trying to include and accept you into the group, but I can totally understand your level of discomfort.  You are def not the asshole.", "NTA. But also did you just say that your wife\u2019s friend who was getting married wore a black dress to her own wedding?", "This going to be an unpopular opinion, but\n\nThe time to stalk off was when she started un-tying your tie. You knew where she was going, but when she started on you, you didn't take action until after she got done. \n\nIn your story, you did read the room correctly in that this was *that* kind of party. You never said stop, instead you looked at your wife, expecting her to read you mind.\n\nNTA for doing what you did, but your expecting others (this woman, your wife) to understand you without you using words, was the wrong way to go about things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She got off way too easy.", "NTA. When you rip off someone's clothes non-consensually, it's sexual assault. You left a wedding after you were sexually assaulted.", "NTA- there are many times a woman has to stand up for her man, and against other women is the most frequent. Set guidelines between the two of you, so when another woman pulls something, together you'll have a plan. Men shouldn't step in unless the women are unable to handle it. In that case, walking, or even running, is your best bet. A woman who has the nerve to pull off other people's clothing, cannot be trusted with even a toothbrush. Also, make no mistake, that was sexual assault.", "NTA, your wife should be more considerate of your feelings of discomfort, than her friend's desire to sexually harrass you.

The standard is you don't do did like that without a clear yes.", "Imagine asking this of a woman who was assaulted on the dance floor.  \n\n\nWhy didn't you say stop?", "Right? Maybe it\u2019s some weird college tradition and they\u2019re reliving it for the wedding. People have traditions - but even assuming the best of intentions, it\u2019s NOT okay to add someone who is unwilling into the tradition- you have to ask for consent, and OP\u2019s body language clearly said \u201cconsent NOT given\u201d. So inappropriate and even more so at a wedding.", "You're absolutely right, and your take is valid, but you're doing it and yourself a disservice with the role reversal line of thought.\n\nThis woman's actions are easily bad enough to stand on their own in terms of being wrong.

But the other woman? Absent a clear, enthusiastic consent, she's out of line.", "He didn't even use his words. The whole thing is weird. He went from just avoiding her to wanting to \"call her a host of names\". He could have just said \"please don't, I'm not comfortable with this.\" He's still not the asshole though.", "That definitely adds some good context. I would maybe put that in an edit on the post, since I've seen it in a couple other comments also. Thanks for the info. That being the case, big fat NOT the asshole. I get socially awkward sometimes and I'm not even on the spectrum.
