This chick purposely targeted you, I would have given up the 1st but at least the 2nd time you walked away. She counted on her looks to get to make a scene.

But also did you just say that your wife\u2019s friend who was getting married wore a black dress to her own wedding?", "This going to be an unpopular opinion, but\n\nThe time to stalk off was when she started un-tying your tie. You knew where she was going, but when she started on you, you didn't take action until after she got done. \n\nIn your story, you did read the room correctly in that this was *that* kind of party. You never said stop, instead you looked at your wife, expecting her to read you mind.\n\nNTA for doing what you did, but your expecting others (this woman, your wife) to understand you without you using words, was the wrong way to go about things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And its still sexual assault the other way too!", "If this is what they do now not having seen each other regularly since college so many tears ago the wtf did they do back then??", "NTA and I don't agree with other commitments saying you should have said something. It's not fair to put you in a position where you have to be the one to 'kill the vibe' (I'm saying this from the perspective of drunk people who were enjoying it) when you so clearly were not into it by, walking away every time she came up to you, re doing your tie etc., anyone with half a brain can tell that you didn't want to participate.

And honestly that\u2019s weird that no one there said anything to her and instead let her do that to multiple people. It is not ok. \n\nHowever, you should be able to inform you wife that a situation is making you uncomfortable. I see you said you are on the spectrum and I wouldn\u2019t expect you to confront people you barely know.

It sounds weird as hell.", "So, you're asking us if you're the asshole because you called it quits on a reception due to being sexually harassed by a woman who is used to getting the pretty pass while your wife just stood there and watched, because you leaving caused a bunch of entitled women, who are old enough to know better, to lose their marbles in a group chat? Does that about sum it up?\n\nThe judgement will shock and amaze. NTA.\n\nYou are 100% entitled to your boundaries, and frankly you should have shoved her away, but I'm not blaming you since that sort of experience is shocking for the victim and you were caught out in the lurch at a bad time.

Not everyone would be offended by this woman's actions but plenty of people would be offended. My husband would hate every minute of it for sure. Your wife knows what type of man you are.

What is the underlying problem? Does she think you were wrong to be offended or is she too weak to stand up to her friends? Both are problematic but would require different solutions. This is an important fight in your marriage. If it is because she is weak, I encourage you to resolve it with empathy. If it is because she is too weak then she will need to work on learning to stand up for herself and you.

You didn\u2019t say yes to the undress and that makes this a sexual assault. \n\nWhile being harassed, you made a decision not to throw a scene, or cause a fight, but just to leave.

Hopefully next time someone will tell her to quit this abusive behavior. \n\n.", "NTA. \n\nThe fact that you have to defend yourself as to why you didn't speak up is just sickening.

Okay, so, if I saw my husband was giving me clues, of course I would try to protect him in the best way I know how.\n However, there is the slightest chance that she wasn't actually expecting the friend to do this to him. For me, if I completely trust someone around my husband, I wouldn't expect them to do something like that to him, especially if they knew he was on the Spectrum. If it did happen, it's very possible that I would freeze. Like remain frozen in place for at least a moment. My reaction time is horrible in certain situations.\n\nOn the other hand, though, the minute that I could get out of the freeze reaction, somebody would be in some serious do-do for lack of a better term.

I didn't want to say it but the whole role reversal thing is the only reason why I said this. This is also coming from the person whose been made uncomfortable/sexually harassed by both sexes too so it's not any less violating from either one either.

This is something people don't understand because men usually do not even register it as a sexual assault or sexual harrasment. There are so many cases when a man comes forward and is ridiculed and insulted and told to be a man.

I'm tired of people telling the victim \"you should have said something\". NO. The assaulter should have fucking not assaulted the victim. This is on them, not the victim. OP you're NTA. You did not do anything wrong. You have the absolute right to leave the situation which made you uncomfortable", "NTA by a long shot for me.

It shouldn't be relevant context to OP's reaction here. \n\nLots of people, regardless of any potential diagnosis, lock up and get quiet and shrink when somebody keeps trying to put their hands on them. Nowadays we've expanded the response to a perceived threat from that irrational place from \"Fight or Flight\" to **\"Fight, Flight, or Freeze.\"** Because a lot of people do freeze up when they're feeling provoked or threatened and when other people see that they should intervene if they have the power to do so.\n\nYes, we as adults need to practice our self-preservation and asserting a line in the sand. But that's a lot easier said than done. **We as adults also need to understand that we can't be physically touching one another without getting proper permission/consent to do so regardless.** It's **easy** for us to have an idea of the best way to respond to having a boundary crossed in our minds, a**nd when it actually happens it basically flies out the window because your mind is working much differently in that moment** when responding to something stressful and unfamiliar. \n\nI'm not trying to be harsh with you, I just wanted to be clear with why I don't think this needs to be considered relevant information for his series of reactions to this. Because ultimately, she did not get permission and the onus doesn't lie on him, diagnosis or otherwise, to have responded in a level-headed and clear manner to her actions.\n\nIt also comes dangerously close to the line of thinking that a lot of victims have had weaponized against them with the whole *\"Why didn't you say no? Why didn't you tell them to stop? Why didn't you defend yourself?\"* That's never what matters. Because ultimately, the person at fault is the one who didn't get express permission/consent to put their hands on another.", "Borderline?

Not sure why it didn't occur to me when I was writing that previous comment but it's important for us to keep this expanded definition in mind when it comes to understanding how humans respond to perceived threats, provocations, and stressful situations. \n\nThis is particularly important as we keep informing and learning as a general society about proper consent because with previous definitions it was much harder to argue that a fawn response to somebody seeking consent would not be derived as \"proper\" consent despite that \"perceived consent.\" As it is not being motivated by a genuine or enthusiastic reciprocation but rather out of an internal mechanism of self-preservation that developed from a particular set of individual and environmental circumstances.", "Agreed. From the way OP describes his behavior in this situation the non-verbal communication itself was already very clear that he didn't want to be a part of what was going on with the strange shirt-ripping stripping. \n\nSomebody who keeps walking away and trying to redress themselves and keeping a distance from you is already making it quite clear that they don't want to be a part of this."]}
