You knew where she was going, but when she started on you, you didn't take action until after she got done. \n\nIn your story, you did read the room correctly in that this was *that* kind of party.

It's not fair to put you in a position where you have to be the one to 'kill the vibe' (I'm saying this from the perspective of drunk people who were enjoying it) when you so clearly were not into it by, walking away every time she came up to you, re doing your tie etc., anyone with half a brain can tell that you didn't want to participate.

Does that about sum it up?\n\nThe judgement will shock and amaze. NTA.\n\nYou are 100% entitled to your boundaries, and frankly you should have shoved her away, but I'm not blaming you since that sort of experience is shocking for the victim and you were caught out in the lurch at a bad time.

What is the underlying problem? Does she think you were wrong to be offended or is she too weak to stand up to her friends? Both are problematic but would require different solutions. This is an important fight in your marriage. If it is because she is weak, I encourage you to resolve it with empathy. If it is because she is too weak then she will need to work on learning to stand up for herself and you.

You didn\u2019t say yes to the undress and that makes this a sexual assault. \n\nWhile being harassed, you made a decision not to throw a scene, or cause a fight, but just to leave.

However, I saw a lot of people complaining about why the wife didn't react even when he was giving her clues. Okay, so, if I saw my husband was giving me clues, of course I would try to protect him in the best way I know how.\n However, there is the slightest chance that she wasn't actually expecting the friend to do this to him. For me, if I completely trust someone around my husband, I wouldn't expect them to do something like that to him, especially if they knew he was on the Spectrum. If it did happen, it's very possible that I would freeze. Like remain frozen in place for at least a moment. My reaction time is horrible in certain situations.\n\nOn the other hand, though, the minute that I could get out of the freeze reaction, somebody would be in some serious do-do for lack of a better term. But it all really depends on how fast my husband would react as compared to how quick I react. So, I guess my possible defense for the wife would be, what is her reaction time like?
