Couldn't tell if he was trying to sell him something or get him to sign a petition or what. \n\nI waited for a minute, then said \"excuse me\". No response, so I said it louder. \"EXCUSE ME.\" They both look up at me, startled to learn they weren't alone on this city sidewalk... They move aside, and I walk past. \n\nAnd then the guy with the clipboard says \"you didn't have to be RUDE about it\".  In disbelief, I looked back and said \"and you don't think that blocking the entire sidewalk was rude?\" Guy looked \\*shocked\\* by that concept...", "NTA.

The fact he didn\u2019t makes him TA \u2014and an aggressive one at that!!!", "NTA. But you are a hero :D", "NTA someone had to say it. now his kid will learn that you should not behave like an asshole, or people will get angry, which is a good life lesson.

Maybe a louder \"excuse me, can I get by!?\" would've been a better second try.\n\nOf course he was an asshole for blocking you in the first place and for how he reacted, so both of you are at fault here.", "Oh my God this happened to me just a few weeks ago, if the carts are in the isle I just push them much further down and keep going. This woman parked in the center of the isle, grocery store, and I said \"excuse me\", she putzed around and I finally turned around and left, her and I are about the only ones in the store, loe and behold I encounter her doing the same damn thing on the next isle, she has a cart piled full of sparking water. This time I just push the cart and she goes running after it yelling \"you are supposed to ask me to move the cart\". I make a big display of looking up and down an empty isle and she is still yelling. I put my fingers in the sign of the cross and loudly said \"evil get thee away, Lord protect me from this evil\". Oh damn did she go ballistic then but it was oh so worth it! She did wish me the day I deserved to which I said a silent prayer of thanks for being able to ruin her shopping trip.", "ESH. You def did not need to jump to jackass", "ESH.  He was being a AH for blocking the aisle, you were an AH for calling him a jackass.", "ESH.\n\nI don't think the whole jackass thing was necessary, especially in front of a child. Not justifying HIS behavior throughout the whole interaction though. Nobody was in the right.", "Guessing this will be an unpopular opinion but ESH, if not YTA. He shouldn't have ignored you, but calling him a jackass in front of his toddler was a huge overreaction, especially considering it was a toddler and he was just blocking your shopping cart.

I had something similar happen at Universal Studios a few yrs ago. I was in the Harry Potter section. I went into Weasley\u2019s Wizarding Wheezes to look around. That shop is tight to navigate. I went down one side and had a couple behind me, no big deal. Well I stopped to look at something and the end of the aisle another couple comes down essentially boxing me in.
