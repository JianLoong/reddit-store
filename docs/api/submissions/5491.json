That\u2019s extremely weird and creepy behavior.", "NTA he saw you coming and blocked your path. You were polite and waited for him to move. He didn't move. I find your response to be funny. Maybe he will move next time someone says excuse me", "NTA  he had no intentions of moving you asked politely he didn\u2019t move. A shopping cart doesn\u2019t not take up the whole aisle unless you are 1. A asshole and don\u2019t care about others or 2. You are so blissfully unaware of your surroundings. I honestly put people who take up the whole aisle in the same category as those who don\u2019t take their cart back it\u2019s rude and unnecessary.", "NTA.    WTF is wrong with people that stop their carts in the middle of the aisle instead of leaving room to pass?", "Nta. Doesn't matter if he has a toddler if anything he should be setting a good example for said toddler. (I say this as a parent of a toddler)", "idk who is ta, maybe you, maybe him, probably both. but man, i\u2019ve fantasized about doing this every time i\u2019m in the grocery store, so either way, congrats", "NTA. I absolutely despise people who block exits for their own personal shit. One excuse me should have sufficed. Then it\u2019s jacksss territory or worse.", "I give you 3 chances\n1) excuse me\n2) yo\n3) move mf", "Reminds me of the time I was headed back to my office after lunch. Due to work on a nearby building, the sidewalk was enclosed on both sides and the top, so it was narrower than usual and walled-in.  \n\nSome dude was standing \\*in the middle of the walk\\* holding a clipboard with some papers and talking to some other guy. Couldn't tell if he was trying to sell him something or get him to sign a petition or what. \n\nI waited for a minute, then said \"excuse me\". No response, so I said it louder. \"EXCUSE ME.\" They both look up at me, startled to learn they weren't alone on this city sidewalk... They move aside, and I walk past. \n\nAnd then the guy with the clipboard says \"you didn't have to be RUDE about it\".  In disbelief, I looked back and said \"and you don't think that blocking the entire sidewalk was rude?\" Guy looked \\*shocked\\* by that concept...", "NTA. Everyone saying ESH because of the name calling, he called her a bitch too (Yes, after, but clearly the child presence isn\u2019t a problem if he is going to retaliate). Also I don\u2019t know what kind of stores y\u2019all are shopping at but there\u2019s easily enough room for 2 or sometimes even 3 carts to fit within the space of 1 isle at every store I\u2019ve ever been to. There is no reason he should position his cart in a way that nobody can get past him.", "There\u2019s studies on how men expect women to move for them, but to go as far as blocking you in?!

He looked at you and chose to be a jackass, you just called him out on it.\n\nNow maybe his kid will have a new nickname for him.", "NTA\n\nSometimes you have no alternative but to call an A-hole an A-hole.", "NTA THIS GUY WAS BEHAVING BEYOND CREEPILY\n\nIf you were TA, he\u2019d have moved after you called him a jackass. The fact he didn\u2019t makes him TA \u2014and an aggressive one at that!!!", "NTA. But you are a hero :D", "NTA someone had to say it. now his kid will learn that you should not behave like an asshole, or people will get angry, which is a good life lesson. My parents sound exactly like this guy. i wish someone had called them out so i could have learned to not be inconsiderate earlier on in life.", "NTA\n\nAlso, that kid is going to be repeating that for a while. So karma will live on.", "personally, I do the slow roll approach, and keep my eyes on my shopping cart, when they realize I'm not going to stop, they move..or they get run into, I have ZERO tolerance for stupidity such as this.\n\nNTA.", "INFO: how much time are we talking about here?", "NTA\nIf saying jackass in front of his kid was a problem he wouldn\u2019t have called you a bitch after. I grew up with parents who didn\u2019t curse at all and had zero chill about telling people off in public. This guy did the opposite of that.", "NTA", "ESH the whole jackass calling was totally uncalled for especially given when a child is there that\u2019s terrible cause they\u2019re going to repeat it. also for him not to move out of the way for you that\u2019s strange but you calling him a jackass doesn\u2019t help.", "ESH\n\nYou didn't have to escalate it that much and that fast.  Maybe a louder \"excuse me, can I get by!?\" would've been a better second try.\n\nOf course he was an asshole for blocking you in the first place and for how he reacted, so both of you are at fault here.", "Oh my God this happened to me just a few weeks ago, if the carts are in the isle I just push them much further down and keep going. This woman parked in the center of the isle, grocery store, and I said \"excuse me\", she putzed around and I finally turned around and left, her and I are about the only ones in the store, loe and behold I encounter her doing the same damn thing on the next isle, she has a cart piled full of sparking water. This time I just push the cart and she goes running after it yelling \"you are supposed to ask me to move the cart\". I make a big display of looking up and down an empty isle and she is still yelling. I put my fingers in the sign of the cross and loudly said \"evil get thee away, Lord protect me from this evil\". Oh damn did she go ballistic then but it was oh so worth it! She did wish me the day I deserved to which I said a silent prayer of thanks for being able to ruin her shopping trip.", "ESH. You def did not need to jump to jackass", "ESH.  He was being a AH for blocking the aisle, you were an AH for calling him a jackass.", "ESH.\n\nI don't think the whole jackass thing was necessary, especially in front of a child. Not justifying HIS behavior throughout the whole interaction though. Nobody was in the right.", "Guessing this will be an unpopular opinion but ESH, if not YTA. He shouldn't have ignored you, but calling him a jackass in front of his toddler was a huge overreaction, especially considering it was a toddler and he was just blocking your shopping cart. He shouldn't have called you a bitch either obviously, but saying you 'tried' to be polite just isn't right... going from \"Excuse me\" to \"Hey Jackass\" is way too much.", "ESH\n\nBoth of you are adults?
