Happiest place on earth my ass.

Now I had to make twice as many trips to the pharmacy. Given my long hours at work and all of the other overwhelming responsibilities in my life, I have run out more than once because I can't get to the pharmacy in a timely fashion.\n\nMore recently, my doctor's office went to digital prescriptions. She can send them directly to the pharmacy. Awesome! Automation is often an ADHD sufferer's friend. Except that it's one month at a time. And I have to send a message to my doctor once a month to get her to send the prescription to the pharmacy. Meaning I have to log in to MyChart, find the place to send my doctor a direct message since it's not on the list of prescriptions for me to renew, type a note and request it directly. I often forget to do this until I'm on my last day. Sometimes the doctor is able to send the prescription that day but the pharmacy doesn't fill it for a day or two or three due to short staffing or supply. Fortunately, my medication has not been affected by the current Adderall shortages.\n\nThen add in the insurance companies requirement for a prior authorization from the doctor once a year. So while I'm waiting on a much needed prescription, the insurance company denies it, sends paperwork to the pharmacy who then has to make the request to the doctor which takes a few days to take care of, then accepts the prescription that my doctor obviously already approved given that she wrote the prescription. It's so bloody annoying all of the hoops we have to jump through to get something that we need just to be functional in life.
