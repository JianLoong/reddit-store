While I hate people who block aisles like this (I was dealing with the same issue yesterday) I think you sounded too quick to jump to being aggressive and calling him names.

Of course this is only if they don't move when they see me coming.", "I 100% agree with this but I'm adding an additional complaint. Stores need to stop making their aisles so damned narrow! I was in Target the other day and 2 carts can barely pass each other even when you're as close to the shelving as possible. It's ridiculous!
