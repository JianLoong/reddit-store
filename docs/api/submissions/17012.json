This year that just so happens to be Mother's Day, which is generally a day I want my wife to enjoy and celebrate.\n\nThis year, I kind of expected that my birthday would take priority. My wife (38f, Jen) however has different plans. Last week Jen abruptly told me that she had booked a spa day for her and her other mommy friend about a month ago. She planned to leave me with the kids all day as she went to the spa and then got drunk on wine in the afternoon.\n\nMost years, I would be fine with this. But this year I already had other plans. I wanted to take Jen and our two children to a restaurant in the afternoon, followed by going to play some mini golf. I asked Jen if she would delay her spa trip for a couple of weeks. Nope, she didn't want to. She insisted I delay my plans instead. The issue is I'm going out of town for a work-related trip all next week and my birthday celebrations would be delayed for two weeks that way.\n\nJen showed zero interest in negotiating at all. She said she would be taking her spa day and that's that. Two nights ago I decided to call the spa and ask about the reservation in her name. They confirmed they had it. I then asked them to cancel it. The woman on the phone asked me if I was sure, and I said yes. Then last night I told Jen we'd be spending my birthday together as a family and that I had canceled her spa reservations.\n\nJen was furious. She tried to get the reservation back, but Sunday being Mother's Day, they were fully booked. Now she says we're doing nothing on Sunday but honestly her being so unreasonable was the only reason I took such measures.\n\nWas I an asshole here? Is it that wrong to want to spend my birthday with my family?", "created_utc": 1683857266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f7gug/aita_for_canceling_my_wifes_spa_day_reservation/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You guys could have easily compromised and did something special that night together. Who knows what she would\u2019ve been in the mood to do after a day of wine and relaxing.

I can understand being upset at being rudely dismissed, but it absolutely does not excuse your awful behavior.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to spend Mother's Day in a spa with a friend, sans kids and husband.

This year that just so happens to be Mother's Day, which is generally a day I want my wife to enjoy and celebrate.\n\nThis year, I kind of expected that my birthday would take priority. My wife (38f, Jen) however has different plans. Last week Jen abruptly told me that she had booked a spa day for her and her other mommy friend about a month ago. She plans to leave me with the kids all day as she goes to the spa and then gets drunk on wine in the afternoon.\n\nMost years, I would be fine with this. But this year I already had other plans. I wanted to take Jen and our two children to a restaurant in the afternoon, followed by going to play some mini golf. I asked Jen if she would delay her spa trip for a couple of weeks. Nope, she doesn't want to. She insists I delay my plans instead. The issue is I'm going out of town for a work-related trip all next week and my birthday celebrations would be delayed for two weeks that way.\n\nJen showed zero interest in negotiating at all. She said she would be taking her spa day and that's that. Two nights ago I decided to call the spa and ask about the reservation in her name. They confirmed they had it. I then asked them to cancel it. The woman on the phone asked me if I was sure, and I said yes. Then last night I told Jen we'd be spending my birthday together as a family and that I had canceled her spa reservations.\n\nJen was furious. She tried to get the reservation back, but Sunday being Mother's Day, they were fully booked. Now she says we're doing nothing on Sunday but honestly her being so unreasonable was the only reason I took such measures.\n\nWas I an asshole here? Is it that wrong to want to spend my birthday with my family?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "It isn\u2019t wrong to want to spend your birthday with your family.

I would have just gone out with my kids and celebrated my birthday without her.\n\nBut knowing my wife, if my birthday fell on Mother\u2019s Day, she would insist on spending it with me and my kids as a family because we both firmly believe family is way more important than friends.\n\nI would do the EXACT same for her if her birthday fell on father day.\n\nWe firmly prioritize family over friends.

He gets to give me a day off, and his birthday would be celebrated on a different day.\n\nIf you wouldn't give up your day, you could've given her one part of the day, and you kept another part.

And because y'all can't communicate or want each other to be happy for a single second, you'll argue about this for the next 25 May 14th's. \n\nStart actually liking each other enough to realize that happiness loves company just as much as misery and get some help for you two.

OP it\u2019s honestly just out of line. I understand wanting to be with your family on your birthday, but it doesn\u2019t always work out that way.", "My mother's birthday sometimes fell on Easter, but did she kick up a fuss? No, we sometimes had birthday cake at the end of our Easter meal (which she insisted on preparing with a little help from us kids), then she opened her presents! She was still up the night before making our Easter baskets!", "Every mother's day we had when my mother was alive, we made her breakfast, then sent her off for the day to do whatever she wanted. Like... we literally bought her a spa package one year... \n\nThese comments where they are basically saying mothers are obligated to go to these events and essentially take care of their family like every other day of the year (because let's be honest, fathers rarely step up at these events when the mother is present), are indeed baffling.", "It\u2019s a day to honor and celebrate your mother.  Kinda hard to do if she fucks off without you.", "Why can\u2019t a mother want mother days off? It\u2019s nearly impossible for moms to all get the same day/time free so Mother\u2019s Day is perfect for girls brunch and spa. Almost every mom I talk to wants a clean house and day off for Mother\u2019s Day but we aren\u2019t allowed to ask for that because of the judgment of being \u201cbad moms\u201d.", "This family doesn't seem like the \"give spa days\" sort.\n\nMore the \"cancel spa days\" sort.", "Ignore him. He hates women.", "My dad\u2019s birthday sometimes fell on thanksgiving and he loved it when that happened. He thought it was the greatest thing ever to get a huge spread like that on his birthday.", "Exactly! It's called being an Adult. You don't get privileges that children get anymore. You aren't going to always get your way in life.", "Shouldn't the person being celebrated, celebrate how they want?", "And if you, as a mother, want to spend your Mother\u2019s Day with your kids, celebrating as a family, more power to you. \nThe mother in OP\u2019s story doesn\u2019t want that as her Mother\u2019s Day present and surely a day honoring a mother should actually honor what the mother wants? Right? It shouldn\u2019t be all about what everyone other than the mother wants?", "Are you implying she would have been gone the entire 24 hours?\n\nAnd it's not like the plan was to *honor and celebrate their mother*, it was to have a birthday dinner.", "That\u2019s you and your partner problem.  Me and mine work to make sure we get needed personal time.", "Right?", "You can always do what you want, we changed the meaning of pretty much every other holiday.", "It should be about the kids celebrating and honoring their mother, hard to do when they fuck off on you.  Do what you want though.", "It\u2019s an ESH, not a NTA. Sounds like she would be gone a majority of the day by his all day comment.", "That\u2019s great you get your personal time, I am standing up for all the woman you are shaming your with your original comment. Why can\u2019t woman ask for Mother\u2019s Day off? Taking brunch and spa day for mothers does not make someone a bad mother", "And what part of it gave you the impression he would have allotted ANY of the day to her honoring and celebration?", "If you want to fuck off on Mother\u2019s Day, fuck off on Mother\u2019s Day.  I tend to believe that day is about honoring that bond and being with each other, not bailing on them.", "Again, it\u2019s an ESH.", "Based on your comments I am pretty sure you aren\u2019t actually married or you follow the Andrew tate beliefs. So I am going fuck off \u270c\ud83c\udffb", "That's your vote. Keep it to one vote please instead of spamming it."]}
