How we got engaged and our plans for the wedding have recently caused fights with my stepdad and I want objective opinions.\n\nBackground info: My fianc\u00e9 and I come from the same culture - I was raised overseas where as he was raised in our home country. My dad passed away when I was around 12. During this time, my maternal grandparents moved to our country to help look after me and my sister (28f). My mom had to work long hours and sell our house to keep our lifestyle - we went to a private school and had extra curricular activities. Due to this, my grandparents really stepped up as surrogate parents; and we became very close.\n\nWhen I was around 15, my mom met David, who lived a town over. My sister and I both understood it was important for our mom to be happy, as we knew how much she sacrificed for us, so we were always welcoming of David. After they got married, we all decided as a family that my sister and I would stay with my grandparents so we could still attend the same school while my mom moved in with David. \n\nThrough high school, David kept offering to pay our university tuition. My dad left my sister and I enough money to cover that comfortably, and would have wanted us to use it to pursue education. We told him what our dad's wishes were and politely declined his offer. He said we could save that money and take his instead. While generous, we wanted to respect our dad's wishes and it kind of felt like there were some strings attached to that money, if I'm being honest.\n\nAfter graduation, I was accepted into a prestigious university in my home country. It's the only time I've seen my grandfather cry. That's where I met my fianc\u00e9. This year, we had the opportunity to come back for his work and we jumped at the chance. In our culture, the groom's head of family talks to the bride's head of family (usually fathers) after the proposal. So when my fianc\u00e9 proposed, we set up a meeting between his father and my grandfather. We had a family dinner recently to talk about wedding stuff and I mentioned the meeting and how I was excited for grandfather to walk me down the aisle. That's when David lost it. He started yelling saying I already took 'asking the father's hand' away from him now this. I've never lived with David, and he's never parented me. We've always gotten along well, and I respect him as my mother's husband and father of my brother (10), but I've never seen him as a father and was shocked he'd see himself as mine. My grandfather yelled and told him he was overstepping. I offered him the father-daughter dance but he said he didn't want it with someone who clearly didn't respect him. Now my mom is mediating between me, her husband and father. I genuinely want to know, AITA?\n\nTLDR: my stepdad, who I've never lived with, was surprised my fianc\u00e9 didn't ask him for my hand and that I planned on my grandfather walking me down the aisle.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1698909224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lxx4a/aita_for_not_letting_my_stepdad_walk_me_down_the/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You naturally chose the actual father figure in your life. David is overstepping. Your mom needs to get him to back off. He needs to know his place, but his ego is blinding him. \n\nYou owe his ego nothing. He created his own issue here. He's an adult. It's up to him to find common sense. \n\nBest of luck with your marriage", "No. He's dumb for thinking he'd do it. He has one kid and it's your brother. Your mom and stepdad gave you up to live with the grandparents so they have no parental rights.", "while the choice of who walks the bride down the aisle is ALWAYS the bride\u2019s choice, in this case you\u2019ve never even lived under the same roof\u2026very clearly NTA and your mother needs to tell him straight up he\u2019s delusional!", "You are definitely NTA. \n\nYou mentioned feeling like his money came with strings attached. Whether that\u2019s nefarious or simply a guy trying to create an insta-1950s-family scenario and not getting his way, who knows. But either way, David has his own issues that have absolutely nothing to do with you. You seem like you have a great head on your shoulders and your grandfather is the father figure who deserves to be involved in your wedding because of the relationship you\u2019ve built and nurtured, not because it was demanded. \n\nCongratulations on your engagement! \ud83e\udd42 Enjoy this time and don\u2019t let this drama spoil it.", "NTA. David is a big one. He owes all of you an apology. Tell him he can't come to the wedding unless he does.", "NTA. If he was truly part of your family and played the role of a father in your life, you would not have such questions. So obviously he didn't do it.", "Your step father's hissy fit was neither appropriate nor mature. Your grandfather raised you.  Of course he was the person you and your fiance's father turned to.  You've done nothing wrong; your step-father has. \n\nYour mom can stop mediating now, there's nothing to mediate.  You will continue to make the best decisions for yourself and your fiance, not for a very nice (until now) step-father who has never, ever been in the position of parenting you despite his generous offer to pay for your education.\n\nWishing you a beautiful wedding and marriage.  On your own very reasonable terms.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIf you don't feel that he is a father figure in your life, then he has no right to fatherly duties. You said it yourself, he is your mother's husband, not your father.", "NTA.\n\nIt's hard to tell from your post whether David really has wanted to be a father figure to you or whether he just feels entitled to the patriarch role, but either way \u2013 that's not what he is to you. Your grandfather has that place, and you shouldn't have to disregard that genuine love and respect to placate your mother's husband.", "NTA, it sounds like David is not only overstepping but may have some control issues. Wanted to pay for your tuition and you said you felt that came with strings attached and now this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's risking the relationship with her daughter over a man that added no value to your life whatsoever.\nHe's HER husband, and that's where your relationship/respects ends. The entitlement is concerning", "Nta", "NTA. David is indeed overstepping the mark. This is your choice, David can go pound some cake. Have a nice wedding!", "NTA it is your Wedding and your choice. David is Not your father and you don't need to cater after him. It's a sweet gesture for everything they have done for you and your sister that you asked your grandpa.

I think you're probably right about insta-family, as he mentioned to my mom it would 'make them look like bad parents' if he wasn't involved.
