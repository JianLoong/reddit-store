I am highly functional, to the point that I do not know how to unmask and am trying to learn now. It is very easy to push me around. I am working on it but it\u2019s slow. \n\nMy husband hosts a DnD game every Saturday. I\u2019m not interested so I help get everything ready before guests arrive and after I say a quick hello, I go upstairs. Saturday nights are self-care for me \u2013 I take baths, do face masks, set up my planner, that kind of thing.\n\nMy husband\u2019s friends John has a new girlfriend, Jane (maybe 24?) I don\u2019t enjoy spending time with her. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her, she\u2019s a nice person but she has the type of personality that bulldozes over me. She interrupts me a lot, grabs my arm and tends to be very loud and it\u2019s just a lot.\n\nThis weekend, I greeted most of my husband\u2019s friends. I went upstairs before the stragglers arrived. I was starting my skincare when Jane appeared in my bathroom. Apparently, John told her that I\u2019m always \u201cdoing nothing\u201d while they play &he thought I could use some company so she came to hang out with me. I didn\u2019t want company. But I told her I wanted to finish what I was doing &then we could find something to do.\n\nI have a complicated Korean style skincare routine with multiple steps& products. She beelined for my vanity and started gushing over it, picking things up and moving them around, telling me she had seen some on TikTok and she was curious about them. I was trying to ask her not to touch but she didn\u2019t seem to hear me and kept talking over me to ask what something was like and what I thought of it. She started opening containers, sticking her fingers in them and testing them right on her face and I was so wound up at this point that I knew if I opened my mouth, all that was going to come out was \u201cstop it! Go away!\u201d and I\u2019d probably cry so I just went quiet and let her. I saw her mix actives (very bad) on her face and I didn't stop her because I didn\u2019t want to melt down in front of a near stranger. She commented that it was stinging a bit but she didn\u2019t wash it off and I didn\u2019t tell her to. Finally, I got her out of my bathroom and I suggested watching a movie so we didn\u2019t have to talk. \n\nI was still upset when she left and my husband apologized to me - he was in the middle of something when he saw her going up the stairs and didn\u2019t want to make a scene but promised he won\u2019t let that happen again unless I\u2019m prepared for it.\n\nOn Sunday morning, we received an angry phone call from them. Jane\u2019s skin reacted poorly and she was badly broken out with angry, red, sensitive skin. I said it was from using my actives & she should be diligent with sunscreen so it won\u2019t get worse. She flipped out and asked why I didn\u2019t stop her if I knew what would happen. I didn't know what to say so I let her yell until my husband hung up. I feel bad. I didn't want her to see me when I felt vulnerable but I knew it would be painful for her & I chose myself anyway and now I feel like that was wrong.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697491881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179hd0s/aita_for_not_stopping_someone_from_using_my/", "score": 457, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want company, you will arrange for it yourself. And if one of the DnD buddies does bring someone over, your husband should make them wait and tell them you already have your own plans. He can let you know who's there and see if you don't mind spending time with that person. (Of course, if it's Jane, he knows that you are not free to entertain her... and never will be!)
