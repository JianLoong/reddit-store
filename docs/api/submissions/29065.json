{"id": 29065, "submission_id": "179hd0s", "title": "AITA for not stopping someone from using my skincare?", "selftext": "I have recently been diagnosed with autism at 29yo. I am highly functional, to the point that I do not know how to unmask and am trying to learn now. It is very easy to push me around. I am working on it but it\u2019s slow. \n\nMy husband hosts a DnD game every Saturday. I\u2019m not interested so I help get everything ready before guests arrive and after I say a quick hello, I go upstairs. Saturday nights are self-care for me \u2013 I take baths, do face masks, set up my planner, that kind of thing.\n\nMy husband\u2019s friends John has a new girlfriend, Jane (maybe 24?) I don\u2019t enjoy spending time with her. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her, she\u2019s a nice person but she has the type of personality that bulldozes over me. She interrupts me a lot, grabs my arm and tends to be very loud and it\u2019s just a lot.\n\nThis weekend, I greeted most of my husband\u2019s friends. I went upstairs before the stragglers arrived. I was starting my skincare when Jane appeared in my bathroom. Apparently, John told her that I\u2019m always \u201cdoing nothing\u201d while they play &he thought I could use some company so she came to hang out with me. I didn\u2019t want company. But I told her I wanted to finish what I was doing &then we could find something to do.\n\nI have a complicated Korean style skincare routine with multiple steps& products. She beelined for my vanity and started gushing over it, picking things up and moving them around, telling me she had seen some on TikTok and she was curious about them. I was trying to ask her not to touch but she didn\u2019t seem to hear me and kept talking over me to ask what something was like and what I thought of it. She started opening containers, sticking her fingers in them and testing them right on her face and I was so wound up at this point that I knew if I opened my mouth, all that was going to come out was \u201cstop it! Go away!\u201d and I\u2019d probably cry so I just went quiet and let her. I saw her mix actives (very bad) on her face and I didn't stop her because I didn\u2019t want to melt down in front of a near stranger. She commented that it was stinging a bit but she didn\u2019t wash it off and I didn\u2019t tell her to. Finally, I got her out of my bathroom and I suggested watching a movie so we didn\u2019t have to talk. \n\nI was still upset when she left and my husband apologized to me - he was in the middle of something when he saw her going up the stairs and didn\u2019t want to make a scene but promised he won\u2019t let that happen again unless I\u2019m prepared for it.\n\nOn Sunday morning, we received an angry phone call from them. Jane\u2019s skin reacted poorly and she was badly broken out with angry, red, sensitive skin. I said it was from using my actives & she should be diligent with sunscreen so it won\u2019t get worse. She flipped out and asked why I didn\u2019t stop her if I knew what would happen. I didn't know what to say so I let her yell until my husband hung up. I feel bad. I didn't want her to see me when I felt vulnerable but I knew it would be painful for her & I chose myself anyway and now I feel like that was wrong.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697491881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179hd0s/aita_for_not_stopping_someone_from_using_my/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't just stick your fingers in other people's products...its unsanitary.  That's quite a violation. If it doesn't make it worse for you,  Id ask your husband to ban her from your house.", "Send her an email or text so you don\u2019t have to talk to her, and just tell her that you are averse to confrontation, especially with people you don\u2019t know well, and that in the moment you were unable to come up with the words needed to get her to stop touching your things without sounding confrontational. Then say you would like to issue a blanket statement that while she is welcome in your home, you do not want anyone upstairs or your things touched without having been clearly granted situational privileges. (Or whatever it is you want her to knock off.) NTA.", "NTA, it\u2019s her own fault for not asking if she could use them. At the very least she should have said \u201cCan I try this?\u201d I have known my best friend for almost 15 years and I still ask every single time if I can use something of hers, even though she has previously given permission. Some people just don\u2019t understand common courtesy.", "NTA.\n\nShe had a FAFO moment.

Not even a little bit, lady.", "NTA!  \nShe put products she wasn't familiar with on her skin without asking the owner who was right beside her.... it is absolutely her fault...", "NTA - She stuck her fingers in your stuff without asking, she deserves the results.", "NTA, she shouldn\u2019t have put unfamiliar products on her skin without reading the instructions. At the very least she should have asked you, I\u2019m sorry you had someone invade your space and then blow up on you after.", "NTA.  She wouldn't have listened to you even if you had tried to warn her, so she deserves what she gets.  And anyway, who in their right mind just sticks their fingers into someone else's jars of unknown substances and smears them on their face?  \n\nDon't feel bad about it.  She did it to herself.", "It's too bad you didn't do it on purpose because the petty revenge angle is delicious.\n\nNTA nonetheless.  You shut down, which is pretty normal in a situation where someone is bulldozing you, autistic or not.  I'm glad your husband apologized and hopefully he will make good on his promise to keep her away from you.  Better yet, it would be lovely if she didn't come on DnD night if she isn't participating in the game.", "NTA. What did she expect, she barely knows you and she started poking her literal fingers in a bunch of skincare products -- that's super unhygienic -- it's a miracle all she got was a rash. I'm amazed you were able to keep it together and I fully understand not wanting to say anything for fear of the floodgates opening up.", "NTA\n\nThis asshole had it coming.\n\nSorry this happened, I am mildly ASD and one of my worst triggers is a stranger going through my shit.", "I'd ask her to replace everything she put her fingers in.", "NTA that\u2019s what she gets for helping herself without being invited or given permission. You should ban her from your house though for her behaviour.", "NTA.  she completely invaded your space and then put stuff on her skin without even asking permission or what it was.  her skin is her responsibility, this is totally her fault.  if she had been at a store trying out samples would she blame the store for not telling her?  i can't believe she yelled at you, too.  she doesn't even know you.  i'm sorry.", "NTA. She creates this situation and you were, not surprisingly, rather speechless about how to respond. I don\u2019t have autism but I can see it happening to me\u2014being just so shocked I can\u2019t even get words out bc someone is doing something so bizarre. \n\nAlso, the consequences of her actions, while uncomfortable, aren\u2019t life threatening or permanently disfiguring, so there\u2019s no need to feel so bad. She was a dumbass for putting shit she didn\u2019t know on her face, that\u2019s it. Meh. Not that big a deal. Now make sure your h tells his friends the invitation is for them and not their partners.", "Haha, this would have been great petty revenge if you'd had planned it!\n\nNTA - who just starts dipping their fingers into other people's crap like that?  Silence is not consent (to take a phrase from a more serious situation, but it still applies to other human interactions).  She deserved that, let it be a lesson to her to respect other people and ask permission.  Toddler are taught better than this.  NTA.", "NTA she is an \"adult\" she should have asked.

OP said she had a complex system, as many people do. The dried unicorn horn has to be used \\*before\\* the ichor, and they're both pretty ineffective unless you follow up with the diamond-dust sealant. You don't just take a dab of one thing to \"see how I like it\"!", "I used to work at a beauty supply store and you would be amazed how many people I had to stop from dipping their fingers into the products and using the hairbrushes on their hair.
