It\u2019s weird that you guys exclude spouses and SOs from a coed group trip.\n\nObviously Julian\u2019s fianc\u00e9e sucks for sharing private information about you to others.", "NTA but assuming they work out, you will have to learn to tolerate her presence. I\u2019m so sorry she exposed you, though! Super shitty. Did she expose you on purpose or on accident? Did her apology seem genuine?", "Ehhh... I kinda see it as ESH.\n\nThe fiancee sucks for spilling a bombshell of a secret that was not her secret to tell. Like, who does that??? Especially since your family is not technically hers or Julian's family?\n\nEveryone else sucks for trying to force you to go on vacation with someone you don't get along with.  And you have a very valid reason to dislike her.\n\nHowever, you also kinda suck on insisting the trip still occur without her, even knowing your history with Julian.  She also has very good reasons to feel uncomfortable with him going on vacation with his ex-girlfriend that he almost had a child with.\n\nIt's just very odd to me that you expect nothing about your relationship with Julian to have changed. You are no longer just childhood friends; you are his ex that, again, he *almost had a child with*.  I don't think it's unreasonable that future partners (on both his end AND yours) would be apprehensive about being banned from a vacation that the two of you are going on together. It'd be one thing if the partner was invited but declined to come. However, to be outright BANNED...... Can you see how it might seem fishy from her POV?", "YTA.\n\n>I had sex with Julian\n\nIf I was in the place of Julian's fianc\u00e9, I wouldn't want my fianc\u00e9 going on a road trip with an Ex/previous sexual partner without me - regardless of the other factors you've mentioned.", "YTA, look I feel you but if everyone is on board with this except for you you either need to deal with it or back out of the trip. Realistically this no spouses thing was going to end some time, traditions change with time. It's not fair for everyone to bend to your rules when you could just back out.", "YTA.  It's a miracle you are still in eachothers lives.

No. Its not your trip.", "I'd tell them that she can have my spot and I'd drop out.\n\nProbably next year, everyone would veto her.\n\nESH.. except the four people who are NOT pressuring you to let her come.", "INFO: did you ever talk with the fianc\u00e9e? Trying to patch things up etc?", "YTA. \n\nMaybe ESH. \n\nNobody should be telling your family about your personal business. You also have no right to exclude somebody\u2019s life partner. Having friends of the opposite sex is fine, where I draw the line is if I am not welcome, my partner has no business there either. Group plans a movie on a night I\u2019m busy? Sure, my partner can go without me, have fun. Group plans an overnight road trip that I am not welcome to join and involves somebody my partner has had sex with? No. Hard no. That\u2019s just disrespectful.", "YTA.   If everyone else doesn't care, you vetoing it is just going to put a sour feel on the trip.  And it will be even more tense between you and Julian.   And it will look to everyone like you're just jealous and don't want to see Julian with another girl.  It's a bad look all around.", "YTA Mainly because the majority has voted. It seems like no one cares that she joins but you. Like it or not, she is Julian's fiance now which means she comes first in his life. Of course he will try to include her ! You can either hash it out with her or don't go.  Or you can make your own trip and not invite Julian. But you can't be mad at her for wanting to go on vacation with her fiance. Be realistic.", "YTA.\n\nUnspoken rules aren't rules.\nAlso, what she spilled doesn't sound world-ending to me. Private, yes. But no reason to be endlessly angry. And she apologized, maybe she didn't know it was supposed to be a secret? Honestly, it sounds like you have deeper problems with the fiance.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA - no one else is bringing partners, the fianc\u00e9 can stay home.", "While your first point could very well be true, it\u2019s not a fair assumption to make. It\u2019s possible the fianc\u00e9e simply wants to be with her fianc\u00e9. Especially if she\u2019s fond of this friend group and/or likes to travel too\u2026 with nothing more to it.\n\nOP needs to give more context to this whole sex/abortion reveal. Was the fianc\u00e9e jealous or vindictive? Was it an accident? We also need more context on the nature of her continued friendship with someone she has a relatively intense history with. You don\u2019t just shrug off intimacy, pregnancy, and abortion combined. How long ago was this?\n\nEdit to add: OP has every right to be pissed over her spilling the beans though. Intentional or accidental\u2026 I\u2019d be livid and I understand the disdain. I brought what I said up to try to stay objective in how we view the fianc\u00e9e. We can\u2019t assume she\u2019s a conniving insecure control freak.", "I'm not his ex. We had sex once when I was 19. It was a stupid mistake and nothing has or will ever happen between us again.", "Why not? My partner has stayed friends with at least two exes and a crush, and I totally trust him around them. One of his exes has even become good friends with me, I got her a job and helped with family trouble. Just because someone slept with someone in the past does not mean they have to do it again.", "It\u2019s literally one person or another. If Julian backs out bc no fianc\u00e9e then they are out. If OP backs out Oved this they aren\u2019t going. Is everyone bending to the OP\u2019s rules when the rules have always been no spouse (when julian\u2019s isn\u2019t even a spouse)? I\u2019m not disagreeing just discussing. I mean if multiple spouses were going I\u2019d agree wirh you 100%.", "Genuine question; what did Julian do exactly? At least from the post, there wasn't any indication that the sex/abortion wasn't consensual on both sides?  Like, agreed, it's definitely super weird that they carry on like none of that happened and continue to go on vacation together, and it wasn't the fiancee's place to spill the beans, but that was the fiancee's mess-up, not Julian's?", "Patch up the fact that the fianc\u00e9 shared her private info with family? Hell to the No.", "Julian can not go if he doesn't want to go without her. I'm not dropping out for her.", "The woman exposed a medical procedure that OP had every right to keep to herself. No one had the right to spill that info regardless of wether you think it sounds world-ending.\n\nNext time you get a medical procedure how about you let a rando tell your whole family not just about the procedure, but everything that led up to the procedure being necessary. \n\nEveryone deserves the respect of being able to keep their medical histories private.", "I agree.  Families utterly disown their children for choices like this.   They will never look at them the same.  Especially if they are \"christian\".", "Whether or not a medical procedure is a \u201csecret\u201d it simply was not her GD business to tell or even discuss? It literally had nothing to do with her. She made her bed with OP, she can lay in it.", ">maybe she didn't know it was supposed to be a secret?\n\nOh please, it's common sense not to divulge something private to other people. She even apologized to op herself meaning she did know that she was wrong. Don't talk like abortion is something to be talked about at a dinner table all the time. It's not. It's a private thing and certainly not something anyone other than the op should share. That fiance AND Julian are the AH.", "They sound like Americans. Could be wrong. Regardless, there is a stigma against abortion in many western countries. So she didn\u2019t lightly bring up the topic as casual brunch convo. There is always a level of maliciousness in revealing someone\u2019s abortion to their parents.", "Ah, gotcha, so more of a one-night-stand thing, then.  Still, I feel like that would only minimally change how future partners might be concerned about your relationship going forward.  You two seem like you are still very close, and historically have shown that you are (or at least were) willing to take your relationship to a physical level.  Even if you know you'll never go there again, there's no real way to prove that to his fiancee. Especially since the last time it happened, the two of you hid it. From everyone.  She 100% should NOT have taken it upon herself to reveal the truth to your family; that should have only been done by yourself or Julian. However, it's still not unreasonable of her to be wary of your relationship with her fiance.", "Agreed.

She is still one of our closest friends.", "see i'm looking at it not as OP vs Julian and more like 5 people being ok with it vs 1 who isn't. and I just think this is one of those situations where majority rule should be the decider.", "It's beyond me that he'd still be in her life and that he told his fiance knowing all the components.  Plus,  the fiance told everyone.\n\nIt sounds super toxic for all involved.  I was in the posters shoes - and while the guy was a good guy - I just couldn't have him in my life much after that.  I didn't want an abortion even though I truly felt it was the right idea.  I would have kept it if he gave me any incling he wanted it too.  \n\nBeing in that kind of dynamic will never be healthy.  I would Never be okay with my fiance being with a woman he experienced that with.\n\nThere are somethings that draw a boundary no matter how much you think you worked through.", "a) I would have no problem with anyone telling my family. We're close and on good footing. Your attack missed here.\n\nb) yes, everybody has that right. And I didn't say it was okay or anything. I said that I think it's no reason to have a huge long term grudge ending in \"I don't even want to be neat that person\".", "It's not any other people, it's her family. I would also assume that her family knows that, and OP didn't tell us HOW she spilled it. Maybe it was smth like \"so, how did you cope with that time\". We simply don't know.", "That seems logical.", "Gotcha.  Yeah, I've personally never been in that situation, so while I can definitely sympathize, I can't really empathize.  I agree it's weird that they're still both so involved in each other's lives, but it seems like that's because of a lack of boundary-setting on both their ends, not just his.  I don't find it all that strange that he told his fiancee, though. That seems (at least to me) like one of those things you 100% disclose to someone before you marry them? Like, if I find out AFTER the wedding that my husband had a physical relationship with his childhood friend, got her pregnant, she had an abortion, but then they still remained extremely close and have no intention of changing their relationship, I'd be STEAMED.  I personally would feel manipulated and lied to.  I'd be questioning what else he hid from me.", ">Your attack missed here.\n\nWhat attack?", "> I said that I think it's no reason to have a huge long term grudge ending in \"I don't even want to be neat that person\".\n\nBut don't you think the person who should decide if the mistake is a huge deal or not the person who is wronged?
