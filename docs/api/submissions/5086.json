A baby is a huge financial and emotional commitment and you have every right to know if the baby is yours before you dedicate the rest of your life to the baby.

Whilst it was a bit silly to continue having sex with someone who habitually cheats on you (risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are a consideration)... what's done is done and you're in this current situation.\n\nGood luck with the outcomes of this situation and please consider getting yourself tested for anything sexually transmitted in the meantime.

Nevertheless, you should still take care of her during pregnancy and assuming it is yours, eg help her with driving to the doctor or some necessary medical spending.

You say you are still in HS.  If you are escape this scare and are not the father of this child, you need to get super serious about birth control.  If you are the father of this child, you need to get super serious about birth control.  I know a couple of guys who fathered kids in HS.
