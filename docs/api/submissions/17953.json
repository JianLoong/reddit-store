The last few vacations we were not invited and not even aware until photos were posted on social media, we were understandably hurt, but my husband didn't want to make anyone aware. \n\nMy MIL just informed my husband that we would be the two people using the bunk beds at the vacation home.  While the 2 children will be getting their own rooms with queen beds. When we were first looking at the pictures and listing of the airbnb, I made a joke that MIL would make us use the bunk bed.

We are making all the meals for an entire day out of this trip, while my BIL and his wife will be taking a card of another day, and we are ordering out the last day. Since MIL paid for it, she will not be providing any food. \n\nI was in disbelief when my hubby told me,  and he said we would have to purchase and bring an air mattress if it would even fit, which we are unsure if it will. I feel like we are still unwelcome to this family function, and personally, I don't feel like going anymore.\n\nMy husband is upset as well but is complacent with not voicing our concerns. I'm not feeling welcome and am anxious about how the weekend will go. I know we aren't the ones paying for the cabin, and we don't always fit in with the rest of the family, but it feels disrespectful to me.\n\nWIBTA, if I didn't go or if I voiced how I'm feeling in some way?\n\nTL;DR\nMIL does not usually invite us to family vacations, invited us, and is having my hubby and I use twin bunk beds while everyone, even the children, get seperate rooms and queen beds.", "created_utc": 1684808398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pb4g5/wibta_for_making_a_big_deal_out_of_sleeping_in_a/", "score": 1046, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Queens are in the same room: BIL and SIL take the double queen room and have their bio kid sleep on the second bed, foster kid takes the bunk bed, and OP and hubby take the room BIL and SIL were originally staying in\n\n3. Kids are sharing the queen bed and the phrasing is off in the post: This one is simple. Kids take the bunk bed, OP and hubby take the queen bed\n\n4.

Op, you're only being invited to bring the food. MIL needs that food. I suggest a group message,  thanks for inviting us, but unfortunately the sleeping arrangements don't work for us, so on this occasion we'll bow out, hope you have a lovely time, can't wait to see the photos on social media!

Yes.  Not making a big deal out of it, but politely turning down the invite?

There really isn't a winning move, either you end up creating conflict, and MIL gets exactly what she wanted, OR you you submit and she wins, but there's no drama.  She still gets to flex.\n\nI do not recommend trying to pull one over on her and try and fanagel a queen room, she's planning on you doing that.

Go along with it, enjoy it, be happy and smiley.  Play it up like you're having fun a camp or something.  The only way to beat MIL is if the people around you think she is the AH on their own.\n\nAll that said, the real answer is a bit more of a bitter but simple pill.  Decline the invite, cut contact, move on with your lives.  Despite the reconciliation between your MIL and your hubby, the old wounds are still there, and your MIL will never let them heal.
