We are more than happy to chip in, and whether we attend or not, the airbnb will be used by the family. We are not upset at all for planning and paying for everyones food for an entire day, I just wish we were shown a bit more respect from MIL or more so, I'm wondering why we are being treated differently.\n\nMy (21F) husband's (21M) mother (44F) has invited us to go on vacation at a cabin that is a few hour drive. My husband and MIL have disagreed/ fought on many things and have finally decided to put the past behind them. My husband, his two brothers, SIL, his brothers foster kid, mom, cousins, and cousins SOs are invited. There will be 10 of us in total. The last few vacations we were not invited and not even aware until photos were posted on social media, we were understandably hurt, but my husband didn't want to make anyone aware. \n\nMy MIL just informed my husband that we would be the two people using the bunk beds at the vacation home.  While the 2 children will be getting their own rooms with queen beds. When we were first looking at the pictures and listing of the airbnb, I made a joke that MIL would make us use the bunk bed. Unfortunately, it is now not a joke... \n\nUs and his brother & SIL are the only married couples going on this trip. MIL is single, both cousins and SOs are newly dating, and the other brother and foster child are both 10 or younger. We are making all the meals for an entire day out of this trip, while my BIL and his wife will be taking a card of another day, and we are ordering out the last day. Since MIL paid for it, she will not be providing any food. \n\nI was in disbelief when my hubby told me,  and he said we would have to purchase and bring an air mattress if it would even fit, which we are unsure if it will. I feel like we are still unwelcome to this family function, and personally, I don't feel like going anymore.\n\nMy husband is upset as well but is complacent with not voicing our concerns. I'm not feeling welcome and am anxious about how the weekend will go. I know we aren't the ones paying for the cabin, and we don't always fit in with the rest of the family, but it feels disrespectful to me.\n\nWIBTA, if I didn't go or if I voiced how I'm feeling in some way?\n\nTL;DR\nMIL does not usually invite us to family vacations, invited us, and is having my hubby and I use twin bunk beds while everyone, even the children, get seperate rooms and queen beds.", "created_utc": 1684808398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pb4g5/wibta_for_making_a_big_deal_out_of_sleeping_in_a/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
