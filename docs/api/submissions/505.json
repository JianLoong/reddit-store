After a few minutes, my mother left. My siblings, dad and my in-laws all agreed that I did the right thing and we went on celebrating. I knew my mother's family were all gossiping and talking shit but I didn't care. We left for our honeymoon and I muted everyone on my phone except my wife.\n\nWell we got back a few days ago and I unmuted everyone and everyone's still talking about it. My mother has been calling and messaging me non-stop. All of my mother's family have been calling me names and telling me what I did was wrong. My in-laws who were originally supportive of my decision told me I should get in contact with my mother and apologise and reconcile. They know what she did was wrong but mothers are important and it was one time and she now knows I am 100% about not taking any of this shit. I told them what my wife told me, that kicking her out of our wedding showed my wife and everyone that I won't tolerate any shit of any kind and that I did it for my wife, my in-laws, and our future children. \n\nThis has all caused a big rift in my family and I don't want to be on bad terms with my in-laws, I love them very much and I'm now thinking maybe they have a point and I should reconcile with my mother. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667075208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygttfs/aita_for_staying_true_to_my_word_and_kicking_my/", "score": 973, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did the right thing to kick her out.", "NTA Honestly, I'm horrified on behalf of your wife that her MIL had the audacity to make such an offensive and cruel speech. For your wife's sake, it's time to go no contact with your mother, and low contact with anyone who dares to defend her unforgivable actions.\n\nDon't fall for that whole toxic \"but faaaamily\" mentality. This was not a one time thing, this was her intentionally being cruel to your wife after she had been given her first warning. Explain to your in-laws how your mother has made it clear (repeatedly) how she feels about your wife and how you can't repair a relationship with someone who will continue to treat your wife so poorly. If you allow your mother back into your life you will be enabling her, her behavior will only escalate once she realizes she's going to continue to get away with it.\n\nAs for the rest of your family, just block anyone who continues to harass you on your mother's behalf. Don't entertain any of the flying monkeys, and don't reconsider your stance on your mother for a long time. \n\nIf your mother actually starts to make changes and down the road you think she might be ready for another chance, you can always consider it then. But right now you KNOW that nothing has changed.", "NTA. Good for you for following through. There is NO place for racism in this world and certainly not within a family. Your mother should feel so ashamed of her behavior. In moving forward I don't think you should necessarily apologize to her but maybe give her an opportunity to apologize to you and to your wife but only if your wife wants this. It has to be her choice where to go from here.", "NTA - So sorry you and your bride had to deal with this toxic crap at your wedding, but major applause for bringing the hammer down hard and fast.  You certainly should consult with your wife, and I suggest a sitdown with the in-laws to make sure you have a good understanding of the cultural nuances that make them willing to advocate for your mother this way.  No way at all any apology is due to your mother, but if it really is important to your wife and her family, a single chance at reconciliation, that starts with an abject, sincere apology from your mother to you and your wife, might be worthwhile.  However, in your shoes, I would make sure the inlaws understand that it would be a one and done deal--the next time she makes a single snide, racist or demeaning remark, nuclear option goes into place and she (and anyone in your family who support her in this) are NC and totally done. \n\nGood luck--may you and your your wife enjoy a long and happy life together!", "Info: How does your wife want to go forward?", "What does your wife think you should do?\n\nIn all honesty, for the sake of your marriage, their direction is probably the most important one to take here.", "NTA - your life, your choice.

She knew damn well what she was going to do, that is why she wanted to go last.", "NTA you stood up for your wife, as you should", "NTA\n\nSo here's the thing: the only\"reconciliation\" that can really happen here is your mother making a sincere and unqualified apology, and you accepting it. That's pretty much it. You have NOTHING to apologize for, and you SHOULD NOT apologize for defending your wife and her family. You mom's racism doesn't deserve a pass just because she's your mom. Even if your wife/in-laws want you to reconcile for the sake of family harmony, only YOU can decide what reconciliation looks like and what is acceptable to you. \"Family harmony\" is an illusion if nothing changes, except your mom gets to keep doing what she wants WTF no consequences, and you have to keep \"forgiving/accepting\" just because she's your mom. That's not a real relationship.\n\nI've been estranged from my father for 13 months, based on unacceptable (abusive, immoral and illegal) behavior that happened in the past that I finally confronted him about. I expressed at the time that I was only interested in attempting a relationship if he was willing to apologize and take responsibility for his actions. He cursed me out and refused, and did the same thing about 10 months later when I attempted to communicate. Am I sad? Yeah. Is it hard not having a relationship with a parent? Yeah. Is it still the right choice? For me, absolutely.\n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA. A lot of people are uncomfortable watching a relative/friend cut off family because if you can do it to others, you can do it to **them**. They know that if they cross the line, you will not hesitate to cut them off to. They don't like that.", "NTA!  Woah your mama was out of line with the things she said!  I'd say really, it's up to you with what you want to do going forward about your mama but also maybe ask your wife her thoughts.  Y'all are a couple, her input is important especially since it did involve her.  But no, you absolutely are not the AH for making her leave for saying those things at your wedding, good grief!!!!  Also congrats on your wedding, best wishes for you and your lovely bride!!", "Relatives \u2260 family, not even if the relative is a mother or father. Your mother was 100% wrong in what she did and you had every right to toss her out of the wedding reception. You do not owe her an apology. She absolutely owes you one. NTA", "NTA. What your mom said was really fucked up. And it was to your bride. On her wedding day. Publicly.\n\nI don\u2019t think I could ever forgive that, personally. What other people think doesn\u2019t matter. You have a boundary and it was clearly demarcated *before* she crossed it.\n\n\u201cGold standard\u201d racism is still racism. Even if you\u2019re \u201ccomplimenting\u201d someone for not meeting racist stereotypes\u2026 that\u2019s racism. \n\nIn her speech she desciribed how she was a racist but learned to accept one specific POC individual as an exception because that particular person was good enough. Your mom shows **absolutely zero** awareness of how badly she told on herself by saying that, or why that was a disgusting thing to say in the first place.", "NTA. As you said, you are standing up for your wife and future family together. Your mother knew full well what she was saying in her speech. She was trying to ruin the day for your wife and her family. Letting everyone know that overall, she doesn\u2019t truly accept anyone non-white but she is willing to put up with your wife. That\u2019s some backhanded shit if I ever heard it. Like being brown or from a different race and culture is something that has to be tolerated instead of celebrated. No, you did what a real partner does. You stood your ground for yourself, your wife, and your boundaries. Your mother is racist and deserves to be handled like the filth she espoused. As a person in an interracial relationship too, if my partner went back to accept a racist parent I would have to wonder just how devoted he was to me and our relationship. Don\u2019t back down now, OP.", "NTA If your ILs love your mom so much, they can be friends with her. She obviously doesn't think she was wrong, or she would have called off her attack dogs. Stick to your guns. Your ILs don't get to make decisions like this about YOUR life.", "I understand why everyone is saying you should follow your wife\u2019s lead on this since technically she is the one your mother was insulting, but your wife is an adult. What you should be asking yourself is will I be able to trust her around my children? If the answer is no, cut her off now, it will be easier then doing it later.  If the answer is maybe (I really don\u2019t think the answer should be yes) then that should be the standard you\u2019re working towards, what behavior of hers you will need to see change before she is allowed to be a part of your lives again.", "Straight NTA from me for doing the right thing and protecting your wife. Even if she is your mum why put up with her bad behaviour when it is harmful to your wife and her family. Do not feel bad", "NTA! Racism isn\u2019t okay just because you\u2019re old. You proved to your wife that her well-being is more important than your mom\u2019s bigotry.", "NTA. Stand up for you person(your wife) always. You love her enough to marry her. Love her enough to keep your racist mom away from her.", "NTA \n\nHas your mother apologized? If not, then I don't see how you can reconcile at all. Remind your wife that the 2 of you have to be firm now to protect her and your future children.", "Nta, and I would 1) agree with your new wife (congratulations on what sounds like an otherwise great start to an awesome marriage) and 2) simply challenge every member of the family insisting that you should apologize do something for you: convince your mother to apologize to the bride and her entire family for the racist remarks she made, then be the direct contact when she does this to your future child(ren) who explains why they condone racism in their house where you and your wife do not.", "NTA, in the slightest. Your mother is 100% TA here, and if your family can\u2019t see that I\u2019d keep your wife and future kids away from them too.\n\nWhether you let your mum back into your life or not is your choice, of course. But I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you decided to go no contact.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a real piece of work.", "NTA, but if your wife thinks you should reconcile, I would do it on the condition that your mother apologizes directly to your wife (sincerely and concisely). From there, I would let your mother know that she's on \"probation\" - she has to earn back your and your wife's trust and until such a time you will be low contact.", "NTA the only apology needed is \"I am sorry you love being racist more than you love me. You stopped being my mother when you made that clear on my wedding day\"\n\n And what you say to the flying monkeys is \"If would rather stand behind a racist mother that child and his wife she chose to spew hate at on their wedding day, then delete my number. If not, do not speak to me about that woman again.\" \n\nWether or not you want to amend that, it is the root of everything you are feeling and what choices others have made.", "NTA - I would have kicked her out too. I imagine your wife and her family might feel guilty or see themselves as part of the reason for the rift with your mom (they\u2019re not), so it\u2019s natural for them to encourage reconciliation.

SHE should apologize.  \n\nTell all of them to pass that message along to her- that SHE what she did was wrong but SONS are important.  So if SHE wants to give an apology, that would be grand.  \nIf she gives YOUR WIFE (and you also) a heartfelt genuine apology, then MAYBE she'll get to meet her grandkids someday.  And she should be aware, that will be up to your wife as well as you.  \n\nBut in the mean time, you owe her no apology as you've done nothing wrong.  \n\nIf she knows 100% that you are not taking any of this shit, then she understands she has a choice to make.

After a few minutes, my mother left. My siblings, dad and my in-laws all agreed that I did the right thing and we went on celebrating. I knew my mother's family were all gossiping and talking shit but I didn't care. We left for our honeymoon and I muted everyone on my phone except my wife.\n\nWell we got back a few days ago and I unmuted everyone and everyone's still talking about it. My mother has been calling and messaging me non-stop. All of my mother's family have been calling me names and telling me what I did was wrong. My in-laws who were originally supportive of my decision told me I should get in contact with my mother and apologise and reconcile. They know what she did was wrong but mothers are important and it was one time and she now knows I am 100% about not taking any of this shit. I told them what my wife told me, that kicking her out of our wedding showed my wife and everyone that I won't tolerate any shit of any kind and that I did it for my wife, my in-laws, and our future children. \n\nThis has all caused a big rift in my family and I don't want to be on bad terms with my in-laws, I love them very much and I'm now thinking maybe they have a point and I should reconcile with my mother. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
