So I work for two weeks then I get a week off. \n\nMy wife and I have two kids. One if in middle school the other is in high school.  \n\nMy wife works as a teaching assistant for six hours three times a week.  \n\nWhen our youngest was still in elementary school my wife did not work.  So she took care of the house and everything while I was gone.  The weeks I was home I gave her a break.  I took over most of the chores and I took care of all the yardwork and such.  It worked for us.  \n\nAfter my wife went back to work last year stuff started changing.  I would get home and their would be dishes piled in the sink. The trash hadn't Beed taken out. The dogs hadn't been brushed.  That sort of thing.  \n\nI talked to my wife about what was going in and she said she was busy with work.  I asked if the kids were helping her and she said she didn't want to bother them and that she could keep up.  So I would spend my first couple of days off cleaning up the house.  No it wasn't that bad but I like to live in a clean area because my work is so dirty.  \n\nI have no problems bothering my kids. So between the three of us I would leave the house perfectly clean and organized when I left for work.  \n\nOver this last summer my wife was back on track.  But as soon as school started the house went back to being a pigsty when I got home.  \n\nI don't really think it's fair to spend two days cleaning after working 14 days of twelve hour shifts.  So I told my wife I was going to get a housekeeper to help her out.  \n\nShe said she didn't want someone in her house.  I said I really needed the house to be cleaned before I got home.  She said her and the kids would do it.  \n\nLong story short they did not.  \n\nSo I hired a housekeeper.  She comes the day before I get home.  She cleans the kitchen, living room, dining room, front entrance, and main bathroom.  She also does the laundry.  \n\nSo when I get home the house is clean and tidy.  And I make sure it stays that way until I leave.  I have two extra days that I can spend doing chores that need to get done and for myself.   \n\nMy wife was pissed off and tried to bring it up at Thanksgiving.  My mom was ready to give me hell for not doing my part since that was how she raised me until she heard the whole story.  Then her and my MIL started asking my wife if she needed help why didn't she call them to help with the housework.  So now they are coming over throughout my time at work to help my wife out.  \n\nI still kept the housekeeper because she does a great job.  But my wife is mad that my mom and her mom think she can't keep the house clean with the help of two teenagers.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671053219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm2q3b/aita_for_hiring_a_housekeeper_against_my_wifes/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You found a solution instead of fighting about it. \n\nYou wife seems unreasonable since she doesn\u2019t want to do it, but doesn\u2019t want a housekeeper to do it. And she doesn\u2019t want the kids to do it. So that leaves only you to do it.\n\nAnd 6 hours 3x a week isn\u2019t an Ironman schedule. Also, middle and high school kids should also be doing their share. They are going to be nightmares to their future partners if they never learn.", "I mean, it sounds like she can't keep it clean though? It certainly isn't fair to you. Plus it is best to get the kids involved. Too many young adults out there who don't know how to cook or clean because mommy dearest didn't teach them how to fend for themselves.\n\nAlso, I forgot a verdict. I'm leaning towards more of a NTA since you warned her. Also, site messed up and posted my comment twice. Deleted the other one.", " NTA. Your wife can either do it herself or allow someone else to do it. She can be mad or embarrassed but that\u2019s on her. Maid services exist for a reason and if you\u2019re willing to pay for it why not.", "NTA  \nI feel like it wasn't cool to go behind your wife's back like that, but at the same time, you: \n\n1. Clearly addressed the issue\n2. Proposed a solution the other party rejected\n3. Tried to compromise\n4. Were still left with the original problem\n\nI'm not really sure how else you could have done that tbh, and you don't say whether you told your wife \"I'm hiring a housekeeper, and that's that.\" I assume you did, and didn't just hire a housekeeper and let your wife discover a strange woman in her home cleaning one day, THAT would make you an asshole.  \n\n\nShe's mad that the moms thinks she can't keep the house clean... after she repeatedly failed to keep the house clean... so... yeah. lol", "Absolutely NTA\n\n\u201d But my wife is mad that my mom and her mom think she can't keep the house clean with the help of two teenagers.\u201d\u2026it\u2019s not that they *think* it\u2026it\u2019s that it\u2019s true!? She only works 18 hours a week, there is absolutely no good reason she can\u2019t keep the house up, she just chooses not to.\n\nYou sound like a wonderful (and very patient I might add) husband.  This is a *her* problem, not a you problem.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA she only works 18 hours a week and has no time to clean? It sounds like she just doesn't want to clean, and can't ask the kids BC then she would have to help them. The housekeeper is a great compromise BC she can keep doing very little and you don't come home to a pigsty. She sounds like she doesn't want your Moms to know she's a slob, but I'm sure they already know that. If she doesn't want someone in her house she better get to cleaning. It isn't fair that you come home for a week to clean their mess, rinse and repeat. She doesn't want to housekeeper because she's already got one, you!", "NTA\n\nYou gave her and your kids a chance to step up and keep the house clean. You now have time to rest and your wife and kids can keep doing what they were before you hired the housekeeper. I\u2019m sure your wife is embarrassed but that\u2019s on her.", "NTA and this is perfect way to solve the problem of chores not being done to one person's satisfaction. If your wife is mad that your mother and her mother think she can't keep the house clean with the help of two teenagers, then she shouldn't have brought it up. Because the facts are (i) your wife could not keep up on the housework, and (ii) you (rightly) don't want to spend your precious downtime cleaning the house when you can afford to pay someone else to do it.", "NTA. Getting a housekeeper seems like the perfect solution to the problem you two were having. \nBF and I both have demanding jobs, and we hired a housekeeper 1x a week, she does the hard cleaning and we just do the easy stuff to keep the house clean through the week. \nAnd wife does not get to be mad at you for mom and MIL knowing she can't keep the house clean when she was the one to tell them.\nThat been said sounds like your 2 teenagers should be having a clear list of chores they are responsible of, it will teach them independence and responsability.", "NTA. You've provided a solution that honestly most people would be thrilled with. I understand the strangers in the house thing and think it's reasonable that if your wife has an issue with this particular housekeeper that you look for another one.\n\nIt's not like you hired a housekeeper as a way of telling your wife she was failing. If the kids aren't pitching in can you help enforce those rules in any way? Other than that, this seems like a great solution that doesn't ask more of your wife than she's able to give.", "NTA.  I think you are doing a good job of figuring out how to get your own needs met without burdening your wife.", "NTA", " my mom and her mom think she can't keep the house clean with the help of two teenagers.\n\nShe can't and thats why you hired the housekeeper. \n\nNTA", "NTA!\n\nYou aren\u2019t expecting her to take care of everything all by herself. You also tried talking it out with her. And you even make sure to do the chores while you\u2019re home. None of this indicates that you have unreasonable expectations or lack of communication. It\u2019s kind of you to have gotten her help.", ">But my wife is mad that my mom and her mom think she can\u2019t keep the house clean with the help of two teenagers.\n\n(Morgan Freeman voiceover) She couldn\u2019t.\n\nIdk if the kids actually helped or not, but the signs point to \u201cno\u201d if the house still needed a housekeeper\u2026and your mom and MIL to help clean.\n\nNTA. it may be a pride thing with your wife, but if she can\u2019t do it and needs help, then she needs the help \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA: You have been reasonable with your requests and gave her plenty of opportunity. Sounds like it's not a financial issue so it's really up to her past this.", "NTA, but like, a *soft* NTA. Verging on ESH. It sounds like you feel like only your wife and kids need to have any cleaning responsibility, and if that's true then YTA. But if you're just asking everyone to put effort in equally (which they're clearly not doing) then yeah NTA. Also if you told her \"I am hiring a cleaner\" then NTA, but if you did it behind her back and a stranger just showed up at her house unexpectedly then YTA. I agree that the kids need to be helping out more and that she can at least keep the house somewhat clean since she is only working 18 hour weeks. I do understand why she feels bad about the mom's chiming in, she is probably feeling embarrassed or like they are shaming her. I would speak to them and ask them to get off her case. Maybe try to look for a different compromise besides a cleaner? Like a chore list for each person in the house. To help your wife and kids feel like you're not expecting them to do everything but to set up expectations of what they need to do to prevent having to hire a cleaner.\n\nEdit: spelling and clarity", "NAH\n\nAs long as the cost of the housekeeper isn't hurting your family, I believe you have come up with a very workable solution to the issue.", "NTA\n\nI think you did a great job being patient, explaining your needs, doing more than your share for a while and giving her and the kids multiple chances to do the housework themselves. Sometimes, it just doesn't work out, and as long as getting the extra paid help isn't putting a strain on your finances, I don't think there's anything wrong with maintaining it.\n\nYour wife is embarrassed, probably for multiple reasons. Not being able to keep up feels like a huge fail. Getting a stranger to help (esp paying for it) feels like salt on the wound. Having both mom's over as well, that's the biggest \"you suck at home life\" a person can get, especially if she's internalized home care as part of her wife / mother role. So, managing her feelings about this is going to be a big deal. You've made a clean house very important to you, now you have to back it off a bit - making it clear that it getting done is what's important, but not by whom (if that's how you feel), so that she doesn't keep seeing someone clean her house and feel it as a slap of inadequacy to her face with every swipe of the cleaning cloth. Build up other things that she does that you really value and appreciate so she knows she's valuable to you for more than just cleaning.", "NTA- and I don't get your wife's position about being torqued that people think it's too much. It's not like the evidence of this over time doesn't exist. It's almost angry making. Like- look, you keep saying you'll do it, but then you don't saying you're too busy. You can't have it both ways, either you handle it or we'll get it handled, but what  I'm not doing is coming home and spending my first 2 days off cleaning.", "NTA - but I\u2019m concerned about your wife. There was a point where I stopped cleaning and refused help because I was having depression. You gave a great solution for her and she\u2019s mad about it. I hope she\u2019s not taking it as a personal insult but it sounds like she is. She\u2019s not even asking your kids to help, which they are perfectly capable of doing because she doesn\u2019t want to bother them. \n\nAll of this to me sounds like she\u2019s isolating herself from help, she doesn\u2019t want anyone to know that she feels down and all that. So I would check to make sure she\u2019s actually doing alright and have a heart to heart conversation on why she keeps giving promises about cleaning that she isn\u2019t keeping and refusing help.", "ESH\n\nThis really spiraled out of control.\n\nYour wife needs to accept her shortcomings on this and teach your kids to help. (You didn't mention ages but even my 5 y.o. sets the table and clears her dirty dishes. The 10 y.o. empties the dishwasher and does his laundry. Both of them pick their stuff up and put it away. My husband and I had to teach them but they learned. None of this is rocket science.)\n\nYou absolutely should NOT have divulged all of the details to your mom and MIL to the point where they are also coming over to help clean. That must be humiliating for your wife.\n\nYour mom and MIL steamrolling your wife is a lack of boundaries that I can't even fathom.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't suggest that you ask your wife if she's ok and why the house was getting so out of control. That can be a sign of other issues.", "ESH. You for going behind your wife\u2019s back and doing something she was uncomfortable with. Your wife for not being open to find a solution that works for the both of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
