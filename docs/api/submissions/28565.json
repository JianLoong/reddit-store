Part of therapy and healing for this trauma is realizing that you can't control the world around you and instead learning to care for yourself when you need care.

That or she's hilariously (or selfishly) unaware of anyone's wants or needs but her own. \n\n\nClearly you and your friends have been catering to her and her needs for too long, for her to be so comfortable with: \n\n-complaining that you wouldn't invite her to something upsetting\n-come anyway\n-bring a date/stranger without asking you\n-bring her own food and expect you to prepare it for her\n-help herself to a couple of big free drinks\n-setting herself up to be triggered and locking you and your guests from being able to use the bathroom\n-made herself comfortable in your room, ignoring her date\n-complaining *again* that you didn't rearrange your night for her *while she was on a date*\n\nOh boy. If I was the one hosting, it would be the last time I invited her.  The level of disrespect is unacceptable.  If I was her date, I probably would have left and it certainly would have been the last time I see her. She created and fostered an environment of pure drama that kept your night focused on her. \n\nThis girl is used to everyone's time, energy and attention to be on her and *it shows*.  I don't understand from this snapshot exactly what you get out of this friendship but I would consider reevaluating the merits of keeping it.  She does not respect you.", "NTA, poor Tinder guy just wanted to get laid and walked into this shit show. Must have been thirsty to come get her.", "How old is she? NTA by any means, she sounds exhausting.", "Her behavior is embarrassing. Invites herself and a stranger over, makes herself comfortable in OP\u2019s bed, and then had the audacity to get mad that everything wasn\u2019t catered to her. The only thing she\u2019s done right here is not contacting OP since. It\u2019s best if she keeps that up.", "Even before demanding that someone change plans for her (despite knowing that a horror movie would be shown) she showed up with a complete stranger. To me I find it abhorrent manners to show up with an extra person without even asking the host and on top of that a tinder date that the host hasn't met? That's not right. I'm not having a stranger in my house. NTA. You told her it would be a horror movie, she is an adult responsibile for her own actions, she shouldn't have showed up if she wasn't gonna like the horror movie. Also she locks herself in YOUR bedroom? In YOUR home? And she expected you to change plans for her as if the world revolves around her.", "I mean, OP could have chosen a more cheerful movie.\n\nLike Midsommar.", "[removed]", "I showed \"Hereditary\" the last time I hosted a horror movie night, and one of the guests silently freaked out when he walked in halfway through the movie. He's usually loud and too rambunctious so I thought the quietly freaking out was a nice change of pace", "Seriously. I'm not a fan of sexual assault or intense gore in horror movies, so I check the rating for them before checking out a new horror movie. Some I even read the wiki ploy since 1) I get the gist and can prepare for specific scenes and 2) it also doesn't really spoil your enjoyment of a movie if you look it up.", "Exactly! And I hope hee Tinder date runs", "Yeah there's some things in horror that turn it from fun discomfort to genuine discomfort for me so i just like use the internet? Using [DoesTheDogDie.com](http://DoesTheDogDie.com) is the only reason I knew I'd like most of The Ritual and it still gave me enough notice to look away for some parts. I'd never go to a slasher night lol", "Same. NTA, OP. Your friend needs to learn that not everything revolves around her. When friends inform me after the fact \"we did this thing you hate without you\" my response is \"awesome! did you have a good time?\"\n\nIf there is a next time with her, be straight forward and say \"I'm inviting people over for a horror movie night. You're welcome to come, but be aware a gory horror movie will be starting at \\[time\\]. And, no, we're not changing the film \u2014 this is a horror movie night.\"", "Yep, this. I looooove horror movies but I know enough about Hereditary to know that it would be triggering for me to watch, so I haven't seen it! \n\nIf you have big issues with something it's on you to self-select out or remove yourself from the situation when it gets difficult for you. Going specifically to a showing of something that you know ahead of time will definitely be disturbing/triggering for you is not a good way to conduct yourself. It's not like she didn't know what was going to be shown or that the content was a surprise. You cannot expect your friend group to change horror movie night to something different just because you can't handle horror movies. Demanding to be invited to something you haven't been invited to is also not cool.", "I would be down for a Bluey night.", "This \u2013 she is not triggered, just scared", "NTA, but I would say the initial communication could have been a slight bit better. If this friend is normally part of these movie nights, she should have invited her with everyone else, then reached out to her to explain that OP is aware of her issues with scary movies and won't be offended if she doesn't want to come. Or given her an idea of when the movie would be over if she wanted to come by after. \n\nThat being said, none of that matters in comparison to her behavior at the actual party. On an AH scale of 1-100, I might give OP a 5 for not fantastic communication in the lead up. But the \"friend\" gets a solid 95 for her behavior. That poor Tinder date...", "You\u2019re all assholes. How do you know whether or not someone she knew was decapitated by a pole\u2026", "I had a similar thought, especially since she made her own little nest in his bed. It does feel very much like she's testing him and trying some weird power play to make him jealous or have him do whatever she wants.", "Why did the tinder date leave? Wouldn\u2019t they have waited around to take her to her home?\n\nShe definitely has a thing for OP.", "I was also thinking along this route for the same reasons. Weird loyalty test", "Best way to seduce someone - get another date and prove yourself an insufferable AH?", "At no point did OP identify themselves as male though.", "My thoughts exactly!", "Hey now! I stayed up to watch the midnight horror movie at 5. Albeit classic movies.", "The real question here!", "Seriously! How does this girl get away with pushing people around this way?! NTA", "It is possible to be triggered by a movie, or any media. For example, a veteran could be triggered by a war movie, if some scenes too closely resemble a traumatic incident from their real life experience.\n\nThat being said, the responsible thing to do if you are easily triggered is to avoid those triggers where possible until you can cope with them in healthy ways. If OP's friend is indeed triggered, this is not how to handle it.

It's not something you get invested in. But  it's fun, easy, relatable and honestly...\n\nWho HASN'T wanted to become one with the onesie?", "That she did to herself. They told her that they were showing a horror movie and she still came.", "It's entirely possible she was in fact triggered. I don't watch horror movies because they tend to have too much blood and the sight of blood like that is often triggering for me.", "We have no way to know that. She very well could have a trauma history. But it\u2019s on her to manage that, not her friend who gave her a super clear warning about the movie first.", "I would really like to know what definition a lot of people are using for triggered? The one i was taught was along the lines of **something or someone that causes someone to feel upset, frightened, or pain because they are made to remember something bad that has happened in the past** something along these lines can be say I can't around my ex because they were abusive and seeing them triggers me to feel pain based on my memories of said abuse. \n\nIt seems a lot of people are using triggered as a catch all term for any type of negative emotional reaction which is really unhelpful for the people that actually need it as a way to articulate something about their lived experience.", "Why would he come back?", "Hey, I didn't say it was a GOOD plan. I don't understand people who do this, but I know it happens.", "No ages provided, I could totally see someone young trying to pull something like this to get attention from their crush.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. She could have a thing for OP whether they\u2019re male of female and this was her weird way to try and make her play.", "I don't know if you realise: not everybody is straight.", "I don't think that matters but true that no pronouns were used and they're identifying them as male XD", "Agreed. No one forced that friend to be a guest that night. OP was up front about movie was going to be played and friend came over anyway. Why should the movie night for everyone change for 1 person", "I absolutely love The Witch and still probably pronounce it \u201cThe Vuh-Vitch\u201d\n\nDefinitely a font choice that stuck with people", "especially Sleepytime", "Baby Race!", "Omg, Onesies had me sobbing the first time I watched it.", "The grannies had me just about peeing my pants.", "You forgot Copycat", "Would you have gone to this movie night? The fact that she did makes me think she is more starved for attention than triggered.", "I could believe either. Regardless she had to business there and she knew it. I would be hesitant to ever allow her over again. Hard NTA.", "Trigger or just scared... either way, she knew what movie it was from the time she was invited, to the moment she chose to watch anyway, to the moment she freaked out, so to tell OP \"I thought you would change it for me\" is just attention seeking no matter what.", "If she had a problem with blood, wouldn\u2019t she have been triggered earlier on in the movie? It was a very specific scene that she reacted to, one the movie is famous for. This suggests she was selective in her reactions rather than a genuine, uncontrollable trauma response.", "Hereditary is particularly triggering. She couldn\u2019t have watched a more triggering horror film honestly. I love horror and I would have sat out of this movie night.", "And even if she was genuinely triggered, she was given sufficient notice of the movie and explicitly not invited. She has no one to blame but herself.", "Yeah, I hate horror movies. I don\u2019t even know what this is (and I don\u2019t want to). If my pal invited me to horror movie night \u2014 especially when they have regular movie nights \u2014 I\u2019d skip it and rejoin the group for the next one. It\u2019s October. Of COURSE people are doing horror movie nights. Op is NTA.", "tinder date guy actually sounds like a good guy and i feel bad for him too, tbh", "Probably because he has no clue he is the consolation prize. Or he was just a prop so she could pull her bs and see how OP acted. \n\nIf I was the tinder date I wouldn\u2019t have stuck around or returned to bring her home. That is way too much drama for me. She\u2019s a red flag factory.", "I\u2019m very gay, thank you - i\u2019m saying that OP didnt specify their gender and this answer was making assumptions about it.", "I don't know if you realize, the comment that person responded to said \"he\"", "I read it as OP being female. Based on the special chocolate covered popcorn recipe. But that would be latent bias rearing its ugly head.", "My bad \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but like, it could still be what's happening here.", "PERIOD", "Right? What a drama queen. She sounds annoying AF.", "100% not triggered. 100% attention seeking. She knew from the jump it was going to be a horror movie, but she came anyway *and* made sure she brought a date to up the spectacle-factor. It backfired. No one dropped what they were doing to accommodate her irrational behavior, so locking herself in the room for the duration was the only way she could save face at that point. \nSource: My narc mil does this shit regularly. \ud83d\ude44", "This, watching people die in movies is extremely upsetting for me and I just can't handle it anymore. Sucks cuz I actually use to love horror and thrillers. I also know that it upsets me and don't watch those movies anymore. I would have understood the lack of invitation and if i recieved one id have not gone without an explanation (simple thanks, but no thanks :)) cuz it's not about me. If i watched one unknowingly i would have left to a different room without making a scene. Sometimes I want to see a movie I'm worried is graphic and my boyfriend will watch it first then when we are watching either skip scenes or I'll look at my phone till he says to look up. But I only do that with him and he was the one to suggest it for me.", "Well, she thought OP would change the movie to accommodate her, so\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI can believe she\u2019s actually triggered by horror movies. The real issue here is her sense of entitlement. Once the movie started and it was made clear that OP was going to be showing a horror movie, she then probably allowed herself to be triggered to guilt trip OP for not accommodating her, like a tantrum from a toddler. Alternatively, given how much wine she downed before the movie even started, it also might not have clicked with her.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I\u2019m triggered by body horror. Part of knowing that ahead of time means not only can I avoid it, *but* I can also mentally prepare myself for what lies ahead if I choose to engage. Some body horror turns out to be less of a big deal than what it sounded like, and I can breeze past it. Other times, it\u2019s worse than what I imagined, and I have to deal with that. But that\u2019s the thing\u2026 My feelings are entirely mine to deal with. OP\u2019s friend is shifting blame and making this other people\u2019s problem.", "I personally would have skipped this movie night. I live alone and have a very overactive imagination. I don't even like to see the commercials for scary movies. OP's guest is a drama queen who should have stayed home.", "Yeah I honestly didn't even realize it until you pointed it out. Like I said elsewhere, that's my bad, I never meant to misgender anyone. \n\nI think my logic was, she came with a date who was male. If she was trying to make OP jealous, there's a good possibility that OP is also male because otherwise that strategy would not work. (I don't think trying make people jealous is effective/reasonable/practical regardless, but that doesn't stop some folks from trying.) \n\nBut obviously, as you pointed out, that was an assumption I made and shouldn't have.", "akdhgshsd omg I misinterpreted things. Sorry, I am many things and tired is seven of them atm", "Yeah, I'd tell her I'm triggered by annoying, attention-seeking drama queens so we can't be friends anymore."]}
