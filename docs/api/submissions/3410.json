A bunch of my friends from work added to it. At first, it was just the people i hung out with outside of work, just like 20 people, but then a few of my friends asked if I could grant access to a few more people who'd heard about it and wanted in. Then a few turned into a lot.\n\nAnd in a week, the only people it was missing was the CEO, the VP, my immediate manager, a few other managers and directors of different departments, and all of HR.\n\nI decided to crunch some numbers, like figuring out average pay by education level, senority, etc.. \n\nWell, I found out that a pretty big indicator of pay wasn't any of the things I started looking at, it was gender. Across literally any job role, any education level, there was like a 25 to 35 percent lower pay... I was pretty shocked and mad. \n\nSo I kind of impulsively emailed the head of HR and the CEO, only running it by my mentor who's in management, but she's honestly super bullheaded like me and she encouraged me to send it but be ready for some backlash. \n\nI basically told them that I'd found evidence of pay disparities across roles, then a table of each role in the company, and the average salary for men and women in that role. I didn't include the whole spreadsheet, just stats calculated from it. \n\nWell, they had a fuckin lawyer contact me. The next day, over \"accessing confidential information\" like I'd hacked them. I sent an email to reply saying I didn't do that, it was all voluntarily discussed, which is protected by law. \n\nAnd it created a shitstorm I don't even know the size of yet. A bunch of people are upset with me because they've been getting shit from their bosses for adding to it, once management knew it exists, my boss is fuckin furious at me for \"going over his head\" like that, and he's saying I'm risking his job?? And I have a meeting with like a panel of people tomorrow including hr, the ceo, and the lawyer, but I think I'm going to reschedule till I can get some council because I'm nervous talking to the lawyer alone because I honestly don't know a lot about law except the real basics.\n\nThis is probably gonna make me sound like a dumbass but I genuinely didn't expect all this shit.

So I figured they hadn't run the stats themselves, and would actually care to fix it.\n\nLike when other people had raised concerns like \"we can't dispose of waste like that, legally it has to be like this\" or \"shit we forgot an engineering process step, we need to tell the client we'll need to deliver late to make things safe\" it was genuinely well recieved and stuff got handled! \n\nWell nope, it feels like everyone is pissed at me and I'm honestly pretty stressed for my job.\n\nAITA for making that spreadsheet?", "created_utc": 1669607958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6m3v9/aita_for_keeping_a_spreadsheet_of_what_everyone/", "score": 550, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
