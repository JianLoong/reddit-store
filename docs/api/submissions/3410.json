A bunch of my friends from work added to it.

Then a few turned into a lot.\n\nAnd in a week, the only people it was missing was the CEO, the VP, my immediate manager, a few other managers and directors of different departments, and all of HR.\n\nI decided to crunch some numbers, like figuring out average pay by education level, senority, etc.. \n\nWell, I found out that a pretty big indicator of pay wasn't any of the things I started looking at, it was gender. Across literally any job role, any education level, there was like a 25 to 35 percent lower pay... I was pretty shocked and mad. \n\nSo I kind of impulsively emailed the head of HR and the CEO, only running it by my mentor who's in management, but she's honestly super bullheaded like me and she encouraged me to send it but be ready for some backlash. \n\nI basically told them that I'd found evidence of pay disparities across roles, then a table of each role in the company, and the average salary for men and women in that role. I didn't include the whole spreadsheet, just stats calculated from it. \n\nWell, they had a fuckin lawyer contact me. The next day, over \"accessing confidential information\" like I'd hacked them. I sent an email to reply saying I didn't do that, it was all voluntarily discussed, which is protected by law. \n\nAnd it created a shitstorm I don't even know the size of yet. A bunch of people are upset with me because they've been getting shit from their bosses for adding to it, once management knew it exists, my boss is fuckin furious at me for \"going over his head\" like that, and he's saying I'm risking his job?? And I have a meeting with like a panel of people tomorrow including hr, the ceo, and the lawyer, but I think I'm going to reschedule till I can get some council because I'm nervous talking to the lawyer alone because I honestly don't know a lot about law except the real basics.\n\nThis is probably gonna make me sound like a dumbass but I genuinely didn't expect all this shit.

So I figured they hadn't run the stats themselves, and would actually care to fix it.\n\nLike when other people had raised concerns like \"we can't dispose of waste like that, legally it has to be like this\" or \"shit we forgot an engineering process step, we need to tell the client we'll need to deliver late to make things safe\" it was genuinely well recieved and stuff got handled! \n\nWell nope, it feels like everyone is pissed at me and I'm honestly pretty stressed for my job.\n\nAITA for making that spreadsheet?", "created_utc": 1669607958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6m3v9/aita_for_keeping_a_spreadsheet_of_what_everyone/", "score": 368, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to document like your job depends on it. \n\nNTA. Fight the power", "People have given very good advice, I am not touching that, instead. \n\nThank you, for doing this", "YTA for doing this impulsively, without a plan, or giving a heads up to any of your coworkers. You created a shitstorm for other people. \nI could care less about the company or CEO, they deserve whatever heads their way.", "Man that's funny how the percentages neatly line up with the fake stats all over the internet.", "NTA\n\nImportant job. Thanks for doing it.", "NTA\n\nHire a lawyer and document EVERYTHING that has happened so far, save all the emails, note down conversations you\u2019ve had with your boss to the best of your ability to remember them and the time when they happened.  Document document document. And keep all of this documentation in a separate specific place. On it\u2019s own thumb drive, in it\u2019s own notebook. If this goes to court they will likely subpoena the information you have collected and having it all contained in separate areas will limit the things they have access to.\n\nEdit: forgot to add the obligatory I\u2019m not a lawyer", "NTA, but almost criminally na\u00efve which in real world impact can be just as bad. You really were totally unaware of the multitude of high profile lawsuits, up to the Supreme Court, about the gender pay gap? Or did you think those were one off issues and not a systemic problem? Good on you for trying to make it right, but blundering in like a bull in a china shop without consulting a lawyer has put every female colleague you have in danger. The company now has all the info you do, and a huge incentive to prove that those women \u201cdeserve\u201d the lower pay. Get a lawyer who specializes in whistleblowing and labor issues, and don\u2019t talk to the company again without the lawyer present.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t improve if it\u2019s not known about. Lawyer up and keep fighting the good fight.", "NTA. Of course this is nuking your career, but lawyer up and you could come out of this with severance and a promised positive reference.", "NTA, in the US it is also illegal to retaliate against workers for discussing wages. What you discovered was no accident which is why they are pissed, the only way we can keep tabs on pay discrimination is to discuss it (this exact situation and pay issue is exactly why workers need a union).\n\nAlso, you need to discuss this with an employment law attorney. And keep documentation of what's going on.", "NTA - legally protected. But yeah get some lawyer / protection on your side!", "NTA, TELL them the meeting needs to be rescheduled according to your lawyers availability and that you require any questions to be put to you IN WRITING prior to the meeting in order that you will accorded procedural fairness and natural justice.", "YTA!!  NEVER DISCUSS PAY WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES!  It creates resentment and problems.   You fucked around and found out.  You SHOULD lose your job over this.", "NTA, in fact I'm quite proud", "Everyone is saying NTA but how does it work in US (assuming OP is based there)?Where I live in Europe kind of everyone working for companies has a privacy policy that states that you cannot disclose these type of info about your job. Surely not with coworkers. If I did the same, I would easily get fired.", "NTA. Get a lawyer ASAP. \n\nLooking back, if you had retained counsel, they could have advised in what to do in lieu of that email (or advised on what to say in it) but nonetheless it would serve you best to get counsel, NOW. BTW- save all that info in the Google doc separately (download it, save on personal email, print, etc.) Get a list of everyone who has access, etc. Save every piece of info you have regarding it. Print everything from your work accounts\u2014do not electronically forward that to yourself or anywhere.", "And across the board, men just happen to be higher performers by 25-35%...", "One of the few federal labor protections we gave here in the US is the right to discuss our working conditions and compensation with our coworkers. Companies still try everything they can to prevent it, and proving retaliation isn\u2019t all that easy. So what the OP did is legal, but in a practical sense very dangerous for them and for everyone who contributed to the spreadsheet.", "I can understand that some people might feel uncomfortable about this having gone to the CEO without them getting a heads-up, but ultimately the reason people wanted to participate in your spreadsheet is almost certainly to see if they were being paid fairly, so this is the logical result.\n\nNTA.\n\nI think you're doing the right thing, bith with this data and in getting a lawyer. If you have access to your work emails or communications with colleagues that took place on official platforms then copy everything. Send everything to yourself. Do it before you communicate with them any more.\n\nI'm not in the US and I realise office and professional culture is different, but one woman to another, don't doubt for a second if you did the wrong thing. Often there are ways we could have handled things better, but that doesn't negate the rightness of the actions.\n\nGood luck!", "I see. Then NTA", "Exactly", "[removed]", "Before recording, you should check the laws of the state you are located in. If it\u2019s a two party record to consent state, you need actual consent to do so. If it\u2019s only one party consent to record, bring a recording pen with you.", "'Right to Work' means you can't be forced to join a union as a condition of employment.\n\n'At-Will' means they can fire you at any time without a specific reason.", "NTA, and you need to see a lawyer immediately.", "> NTA, American corporate greed is the real AH here.\n\nI think people who unleash bots on Reddit are the real AHs, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nEdit: I meant bots that pretend to be humans and do a bad job of it, thereby wasting people\u2019s time and brainpower.  My apologies to all the fun bots out there.", "Nope. As long as you verbally announce that you are recording, it\u2019s legal in two-party consent states. I know this from personal experience.", "This is not true in all areas."]}
