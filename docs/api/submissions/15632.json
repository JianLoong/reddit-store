I was 17 and it was my moms 7th baby (although she had may miscarriages before the 5th sibling was born, she was meant to have a twins but my mom lost one not long in second trimester), my so called friend made a joke about my mom being like a bunny rabbit.

A similar thing happened to my mom. Her in laws treated it like gossip and spoke behind her back and it got back around to my brother who was a small child and confused. Please be careful leaving your kids around her in the future. Even if your kids have a play date with your nephew, the nephew might repeat things he overheard unknowingly. You weren\u2019t being sensitive and had a valid reaction. Them making light of it crosses boundaries, invalidates you and your personal family trauma, and was just flat out not their place to comment on how you should react. I hope your husband stands firm by your side in this and I wish you the best!", "I saw she stated in another comment that they were all well aware and knew about it. It\u2019s so unbelievably disgusting. Not only the \u201cjoke\u201d itself, but how they have the audacity to tell her how to feel and react about it. It pisses me off."]}
