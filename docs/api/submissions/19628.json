We do have kids but our kids are homeschooled so traveling wouldn't be an issue and my wife saw it as a way to involve them in the curriculum because we can go to historical sites and \"teach them the correct history\" versus just follow history text. I thought it was a great idea honestly. The kids were absolutely fucking stoked. Couldn't wait to get on the road. We had trouble finding an RV though. We have been searching for months. \n\nNow.. my wife is much more laid back than I am. So are the kids, admittedly. I enjoy my AC and my electricity, whereas my wife and kids would be happy as pigs in shit to live off grid. I do love that about them and wish I could be more like that but I grew up very privileged and certain luxuries are something I can't go without (ie: AC, TV, music, a real shower, microwave, ice freezer, my gaming PC, etc). So I was looking for something that had space and had all working appliances. Well, my wife found one. The work that needed to be done was purely cosmetic. We go and buy the camper and I hauled it to the house yesterday. \n\nWell, the people who sold it to us lied. The AC does not work and neither does the freezer. Easy fixes, sure, but it was just the fact that we were lied to. So I start getting pissed and my wife said \"please don't ruin this for me\" (she was over the moon excited about this camper). I snapped back with \"it's already fucking ruined for me\". She stomps off to the house and soon after leaves with the kids. Later on in the night I said \"I'm sorry, I truly just hate being lied to.\" She said \"So go ahead and be pissed. You've already knowingly ruined the idea of this for me after I asked you not to because you are selfish, so I don't give a fuck what you bitch about anymore. Everything was so easily fixed but you couldn't even step back and stop being a dick for 2 seconds so I could be happy.\" She won't speak to me and isn't doing the deep clean she wanted to either. She won't even go near the camper. AITA?\n\nETA: I couldn't check the appliances because it wasn't hooked up to the electric when I got there. These people lived on a campsite and had been there for years in the camper they sold us and had already moved in their replacement camper. The camper they sold us was off on the dirt turn around with a for sale sign, no where near a hook up. And yes, as people are saying, there are issues in the marriage.
