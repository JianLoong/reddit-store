As you can imagine, it's a lot of work taking care of all of them on my own.\n\nRecently, I've been relying on my oldest child a lot to help me out with the younger two. They're at an age where they need a lot of attention, and I just can't give it to them all the time. My oldest child is very responsible and mature for their age, so I don't see any harm in asking them to help out.\n\nHowever, my oldest child has been complaining lately about having to take care of their siblings. They say that it's not their job to look after them all the time, and that they have their own life to worry about. They're always busy with schoolwork, friends, and extracurricular activities.\n\nI understand where they're coming from, but at the same time, I feel like they're being selfish. They're the oldest, so it's their responsibility to help out. I never had an older sibling to help me out when I was a kid, so I had to do everything on my own.\n\nI tried talking to them about it, but they just got angry and stormed off. I feel like I'm in a tough spot here - I can't take care of all three kids on my own, but I don't want to force my oldest child to do something they don't want to do.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for expecting my oldest child to take care of their siblings?", "created_utc": 1677264579, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ayt92/aita_for_expecting_my_oldest_child_to_take_care/", "score": 406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's their responsibility as a 14yo to help around the house, and potentially babysit sometimes. NOT to help raise your children.\n\n>I can't take care of all three kids on my own\n\nThat means it's time to get other adults involved, not lean on a 14yo. That might mean asking family for help. It might mean applying for government assistance. It might mean putting your kids in free after-school care. It might mean reaching out to their father. In short it is on YOU that you have 3 kids, it is not on your eldest child to handle your life decisions.", ">They're the oldest, so it's their responsibility to help out.\n\nYTA - no it isn't their responsibility, not at all.

Don't have kids you can't take care of.", "YTA this feels fake because it's so perfectly written to upset reddit.\n\nIf its not, as the 10 year old in this situation when I was growing up, my brother raised me, it destroyed our relationship because no 15 year old is prepared for 2 kids Not even for 'just a few hours a week' he was a kid but he was under so much stress because it was his responsibility to make sure we got our homework done and did our chores all while he had his own. He screamed, he cried, he was a kid way over his head and all 3 of us suffered for it. It took a long time to build a real relationship with him and its still very weak.", "Don't come here asking for judgment if you're just gonna disagree with everyone in the comments.

My auntie was the eldest of 7 and had a huge issue with her mother because she was expected to raise her younger siblings.  \n\nYou chose to have them, you get to raise them!

Did you read out loud what you just wrote?", "YTA - That's called Parentification and is actually a type of abuse.  You chose to have 3 kids, you raise 3 kids.

My father has apologised and regrets dumping me with it but my mother never, ever admitted her wrongs. It ruined my \"childhood\". While it's not unreasonable to expect the older one to spend a bit of time with their siblings, it should be as siblings. Playing and hanging out. It's never OK to expect them to take a parental role. Never. You have to do better. Other people manage and you will have to too.", "YTA! \"Very mature for their age\" is a nice way of saying \"had to learn to grow up way too fast.\" It sounds more like you rely on your oldest to do all of the parenting for your youngest children, and not just the occasional babysitting. Your oldest child is still a CHILD. You made the choice to have kids, they didn't. Grow up and learn to be a better parent to ALL of your kids.", "(I already voted YTA). Just adding:   \n **Parentification**\nDefinition:\n\n**Parentification** A form of role reversal, in which a child is inappropriately given the role of meeting the emotional or physical needs of the parent or of the family\u2019s other children.\n\n**Leaning on Little People**\n\nSome parents attempt to delegate part of the responsibility for meeting either the parent\u2019s own emotional and physical needs, or the emotional and physical needs of other family members, to one of their children.\n\n**The usual target is the eldest or most emotionally or physically mature child in the family.** In some cases, a child of the opposite sex is chosen to meet the emotional and physical needs of the parent and assume the role of a \u201csurrogate spouse\u201d. For these Parentified children, there may be expectations they will sacrifice normal childhood needs like play, friendships with peers, sleep or schooling.\n\n**There are two common types of Parentification: physical and emotional.**\n\n**Physical Parentification (Also Called Instrumental Parentification)** occurs when a child is given the responsibility of looking after the physical needs of the parent and/or the other siblings. This can include duties such as cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, paying bills, managing the household budget, getting kids ready for school, supervising homework, dispensing medications or imposing discipline on younger children.\n\nPhysical Parentification is different from assigning a normal, healthy level of household chores to children, as it involves an unfair level of responsibility and allows the actual parent to abdicate part of their own responsibility for care of the children. It also becomes dysfunctional when the task assigned is beyond the developmental maturity of the child or where the assigned duties leave little or no time for the child to engage in normal childhood activities.\n\n**Emotional Parentification** happens when a child is made responsible for looking after the emotional and psychological needs of the parent and/or the other siblings.\n\nThis can include cases where the parent begins to confide in the child, discussing their own adult problems and issues, and effectively using the child as a surrogate spouse or therapist. This kind of Emotional Parentification is sometimes referred to as \u201cemotional incest\u201d.\n\nOther siblings, taking their cues from the parent, may also attempt to unburden themselves on the child.\n\n**How it Feels**\n\nChildren are often anxious to please their parents and a Parentified child will often take their responsibilities very seriously. They may even feel honored initially by being treated like a \u2018grown up\u2019 and entrusted with responsibility for other family members or their parent. However, the child will generally suffer from having his or her own emotional needs neglected and from being compelled to live up to the burden of expectation. \nParentified children may struggle with lingering resentment, explosive anger and difficulty in forming trusting relationships with peers, issues which often follow them into adulthood. Forming close, trusting romantic and spousal relationships may be particularly difficult.", "YTA\n\nYour oldest deserves to be a child, not a caretaker. It doesn't matter if they're mature for their age. They're not selfish for not wanting to take care of the younger siblings.", "Not even gonna read it title is enough. YTA. They aren't parents, they didn't ask to be caretakers, there kids. You chose to have a child, you're responsible for said child", "YTA  MAJOR.\n\nA.  This is called Parentification.  There is a reason there is a Mental Health term for it.  Is is NOT a good thing.\n\nB.  As the \"oldest\" who basically lost a huge part of my childhood/teenage years due to my mother's requirement that I take care of the younger siblings, I can tell you that you are destroying their relationships.  The oldest will grow to resent the younger siblings more and more each time they can't do what a normal teenager does, basically each and every day!\n\nc.  You are going to destroy your relationship with your eldest.  She will NOT forgive the time/events you have stolen from her requiring her to do YOUR job.  \n\nYou CHOSE to have children.  They are you and their other parent's responsibility.  PERIOD.\n\nIt only took until me and my siblings were in our 30s to finally have any kind of decent relationship.

I'm really hoping this is fake and that you really didn't come to this sub and think that anyone would be on your side. You are the one that decided to have children, not your oldest. These are your children and your responsibility. \n\nAs the oldest child who had to take care of my siblings because my mother, who I am very LC with, couldn't deal with having 4 of us, I'm telling you that your oldest will resent you for this.", "\u201cI can\u2019t take care of three kids on my own\u2026\u201d\n\nWow. Well, you have them. So you better figure it out. And remember you do have 3 kids - not two kids and a live in nanny. \n\nYTA", "YTA. you\u2019re the parent, not your oldest. cant handle 3 kids? shouldn\u2019t have had 3 kids. it up to you to parent them. not parent themselves band each other", "YTA\nIt's not your oldest child's fault that you had more children.\n\n\nIts not their fault you apparently dont have the time or ability to properly care for your younger children yourself.\n\n\nWhy doesn't your oldest child deserve to enjoy their childhood as much as their younger siblings? Why are you punishing them for being mature and well-behaved? Why does your oldest child deserve to have their happiness sacrificed for the younger ones? I'll bet your kid wonders to themselves why you love their siblings more than you love them and why their siblings matter so much more to you. They're not being selfish, they're being a child. You're holding a 14 year old to an adult standard and blaming them for not being your co-parent.\n\n\nWhat is your plan when your eldest resents you and their siblings for the loss of their childhood? How are you going to make it up to them? Because unless you have a time machine you can't. Parents always think their kids \"will understand when they're older\" or you'll \"make it up to them\" but the reality is you cant, nothing can ever change the choices you made and there is no rule or guarantee that your child will forgive you or want you in their life at all, so you need to do right by your kids the first time around. You have to be a better parent now, because apologizing later for being a poor parent won't fix anything and wont be good enough. You have a very limited time with your kids, oldest will be grown and out of the house before you know it and you won't get that time back, ever.", "YTA - YOU are the parent, not your oldest child. Let your child live his life and become a parent when *he* is ready to do so. Your kids, your responsibility.", "Yta.\n\nI am an oldest child, at one point the oldest of three, and your child is right. Their younger siblings are NEVER their responsibility, and they should be focusing on their own life instead of looking after your other two children.\n\nI can, so some degree, understand that three children can be a handful. However, it's a choice you made and so one you should be handling. Your oldest should not be burdened with your responsibilities.", "YTA. A 14 year-old is a child too.

Your oldest had no say in becoming an older brother and, according to you, responsible for younger siblings. **You** decided to have more kids. **You** need to be the one to take care of them.", "Yes, YTA for relying on your 14yo to help parent your other children. You and the children\u2019s father decided to bring these lives into this world, and they are your shared responsibility (assuming he is still living).", "Yep! YTA. Your younger kids are not your eldest kid\u2019s responsibility. They\u2019re yours. She did not make the decision to have them. You did. Stop parentifying your oldest before you cause even more resentment.", "YTA . ITS NOT AND AGAIN I SAY NOT Your child's responsibility to care for their siblings.  It was your choice to have 3 children and they are YOUR responsibility.  I truly can't stand parents with such expectations.", "YTA. This is a type of abuse called parentification.\nWhile you can ask your children to help out on a very occasional or emergency basis, you should not expect them to help you out regularly. You are robbing your child of their childhood and ability to grow up emotionally regulated.

It is YOUR responsibility.", "YTA 100%. \n\nWhat you are doing is called parentification, and it's a form of child abuse. \n\nThis, right here, makes you the absolute AH in the situation: \n\n>They're the oldest, so it's their responsibility to help out.\n\nNo, a 14 year old child is not in any way responsible for helping raise their siblings. No. No. No. One more time: NO. \n\nAnd this is just ridiculous: \n\n>I'm in a tough spot here - I can't take care of all three kids on my own\n\nSHOULD'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE HAVING THEM. And I am not interested in whatever sob story you have about your single parenthood. Not everyone is a single parent by choice, but we all know it's always a possibility to end up single even when we are happily in love. \n\nThe only person responsible for raising and looking after your three kids (that's right, the eldest needs a parent too) is YOU. And their other parent(s), but if they aren't in the picture it's up to you to figure it out --either enforce their involvement or whatever solution you come up with. \n\nYour eldest is a child. They are legally and ethically entitled to their childhood. Babysitting or helping raise other children should never be in their to-do list. They can watch their siblings a little while here and there, as a favor. But you full-on expecting a 14 year old to co-parent with you is... I have no words. \n\nBe a better parent or you'll find yourself childless by the time the youngest is 18.", "Yes, yta\n\nParentifaction of children is a form of abuse. \n\nIt is NOT your child's responsibility to look after YOUR children. If you need help, you can hire a babysitter, nanny, or mother's helper. You could also ask if they would be willing to babysit in exchange for the current market value for that service.\n\nIf you could not care for 2(?) children, you should not have had them. Seriously, we not counting the oldest, a 10 year old should be semi-self sufficient (and if their not, that's your fault), and you can't watch a 6 year old? why not?", "YTA \n\nThey are your kids.

Your responsibility is to provide an environment for them to do so.", "Just want to add another YTA.  If your goal is to drive away the oldest so they go no contact when they turn 18 then I guess you are doing a great job!", "YTA. You say that you never had an older sibling to help you and you had to do everything on your own but don\u2019t seem to realize that not only does your oldest not have an older sibling to help them, you are also expecting them to take care other your other kids. That is not a fair expectation.

Your child is that, your CHILD. Not a free nanny. And they're right, it's not their job to take care of YOUR other children.\n\nAdult life is miserable and full of unwanted responsibilities anyway. Every kid should have the right to be just a kid, not a part-time parent.", "YTA and you're creating a dynamic that may result in your oldest eventually having little or no contact with you and their siblings because you're not treating them equally or fairly.

You're asking your oldest to give up their own childhood during formative years to raise their siblings for you.  It's a really tough spot to be in.

But you\u2019re essentially telling them that since you\u2019re a single parent, it\u2019s their responsibility to step up and act like a parent to their younger siblings. It\u2019s called parentification, and it often results in resentment and low contact/ no contact once they turn 18. You have time to turn this around, but you have to start now. Good luck.\n\nETA: it\u2019s amazing how you lack the ability to see how YOU are the one being selfish for expecting your 14yo to parent your children for you. Your 14yo is not being selfish.", "YTA they didn't have 3 kids, you did. I'm sorry that it's hard for you but your 14 year old is allowed to focus on school, friends and such.

It\u2019s not their \u201cresponsibility\u201d to caretake their siblings, they are a child. Your oldest is right, schoolwork, social life and extracurricular activities should be their priority.\n\nYOU are the parent, so parent your fuckin kids. \n\nYTA", "Oh boy, have you come to the wrong place if you're expecting agreement!\n\nUnequivocally, yes! YTA.\n\nSomewhere along the way in your life, you decided to become a parent. If you were single and struggling with one, then NOT having a second and third were no brainers. Again, that's if you were single and struggling. You gave no particulars into the whys of how you are a single parent. The fact remains that you are the adult on duty and it should remain that way.\n\nThere is a marked difference between everyone having 'household responsibilities' and being a caretaker to younger siblings. You mentioned the eldest is expected to put away their toys. A 10 year old and 6 year old can definitely do those tasks themselves. The 10 year old should be able to set the table or be starting to wash dishes by now. The six year old can be shown how to fold their own laundry. That is everyone sharing responsibilities in a household, that is not an issue. \n\nYou mention that you get overwhelmed. When that happens, what are you expecting from the eldest? If you're expecting that they will be 'keeping younger siblings out of trouble' or helping with homework, or entertaining them while you rest, or constantly being made responsible for feeding/bathing/making sure siblings do.....whatever, this is the descent into the slippery slope of the form of child abuse known as parentification of a minor. Any time the older sibling is expected to take on the responsibility of rearing their siblings in a day to day manner, it's a problem. \n\nParents like yourself tend to use the innocuous expression 'helping out' to cover your own shortcomings and failure to develop a sufficient community of adults to help you. You have hundreds of people on this sub like myself that were forced to parent our siblings while our parents worked, partied, or were otherwise neglectful. While our parents said we were 'mature for our age', we DID NOT have the life skills or maturity to perform all the tasks that were thrust upon us. We are all still traumatized by it to this day in some form or another.  There's a resentment deep down in our core that is still there not only for our parent, but our siblings, too. Stop before you willfully add your daughter to our ranks.", "YTA really do you even pay her an allowance. Your the one having them why is it her responsibility to help.

That kid is not an adult, and isn\u2019t your babysitter. Want him to fix a sandwich for the 6 year old after school? That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s like one of his chores.

Your oldest is correct.  It's not their job to care for their siblings.  That's your job unfortunately.  Plus you're forcing the 14 years to grow up sooner than they need to.

Money is a motivator at that age.  Work out a schedule and have some balance so your 14 year doesn't feel like their time is being monopolized.

It is in no way selfish for your child to not want to spend their life taking care of their siblings. YOU are the parent. It is YOUR responsibility to handle childcare, whether that means hiring someone when you have to be at work or elsewhere or doing it yourself.

However, I want to stress that I strongly feel u/Jolly_Tooth_7274 is taking it a bit too far. See, Parentification is abuse... when it's extreme and crosses certain lines. There are spaces and balance in which to teach a child responsibility, chores, and helping around the house - but there is a space where it goes too far, too.\n\nThe briefest explanation is that the child shouldn't taken on the \"role\" of a parent. They have to live their life as a child. This may mean babysitting can at times become a chore, but only in certain conditions. Experts recommend a child isn't left over night unless the eldest is at least 16 years old. Their labor should be compensated - they are working after all... and if you're seeing signs of your child pushing back it's likely causing problems.\n\nWhen this crosses over into parentification and abuse, it can leave serious mental scars and harm. Your child isn't quite old enough to be in this role, but you also aren't clear in what \"helping out\" here means. \"Looking after?\" What are you asking them to do? Help with homework? Manage them doing household chores? Watch the house while you're out (for work or other reasons?) This really can cross the line in big, big ways. \n\nI urge you to read up on parentification in greater depth and then discuss with your fourteen year old **reasonable** roles for them to play and learn to be respectful of their boundaries. \n\nSingle parent households are tough. Households really do need a lot of hands to function properly but turning to children is often more problematic. Good luck.\n\nAnd without more info, sounds like YTA", "YTA.\n\nYour oldest is 14.

It wasn't to the point where I was the point of contact for their teachers, because I was only 2-5-8 years older than each of them, but they were always more disappointed when I didn't go to their sports or concerts instead of our parents. \n\nI ended up NC with both my parents for some time after I moved out, and I have a somewhat strained relationship with two of my brothers. My relationship with my parents is better now, but my brothers are still entitled jerks.\n\nThere's a point where you want to foster care for family with your children, I understand that. But there's a fine line between doing chores and helping around the house and shoving off your parenting responsibilities onto your oldest child.
