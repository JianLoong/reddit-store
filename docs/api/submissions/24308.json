He\u2019s the one who suggested skipping those dances, and it\u2019s not like they happen at all weddings anyway.  Sure, they\u2019re common, but it\u2019s not on some Required For Weddings, Mandatory Must-Do list that you\u2019re stuck adhering to.

The absolute *last* thing I would ever want to do is to cause her pain, particularly on our wedding day. So it was *my* idea to skip the parent-child dances because I don't want to emphasize her losses/painful moments from her past on a day that is supposed to be focused on joy and our joint future. If you care about me, I would ask you to respect my decision. But regardless, the decision has been made and the topic is now closed.\"\n\nWhen I saw the title, I really thought it might be that your fianc\u00e9 wants a mother-son dance, but you were forbidding it. And if that was happening, I would tell you that your wedding is about both of you and that if a particular tradition is meaningful/important to your fianc\u00e9 (especially since this specific tradition doesn't require your participation...heck, it doesn't even require that you are in the room), you need to have a pretty good reason why you don't want him to do it.\n\nBut that isn't what's happening here... Your fianc\u00e9 is the one who suggested it and you have to trust that if he suggested it, he is comfortable with the decision. But that does also mean he is responsible for communicating the decision to his family and ensuring that they do not view you as the villain who is forcing this decision on him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. We danced together and then opened the dance floor to all people for our wedding. My MIL was partly paralyzed later in life and she couldn\u2019t dance with her son. My dad didn\u2019t mind dancing with me with the dance floor full of people. He understood that having a moment to shine at the expensive of my MIL would be awful.   \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your fianc\u00e9s family doesn\u2019t seem to understand that for your mil to have her moment, you\u2019d have to be awkward and upset. She can dance with her son while the dance floor is full.", "NTA if your husband doesn't want it either then it's not bad. Your wedding not theirs.", "NTA only because it was your fiances idea so I assume he is fine without the family dance. Honestly I don't think it would be that awkward to skip over it and if you just did a family dance at the same time together with several members of the family on the floor it would be even less awkward but it is your guys decisions. As long as he is fine giving up a special dance no one else's opinion matters.", "NTA. They want you to hurt *at your own wedding* so your MIL gets to have her moment, a moment her own son had said he didn't need.\n\nThe fact that everyone just wants you to \"find someone\" so she can have her dance shows a profound lack of understanding and empathy. It sucks, but some people don't *have* someone. You and your fianc\u00e9 worked something out and everyone else is getting involved.

They've got hopes and dreams and images of the wedding... I mean, I don't know how many weddings his mom has... but I bet she has dreams of what they look like.\n\nand that matters whether they funded it or not, fwiw...\n\nWeddings should be a celebration of both families coming together and meeting one another\n\nNot a charade marred in trauma that kicks things off on a bad foot. \nWhich isn't to say your pain isn't valid, because it is. \nYour feelings matter. \nYour trauma matters.\n\nbut this is something that could echo throughout your marriage and that's not equal to some embarrassment in my book. \n\nIf there isn't a man, man enough to do your father daughter dance:\n\nHave everyone dance. Hell, do a three-way dance. Or dance alone... fill the space with some karaoke... a distraction.\n\nThis wedding is your chance to create lasting friendships and memories throughout the whole family. There will be people who attend, who you'll meet once and never see again. Better to leave them with a great impression than rumors of why you took a memorable moment out of the ceremony.\n\nEspecially regarding the Mother in Law.

These situations happen all the time because parents are gone or not invited because they suck. This tends to be a very special moment for a mother and a son. It's not about you so you don't have to stress about finding some equivalent dance in order for him to have his. If he's not doing it for you that's his choice.

In your place having lost all meaningful relationships with my biological family, I would work extra hard to build a strong relationship with my husband's family. \n\nYou could choose to be a part of the loving and caring family that he has. Instead you are choosing to inflict your own misery on him. \n\nYour attitude is like - \"if I can't have something, I'll not allow anyone else to have it either\". Don't be a  miserable grinch.

So your MIL did everything right for her child, made all the sacrifices you make as a mum etc but she gets punished because you had a shitty dad?
