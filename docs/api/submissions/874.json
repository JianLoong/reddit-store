He should have paid child support though. Getting money while he\u2019s still alive would be better. Not sure how that works in OP\u2019s region, though.

You didn\u2019t deserve this shit and you def deserve your inheritance. I would not ask him though. I\u2019d have your mom do it bc if he knows what\u2019s coming he might try to hide his assets.

If you want nothing to do with him, leave him alone.", "INFO: have you discussed this with your mom? You\u2019re not an asshole for wanting what you are legally due, but if she spent 16 years not pursuing support, it\u2019s hard to picture her turning on a dime to pursue an acrimonious paternity/estate case.", "NTA. Definitely do it. You have rights as his child and it doesn\u2019t sound like he has supported you much or at all.", "NTA - I hope he paid child support.", "NTA what he did not give in life he shall give in death. \n\nI would say try and get to know your sibling tho.

He probably had a reason (more than likely the law you mentioned) for not doing it, doesn't make it a valid reason however.", "Daddy dearest should have wrapped it then.  If this guy is his bio father, he owes the kid 18 years of child support.  Since he won't do the right thing without the law forcing him, then the kid uses the the law", "I agree with this.

I get that this might come from a place of anger, but seems wrong.", "I have asked my mother if she thinks he would agree to put his name down at my father.

It\u2019s a parent\u2019s duty to support their child.  Both morally and legally in most places.\n\nFrom the sound of it, OP\u2019s father never paid child support.  And local laws require him to give X% to his children in his will.  NOT just the children that are socially acceptable.  OP is his child.\n\nGiven both those things, money is a perfectly acceptable reason to file for paternity.", "Why is it wrong to want his share of inheritance? Dad gave no support at all while he was a child. What is so inherently bad about wanting his share?", "Given that OPs mom could have been forcing him to raise or at least fund his affair baby all along, I think he got off easy just having some money taken after he dies (not like he'd be using it anyway).", "op didn't ask to be born, if his father didn't want a kid he should have used protection or sth, u don't get to choose to \"not be a part\" of the life of someone u brought to this life :/ paying money is the LEAST he should do", "It's not just about that and you know it.", "And legally, it's a child's duty to support their parent financially in their old age.\n\nOP doesn't seem to have looked into every aspect on what it means to be legally his father's child.\n\nThe money thing, it goes both way. If OP dies tomorrow unmarried and childless, his mother is his only heir. If he dies after his father is on the birth certificate, both his parents are his heir.\n\nOP can inherit from his father, which means he can also inherit his debts.\n\nIf the father needs financial support during his retirement, it falls on ALL his children to help him.\n\nI don't think OP understands the difference between being someone's child in society and being legally someone's child.", "I think it's wrong because I think it's bizarre that children are entitled to a share of anything of the parent leaves upon death. By virtue of DNA, that person gains a right to a portion of your property? I think if someone drafts a will, and says \"all my possessions go to my spouse, friend, child etc\" that should be respected.

I understand what you\u2019re trying to say. But we get little information about the situation and half of these are assumptions. What was the agreement between OP\u2019s mom and dad when she got pregnant? Did she want to raise OP alone and have the father not involved or did the father refuse involvement? What happened when they met when OP was a teenager? Did the father contact him or was it a coincidence? Did the father try to be involved and the mother refused or did he want nothing to do with his child?

Given that it seems to apply to every person in his country.\n\nHe probably believes his father has plenty of money to support himself until he dies, since he is thinking of an inheritance. \n\nHe wants no contact with his father or half brother, so I believe he Is looking for a legal father, not a social one.

That makes. Thank you for the information."]}
