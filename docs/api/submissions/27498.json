The idea of her seeing you naked isn't really funny, and it's a bit odd that that is your response when it would probably shock her.

Your brother's reaction is over the top for something that is a big nothing. The teaching moment he should have done is with his child.

Seeing a naked human will scar any kid for life. /s", "Locked the door he said, the door was closed without Keys sorry my english", "I saw a guy peeing on the side of the road when I was in elementary school and it is seared into my memory. When it's the first time seeing something that you don't have, it stands out a lot more. Especially if the adults with you freak out about it. \n\nNTA for the incident though, glad you weren't naked.", "Well, considering children are not as knowledgeable or disciplined as adults, it is strange that assumed a small child could be trusted to consistently knock before entering a room. YTA. \n\nFor future reference, lock the door when you dress if there are small children around. \n\nFor future reference two, I don't know what you think is so funny about a little girl seeing you practically naked. Your brother is right about that being creepy behavior on your part. If you want to seem like a functional adult male, the next time have the common decency to be embarrassed that you didn't lock the door when dressing and apologize rather than try to laugh it off. You're not an impetuous teen anymore, so don't act like one.", "Wtf. It's weird to jump to this being creepy behavior. Throws off more of a red flag about you than OP. He was in his private room partially dressed. It's not that you expect a 6yo to knock, it's that you don't expect a 6yo to be trying to come into your room right at that moment.", "He was wearing boxers. Which cover the same amount as swim trunks. You are weird for calling it creepy.", "This is ridiculous. They're family. It's not in the least bit creepy. He had underwear on, his junk wasn't flopping out. Literally no different at all than being in a pool or at the beach.", "NTA\n\nClearly he didn't teach his daughter boundaries like knocking, that's on him.\n\nAlso, at least you were in boxers, not naked.", "I'd be very offended by him saying it was \"creepy behaviour\" on your part. What the hell is he implying?", "NTA - You made a honest mistake, you should lock your door with 6 years old around, you can't expect 6 year olds to knock and be respectful of your boundaries. Hopefully you learned your lesson.\n\n\nHowever nothing bad really happened, and your brother overreacted.", "My girls are 6 and 8 and are honestly bewildered as to why we need to wear clothes.  They'd go naked all the time when it's warm if we let them.  They spent a lot of their Summers in England with their moms family and Europe just has a much more relaxed attitude towards nudity.  So seeing someone in their shorts is just no big deal.  But it ISN'T your fault your niece just walked in your room.  NTAH.", "I don\u2019t think your TA either way, but just based on the post, I think it\u2019s entirely possible that the six year old reported that she saw you naked, or other language to that effect (\u201cno clothes on\u201d or etc.) which might help explain her dad\u2019s concern level.", "NTA. My kids knew that they should knock on someone else\u2019s bedroom door since they were 3 and they had no issues doing it. Closed door means there is expectation of privacy. Plus seeing an uncle in his underwear is not the end of the world.", "I don't know, this whole situation is weird.  Op's brother's reaction was over the top and, frankly, insulting. If i was op, I'd probably avoid them for a while.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour brother is just trying to blame you for his own lack of teaching manners to his daughter. She saw you in your boxers - hardly traumatic but your brother should have taught his daughter not to just open closed doors before she was six.", "Especially when there is a guest staying with you.", "My uncle didn\u2019t lock the bathroom door and I walked in while he was showering.

Kiddo can learn to knock, and uncle can learn to lock the door.  \n\nJMFC, all his important bits were covered, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.  I'd laugh it off too if someone walked in on me unexpectedly if all the 'naughty' parts were covered.  Let's face it, for the most part, we all have a slight variation on 1 of 2 basic configurations.   The kid has seen more on TV.", "You're a creep for sexualizing the situation. What else goes on in your twisted mind", "Because here in the states we catastrophize seeing a naked person, or a nude statue, or any description of nudity in a book.  Like its wrong or immoral.  And all these bible thumping religious zealots all freaking out about it. But those same people seem to forget that when \"god\" created the world and Adam and Eve, they were naked. It was the \"devil\" that changed the perspective. Not Adam and Eve."]}
