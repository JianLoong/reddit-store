Reading that part of the sentence made my eyes sting. She sounds SO uncaring! Yes, it IS messed up! Couldn't she have said, \"my mother-in-law\"? Does she have a problem with your mother?\n\nYou have every right to be bothered by such a cold and uncaring tone. In this case, you're surely, definitely NTA. For her, I will NOT (for now) say she is TA, for now, I choose to withhold judgment on her.

First of all I\u2019m so sorry about your mom. Second of all, this is a really hard time for you right now, and she should know to be a little more sensitive.

First, grief isn\u2019t a competitive sport.  It can be oddly comforting knowing that most adults will survive the loss of their parents.  But knowing that Tim\u2019s dad just had cancer doesn\u2019t exactly make feel better about my mom who just had a stroke.  Second, confidential news means just that.  Your mom, your news.", "NTA.

And I may be downvoted for that but how your wife has responded to your news outside of this comment matters. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that your mom didn\u2019t want people to know - it was that she didn\u2019t want her children to find out. Your father already overruled that choice. *Why* she didn\u2019t want people to know matters here, because you already knowing may have made other knowing irrelevant.\n\nThere\u2019s also so many other things to consider. Has your wife comforted and supported you? How does she feel about your mother? What has she done to support her sister? Was she close to her BiL?\n\nWithout any context this obviously comes off as cold. But context matters when it comes to coping mechanisms.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the news about your mother.", "NTA.

Did you ask your wife to keep it between you two? Her text does sound harsh and callous but you don\u2019t mention the whole context of the conversation.

A secret between two people only stays that way when one of them is dead, as the saying goes.
