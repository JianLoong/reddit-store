Reading that part of the sentence made my eyes sting. She sounds SO uncaring! Yes, it IS messed up! Couldn't she have said, \"my mother-in-law\"? Does she have a problem with your mother?\n\nYou have every right to be bothered by such a cold and uncaring tone. In this case, you're surely, definitely NTA. For her, I will NOT (for now) say she is TA, for now, I choose to withhold judgment on her. But if I might suggest so, please sit down with her and find out if she's harbouring any hidden resentment towards your mother. Again, I reiterate, you are NTA in this situation.", "NTA, imagine a world where her sisters actually respond \"Why yes in fact your husband's mother also dying does make us feel better, thank you.\" Divorce please?", "NTA. First of all I\u2019m so sorry about your mom. Second of all, this is a really hard time for you right now, and she should know to be a little more sensitive. If she had phrased it differently it wouldn\u2019t have been as bad, but you have a right to be upset about this", "NTA. The way she phrased and told them about it was awful as well", "NTA.  First, grief isn\u2019t a competitive sport.  It can be oddly comforting knowing that most adults will survive the loss of their parents.  But knowing that Tim\u2019s dad just had cancer doesn\u2019t exactly make feel better about my mom who just had a stroke.  Second, confidential news means just that.  Your mom, your news.", "NTA. That was horribly inconsiderate of her.", "You\u2019re never an asshole for your feelings. You become an asshole based on actions regarding those feelings\n\nIt\u2019s ok to be bother d. Feel how you feel bro. Get over it and good luck to your mom.", "As someone who has turned to gallows\nhumor in times of shock I think too much context is missing here to give judgement. And I may be downvoted for that but how your wife has responded to your news outside of this comment matters. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that your mom didn\u2019t want people to know - it was that she didn\u2019t want her children to find out. Your father already overruled that choice. *Why* she didn\u2019t want people to know matters here, because you already knowing may have made other knowing irrelevant.\n\nThere\u2019s also so many other things to consider. Has your wife comforted and supported you? How does she feel about your mother? What has she done to support her sister? Was she close to her BiL?\n\nWithout any context this obviously comes off as cold. But context matters when it comes to coping mechanisms.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the news about your mother.", "NTA. You asked your wife not to tell anyone and she broke your trust. I don't know why she's think someone having cancer would make anyone who recently lost a spouse feel better.", "NTA - what a horrible thing for your wife to say, let alone she wasn't supposed to tell anyone. But that would never make anyone feel better? Your wife needs a crash course on empathy.", "INFO: Did you tell your wife not to tell anyone? Did she know that you and your siblings weren't meant to know?", "Info: you say basically but what did she ACTUALLY say. I doubt it was as cold as that.", "ESH. Did you ask your wife to keep it between you two? Her text does sound harsh and callous but you don\u2019t mention the whole context of the conversation. I feel like it\u2019s easier to be angry with her than to be angry that your mom has cancer. Not judging as it\u2019s hard to watch a parent be sick like this.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. A secret between two people only stays that way when one of them is dead, as the saying goes. Your mother told your father, he told you, you told your wife, she told her sisters.\n\nIs this really the most important issue in your life right now? Don't complicate a difficult situation by blowing this up into nuclear war, you all had a hand in it.", "I guess.. I wonder if you ever told your mother something she didn\u2019t want her to know\u2026???", "Yes and no.... yes because she needs to vent to,  no because she deff could have worded it differently and been more sympathetic!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can also stress that telling multiple ppl was not ok. You can also stress the importance of confidential matters. \n\nDo you not take things out on your wife because you are in fear of losing your mother. I respect your mothers wishes and I understand greatly how much privacy means. It is also inhumane to prohibit somebody by having their own support system when someone in the immediate family has cancer.", "You\u2019re just speaking facts friend.
