I didn't know her well and she wasn't particularly nice. Though I figured no one deserves what was happening to her. So I stopped by S's house and told his wife. She exploded on me and said I was trying to start shit. I left. \n\nLater, I got a group text saying I was exiled from our friend group. Oh well, it sucked but I had a lot going on. I was busy looking for a new job and moving. \n\nA couple years later, S and his wife had a kid. This brought the situation to a head after one of S's cheats also had a baby shortly after.

Ethically, you can either tell him he needs to tell his wife or you will, or end the friendship. I suspect you won't do that either. So you're not an asshole for telling your idiot friend the truth.

I'd bet your friend hides it from his wife, and, if he does, it tells him all he needs to know about whether it's wrong to keep talking to her or not. You don't hide things you're proud of.\n\nWomen can be cruel, especially to other women. Martha was in a long-term relationship when she sent my husband the snap. She only did it to try and regain power over him and cause a rift between us. I guarantee that's what your friend's ex is doing as well. The fact he hasn't blocked her after she did that gives her the exact power she's looking for, and it's concerning on his part because he's essentially letting her have it.

His best friend knew about it and wanted to tell me but also didn\u2019t think it was his place to do so. So, he convinced my ex to tell me himself. He told me the day before our gender reveal party that he had cheated on me 13 times with 5 different women in the 2 years of our relationship and I was absolutely crushed. I called off our wedding (2 weeks before the set wedding date) and started contacting friends and family to explain why. When I told his friend I called off the wedding he said \u201cI\u2019m assuming he told you then?\u201d And of course I questioned what he meant. He told me that he knew about the cheating for almost a month and desperately wanted to tell me but figured it shouldn\u2019t come from him but from my ex himself. He said he had planned to tell me before we got married if my ex hadn\u2019t actually told me. He apologized profusely and I told him I completely understood and that I understood where he was coming from. I probably wouldn\u2019t have believed it if it had come from his friend and would probably still be getting cheated on to this day if he had told me instead of my ex. Sadly, a lot of people don\u2019t believe it until they hear it from their significant other personally. I definitely think that the OP should try his hardest to convince the friend to tell his wife (especially if it\u2019s as innocent as he claims) and if he doesn\u2019t tell her himself, OP should try to get screenshots and send them to the wife anonymously. There is a way this friendship can be saved and the wife know about what\u2019s going on. But honestly, maybe his friend is just genuinely dumb as hell and doesn\u2019t see this as an issue because on his side it\u2019s completely innocent but SHE has ulterior motives that he just can\u2019t seem to see.

It's she was cheating I would talk some sense into her. If he was cheating I would tell her immediately! It's all on the dynamic of the relationship. I would never stop being friends with her for making bad choices", "He began cheating the moment he allowed it to get as far as nudes. And no that's not debatable. Not cutting her off after the nudes, is cheating. No, that's not debatable. \n\nHes also sitting here pretending he's doing it for the wife when the wife is already being made into booboo the fool by this man.

I hate it when they say that. It's for you and your friend because youre fine with the status quo.

So, yes: you are complicit in the betrayal.", "So you'd be ok finding out your s/o has been chatting w/ an ex and also received nudes from said ex? Context matters.

I don\u2019t miss any of my ex\u2019s, if I did they wouldn\u2019t be ex\u2019s. \n\nShe sent nudes on purpose and he still kept taking to her.

Would they appreciate not knowing?", "I think he said he's not necessarily caring about the wife's sake. He's trying to help his friend be better. Part of being better would be blocking his ex who recently sent him a nude, but he still hasn't blocked her yet, so OP is trying to get a better understanding of what's going on in their friend's head so he can help him be better - while also questioning if it's any of his business to try and help guide a friend to make better choices. Everyone is jumping to \"if you cared, you'd let her know and drop your friend\" - I just dont see why relationships aren't worth keeping anymore. He's trying to help his friend because his friend has been tiptoeing around flirting with a years old ex and hasn't seemed to be able to let go of her. I don't understand why people feel the need to immediately drop family and friends, the second they make a mistake or show a hint of poor judgement, just to prove they have a moral code. He wants to help his friend, he doesn't want to ignore his friend's douchey behavior. His friend is clearly important to him, and everyone saying he sucks for not dropping his friend isn't helping him solve his problem.\nIf my best friend of 25 years (I'm 31) started flirting with the idea of cheating on a partner, I wouldn't immediately drop her just because she let the idea enter her mind. I'd try to help her work through those emotions and figure out why she's not happy in her relationship. She's essentially my sister, and no one could tell me to drop her, but a lot of people would consider me an AH for not dropping her, which I find silly.", "[removed]", "I just don't understand how you can see someone defile what is supposed to be like the most important relationship a person can have and then believe they still would value your relationship", "It used to be infuriating seeing people act like this on this sub but at this point its just funny.
