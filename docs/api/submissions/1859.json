{"id": 1859, "submission_id": "yq3usa", "title": "AITA for dismissing my disabled sister while she was crying?", "selftext": "My sister, 18F, has Cerebral Palsy that affects the usage of her right hand and leg. She was extremely lucky to have a more subtle case of Cerebral Palsy, but it still sometimes gets in the way of her lifestyle. She has completely given up getting any help with her disability after she got surgery to fix her way of walking.\n\nMy sister is bipolar and is extremely sensitive. She gets easily overwhelmed and dramatizes any small issue. I've gotten used to this behavior, as it has been going on for many years. However, there are just some times that I cant deal with it anymore.\n\nToday was the exception. My sister had microwaved a Pot Pie, and as she took it out, she dropped it. Usually this never happens - in my opinion, I believe she got scared it was hot and accidentally slipped. She started swearing, then panicked for paper towels. We didn't have many, so she was frantically searching, occasionally yelling at our dogs, and physically pushing them to get out of her way. Then she started crying and complaining. I kept telling her to take a breather, since it wasn't that big of a deal. I even went out of my way to clean the very small mess.\n\nNow this happens a lot, she gets so overwhelmed, starts crying, and repeating herself constantly saying how no one will ever understand what she is going through. Which is true, you can\u2019t ever experience what someone else is experiencing. She practically made her life seem like its one big giant charity case - when really, she just refuses to find different solutions to her problems.\n\nAfter hearing her complain repeatedly, crying hysterically, comparing her physical abilities to myself constantly, I got fed up. I told her to stop crying over little things, because she wont get very far in life. She even cries when I don't help her take three grocery bags out of the car, because she can\u2019t get up (due to her weight imo) since she cant use *one* hand. There have been multiple times where I went out of my way to prove to her that I can do things with one hand that she could have done. Her disability only really limits her one hand, she can still use it, but she doesn't have much strength. She unfortunately uses her Cerebral Palsy as an excuse for everything.\n\nShe said that I invalidated her feelings because I told her to be quiet and chill out. I also told her that she shouldn't let these small mishaps get in the way of her life, because then she'd need to be babied for the rest of her life. I may have let my own emotions get in the way, because I slipped and said that it\u2019s tiring always hearing her complain about her life, and her using her disability as an excuse for everything. She needs to learn to suck it up and find workarounds for the most challenging bits of having Cerebral Palsy. I feel guilty for being mean, but I can\u2019t help but feel annoyed. I'm tired of being compared to her disability all the time. I got vocal about how I was feeling now, and she took it the wrong way.\n\nAITA for speaking up?\n\n<edit: I apologized\u2026 she assumed i was going say more insulting things and she got up in my face. in the end, she apologized too and i think we\u2019re okay. for now.>", "created_utc": 1667954746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq3usa/aita_for_dismissing_my_disabled_sister_while_she/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's why she's constantly comparing her struggles with your abilities, and having meltdowns.  You're absolutely right in everything you said to her, and your feelings of frustration are valid, However your outburst probably just validated her need to feel like the victim. \n\n Like you said, there's no doubt that she has struggles -- mental and physical -- that you can't understand.  In the end, you hate seeing her feel upset because you know she's more capable and that hurts to watch.  Next time wait until neither of you is emotional (like in the middle of struggling with groceries, or a dropped chicken pot pie) and sit her down and talk to her about how you're feeling, and how you want her to succeed.   And listen to her and validate her feelings too.  Good luck!", "NAH, I see where your coming from and I get that your overwhelmed with her behavior. But she can't control how she is most of the time im assuming so just try to be more mindful, and tell her nicely (if u didnt).", "NAH: she may not realize the bipolar disorder is actually effecting her life this much.\n\nimo its not only her cerebral palsy doing this, but her mental status too. being unstable with emotions means that things CAN flip flop that easy and its draining as FUCK to go from having a perfectly normal day to having a breakdown over something stupid.\n\ni'm on bipolar medication. it helps with the sensitivity n crying outbursts. it may help her, too.", "Sounds like you\u2019re burnt out, are you your sisters only caregiver?

But the truth is that everyone has to work through adversity, some more than others, but giving up/complaining constantly will not help.", "NTA.

You will never understand her, she is right. But instead of telling these things with harsh words when she is already stressed, overwhelmed and in the middle of a crisis, you can be more gentle, like the pie situation, you can say: \"hey, no problem, I can help you\" and offer her calm instructions but not taking actions unless she asks your help for it: \"Take a trash bag, now throw the pie that fell in the bag, let's take some napkins, blablaba\"...", "YTA, your sister has a life changing disability, that takes a toll on mental health.

She's playing life on hard mode, and while I understand that this is stressful for you as well (being the sibling or child of someone disabled is also difficult), she's got it harder.

You were criticizing her and that hurt.  Separate and apart from that, the good thing is you'd like to see your sister become more independent and self-reliant emotionally. Mental illness is tricky. If she's depressed then everything becomes incredibly hard to do. She probably needs professional help to learn how to cope with challenging situations. She may simply not be able to hear it from you. If she's been shit-talking herself for years then it's no surprise she blames everything, even a small kitchen accident, on her condition. That's a hard cycle to get out of. She may not take the suggestion of getting help to better regulate her emotions well but it's likely the best thing you can do in this situation.

It's frustrating. NTA", "NTA. That your sister has a disability cannot be discounted, but from what you've explained here you did everything you could reasonably be expected to in order to support her in this situation. By my reckoning, you tried to coach her through calming down and recognizing that, while frustrating, the situation was hardly a monumental disaster and then helped her clean up the mess when she was unable to calm herself. That she wanted to continue having a meltdown about the situation leads me to suspect that she is content to allow her disability to define her and wishes to use it to garner sympathy and attention, likely as a learned behavior due to getting similar results historically from a parent/guadian.\n\nIt sounds to me like she could use some kind of counseling in order to help her develop strategies for overcoming her limitations and coping with mishaps in order to empower her to live a successful and independent adult life.", "YTA - I understand your stress over this but try to understand, for her its really hard to not be able to do certain things", "ESH but the real help would be therapy together to work on your relationship, and separately to work on your coping strategies.

I feel incredibly guilty and disgusted by the way I acted, and I made an effort to apologize - things are slowly going back to normal. My sister had gone to therapy, but now refuses to go back because she doesn't think it helps her any. I had gone to therapy as well, but stopped because my therapist didn't help much. I feel for those who have disabilities, it really does suck that they cant change anything about it. It pains me that I sometimes can be this way, selfish i mean, as all I want in life is perfection, although that's completely unrealistic. I sincerely apologize if I was coming off as ableist. I guess sometimes I get burnt out of just listening, that I just rather be unbothered, which could really be detrimental to my sister and I's relationship. Thank you kindly for this post, I appreciate your words."]}
