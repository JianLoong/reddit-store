It is very normal and expected as a couple to celebrate \"wins\" like a promotion together. You made a slightly condescending decision that your bf wouldn't be able to handle you having a win, which speaks poorly for how you see him overall. I understand that you just didn't want him to be hurt, but it's sad to expect that you finding success in your career is going to hurt him. Hiding your promotion was somewhat paternalistic and not very good communication. I'd apologize and try to work on being more open.", "Very soft YTA.\n\nFeeling sorry for his work situation isn\u2019t a good reason not to share this, despite good intentions. If he\u2019s a good partner then he\u2019d be happy about your achievements (which he was), you don\u2019t need to hide this, and going forward how long were you planning on keeping it from him? When you moved in together? When you get married? This could\u2019ve very easily spiralled into a big thing and felt like a much bigger lie. I can see why he\u2019d be a bit off, it implies that you don\u2019t think he\u2019d support you in your achievements and that\u2019s he\u2019s selfish enough to make them about him, not saying that is how you feel, but it\u2019s certainly how it looks. Also, if you explained to reason for not wanting to tell him it implies pity, which isn\u2019t going to make him feel any better.", "INFO: to me it depends on how serious you guys are. If serious, then yes, very weird and AH move to not share. If not, meh, who cares.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYour intentions were nice, but probably unnecessary. Where you went wrong was in hiding it - it should be something you're proud of. Now he's probably wondering what else you might be hiding.", "NAH/very soft YTA because your overall intentions weren't malicious.\n\nHowever, you don't keep things like this from your partner. He's right. You're supposed to share your wins. A mature adult can be excited despite not being in as good of a position as you. Unless you don't trust that he can handle it? I'd feel a little insulted at the insinuations of that. I think you just need to apologize for this very minor infraction and go celebrate your promotion.", "Yeah, YTA.  \n\nThe amount of confusion and doubt he's probably feeling is pretty sad.", "I am kind of on your boyfriends side on this one. \nNot that you had to share your salary with him.  I agree though that in a relationship you should share your wins. \nWhat is the point of having a partner if not to have someone to share happiness with? \nI could see how from his perspective you not feeling like you can trust him or not being as close as he might have assumed you were. \n\nThis could be a gray area in communication. \nIf you are in a committed relationship what amount of information is too much or too little. \nYou could use this as an example to clarify some of those unknowns in your relationship.", "\u201cHe felt like I was hiding it from him.\u201d You were, even if you think your reasons were valid.", "YTA not because you didn't share the information but for the reason why you decided not to tell him.\n He didn't feel  bad because you made more money than him.", "Soft YTA.\n\n>He said it was \"weird\" I didn\u2019t tell him when we're supposed to share our \"wins\" with each other as a couple\n\nI agree with this but you\u2019re not a major AH because I think you overthink things a bit.

Doesn\u2019t really sound like you view him as a partner.", "I don't think your intentions were bad seeing as how he could have taken it the wrong way. I could also see where he was coming from wanting to share this win with you and being confused as to why it was hidden. Without knowing if you were going to tell at all or when you were going to, I cant say if you are or not.", "YTA best of intentions but the wrong thing to do to hide it.", "YTA\n\nDon't hide your light to try to make someone else's look brighter.

Did you ever think he would just be happy for you if you told him?  You need to communicate with your bf about your feelings better.", "NAH - I feel like what you were trying to do was just and understandable, and it sounds like you have a good appreciation for the work that he does. Just take it as a learning opportunity to be more honest with him in the future.", "YTA, why didn't you tell him?", "YTA\n\nHe wants to know because it's important to the two of you.

It seems like she's embarrassed she's got a really good thing going on and is trying not to rub bf's face in it.\n\nBf is making that unnecessary by considering her happiness as his happiness, which is a healthy and sensible thing to do. If bf was a more jealous or fragile person it might have been necessary to hide the promotion from him. \n\nIt feels like you're both trying to make sure you don't upset or seem uncaring about the other. I can't sensibly say anyone is being an asshole here, it's just something you could probably have an adult conversation about, explain how you feel about your job being super cushy and how you didn't want to rub it in his face if it would have upset him.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think you hid it with bad intentions but I can see why he was put off.. just explain to him how you feel and make sure moving forward there is always a line of open communication.", "He's your partner, and this is one of the things you should be sharing with him.

So own it and apologize to him. \n\nSoft YTA", "YTA\n\nthats a weird thing to keep from your boyfriend. if you are that worried about him working too much you could always pay for his stuff etc.", "NTA - But I think you should evaluate why you felt like you couldn't tell him. I think it's an orange flag.", "NTA But has he showed behavior that you need to tiptoe around this kind of stuff? Typically as others have said you should be able to share wins.", "We don't live together or share finances, but I see us getting married in the future, yes. \n\nI don't think my motive was trust-related: I trust him, but from what I gather from other people's comments, I was projecting my feelings onto my boyfriend. But now that I think about it, there is a bit of a fear that he could \"switch up\" after knowing the salary increase. He hasn't given any indication that he will, but also people can surprise you? But that also may be me overthinking again.", "You know, I don't know why I conflated telling him the promotion with telling him the amount. I guess because if I had told my parents, they would hound me for the exact money amount, and I'm so used to that type of response.", "It MAY have been the wrong choice.  \u201cWins\u201d may encompass \u201cwinnings.\u201d", "Nope that doesn't explain why anyone should share this", "NTA - Its none of his business.  Do your job.  Go home.  Of a promotion comes up so be it.  Keep doing what you are doing and fuck whateverybody says.  Some people get off on recognition and broadcasting it to everybody.  You cant go wrong with doing your job.", "Info- is there a reason you didn\u2019t tell him? Didn\u2019t want him to feel bad? Not sure of his reaction? How it may affect relationship?", "NTA you wrote you got the info about the promotion yesterday. It\u2019s not as if you have hidden the fact for weeks or months. Be happy that you have a good job you like and that gives you the possibility to live good and save money.", "YTA. Its a promotion,. Being a couple means sharing the good and the bad. Youve chosen to not share.", "YTA. For lying and keeping things from your BF. Stop walking on eggshells. He is an adult and he should be able to handle his GF making more money than him. If he can't then he needs to get over himself. He is the one who chose his career path. If he wanted to he could have gone to college and gotten a job that wasn't physically demanding. He should change career paths.", "It may be sad to expect that OP has concerns about bf finding out, but it has a real-world basis [https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/08/men-self-esteem](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/08/men-self-esteem)", "That seems weirdly coincidental. The mail was received the day before, and it was still open, and the page was the one she was on while bf was here ? So between the moment the mail was received and the moment bf came, she didn't do anything on the laptop ?", "Well basically for the exact reasons your boyfriend gave you. So now it's a bit extra odd that you both decided how he would feel about your promotion without talking to him about it, and then disregarded what he's telling you he feels now. This is not the biggest relationship sin ever committed, but definitely seems indicative of pretty major communication issues...", "I think you need to spend a lot less time judging and bashing others with high doses of condescension and judgement and look in the mirror instead.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with you not sharing what you don\u2019t want to share, however it may make him question how you view him as you didn\u2019t want to share this happy news.", "YTA but it\u2019s also understandable. You let your insecurity get the better of you. Better come clean to him about that insecurity if you haven\u2019t already, before he starts imagining reasons why you didn\u2019t say anything, like wanting to keep the money secret.", "i\u2019m gonna say NAH.  your intentions were to prevent possibly hurting his feelings, so you\u2019re not an AH.  He didn\u2019t know this and was understandably confused, so he\u2019s not an AH either.", "YTA, but in a misguided way instead of malicious.\n\nWhat\u2019s probably hurting most for him is that you assumed how he would react and judged him on it. You didn\u2019t give him the chance to show you his reaction. If he was upset, then you two could have dealt with the issue. But you took that away from him. My husband used to do this to me. He would never bring a potential problem to me because of the possibility that I might be angry. And then in his head I WAS angry and he resented me for it. I never had the chance to react one way or the other but was still resented over his decision.\n\nYour bf is upset because you assumed he would react negatively and thus judged him and took away his agency in it. It\u2019s a mistake you can learn from and have a better relationship because of it. Apologize for your assumptions, admit it was silly and hurtful to think that way about him, talk it out and move forward. He sounds like a good guy who is really behind you and wants to celebrate your success.", "NTA, it your money and raise, your job, your own bank account and he\u2019s your boyfriend (not husband) and you don\u2019t live together, so your not sharing expenses. So basically all that adds up is it\u2019s your own business and if you don\u2019t want to share that with him then it\u2019s totally your call. The fact that he\u2019s checking out (snooping) on your computer when it\u2019s open is more concerning.", "None of this business", "If I was your boyfriend I\u2019d be the most hurt that you think I\u2019m the kind of person to get upset when something good happens to my partner.\n\nDo you not think much of him?", "i have a habit of re-opening emails, sometimes ones like this when i\u2019m excited", ">Plus she assumed he would be upset about her getting a promotion, so assumed the worst of him. That's a valid thing to be upset about.\n\nThis is the answer right here.  How crappy.\n\nOP thought good news for her would make her boyfriend feel \"bad\".  WTF.  Why is she even with someone she thinks can't be happy for her.", "What a dumb comment", "Well, you should've told him, OP. However, you didn't do anything garbage-human level wrong, and your bf is just thinking why didn't you tell him. He's right here, you should share your wins, but also your losses. You seem reasonable and honest enough that it shouldn't come across as gloating or insulting, just tell him how you really feel. He'll trust you way more for that.\n\nNAH.", "As a contractor our ego isn\u2019t as fragile as you think. Maybe give the guy the benefit of the doubt. YTA", "I'm going to say NAH because the promotion was JUST confirmed and it probably would have come up eventually, you also don't live together and (presumably) don't share finances. He's never told you what he makes so if this is an incremental promotion that's really about the pay raise it's not too weird... But he has a good point that it's odd that you wouldn't want to share your good news and your attitude about making more money than him seems like a sign of an underlying problem.", "I'm going to abstain cuz i can see it from alot of angles and i don't think we have all the info here. \n\nIs this an issue u have had? Has he seemed sensitiive to those things in the past?\n\nOr maybe it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with how the men in your life would have reacted? \n\nCuz finacally not being the provider in a relationship is a big issues for a lot of men and that is commen knowledge. Was it just that or more specific to op's life. \n\nI could see watching your parents fight about soemthing simaler and thier own father reacting bad to it influencing how they would react. \n\nThere are a lot of factors in this that aren't being considered.", "YTA for hiding it, but he is the AH for snooping on your laptop..", "Of course she gets to decide what information she shares about herself, just as he is free to judge her for it. She was misguided and that makes her the AH in this situation.", "I know I would feel bad if my husband did not share the news of his promotions, just as he would if I didn't share mine. The post doesn't indicate that he acts like a leech or anything about your money. You say he just feels sad that you didn't share a good news with him. Why do you think he will \"feel bad\" on knowing about your promotion? Maybe you should try thinking about it. This is a matter of mutual trust.", ">But now that I think about it, there is a bit of a fear that he could \"switch up\" after knowing the salary increase.\n\nEven if he did, wouldn't this be information that would be useful to you? Especially if you see this as a longterm relationship vs. a fling."]}
