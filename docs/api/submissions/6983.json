It is very normal and expected as a couple to celebrate \"wins\" like a promotion together. You made a slightly condescending decision that your bf wouldn't be able to handle you having a win, which speaks poorly for how you see him overall. I understand that you just didn't want him to be hurt, but it's sad to expect that you finding success in your career is going to hurt him. Hiding your promotion was somewhat paternalistic and not very good communication. I'd apologize and try to work on being more open.", "Very soft YTA.\n\nFeeling sorry for his work situation isn\u2019t a good reason not to share this, despite good intentions. If he\u2019s a good partner then he\u2019d be happy about your achievements (which he was), you don\u2019t need to hide this, and going forward how long were you planning on keeping it from him? When you moved in together? When you get married? This could\u2019ve very easily spiralled into a big thing and felt like a much bigger lie. I can see why he\u2019d be a bit off, it implies that you don\u2019t think he\u2019d support you in your achievements and that\u2019s he\u2019s selfish enough to make them about him, not saying that is how you feel, but it\u2019s certainly how it looks. Also, if you explained to reason for not wanting to tell him it implies pity, which isn\u2019t going to make him feel any better.", "INFO: to me it depends on how serious you guys are. If serious, then yes, very weird and AH move to not share. If not, meh, who cares.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYour intentions were nice, but probably unnecessary. Where you went wrong was in hiding it - it should be something you're proud of. Now he's probably wondering what else you might be hiding.", "NAH/very soft YTA because your overall intentions weren't malicious.\n\nHowever, you don't keep things like this from your partner. He's right. You're supposed to share your wins. A mature adult can be excited despite not being in as good of a position as you. Unless you don't trust that he can handle it? I'd feel a little insulted at the insinuations of that. I think you just need to apologize for this very minor infraction and go celebrate your promotion.", "Yeah, YTA.  \n\nThe amount of confusion and doubt he's probably feeling is pretty sad.", "I am kind of on your boyfriends side on this one. \nNot that you had to share your salary with him.  I agree though that in a relationship you should share your wins. \nWhat is the point of having a partner if not to have someone to share happiness with? \nI could see how from his perspective you not feeling like you can trust him or not being as close as he might have assumed you were. \n\nThis could be a gray area in communication. \nIf you are in a committed relationship what amount of information is too much or too little. \nYou could use this as an example to clarify some of those unknowns in your relationship.", "\u201cHe felt like I was hiding it from him.\u201d You were, even if you think your reasons were valid.", "YTA not because you didn't share the information but for the reason why you decided not to tell him.\n He didn't feel  bad because you made more money than him.", "Soft YTA.\n\n>He said it was \"weird\" I didn\u2019t tell him when we're supposed to share our \"wins\" with each other as a couple\n\nI agree with this but you\u2019re not a major AH because I think you overthink things a bit.

Doesn\u2019t really sound like you view him as a partner.", "I don't think your intentions were bad seeing as how he could have taken it the wrong way. I could also see where he was coming from wanting to share this win with you and being confused as to why it was hidden. Without knowing if you were going to tell at all or when you were going to, I cant say if you are or not.", "YTA best of intentions but the wrong thing to do to hide it.", "YTA\n\nDon't hide your light to try to make someone else's look brighter.

Did you ever think he would just be happy for you if you told him?  You need to communicate with your bf about your feelings better.", "NAH - I feel like what you were trying to do was just and understandable, and it sounds like you have a good appreciation for the work that he does. Just take it as a learning opportunity to be more honest with him in the future.", "YTA, why didn't you tell him?", "YTA\n\nHe wants to know because it's important to the two of you.

It seems like she's embarrassed she's got a really good thing going on and is trying not to rub bf's face in it.\n\nBf is making that unnecessary by considering her happiness as his happiness, which is a healthy and sensible thing to do. If bf was a more jealous or fragile person it might have been necessary to hide the promotion from him. \n\nIt feels like you're both trying to make sure you don't upset or seem uncaring about the other. I can't sensibly say anyone is being an asshole here, it's just something you could probably have an adult conversation about, explain how you feel about your job being super cushy and how you didn't want to rub it in his face if it would have upset him.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think you hid it with bad intentions but I can see why he was put off.. just explain to him how you feel and make sure moving forward there is always a line of open communication.", "He's your partner, and this is one of the things you should be sharing with him.

You have to let him react to these kinds of things. otherwise you\u2019re making decisions on everything based on your thoughts without giving him a real chance. If he\u2019s insecure, at least you\u2019ll know for real. And best not to start building a situation where you have to hide new things because of what you haven\u2019t told him already.

Even if that's not what you do think of him, that's the message - you don't trust him to be happy for you. 2) You inadvertently send the message that maybe you don't think much of his profession, by having the urge to downplay your own because he might feel bad. He'd only feel bad if his job were somehow lesser. I am not saying you believe any of those things, but it can FEEL like it to someone on the other end of this. It's not your job to manage his emotions about stuff and when you try you risk getting it very wrong and/or causing resentment in your effort to avoid resentment!", "This is a very healthy approach.", "It's also, like, you're hiding money from him? Even if you don't share finances, that kind of thing is big. That changes how you save together, and what he can reasonably expect for your future together. Suddenly, you have a significant amount of money he just doesn't know about, and presumably never would until a moment like this, where he found out on accident.", "NTA.  I\u2019m in a similar situation and I make about triple of what my boyfriend makes.  He doesn\u2019t know the exact amount because I won\u2019t give the info to him.  When it comes to finances, especially when women are making more, you have to tread lightly.  For the \u201cYTA\u201d there are double the amount of posts on the sub about women \u201csharing their win\u201d and getting shamed/stuck with bills/ resented/ etc.", "soft YTA only because intentions seemed to protect bf and not degrade bf.  If he's the real package he will be happy for you regardless the differences of jobs.  You got a naturally be placed in these situations to see how you both react to things to know if it's worth getting serious or not.  There's times to protect each other but this was not one of those things to protect partner from.", "YTA. It\u2019s really weird to hold information of something that is good. You should expect him to be happy for you when he hears the news. If not, then why he with someone who isn\u2019t happy for you?", "Soft YTA... not all guys are insecure about themselves and their jobs.  Your bf sounds like a good guy... happy for your success.  Which is the way it should be!\n\nMy wife does far better than me, and I have to work harder (I'm a college instructor, she's an interpretor... and does very well) and I am always immensely proud of her and her success.  We share our wins.  We're happy for each other... not jealous.", "He's slightly an ass for reading your email.", "YTA\n\nThat's not yow you treat somebody you *want* to be in a relationship with, and it's short-sighted anyway. If this is a significant pay jump for you, are you simply going to completely hide the new income from him?", "YTA. While you try to be empathetic, your entire post reeks of condescension.\n\nMethinks a PALTRY salary went to your head.", "How long have you guys been dating? If it\u2019s been a while YTA. It\u2019s crazy how many people do not communicate with the people in their life. Sharing that win for you could have also been a time to talk about your concerns regarding his overall well-being in his job. And if you\u2019re wanting to spend your future with him at some point you\u2019re going to have to have a talk about finances.", "Stop feeling bad, you worked hard to get a good job. Not every job has to be back breaking to make a lot of money. Paid in skills, not achey body. Stop diminishing yourself for others, you are talented and yes lucky. You can fix this by being honest with him like you are on here in your post.", "He has a point. NAH really. Just you trying to spare his feelings, which in the end, hurt his feelings. It sounds like he would rather you be honest in the future and he wants to celebrate good things with you- so in the future, I wouldn't try to spare his feelings when it comes to money and promotions.", "INFO:\n\nWhy didn't you tell him?  And don't repeat:\n\n> I decided not to tell my boyfriend because I didn't want him to feel bad.", "YTA.   Keeping secrets is a great way to make a relationship toxic. You had no reason to keep this from your boyfriend, he is going to be wondering what the problem in your relationship is", "NTA. He is a boyfriend and not a husband.\n \nHowever, you will be an AH if you continue to compare yourself to him and worry about how he will react to your success. \n\nSide note: your job most likely seems easy because you are very good at what you do, and it comes naturally to you.  DoNT downplay your success!", "No one lies about just one thing. You hid the truth. Now he has to wonder what else you\u2019re hiding. \n\nThe fact that you think he\u2019s too fragile to be happy for you is a problem. Your plan to hide your promotion forever is a much bigger issue. It speaks to who you are in a relationship.  If he opts out, I can\u2019t say I blame him.", "YTA but like soft, I feel you're trying to protect his \"ego\" because men are stereotyped to have that but it seems he was fine celebrating your win and if it was just him feeling bad cause you hid it I think those are valid feelings. Has your boyfriend ever shown signs that he's jealous of you?", "As someone who could be guilty of doing the same, has anyone in your life made you feel bad about accomplishments, OP? My mom is like this, and though I know she doesn't mean it the way it comes across, the sting is still there. \n\n\"You always have good things happen to you.\"\n\n\"You live such a charmed life.\"\n\n\"You don't know how it feels, nothing bad ever happens to you.\"\n\nHear these things enough times, for enough years, and you learn to downplay your accomplishments, even though you don't want to. You feel guilty for doing better, and even though they tell you they want you to succeed, on the back of things like this, which do you believe? Which should you?\n\nI'm not gonna pass judgment, everyone else already has, but I thought I'd offer some perspective as to where this behavior might come from.", "Nta. Time to upgrade the boyfriend too.", "Maybe, but she also could have been somewhat maternalistically motivated.  Maybe she had communicated with him and the past and reasonably expected him to be upset.  IDK.", "[removed]", "> Your intentions were nice\n\nHow?  Her intent was to deceive somebody she ostensibly loves and considers something of a partner.  How is that intent 'nice?'", "/u/Diferfvhmv is a bot that stole part of a comment from /u/BeeHonest94 here /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108cflk/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_i_got_a/j3rc31x/", "Hello Mr. Bot. You stole this comment from u/Chavante83, who posted the original roughly two hours before this one. You have been downvoted and reported as Spam \u2014> Harmful Bots.", "You treated him like he\u2019s one of the following: too fragile to handle this information, a sexist who is threatened by a woman who may be more successful than he is, and/or like he\u2019s one of those people who reacts to other\u2019s successes with immature jealousy. He probably is wondering whether or not you trust him and what other personal information you don\u2019t think he\u2019s worthy of sharing.  You\u2019ve really underestimated him and he knows it.\n\nDo you have a history of people reacting badly to good news?", "She did it because she thought he'd be upset because he's underpaid at his job. It was clearly the wrong choice but she was trying to spare his feelings.", "They aren't married and don't even live together, so they are not \"saving together\". The post doesn't say how long they've been together. I do understand why their partner was uncomfortable that they didn't share the \"win\" but I don't think her finances should necessarily be the partners concern."]}
