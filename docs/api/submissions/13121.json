I know that's partly because of everything that going on at the time but I genuinely do feel bad for losing my temper with my husband.\n\nIn December last year my elderly mother who was suffering with dementia, had a massive heart attack.  Prior to this I was near enough her full time carer as well as working full time (thankfully from home and with flexible management) I sorted her benefits, doctors appointments, took her food, cleaned and dealt with 20 to 30 phone calls a day. \n\nShe then had the heart attack.  I was able to take leave from work and was there for 16 to 18 hours a day, she wasn't coming home but they couldn't say how long.  For the first few days there was food at home that I could just throw in the microwave or I had some toast when I got in but I did have to ask my husband to go and get groceries as we were running so low.  I got home on the night in question and there was literally nothing I could just heat up. He'd gotten pizza for himself and our son but no other ready meals or anything I could have quickly. I was so tired and disappointed that he didn't even think to get me a bloody frozen pizza. I sat in the kitchen and cried.\n\nHe said he didn't get me anything because he didn't know what time I'd be home.  I said it didn't matter what time I got home  I'd still need to eat. I gave him such a scolding.\n\nI didn't speak to him for a couple of days, not that I was home a lot anyway but he gave me a half assed apology so I put it to one side and tried to forget about it.\n\nWe buried mum on Christmas eve. It still annoys me that he couldn't even think 'she'll need to eat' and get me some microwave meals, I just felt so unsupported through the worst time of my life.", "created_utc": 1679691779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120yl2z/aita_husband_didnt_leave_me_a_dinner/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You asked him to get groceries. He couldn't cook for himself and the kid, so he got pizza. Fine, but he \ndidn't even leave one slice for his wife? His wife who was doing all of the above and still cooking dinner for her husband and child?\n\nNot a single thing she could throw in the microwave tells me when he went shopping he still expected her to be the one making the food. Unbelievable.\n\nListen, did he have to make her dinner? No, but plenty of women have \"not known\" what time their spouse would be home and kept a plate in the fridge. \n\nMy feelings would have been beyond hurt.  I would be tired of being a mom of two.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nYour husband failed to get groceries or think of you when getting food for himself and your child. That was incredibly inconsiderate. \n\nI don't know if it was worth a 3-day silent treatment when he could have been supportive (after being reminded what he needed to do), but he's still the one in the wrong here.", "NTA. You were depleted and unsupported by the one person who is supposed to have your back.", "NTA and the fact you're still upset about it makes me think he is still being selfish. I couldn't imagine not having any kind of food for my partner to eat after I fed myself with pizza", "NTA. You were going through and extraordinarily rough time and your husband couldn't even be bothered to get you something to eat.", "You are definitely NTA.  I am very sorry for your loss and the stress you've been under. He's supposed to be a support for you and most certainly dropped the ball here.", "NTA", "NTA but I don\u2019t see how else could I vote. Losing your temper for something like that was the least you could do.", "NTA\n\n\nIn my opinion he fucked up. I don't think this one thing makes him evil or even nessarily lazy. I don't know how he is the rest of the time.", "NTA. He owes you an apology. And several months of cooking and doing the dishes. Pizza does not grow on trees.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re married to such an inconsiderate A-H \ud83d\ude1e Please accept my heartfelt condolences on the loss of your mum. Sending plenty of love, strength and comfort your way, OP.", "NTA. It\u2019s so unfair to have a partner who is selfish and inconsiderate like this. It happens a lot though, because people who do think of others and try to take care of them often attract the opposite.", "NAH.  Imo not knowing when you'd be back or if you'd have eaten makes sense.  Also, this is one of the few times it makes sense to order in.  You say he and your son had eaten so it sounds like he was parenting while you were caretaking. I've done both and making sure the kid eats tends to overshadow a lot of other stuff.  Ofc, I don't know if there is a dynamic or pattern of behavior in your relationship that this plays into but I will say this;  caretaking is Hard and it is easy to move emotions over to \"safe\" places sometimes, as opposed to confronting their actual source head-on.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nI was with my ex (who was a horribly shit person in many ways) when my dad was dealing with stage 4 graft vs host disease, then dying of sepsis. My mom and I were his main caregivers when he wasn't hospitalized. For almost 2 years, my life was dad/work/sleep probably 75% of the time.\n\nMy ex and I agreed from the beginning that due to health reasons, I was never allowed to go to bed without dinner. For his many faults, my ex always made sure I ate something before I went to sleep, even if it was just a peanut butter sandwich. Him taking care of me in that small way lightened my load infinitely, and I have a feeling that's more what your hurt is about. It isn't the food, it's about the perceived lack of care.", "So has his behavior improved since then or is he still kinda like this?", "I'm sorry about your mom. I understand where you're coming from however you were wrong IMO. I spent half of last year being my mamas full time caregiver. We lived a half hour away and have 6 kids. My husband stepped up doing EVERYTHING for our home/family plus work. By the end we were staying at a friend's 2 blocks away because mom's time was up. There were a couple times he didn't leave me dinner but that's life. My kids were fed and family cared for. I was doing very minimal with our family and he was doing it all. One night he didn't have dinner and you didn't have instant food. What about the other nights? Was your son fed? Did he have to do more because you were (understandably) gone all the time? Did you thank him for everything in the end? This didn't just affect you. Again I understand you were stressed and still hurting but to \"fine him such a scolding\" and to still be hung up on it is beyond ridiculous IMO (I wouldn't call you an A H but close).", "NAH\n\nNo one is perfect every day.\n\nIt's unfortunate he didn't consider that you'd be hungry, or realize there was nothing else, but he's not TA for his oversight. \n\nYou are allowed to be upset in the moment and it was probably just the sum of your emotions....but it's not fair to extrapolate that he was not supportive during this time bc he was not perfect at it every day.", "Info: Was your husband on the same page with you for all the time you were giving to care for your mom? I ask because I\u2019m wondering if his behavior was the result of some resentment for picking up all the slack at home during this time. Not that it justifies his behavior, nor am I implying your choice to care for your mom was wrong. Just trying to get more info before making a judgement!", "NTA. He sounds like a selfish man that doesn't care about you at all. And he certainly doesn't care about your son if he is feeding him pizza instead of something healthy. Based on his behavior, I'm going to assume that the pizza wasn't even vegan so there's that as well. You should really consider moving on in your life, for the sake of your mental well-being and that of your son. Good luck and be safe.", "This is one of the times the name of this sub makes this hard, because you\u2019re definitely not an Asshole but you were also in the wrong in that particular situation. The fact you were stressed and upset is understandable, and you reacting that way is easy to understand, but it was still unfair that it seems you blew up at your husband because of piled up stress rather than anything he\u2019d done wrong. Does that make any sense?", "NAH. I think you are displacing your grief into anger. Try to just move on. Good luck, sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nYou aren\u2019t an asshole for being stressed during what was no doubt an incredibly hard time.\n\nBut no one is ever an asshole for not being a mind reader.", " NTA. Your feelings are understandable, but it is time to let it go.", "Nta. So very sorry for your loss, you sound like an amazing daughter. I hope it was very out of the ordinary for your husband to be so unbelievably inconsiderate", "Hang on I\u2019m confused what does it being vegan have to do with the post? Unless I read it wrong..", "You think the husband feeding himself and the kid with pizza and not leaving some for the wife is doing nothing wrong?   Considerate humans can anticipate their spouse will need a meal and make sure there is something available.  Yesh.  That\u2019s not expecting too much.", "OP specifically asked spouse to get groceries - but there was still no food in the house - spouse just ordered pizza for himself and son and didn't even think about OP and the stress she was going through. Spouse is definitely AH and deserved to be yelled at.", "O.o... asking your partner to buy groceries and comming home to not being able to eat is not misplaced anger.", "It doesn\u2019t take a mind reader to anticipate your spouse needs food.", "She asked him to get groceries and he couldn't even get the same stuff they had in the house previously. At what point did she ask him to read her mind?", "She asked him to buy groceries since there was no food in the house. It doesn\u2019t require any telepathy to understand what that means.", "It has nothing to do with the post, it\u2019s just a vegan that does what vegans do best, which is talk about being vegan.", "He didn\u2019t know when she would be home, it\u2019s not as if he knew she would be joining them and just chose not to buy her food, and it isn\u2019t like he bought himself some extravagant meal, he fed himself and their child because as far as he knew they were going to be the only two people home for dinner. I\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t/can\u2019t be upset, I can see why she was upset and I think she had enough going on that it would reasonably push her over the edge, but that doesn\u2019t make a pretty normal thing some sort of cruel act of incompetence.", "They may have bought groceries but I never but instant meals - I buy fruits, veggies, potatoes, chicken, salmon, pork, etc... It takes some time to cook, I don't eat or buy microwave meals, which is what I sounds like what OP was looking for.", "Exactly!! She had too much on her plate, the very least he could do is grocery shop and have food for her.", "About leaving food to reheat.\n\nAnything else I would say would be entirely based on assumptions, so I\u2019m just gonna leave it there.", "Yeah that\u2019s what it seemed like to me too \ud83d\ude05", "Ask any wife/female partner.  We\u2019d all have made sure there was something to eat when the other spouse got home.  To not be anticipate she would need to eat, whenever she got home, is inconsiderate.", ".... she asked him. She literally ask him to buy food. Bevause there was no food left. And they would need to eat. And he decided to only get him and the kid food... she fucking asked.", "He didn\u2019t know WHEN she would be home, but he knew THAT she would be home (eventually). The husband was hugely inconsiderate. OP was justified in being mad. \n\nBut being fixated on it months later? OP is it possible this isn\u2019t about the Iranian Yogurt?  \n\nIs your husband often this inconsiderate? Is it a bigger problem? Or is it just easier to be mad at your husband than to be sad about your mothers passing? \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is hard and grief is different for everyone. Unless your husband is a huge AH, does it help anything to continue to fixate on this one fight? Maybe you overreacted in your grieving state, but if so, give yourself some grace. If H is usually considerate but messed up once, then maybe it\u2019s best to try and let it go. Maybe he was grieving and exhausted too. But you weren\u2019t wrong to be hurt and upset. NTA.", "She's going to come home eventually. It's pizza. You can eat it cold or reheat it. You don't need to know when someone's going to be home.", "Do these people not own phones?  \"I'm headed home.  Is there any food in the house?\"", "... it is literally in the post he didn't buy grocerys and they didn't even had bread for herself to make a toast...", "Exactly, do these people not own phones? \"We are having pizza. What time are you coming home?\"", "NTA\n\nIf this is a pattern of helpless/inconsiderate behavior on his part, I recommend this be an ongoing conversation with him and you insist on real reflection/change from him. You\u2019ll see more hardships in life, and you need to know he will have your back next time.", "I am so sorry that your partner didn\u2019t support you as he should have.  I went through this with my father two years ago. I don\u2019t know how I would have kept it together without my husband. I spent all day every day at his house, only coming home to sleep as my brother was spending nights there. Husband cooked full meals for us several times or brought take out. He also picked up my slack in our business making sure all the necessities where off my plate. You are absolutely NTA.", "NTA. Expecting a frozen pizza during one of your hardest days is literally the bare minimum of courtesy, something I would've extended to a roommate, let alone my spouse.", "NTA\n\nYou have two children living in your home.", "NTA.\nA marriage is supposed to be a team. When one is in need of support the other should be stepping up and supporting the team.\n\nHe could have gotten enough to have leftovers and saved some for you. If he had cared enough to think about your needs.", "Nta but I think this is something you'll either have to live with or let go. Continuing to hold it against him will not help you. I'm so sorry for your loss. Would order you all the takeout if I could.", "NTA and neither is he. I understand that you're going through a traumatic experience but it seems like you're harboring a resentment so you have somewhere to vent your negative feelings. \n\nIt's time to move on from the meal thing and address your real trauma so you don't continue to lash at your husband. He won't stick around forever if you're going to treat him bad over a mistake and no judge will side with \"Well, he didn't make me dinner!\" if you end up in divorce court. \n\nJust address the real trauma and start your healing process. Cheering you on OP.", "I agree, NAH. He was taking over parenting duties during this crisis and if he\u2019s not used to being the one making sure his spouse eats, it\u2019s not unreasonable to think she\u2019d take care of that herself at some point before coming home. If my partner and I aren\u2019t eating together, the understanding is generally that we fend for ourselves, and I don\u2019t necessarily think his brain would go to \u201coh I need to do something different\u201d during a time of crisis. I certainly wouldn\u2019t blame him for not thinking to buy food for me.", "I also agree with your thoughts b/c when I had \"caretaker hours\" I would just get myself fed even though I was married with a child.  Just made sense to me.", "He watched her for several days not have time to cook. Come on.", "First time I'm replying to one of these. First off very sorry for your loss. I would say NAH but possibly a very soft yta because you said this was one night while things to eat were there the other nights. Your perspective is understandable. You were stressed, upset, and had more than anyone should have to handle on your playe. A blow up is understandable. But you said you were spending 16-18 hrs there. So all of the child care, house hold chores and everyday duties were as instantly thrust on your partner as full time care of your mom was on you. Huge life shift for both of you. But you expected him to be perfect in the shift. Understandable at the time due to stress and grief. However after cooler heads have prevailed there should not still be a grudge held over this. No one is perfect. Sounds like everything was changed for both of you very quickly and your upset he wasn't doing everything he could for you, as well as your son, your house, and your family/mom. No one is superman no matter how much we wish they were or hollywood tells us they can be. Sounds like a tough time where no one is really to blame. Hope your able to communicate and work through this grief and pain together.", "NAH.\n\nIt's okay to be upset about it at the time, but get over it. It's been months and you're upset because there wasn't a frozen meal for you.\n\nHe explained why he didn't grab something quick for you. Even if you don't like the reason, he had one. It's such a minor offense, the fact that you're still upset enough to make this post 3 months later says you've got some other issues you need to take care of. Grow up and get over it.", "Or maybe she is still upset because she is resentful and can't let things go.", "... but she literally asked him to buy food?", "It is not in the post that he didn\u2019t buy groceries. He definitely didn\u2019t buy any ready meals and didn\u2019t leave OP any pizza - that\u2019s in the post - but beyond that we\u2019ve only got assumptions.", "\"There was literally nothing I could heat up.\"\n\nParaphrased:\n\"The other day there were things I could just eat.... toast\"\n\n\nIt is in the post."]}
