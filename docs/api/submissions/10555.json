And we should recognize more the amazing unpaid job they do that also happens to help their partner pursue their career. When i said it shouldn't be expected for women to sacrifice their career, i more meant that it should be discussed early on, before having kids, and not when they discover they are pregnant.

I agree that it's how we change systemic issues, and i would never ask or wait of a woman to not be a stay at home mom if that's what she wants, but social attitudes change by having enough individuals pursue this change. I am not saying it is a duty for women, i just think we are involved in a personnal level and when there are enough people involved in the same directions, changes starts to happen. Like, if i go manifesting in the street, i am in a crowd of people revendicating the same thing as me, i am just one more voice adding to a larger group, but i also took the decision to go there and participate, which is my individual and personal decision. I am not expecting anyone to do something they don't want to do or can't do, but since a lot changed already toward systemic sexism, i think some of these \"average families\" participated too, even if it's by voting, going in manifestations and so on while they have a more traditional way of living because they have to. Of course, and again, it's absolutely normal that the considerations are financial, but it still can feel pretty unfair to some people sadly. And also as i said, i think there are stay at home moms, by choice or not, who also have an impact against systemic sexism, and they don't need to risk being in a difficult place financially speaking, to have this impact. \nSo i just read your last sentence now because i answer while reading pieces by pieces of the comment, and i just saw you said exactly what i wrote in a way too long answer and i don't want to redo it.", "I apologize.

Now he has to look after both kids for a portion of the day that he may be most productive. His compromise seems pretty fair, hire a nanny and they both work and spend time with kids in the evening. Seems pretty unreasonable for her to get to decide to change her mind all of a sudden and tell her husband that he needs to make the change to watch the kids. I think there is more to the story than what is being told.

I am not accusing men by saying that the system we are in is sexist, and i am not saying it's easy, patriarchy hurts everyone, especially when there is a dimension of class added to it. And when men ask for some time to take care of their kids, it happens that people will ask why the mom can't do it, and it's really weird to think that some people consider that dads shouldn't be too involved in raising their kids.

Does OP's wife resent him because she out earns him, to the degree that she belittles his career and says he may as well just tend to the children instead?  That's not to belittle stay at home parents; she just didn't get that fulfillment from being a stay at home parent herself, but it's okay for him to hang up his aspirations because she's more successful.\n\nTo the larger discussion, this whole \"women are considered primary caregivers\" is a complex cultural issue.  Men stepping into domestic roles still has a lot of **buts** attached, and many of those come from social systems where women are \"in power\" so to speak.  Men often can't exist as parents without side-eyes, or otherwise being excluded from \"mother-only\" spaces at times.  Addressing patriarchy/institutional sexism can make sure dad can take parental leave and mom can work, but it won't enable dad to feel safe taking his daughter to a birthday party without being viewed as a creep, or the perpetual \"look who's babysitting\" disdain that is tangential-at-best to the issues of patriarchy.  Unless, of course, I'm misunderstanding the aims of that movement (which is possible)\n\nEdit: one note about the wage gap that I've been interested in is the \"expectation gap\".

I've always seen that as a bit unfair, especially as I have personally been dealing with long term injuries from physical work, but am still \"expected\" to \"man up\" at times.
