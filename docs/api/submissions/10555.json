I do agree a nanny is a decent compromise, but \u201cwe can afford a nanny\u201d isn\u2019t even remotely the same as \u201cwe can still contribute significantly to our savings/retirement fund while also paying a nanny\u201d. Just because they can afford it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to be heavily eating into the money they have left after paying their current expenses. Realistically OP should shift his hours to a little later so they have OP parenting them in the morning, a nanny watching them for the afternoon, then wife parenting in the evenings while OP is still working when she\u2019s back (or have the nanny continue for evenings where wife won\u2019t be back). That way the kids are still getting plenty of time with their actual parents and OP still has the same amount of time to work and wife can also pursue her career. This way, the kids are getting what\u2019s best for them, OP is getting what\u2019s best for him, and wife is getting what\u2019s best for her.", "How do you think they have afforded to live this past year?", "That would cloud the situation, however no one partner should dictate to the other like this or insult the other's work like that.\n\nJust like they agreed together before, they should agree together now.", "I would think it would be the same situation.

Why can't he just adjust his schedule?", "The reason why women are the primary caregiver totally happen because of sexism though, because usually men gain more, so when it comes to decide who stays home based on income, the result usually end up being women. Not saying this is the case here and maybe she also wanted to stay at home when they took the decision, but talking about the choice depending on income without seeing the sexism that usually create these different incomes is just wrong\n\nEdit: a few reasons why women gain less is that what are considered to be feminine jobs are actually paid less than masculine jobs, women have a harder time getting higher positions, so position where the pay is better, they are quicker to cut their time at work to take the charge of housechore and childcare, and there still is a wage gap even if a lot of people deny it. \nIt's in french but here is a source for the wage gap.

She entirely supported them, and had to pay daycare TOO because he wouldn't do child care.

It\u2019s a cultural rut of sorts. I\u2019ve worked places where moms have a ton of leeway to leave early, come in late, etc where dads don\u2019t get nearly the same flexibility.

In any case, it doesn't come across that money is the concern, rather that OP doesn't want to give up a job they care about. Even if OP's career was still getting started, they would have decided they had the financial security for them to live on savings. Assuming that a career in writing is equivalent to mooching isn't fair.", "True, that is a fair point.  Didn't think about savings", "For me personally, trying to keep up with child care while working from home just isn\u2019t possible, and my kids are older than 1 year old twins!  OP described having a garden office to separate work and home life, and this is essential for many people working remotely to maintain their mental health.  Everyone is different, and your experience is tinted by the anecdote of a husband able to care for children while building a business in garage and being successful in both, but that is not going to be possible for everyone.\n\nAs for \u201cresentment\u201d.  I don\u2019t resent my wife for not creating an income as a stay at home mom in this stage of our life, even though we can\u2019t afford a nicer house or to save much for retirement.  I wouldn\u2019t resent her if she wanted to re-enter the workplace and place our kids in daycare either.  And I certainly hope she doesn\u2019t resent me for not earning more income and not needing to have these discussions!

And is it right to expect women to still leave their job and sacrifice themselves for their family because of the patriarchy ? We should be in a system where having a family isn't equal to the woman sacrificing her career and herself but where people can choose. The system is sexist in itself and thus pushes people to do what's the best financially, which is still heavily linked to the idea that men are providers, but it shouldn't be the default.", "I hope you guys find a way to talk through what's really going on. \n\nI have a 8 month old and 22 month old and am a sahm.

I work in the entertainment industry, though on the technical side of things, but the amount of \"professional\" musicians, DJs, artists, writers, and comedians I know makes me doubt when people say they do it professionally. The John Mulaney bit about it being the only career you can claim to be part of while not actually being payed to do it rings so true. I know about a dozen \"professional writers\" who have never been paid to write, which makes you a hobbyists.", "Very fair point.\n\nUnfortunately, I know far too many people who consider themselves professional writers who don't contribute financially to the family, or only nominally.  And I know a few who are successful financially.  Both groups are absorbed in their writing, on a full time basis, and take it quite seriously.  Those who contribute are seen as having value in their work, and are considered \"employed\".  Those who aren't contributing ... well.  They're either working the proverbial waiter jobs to pay the rent, or a partner supports them.  \n\nSo I agree that I could be more supportive of the arts.  I have bias.\n\nIt is the fact that the wife is asking OP to do the childcare that tells me he's not otherwise contributing.  If she took his career seriously, she'd hire the nanny, happily, particularly if finances are not an issue.

So yes, the question is valid.", "Of course you don't resent your wife for being a stay at home Mom.  She's contributing to the family.  That's my whole point. The contribution doesn't need to be financial if there is a contribution otherwise.\n\nThe two of you are working in partnership.  And that's the important part. You are BOTH contributing.  You financially, her with child care. You work at home and can't do it - I completely understand. The job I did couldn't be done at home while doing childcare.  So your wife is doing it. That's working together, both contributing.  I honestly think it's wonderful.  \n\nThat's the gist.  OP says they can afford a nanny.  Great. How?  Is wife's income paying for it?  So he can go to his garden office without contributing to the family?  Will he be asking her to carry the whole load?  \n\nSo he is asking that he not contribute to the family, with child care, as wife is asking him to.  Is he contributing somewhere else?

Why is having a nanny a no go for you and the wife?\n\nWhere does OP get to land in this 'compromise' apart from just doing as he's told?", "I wish society were different in the same respects as well. The situation thrust upon them may be sexist but that doesn\u2019t mean either of them are sexist or that women who stay at home because they have less earning potential are. Systemic sexism is solved by changes in public policy and social attitudes, not by the average family making choices that put less money in their pockets. \u201cNot really having a choice\u201d to do something other than what is in their financial interest is not something the average family can usually afford. Again, when most families are making family decisions about child care, the considerations are financial, not ideological. Basing financial decisions off of the society we \u201cshould\u201d live in rather than the realities of the one we do live in is not something average families can afford. Plenty of ways to fight systemic sexism without putting your family in a worse financial situation.", "People are also delusional, and it's important to check before providing advice.

A professional writer(novelist and screenwriter), so I\u2019m going to assume he makes money from that.", "How is it compromising to get a nanny?", "I absolutely agree, and that's why i said it's maybe not their choice, or a choice they made because it's more convenient, but not because they are actively sexist. I also think it's very important to consider women who are stay at home moms by choice and happinness, as equals and legitimate just like other women. And we should recognize more the amazing unpaid job they do that also happens to help their partner pursue their career. When i said it shouldn't be expected for women to sacrifice their career, i more meant that it should be discussed early on, before having kids, and not when they discover they are pregnant. Especially since sometimes it's expected no matter the financial situation, because it also depends for some people on their values. I agree that it's how we change systemic issues, and i would never ask or wait of a woman to not be a stay at home mom if that's what she wants, but social attitudes change by having enough individuals pursue this change. I am not saying it is a duty for women, i just think we are involved in a personnal level and when there are enough people involved in the same directions, changes starts to happen. Like, if i go manifesting in the street, i am in a crowd of people revendicating the same thing as me, i am just one more voice adding to a larger group, but i also took the decision to go there and participate, which is my individual and personal decision. I am not expecting anyone to do something they don't want to do or can't do, but since a lot changed already toward systemic sexism, i think some of these \"average families\" participated too, even if it's by voting, going in manifestations and so on while they have a more traditional way of living because they have to. Of course, and again, it's absolutely normal that the considerations are financial, but it still can feel pretty unfair to some people sadly. And also as i said, i think there are stay at home moms, by choice or not, who also have an impact against systemic sexism, and they don't need to risk being in a difficult place financially speaking, to have this impact. \nSo i just read your last sentence now because i answer while reading pieces by pieces of the comment, and i just saw you said exactly what i wrote in a way too long answer and i don't want to redo it.", "I apologize.

They don't have to be in the same areas of responsibility, provided that both are contributing in ways that are satisfying to both parties.  Equity doesn't mean equally the same.
