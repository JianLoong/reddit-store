It's worth noting that Aunt Tracey was not the happiest when I got with Sabrina. She is Christian (although I am too). She's always bringing up the fact that I'm bi as a point that I can still find a man to date. Obviously kind of homophobic but I deal with it because she's family and not too awful about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile my mom and aunt were doing last minute preparations for dinner, me and Sabrina were playing with Emma in the living room. I introduced Emma to Sabrina and told her the truth, that we are dating. I was worried at first, but I just said \"me and Sabrina love each other in the way that your mom and dad do\" and she seemed to get it. She was in a silly mood and pointed at us and said \"then kiss!!\" so I started towards Sabrina like I was going to kiss her. Emma exploded into giggles and said \"STOP!!\" so I stopped, and then slowly started to lean forwards again. Emma while screaming with laughter pulled us apart and then said \"KISS AGAIN\". This went on a few more times and she was howling with little kid laughter the entire time. At the end, I kissed Sabrina triumphantly while Emma screamlaughed and tried to pry us apart, and at that moment Tracey walked in. She gasped (you would have thought she saw a ghost) and grabbed Emma immediately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe then yelled at me and Sabrina for doing that in front of Emma, saying that was so inappropriate. I explained that we told Emma we were dating and that she understood it, but that only made Tracey angrier and she started screaming about how we were exposing Emma to that type of content and she'd probably be traumatized or messed up from this. I started yelling back, telling her that if Emma gets messed up, it's because her mom is such an \"a\\*\\*hole\" (my exact words). At this point my mom stepped in and told Aunt Tracey to leave. Emma was crying because people were yelling and wouldn't look at me to say bye.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day, I was still super mad, but I started to think that maybe I was somehow in the wrong. My other aunt who lives across the country and couldn't make it messaged me saying what I did was so wrong and Tracey has been calling her crying. I felt really bad when I heard this. I didn't mean to teach Emma about these things, I don't know if 6 is too early to learn about different relationships or if it should have been a conversation with her mom. I also think I might be wrong for cursing in front of Emma and escalating the situation by yelling back. It makes me sad to think about Emma's teary face as she left the house and that I had something to do with it. My mom wants me to apologize to Tracey just to clear the air, but I refuse to say something until she does. Am I in the wrong for this?

You and your gf were innocently playing and culminated with a peck on the lips.  It isn't like you two were undressing each other in front of your cousin.\n\nYour aunt's homophobia is sickening, and I feel bad that your cousin is exposed to a crazy religious bigot.\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong, your aunt is the AH here with her over reaction to something innocent.\n\nI imagine that your aunt and uncle share pecks on the lips with each other in front of your cousin.", "INFO: Playful light kiss or INVOLVED kiss?\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA.", "NTA, a couple having a quick kiss is not inappropriate. Do her parents not kiss or hug? What's wrong with children learning what a happy affectionate couple is?", "NTA.  Sorry your aunt is a fucking bigot.  Would she have freaked out if you and a male friend/boyfriend kissed?  I'd bet not.\n\nif a kid can see their parents kiss, they should be fine seeing other people kiss too.", "Damn bro it\u2019s just a kiss. Yall weren\u2019t even doing anything inappropriate from the sounds of it, just messing around with your cousin. \n \nNTA, but your aunt is a nut job. You should demand an apology.", "Considering your cousin asking you to kiss she obviously knew enough about relationships to know that this is a common way to show affection in them. The only issue here is who you are in a relationship with. If what you did would have been with a male partner there wouldn't have been any issue at all. That's why you're NTA. \n\nIf your cousin wouldn't have known anything about romantic relationships (independent of gay or straight) or would have been uncomfortable, it would be different. But because this entire thing is only an issue to your aunt because of the gender of your partner she is TA. Maybe ask her if she also kisses her partner in front of their daugther and how this is acceptable but you doing the same with your partner isn't. If she is able to give you a legitimate explanation you can still consider apologising. If she can't (which I expect) she owes you one", "NTA. I worked at a children's center for a few years. We used to explain (age appropriate) this concept to two years olds. You were fine. The kid was fine. Your aunt is a hysterical homophobe.", "I mean would it be inappropriate in your eyes if your gf was a man to kiss them in front of your sibling? I mean they learn about princes and princesses and stuff it\u2019s not like it\u2019s new science. The kid is crying bc she\u2019s scared. Probably wasn\u2019t cool to call the mother an asshole in front of the kid tho", "AH for calling aunt an asshole in front of her kid\n\nNTA for kissing gf", "NTA for kissing your girlfriend in front of your little cousin. There is nothing wrong with that whatsoever. Tbh I am letting my own kids grow up in the knowledge that all sorts of of consensual, romantic relationships (gay, straight, poly etc) are perfectly normal. If a kid is old enough to understand that people can be in love, then they are old enough to know that other types of relationships than just straight relationships exist too. \n\nHOWEVER I might give you just the tiiiiiniest YTA for yelling and calling your aunt an asshole in front of your little cousin, even if I understand why. It probably scared her. I would just have saved the angry yelling for later when she wasn't present. \n\nI hope you and your gf are alright, and that you will continue to have a positive relationship with your little cousin. She sounds like such a fun little angel.", "NTA. you brought some other truths to that little girl. maybe she'll remember this and question the mothers unaccepting views when she gets older. I can't imagine a 6 year old being traumatized by someone screaming at her mother. I'd sneak a talk in with the girl though and try to explain it's hurtful to be judged because you like women.\n\nAlso. pro tip. keeping your cool  but taking the fight in a conversational tone. can be even more offensive to your \"opponent\" then yelling. And with onlookers I think they are the ones you affect. Debating with people of very opposing  minds will likely drive the wedge deeper. but in taking a stand you might cause the girl to ask herself *why? \" next time the bigot explains why homosexuals go to hell. \n\n(Religion has some nice sides to it. spreading thoughtfulness and all that But that often is negated by when its influence is used to tell people who is wrong to love or sleep with.) \n\nBy the way why should kids be protected from affection, death, temper and other tabu subjects? Better learn early to make sense of the world imo.", "NTA, but imo maybe a little too playful given the circumstance. Unfortunately you were around someone who is a complete AH. My only hope is that it won\u2019t stop you from being able to see your cousin in the near future.", "Nta. But might be a core somewhat traumatic memory. Probs not tho... for me it wouldve been but i have an annoying never forget anything memory lol. Similar memory for me when i was 5.", "INFO: Your aunt referred to your real life actions as 'content'?", "Info: how did the \"she's my girlfriend\" conversation come up?", "5 or 6 was the age I was when I FIRST started kissing girls... you did nothing but show her that there are different types of love NTA", "ESH. Your aunt obviously has issues and sounds like a nightmare. That said, as a gay man myself I think you overstepped by explaining your relationship to a 6 year old. You took the ability for their parent to have that type of conversation with their child away and parent their child as they see fit away. While I may not think the way they parent is the best way\u2026 I do believe that overstepping parents isn\u2019t ok. You should\u2019ve asked your aunt before you did -and if you had you probably would\u2019ve avoided all of this. Because without that explanation you wouldn\u2019t have had your cousin prompting for kisses, which would\u2019ve meant no issue\u2026. But making the decision to have that talk without talking to a parent first\u2026 you set this all in motion yourself. So yeah, ESH.", "ESH\n\nComing from the point of a kindergarten teacher: 6 is not too young to know that not everyone is straight. For children all sexualities are normal but some don\u2019t get represented and therefore start being seen as not normal. This is why representation (like you and your gf) is super important.\n\nYour aunt is the AH for the obvious homophobia and is teaching your niece that homosexuality is wrong and something very bad. I don\u2019t even wanna think about the trauma she might give her if your niece is homosexual.\n\nAnd while I think you didn\u2019t do anything actual wrong (as I said above, children need representation) and I also absolutely understand your reaction, you still provoked a situation in that your niece now connects two women kissing with yelling, conflict and having to leave. That could have been prevented if you had first talked to your aunt that you wouldn\u2019t conceal your relationship. So YTA even though just a very small one.\n\nOh and your other aunt is also the AH for siding with your aunt and making you feel bad about your sexuality instead of calming her down and explaining to her that niece won\u2019t be traumatised and will at some point learn about homosexuality anyways.", "[deleted]", "My sister lives with her boyfriend. I refer to him as husband, they've been together long enough it just slips out. I'm Christian and believe in monogamy and marriage before living together etc. She drinks alcohol and coffee, we don't do either. Before spending time with them at a restaurant, family gathering, etc where our kids might see them do things we choose not to in our house, we sat our kids down and talked to them. My sister and SO aren't bad people, they just choose to live life differently than we do. If she drinks alcohol, or coffee, it's okay because that's how she chooses to live her life. If someone is different, they still deserve respect and love and to be treated good. That doesn't mean you have to do the same, or make fun of them for being different than you.\n\nTalking to them proactively beforehand prevented misunderstandings like this from happening. That said, I did set some boundaries with my sister. Please don't get drunk when around my kids, not a problem anyway she doesn't drink that much, and try not to say OMG, otherwise do your thing. I respect her choices and as long as she respects mine, like as long as shes not trying to sneak coffee to the kids (she wouldn't) ... we're good.\n\nSame sex relationships would have a similar, but obviously different, conversation. I'd communicate beforehand with the partners and let em know I was fine with them coming and their relationship even with the difference in beliefs and let em do their thing. A peck is a peck, they'll see it eventually and I'd rather it be consensual and loving. (If applicable, as with anyone... eh prone to excessive PDA, I'd ask them to not make out or get explicit since I'D be uncomfortable.) It's the lack of communication beforehand when it was known of strong religious beliefs beforehand that set this up. \n\nI'd say ESH. Aunt reacted terribly to good fun anf she could have explained later to daughter, or simply said please don't do that again in front of her or almost any othe reaction would have been better. OP, knowing she had strong feelings about it, kissing anyway was bound to cause a reaction. Especially making a game of it, innocent on your side or not. When strong religious biases and natural protective instincts kick in, and protection of SO and self kicks in on the other side, no good communication can happen. I'd apologize to aunt you didn't take her views into consideration, and explain in your view it was just innocent fun she was giggling at, and not intended to expose her daughter to anything. That is, if you care to try and preserve the relationship... but otherwise apologize for scaring the daughter and swearing about aunt and just minimize contact for all of your sake.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
