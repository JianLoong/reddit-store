He got angry. Told me that he can\u2019t help it and that I\u2019m fine and that crying isn\u2019t going to help me and to just go to sleep. I told him I have been trying for 2.5 hours and I can\u2019t.

He might have RLS, but even still, he could have gotten *himself* up and moved to the couch knowing that there wasn\u2019t much he could do to stop kicking. You know, rather than making his pregnant and sleep deprived wife get up.", "Eh, NAH -- But it sounds like he might have RLS and needs to get that treated. My husband does this, too, and I've awakened covered in bruises from his kicking. He started using magnesium, which has cut down on the kicking dramatically. Treatment really can help, and you'll both sleep better for it.", "NTA for being tired and emotional but he can\u2019t help it really. Short of getting some early swaddling practice in and swaddling him up nice and tight he\u2019s not going to be able to stop voluntarily. \n\nThat being said\u2026 he shouldn\u2019t be ok with you being forced out of the bed. 6-8 times a minute is crazy. My husband snores occasionally and he woke up one morning and I was sleeping in the spare room. I was heavily pregnant, got up to pee and couldn\u2019t get back to sleep while his face hole was making noise so I went to sleep in the spare room, he said if that happens again to wake him and he\u2019ll go sleep in the spare single bed.", "He probably has restless leg syndrome of something similar.

But he can\u2019t control kicking in his sleep. He needs to go see his doctor", "NAH\n\nBut you should consider a medical checkup. It could be a sleep disorder causing the continuous kicking. But in the meantime, you should consider a temporary solution.", "NTA he is a whole adult and doesn't have the decency to go sleep on the couch so he doesn't kick his pregnant wife in his sleep?? And he's rude about it too. I would be pissed. \n\nMany comments are saying medical issues and while that might be an explanation it's definitely not an excuse to make you go sleep on the couch (at 39 weeks) pregnant.", "NTA but your husband is for not just moving to the lounge instead of you. Him getting angry with you for reacting to his excessive kicking in his sleep is not cool. Why is he mad and not apologetic? Even as a kid when I would kick aggressively in my sleep, id be so sorry for the people who dealt with it and find ways to remove the issue for them. Why can't he have any empathy for his pregnant wife?\n\nAlso, if he's actually doing this in his sleep and it's not some other thing, he should go do a sleep study so they can determine WTF is making that happen and help him to stop. You shouldn't have to just deal with physical violence from him just bc he is sleeping when it happens.", "NTA, but he actually can't help it if he's doing it while asleep. You guys need separate beds.", "NTA - i know he can\u2019t help it, but he should have at least offered to sleep on the couch rather than you as you are pregnant. must be frustrating.", "He can help it by seeing a doctor, being evaluated for restless leg syndrome and taking medication.", "NAH -- but he actually probably can't help it?

Let him know on nights he kicks a lot he will need to sleep on the lounge because you\u2019re pregnant and simply cannot.\n\nCommunicate your expectations with him, but be realistic.

Stretching before bed is always a good idea. Not heavy exercise, but some thing like a walk around the neighborhood to make sure that the body has been moved. And then doing the stretching about 15 or so minutes before getting into bed helps. Also food that helps make sure you're full and there are certain things like melatonin that can help calm the body before bed.\n\nThat being said though as well, if he's the one kicking he should be falling asleep somewhere else. At least until after you are not pregnant anymore. Pregnancy does require a lot of rest and this is going to be when you're only times over the next what three to four years that you really get decent sleep.", "Your husband has \"restless legs\" syndrome which is not his fault. I have the same, I can kick so hard it looks like I'm playing for the best soccer team on the planet. The solution is to get separate beds. My husband and I have separate beds that are shoved against each other and we also have separate blankets. Best night sleep ever for both of us since we don't sleep in the same bed, it's awesome. And yes, we still have \"fun\" time.\n\nYou are a bit of an asshole to ask him to stop - his kicking are unvoluntary movements.\n\nGo for separate beds, believe me.", "YTA. He\u2019s ASLEEP. What did you expect? Ask him (kindly) to sleep somewhere else, but lying there until you\u2019ve worked yourself into a panic attack is incredibly non-productive and immature. Keeping him from sleeping just because you can\u2019t sleep does not fix anything, which is why he got angry.", "yta, like i get you\u2019re pregnant but crying because someone else is restless in their sleep is absolutely ridiculous. these ppl are gonna validate your reaction and blame your husband but no. you could\u2019ve asked him to lay somewhere else when it started or moved yourself but you sat there waking him up until he snapped and then cried.. yes you\u2019re pregnant but he\u2019s literally sleeping and can\u2019t help what he\u2019s doing. that\u2019s like him getting mad at you for moving around cause your belly is uncomfortable.", "Sounds like restless leg syndrome, which is not something he will a) be aware of when he's sleeping or b) be able to stop. Best get him to a Dr and get him checked out. Being pregnant is exhausting, you are NTA for asking him to stop. But don't make the mistake of thinking he can help it, or is aware of it. Some people find high dose magnesium spray really helps. Hope he (and you) can get some relief soon", "NTA. Your husband isn't an asshole for kicking because, as a sleepwalker myself, what you do in your sleep isn't within your control. It's your subconscious at the wheel.\nHOWEVER he IS an asshole for his dismissive remarks. You're not fine. You're heavily pregnant and he's kicking you.\nHE needs to sleep on the couch until he sees a doctor to get this under control. YOU need the bed more than he does. If it's RLS, there are ways to treat it; until then, he should be kicking away on the couch. Not next to you.", "Nta.\n\nHusband should sleep somewhere else. You're about to pop. He should be more considerate.", "39 weeks pregnant?!  You're at the end of your pregnancy and your comfort should matter the most.  The husband needs to be more accommodating.  If I was him, I'd volunteer to be on the lounge. NTA.", "NAH... consider separate beds. You need your sleep. I dont know if a heavy pillow between you would help.  He should speak to a doctor.", "I sympathise, but you try going to sleep holding a spoon and  not letting go.\n\nYou will find that it is impossible to make your body do or not do something whilst you are sleeping.\n\nSetting up a separate bed, even a camper bed, might be the best way forward for the time being.", "YTA; how the hell is he supposed to control his movements in his sleep. Are you implying he is doing it on purpose lmao you dumb", "Could you have separate blankets? My gf and I have our own set of blankets because we both like ours set up differently. We have our own duvets too. If we wanna cuddle we can come under the others blankets but for the most part I\u2019m wrapped up and so is she. I originally did it because I had surgery but we liked it so we kept it", "NAH \n\nHe doesn't know he's doing it and you can't sleep. My husband is the same and some things that worked were placing a barrier (like a body pillow) between us and I have a separate smaller under blanket that keeps me from feeling movement transfer into the upper blanket. On esp rough nights I throw off the upper blanket. I have had to sleep on the couch a few times just to get sleep.", "NTA. He can\u2019t control it but he\u2019s the AH for telling you to get over it. My nana has a separate bedroom because her veteran husband will punch in his sleep.

Start at the PCP but it may require a sleep study. \n\nCome up with a plan b. Put a twin bed in the nursery or somewhere so one of you can move beds if you have to until it\u2019s figured out.", "[deleted]", "Until he gets into a sleep doctor order 2 twin beds for the bedroom. If you can't do that, get a long body pillow and place it UNDER the bottom sheet to pin down a barrier between the two of you.", "YTA-  Sorry, but he likely can\u2019t help it.  Obviously he didn\u2019t need to respond the way he did, but that\u2019s beside the point.  You can\u2019t expect someone to be able to control themselves when sleeping.", "YTA for thinking that he's doing it consciously just to annoy you.", "Soft YTA. He can't control it, and it's reasonable that he was cranky after being woken several times. \n\nIt's also reasonable that you were upset, as you are also sleep deprived, physically uncomfortable, and have end of pregnancy hormones surging. \n\nYou'll probably get a better result if you talk to him during the day and problem solve together.  As others have suggested, he may need a sleep study, but that can take quite some time to schedule. \n\nGood luck with your new baby, and Congratulations!", "YTA. If my wife woke me up repeatedly during the night because of something I was doing in my sleep instead of just getting out of bed and going to sleep in the guest bedroom or on the couch because she's clearly awake and I'm clearly already asleep in our bed, then you'd be getting a lot worse than \"you're fine and you will eventually go to sleep\" from me. \n\nIf he's already asleep in the bed, imo it's on you to remove yourself. You can't ask someone who's already asleep to get up and get out of bed when you're awake and have been the whole time. You also can't complain that you're having a panic attack from his sleep kicking when you've had hours to get up and remove yourself from the situation.", "NTA. The kicker should get the couch and the pregnant person gets the bed.", "NTA for asking but YTA for getting angry that it didn't stop.  People don't have control over their bodies when we're asleep...you think all the snorers of the world want to snore, sleep farters want to gas out their partners? That's just not how it works.  If he's actively kicking in his sleep it could be RLS as others have suggested and he can get on a medication to help with that. I actually developed RLS when I was pregnant and it is a miserable feeling so cut the guy some slack.\n\nI'm sorry you're emotional because you're pregnant and you're probably already struggling to get decent sleep, but your husband isn't doing this to annoy or antagonize you. You did the right thing by going to sleep in another location.  if he refuses to see a doctor to try to get to the bottom of the kicking then I think it would be perfectly okay to have him sleep in the lounge as you getting comfortable is going to be more different than it will be for him.", "NTA he needs to sleep there not make his pregnant partner do that. He needs to acknowledge his sleep patterns. Start kicking him every time he kicks and if he don't like it oh well.", "ESH.  Him for not getting this addressed and getting angry with you.  You for expecting him to just be able to change without some sort of medical or other intervention.  Short of tying his legs down or medication for RLS or whatever is going on, he's not able to control it.", "NTA. But his attitude when you're pregnant says a lot about him. What if he'd kicked you out of bed and you'd fallen down? Isn't that supremely dangerous? That's almost 9 months. At that point in your pregnancy if you have a fall... How wide is your bed? Either way it's not okay. Even if there was no chance of you falling, you need your rest. It might be better if you spend the rest of your pregnancy away from him for your own rest and health. If there's a guest bedroom maybe sleep there? He doesn't seem like the kinda person who'd sleep there instead of kicking you out. \n\nHe may not be able to help the kicking or the moving but he can certainly fix his attitude.\n\nEdit. I know a friend who got kicked out of bed by their partner who kicks and moves in their sleep. Which is where my thought process is coming from. That was a queen size bed and she had moved to the edge to avoid getting disturbed.", "I say NTA instead of NAH because while he's probably not purposefully kicking you, his reaction to you waking him up to let him know is what pushes him into the AH territory. He should have moved to the couch, not tell his pregnant wife to just deal with being kicked.", "NTA and to be honest he should\u2019ve gone and slept somewhere else - my boyfriend snores horrendously when he\u2019s been drinking and will voluntarily sleep on the sofa after a night out because he doesn\u2019t want to bother me. \n\nIt\u2019s not up to you to get used to his kicking and you\u2019re not at fault for being bothered by it. He\u2019s the one with the annoying habit and he needs to take responsibility for it, ESPECIALLY since he\u2019s got a pregnant wife that needs to sleep. \n\nObviously he\u2019s not doing it on purpose, but he\u2019s an AH for basically saying you should just get used to it and seemingly not doing anything to help. \n\nI\u2019d honestly recommend just sleeping separately if possible. You both need to sleep and this kind of issue is one that\u2019s gonna be a lot hotter discussed by two sleep deprived people, even more so when there\u2019s two sleep deprived people with a newborn baby. You can\u2019t both be running on fumes.", "YTA and also don't seem to be thinking rationally. I also doubt you had a panic attack because you couldn't sleep how you wanted to \ud83d\ude44", "He can\u2019t stop, is the thing. It\u2019s not something he can control. Sounds like some kind of restless leg thing. He should follow up with his doc. \n\nHowever, a good partner, when made aware of the fact that he\u2019s keeping his heavily pregnant partner awake, would apologize at the very least. Nta.", "How the fuck do you expect him to stop something he LITERALLY can't control?\n\nYou are an AH", "NTA I\u2019ve been there where you feel absolutely miserable at 39 weeks pregnant and know just how overwhelming it can be. I know your husband can\u2019t help it and it sounds like he needs to talk with a doc, but in my opinion he should have been nicer to you and should have offered to go sleep elsewhere since he was being especially active that night.", "YTA, if you\u2019re going to complain about something you should offer a solution. He\u2019s tired too. Next time build a pillow wall between the two of you.", "YTA, you seem like the type of person that would get angry at him for something he did in a dream you had. Grow up.", "Yta.  It\u2019s probably restless leg syndrome which can be treated.  But waking him up over and over for something he cannot control makes you the asshole.", "I mean, he definitely can't help it if he's asleep, but he should be the one sleeping somewhere else, not you.", "NTA. He is right, he can't do anything about it. But with a pregnant wife, he should get out of the bed and let you be comfortable there, no question.", "NTA, he gets to sleep in the lounge moving forward.", "NTA - I don't agree with those voting No Assholes Here because he is absolutely one for being so cruel to you. It's not his fault he is kicking in his sleep, but he shouldn't be angry about being awakened and he sure as hell should not be the one allowing you to sleep on the couch while you are carrying HIS child.", "NTA. Why didn't he move to the couch or something? He sounds pretty inconsiderate. \"Hey stop kicking me please\". \"Nah, you'll get used to it eventually\". Like wtf", "NAH. I doubt he did it on purpose, you are scared. Both is understandable", "He can\u2019t help it, but he should be sleeping on the lounge not you.", "NTA put him on the couch.", "NTA\u2026 and the husband is TA for not caring about the fact that he might accidentally kick his pregnant wife and injure both of them. He should\u2019ve volunteered to sleep in another room and not have his pregnant wife sleep in the lounge while he gets to sleep in the bed. So very insensitive.", "NAH sounds like restless leg syndrome. Has he considered having it checked out or have you considered sleeping in separate beds or rooms for now?", "NAH\n\nUp his magnesium. I did a sleep study and they counted a ridiculous amount of times I moved my kegs during sleep. Initially put me in 4 tabs a day of magnesium (bottle only recommends 2). It took a little while to kick in but restless leg is basically gone now. I still take 2 tabs a day of magnesium and will up it to 4 if I get an episode. I don\u2019t take 4 as maintenance dose as side effect of that much magnesium can be a bit of loose bowel. I sleep so much better now!", "NTA\n\nIts not unreasonable in your condition to be having issues with his sleep kicking. I am curious if he is typically dismissive of your concerns when fully conscious or if he just doesn't realize how bad his kicking actually was. Unfortunately, the middle of the night is not a great time for a serious discussion even if he's a great guy 99% of the time for the simple fact that no one is much prepared to talk and act like adults when woken up in the middle of the night.\n\nI would definitely sit him down and talk to him about it in depth, in the full light of day, after everyone has had their morning coffee.", "Ma'am, he's asleep. He literally cannot help what he does while he's unconscious. Yes, it fucking sucks for you but I don't know what you expect him to do exactly. Sounds like you need separate beds. ESH, you for exploding over something that he cannot control and him for being dismissive of your feelings and not taking the couch himself", "YTA if it was bothering you to the point of a panic attack get up and go sleep on the couch. You can talk to him about it in the morning when you\u2019re both coherent, but you let yourself spend hours working yourself up to a panic attack. That\u2019s on you.", "How can the man help what he does in his sleep? And why is that panic-attack worthy? My partner snores like a hibernating bear, so either we sleep separately, which I prefer because he's an artist and frequently wakes up in the middle of the night to work on a project, or I wear earplugs. YTA", "YTA, the fuck is this man supposed to do to control himself while unconscious. If it\u2019s that much of an issue have one of you sleep elsewhere. You being pregnant doesn\u2019t even matter here.", "NTA. THe priority needs to be you sleeping restfully and uninterrupted. If he can't sleep in the same bed with you without disrupting that, he's the one who needs to get up and sleep elsewhere. Leaving a pregnant woman with no good option is abuse.", "Nah.

I would be worried about other neurological or sleep conditions, including some caused by medication. He should definitely see a neurologist.", "NTA. You're pregnant, although he may not control the kicks in his dreams, he could act way more sensitive!!! Why doesn't he sleep on the couch??? Buy a pregnancy pillow and lay it between you and him. If he complains,  he needs to find another place to sleep. He could kick you in the stomach and hurt the baby! If he doesn't understand anything, leave this moron.", "NTA. Send him to a sleep clinic and if he continues send him to sleep on the lounge, you're carrying his child, you're growing an entire human and you're almost ready to pop! You alone with your body and the body of the baby inside you are extremely uncomfortable and your organs are squished, not to mention, baby kicks can also sometimes hurt a little, so now you have to stand a grown ass adult kicking YOU?

Nope, he needs to go to a sleep clinic NOW", "YTA. I get night terrors. I completely have no control over them and often wake up my husband. Get separate beds.", "YTA He can't help it if he does it in his sleep. You are waking him up solely to join in your misery.", "YTA this reminds me of my wife waking me up to tell me to stop snoring.

My PPD panic was so bad I had to be on Xanax. I hope he becomes more supportive cause... Yeesh.", "NTA. And I know it's not on purpose but his reaction/ answer about this pisses me off.  He needs to sleep somewhere else if he can't stop kicking.", "Holy fuck YTA. Instead of waking him up why didn't you just go sleep somewhere else? How passive aggressive and controlling can you really be? Imagine being such an asshole that you think someone can control what they do in their sleep. Get the hell up and go to sleep somewhere else.", "Wel", "Yes, you are the AH because you are expecting someone who is asleep to control their body movements. They are asleep, that kind of conscious control is not available.\n\nI\u2019ll also say it\u2019s actually somewhat concerning that he\u2019s moving around so much in his sleep. Normally the brain has a mechanism called sleep paralysis to prevent excessive movement in the limbs while in REM sleep. He needs to see a doctor about it because it could be a sign of neurological or musculoskeletal issues.\n\n\nAnd until he gets checked out by a doctor, sleep in separate beds.  You and your baby need as much undisturbed sleep as possible.", "If he's asleep, what do you expect him to do? He's unconscious. He's not kicking on purpose.\n\nI think two things need to happen here. First, your husband should talk with his doctor about his restless sleeping, just to make sure nothing is wrong. Second, the two of you need to sleep separately until you can sleep comfortably together.

I recommend sleeping apart for a while until you guys figure out a better option.\n\nI do think his reaction was rude, however if he was just woken up I can understand how he could be grumpy bc if I am woken up during a sleep I am a completely different human being.

My husband and I discovered about 7 years ago that we get much better sleep in separate beds. I toss and turn quite a bit. He doesn't toss and turn at all and he wants the blankets to stay put over him. He also has to sleep partially sitting up and I don't. He constructed a custom narrow bed frame thing that is the same length and height as our bed and made a mechanism that lets it slide up and down at different sitting angles. It's pushed up against the side of our main bed. We still have plenty of room to snuggle and do adult things in bed when we want to but when it's time to actually sleep, he rolls over to his bed thing.

You're completely valid in being super upset and being done with the situation, just don't expect awake behavior from someone who's not awake.\n\nNow if this is behavior he's doing routinely even when perfectly awake, you've got a different problem on your hands.

She's gotten better about waking me more fully if she expects me to actually respond as requested in the middle of the night.\n\nI guess I just don't feel comfortable assigning any amount of blame on someone who we don't know whether they were conscious or not. And we don't know any of their relationship outside of this, how he generally treats her, especially in regards to her pregnancy. If he constantly acts like this in regards to her comfort while pregnant, then it's part of a pattern, but if not I'd chalk it up to the expected result of trying to convince a barely conscious person to change their unconscious behavior lol\n\nBut yeah, I think it's just a bad night and hopefully they can talk while both awake and come to a reasonable solution, and maybe see a doctor about it potentially being a symptom of RLS or something similar."]}
