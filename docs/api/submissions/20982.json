Beth and Meg were too young to expect them to contribute, but Kate decided it would be a good time to up and move away with her new boyfriend.\n\nAs our mom\u2019s health declined she repeatedly asked for her daughters. She forgot my face but called the names of her other children who didn\u2019t even come visit. Beth and Meg were unhelpful, but they still made an effort to come see her (though rarely).\n\nAround the halfway point of this terrible process Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Our mom was fragile and definitely had issues (she struggled with severte depression and anxiety) but she never mistreated us. I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them.\n\nThe lies devastated our mom but eventually she was too far gone to understand. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone. It was just in her nature to forgive, especially if it was her children. I\u2019m sure that if she had been all there she still would have wanted nothing more than to see her daughter.\n\nMy relationship with all three of my sisters deteriorated, but Kate took the cake.

I told her that she\u2019s owed absolutely nothing and to enjoy living in whatever shithole she crawled out of. Anything she\u2019s given will be spent on drugs and stupid shit like lottery tickets. I won\u2019t fund that when it could go to helping my nieces attend college or give them something to lean on after turning 18.\n\nOur extended family are picking sides and saying I\u2019m being petty. They said my mother would want Kate to have the money, but I know that if she got even a penny from me she\u2019d see it as an opportunity to squeeze me for all I have. She's not getting anything, even when I'm old and senile.\n\nEdit: It was not put into writing that I need to divide everything equally. I am the only inheritor listed on the will.

I'm curious about Kate's side of the story. You deny your mother was abusive and immediately say that you had to play parent to your sisters because your mom couldn't for whatever mental health issues. Parentification is form of abuse so that already makes me doubt how objective you are.\n\nWhy was your relationship bad with all sisters?  If it was about 10 years ago then Beth would be 19 and Kate 21, that's not a big age difference and if you expected help from Kate then why not Beth too? What makes Beth too young and what contribution were you expecting from Kate? Why did your mother included only you in the will and nothing for your sisters? \n\nI'm going to say N.T. A because she willed everything to you, but I think there's more going on.\n\nEDIT: I'm changing it to YTA. Your sister doesn't have to be a caregiver to someone who wasn't there for her. She was 21 and wanted to move out, that's completely normal, you can't expect her to put her life on hold. There's a link between addictions and trauma, your mom's behavior might have affected her way more than you realize.", "\n\n>Around the halfway point of this terrible process Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.\n\nOk...with you so far. \n\n>I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them.\n\nAnd there it is. Your mom *was* abusive. She was neglectful and as someone with anxiety and depression, those are not an excuse to not be there for your children and expect your oldest to do your job for you. And having an unstable parent probably left Kate with some trauma. Did you mom ever apologize?\n\nI know you may think everything turned out fine from your perspective, but that might not be the case for her. A parentified sibling is *NOT* a replacement for an actual parent. And issues that your sister has from your mom sound very very real. \n\n>The lies devastated our mom but eventually she was too far gone to understand.\n\nThey aren't lies from your own words. \n\n\n>but Kate decided it would be a good time to up and move away with her new boyfriend.\n\nThat's 100% reasonable and what a lot of people do at that age. Why is it Kate's responsibility to caretake someone that wasn't there for her in her childhood? Why is it yours? \n\nBoth you and Kate sound like you have trauma stemming from your mother but in your case it seems like you're taking it out on Kate. She didn't step up to be a caretaker to your mother like you did when your sisters were children and you clearly resent her for it. \n\nBut that's not her fault, or yours. It was your mother's. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss and all you went through but it doesn't sound like Kate does have a point. Your mother made some terrible mistakes that affected you and Kate terribly whether you realize it or not. \n\nAnd you being petty about the situation makes me judge, a slight YTA. And only because you need to break out of this toxic mindset that it's ok for parents to absolve themselves of responsibility before or if you have your own kids. \n\nAlso, depending on where you live, she could have a case to get her share. I recommend posting this to r/legaladvice", "YTA. You claim that Kate can't possibly have been abused, but it's telling that all three of your sisters became estranged from your mother before her death. That suggests that perhaps your childhood home was a different place for daughters than it was for you, a son. It's also telling that you think it was appropriate to \"scare away\" the boys who tried to date your sisters. \n\nYes, you should have given Kate her part of the inheritance.

If she wanted a say in how your mother chose to distribute her assets, that was something to discuss while she was still alive. She doesn't get to swan in now and demand anything.", "This is tough because I wouldn\u2019t wanna give her shit either with the way she acts. I\u2019d be livid. However, it technically was your mothers money to give and if she assumed you would distribute it evenly, those were her wishes.", "You did the right thing. I'm sorry you went through this. Being your mother's caretaker is an awful experience. Especially when a sibling isn't. helpful and acts entitled. I took care of my mom, while my sister 14 years older couldn't be bothered. My mom lost her mind and at times thought I was her, I played along because the thought of your child not caring at all about you on our death bed has to be awful and I couldn't do that to her. I paid for everything, went into massive amounts of debt to make sure my mom had a roof over her head. I found out a day before the year anniversary of my mom's death that my sister called her dad and cried that I would not share my mom's \"life insurance\" with her. He sent her money. There was never any life insurance.", "NTA. You are not legally required to give her shit. Talking to my attorney dad that specializes in estates right now. You're definitely protected, especially as long as it's nowhere in writing that she wanted you to split it, but even then her will and other estate planning documents hold more weight than a note.\n\n**ETA** There are provisions in some wills that speak on 'promoting family harmony'. If that is included in her will, there may be a slight edge for Kate to go in on, but it would be a hard case to get to court let alone to win for her.", "If any of it was money through a life insurance policy your sister can pound sand. It doesn\u2019t go through probate but anything that was specific in the will I would consult your moms estate attorney to make sure your sister doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.  My mom had the same expectation, but then when she was in the hospital with cancer, she flat out, told me at one point not to give a single penny to my brother and sister, because they didn\u2019t bother to come and take care of her when she was sick. The only time they would come to see her they would ask her for money.\n\nETA: NTA", "YTA.\n\nWe just have your side of the story. But, in my experience, a mother can be a great mom to one child, and awful to the other. The mom she was to you could not have been the same mom to Katie.\n\nI'd be more charitable if you had just kept it all for yourself, but you decided to spite Katie by giving it all to your other siblings.", "NTA. Inheritance is partly earned by maintaining a good relationship with parents and helping them until their death.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKate not even showing up to the funeral to support her siblings shows her true colors. She doesn't care about any of you, not just mom.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom had a will and left everything to you. You decided to share some of your inheritance with two of your sisters. That was nice of you to do. If you don\u2019t want to give any to your other sister, that\u2019s fine. \n\nIf your mom wanted it another way, she would have written that into the will. \n\nI hope you\u2019re finally able to enjoy your life now after taking care of others for so long.", "NTA\n\nIt seems to me that if your mom wanted her(or any of them for that matter)to have anything it's not hard to express it in the will. You were the sole beneficiary and did what you saw fit", "NTA. Technically it's your inheritance to do with whatever you want. The will only names you, and while there may be an *expectation* of equal distribution, since it wasn't specifically addressed in the will, you're under no obligation to distribute anything equally among all 3 sisters. If Kate doesn't like it, too bad. She wasn't there for all of the hard work you put in taking care of your mother in her final years, so it's really her fault.", "It\u2019s hard to pass judgment because we don\u2019t have Kate\u2019s side of the story. Every child\u2019s relationship with their parent is different, so you can\u2019t say something didn\u2019t happen to your sister just because your personally didn\u2019t witness or experience it.\n\nThat being said, I think people who go NC with their parents shouldn\u2019t expect an inheritance, so you\u2019re NTA for giving your mom\u2019s inheritance to your nieces instead of your sister. But I know nothing about the law, so maybe I\u2019m wrong.", "NTA. The will says what it says. There\u2019s nothing to argue. It\u2019s legally yours. And you\u2019re right. I know people like that. Give them an inch, they\u2019ll try to take your home lol", "NTA. If your mother wanted her to have it she would have specified. I\u2019m guessing she hoped Kate would change and if she did you would split it. Kate deserves nothing.", "the fact ut was made before her illness will make it very hard to contest. OP was effectively the head of the household and she has given him this last chore.", ">You deny any abuse but you were parentified.\n\nSo glad I wasn't the only one who had a \"Hold up...\" moment when I read that. Also, like you mentioned, baffled that the other two sisters were given a free pass even though they were VERY close in age and also didn't actually help with their mother's care, or even see her much even though they were close by. Part of me feels like both OP and his mother tried to force Kate into a motherly role since OP took on the fatherly role, and she just wasn't having it.", "That's what stood out to me too. \n\nI can't help but feel like OP's hatred of Kate comes from the fact that when their mom got sick, Kate moved away instead of staying and helping the person that wasn't there for her during childhood. He probably grew up thinking that taking all responsibility even those that wasn't his is always the \"right\" thing to do. And people who don't are evil and selfish. When in reality, the only selfish one is probably the mother.", "Yes, thank you. That was also what I thought.", "If the will had said to divide it equally, we would not be having this discussion. OP states that it did not and a lawyer has verified this.", "I'm with you. \n\nAlthough I feel for the mum's MH problems, and I admire OP for doing what had to be done, it was a traumatic situation for all the kids. They effectively lost their parent when they were very young even though she was technically still around. \n\nOP dealt with that in one way, his siblings in another way. But they all suffered. \n\nForcing OP to now be the ONLY family authority figure when it comes to distributing the inheritance is, to me, one last awful choice the mum made. Edit: I mean by abdicating responsibility yet again. \n\nMoney is the one way that the mum can care for her kids now, give Kate her share. All those people have earned it.", "According to the will, which is all that actually matters, there is no inheritance for Kate. \n\nThe mom intentionally wrote the will so only OP inherits, with OP being responsible to decide how to divide things up, if he decides to do so. \n\nClearly there was a reason why the mom structured things this way, otherwise her will would have simply split the inheritance.", "By face value the mother was neglecting her childrens' needs and hence abusive. There's the clear reason why the three distance themselves.", "Nta your mom gave it to you and your giving it to the other siblings. Kate doesn\u2019t get to show up at the end with her hands open. Your mom very well could have been abusive. It doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes to splitting the money", "OP, im very sorry for your loss may and your sisters find strength in each other on this difficult time but i have to tell you this\u2026 \n\nDO NOT GIVE UP NOW! Kate deserves nothing! your mom wanted all of her kids and that\u2019s probably the reason she called Kate\u2019s name before passing \u2026 because she wasn\u2019t there and deep down your mom knew it.\n\nKate came all the way down for money but didn\u2019t want to on the last day your mom was alive and that alone explains what kind of woman she is. \n\nAlso you (and your family who sound ridiculous for telling you to giver her money) think that your mom still wanted Kate to have money\u2026 but did she told you that after she wrote the will or in her last days (even by other words) because this will you told us about shows me the opposite of what everyone thinks \n\nNTA!", "Could you put some money in a trust for Kate's possible future kids or something perhaps? Edit: and NOT tell her. They get it at 18.", "It might be legally fine but you knew the spirit of your mother's wishes and you're taking advantage to take it out on a relative you dislike. Valid feelings or not I think you're the AH for that.", "I don't know about that. Op says he stepped up as a kid,  he was 26 ten years ago, so definitely no kid. \n\nThe way I'm reading it is that OP's mom struggled with depression and anxiety during their childhood and then got seriously sick about ten years ago with different disease. I could be wrong though, it's not very clearly written.", ">I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties\n\nOP is pretty explicit that they were a kid when this happened.", "[deleted]", "Our mom was a single mother who worked herself to death. I took over a lot of the household/parent responsibilities out of necessity. My sisters never cleaned, never cooked, and never worked once. The younger two did eventually grow up and start contributing, but Kate refused. Our mom paid for her rehab over and over. Anytime Kate needed or wanted something our mom sent it. We didn't have the easiest childhood, but our mom loved us more than anything. She went hungry just to see us eat.", "NTA, but honestly, I would have some of the money in an education trust for your mother's bio and legally adopted grandkids with some cavaets to make sure the money goes to secondary education (college, trade school) and/or downpayments for homes or something like that. These can be structured so that the kid or the parents can't get the money directly and spend in other ways.\n\nIt protects the kids money (you may trust your sisters, but things happen, money makes people crazy and you may not trust their husbands) and it gives a fighting chance to any kids your black-sheep sister might pop-out in the future to make a better life for themselves b/c it sounds like they will need a leg up.", "Yeah I know. I responded to that message.", "There are a lot of things that are legal that are still morally incorrect. I\u2019m sure OP followed some interpretation of the will. She\u2019s still the AH.", "TBF\n\nAs a full-time caregiver mum knew OP sacrificed a career and family of his own to look after siblings. And her.\n\nThis is in fact his back-pay in  wages.  OP was kind to share with siblingswhen he didn't have to.", "Yup. Sometimes life sucks, for Kate. NTA.", "Yes, the \"stepped up as a kid\" and \"It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them\" makes it pretty clear that this is more than 10 years ago (when only his youngest sister was under 18).", "It appears you did not read the entire post.\n\nWe're (clearly) not talking about OP choosing, at the age of 26, to play the role of caretaker for his mother.\n\nWe're talking about OP telling us all about how while he was still, and I quote, a \"kid,\" he was playing the role of father for his siblings. And apparently a strong parental role in general due to his mother's mental health struggles. OP literally says in the post that he had to step up as a child to take on lots of parental duties. That's the very definition of parentification.", "It's not \"some interpretation\". The will is a legal instrument that the mom intentionally and specifically wrote to only grant OP inheritance. \n\nThat was a deliberate choice by the mom, who could have just as easily drafted the will to grant inheritance to everyone. \n\nKate abandoned their mother on her deathbed, skipped the funeral, then strode into town demanding a house. \n\nI see nothing morally objectionable, given all these facts, on not giving Kate something she has no legal claim to.", "People don\u2019t \u201cabandon\u201d their parents without a valid reason. Sounds like OP\u2019s mother may have set OP up to look like the AH then, when in fact she probably was. OP still didn\u2019t have to play into it. I can see why her sister doesn\u2019t come around.", "Yes they do. Really? People do all kinds of terrible things, including abandoning family members, without what any reasonable person would consider a \"valid reason\".\n\nPeople do selfish, terrible things all of the time.", "I have many many times seen people be scapegoated by horrible families who then think they are getting another dig in by screwing someone over on the inheritance. In reality, I\u2019m sure her sister couldn\u2019t care less about the money and is happy to be rid of these awful people. Probably the best choice she ever made. \n\nOP is asking if she\u2019s the AH because she knows she is and wants to know if she has been too obvious in her greed. Apparently she hasn\u2019t been and can socially get away with treating her sister badly. But you can\u2019t put a price on her sister\u2019s peace.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  She said she was abused, and this most recent form of abuse is consistent with her story. \n\nThe fact that this is even a post proves the kind of people OP and her family are (ie. Did I go to far in being a jerk? No one has called me on it yet and I just want to make sure \ud83d\ude44). The purpose of an inheritance is to transfer wealth to the next generation. Not to reward golden children and further abuse scapegoated children financially."]}
