{"id": 20982, "submission_id": "14n1lyt", "title": "AITA for giving my sister's inheritance to our other siblings and their kids?", "selftext": "I (36M) have three younger sisters named Kate (31F), Beth (29F), and Meg (26F). Our mom got sick around 10 years ago and I was forced to become a caregiver. She progressively got worse over the course of a decade. I was only 26 when this initially happened. Beth and Meg were too young to expect them to contribute, but Kate decided it would be a good time to up and move away with her new boyfriend.\n\nAs our mom\u2019s health declined she repeatedly asked for her daughters. She forgot my face but called the names of her other children who didn\u2019t even come visit. Beth and Meg were unhelpful, but they still made an effort to come see her (though rarely).\n\nAround the halfway point of this terrible process Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Our mom was fragile and definitely had issues (she struggled with severte depression and anxiety) but she never mistreated us. I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them.\n\nThe lies devastated our mom but eventually she was too far gone to understand. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone. It was just in her nature to forgive, especially if it was her children. I\u2019m sure that if she had been all there she still would have wanted nothing more than to see her daughter.\n\nMy relationship with all three of my sisters deteriorated, but Kate took the cake. She\u2019d call out of the blue asking for money yet never asked how our dying mom was doing.Our mom passed peacefully in her sleep. I think seeing the state she was in sobered Beth and Meg. They apologized and sat beside our mom in her final hours. All three of us cried together, but only one name left my mom\u2019s mouth: \u2018Kate.\u2019\n\nKate skipped our mom\u2019s funeral. She came riding into town with a complete stranger expecting her inheritance. My mom wrote a will before things went downhill that left everything to me with the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d distribute it all equally. No one else was mentioned or specified. I divided things up between Beth, Meg and I. Their children also got something to help pay for college or whatever they decide to pursue after high school. The physical items were divvied up between family.\n\nMy sister threatened legal action over it. She said she was owed a certain amount from our mother\u2019s estate and that she wanted the old family house. I told her that she\u2019s owed absolutely nothing and to enjoy living in whatever shithole she crawled out of. Anything she\u2019s given will be spent on drugs and stupid shit like lottery tickets. I won\u2019t fund that when it could go to helping my nieces attend college or give them something to lean on after turning 18.\n\nOur extended family are picking sides and saying I\u2019m being petty. They said my mother would want Kate to have the money, but I know that if she got even a penny from me she\u2019d see it as an opportunity to squeeze me for all I have. She's not getting anything, even when I'm old and senile.\n\nEdit: It was not put into writing that I need to divide everything equally. I am the only inheritor listed on the will. My mom did hope that would be the outcome but understood that there might be circumstances which complicate things down the line.\n\nEdit, again: Our mom was a single mother. She sacrificed so much to provide for us. She worked long hours and held multiple jobs to make ends meet. There were many nights she went hungry just so we could eat. She never laid a hand on any of us. I honestly can't even remember a time when she yelled at us - she was very kind natured and nonconfrontational. If anything, she was too easy on us and we lacked structure. I had to start working early to help pay the bills. My sisters didn't contribute at all. Kate lived off our mom until she moved away. She never finished high school, wasted thousands on rehab and never attended college. Even after leaving she still asked for tons of favors and ridiculous things. Our mom never denied her anything. I know for a fact that I won\u2019t be giving Kate money directly given the state she\u2019s in now, but I'm going to set up something up for of any future children she may have. My mom prayed and hoped for a day where all of her kids got along and things were easy. I hope that day comes too. \n\nMost of this inheritance money is from our mom's dad. She was his only child and everything was left to her. House, cars, everything. The house was sold off for quite a lot. The total outcome was a life-changing amount of money. He had investments as well which took care of us. Most of it has been sitting untouched and adding up because we never really changed our lifestyle. My job also pays well so we've really just been sitting on it. Some of it was spent on medical expenses that insurance couldn't cover or other family emerrgencies like Kate's rehab. There's enough that my neices (3, 4 and 6) won't have to pay out of pocket for college.

I'm curious about Kate's side of the story. You deny your mother was abusive and immediately say that you had to play parent to your sisters because your mom couldn't for whatever mental health issues. Parentification is form of abuse so that already makes me doubt how objective you are.\n\nWhy was your relationship bad with all sisters?  If it was about 10 years ago then Beth would be 19 and Kate 21, that's not a big age difference and if you expected help from Kate then why not Beth too? What makes Beth too young and what contribution were you expecting from Kate? Why did your mother included only you in the will and nothing for your sisters? \n\nI'm going to say N.T. A because she willed everything to you, but I think there's more going on.\n\nEDIT: I'm changing it to YTA. Your sister doesn't have to be a caregiver to someone who wasn't there for her. She was 21 and wanted to move out, that's completely normal, you can't expect her to put her life on hold. There's a link between addictions and trauma, your mom's behavior might have affected her way more than you realize.", "\n\n>Around the halfway point of this terrible process Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.\n\nOk...with you so far. \n\n>I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them.\n\nAnd there it is. Your mom *was* abusive. She was neglectful and as someone with anxiety and depression, those are not an excuse to not be there for your children and expect your oldest to do your job for you. And having an unstable parent probably left Kate with some trauma. Did you mom ever apologize?\n\nI know you may think everything turned out fine from your perspective, but that might not be the case for her. A parentified sibling is *NOT* a replacement for an actual parent. And issues that your sister has from your mom sound very very real. \n\n>The lies devastated our mom but eventually she was too far gone to understand.\n\nThey aren't lies from your own words. \n\n\n>but Kate decided it would be a good time to up and move away with her new boyfriend.\n\nThat's 100% reasonable and what a lot of people do at that age. Why is it Kate's responsibility to caretake someone that wasn't there for her in her childhood? Why is it yours? \n\nBoth you and Kate sound like you have trauma stemming from your mother but in your case it seems like you're taking it out on Kate. She didn't step up to be a caretaker to your mother like you did when your sisters were children and you clearly resent her for it. \n\nBut that's not her fault, or yours. It was your mother's. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss and all you went through but it doesn't sound like Kate does have a point. Your mother made some terrible mistakes that affected you and Kate terribly whether you realize it or not. \n\nAnd you being petty about the situation makes me judge, a slight YTA. And only because you need to break out of this toxic mindset that it's ok for parents to absolve themselves of responsibility before or if you have your own kids. \n\nAlso, depending on where you live, she could have a case to get her share. I recommend posting this to r/legaladvice", "YTA. You claim that Kate can't possibly have been abused, but it's telling that all three of your sisters became estranged from your mother before her death.

Who knows. \n\nI do think Kate (or any child) should not expect an inheritance when she didn't maintain a relationship with her mother. She chose to leave at adulthood, and did not participate in family life. I don't think she is owed a piece of the estate.\n\nParents who care about their children should write clear wills to prevent this kind of squabbling!

There are definite signs that OP might not be a reliable narrator.", "YES to all of this.  thank you for saying this.  the abuse may not have been physical, but emotional.  additionally, sometimes a parent will abuse one child but not the other(s).  if OP was parentified, he was probably too busy trying to please mom and make her proud (and therefore receive validation) to see/hear any abuse that may have been happening.  kate struggles with addiction, and abuse and lack of connection is a strong factor in addiction.  also, i'm guessing that OP's mom wrote the will that way not only because he's the oldest, but because he's male and she's putting the traditional male role on him, which would make sense if she parentified him.  lots of speculation of course, but it's just what i read between the lines.", "im so glad im not the only who picked up on that. the moment op statted about taking care of the sisters i stopped reading cuz im absolutely dumbfounded.", "Parentification is abuse.", "I disagree with you.", "Are you a teenage?

It is not uncommon for an abusive parent to have one scapegoat child that bears the brunt. It is entirely possible that their mother was abusive towards Kate and that played a big role in why she refused to \"step up\".

She probably won\u2019t even go through that legal battle because she can\u2019t afford it, but will continue to harass OP for money all his life thinking she\u2019s entitled to something. It\u2019s entirely up to OP to do what he wants with the money and if the mom had wanted to leave something she would\u2019ve made a different will. I think OP has his reasons to exclude and it seems reasonable to at least make sure his younger family members are taken cared of with the imaginary portion that could\u2019ve gone to Kate.

It sounds very much like you hate your sister because she refused to be subjected to the same abuse. The conditions at home you describe sound like the perfect melting pot for a traumatic and abusive childhood. How often was Kate gilted for not becoming the family's new mom? How often was nothing she did good enough because she wasn't taking care of the family? How often were your struggles her fault because you had to be a single dad instead of being a mom and dad with her? The sisters you do like didn't even want much to do with mom. Evidently, that was not a very good household to be in a child.\n\nI doubt your mom meant it, but mental illness is not an excuse for abuse, and just because Kate never had a hand laid on her doesn't mean she wasn't abused.\n\nAs for the inheritance issue. I don't think you should give anything to Kate. Not because of anything that happened during your childhood, you're an asshole for holding Kate to a higher standard than your other sisters. You shouldn't give her anything because she's decided to cope with her traumatic upbringing by turning to drugs. Giving a practicing addict a large sum of money is never a good idea. Personally, I'd put her share of it aside until such time as she's cleaned herself up. If she doesn't, keep that share for any kids she might have. If she doesn't then it's up for grabs.\n\nThough I don't think paying for rehab would be out of line.\n\nI guess the question becomes do you want to be right or do you want to have a relationship with your sister? It may not be too late. Your right not to give her the money, you're an asshole for literally every other word you've said about her.

You don't know. She may have been the kindest and sweetest mom to you, but you'll never know what went down between mom and Kate when you weren't there. Or maybe you were just blind to it, that happens too.\n\nMaybe the reason Kate needed rehab was because she felt she needed drugs to take her out whatever misery your mom was putting her through?\n\nI thought my grandmother was the sweetest person, until after she died, and my mom started telling me about her own childhood. In retrospect, I wouldn't have guessed, and couldn't have known, but I don't have any reasons to doubt my mom either.\n\nSo I think you should rethink your relationship to Kate, and ask her to elaborate on what happened.", "NTA\n\nI'm surprised you were as charitable as you were already.

I was at the initial part of the post going to lightly say that you can\u2019t right Kate\u2019s narrative on what she considered abusive but honestly with all the context provided I think you\u2019re probably right there too. It sounds like Kate for whatever the reasons were, decided she would rather live her life as she saw fit and fell into drugs and a bad lifestyle. Perhaps for Kate your mother lacked things she felt she needed for her mom but it certainly sounds like your mom did her best despite her situation.\n\nKate did nothing to help. And while I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have admonished her for not putting her life on hold, it sounds like she didn\u2019t care to try and wanted to spin the situation to make it look like she was in the right to do so, and then come back prowling for money when she saw an opportunity.\n\nTough shit Kate. I think if you have some money left and decided you felt guilty not helping Kate out with it the ONLY thing that would be semi reasonable would be to tell Kate you are willing to spend a portion on her going to rehab, and that you will set aside a portion for her if she stays clean for a long enough period of time that you feel she is clean and can use it wisely.

To me it doesn't seem like Beth and Meg were too young to contribute to taking care of their mom in any meaningful way. Yet, OP's resentment against Kate shows and he blames only Kate, as if she was his only option for help. Kate had a right to live her life outside of her family home at that age. Yet OP talks as if she did something wrong by starting her own life.\n\nAlso according to OP, the other sisters were unhelpful too and didn't come to visit either, not just Kate (then he says they came \"rarely\"). Also, from these remarks it shows that they also left after Kate, but OP doesn't blame them for leaving.\n\nThen OP says Kate began to tell their mother was abusive, but he doesn't specify if she said the mom was abusive to her, or to all of her children. If it was just about her, OP cannot with confidence say their mother did not mistreat her. That is something Kate would know, not him. And OP does say the mom had issues with severe depression and anxiety. Also it seems strange that all three daughters were cold to her. Maybe the son got a better treatment from the mother?\n\nI also found it weird that the mom left everything to the son 10 YEARS AGO. As i understand, that was just at the beginning of her illness? So she couldn't have had any resentment for her daughters for not taking care of her when she was ill. Yet she excluded all the daughters from the will and left the decision to the son. Why would she do that? Why put all the daughters in a position where they had to be in the good graces of her boy to get any inheritence at all?\n\nOP's relationship with his sisters seems weird too. He was \"scaring off the boys trying to date them\"? (Notice how he doesn't say \"trying to bother them, harass them\" etc. Apparently he forbid dating to his sisters.) Taking them to \"father/daughter\" events? He is only 5 years older than Kate, but apparently tried to act like a very controlling father to them, instead of an older brother. Kate, being the oldest of the sisters, must have resisted this more than the others. Maybe why OP is so resentful of her than the others?\n\nAlso, even if the mom left everything to the boy, she did make it clear that she wanted OP to distribute it equally, and as i understand she never changed that stance. So isn't OP going against the will of the mom, by denying Kate of her inheritence?\n\nAlso, OP seems like he is still controlling to his sisters, thinking he has a right to tell them how they should spend the inheritence.\n\nSome things seem fishy here.", "Unfortunately, in a lot of states a child being left out of the will entirely is grounds to challenge it.", "Except they weren\u2019t. when his mom got sick decided to help his sick mother raise his younger siblings because he knew what she was going throw even then it wasn\u2019t Kate been parentified", "I was thinking this too.

In many cultures around the world the first born son is treated so much better than any daughters, especially younger ones, and given more privileges disguised as rewards or waved away if called out. Abuse isn't just physical. \n\nAlso, when you look at it in a certain way, OPs logic fails a bit. He's so angry at his sister for not going along with the mothers wishes to see her, and this is seen by OP as a very serious offense, so he's going to punish her by not going along with the mothers wishes that money be distributed equally?

The other siblings dealt with it well??(I guess but it seems they weren't really involved either until the end of her life) but Kate obviously didn't handle it well at all. She's the Blacksheep, the raisin in the oatmeal, the druggie.\n\nJust because Op loved mom and saw the positives of their situation that doesn't mean Kate could.

Plus, odd that ALL the daughters were distant from her....hmmm...", "A parent working so much that they're not around may technically be neglectful, but sometimes there isn't any choice. It might be more neglectful to be around more but get evicted. Our wonderful economic system make this a reality for many families.", "Hopefully, I might be able to provide some perspective. I had a similar upbringing, although I only have 1 younger sister. Single mother, grew up poor, took on the \"man of the house\" role. If OP is Latino, this actually isn't uncommon (unfortunately). I won't get too political about it, but a lot of us have had our fathers deported, leaving us in these weird situations. I won't assume that's the case he, of course, but certain cultures may make this more plausible. \n\nGiven their ages, I think the will was a logical choice by the mother, rather than an emotional one. Given their ages, it seems like the only child in a position to inherit or handle the estate (at the time) was OP. Like you said, Kate was 21 and the oldest girl. Given his description of Kate, she may have seemed irresponsible at the time. Mother may have felt son would do what needed to be done. The other girls would be younger, making it more likely to rely on OP. Especially if there was a system in place where mom overrelied on OP. \n\nI see your point on OP being rough on Kate. There's definitely some animosity there, but if she didn't visit her mom while sick, deathbed, or funeral... I can't say I'd have the mentality to just let it go. I'd be furious, too. That's not including the coming to town after to claim an inheritance. \n\nKate also appears to be the black sheep of the family. No college education, family of her own, drug issues, etc. It seem everyone else is stable, but Kate isn't. Could OP be exaggerating? Sure. But if he isn't, she could potentially hurt herself and OD with a large sum. I can understand most redditors having the view of being allowed the freedom to do what they want, but if the money is instead being used to help moms grandchildren, rather than being wasted... I can't say I disagree. If OP were to take it because of just not liking her, yeah, I'll take your side on the inheritance part. \n\nI don't think this is fishy per se. I think more perspective would help, but on its merits, I'd still say it's valid. Mom also likely recently passed away, so OP might be in the anger stage of grief. Might want to give him some benefit of the doubt if he's angrily writing his post.", "So many red flags, you absolutely nailed it. The fact that OP dismisses his sisters\u2019 experiences with their mother is enough for me to say he\u2019s TA. All 3 sisters pulled away from their mother the second they got a chance to. Is that not odd to OP? That screams to me there is so much more to the story, no child would try to ghost their sick parent unless there was some form of abuse - mental or physical that happened.", "I have seen a lot of patriarchal type families set up wills in this way, tying the inheritance to a male family member with the idea that he'll distribute it to the others. Of course it ends up tying everyone else to him if they want to see any of it. \n\nNot saying OP necessarily owes anyone anything, but it's an unfair way to set up an inheritance and I think it speaks to what the family dynamic was like.", "So glad I'm not the only one seeing this. I do not believe this man whatsoever.", "This.", "That's OK.", "To scare off their boyfriends", "Op says mom couldn\u2019t even recognize him at the end.
