{"id": 20982, "submission_id": "14n1lyt", "title": "AITA for giving my sister's inheritance to our other siblings and their kids?", "selftext": "I (36M) have three younger sisters named Kate (31F), Beth (29F), and Meg (26F). Our mom got sick around 10 years ago and I was forced to become a caregiver. She progressively got worse over the course of a decade. I was only 26 when this initially happened. Beth and Meg were too young to expect them to contribute, but Kate decided it would be a good time to up and move away with her new boyfriend.\n\nAs our mom\u2019s health declined she repeatedly asked for her daughters. She forgot my face but called the names of her other children who didn\u2019t even come visit. Beth and Meg were unhelpful, but they still made an effort to come see her (though rarely).\n\nAround the halfway point of this terrible process Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Our mom was fragile and definitely had issues (she struggled with severte depression and anxiety) but she never mistreated us. I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them.\n\nThe lies devastated our mom but eventually she was too far gone to understand. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone. It was just in her nature to forgive, especially if it was her children. I\u2019m sure that if she had been all there she still would have wanted nothing more than to see her daughter.\n\nMy relationship with all three of my sisters deteriorated, but Kate took the cake. She\u2019d call out of the blue asking for money yet never asked how our dying mom was doing.Our mom passed peacefully in her sleep. I think seeing the state she was in sobered Beth and Meg. They apologized and sat beside our mom in her final hours. All three of us cried together, but only one name left my mom\u2019s mouth: \u2018Kate.\u2019\n\nKate skipped our mom\u2019s funeral. She came riding into town with a complete stranger expecting her inheritance. My mom wrote a will before things went downhill that left everything to me with the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d distribute it all equally. No one else was mentioned or specified. I divided things up between Beth, Meg and I. Their children also got something to help pay for college or whatever they decide to pursue after high school. The physical items were divvied up between family.\n\nMy sister threatened legal action over it. She said she was owed a certain amount from our mother\u2019s estate and that she wanted the old family house. I told her that she\u2019s owed absolutely nothing and to enjoy living in whatever shithole she crawled out of. Anything she\u2019s given will be spent on drugs and stupid shit like lottery tickets. I won\u2019t fund that when it could go to helping my nieces attend college or give them something to lean on after turning 18.\n\nOur extended family are picking sides and saying I\u2019m being petty. They said my mother would want Kate to have the money, but I know that if she got even a penny from me she\u2019d see it as an opportunity to squeeze me for all I have. She's not getting anything, even when I'm old and senile.\n\nEdit: It was not put into writing that I need to divide everything equally. I am the only inheritor listed on the will. My mom did hope that would be the outcome but understood that there might be circumstances which complicate things down the line.\n\nEdit, again: Our mom was a single mother. She sacrificed so much to provide for us. She worked long hours and held multiple jobs to make ends meet. There were many nights she went hungry just so we could eat. She never laid a hand on any of us. I honestly can't even remember a time when she yelled at us - she was very kind natured and nonconfrontational. If anything, she was too easy on us and we lacked structure. I had to start working early to help pay the bills. My sisters didn't contribute at all. Kate lived off our mom until she moved away. She never finished high school, wasted thousands on rehab and never attended college. Even after leaving she still asked for tons of favors and ridiculous things. Our mom never denied her anything. I know for a fact that I won\u2019t be giving Kate money directly given the state she\u2019s in now, but I'm going to set up something up for of any future children she may have. My mom prayed and hoped for a day where all of her kids got along and things were easy. I hope that day comes too.

I'm curious about Kate's side of the story. You deny your mother was abusive and immediately say that you had to play parent to your sisters because your mom couldn't for whatever mental health issues. Parentification is form of abuse so that already makes me doubt how objective you are.\n\nWhy was your relationship bad with all sisters?  If it was about 10 years ago then Beth would be 19 and Kate 21, that's not a big age difference and if you expected help from Kate then why not Beth too? What makes Beth too young and what contribution were you expecting from Kate? Why did your mother included only you in the will and nothing for your sisters? \n\nI'm going to say N.T. A because she willed everything to you, but I think there's more going on.\n\nEDIT: I'm changing it to YTA. Your sister doesn't have to be a caregiver to someone who wasn't there for her. She was 21 and wanted to move out, that's completely normal, you can't expect her to put her life on hold. There's a link between addictions and trauma, your mom's behavior might have affected her way more than you realize.", "\n\n>Around the halfway point of this terrible process Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.\n\nOk...with you so far. \n\n>I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them.\n\nAnd there it is. Your mom *was* abusive. She was neglectful and as someone with anxiety and depression, those are not an excuse to not be there for your children and expect your oldest to do your job for you. And having an unstable parent probably left Kate with some trauma. Did you mom ever apologize?\n\nI know you may think everything turned out fine from your perspective, but that might not be the case for her. A parentified sibling is *NOT* a replacement for an actual parent. And issues that your sister has from your mom sound very very real. \n\n>The lies devastated our mom but eventually she was too far gone to understand.\n\nThey aren't lies from your own words. \n\n\n>but Kate decided it would be a good time to up and move away with her new boyfriend.\n\nThat's 100% reasonable and what a lot of people do at that age. Why is it Kate's responsibility to caretake someone that wasn't there for her in her childhood? Why is it yours? \n\nBoth you and Kate sound like you have trauma stemming from your mother but in your case it seems like you're taking it out on Kate. She didn't step up to be a caretaker to your mother like you did when your sisters were children and you clearly resent her for it. \n\nBut that's not her fault, or yours. It was your mother's. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss and all you went through but it doesn't sound like Kate does have a point. Your mother made some terrible mistakes that affected you and Kate terribly whether you realize it or not. \n\nAnd you being petty about the situation makes me judge, a slight YTA. And only because you need to break out of this toxic mindset that it's ok for parents to absolve themselves of responsibility before or if you have your own kids. \n\nAlso, depending on where you live, she could have a case to get her share. I recommend posting this to r/legaladvice", "YTA. You claim that Kate can't possibly have been abused, but it's telling that all three of your sisters became estranged from your mother before her death.

There are definite signs that OP might not be a reliable narrator.", "YES to all of this.  thank you for saying this.  the abuse may not have been physical, but emotional.  additionally, sometimes a parent will abuse one child but not the other(s).  if OP was parentified, he was probably too busy trying to please mom and make her proud (and therefore receive validation) to see/hear any abuse that may have been happening.  kate struggles with addiction, and abuse and lack of connection is a strong factor in addiction.  also, i'm guessing that OP's mom wrote the will that way not only because he's the oldest, but because he's male and she's putting the traditional male role on him, which would make sense if she parentified him.  lots of speculation of course, but it's just what i read between the lines.", "im so glad im not the only who picked up on that. the moment op statted about taking care of the sisters i stopped reading cuz im absolutely dumbfounded.", "Parentification is abuse.", "I disagree with you.", "Are you a teenage?

It\u2019s no one\u2019s business what she does with the money ultimately even though you would like to see it not pissed away. YTA because you\u2019re not doing what your dying mother asked for. \n\nThe correct action to take would be to put her share in a trust which she can\u2019t access until she\u2019s getting the treatment she needs.

Oh! And the family home! \nOf course ... That sounds reasonable.", "It makes you wonder if part of the abuse was leaving OP in charge", "Abusive parents are often worse to same gender children. Fathers will target sons and mothers will target daughters. A woman who fawns over her son might terrorize her daughter over her appearance etc. \n\nIn this situation I could see Kate being angry at the mother's attempt to parentify her, while OP leaned into it, for his own reasons They just had different trauma reactions. And instead of analyzing the family system, which would be too painful and involve accepting that his mother harmed them all, he scapegoats Kate. Now he has a chance to punish her with the inheritance.", "It was one last action to abdicate responsibility and parentify OP.", "Well, the will is what someone chooses to do with their estate. She is entitled to nothing unless the poster is feeling generous and believes she deserves anything. And since she doesn't, she's entitled to NOTHING.", "What is an inheritance then?

Never reward these kinds of people.", "Yeah im kind of grossed out that op doesnt seem to care about hearing his sisters side of the story at all. Hes basically just concluded that shes lying because mom never abused him.", "The impression I get is that OP is bitter that Kate refused to be parentified while he allowed himself to be, and instead of resenting his mother for putting them in that position in the first place, he resents Kate for \"not stepping up\" to fill the mother role. \n\nFurther, his resentment towards Kate is tainting his view of her abuse claims. It is not uncommon for an abusive parent to have one scapegoat child that bears the brunt. It is entirely possible that their mother was abusive towards Kate and that played a big role in why she refused to \"step up\". It would also go a long way toward explaining Kate's instability and addiction issues.", "The mom's wishes were for him to decide. If that wasn't correct, she would have left it evenly to all 4 kids.", "I can't believe Kate has the guts to come to town hoping for money when she has done absolutely nothing to help you and hasn't even visited her dead mother. fuck him", "It couldn't hurt to consult a lawyer, just to be safe. This is, probably, a very cut and dry case, but if Kate does bring legal action, OP should probably have a lawyer on his side.", "\"That's it and that's all\" - exactly!

NTA", "Exactly, let Kate waste the little money she has to try to get a lawyer to challenge the will, it didn\u2019t leave her out, it was executed as stated. She probably won\u2019t even go through that legal battle because she can\u2019t afford it, but will continue to harass OP for money all his life thinking she\u2019s entitled to something. It\u2019s entirely up to OP to do what he wants with the money and if the mom had wanted to leave something she would\u2019ve made a different will. I think OP has his reasons to exclude and it seems reasonable to at least make sure his younger family members are taken cared of with the imaginary portion that could\u2019ve gone to Kate. It went to family, it\u2019s not like OP kept everything to himself and Kate should\u2019ve at least sucked up to the mom and OP in the final days if she expected to get anything.", "Did you speak to a lawyer in regard how Kate could take you to court on the basis that she was forgotten?

But Beth is totally forgiven. I feel there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye. Kate has problems. OP was forced to be a parent. Maybe Kate was difficult as a youngster and not equipped to deal. It all sucks. It\u2019s unfortunate.", "I was abused and neglected as a child but because it wasn\u2019t physical or sexual I always thought it wasn\u2019t actually abuse. I was well into adulthood when I came to terms with the fact that what happened to me was abusive. \n\nAlso, sometimes scapegoating happens where only one child is abused. OP was definitely abused and neglected, but even if he wasn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t mean his sister wasn\u2019t.\n\nEdit: my mother was also mentally ill. Just because that was the catalyst doesn\u2019t make the behavior any less abusive.", "I was at 'hold up' the moment OP denied the abuse and talked about his mother like she was a complete saint. \n\nNot saying it's definitive, but man oh man, the patterns in dysfunctional families.....they're all the same.", "I completely agree! I was also the parentified older sibling and I sacrificed everything for my mom for so long until I finally read a book and learned about other more subtle forms of abuse that are equally damaging. I put my life on hold for 10 years to care for a mentally I\u2019ll mother and be there for my youngest sister who was still in grade school and attempted suicide. I had to go through a phase where I was so angry that I wasn\u2019t able to live my own life and had years and my childhood robbed from me. Now that I\u2019ve put healthy distance and made a healthier relationship with boundaries with my family and stopped being codependent, things are great and I have no regrets but I really feel for OP because he has no idea the harm that was done to him and he\u2019s just pushing forward in codependency. I have so much sympathy for the black sheep sister who couldn\u2019t weather the storm and now she has no inheritance and she is being rejected by her own family on top of everything else.", "If you can\u2019t be there for your kids emotionally, the very least you can do is help them have a leg up in life with the assets you\u2019re leaving behind. As a parent you accept the responsibility to love your child and support them unconditionally. If you\u2019re not prepared to do that, don\u2019t have kids.", "Exactly. She could have at least shown up to show her final respects and refused to do that. OP said the mom repeatedly paid for Kate's rehab, so basically she already got her 'share'. She wanted nothing to do with her mom, so she should want nothing to do with her house and money.", "In our house us 3 girls were abused (grandfather) while our 1 brother was not. He had no idea about the abuse even though our mom, dad, grandmother, and all 3 of us knew it was happening to each other years earlier. When I told him about a year ago he was shocked and sickened.

That's what family is *supposed* to do.", "That\u2019s true. But she isn\u2019t behaving in an entitled manner.

At 26, OP had the choice of saying No. it\u2019s not like he was raised to be his mothers caregiver\u2026 unless I\u2019m seriously missing something.", "When our grandpa died he left our mom everything, plus she sold his house. It was inherited not long before she got sick. Most of it sat untouched for years except for expenses like rehab or emergencies.", "Honestly good question", "The only plausible answer is a slam dunk life insurance policy.", "That's another thing that stands out to me. Where did she get all that money to pass down to her children and grandchildren if her youngest was only 16 when she got sick and OP had to take care of her? Presumably she wasn't working if she needed to be cared for. So why did her children need to work to support the family if she had all this money sitting around somewhere?", "Most addicts I know were abused, too. Their abusive parents definitely didn't pay for their rehab. I had an addict friend steal money from me, and they always claimed they were abused. I definitely got a different story when I met his siblings. Plenty of addicts come from good home situations.", "I have, in fact, I\u2019ve done things that would\u2019ve led to full blown addiction, had I not had parental support I did.  Even as an adult.  I\u2019ve seen it stem from something as simple as being put on a medication by a trusted doctor, due to an injury or something that doctor felt required pain meds and then it completely spinning out of control.  While, there may be many with abusive backgrounds. There\u2019s also many who had loving homes, support, and just got a prescription and spiraled from there.  Let\u2019s not forget back in early 2000\u2019s doctors would hand out opiates like goddamn candy, which truly fuct a lot of people.", "> They had their reasons\n\nThey weren't written down in the will. So they might as well not exist.\n\n> before the dementia\n\nIt was right before the dementia. People have dementia long before they get a diagnosis, so they court could very reasonably conclude she was not in her right mind. \n\n>Eldest son inherting everything is a common practice\n\nNot in America! The presumption here is that every child will inherit, and our laws around it are written with that assumption in mind.\n\n>not prohibited by any statute\n\nStatutes are not our only source of law in this country. Common Law is equally powerful. And judicial discretion is vast in inheritance cases."]}
