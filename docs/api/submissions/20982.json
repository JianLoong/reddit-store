Our mom got sick around 10 years ago and I was forced to become a caregiver. She progressively got worse over the course of a decade. I was only 26 when this initially happened. Beth and Meg were too young to expect them to contribute, but Kate decided it would be a good time to up and move away with her new boyfriend.\n\nAs our mom\u2019s health declined she repeatedly asked for her daughters. She forgot my face but called the names of her other children who didn\u2019t even come visit. Beth and Meg were unhelpful, but they still made an effort to come see her (though rarely).\n\nAround the halfway point of this terrible process Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Our mom was fragile and definitely had issues (she struggled with severte depression and anxiety) but she never mistreated us. I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. It was me who took all my sisters to their father/daughter events and scared off the boys trying to date them.\n\nThe lies devastated our mom but eventually she was too far gone to understand. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone. It was just in her nature to forgive, especially if it was her children. I\u2019m sure that if she had been all there she still would have wanted nothing more than to see her daughter.\n\nMy relationship with all three of my sisters deteriorated, but Kate took the cake. She\u2019d call out of the blue asking for money yet never asked how our dying mom was doing.Our mom passed peacefully in her sleep. I think seeing the state she was in sobered Beth and Meg. They apologized and sat beside our mom in her final hours. All three of us cried together, but only one name left my mom\u2019s mouth: \u2018Kate.\u2019\n\nKate skipped our mom\u2019s funeral. She came riding into town with a complete stranger expecting her inheritance. My mom wrote a will before things went downhill that left everything to me with the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d distribute it all equally. No one else was mentioned or specified. I divided things up between Beth, Meg and I. Their children also got something to help pay for college or whatever they decide to pursue after high school. The physical items were divvied up between family.\n\nMy sister threatened legal action over it. She said she was owed a certain amount from our mother\u2019s estate and that she wanted the old family house. I told her that she\u2019s owed absolutely nothing and to enjoy living in whatever shithole she crawled out of. Anything she\u2019s given will be spent on drugs and stupid shit like lottery tickets. I won\u2019t fund that when it could go to helping my nieces attend college or give them something to lean on after turning 18.\n\nOur extended family are picking sides and saying I\u2019m being petty. They said my mother would want Kate to have the money, but I know that if she got even a penny from me she\u2019d see it as an opportunity to squeeze me for all I have. She's not getting anything, even when I'm old and senile.\n\nEdit: It was not put into writing that I need to divide everything equally. I am the only inheritor listed on the will. My mom did hope that would be the outcome but understood that there might be circumstances which complicate things down the line.", "created_utc": 1688134504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n1lyt/aita_for_giving_my_sisters_inheritance_to_our/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whew. You see some shit and I really didn\u2019t do that much of it bc it was a small part of my job. \n\nShe left the money to you to distribute. Whatever expectation, unless codified, were just words. People say a lot of things. It\u2019s what\u2019s on paper that matters. Many times they do that to not have to make the decision themselves. \n\nI assume when your mother wrote the will she knew your heart wasn\u2019t as forgiving as hers and wrote it that way anyway. That says a lot. \n\nHowever if it does have language saying you distribute it evenly then you\u2019re in trouble and she might be able to take her whole share out of yours. Have you spoken to a lawyer??", "NTA\n\nI feel like you need to seek legal advice", "NTA. Your mom isn't around to say what she wants. I'm assuming the will was made early on before things got really bad. I can't imagine how hard it must have been to see your sister shun and try to use your mom. That being said, any loving mother would know when to cut their child off financially. Don't give away the last of your mother's legacy to fund an addict's dangerous lifestyle. Let it live on and serve her grandchildren.\n\nYou should have a serious discussion with your sister. Tell her why you made the choice you did. Screw the extended family who thinks they have a say. Your mother chose you for a reason. She trusted you to make the right call.

It's a tough call, but that's what I'm saying because this is so one-sided.\n\nIt's obvious from your post that you hate Kate. You deny any abuse but you were parentified. You were cast into a parental role and should have never been required to do that. Also, your other two sisters distanced themselves from you and your mom. So something drove that. You may be right, you may be wrong about the abuse. I'm just a random redditor and I can't make that call based on the info given.", "NTA but a lot will depend on your mother\u2019s will was actually worded and how much leeway you had as executor to make decisions about division of the estate. If your mum did leave it all to you  to distribute as you see fit, then I don\u2019t fault you for doing exactly that!", "NTA. But, I\u2019m wondering if you had the same experience with your mom as a son that your sisters had as daughters. I\u2019m getting some strong misogynistic vibes from your mom (son worships her, daughter says she was abusive). Plus leaving the inheritance to you as the only\nmale relative instead of splitting it evenly. It is worth considering if you and your sister both had very different but equally true experiences with your mom.", "NTA.\n\nI'm taking everything you say at face value so;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone who can't make even a token effort deserves nothing.\n\nAnyone who actively fabricates lies like you've described deserves less than nothing.", ">Kate started telling stories of our mom being abusive. These couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth... I stepped up as a kid to do a lot of the parental duties. \n\nAs people love to say in this sub, parentification is abuse, and this sounds like parentification. So your starting point - Kate is lying, your mother wasn't abusive - strikes me as a bit weak. Since the rest of your argument stems from that, it all becomes iffy.\n\nIt's hard to make a judgement here, but I think I'd lean ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ask those family meme ER\u2019s which niece or nephew should give up their college funds for your sister? Kate is allowed to leave and not help but she\u2019s not free if the consequences of those actions. She inherited nothing. Wills today are written so just because pushed you out doesn\u2019t entitle you to inheritance. I\u2019ve worked with my will and my mothers for years. It\u2019s not like it used to be.

It\u2019s not up to you to decide what your sister does or does not deserve when you know exactly what your mom wanted. Everything else in your story is biased and inflammatory. Especially since she was acting like this *before* your mom got bad. So she knew exactly who Kate was, and still decided she wanted to leave her 1/4 of her assets.

She absolutely can take you to court for this, especially if she wasn\u2019t mentioned in the will.", "YTA State law will determine who gets what. You sister will rightfully sue you.

I\u2019m not saying how you feel is wrong, but knowing what your mom wanted, and explicitly not following through with that is wrong. It sucks, but your mom knew how she was and still wanted her to have something. Everything else is really irrelevant. I\u2019m sorry, truly that you\u2019ve had to go through this. It doesn\u2019t take away that you know what your mom ultimately wanted, and you\u2019re refusing to fulfill her wishes.", "That's why I added she can give her $1. OP should seek legal advice regardless. Kate will not be happy with anything, and will be horrible regardless.", "That would apply if more than one person was listed in the will, but if there is only a single person listed, then it's unlikely the will could be successfully contested", "Not true, unless you only have one child."]}
