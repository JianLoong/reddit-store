As indoctrinated as his family are (esp his grandparents) they are still important to him and helped raise him, so we found a way to compromise and make it work without compromising our morals and friendships.\n\nEdit to add: the wedding was actually really fun and while there were some moments I was like \u2018why did I sign up for this again?\u2019 I am glad we did it. We had a large outside venue and it was a big wedding (~260 people) so there was something for everyone", "What frustrates me about it is that, if those homophobic parents really cared that much about their kids being exposed to gay people, surely having their first experience seeing a gay couple be a close relative would be the perfect way to introduce the kids to \u2018a different kind of person\u2019. But they don\u2019t bc they are much happier to let their children build the narrative that gay people are evil. \n\nFrustrating as hell and OP is defo YTA for allowing this to take place in his own personal ceremony meant to celebrate love.", "My daughters have grown up knowing that love is love. Since they were tiny we taught them that boys can love boys and girls can love girls. Sometimes people are even born into bodies that do not make sense to them and eventually they grow up and change their body; those people might find love too. My daughters know they can love and their parents will support them unless the person they love \u201cis mean.\u201d \n\nChildren learn from those around them and it is sad that those children are likely going to be homophobes.", "I had this exact conversation with my kids when they were 12 and 4, (except it was my friend and her wife). Pretty much the same reaction, although I believe they asked for candy since we were heading into the grocery store. \n\nKids will ask questions about anything unknown, and simple, direct answers usually suffice. It's adults with their weird hangups that complicate shit.", "\u201cMom, why is that woman kissing that man at the alter?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause some people want god to be happy instead of mad when god watches them fuck.\u201d", "I took my 5 yo daughter to my niece's wedding and told her she's marrying her girl friend.  \n\nDaughter says  something to the effect of two girls can't get married. ( not being familiar with anything like that)\n\nI tell her you can marry whoever you want.\n\nNever said  anything after that and she had a great time.", "100%. Kids aren't processing things like that the way adult homophobes do. OP is clearly more OK with homophobia than with the normal signs of affection one might see at a wedding.", "When I told my niece I would be her uncle and a 'he' now, she asked me if I was still going to be 'my (insert nickname here)'\u2014she always called me \"her\" followed by my nickname, like she thought my nickname was a familial role, like instead of saying 'my uncle'. I was choosing a name that had the same sounding nickname, just spelt different (ironically, in a way she always spelt anyway), so I told her yes, and she just said okay and went back to playing.\n\nNo signs of her own identity being influenced by this, and it's been over 10 years since my social transition. She didn't seem confused or like she cared at all. She accepted it easier than my parents did. I think people who claim they're trying to protect children are superimposing their own bigotry (homophobia and transphobia) onto children.\n\nIt's like that quote I saw, something like: we don't care about your children becoming trans or gay, we just hope they have a better support network than we did if they happen to be.", "Pretty sure that's the exact conversation I had with my granddaughter!", "this is terrible parenting. exposing innocent children to paw patrol is immoral.", "It's a really great opportunity to rant and rave and indoctrinate them early.", "I guess not!  Can't upset the bigots, don'tcha know!", "They got divorced. This happens on the \u2018conservative\u2019 side of my family all the time. You can\u2019t throw a rock at a family reunion without hitting some religious nut who\u2019s been divorced from and married to their current spouse at least once before. One of my aunts won\u2019t speak to me anymore because a cousin asked her how long she\u2019d been married and she said, \u201c40 years\u201d and I was all, (teen at the time) \u201cuh-uh, remember, y\u2019all got divorced because everybody found out he was cheating on you (she knew but when my grandma found out and everybody at church knew, that was a deal breaker) and you threw all his shit out the trailer and y\u2019all were separated for like three years and got divorced and it was a whole scandal at your church and everybody treated you like a widow for a year and then y\u2019all started dating again and then you got remarried?\u201d  I mean to tell you. I\u2019m 46 now and just recently she was telling a young newlywed at a family gathering all about how marriage is compromise and her \u2018healed\u2019 marriage is a testament to that and shot me the most poisonous look. And that\u2019s the majority of people on that side\u2014you gotta get married if you even think about sex in the same room as each other, and every standard is absolute so you can\u2019t have conflict at all without breaking off.", "My grandkids have always had Grandpa and Grandpop. Never had to \u201cexplain\u201d anything to them, and they are growing up very well adjusted.  This is their norm.", "Yep, ageism is just another form of nasty bigotry.", "Because they\u2019re homophobic. They want their kids to believe gay people are wrong or evil, and that\u2019s harder when they know gay people.", "Yes the op is participating in the erasure of homosexuals so that his fiance's family can keep living in a fantasy world where gay people don't exist. If they never have to meet one or be friends with one then they can pretend like they are not real people with feelings, and then it is easier to believe that they are evil and bad, and undeserving of the same rights the rest of us share. This is what they are teaching their children.", "And honestly, knowing the fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is conservative and homophobic, how likely are the son and his partner to kiss anyway?  I am very doubtful they will be flaunting physical affection in front of anyone.  Nothing wrong with gat PDA, but I\u2019m guessing they would decide they don\u2019t need the hassle.", "They going to lock their kids in their rooms for life? Wouldn't want them to see animals having sex in public or some other shameful thing.", "Literally!! My kid came home from his first day of gr 1 and said \u201cGuess what?? There\u2019s a girl in my class who has two moms!!\u201d\nAnd I said \u201cCool!\u201d \nEnd of story.", "I explained it exactly the same way to my son 5m. He just said ok cool, can I have a cookie?\n\nThankfully I live in the UK, we're pretty progressive here and lgbt families are common and open for the most part. It must be so hard for lgbt people in other countries/communities.", "I like how you make it appropriate for your children's age.\ud83d\udc4d Of course as they get older, you'll define what \"mean\" actually is so they can identify it and avoid it in their own lives. Well done, parents!", "So divorce is fine but loving who you love isn't? Always so impressed by how accommodating the Bible is that you just get to pick and choose which verses you adhere to.", "Can I just tell you how much I love your teenage response to your aunt. Love the part where you helpfully explained how the uncle\u2019s cheating caused her to throw his crap out of their trailer and it became a huge church scandal!!! \n\nFirst belly laugh I\u2019ve had in what feels like forever and I thank you for that.", "Exactly. People are always like \"when are kids old enough to be taught these things?\" The same age they're \"taught\" about any relationship. Lots of kids grow up with these relationships as the norm in their families.", "They want their kids to see queer folks as not-people.", "Thanks! I\u2019m a nurse so part of my job is helping to educate people in a way that they can understand. I\u2019ve just been trying to use that same approach when it comes to my daughters. I want to do my best so they\u2019re never blindsided in life by something I could have helped them through."]}
