They didn't want to get rid of the original, mostly due to sentimental value as the mother LOVES it.

Specifically, I got a new couch as the original was from the 90s; got new table cloths; got rid of a lot of random furniture covering; and boxed up all the knick-knacks just laying about. I'm talking dozens of random plastic bits that no one knows the origins of, a bowling pin(?), broken ping pong handles, toy parts, so many coasters, so many mugs holding more random bits. I didn't touch any hung photos or other furniture.\n\nHis mother comes by and notices the changes. She's upset.

As long as your partner, who now owns the cabin, is ok with your changes, the ex owner (your MIL) really doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.\n\nThat would be kind of like the people who we bought our house from 10 years ago, knocking on our door and saying they don\u2019t like what we did with the garden, and it needs to be changed back.

The mom is just a visitor now.", "NTA \n\nIt's no longer the \"family\" cabin. They signed it over. Yall are free to discard junk and redecorate as you wish.", "NTA if she wants a muesem for her knick knacks she can get a storage shed", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s a vacation home, not a museum.\n\nIf keeping everything as-is was a condition, she should have let you and DH know in advance so you could decide whether or not to accept the offer.", "NTA. You were supposed to cherish and store their crap forever. Mentally they never stopped thinking of it as \"their\" cabin and junk.\n\nThis is a really common phenomenon among Boomers and leaves them deeply upset and hurt that their children don't want their material possessions and \"treasures\". Not wanting their crap is viewed as a rejection of both them and their values. Millennials meanwhile have little interest in their parents' clutter and dumping their parents junk is the reason that the antique market has absolutely collapsed since the 90's. There's been a ton of news articles on it.", "NTA...Mother needs to face the reality of her decision.  It's not her cabin anymore.

You didn\u2019t throw anything away, so if the items are important to her she should take them to her new place. It\u2019s not fair to give someone something like a cabin and then try and dictate every little thing they do with the place. Sounds like she wanted to keep the place but didn\u2019t want the hassle of the upkeep.", "The need to ask permission was negated when ownership of the cabin went from the mom to your partner. It's kind that you even saved the stuff and offered to let her go through it; you were within rights to pitch anything you guys didn't want.   \n\n\nNTA.", "Do, you don't need to ask permission.  But you probably will always be expected to consider it the family cabin.  This isn't going to end well, trust me.", " \"She tells me that we needed to ask permission.\" - you did, from the owners.

Leaving the cabin as it was probably wasn\u2019t part of the deal.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re paying for the cabin out of your partner\u2019s future inheritance. This was not a gift per se but more like an advance purchase. Even if it was free, it was a gift and you could do as you please\u2014but this makes it worse! You\u2019ve paid, you\u2019re responsible for upkeep, and presumably any other financial issues. MIL needs to let it go.", "Soft YTA. You should have at least seen this problem coming. You might have fuked up your husbands inheritance depending on how pissed off his mom is. Absolutely not worth it.", "Info: did you at least ask your in laws of they wanted anything before getting rid of it?\n\n\n\nIf you decluttered without asking if they wanted anything YTA........", "Slight ESH.  You & your spouse for not giving your MIL and/or other family members a heads up before clearing out what seemed like junk to you but may have been sentimental to others; your MIL for not specifically expressing her vision in advance of the transfer. A bit more communication from the start would've prevented this issue entirely.", "NTA. It\u2019s no longer MIL\u2019s cabin. She can take her stuff with her", "NTA especially since you kept it", "NTA \n\nThis wasn\u2019t even a huge change and you kept the items. \n\nShe can feel upset. She doesn\u2019t get to inflict boundaries she never mentioned during the sale", "NTA\n\nYou did it with the permission of the new owner.", "We purchased my father-in-law's home 4 years ago, he lives full time rent free. We go there for 2 months out of the year as we're still working, and honestly I'm not going to stay more then a couple months when we retire as he is horrible to live with. We want to make improvements to the home (windows ect) as many things are original (f1950s). We paid him the market value for the home . When we go there his dad has a list of everything he wants done and we've done tons of improvements for him that makes his life much more comfortable,  solar panels new wiring, new heat pump etc. But if we make any he doesn't like or approval of he throws a fit and if possible he puts it back after we leave. He also makes improvements we don't want and sends us the bill.  The first couple years he would give away my dishes and cooking items as he didn't use them. After replacing them twice  (asking nicely didn't work) i now have to box everything up and put in our very small room... we let him keep the master.  Now husband won't make improvements that his dad will/does get upset about like a second bathroom and a new kitchen. At this point I wish we never bought the house. I understand it hard to see your house change, advice never buy your parents home while they are alive. It's a nightmare. Sorry it won't get better... I'm 4 years in.", "NTA", "NTA. If she loves it so much she can take it to her new cabin.", "NTA.  I think she's not understanding the concept of giving you the cabin.  The reality is, your partner lost out on the inheritance they otherwise could have had in exchange for that cabin.  It's yours. Do what you want with it and she's just going to have to understand that you're putting your own style on it.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. MIL needs to understand that things change. She can't hold onto the past forever.", "NTA but you just inherited a whole whack of problems. They wanted to keep the cabin as it was and you'll be responsible for their bad feelings every time they see it. Would set up some gentle but firm boundaries right now.", "NTA since you kept everything", "NTA.  Please know that not everyone in the mother\u2019s age group needs a bunch of Knick knacks and broken stuff all over the place.  People of all ages like contemporary and minimalistic design.  You packed the stuff and kept it for her if she wanted it, which was thoughtful and more than reasonable.  Your SO approved, so I see nothing wrong with what you did at all.  Uncluttered home = uncluttered mind.", "Yea, OP I would make sure that you and your partner make this VERY clear to his family.", "Yep. Now I absolutely love antiques, particularly kitchen stuff from the 50\u2019s-70\u2019s like mushroom jars and those old yellow appliances. There is no way I can keep my grandmothers china, which she had three sets of, one that was her moms, one that is her \u2018for family\u2019 stuff that comes out at parties, and one that\u2019s specific for christmas and funerals (the good stuff), not to mention the boxes of pinwheel crystal and a special glass for every drink you can think of. In my house the only difference in the plates I use for holidays is the food on them. We simply do not have the space for all this crap and I certainly am not going to polish silver before and after every event, I barely got a day off for it in the first place. I have a 1x1 square of space to store all my towels\u2026where should these \u2018guest towels\u2019 live? If you\u2019re coming over for a drink I\u2019ve got them, but your options are a wine glass, a water glass, or a mug. I have three shelves for everything \u2018serve ware\u2019 including Tupperware. Find me a spot and sure ya, I\u2019d keep it. My grandmothers sewing machine that was a beautiful piece, would have loved yo keep it and cried when I drove away from the dump, but it didn\u2019t work and took up half my living room. We don\u2019t even have a kitchen table which the boomers are horrified about, but find me a place I can afford where I can have that life. I\u2019d love that, but I can\u2019t have that so I will not be your self storage.", "Yeah I had the same reaction. I think the important thing to remember with people who hoard is that the emotional connection/experience is deep. Like, it may never make sense to you, but it is very real to them. And outside actions on their beloved items (it\u2019s all beloved) can be viewed as dismissive, cruel, & even heartless. \n\nTo be clear, NTA. You did nothing wrong, haven\u2019t even gotten rid of anything AND made sure she collected what she wanted first. It is unfair to assume (and with no communication previously!) that you would maintain a space, one that she gave you and is also legally yours, the way she wants it. I only included the first bit bc conversations w hoarders can feel blindsiding and baffling.", "They didn\u2019t get rid of anything", "But they did keep those old things, they're just not displayed in the cabin", "They kept all the stuff.", "I agree with this", "No OP DID...... \n\n\n\n\"Specifically, I got a new couch as the original was from the 90s; got new table cloths; got rid of a lot of random furniture covering; and boxed up all the knick-knacks just laying about.
