When we go there his dad has a list of everything he wants done and we've done tons of improvements for him that makes his life much more comfortable,  solar panels new wiring, new heat pump etc. But if we make any he doesn't like or approval of he throws a fit and if possible he puts it back after we leave. He also makes improvements we don't want and sends us the bill.  The first couple years he would give away my dishes and cooking items as he didn't use them.

Now I absolutely love antiques, particularly kitchen stuff from the 50\u2019s-70\u2019s like mushroom jars and those old yellow appliances.

I think the important thing to remember with people who hoard is that the emotional connection/experience is deep. Like, it may never make sense to you, but it is very real to them.

I told the family that NOW was the time to come and find anything that they wanted - because it was now or never.\n\nThey never came by, never asked for anything. So, I had a HUGE tag sale, sold a bunch of stuff on FB marketplace and eBay and donated the rest to charity.

I couldn't wait anymore!\" One of my cousins had the nerve to suggest that I split any profits from what I sold with them since it all belonged to [relative] and should be split evenly among all the family members.\n\nWhen I stopped laughing, I said I'd be happy to give her a share when she paid me for the TWELVE YEARS I stored it. The bottom line was they wanted to keep the stuff, but at what was now my house.
