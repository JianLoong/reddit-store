I haven\u2019t told him he\u2019s not invited.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d like to take a quick moment to say, my mother has NEVER stepped over a boundary before with me. She has respected my decisions and choices throughout my entire life. I love my mother to death.\n\nI spoke over this situation with my fiance and we both decided it would be best to text her and say (paraphrased) \u201cThere are no +1s, he can\u2019t come. If you bring him I will ask you both to leave.\u201d\n\nWell, she responded with (paraphrased) \u201cWhy not? Why can\u2019t he sit in the hotel or drive us [my mom and grandma] to the wedding and just wait in the car? You\u2019re getting worked up over nothing.\u201d \n\nI am really distraught and feel disrespected that she would believe this is an okay situation to put me in. A man that, she has told me directly, does not treat her well. He has anger issues and is a heavy drinker. \n\nThis is really tough on me because, I have set the same boundary with my father (he wanted my sister to come as well) but accepted a simple no without explanation. \n\nI responded back with (paraphrased) \u201cI\u2019ve been clear with this boundary.

Please don\u2019t act like I\u2019m not listening when I don\u2019t have all the info.\u201d\n\nI really am hurting now though because, if he wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding, why would I want him anywhere near the events?\n\nI can\u2019t bend now or I\u2019ll be disrespecting everyone else, but I\u2019m already very stressed about saying no to people in general.\n\nI\u2019m 100% not letting him be involved with any other wedding events, and will tell them to leave if they both show up.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have to explain my reasoning about why I don\u2019t want someone I don\u2019t know involved with anything. If he does come, all I can imagine is him sitting in a hotel room guilt tripping my mom into trying to get him involved or taking away her time with us.\n\nAITA for not wanting him to be involved?\n\nEdit: I was heated, the \u201cin the same state\u201d was absurd.\n\nEdit2: to clarify, it was an elopement at the beginning that we changed to invite people to so i mistitled this a bit.

Are you willing to cause this problem because you're afraid of what his reaction will be? Please tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"If you need help to get you out, we WILL help you!\"", "From your post and comments, it sounds like your mother is in danger. \n\nYou are not wrong for not wanting BF there, however I would do what you need to to talk to your mother privately and ask her if she is ok. \n\nYou say that you guys have a fantastic relationship. Please reach out to her.", "NTA, as soon as she texted you that, you should\u2019ve let her know that if she shows up with him she\u2019ll be uninvited, or he can drop her off and buzz off till she\u2019s ready to be picked up.", "Yeah, here's the thing. Your mom has said she won't bring him to the event. She just wants him on the trip with her. If hes not going to be involved, then what's the issue? She won't be with youb24/7. She'll spend time with him when she's alone. You don't own anything other than the event itself. Especially if your mom is paying her own way and for her own hotel room etc. You're slightly the AH here. Stop looking for drama where it doesn't need to be. He comes with your mom, you don't see him. Simple. If he shows up, you ask them to leave. But I don't think that will happen.", "NTA. I had this exact same situation with my SIL during my wedding elopement last year. Stick to your guns, you\u2019re making the right decision. I still am working on forgiving my SIL, and I don\u2019t know if I ever truly will. I\u2019m really sorry your mom is shadowing over your wedding day like this. It\u2019s the worst feeling.", "1. You're not eloping. You're having a small destination wedding. The two are not the same.\n2. You are allowed to choose who to invite to your wedding.\n\n>e\u00b7lope\n\n>run away secretly in order to get married, especially without parental consent.", "NTA. Your marriage, your decision. Tell her that he\u2019s not invited and if she insists on bringing him, then she\u2019s welcome to not attend as well. It seems harsh but she needs to respect your wishes.", "If the mom\u2019s bf is indeed abusive, OP confronting him with info he got from his mom might make things worse for her. Abusers don\u2019t like to be called out and he\u2019d probably take it out on her for divulging their \u201cprivate business.\u201d That said, stand your ground and don\u2019t let the uninvited guy attend. If you have the capacity, maybe you could make some time for your mom, one on one, to get to the bottom of this relationship and see if she\u2019s interested in getting out. You can\u2019t make her, but you can let her know you\u2019re there for support. Feels backwards like you\u2019re parenting your parent, but everyone needs help sometimes.", "If I had the money, yes, but unfortunately it\u2019s not a plausible option at the moment.", "I\u2019ve spoken to her multiple times. She stays in a cycle of falling for guys that turn out to be assholes. I try and tell her the red flags and weird situations she mentions, but she tries her best to make all relationships work, even when SHE knows that there\u2019s a problem, she often brushes it off. I\u2019m very paranoid of my mother\u2019s partners from these previous types of relationships.", "Did you read the edits", "No, you\u2019re totally right. I\u2019m not encouraging you to tell her she\u2019s dating a creep. I was just making sure you know that your Mom may not be acting this way on her own volition \nRegardless, I hope you have an amazing wedding and even better marriage.", "Oof, and did you see the edits? Even if he stays in the car, it\u2019s going to be obvious that he\u2019s there (and will probably be Mom\u2019s ammunition to insist he be allowed as an actual guest).\n\nEdit: and now I\u2019m seeing OP\u2019s comments that his mom might be in an abusive situation. This is a lot.", "If you have no other way to get your mom to the wedding, the boyfriend driving her may be your only choice. Would you rather she didn't come at all, than drive and share a hotel with him, without him attending the ceremony? Because these may be your options", "Ah, ok. In that case, yes it sucks to have to put up this boundary, but at this point, you have to protect yourself too. \n\nStick to your guns with the caviot that when she is ready to leave this guy, you will be there for her. \n\nCongratulations! N", "Thanks \ud83d\ude4f me too!", "No, I want her there above all else, but its something I can\u2019t fold on. I\u2019m really split on what to do.", "This is not a debate sub read the rules", "Regarding the wedding, that\u2019s probably what I\u2019ll end up doing, just not pushing it any further unless he shows up.\n\nBut yes, I\u2019m always here (and she knows this) to discuss this with her. I\u2019m usually the one she vents to when it comes to life, which is fine, but it\u2019s hard when you only hear the bad and not much of the good to think of somebody in a good light.\n\nAnd thank you! \ud83d\ude4f", "Was that one invite for the both of them? In which case, yes it is a plus one", "No, I invited everyone, just like I said before. Learn to read.", "I probably learned how to do it at a younger age than you did lol\u2026 and saying you invited everyone doesn\u2019t mean that someone wasn\u2019t invited as a plus one. Learn the nuances of etiquette. \n\nSo then fine, you\u2019re just rude. It\u2019s incredibly rude to not invite an immediate family\u2019s partner to a wedding. Still, YTA.", "If my bestman and his partner weren\u2019t together they both still would\u2019ve been invited. I\u2019m being rude to you because you can\u2019t read a sentence properly after it being explained twice. It\u2019s incredibly rude to accuse me of something with no basis and the mental capacity of a 10 year old.", "Your response of \u201clearn to read\u201d is rude. You not inviting someone\u2019s partner is rude. Your defensiveness over this? It\u2019s absurd. Yes it\u2019s your day, however not a inviting your mother\u2019s boyfriend is, yet again, rude. \n\nI\u2019m surprised you made it to the engagement stage because for the life of me, I can\u2019t stand you in the internet, but spending a lifetime with you? I feel so sorry for your future spouse.", "I\u2019m not defensive I\u2019m telling you the situation and you just want to try and accuse me of bullshit. Sorry I\u2019m mean to morons after they continue to talk nonsense."]}
