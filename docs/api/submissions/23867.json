The title makes it sound like OP wants to know if she's an asshole for excluding children from a wedding.  Yet the text of the post has almost nothing to do with anyone complaining about children not being invited or feeling hurt that their kids can't come.\n\nInstead, it's almost exclusively focused on this weird \"bait and switch.\"  As you said, OP seems to be doing this weird test of \"I only want to pay for you to come to my wedding if you agreed to come thinking you'd be paying for your own trip.\"  Everything about kids being invited seems to be incoherent one-offs from OP that make no sense, including the last line of her saying that her sister is just trying to force her to let the kids come (which makes no sense with the rest of the narrative).  OP seems to draw other incoherent conclusions, like assuming that people are RSVPing \"no\" because they can't bring kids, rather than RSVPing no because they apparently(?) thought they'd have to pay for the trip themselves.\n\nSo, I see two possibilities here.  (1) OP didn't tell people that the trip would be paid for in advance.  She's either dumb or defensive to the point of being blind in thinking that the \"no\" RSVPs from guests, including her sister, are due to the no-child policy, rather than the cost of the trip.  (2) OP *did* tell other people that the trip would be paid for in advance, but intentionally withheld that information from her sister, perhaps due to conflict with her sister regarding sister's kids coming to the wedding.  This second scenario definitely makes OP the asshole, but is also somewhat baffling.  Like did she not send formal invitations to family?  Or did she print a different invitation for her sister that conveniently left out the fact that the trip would be paid for?", "Yeah, funny how easy it is to pick out the favorite child in these sometimes", "I'm not sure I can follow your logic?\n\nSister travelled a few months ago = she has no budget left.

I don't think you can leave a 16 year old as the sole caretaker of younger children for multiple days in most places. Even just a teenager by themselves for that long is on the books illegal in some states, much less the younger kids. It was probably a mistake for them to have done that in the first place and they *shouldn't* repeat it. Which means they need real childcare.", "This whole thing feels suspicious.

You don't even mention if your sister said the 16 year old could do it now, and furthermore, if you thought it was a possibility and actually wanted your sister there, why not mention it yourself?\n\nYou don't sound too broken up that your own sister can't attend your wedding, it doesn't really sound like you two talk very much.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo tricking involved. You invited her, like everybody else. SHE declined.", "NTA. She declined the invitation. Its too late now. Thats her own fault.", "NTA", "Am I in the twilight zone? Definitely read this exact post before - like almost word for word\u2026", "NTA. Your sister isn't making sense and also she sucks. My little sister is engaged right now and I consider myself more 'on her team' than as guest. Not only would I not expect her to pay for me, I would decline and insist she use the money on something she wanted but budget didn't allow for, or for her honeymoon. \n\nAlso your parents implying your \"tricked\" her is ridiculous, you sent the same invitation to everyone and no one else had this issue. Including them!", "NTA. She RSVP\u2019d no and then tried to change her tune if you were paying.", "ESH - my cousin and her friends had weddings at international adult only resorts but they were all young and no one had kids. Having a destination wedding and banning kids is an ah thing. You also expected your niece to be w free parent.", "I'm confused. OP planned to pay for everyone, many people declined, but now doesn't have money in the budget for her sister, who would have to pay $2000? \n\nYes YTA, not because you are having a child free wedding venue, but because you're trying to play this off like you really did want your sister there.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding", "Wait, so your own children are not invited to your wedding? You said no minors but mentioned that your oldest is 16.", "NTA\n\nI actually had a similar tho opposite situation with my wedding. \n\nI had a formal NYC wedding. And what the heck, invited kids. I had some immediate family coming from across the country that meeded to bring their [well behaved] kids, and I knew most of my guests would decline bringing kids and even if didn't no one really had problem kids in my crowd.\n\nMy cousin, saw kids were invited and declined the invite. She's quite posh, its a long drive for her, she assumed a shit show.\n\nWhen she saw the photos and heard from family it was formal she was quite pissed. Thankfully not to me, but I heard through the family grapevine. Oh well.\n\n(As for the kids... yes they dismantled one centerpiece & dueled with the flowers. And there was one finger swipe to the frosting on my cake. Neither incident bothered me, it was a party. They had fun, we had fun, no one got hurt, nothing truly got damaged, it was all good.)", "> they\u2019re irritated at a kids only wedding\n\nI like the idea that this is a thing. And to be fair, it sounds incredibly annoying.", "I've seen this attitude before. A rich person doesn't have problems extending their generosity to other well off people. But God forbid they give a handout to one of the poors.", "She declined because she didn\u2019t want to attend the wedding and used the kids as an excuse. She didn\u2019t realize she was also saying no to a free vacation.", "Right. You don't want people coming to your wedding just because its a free vacation. People who definitely needed to be there probably knew and that's how the sister found out.", "Because some people would rather not have kids around for one night, which is perfectly fine and should be normalized.", "Boo hoo? They\u2019re entitled to have a childfree destination wedding if they want to. You\u2019re making it sound like OP is the AH for paying for her guests to come are you serious lol", "Read the post. Sis originally declined bc she \u201cdidn\u2019t have childcare\u201d. So magically if the trip was paid for she\u2019d suddenly have childcare?", "Ehh. If someone posted an AITA about having their 16yo babysit other children while the parents went *out of the country,* that would be the biggest YTA this place has seen in a long time.", "Also, how do you prevent declinations to attend due to finances without including this information in the invitation?", "Yeah these were my thoughts too. $2k is a lot, I certainly would not be able to spend that on a destination wedding and would decline. If I later found out that the whole thing would have been paid for but wasn't told before RSVPing, I'd be hurt too. I don't think the childcare situation has much to do with it other than maybe being an excuse that isn't \"we can't afford a $2k vacation right now.\"\n\nYTA.", "Maybe because a bunch of people didn\u2019t come she used the allocated extra cash on upgrading flights or something else for the wedding? It\u2019s not hard to believe an unexpected cost might pop up.", "I wouldn't be surprised if 24 hour childcare costs $500+/day plus gas and groceries.", "The most obvious reason is school pick up and drop off. A teenager watching their siblings during summer break (probably with the grandparents checking in) isn't a big deal. But most schools are starting back up in a few weeks and if the kids have extracurricular activities or their schools start at different times, it can get complicated.", "We don't know where that vacation was. Was it a weekend away somewhere within driving distance vs a tropical destination resort for the wedding? OP seems like not the most reliable narrator and might not understand why those two things are different situations.", "OP says her sister declined because she couldn't find childcare. I don't think it's unreasonable to wonder if the sister would've been able to shuffle money around if she knew she wouldn't have to worry about the trip being covered.", "If the trip is paid for, she has a lot more money to spend on child care.", "I don't think the information was withheld, I think it was ignored.  The first roadblock is the childfree aspect.  If that's a showstopper, it doesn't matter if the wedding is free or not.  Since all travel costs were covered, that implies that there was some method of contact to arrange it.  Even if it wasn't immediately obvious that the trip would have been free, an interested party would at the very least get a quote on it.  \n\nDestination weddings can be remarkably reasonable when you consider the overall cost and planning involved with a wedding.  You can hook up with a resort that will provide all of the wedding preparations, photography, romantic scenery, reception halls, meals, and a bulk discount on rooms.  All you have to deal with are the clothes, the rings, and making sure everyone shows up sober enough to walk down the aisle while staying at a resort with free open bar.  It's still a lot of money, sure, but if you're content to drop $30K on a wedding anyway, you can get quite a bit out of a destination wedding package.\n\nCombine that with a points churner who's accumulated a couple million miles, and suddenly you've got everyone's airfare covered. \n\nSister is just upset because she didn't follow through.  Plenty of people checked to see how much it would cost, went \"oh hell yeah!\" and signed up for it without a second thought.  I have no doubt they were able to reach their budgeted capacity without any difficulty.  Tagging along later and expecting the same free vacation after everything had been booked is disingenuous.  She had her chance.", "It really depends on how old the younger siblings are. I wouldn\u2019t leave a 16 year old in charge of toddlers or babies for an extended time, but if they\u2019re older kids that mostly just need someone to make them dinner, it can be fine.", "It wasn't ignored. OP pointed out that she didn't reveal that she was paying until sister had already rsvp'd no.", "Have you considered that the sister with kids was trying to save face and didn't want to admit to her family that she couldn't afford the second vacation?  If my sibling had a ton of extra money (completely paying for a destination wedding) I may be a little embarrassed to admit that I'm broke. That's just me though.", "Yeah, but it would be courteous to at least mention that to immediate family, who you presumably would prefer to attend.", "you have some pretty shady friends and family if you are this worried about them attempting to defraud you on the happiest day of your life.", "Or the sister used the fact that it was child free and \"oh darn, no one can watch the kids\" as an easier to admit excuse for not being able to attend, when the real reason may have been entirely financial. She clearly *seems* to be well-off, and OP is obviously well-off enough to pay for several people to attend her destination wedding, so it's likely sister didn't want to admit financial issues.\n\nAnd yes, they did just get back from a vacation, but we don't have info on where, how much it cost, or how long they saved up to go on that vacation."]}
