But if they invited me to attend on their dime, I would be able to manage the time off and pet care costs. I imagine that calculation is even more fraught when childcare costs are involved. \n\nOP knows the people involved while we don't. But personally, I think assuming that not being able to come because they can't bring the kids means \"my precious babies *have* to be there!\" is an AH move. It could just as easily mean, \"Paying to get the kids there & sharing a hotel room with them is less expensive than paying for a babysitter 24 hours a day over multiple days,\" or, \"We only have X budgeted for vacation this year and spending Y on a trip without the kids means we can't take them on a trip this year and that's more important to us.\"", "Exactly - but I think we\u2019re missing a lot of background context about the relationship between OP and the sister.", "I think anyone with nieces or nephews (or, even, friends with kids) who would have a child-free wedding is ta\u2026 that said, I don\u2019t get your comment: I\u2019m assuming they let people know they were paying for people who couldn\u2019t afford the trip. It sounds like the sister is trying to get her to pay for the kids\u2019 sitters (when they didn\u2019t need one when sister wanted a kid-free vacation). \n\nIf\u2014as you inferred\u2014that was a secret or limited to the first X applicants offer, and people had to ask for the travel subsidy to know it existed, then, yeah: she\u2019s even a bigger ah in my book.", "Always say yes to the taco!", "Op doesn't want kids there that's it, very plain and simple stuff.", "It's OP's wedding, and they can do whatever they want for their own wedding, that they are paying for. If they want it to be child-free, they have every right to do that. Whether or not the sister, or any of the invited guests, has someone to watch their kids is not OP's problem", "The sister could hire her 16 year old to watch and she didn't say it was what she expected, the mother did. Also, the bride probably has a better understanding of her sister's finances than a stranger and would be better positioned to know if $2k is a big deal to them or not.", "Your sister is being greedy. You didn't fool anyone.", "She RSVP'd no, you made the arrangements for your guests.", "\"deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender\", it's a thing, there's a Wikipedia article.", "Op is paying for the sis+ husband if they come without kids. So the only cost to attend is childcare", "Also, not likely considering the reaction, but sister could have meant that they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford childcare and the vacation? Maybe (hopefully) they pay the 16 year old to babysit?", "But they didn't know that you were paying, so they were worrying about having to pay for the trip PLUS childcare, your cavalier assertions that the 16-year-old could just drop everything and babysit notwithstanding.\n\nNot like a 16 year old might have, you know, school, a part time job, social activities......", "Are you maybe taking that a bit too literally? It's possible that she meant that she couldn't afford travel + vacation days + childcare. She would have been okay with paying for travel + vacation days for her whole family, and now realizes that vacation days + childcare, but it didn't make sense for her to bring that up before because who expects someone to pay for your travel when it hasn't been offered to you?\n\nLike if I told my sister \"I can only afford to visit you if you pay for my flight\" that would be totally inappropriate within my family. (but \"I can't afford to travel, would you like to visit me?\" might be met with \"it's okay, I'll buy your flight for you\")", "Tell me exactly how she communicated badly that no kids were allowed", "I remember it, too.  The couple were going to be married in a state far from family and friends.  Most people declined, and they decided to change the venue to a Hawaii destination wedding and pay hotel and air fare for those people who had accepted the original wedding invitation\n \nThe brides sister originally declined but changed her mind when she found out about the Hawaii offer.

Not everyone likes children.", "No she's not. She withheld that information from the sister until after the sis said no. The sister wasn't given enough information to make an informed decision on \"the only cost to attend is childcare.\" OP won't pay for them now that they know that the trip would have been free.", "OP would have paid if they responded yes originally. OP is not paying now. Sis+ are upset they didn't know because they would have made a different decision.\n\nThe only cost would have been childcare but they didn't know that when they made the decision.", "She never told her sister that she was paying for the guests. If she really wanted her there, it would have come up when her sister called her to say she couldn't go. \n\nJust because she said her kids were the reason doesn't mean money didn't play a factor in this too.", "That wedding in Hawaii was supposed to be last month. \n\nI wonder how it went, and if the sister was still pitching a fit.\n\nAnyone seen an update from that OP?", "That doesn't mean the 16 year old is willing to do it every time or that the nanny is willing to work overnights while your aunt goes to a destination wedding. And nannies do in fact cost money. Your aunt would have to pay a premium for the nanny to cover a trip.", "You are assuming a lot about their situations. You should have told them. Also, in the post you said you received \"many\" no RSVPs, but here you say it's only your sister and aunt. Which is the truth?", "How did OP trick anyone? Their costs are paid for by the bride and groom.", "I think that's a very tactful way to weed out those who actually want to attend the wedding and those who are just looking for a free vacation. OP willingly paying for guests after they've RSVP'd is a bonus.", "There is something off about that aspect.  If your rationale for paying for everyone's expenses is, as OP states: \n\n>we didn't want anyone we want there not to be able to come because of finances.\n\nYou kind of have to tell them that ahead of time?\n\nThey don't have to pay for everyone, and more to the point it is unlikely that anyone receiving the invitation would assume that to be the case, so there are probably at least a few of the 'no' RSVPs who did so for exactly that reason, which OP is supposed to have been trying to prevent.\n\nAnd it kind of doesn't make sense for her to claim paying for the sister to attend now is not in the budget, because I would think you'd budget for everyone attending? or at least the number of declines would create wiggle room to give the sister something?  Again, I wouldn't say they are required to pay for anyone to attend, but if you say you are doing that, and then someone asks you to do that, their being upset with you for refusing is understandable.", "Op s sister Wants to come with the kids and for op to pay - at least that's what I understood - regarding the alternative arrangements. Did I get it wrong?", "Her sister replied no she couldn\u2019t come Bc no kids allowed. Why would money come in to play? Her sister made the decision not to take part in the wedding because she had nobody to watch her kids.", "Ding ding ding! She left out that information when her sister called. She doesn\u2019t want her sister to attend, and she needs to be honest.", "I think the sister declined because she didn't know she wouldn't have to cover the cost of the trip. Paying for childcare for a week or however long everyone will be there is very expensive. Knowing you wouldn't need to cover the cost of the trip would change the decision-making process, and OP was wrong not to let people know that beforehand.", "OP invited adult guests only but did not mention that the trip and accommodations would be paid for (and possibly made the decision to pay for everyone based on the low RSVP count?

Too late now because you couldn't afford it, so I\"m not going to pay for you\"", "They didn't want to spend the money. That doesn't mean they don't have the money to spend.
