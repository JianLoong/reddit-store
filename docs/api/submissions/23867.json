Sounds like your sister's pissed because she realized she overthought herself out of a free vacation. I'm guessing that all of your guests got the same invitation, that you didn't single her out with a special invitation that was missing key information . . . So yeah, this is all on her.", "NTA. She now wants a free vacation. Why would your parents think you \"tricked\" her? It was her decision.", "NTA. This is a genius way to handle it.", "NTA. You made it very clear you didn\u2019t want kids at your wedding. The fact you paid for people to come is exceedingly generous.", "NTA", "I've read this before.", "NTA. She was invited. She declined.\n\nSuddenly, when she found out she'd passed up a free vacation, she wants to change things. When you declined to give her the free vacation, she went full DARVO and said that *you* were the one who didn't want her there.\n\nYour parents should not have fallen for your sister's obvious ploy, and I think you've correctly identified her motives.", "Genuine question: by saying that you paid for all the guests, you mean you would pay for your sister to come as well, right?", "NTA - So your parent's think you \"tricked\" your sister because you didn't originally tell her that you were planning on paying for everyone in attendance? I'm sorry but your sister seems to be the asshole here. She was completely fine with not attending your wedding until she knew that she would basically get a free vacation out of it.", "If people want a child free wedding, you comply. If your sister continues to push, maybe try the \"uninvite     trick\"", "The surprise \u201cI\u2019m now paying\u201d is kinda AH territory. You basically were \u201ctesting\u201d people and then rewarding those that fit your requirements. \n\nI don\u2019t get the \u201cI had already paid what I had budgeted for\u201d. For example if you sent out 20 invitations didn\u2019t you budget for 20 people? Of course knowing someone might say no, but still, if you intended to cover costs I assume your future husband and you said \u201cwhat if everyone says yes, can we afford to cover that?\u201d, again full well knowing a few might not come. Or did you have a secret number of \u201cwell if 10 yeses then we will pay for them, but if 11 or more we won\u2019t\u201d kind of thing? \n\nSeems really odd that if your sister and her husband (no kids) decided to come around you wouldn\u2019t have 2k in your budget for them. \n\nI dunno, you get one wedding day (per husband lol) and it\u2019s isn\u2019t worth not having your sister there over petty stuff - unless you don\u2019t like her, then that changes everything and maybe rethink this post.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re fine go enjoy your wedding.", "NTA I love this. You have out smarted the entitled people. I love the fact now that your sister would not come because of childcare can now come for the free vacation.\n\nSorry if you didn\u2019t want to celebrate with me then don\u2019t expect a free trip from me. Tell your parents since they paid nothing on this trip they can finance your sister.\n\nBut do not let them guilt or manipulate you.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but your topline question isn\u2019t the main conflict here.  The problem isn\u2019t that you are having a destination wedding at an adult only resort.  Nor is the issue that you generously paid for the travel expenses of the guests who accepted your invitation.  It\u2019s that your sister RSVP\u2019d no because she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d get a free trip out of it.  Your sister\u2019s TA here.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how you paying changes things for them. They\u2019d still have to find childcare, the kids still wouldn\u2019t be able to come. Based on your view of their financial status, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem like they couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nIt seems like they said no and now they\u2019re upset they aren\u2019t getting a free vacation like everyone else. Interesting how they suddenly can work it out after they found out you\u2019d be paying if they had said yes. They could have always left the kids alone, they could have always come. They chose not to because they\u2019re irritated at a kids only wedding, but that irritation goes away as soon as they find out you\u2019d be paying for it. How did you trick them?", "Info: was it stated on the invitation that you would pay or did you only tell after people answered yes/no?", "NTA.  your parents can pay for it.", "NTA and a big round of applause for finally finding a clever solution to the childfree wedding problem that plagues this subform.\n\nShe RSVP'd no, you made the arrangements for your guests.  If she wants to come now she can make her own way.", "NTA\n\nSo your sister says she won't go if she has to pay, but if you bribe her with a $2K vacation, she would? If that's her mindset, it would only have been a matter of time before you went NC - she sounds awful. Your parents too. \n\nLet me guess - sis is the Golden Child?", "YTA - correct me if im wrong but it sounds like you sort of duped your guests? You sent out wedding invitations for a destination wedding and were not upfront about the costs of wedding? That kind of makes you an AH.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't trick anyone.  She chose not to attend, now that she found out its a free trip, apparently she can go.", "I have not posted it anywhere else.", "It\u2019s funny, but as soon as I read it, it sounded familiar. I feel like there was a heading that was something similar.", "Her and her husband if they had RSVP'd yes.   But she said she couldn't come without her kids.", "Hating kids has nothing to do with not wanting them at an incredibly expensive and personal event. I\u2019ve worked with kids my entire adult life, I absolutely love kids, but I don\u2019t want to deal with them on my wedding day. The kids won\u2019t want to be there, it\u2019s incredibly boring for them. She wouldn\u2019t have to go to these lengths if she could trust the people around her won\u2019t bring their kids anyways. \n\nAll OP wants is an adult event. Kids don\u2019t need to be at weddings. And if you\u2019re going to assume every adult who doesn\u2019t want an adult event to be ruined by children \u201chates kids\u201d then it seems like you need to work on your judgmental attitude. It seems like you\u2019re the unkind person here.", "My wedding will cost less than my sister's wedding. And there won't be uninvited kids there to fuck things up.", "How is she not a nice person? Perhaps she wanted people to accept for the right reason, not because they want a free holiday. Her sister declined because she didn't want to put herself out to attend her sisters wedding, which is her right, but was then absolutely prepared to put herself when she realised there was something to gain. Now that is not a nice person.", "Child free weddings are very common. Just as common is entitled parents who think the rule doesn\u2019t apply to them and try and bring children anyways. OP circumvented those entitled parents before the issue could happen. \n\nIt\u2019s a smart way to ensure no dumb parent \u201caccidentally\u201d brings the unwelcome children.", "Paying for friends and family to attend a destination wedding because the couple didn\u2019t want money to prevent their loved ones attending isn\u2019t nice?? \ud83e\udd14", "Oh god here we go with the \u201cyou hate kids\u201d crowd just because someone wants one single day for themselves. God forbid.", "It sounds like it wasn\u2019t on the invite. Its super generous to pay for the wedding for people but when people are budgeting whether they go and need to account for childcare, knowing the actual cost of the wedding is kind of a super important detail.", "Not on invitation. Strangely enough only my sister and one aunt RSVP'd no. Both called to tell me they would have come if they could bring their kids.", "It's a destination wedding. Nobody that I sent an invitation to could not afford to go. I did speak to a couple of my cousins in advance about the wedding and whether they would be able to attend. I did this because they are both young. One has a new job and one has a toddler and is not back at work yet. Both of them RSVP'd yes and were happy when I told them I was covering flights and accommodations.", "Why because she didn\u2019t down right offer them a free vacation? Plus maybe op was waiting to see how many rsvp she got before she made any promises.\n\nShe probably had x amount of money saved for the wedding. If too many rsvp then paying may not have been an option.", "May you explain your point of view? I don't understand why you see her as the AH", "No she said she would pay for people accommodation at the resort which is a no children allowed resort. Her sister wants to bring her kids and wants the bride to pay for out of resort accommodation which is completely entitled of her", "She thinks people should have decided without regard to finances, but the cost of travel would have been a huge factor for less wealthy guests. Unintentionally classist at best", "OP said they're paying for their guest, only condition is no children so why is op ta?", "Sorry, I thought I had read it before. This seems to be a very common problem. NTA, OP. Sometimes you have to prove to entitled people that they won't get their way.", "Then you are NTA. As you said, she had no problems leaving her kids for a long weekend, and going to weddings isn't a right, it's a luxury. Even if someone cannot go, it isn't a fault of the host, although it's unfortunate.", "Neither of the people who RSVP'd no require child care. My sister has a 16 year old the have left with his younger sibling before while she went on a vacation with her husband. My aunt has a nanny.", "If someone had answered no and stated that they couldn\u2019t afford it, would you have told them you were paying and then accept to change their rsvp to a yes (if they wanted to)?", "Okay so you did sort of trick people and youre being extremely presumptuous in saying you know what people can/cant afford.", "Because of the way they did it - they sent the invitations for the wedding indicating no children (which is totally fine), sister RSVPs no (also fine), THEN after OP gets the RSVP they say theyre covering the costs for everyone.", "I read it too. Destination wedding, said no to rsvp, heard it was paid for and wanted to come. I think it was a brother tho\n\nNTA op", "Why not just be honest about this though? Given your comments/tone about your sister it sounds like you didnt want her there anyway.", "Fair enough"]}
