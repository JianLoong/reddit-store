I used to not do so much for her and it all changed when she got diagnosed with cancer. Now before you go and write me in the wrong, I was only there because she needed help and I decided to live there until she recovered. But it came with a price; my sanity. I had two cousins (12 M and 4/5[can't remember exactly] F) that my aunt dropped off every evening since she had to work. When she did, it felt like every evening was absolute hell. They always managed to get into fights and even sometimes I was dragged into situations that I'd rather not be in. \n\nBut nevertheless, I stayed. While I was there, I had fallen in love with my current partner (22 M) and we decided that after our first anniversary, that he should come down for my birthday weekend. My grandmother had no clue about my relationship nor the fact I was using my money to do it. So I did lie to her and told her it was a church meet up at my local church. I had made sure to do a lot of chores (more than I usually do) and sure enough, she allowed. I saved up money past that point from my current job and me and my partner eventually had stayed at a hotel around the town. We had a blast and everything was fine. That was, until my aunt spotted me at the local Wal-Mart with him. We were getting food and other things for the weekend, but I had a nervous feeling and it seems I was right. Lying again, we grabbed the food and left as soon as possible.\n\nWhen I got home the first day, it seemed like nothing was wrong. So I casually spent my time doing some chores and then went to relax for the rest of the evening. The next day, the entire table flipped over. I came home from work (8 hr shift in the morning, mind you.) and my grandmother and aunt had arrived. They had confronted me about the situation, and soon had taken my laptop, VR headset and personal phone until I admitted the truth. They then gave a stern talking to, but I never got my stuff back and that made me quite angry. \n\nI was overwhelmed with many emotions; anxiety, anger, sadness, and even some regret. But I couldn't handle it anymore. From day one, I had been treated as a maid in that household and I couldn't stand being treated so rudely. So when my grandmother was asleep, I had grabbed her wallet and used her credit card to buy a bus ticket. I left the exact night, taking only a few things since I only bought for one bag. Many had tried to contact me; close friends, family and other people I had met in the town. I only answered to my brother, whom sided with me since her knew how horrible my grandmother was. \n\nSo, in your humble opinions, am I the asshole?\n\n[Note: me and the grandmother have talked; I am going to repay her and pay for shipping to get my stuff back. Hopefully it can be all good.]", "created_utc": 1667587007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym6oif/aita_for_using_my_grandmothers_60_f_credit_card/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It helps that you are going to pay her back, but you still stole from her in the first place. You're an adult. You got a job. You could have just taken your own money and bought the ticket, or saved up a little while longer to get the ticket. Or asked your significant other to help. There were options.", "without a doubt, YTA.  Yes, the confrontation with your grandmother and aunt was really weird, but that doesn't give you the right to be a common thief.", "YTA for committing a CRIME by stealing and using someone else\u2019s credit card. She could have called the police! I do understand why you were upset and by the way they illegally stole your property too. Get out if there. You do owe your grandmother repayment but she and your aunt owe you your property too.", "NTA for leaving, but very wrong to use her credit card. At least you will pay her back.\n\nI don't understand why your grandmother and aunt think they can treat you -- a 22-year-old -- like a kid in middle school. Not being allowed to have a bf, having to lie to go on a date, getting punished for that by having them take away your laptop, phone, etc. This is nuts. \n\nAll this while you're doing them a favor by helping your grandmother when she got cancer.

This whole post is questionable. Why are they treating you like a child if you're 22?
