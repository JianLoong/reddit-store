Well you sure show her where your priorities are. Marriage is about sacrifices. Yes, you paid for everything ahead of time but tickets are resellable. And a preseason game?

They golf, travel, otherwise do not work on weekends. \n\nAdditionally, this is the first pre-season game on the Eagles schedule for this season.

You are an arsehole.", "Why did you even come here to ask, since you\u2019ve clearly already made up your mind to go?  Obviously most people agree that YTA, but you refuse to listen, so go to the game, but don\u2019t blame anyone but yourself when your marriage starts to fall apart, since you so clearly put your own wants and desires over those of the person you\u2019ve promised to support unconditionally.", "And your an AH for it. Why did you bother coming here and asking? Your obviously very comfortable with being an ah as long as you can watch football.", "You clearly just want a wife for the image and help around the house by how you talk.", "I am really confused. You are in Baltimore but you love a team from Philly.  Why not just go to a game in Philly which is only 100 miles a way? I am sure a bus wouldn\u2019t cost too much.", "No but surgeries are still scary, and she's not going to be able to walk around great or very much at all for a few weeks I imagine.

I thought maybe he didn\u2019t have any money and that is why he could go to Philly to watch a game but he talks about a prenup so there must be some money he is trying to protect.

It\u2019s not a broken hip. Has she tried to call the surgeons office and ask for a different date for surgery (probably only a couple of days or at most a week or two later)? If she had scheduled first, I would say tough luck to you but since you already had plans, she should schedule in a way that\u2019s slightly considerate of her caretaker.

His weekend was planned and paid for before her surgery came up. Her surgery is a month away, so I\u2019m leaning toward it not being emergent, but I\u2019m not going to make assumptions. If she has other dates available and picked this one, that\u2019s on her. I juggle 3 schedules (mine, my partner\u2019s, and my kid\u2019s) and do my best to schedule things in such a way no one is inconvenienced, but I do understand it isn\u2019t always possible to make it work perfectly. Sometimes one of us has to sacrifice and in the grand scheme of things, a pre-season game isn\u2019t the worst thing to sacrifice for medical needs.", "> Did your wife pick the date of surgery?\n\nIt's extremely rare that someone chooses the date for their surgery.

Why isn't she being supportive of him? This is NOT an emergency surgery.", "Finally a rational comment! Flat feet are not an emergent surgery! There is no reason she can't have the surgery a few days later. I rescheduled cardiac surgery ffs!", "Do you have any idea how hard it is to get slots for necessary surgery classified as \u201celective\u201d these days?  You wait and wait for them to call, drop what you are doing when they do, and take the date they give you, or wait months. And it\u2019s only getting worse.

Is that right?\n\nIf her surgery is elective and not that important, neither is his goddamn football game, you act like they're never gonna play again, and this is their very last game. \n\nSince you've never had issues with your feet it'snot your call to make. I've actually had surgery on my feet. They became so painful that after working all day I would come home at night and would not even be able to let them touch the floor.
