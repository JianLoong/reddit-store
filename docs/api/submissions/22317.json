Well you sure show her where your priorities are. Marriage is about sacrifices. Yes, you paid for everything ahead of time but tickets are resellable. And a preseason game?

They golf, travel, otherwise do not work on weekends. \n\nAdditionally, this is the first pre-season game on the Eagles schedule for this season.

And you used your experience as justification for making that comment.  I was just asking for clarification.  Because I don\u2019t believe that rescheduling for a few days later is as easy as you say.", "It was when I did it asshole!", "Why? Why should he cancel a trip just because she can\u2019t go? She does not require any care. That\u2019s totally missing from this analysis. Like why not just do separate things, she doesn\u2019t need him to be there. She\u2019s going to be at home in a cast, so he must pretend to be mobility limited for the same period? Redditors are delusional.", "Do people need to be taught basic etiquettes now?", "Football fan here too, and I agree\u2014it\u2019s a pre-season game!! Get real. Totally TA", "He likely wasnt even involved in the entire scheduling process, judging on his character presented here to us, and prolly last moment felt that his child-plans were in danger. I know the type. If you prioritize a football game over a surgery your wife has to go through, 100% YTA every single time, no matter what.", "More curious still if wife actually scheduled the surgery *after* football plans were made and somehow got a date this immediate in the future.\n\nMore likely that the surgery was scheduled first, then the buddies decided to go to this particular football game, and OP agreed. Otherwise, this story is not believable.", "I've been able to schedule my two elective surgeries. They just said, \"We're X weeks out and I operate on Tues/Thurs.\" I couldn't pick a random date, but I could choose which of his available dates I wanted.\n\nEveryone I know who didn't have an emergency was given dates to choose from. Where are you that it's dictated to you?", "Yeah, nope. My back was \u201cIn 2 weeks or in 6 months\u201d. Literally my options.", "Well,  \n\nEntitlement: belief that one is deserving of or entitled to certain privileges. \n\nWe can agree to disagree on this.  Selfish, inconsiderate, self-centered, absolutely.", "I\u2019ve gone through that surgery. No, you can\u2019t reschedule it without having to deal with the pain of flat feet. \n\nPeople don\u2019t realize how important that arch in your feet really is.  I had flat feet my whole childhood. It caused me immense pain when playing sports. I didn\u2019t have the tendons nor the foot structure but I didn\u2019t know that until I ended up getting injured. Only one foot is fixed, I\u2019ll probably have to get the other one later. \n\nThat arch gives your foot suspension, which is super useful for just walking. And then after the surgery you\u2019re going to deal with the new bone structure for years.", "U.S. When I had wrist surgery (twice) they said, \"Here's our open dates. Pick one.\" She could've picked a later date so he could get this one bucket list item checked off.", "I think this is something that varies by what type of procedure you\u2019re having, how many people on staff can do the procedure, who you\u2019re comfortable with having do your procedure, how many ORs/how big the hospital is etc. \n\nIn some cases there isn\u2019t a huge range of availability and turning down one date doesn\u2019t mean getting another date a week later, it could mean multiple weeks or more.", "Yeah but was it even asked? It's a good question. Not like he made these plans after she scheduled her surgery. Also I realize foot issues are painful, I know people with them. But I still say communicate.  How hard is it. Honey your surgery is the same day I am suppose to be out of town, do you mind if we see if they can move the date...Same could be said for her...\nBoth are at fault to me.", "She's been living with it for years but suddenly the day her husband has something planned IT'S AN EMERGENCY!", "I'm not rich but i guess i have fooled all the surgical coordinators into thinking i am. In 3 different hospitals!"]}
