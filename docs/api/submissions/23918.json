You didn't cause all this drama, your bigoted parents did.", "NTA\n\nYou did what you felt was right. Funerals are closure for the living, not the dead. Your sister obviously had a complicated relationship with dad, and needed this.\n\nI would have done the same thing in your situation.", "Your mom sounds horribly unreasonable and mean \ud83d\ude22 how you could get mad at a daughter coming to her fathers funeral is like sick. and the truth is, you don\u2019t know if she was the reason behind your father shunning her away & that\u2019s why she\u2019s so angry to see her come back. Truth is if your dad and her hated each other that much she would not have shown up right? I think you did the right think and NTA. I have a feeling you\u2019ll find out allot over the years.", "NTA. Even if your sister being gay is bad for your family, she is still their child, and deserves to know when the people that birthed her dies. I'm surprised your siblings were mad at you tbh. I understand your parents being mad, conservatives can't be changed, but your siblings that grew up with each other is just... In any case, there was nothing wrong with what happened, and I hope you and your sister and her family have a wonderful life", "NTA. She deserved to say good bye and have closure. You should continue to have contact with her if she is willing.", "No no, far you\u2019re far from being an AH.\n\nIf I was in Iris\u2019 situation I would have wanted to know.\n\nThe rest of your family are AH\u2019s though.\n\nWell done and thank you for thinking of Iris.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. She had the right to know.\n\nIt doesn't matter why they were fighting, she had the right to know. And your family is made of AH for not wanting her to know or not wanting her there.\n\nThe fact that this is about her being gay makes it so much worse.\n\nYou're almost an adult now. Please reach out to your sister and try to have a relationship with her and your nephews.", "YTA. Sorry... But if you knew how your father felt, you shouldn't have told her or atleast told her not to come. Your parents are wrong, however it was his funeral & he had a right to not have someone there he didn't want. I sure wouldn't want someone at my funeral I hated, relative or not. While your heart was in the right place, you had no business letting her come to the funeral. You should have told her after.", "NTA\n\nYour family sucks, you did the right thing and you should be proud of standing up to your close minded family who choose their religious beliefs over their own family. Good job :)", "NTA. Iris needed closure, and you did the right thing.", "NTA: your family is what I like to call a shanda, and a bunch of schmucks and putzes too. Would they disown you for having a pork chop? That's more forbidden by Torah than what Iris is doing. I hope moving forward you can rebuild your relationship with Iris and distance from the rest of your family.", "NTA for telling your sister, but everyone is the AH for keeping distance because you were \u201cforbidden\u201d from contacting her.  You all should be ashamed. Instead of being decent, you all took the cowards way out and cut contact..  I would rather go with sister than be with a hateful group of people like your family.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re never the asshole for going against homophobia", "YTA.  You should have reached out to your mom and siblings first and let them know you will inform Iris.  You can argue with them that you believe it\u2019s her right to know.\n\nInstead you had Iris show up unexpectedly while everyone is emotional and your mom and siblings are unprepared.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's at the center of the grief circle.  Her comfort and peace was paramount.  If seeing someone there would distress her, she shouldn't have to.  \n\nHowever, your family has been so shockingly evil that it's hard to consider usual etiquette  I feel terrible that your sister felt the need to subject herself to them for closure.

It\u2019s also very easy to say that when you\u2019re not in that position. It sounds like OP did what they could to push for reconciliation as soon as they were old enough to do so.

OP did cause conflict with her family over it but her family have chosen a cruel hill to die on, and her sister deserves closure as much as anyone else.
