Absolutely NTA\n\nI hope you and Iris can have a relationship now that you are an adult", "NTA for telling your sister, but absolutely an asshole for going along with the rest of the vile bigots in your family up until this point. If you were a decent human being you would have told the rest of your family that their bigotry was a deal breaker, but no... you drank the religious hate and alienated your sister with the rest of the vile bigots in your family. Your sister is the only de4cent human being in your entire family and she's better off without the rest of you.", "NTA funerals are for the living, you did the right thing to allow your sister closure.", "Your family are assholes and your old enough to tell them to all go to hell and support your sister.", "NTA  \nYour sister deserves to know, and the rest of the family needs to start behaving like human beings.", "YTA because you\u2019re a liar. No one would ever sit shiva for someone who wasn\u2019t dead. Such a load of BS.", "Sometimes the black sheep of the family is actually the white sheep of the family.", "Not quite the same as spouse/life partner.  The kids generally leave home at some point.  Mom is the one who was sharing her life with him and living it day-to-day.  She's the one who would have made medical decisions for him had he been unable to himself.  She's the one who's going to reach out in bed at night for a while with no one there.  She's the one who will now be spending her evenings alone.\n\nAgain, I'm leaning towards E S H because this woman is completely disgusting and horrible.  It's hard to muster up sympathy for her when she did what she did to her own daughter.", "But it's a wallet and briefcase in one! Oooh, the savings!", "And now she\u2019s 21 and can reflect on that experience and on whether her parents were, and still are, bigots.", "NTA but why do you have anything to do with your awful, nasty family?", "NTA, you did the right thing.\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "You'd think for 2k you'd get professional quality \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab, like they look good, but not 2k good? Definitely don't tip on these at that price.....he got like a 150% tip", "NTA\n\nYour family sure is.", "NTA. You didn't cause drama- your parents did when they chose to abandon one of their children for being gay. Your sister's closure is more important than whatever her deadbeat father's last wishes were.   \n\n\nMaybe I'd feel differently if your sister had chosen to cut ties with her parents for whatever reason, *and* if she'd been an adult when she'd done so. But she didn't, and she wasn't.", "You\u2019re absolutely wrong about that. I\u2019ve known multiple queer and trans folk whose parents sat shiva for them when they were disowned. It\u2019s not common in Reform or Conservative traditions, but among some Orthodox and *especially* among Hasidic families it\u2019s far from unheard of.", "Small nitpick: we don't choose who we love. I can no more choose to be straight than my sister can choose to be gay. They don't hate their daughter for a choice she made. They hate her for who she is.", "Upvoted cause I love that movie. Robin Williams was a comedic genius.", "It's Jewish? I googled it and was told it was Hinduist.", "Is Shiva the mourning ritual?", "sitting shiva is the mourning ritual, yeah.  shiva means seven in hebrew, a reference to the week-long tradition for mourning.", "Nta. Im sorry for your loss & that you have to even go through this but esp when your grieving. Its just sad. And so unnecessary. I was brought up to believe that God makes no mistakes. & being gay isn't something you choose. I was also brought up to believe that God does not allow for anyone to pass judgment. Why would one sin be better than another?  But its just sad. I think God would be very disappointed in your parents, more than your sisters.", "You, Iris and Iris' wife are the only people who acted in a humane way.  Your family sucks, and I can't even imagine sitting shiva for a very-much-alive sibling because they are lesbian. NTA", "NTA for telling her. YTA for turning your back on your sister.", "NTA always choose kindness over bigotry. Good job. And I am very sorry for your loss.", "NTA  Your family are AHs. Cut them out and be a friend to your sister. You'll feel better for it!", "Shiva is the name of a Hindu God, but sitting shiva is a Jewish ritual. Unrelated. Like \ud83e\udd87 and \ud83c\udfcf", "Sitting shiva is a Jewish custom, Shiva is a Hindu god.", "NTA\n\nYour family are limited. You could never be an AH for having compassion. Well done for doing the human thing and letting her know.", "NTA, not at all. OP is now 21 and can decide things for herself. It was her moral right to contact her sister about important family information. It was Iris's moral right to come to funeral for herself. I think OP has done the right thing by trying to keep the family in minimal contact. I would say next time do not wait until someone dies, tell them about family member who is sick in case they decide they want to see them.\n\nWe cannot force people to associate with anyone but the idea that so and so is dead to me may feel true but it is not literally true and we should not pretend it is if that is not what we ourselves think.", "NTA. Well done for telling her. How awful if you hadn\u2019t.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.\n\nTry to remember that you are an adult and don\u2019t need to ask your mother for permission to talk to people.", "NTA. Funerals are not for the dead they are for the grieving. You gave your sister the only shred of closure she may have had a chance at.", "Sorry, but if she knew the sister wasn't wanted she had no business being there. Period. It was not her funeral. It was not her choice. She did not have A right to be there knowing she wasn't wanted. That's like saying she has the right to walk into her parents house uninvited just bc its her parents. If you're not welcome and not wanted, regardless if their reason is valid or not... You don't go. You don't get to purposely go somewhere you're not welcome just Bc you need closure", "for a second i was \u2018like dragons and cricket?\u2019", "NTA if I were you I would tell your family that your sister had a right to know as she still has a hiyuv to mourn, it's her decision if she wants to or not but you would not be the person to stand in the way of informing her of her halachic obligation ie \u201cnot place a stumbling block\u201d, and that female homosexuality is not assur deoraita and honestly not even assur derabanan, just discouraged as something not \"tznua\", remind them of b'tzelem elohim, k\u2019vod hab\u2019riyot, ra\u1e25manut, g\u2019milut chasadim, v\u2019ahavta l\u2019re\u2019acha kamocha, sovlanut, adam yachid, and that with Tish B'av having been just 2 weeks past and Yamim Noraim being 5 weeks away they would good to remember that Yoma 9b:8 states that \u201cHowever, considering that the people during the Second Temple period were engaged in Torah study, observance of mitzvot, and acts of kindness, and that they did not perform the sinful acts that were performed in the First Temple, why was the Second Temple destroyed? It was destroyed due to the fact that there was wanton hatred during that period. This comes to teach you that the sin of wanton hatred is equivalent to the three severe transgressions: Idol worship, forbidden sexual relations and bloodshed\u201d and Yom Kippur Haftarah states \u201cNo, this is the fast I desire: To unlock fetters of wickedness, And untie the cords of the yoke To let the oppressed go free; To break off every yoke.  It is to share your bread with the hungry, And to take the wretched poor into your home; When you see the naked, to clothe him, And not to ignore your own kin. Then shall your light burst through like the dawn And your healing spring up quickly; Your Vindicator shall march before you, The Presence of HaShem shall be your rear guard\u201d and that they\u2019d better get on doing the interpersonal teshuvah asap because Yom Kippur only atones for transgressions between a person and G-d, but they need to do the teshuvah for the evil they did to you and your sister before, and then I\u2019d go LC or NC and go and to teshuvah yourself with your sister", "NTA   No very religious in my opinion."]}
