Your sister obviously had a complicated relationship with dad, and needed this.\n\nI would have done the same thing in your situation.", "Your mom sounds horribly unreasonable and mean \ud83d\ude22 how you could get mad at a daughter coming to her fathers funeral is like sick. and the truth is, you don\u2019t know if she was the reason behind your father shunning her away & that\u2019s why she\u2019s so angry to see her come back. Truth is if your dad and her hated each other that much she would not have shown up right? I think you did the right think and NTA. I have a feeling you\u2019ll find out allot over the years.", "NTA. Even if your sister being gay is bad for your family, she is still their child, and deserves to know when the people that birthed her dies. I'm surprised your siblings were mad at you tbh. I understand your parents being mad, conservatives can't be changed, but your siblings that grew up with each other is just... In any case, there was nothing wrong with what happened, and I hope you and your sister and her family have a wonderful life", "NTA. She deserved to say good bye and have closure. You should continue to have contact with her if she is willing.", "No no, far you\u2019re far from being an AH.\n\nIf I was in Iris\u2019 situation I would have wanted to know.\n\nThe rest of your family are AH\u2019s though.\n\nWell done and thank you for thinking of Iris.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. She had the right to know.\n\nIt doesn't matter why they were fighting, she had the right to know. And your family is made of AH for not wanting her to know or not wanting her there.\n\nThe fact that this is about her being gay makes it so much worse.\n\nYou're almost an adult now. Please reach out to your sister and try to have a relationship with her and your nephews.", "YTA. Sorry... But if you knew how your father felt, you shouldn't have told her or atleast told her not to come. Your parents are wrong, however it was his funeral & he had a right to not have someone there he didn't want. I sure wouldn't want someone at my funeral I hated, relative or not. While your heart was in the right place, you had no business letting her come to the funeral. You should have told her after.", "NTA\n\nYour family sucks, you did the right thing and you should be proud of standing up to your close minded family who choose their religious beliefs over their own family. Good job :)", "NTA. Iris needed closure, and you did the right thing.", "NTA: your family is what I like to call a shanda, and a bunch of schmucks and putzes too. Would they disown you for having a pork chop? That's more forbidden by Torah than what Iris is doing. I hope moving forward you can rebuild your relationship with Iris and distance from the rest of your family.", "NTA for telling your sister, but everyone is the AH for keeping distance because you were \u201cforbidden\u201d from contacting her.  You all should be ashamed. Instead of being decent, you all took the cowards way out and cut contact..  I would rather go with sister than be with a hateful group of people like your family.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re never the asshole for going against homophobia", "YTA.  You should have reached out to your mom and siblings first and let them know you will inform Iris.

You should talk to your sister more and see about getting away from them and joining the rest of Planet Earth that lives in reality.", "I'm torn between N T A and E S H.\n\nNo one gets to override Next-of-Kin, which was your Mom in this situation.  She's at the center of the grief circle.  Her comfort and peace was paramount.  If seeing someone there would distress her, she shouldn't have to.  \n\nHowever, your family has been so shockingly evil that it's hard to consider usual etiquette  I feel terrible that your sister felt the need to subject herself to them for closure.  I don't think she owed it to your Dad or Mom in any way, shape or form.", "NTA, your father has passed so he does care either way, but you gave your sister a chance to say goodbye. Your heart is good and you did right by your sister.", "There's no hate like religious hate. I guess I will never understand how people can abandon their loved ones because of who they choose to love.", "They\u2019re fachnyock.", "OP would have been 6yo when Iris was cut off so that wasn\u2019t a choice they could make. It\u2019s also very easy to say that when you\u2019re not in that position. It sounds like OP did what they could to push for reconciliation as soon as they were old enough to do so. The parents are AH, OP is NTA.", "how dare you call op an asshole when she's the only person in that family outside of her sister who had a soul. fuck what  their father would've wanted. she has as much right to be there as anyone else.", "You don't have any gay people you love in your life do you. OP did cause conflict with her family over it but her family have chosen a cruel hill to die on, and her sister deserves closure as much as anyone else.

But how about you grow up and start showing your sister some support and stop enabling your toxic family members?  Your family are disgusting.", "I also grew up in a religion that practices extreme shunning. I am the one in Iris's situation. If someone didn't tell me that one of my parents died, even if I didn't go to the funeral, I would be absolutely livid. NTA and I hope you can get away from those practices soon", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause \u201cdrama.\u201d Your mother and other siblings did. They could have chosen to welcome your sister as a beloved family member in a time of grief. They could have, at the very least, chosen to ignore her presence and let sleeping dogs lie. But *they* decided to make a big deal out of it, purely because of their bitter hatred for gay people. They turned your father\u2019s funeral into yet another vehicle for their bigotry and contempt. \n\nYou made a loving choice. They made a hateful one. You will never be TA in those circumstances. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m sorry for the way your family is behaving in the aftermath.

YTA. You knew that this would further upset your family on the worst day of their lives. \n\nI don\u2019t approve of how they treated Iris. However what did anybody get out of that? Did you think it would be some grand reunion where everyone hugs and all is forgiven?", "NTA if my family member died I'd want to know even if you're not allowed to speak to me.", "NTA. Catch up with your sister. Your family doesn't deserve her anyway.", "NTA.  My dad once said that funerals are for the living.  They are.  Your father is dead. What he wanted doesn't really matter.", "NTA You are now a grown adult and you get to choose how you want to live your life. You don't have to hurt Iris for your parents anymore.

She does not have to submit requests to the committee for approval before acting.", ">Did you think it would be some grand reunion where everyone hugs and all is forgiven?\n\nI think OP thought Iris deserved as equal a chance as the rest of them to mourn her father.", "I wouldn't go that far to describe me, but thank you. It's basic human decency that we all deserve.", "Except that anyone should be able to foresee that she\u2019d get turfed out immediately. It isn\u2019t as if they\u2019d not notice her and let her mourn. \n\nOP should have known it would have worked out exactly like it did. How is anybody better off for this. Would have made far more sense to offer to meet up at the grave another day."]}
