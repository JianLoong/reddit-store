Does MIL know how busy your job has been lately?\n\nI would just tell MIL I dont have the energy for it this year.

You're not being invited to a party, you're being invited to a family event. Very different situation, very different rules. The question is, with his family, do you want to be considered family or do you want to be considered a guest? This is a very good way to define it, but you will have to live with consequences of this decision in your relationship with his family for the rest of your life.", "YWBTA to show up empty handed for Thanksgiving. It sounds like there are tons of people showing up for their Thanksgiving meal. Expecting one person to host & prep is ridiculous & not what Thanksgiving is about. It is about sharing the harvest where everyone should be bringing a dish. If you don\u2019t want to help, don\u2019t go. Cook your own Thanksgiving meal for your immediate family.", "YWBTA in my opinion. I think it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to help out with any of the prep, but I think it would be cheeky for you to still turn up without helping. \n\nIn my opinion, you either don\u2019t help prep and just don\u2019t go, or you help with prep and go.", "I also wanted to know if it's just the women preparing everything, but then OP clarified that everyone needs to pitch in. \n\nYTA\n\nEveryone is helping out - you don't get to be the princess who rocks up just to eat the food everyone else worked the whole day to prepare.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Are you sure of the ALL kids?

Avoid the hassle all together.", "YWBTA if you show up late and completely disregard the way the family has setup Thanksgiving. You can let MIL know how you are feeling and offer to pay for some of the food and maybe do some minor cooking as your contribution or you can do a separate Thanksgiving celebration with your husband instead of going if he is willing but if you show up hours later while the other kids/spouses help MIL it would be very disrespectful.", "If i were you I would just plead cramps or stomach flu and skip the entire Thanksgiving.

Keep the tradition or don\u2019t go if you\u2019re not up for it this year.", "YTA your husband is right. You are either go and help out or you don't go at all. If you think *helping* to make Thanksgiving for the whole family is too much hard work, imagine having to do it on your own! \n\nIt's okay to be exhausted and to need a break.
