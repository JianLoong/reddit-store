By trying to say now that you dont like the way she and the family \"host\" you are starting major problems that I dont think you really want to start.

Family (in your in laws dynamic) is expected to pitch in and help out, not sit around and watch one person do all the labor and serve everyone else. I'm sure you have had it tough at work and do want to relax ... and I'm equally certain you are not the only person (up to and including MIL) who feels this way about the last month, whether they work or stay at home. In your IL's home, they've recognised this would result in an unequal distribution of labor, with one or two people doing all the prep and work and having no fun, while everyone else socializes, so they've adjusted expectations. Now everyone has an equal share, and the work and socialising are mixed. \n\nAdulting is hard, and everyone wants a day off where they can be a child and let other people coddle and wait on them all day. Hence the existence of restaurants, hotels, and spas (although, ironically, the owners and managers of many of these places appear to be forgetting one reason people come to them is to relax and not do chores, but that's a different rant).\n\nYour husband has offered you an alternative. If you do not want to celebrate Thanksgiving the way his family does it up, then your family can stay home for a lazy Thanksgiving. If you do that, I suggest getting a rotisserie chicken, hawaiian rolls, & pumpkin pie from costco the day before. Stick them in the fridge and pull them out at dinnertime, because the last thing you want to do on lazy Thanksgiving is cook.", "I'm kind of veering NAH\n\nHear me out--this is the expectation of the FAMILY to show up to help and everyone helps. It means you're seen as family, too, not just a guest.

So you don't want to go.\n\nSo don't. Order food for pickup from somewhere and relax. Make reservations somewhere. That's what my family did, we are going out for dinner because we're all getting too old or too decrepit and sick to do all that cooking.", "YTA it isn't a \"party\" it is a family activity.  Everyone is expected to pitch in and help.  You don't want to?  Don't go. Your husband offered a reasonable solution, but you want to just show up after not contributing.  You'd look sideways at another person sitting down and enjoying the meal after doing no work simply because they weren't in the mood to do any of the prep.\n\nIf you go, you help.  If you aren't up for it, stay home.", "Just skip it. I want to show up and be catered to isn't going to go over well. That's how this will be read.", "You should stay home and have the low key day off you want and need.\n\nYou know what takes hours of prep and cook time?

You won't have a \"low key stress free thanksgiving\" fighting with MIL about who should do the work cooking.", "YTA. \n\nYou weren't one until when your husband proposed just not going, you didn't take him up on that offer. \n\nYour inlaws view you as \"family\" and not a \"guest\", so no, it isn't rude or inappropriate for them to host with the idea that the family comes and helps. You like the idea of having a \"day off\" and just showing up as a guest, and I imagine your inlaws would love that too. Your last line makes it seem like you think it is an honor to host, and that they are the ones creating work for everyone else when they should be glad people are coming over. For a lot of people, hosting is a family obligation, not necessarily a great gift. Your inlaws  have decided the best way to handle this holiday is to get all the immediate members to pitch in. If you don't like that, then that's fine, but then you shouldn't attend. \n\nYou aren't obligated to attend however, and you and your husband can have an actual low key thanksgiving by staying home.

Probably you are not the only one with busy life.", "YTA this is their tradition and your husband is offering you an out. A holiday is the worst time for you to make a statement about how you feel about his family. He is giving you a good option, if you just want the food without the participation just look ahead and get it delivered.", "YTA.

Sounds like it's a tradition that EVERYBODY pitches in (the way it's written you're not suggesting \"girls cook, guys watch football\") so you're expecting to roll up when everybody else has done all the work.\n\nAnd why would there be a thank you when literally everybody has been involved in the work?

Just wait until two days before, come down with something, and THEN call your MIL and ask what she would prefer- for you to come closer to the meal or skip this year because you don\u2019t want to make anyone else under the weather. Regardless of which answer you get, you send two bottles of good wine (same wine x2) and a really nice pie from a real bakery along with hubby.\n\nYTA because bringing it up four weeks in advance makes you look like a whiner mooch who doesn\u2019t really want to be around your in-laws, and that\u2019s not a good look for anyone.", "YTA, either skip it all together.

Although I'm left mystified as to how there's enough work, and room in the kitchen, for 6+ people for 6 hours.  \n\nIt's entirely reasonable that you don't have energy to cook and socialize for 6 hours and then socialize for several more hours.  Even if you stayed home, baked some pies at your home and then took them to dinner, it would be more restful.  Tell your husband that the two of you can take two cars.  If he doesn't like that, then he can go without you or stay home with you.  But it's his choice.", "YWBTA this isn't a \"party\" this is a family tradition and everyone helps out. he's agreed to not go and have a low key thanksgiving so that sounds like the best option.", "YTA... your choice is to show up for the cook off OR stay home and skip the event. Your entitlement is showing.", "YTA\n\nIt's not that you don't want to participate in the holiday, it's that your efforts to cover that logically minimize and insult his family tradition, a tradition which happens to be incredibly common.", "YTA.

I know this cause our family used to do this when I was a kid some yrs ago.", "YWBTA, based on how your framing it. The event for your in laws is clearly about the family getting together to prepare a meal. For you the holiday is about eating the meal. You need to communicate how you want to to spend the holiday, it would be rude to go and not participate.", "YTA for sounding like you expect to be catered to at a family event  just because the event is not in your home.

We were all hanging out at my house at the end of September years ago. We all agreed that me and my husband would host Thanksgiving as we had in the past. I grabbed a pad of paper and wrote down what everyone was going to bring. Well, Thanksgiving Day around 1:00pm, my younger sister calls and starts bitching about how we agreed that she would be hosting Thanksgiving! Ummm\u2026no we didn\u2019t. Plans were confirmed three weeks before the big day! While she\u2019s bitching at me, people are arriving to my house. I calmly (she hates that) stated that if she was hosting, why are people walking through my door? I also reminded her that she was bringing the pies for dessert. Needless to say, she cussed me out and hung up. Oh well. I took another relative with me to find an open store to purchase pies. A few years before this, she was supposed to bring dinner rolls. We didn\u2019t have dinner rolls that year. She always hosted Christmas and that in itself was a bitch fest, because if someone brought generic chips and dip to share or the kids were playing too loud it annoyed her. She tried to put on this perfect day. One relative loved deviled eggs. He\u2019d eat four half\u2019s and she\u2019d bitch about that under her breath. Over the years, the gathering dwindled to just me, my hubby, her hubby and her kids/grandkids. Four or five years ago I stopped going all together. We started our own Christmas tradition. Chinese takeout on Christmas Eve and chilling out Christmas morning and then we go to see a movie. \nThanksgiving consists of a small turkey and fixings at home, Macys Day parade on TV and football! No stress or demands.", "Eh...I'm going to go with NAH bordering on YTA. This isn't a situation where only women have to help. By your comment, everyone has to help so there's no misogynistic agenda here. Essentially in exchange for hosting and presumably paying for everyone to eat, the expectation is that everyone contributes to making the food. \n\nI agree with your husband's suggestion; if you don't want to help, don't go. He's not forcing you. If you want to go and just eat while everyone else does all the work it is too much like The Little Red Hen story.", "Nta just fake a sickness and order in for yourself.

It's interesting that your husband was the one who brought up not going, I wonder if he is just as unenthusiastic about going as you.
