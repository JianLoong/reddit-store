One of my coworkers has a daughter that just moved here - and started working at the same place.

It's good if you want to help your family (if you can) and genuinely want to but if you're not in that status yet, you shouldn't be forced to do so. \n\nAdults (parents) need to fully realize it's their choice to have children so, they are responsible for their needs not the other way around. Just because they did all they could to raise their kids, they would demand them to fully support them in return. But then again, it's case to case basis. Some parents aren't capable anymore to help themselves for many reasons such as illnesses or l", "NTA\n\nEvery time my husband asks something of his mom she says \"just remember this when I'm old!\" Even when my husband has cancer at 22 he asked her to drive him to an appointment it was the same comment demeaning and mind you his parents are in their mid 60's and we are in our mid 20s just starting our life. That kind of pressure and responsibility isn't fair to our young children. If you are a good loving parent and never made it a point of expectation despite everything else or a tally of REASONS why your kids have to then most children won't blink at trying to help take care of their parents that have always loved them and took care of them. However the comments when he had cancer and other situations like when I was in the hospital having surgery doesn't make us want to help them because itsy almost as if shes only helping us to gain tallys. \n\nSo I vote NTA don't parent your child with the sole expectation for a retirement income..that's a good way to brew resentment and the child not feel unconditionally supported", "NTA.   And at first I misread the title, I thought it said that children are not cremated so the adults can have a great  retirement.  I guess that\u2019s a whole other subject lol.", "Thank you for the advice. I have since removed myself from that conversation.", "This was not on Facebook.", "LOL - you mean not mooching off your kids? I have a SIL who does that - thinks that her kids exist to support her, and that's in Canada.", "I don\u2019t live in the West now. I only went to school there. I only mentioned this because I have heard the same complaints coming from many locals here who have never been to the West themselves and they think this is a little toxic to demand of the kids from the parents.", "Nta. Filial piety is a joke. Your children shouldn't have to support you financially in your old age. Good for you breaking the cycle and living your best life.  Go low contact with those who disagree.", "Start sending pron or something in the gc when they say stuff like that. Make them uncomfortable", "NTA. BTW only CEOs make 1mil a year not engineer's. Plus CEOs make about 550k a year and the rest in a bonus and in a housing bonus. Regular computer science you're looking at 150 to 250k depending on experience and how good you are and more or less a PHD. So they have a wild imagination on the tech industry and the pay. Many people in the trades make as much as an engineer without college and without debt and can retire young with a pension. You won't have a pension in tech, at least not enough to live comfortably off of, if you do get one. Don't get me wrong I love being in tech but there's a lot people don't know about the pay. When you're out of school, you want to look for benefits, health care plans and a 401k match. The tech industry in many cases, relies on the economy doing well, so keep that in mind too. But overall it really is a fun industry and there is so much you can do and have fun with the different projects. If you do want to help your family, don't live near the coast, live in the middle of the country and ask for 150k. You'll have a much better quality of life but thays also not a starting wage. More like 80 to 95k.", "NTA. parents aren't obligated to have their kids pressured into taking care of them, that's not what having children is for.", "So, sexually harass their own family members?", "If they expect their kids to wipe their asses one day? Fuck yes", "NTA.   \nThese outdated ideas only stop if enough people refuse.", "Holy shit I read this as cremated", "Unless your parents are assholes or abusive, it\u2019s really quite selfish of you to not want to support them in old age.", "I think it needed to be called out if for no one else's sake then so the cousin knew that Someone would be on their side if they wanted their own life.  Toxic culture only changes when it's called out."]}
