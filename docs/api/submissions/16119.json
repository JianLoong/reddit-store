Your relationship doesn't seem healthy at all as you've been posting about it and his behaviors for nearly three years.\n\n3 months ago you posted:\n\n> \"Have you offended yourself?\" This is a question my (26F) boyfriend (27M) asked me tonight over the phone\u2026 I don\u2019t know if this is gaslighting behaviour?\n\n> He has said I\u2019m putting words in his mouth.\n\n> I\u2019m so upset and I\u2019ve been in an abusive relationship before, and I don\u2019t know if the same is starting to happen again and I just can\u2019t see it, or if I\u2019m being overly sensitive.\n\n4 months ago you posted that he has no life plans, and also:\n\n> He said he doesn\u2019t want to contribute towards my home as he would be bettering me and not bettering himself - which is frustrating as he\u2019s sending so many mixed messages. I\u2019ve said we would work bills and expenses fairly and in proportion to our earnings, but he\u2019s still very vague about his opinions on this.\n\n> Currently he contributes \u00a3200 per month, but I spend all of that on groceries and food for us on the weekends.\n\n> He\u2019s been \u201cpromised\u201d a new job at his current workplace\u2026 but he\u2019s been promised \u00a310k salary increases before which have turned out to be \u00a32k\u2026 so I don\u2019t really trust what his work say. He enjoys his work, especially socially, so I don\u2019t want him to leave if he enjoys it.\n\n> Tonight he\u2019s told me he does really want to live in with me\u2026 but I just don\u2019t know how long I can go on like this.

I own my home, he doesn\u2019t pay me any rent, or contribute towards groceries or bills etc. He literally lives here rent free.\n\n> He\u2019s just called me and told me how excited he is for his PlayStation tomorrow evening that I\u2019m picking up, and the first thing he\u2019s going to do is put it on and play it when he gets to mine !\n\n> I said how I find that really disrespectful that he thinks he can walk into my house, use my electricity, play the PlayStation that I\u2019ve picked up for him on my television in my lounge. When I asked what he expects me to do when he\u2019s on his PlayStation he said I could just do some work emails \u2026\n\n> I hate to throw the fact that it\u2019s my house in his face, but it really got to me. I don\u2019t have a spare television that I could watch, and I don\u2019t particularly fancy watching him play.\n\n> On top of this, he owes me around \u00a3500 for a holiday we went on. So it\u2019s even more frustrating that he\u2019s prioritised buying this PlayStation instead of partially paying me back.\n\n> I feel really guilty that we\u2019ve had an augment about this, but also feel he really don\u2019t care about me and he\u2019s putting himself first.\n\n> TLDR: AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to play PlayStation?\n\n2 years, 8 months ago you posted, thankfully because the post is very long:\n\n> TL;DR: a lad who I\u2019ve spoke to for 4 weeks, met up 4 times (weekly), texts me daily, wants to carry on as we are but doesn\u2019t want a relationship?\n\nThe highest-rated comment to that post is \"As soon as he got sex, he started being distant and things changed.
