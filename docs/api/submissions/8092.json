We share a two bedroom apartment and have lived together for 2 years now. Up until now, we have gotten along pretty well.\n\nMy roommate has an elderly cat. The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn\u2019t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other.\n\nMy roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up.\n\nWell, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :)\n\nOur roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there. \n\nUnfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems.\n\nWe asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone. It\u2019s gotten so bad that my girlfriend is crying and considering taking the kitten back to the shelter.

They need time to accept a new cat roommate.", "YTA for bringing a pet into a shared home without discussing it with your roommate, and frankly doing it without any consideration for her cat or your kitten. \n\nI have 5 cats and I\u2019ve been around the block a few times when it comes to introducing new cats & getting harmony. \n\n1. You don\u2019t just throw cats together and wait for them to work it out. They aren\u2019t dogs. You take it slowly, especially if one of them has lived the majority of their lives alone. I have 3 extremely outgoing friendly cats that I use to socialize rescues. If I threw a kitten into my house with no warning today 2 of them would be hissing and swatting because of the shock. \n\n2. Kittens don\u2019t need free reign of a home or apartment. They should actually be limited when they aren\u2019t in your direct supervision anyways. They love to do dumb things like chewing up cords, chewing & eating plastic, getting stuck behind the fridge, etc. Until you\u2019ve gotten to know them they shouldn\u2019t be out unattended anyways. \n\n3. Kittens need to be socialized and if they don\u2019t have another cat to play with they can be terrible. Every rescue I\u2019ve worked with either insists you get two kittens or make sure you are taking a kitten home to an already social cat. \n\n4. Kittens are social, so it\u2019s unlikely your kitten is simply existing. It\u2019s probably trying to play with older cat, and doing it whether older cat likes it or not. Kittens play by hunting/stalking/wrestling, it\u2019s universal. Kitten is probably annoying older cat trying to play. \n\n5. Unless kitten is being full on attacked by older cat it\u2019s actually probably fine. Cats hiss. They swat. Even friendly cats aren\u2019t cuddling together 24/7. \n\nSo in conclusion, quarantine your kitten to your room unless you are home and supervising. Older cat should have somewhere that is inaccessible to the kitten. Kitten is learning social norms, and part of that is being hissed at and swatted. Cats that dislike each other will probably learn to exist separately in the same place if introduced slowly & properly.", "YTA - the older cat was there first and your roommate warned you that he did not like other cats.

Her cat is elderly and has been living there already, it's basically his flat, and to expect an elderly pet to be confined to one room is cruel, selfish and unfair for him. You also sound selfish for not understanding cat behaviour and just bringing one on a whim without even talking or trying out if they get along with each other.

They are buggy - they will follow them around mimicking, practice play pouncing at their feet etc. When an older cat hisses at a young cat or lightly swats, it is an example of boundary setting, and a way of letting the kitten know who\u2019s the boss. Young cats need to learn that not every cat (or animal) is their friend - that is something that needs to be learned early. I genuinely believe you are doing a disservice to your cat by not allowing them to socialize in any capacity. He could be seriously harmed one day because he couldn\u2019t take the hint from a much larger cat. \n\nI will say, it does sound like you folks may need to assess your own boundaries with animals.

Your roommate told you her cat does not like other cats. It is entirely possible your roommate\u2019s cat has trauma to other cats and may never ever get around to liking cats. Furthermore, kittens can be super obnoxious and annoying to older cats! Kittens bite way too hard and often and do not understand how to play. Older cats often feel a need to put younger cats in their place and establish hierarchy in the same household. Some even get so depressed and anxious by a new kitten in the house they start acting out with their owners and start behaving strangely. If you had a conversation with your roommate and done any research at all you probably would have known this. Not only has your adoption messed with your roommate and inconvenienced her, you have also impacted the older cat already accustomed to the house AND your new kitten.\n\nIf you have a shot at fixing this, you need to research and slowly introduce your cats to each other. They will probably not like each other, but maybe they will tolerate each other. Someone here suggested Jackson Galaxy, Kitten Lady may also be a good resource.

We share a two bedroom apartment and have lived together for 2 years now. Up until now, we have gotten along pretty well.\n\nMy roommate has an elderly cat. The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn\u2019t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other.\n\nMy roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up.\n\nWell, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :)\n\nOur roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there. \n\nUnfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems.\n\nWe asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone.

She was getting to where she couldn't get around that well (and I had to recently take her to the rainbow bridge :( ... ), but things escalated when I got a kitten two years ago.  At first my old cat was okay with it, but then he just got way too energetic.  \n\nHe really just wanted to play, but the idiots who had her (my elderly cat) before me had had her declawed (argh!), so she couldn't really \"school\" him the way she should have been able to.\n\nSo she eventually got to the point where she was all \"my kingdom!\" and would mostly stay in the bedroom.  She'd come out during the day, and stay in the office because she knew I'd protect her from his rambunctiousness...but she eventually got to the point where she was happy with her beds, her kitty box and her own little food and water bowl in the bedroom and she just wouldn't come out in the morning when I went to work.\n\nSorry, that was a lot of backstory.  The point is, your roommate's elderly cat will probably feel more secure in her \"own little kingdom.\"  It's not going to be an inconvenience for her, at all.

Kittens want to play, they want to hug, they want to love nip, they just want to have interaction. I have two older cats, and a younger cat. Even though we slow intro'd them, he still was a kitten when we got him and when the younger cat was little, he would \"flying bear hug\" the other two. They don't particularly like it, but the dog loves it, so he now plays more with the dog, but occasionally still wants to \"hug\" his siblings, and while they don't like it, they tolerate him better now that they know each other better.", "Can I ask why it\u2019s not HER responsibility to find a solution since her cat is the one with the behavioral issue?

This is an extremely common dynamic. Kittens want to play. Older cats don\u2019t. The older cat is communicating boundaries and has every right to do so. YOUR cat was happier in one room and showed you as such. This cat clearly does not want that as it is fighting back instead of running away. Cats are like people in that they\u2019re all different. Fight or flight is real in cats too, it\u2019s just prey vs hunter. This guy knew the older cat didn\u2019t like other cats. It is not aggressive.

Instead of forcing the long term residence to confine to her room, you should properly introduce them. Just because \"the kitten just wants to play\" doesn't mean she's not annoying. I have 2 dogs and adopted an adolescent dog last year, he's sweet and he means no harm but he pissed our 2 dogs off unsupervised, it took months of bonding for them to start liking each other. You should keep your kitten in your room and slowing and consistently re-introduce them. For example, ask your roommate if you could be in charge of feeding time, feed one cat in the room next to the door and the other outside the door, if they act stressed, increase the distance, if they're comfortable, replace the door wall with a baby gate. when they're comfortable face to face, have play sections with both.", "You sound like you don\u2019t know a lot about cats.
