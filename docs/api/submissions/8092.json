{"id": 8092, "submission_id": "10jot1f", "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to keep her cat in her bedroom?", "selftext": "I (24F) live with my girlfriend (25F) and a roommate (23F). We share a two bedroom apartment and have lived together for 2 years now. Up until now, we have gotten along pretty well.\n\nMy roommate has an elderly cat. The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn\u2019t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other.\n\nMy roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up.\n\nWell, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :)\n\nOur roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there. \n\nUnfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems.\n\nWe asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone. It\u2019s gotten so bad that my girlfriend is crying and considering taking the kitten back to the shelter. So here I am to get an outside perspective because idk what to think now.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: So I am definitely the AH. The comments have really helped me to understand that my roommate\u2019s cat is just acting\u2026 well, like a cat! I am willing to admit I was ignorant and impulsive. I have never had a pet before and should have done more research before jumping into pet ownership. I plan to sincerely apologize to my roommate. She is willing to talk once she gets home from work. I am going to see if she\u2019s willing to try a proper introduction for both kitties and Banana Pudding will be staying in our room for the duration while her kitty will be able to roam. I am hopeful that things will work out and I want to thank everyone for being blunt and educating me. I was impulsive and inconsiderate, but my roommate is a great person and I think she will forgive us and be willing to try to make it work.\n\nEDIT #2: Roommate and I have talked. I apologized to her for being selfish, ignorant, and for putting her cat in an uncomfortable situation. She forgave me and said she\u2019d be happy to help do a proper introduction between the kitties. She said that if we do things slowly and carefully, her cat might be able to accept Banana Pudding. For now, our kitten will be staying in our room for the introduction process. She also taught me a little bit about cat body language and guys\u2026 her cat came and sat in my lap! She even purred! My roommate is a very kind and forgiving person and I\u2019m very thankful that she chose to forgive me after I was such a huge AH to her. She played with Banana Pudding and gave me some cat food recommendations. I think things are gonna work out.

They need time to accept a new cat roommate.", "YTA for bringing a pet into a shared home without discussing it with your roommate, and frankly doing it without any consideration for her cat or your kitten. \n\nI have 5 cats and I\u2019ve been around the block a few times when it comes to introducing new cats & getting harmony. \n\n1. You don\u2019t just throw cats together and wait for them to work it out. They aren\u2019t dogs. You take it slowly, especially if one of them has lived the majority of their lives alone. I have 3 extremely outgoing friendly cats that I use to socialize rescues. If I threw a kitten into my house with no warning today 2 of those 3 would be hissing and swatting because of the shock. The other 2 would be unbelievably pissed. \n\n2. Kittens don\u2019t need free reign of a home or apartment. They should actually be limited when they aren\u2019t in your direct supervision anyways. They love to do dumb things like chewing up cords, chewing & eating plastic, getting stuck behind the fridge, etc. Until you\u2019ve gotten to know them they shouldn\u2019t be out unattended anyways. \n\n3. Kittens need to be socialized and if they don\u2019t have another cat to play with they can be terrible. Every rescue I\u2019ve worked with either insists you get two kittens or make sure you are taking a kitten home to an already social cat. \n\n4. Kittens are social, so it\u2019s unlikely your kitten is simply existing. It\u2019s probably trying to play with older cat, and doing it whether older cat likes it or not. Kittens play by hunting/stalking/wrestling, it\u2019s universal. Kitten is probably annoying older cat trying to play. \n\n5. Unless kitten is being full on attacked by older cat it\u2019s actually probably fine. Cats hiss. They swat. Even friendly cats aren\u2019t cuddling together 24/7. \n\nSo in conclusion, quarantine your kitten to your room unless you are home and supervising. Older cat should have somewhere that is inaccessible to the kitten. Kitten is learning social norms, and part of that is being hissed at and swatted. Cats that dislike each other will probably learn to exist separately in the same place if introduced slowly & properly.\n\nETA: some clarification.

Her cat is elderly and has been living there already, it's basically his flat, and to expect an elderly pet to be confined to one room is cruel, selfish and unfair for him. You also sound selfish for not understanding cat behaviour and just bringing one on a whim without even talking or trying out if they get along with each other.

Your cat gets hurt and it\u2019s on you.", "YTA - I am going to wager you went somewhere that didn't do a pet adoption interview, or if they did that you lied to them. Because animal adoption people want to make sure what conditions an animal is going home to, and the conditions you have are not good for a new animal, or for the older animal.   \n\n\nThey also recommend that you introduce an animal slowly to a new place, which means you should have had the kitten in your room, and had a blanket or something that the kitten could sleep on, and the older cat should have a blanket it could sleep on, and that you exchange them so that they can get used to each other's scent.  \n\n\nAlso, you should be keeping the kitten in your room if there is a problem, because the older cat is less likely to be flexible. You've already established that you are not willing to respect its boundaries, and then you bring in a new KITTEN to a house with an only cat, a SENIOR only cat at that.  \n\n\nYou couldn't be any more irresponsible of a pet owner than you've established in your post.

Older cats, just like older humans, get irritated with the littles ones sometimes. They are buggy - they will follow them around mimicking, practice play pouncing at their feet etc. When an older cat hisses at a young cat or lightly swats, it is an example of boundary setting, and a way of letting the kitten know who\u2019s the boss. Young cats need to learn that not every cat (or animal) is their friend - that is something that needs to be learned early. I genuinely believe you are doing a disservice to your cat by not allowing them to socialize in any capacity. He could be seriously harmed one day because he couldn\u2019t take the hint from a much larger cat. \n\nI will say, it does sound like you folks may need to assess your own boundaries with animals.

Your roommate told you her cat does not like other cats. It is entirely possible your roommate\u2019s cat has trauma to other cats and may never ever get around to liking cats. Furthermore, kittens can be super obnoxious and annoying to older cats! Kittens bite way too hard and often and do not understand how to play. Older cats often feel a need to put younger cats in their place and establish hierarchy in the same household. Some even get so depressed and anxious by a new kitten in the house they start acting out with their owners and start behaving strangely. If you had a conversation with your roommate and done any research at all you probably would have known this. Not only has your adoption messed with your roommate and inconvenienced her, you have also impacted the older cat already accustomed to the house AND your new kitten.\n\nIf you have a shot at fixing this, you need to research and slowly introduce your cats to each other.

The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn\u2019t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other.\n\nMy roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up.\n\nWell, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :)\n\nOur roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there. \n\nUnfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems.\n\nWe asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone.

And expecting your roommate to lock up their cat all day is another AH move. That cat needs space, not just a bedroom.

The elderly cat can't be expected to rot in one room for the rest of its life because you got a kitten without learning about how to properly introduce them. As a volunteer for a cat group, I've had to make less than great spacing work to avoid euthanasia. Let her elderly cat have the run of the apartment for the majority of the day. Ask her to have an hour in the AM and PM to let your kitten play and get out the zoomies and let the cats smell each other. If it doesn't go well, continue that arrangement until the lease is up and move. Offer to pay for those multicat pheromone diffusers and calming treats or stuff she feels would help her cat to feel safe and calm. Cats are territorial and you have created a situation in which her cat feels very threatened.\n\n If you return the kitten, be aware because it is an \"owner surrender\" and doesn't need to be held for a stray hold; in some shelters, when every cage is full but other animals have stray holds, they will have to euthanize an animal like your kitten even if one of those on a stray hole to seems totally feral and unadoptable because it is the only one it is legal for them to euthanize. I would read your adoption contract. Some shelters require that the animal be returned to them but still run into the situation above; If that is the case you should locate in a doctor that needs all of their requirements and then contact the shelter to have them re-adopt the animal to that person.", "God I can\u2019t stand people like you.

In addition, it appears that you didn't even bother to research how to properly introduce two cats into the same household.   This is always a slow and painstaking process.    I've done it multiple times and it has always started with the new cat confined to a single room at the start as you very gradually get the felines used to each other and increase the time they spend together.  A single room will feel like a huge space to kitten who has been living in a kennel at the shelter.   On the other hand, locking a adult cat that has had the run or the whole apartment away in a room will cause it stress and make the introduction even harder.   Apologize to your roommate.  Do some research on how to properly introduce cats and come up with a plan together for how you will proceed.", "YTA you've treated your roommate pretty awfully as well as both cats involved. You've bought a kitten on a whim without even a thought on integrating her into the house and you've put her in a potentially dangerous situation. They're animals not cuddly toys.

You chose to bring a new cat into a living arrangement that already had a cat\u2014one you were previously told doesn\u2019t get along with other pets. IMO it\u2019s already an AH move to bring any pet into an apartment where not everyone gave the OK, especially an animal like a cat that doesn\u2019t have an enclosed living area (e.g., a terrarium). Cats especially can be highly territorial. It took 3 years for mine and my partner\u2019s cats to get along when we moved in together, and we had previously discussed how best to introduce them and create spaces so they\u2019re all comfortable. You made this situation, not your roommate. It\u2019s not at all fair to have her cat be confined to a single space when you knowingly created this problem. You can confine your new cat so that it\u2019s not interacting with the old one, bring it back to the shelter, or move out.

This home is her territory, and she is defending the only way she knows how.  You say that your kitten keeps approaching and trying to play with the older cat, but that is also a \"behavioral issue\" because the kitten is ignoring the cat's clear signals that it wants to be left alone, and is bothering it.

You didn't care how roommate felt, how the cat felt, how the new kitten would feel being thrown into a new home with an unwelcoming older cat, or even how you and your gf would really feel dealing with this situation. You wanted, you took. You lied (by omission - to your roommate, and I'm assuming to the shelter staff too - there's no way you said \"there's already a cat long-established in the home who has a history of hostility to other cats\").

And now, when laying in the bed you've entirely made yourself is uncomfortable, your proposed solution is to abandon your new family member back at the shelter. \n\nYou need to do some growing up - now. Both those cats and your roommate deserve a LOT more caring and respect than you've shown them so far. Time for you to give whatever time, effort or other sacrifice you need to either make the home safe and happy for both cats, or for you and your gf to find another home. Do NOT displace your roommate, do NOT reduce her cats quality of life to nothing being boxed in a single room, and do NOT abandon your new cat back at the shelter.

If you were so attached to this cat you\u2019ve had for a few DAYS\u2026 and felt like your kitten has rights to the home and you shouldn\u2019t have to move out\u2026 how did you think she felt about her cat she\u2019s had for YEARS? Like comparatively, why did you think you had even a toe to stand on let alone a leg? \n\nShe has loved her cat 100x harder than you love yours based simply on time alone. Think about the total sum of memories, the special bond, financial care and medical treatment she\u2019s put into her beloved pet. Not to mention the countless hours she\u2019s spent learning about cat behavior to be the best pet owner she could be. She warned you she was a solo cat owner and made sure to not sign a lease with another pet owner for her cats well-being and you completely dismissed that. \n\n2. What made you think she would be ok with shoving her pet away in a bedroom indefinitely just because you don\u2019t like it? And, why didn\u2019t you care at all for the well-being of her cat as much as your own - just on the basis of it being another living thing? \n\nPlease spend as much time as you plan learning about cat behavior, learning and practicing empathy for others. You showed so little empathy for your roommate and both cats when you made this series of choices and then even doubled down for awhile when you made this post because you couldn\u2019t fathom that their needs could outweigh your wants. \n\nLife isn\u2019t only about gratifying our individual desires. The people and living things in your environment deserve consideration *always*. Not just when it\u2019s convenient. You were selfish and manipulative throughout this whole ordeal and both pets will suffer for it - even if only temporarily. I hope if the intros go poorly you will find a new home for your kitten or move out. I hope you will also apply this to future decisions you make and be more mature overall. It\u2019s a big responsibility to take care of a living animal.", "okay, that's a great start op. i worked as a cat caretaker before, so i know introducing a younger cat to a senior cat will often be challenging depending on the cats' temperaments. the goal is to have them to be able to at least be okay with being in the same space so seeing that your roomie's cat has gotten familiar with you is already a good sign. i hope the cats will be friends soon enough \ud83d\udc4d", "I have had a cat for 22 years (yes she is ancient) and she has NEVER liked being picked up, and really only in very recent years (probably just too old to care anymore) has she begun to sorta tolerate strangers. \nShe now tolerates being lifted when she can\u2019t get up somewhere she wants to go - but only when she demands it.\n\nShe\u2019s the best cat ever \u2764\ufe0f", "Eh.

By the end of the day, guest dog came up and asked for a pet! That dog is skittish (jumped a little every time I got up to use the restroom or get a drink), but not forcing interaction on it, while having another dog demonstrating that I can be trusted, convinced it that I'm generally a person they can put their trust in.

That\u2019s just cats. That\u2019s how they are. Does that mean you should never have a new pet\u2026 EVER? No. The old cat will eventually get used to the new pet, but you have to give it time. Your roommate might have to keep her cat in a separate room for awhile until the kitten gets old enough to defend itself. Not a big price to pay.

The older cat is going to be grumpy at first. Mine have always been the same way. With a little help and a lot of love things will be just fine. Place some things the baby kitty has played on around the place so the older cat can get use to the kittens scent. Slowly work in small times of the two being out. Just make sure you are watching at all times. Let the  older cat know it's okay and even give her treats when she shows signs of warming up to the baby. Let her know she is doing something right. \n\nIt's not right to go behind the other pet owners back. It's also very selfish of her to think only she is allowed to have an animal. It's selfish for only her animal to have full house rights. If you let the cats roam at different times during the day they will start to get use to the scent and accept it. Do intervals. Do not just lock one cat up days on end that is absolutely insane and inhumane. \n\nPlease know you are absolutely a great person. We all make mistakes. The best we can do is work together to make a common ground. Good luck on your new kitty. I hope everything works out and the two can become best friends. Maybe it is just what the older cat needs.

Your cat may be fine with other animals now but in 3 years when your cat is settled he may NOT be fine with other animals automatically. I used to work in a shelter and I cannot tell you how many times people brought in recently adopted animals because their older pet at home wasn\u2019t magically and immediately adapted to a new being in their house. Or worse, they would give up the older animal. You should not ever, ever, ever introduce an animal to a home with other animals without significant forethought.

They tolerate each other now. They don't fight except the play fighting and chasing kind (you learn real quickly how to tell the difference) but for the most part ignore each other. They're not cats who groom each other and curl up and cuddle together. They're pretty friendly to people though! They love pets and cuddles from us. One loves being held and even loves belly rubs (which is definitely not most cats) the other will sit on your lap or up against you but hates feeling restrained (but will let my husband pick him up and hold him)\n\nThat one that only lets my husband pick him up was mine for two years before he ever even moved in! My husband is also the only one who can trim his claws. That cat was very quiet until he moved in. Now he's pretty vocal lol. He'll meow at us and respond when we talk to him. It's like he just found his person. The other one is a ragdoll and will fall asleep in my arms and sleeps next to me every night. And he's the territorial one. There are a lot of outdoor cats in our neighborhood and if he sees one outside near the house he gets really mad. Once we were outside on our enclosed porch with them and one came right up to the screened window, I don't think I've ever seen my cat so pissed! He's a bit more skittish if there's a lot of noise or too many people around though so he'll watch from a distance (which doesn't really happen much anymore, I can't remember the last time we really had people over) even though he can be friendly, while the other one wants to hang out with everyone and be in the same room but not always be touched by the strangers if there are too many of them at once. We always say even though both were mine to start with, they've chosen favorites. One definitely prefers my husband and the other one is definitely my baby.\n\nOne time I had to take one to the vet and a groomer and he got a lion cut (I have long hairs) and a bath the other cat hissed at him and ran away every time he saw him for a few weeks because he looked and smelled different. Never attacked him but was more afraid I think. That's all it takes. My cats are both big breeds too so they're bigger than a lot of small dogs.

An elderly cat who isn't used to being picked up, or picked up by strangers could really hate it and start associations with you and your gf and bad things incoming. Glad that you're learning.\n\nWatch some Jackson Galaxy videos about cat introductions. He does good informational stuff on YouTube, or there's his show My Cat From Hell where he deals with problematic cats, a lot of which is misunderstandings by the humans, theres a few episodes about introducing (or reintroducing) cats.", "Reading after the update so I can say NTA because you were willing to listen to criticism and advice.\n\nJust one extra thing - it actually might suit your kitten to have an elderly cat around to keep it in check. The only way for kittens to learn that biting is sore is to get swatted or bitten back by another cat.", "You are right. All I can do now is try to not be an AH in the future! Thanks to Reddit and my roommate, I think I\u2019m on the right track.", "this! \n\nI love pets, cats in particular and i try my best to learn about their character, what they enjoy and what not, and i have yet to meet a cat that does not like me. When OP says the cat doesn't like her, that alone tells me OP is some sort of asshole (to the cat). Narcissists will have a hard time around cats\n\ne.g. Some cats hate to be picked up. The thing is: they know what you usually do to them and if that is \"picking the cat up\" (or whtaever you want) and the cates feels uncomfortable being picked up.. well she's going to avoid you.\n\nIf the cat knows you respect its boundaries, or even know when to pet, when to leave alone or when to ignore, the cat will feel super comfortable around you.", "I also agree with this I have elderly female cat and then took in two male kittens. It\u2019s been over a year and she still growls at them and swats them if they get into her personal space. But they can also all be in the same room peacefully with each other. But I also took the time to properly introduce them over the course of many weeks. It\u2019s absolutely cruel to force an elderly cat who\u2019s had free reign of his or her home for all this time into one room. Also any deviation from an elderly cat\u2019s normal routine can cause them stress and make them stop eating which is horrible. If anything OP is TA for not bothering to do any type of research about pet ownership or how to integrate a new pet into a home with an existing one.", "Zinny is a great cat name though. I can't even think of a decent cat name out of banana pudding (pretty sure the rec is 2 syllables and ending in a :y or -i sound)."]}
