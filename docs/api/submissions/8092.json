We share a two bedroom apartment and have lived together for 2 years now. Up until now, we have gotten along pretty well.\n\nMy roommate has an elderly cat. The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn\u2019t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other.\n\nMy roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up.\n\nWell, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :)\n\nOur roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there. \n\nUnfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems.\n\nWe asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone. It\u2019s gotten so bad that my girlfriend is crying and considering taking the kitten back to the shelter. So here I am to get an outside perspective because idk what to think now.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: So I am definitely the AH. The comments have really helped me to understand that my roommate\u2019s cat is just acting\u2026 well, like a cat! I am willing to admit I was ignorant and impulsive. I have never had a pet before and should have done more research before jumping into pet ownership. I plan to sincerely apologize to my roommate. She is willing to talk once she gets home from work. I am going to see if she\u2019s willing to try a proper introduction for both kitties and Banana Pudding will be staying in our room for the duration while her kitty will be able to roam. I am hopeful that things will work out and I want to thank everyone for being blunt and educating me. I was impulsive and inconsiderate, but my roommate is a great person and I think she will forgive us and be willing to try to make it work.", "created_utc": 1674511136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jot1f/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_keep_her_cat_in/", "score": 1203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The main rule of introducing a new cat: put them in a separate room, let the old cat adjust to the smell, let the old cat get interested, start letting the new cat out of their room after a couple of weeks and never let them interact without you present. If the old cat is angry, evacuate the new cat and repeat later. The old cat needs to know the new one isn't taking its territory. Cats are very territorial. They need time to accept a new cat roommate.", "YTA for bringing a pet into a shared home without discussing it with your roommate, and frankly doing it without any consideration for her cat or your kitten. \n\nI have 5 cats and I\u2019ve been around the block a few times when it comes to introducing new cats & getting harmony. \n\n1. You don\u2019t just throw cats together and wait for them to work it out. They aren\u2019t dogs. You take it slowly, especially if one of them has lived the majority of their lives alone. I have 3 extremely outgoing friendly cats that I use to socialize rescues. If I threw a kitten into my house with no warning today 2 of them would be hissing and swatting because of the shock. \n\n2. Kittens don\u2019t need free reign of a home or apartment. They should actually be limited when they aren\u2019t in your direct supervision anyways. They love to do dumb things like chewing up cords, chewing & eating plastic, getting stuck behind the fridge, etc. Until you\u2019ve gotten to know them they shouldn\u2019t be out unattended anyways. \n\n3. Kittens need to be socialized and if they don\u2019t have another cat to play with they can be terrible. Every rescue I\u2019ve worked with either insists you get two kittens or make sure you are taking a kitten home to an already social cat. \n\n4. Kittens are social, so it\u2019s unlikely your kitten is simply existing. It\u2019s probably trying to play with older cat, and doing it whether older cat likes it or not. Kittens play by hunting/stalking/wrestling, it\u2019s universal. Kitten is probably annoying older cat trying to play. \n\n5. Unless kitten is being full on attacked by older cat it\u2019s actually probably fine. Cats hiss. They swat. Even friendly cats aren\u2019t cuddling together 24/7. \n\nSo in conclusion, quarantine your kitten to your room unless you are home and supervising. Older cat should have somewhere that is inaccessible to the kitten. Kitten is learning social norms, and part of that is being hissed at and swatted. Cats that dislike each other will probably learn to exist separately in the same place if introduced slowly & properly.", "YTA - the older cat was there first and your roommate warned you that he did not like other cats. Instead of having any kind of conversation, you just brought home a kitten and now expect an elderly cat to be confined to one room for the rest of his life. You are most indeed the assholes here.

First, the cat is not \"mean\" just because it does not like to be picked up or petted by you. It's a pet with it's own preferences, which is completely normal.

Her cat is elderly and has been living there already, it's basically his flat, and to expect an elderly pet to be confined to one room is cruel, selfish and unfair for him. You also sound selfish for not understanding cat behaviour and just bringing one on a whim without even talking or trying out if they get along with each other.

Because animal adoption people want to make sure what conditions an animal is going home to, and the conditions you have are not good for a new animal, or for the older animal.   \n\n\nThey also recommend that you introduce an animal slowly to a new place, which means you should have had the kitten in your room, and had a blanket or something that the kitten could sleep on, and the older cat should have a blanket it could sleep on, and that you exchange them so that they can get used to each other's scent.  \n\n\nAlso, you should be keeping the kitten in your room if there is a problem, because the older cat is less likely to be flexible. You've already established that you are not willing to respect its boundaries, and then you bring in a new KITTEN to a house with an only cat, a SENIOR only cat at that.  \n\n\nYou couldn't be any more irresponsible of a pet owner than you've established in your post.

Older cats, just like older humans, get irritated with the littles ones sometimes. They are buggy - they will follow them around mimicking, practice play pouncing at their feet etc. When an older cat hisses at a young cat or lightly swats, it is an example of boundary setting, and a way of letting the kitten know who\u2019s the boss. Young cats need to learn that not every cat (or animal) is their friend - that is something that needs to be learned early. I genuinely believe you are doing a disservice to your cat by not allowing them to socialize in any capacity. He could be seriously harmed one day because he couldn\u2019t take the hint from a much larger cat. \n\nI will say, it does sound like you folks may need to assess your own boundaries with animals.

I'd either be looking to break the lease or get the landlord to remove permission for the kitten.", "YTA. Your roommate and her cat were there first. Your roommate told you her cat does not like other cats. It is entirely possible your roommate\u2019s cat has trauma to other cats and may never ever get around to liking cats. Furthermore, kittens can be super obnoxious and annoying to older cats! Kittens bite way too hard and often and do not understand how to play. Older cats often feel a need to put younger cats in their place and establish hierarchy in the same household. Some even get so depressed and anxious by a new kitten in the house they start acting out with their owners and start behaving strangely. If you had a conversation with your roommate and done any research at all you probably would have known this. Not only has your adoption messed with your roommate and inconvenienced her, you have also impacted the older cat already accustomed to the house AND your new kitten.\n\nIf you have a shot at fixing this, you need to research and slowly introduce your cats to each other. They will probably not like each other, but maybe they will tolerate each other. Someone here suggested Jackson Galaxy, Kitten Lady may also be a good resource.

The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn\u2019t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other.\n\nMy roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up.\n\nWell, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :)\n\nOur roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there. \n\nUnfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems.\n\nWe asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone.

Ask her to have an hour in the AM and PM to let your kitten play and get out the zoomies and let the cats smell each other. If it doesn't go well, continue that arrangement until the lease is up and move. Offer to pay for those multicat pheromone diffusers and calming treats or stuff she feels would help her cat to feel safe and calm. Cats are territorial and you have created a situation in which her cat feels very threatened.\n\n If you return the kitten, be aware because it is an \"owner surrender\" and doesn't need to be held for a stray hold; in some shelters, when every cage is full but other animals have stray holds, they will have to euthanize an animal like your kitten even if one of those on a stray hole to seems totally feral and unadoptable because it is the only one it is legal for them to euthanize.

I've done it multiple times and it has always started with the new cat confined to a single room at the start as you very gradually get the felines used to each other and increase the time they spend together.  A single room will feel like a huge space to kitten who has been living in a kennel at the shelter.   On the other hand, locking a adult cat that has had the run or the whole apartment away in a room will cause it stress and make the introduction even harder.   Apologize to your roommate.

I am hoping she\u2019ll be open to working this out", "\u201cWe HAD to! And we named her Banana Puddinggggg! Because we\u2019re cute too!\u201d \n\nGood lord, I can just hear the whining.", "Thank you. I do understand everyone\u2019s outrage but I am hoping I can make things right for my roommate and both kitties", "Be prepared for this to not work though. Older cats especially can be very set in their ways, and there's already been negative interactions between the old cat and Pudding. You also need to consider that the older cat has an entire history you don't know about... people generally have a reason for saying their cat has to be a solo cat. You'll want to look into friends or family members who might be able to house Pudding for a while and will let you visit frequently.\n\nETA: Also consider what the other poster said about returning her to the shelter. It's more important that she have a good life than for her to be with y'all if you can't work things out properly.", "If you\u2019ve never had a pet, you shouldn\u2019t adopt a kitten. Adopt (with your roommates permission) an older cat at first. Learn the ropes.", "That's my thing. They took no time at all to get to know anything about cats, and then they got a cat? I really hope they return it, and I hope OP's partner is crying because of how much it hurts to be such an idiot and doesn't blame the roommate for this at all.", "Yeah you have to do a slow introduction. The last time I had to do this it took 8 MONTHS for my cat and my sister's cat to have a bit of an understanding. When I moved in with my partner, I had my three cats stay with my mom because my partner's cat has never had to share space with another and has a heart condition.", "I didn't even think of this, but you're right. Usually the shelter applications ask about other pets in the home to make sure everything will go well. It really feels like the two of them (OP and their partner) woke up and decided to use their one shared braincell to fly by the seats of their pants- and here we are! Everyone outside of OP's direct scope is just a casualty.", "They probably fibbed to get a kitten thinking their roommate would be totally hunky-dory with it.", "Having another cat and noting that on the application wouldn\u2019t preclude you from adopting a kitten.  (It\u2019s actually better for a kitten to not be an only pet.)  Most cats can accept a new kitten, especially if introduced properly and gradually, but since OP ignored everything they knew about the resident cat, they probably ignored any suggestions offered about introductions.", "I think OP just lied to the shelter to get what she wanted.", "You realize that the end result is the same as they suggested, right? OP moves out.", "I mean, the place i volunteer at not only would screen for other pets but also requires all adults in the household to be there to agree on the pet (in the sense of agreeing they are aware of the new pet and agree to be responsible for it, basically just meant as an acknowledgement that a new pet is coming to avoid this exact \"surprise\"). Not only would OP have had to lie about the other cat on our app (since they'd require a meet up before final adoption) but also would have to lie about there being a 3rd roommate besides just the couple", "The city animal control service is overwhelmed and has too many animals, but still properly vets potential owners because they don\u2019t want the pet coming back.", "100% agree. \n\nOur cats were assholes to eachother, but they never got to the point of actually hurting eachother.", "I would put money on OP lying to the shelter about other cats in the house. Not all do home visits these days as it's so resource intensive and instead rely on an interview and pictures of the living situation, so I reckon OP said they didn't have any other pets.", "My current kitty likes to be held like a baby, but only by me, my boyfriend and my mother in law. Otherwise she's hissing at anyone else trying to do so.\n\nAnd yes, most of the cats don't like it at all, period. You just don't pick a cat randomly and the 'calling it behavioural issues if they are pissed.", "I recently tried to adopt a cat for my cat, they asked her temperament and would only allow us a kitten if we had another cat for it to bond with. I highly doubt they were honest with the shelter", "It would have been entirely fair for your roommate to say no. You moved in with someone who said they had a solo cat.", "*wanting* a cat does not mean you automatically should have and deserve and are ready for a cat. clearly, you aren\u2019t.", "Of course it would be fair for her to say no!!! You are really not getting it. At all.", "What if she says the only solution is getting rid of your kitten? \n\nAlso, did you at least make sure your cat doesn\u2019t have feline leukemia or any other medical issues???", "That is exactly why you didn't talk to her first - you thought she'd say no, and you didn't want to hear no. That's an incredibly immature outlook and doesn't speak well of your readiness to be responsible for another life. \n\nYour roommate told you when they first moved in they could only live in a home with no other cats. You could have\n\nA. said no, that won't work for me, I want a kitten someday soon. \n\nB. said yes, and then committed to not getting a kitten as long as you live with this roommate. \n\nYou did neither. When you wanted to get a kitten, you could have talked with the roommate about it. Maybe after discussing how to introduce the cats to each other, maybe inviting her to the shelter with you to meet the potential new kitten, maybe talking with the shelter staff or your vet, you could have come up with a plan that everyone was on board with. Or maybe you would have realized you can't bring a kitten into this household, and you and your gf need to move out, or postpone getting a pet. \n\nYou wanted what you wanted, and you wanted it now. You didn't care how roommate felt, how the cat felt, how the new kitten would feel being thrown into a new home with an unwelcoming older cat, or even how you and your gf would really feel dealing with this situation. You wanted, you took. You lied (by omission - to your roommate, and I'm assuming to the shelter staff too - there's no way you said \"there's already a cat long-established in the home who has a history of hostility to other cats\"). You couldn't be bothered to take the time to introduce a new pet to a new home properly, to even do some basic research. And now, when laying in the bed you've entirely made yourself is uncomfortable, your proposed solution is to abandon your new family member back at the shelter. \n\nYou need to do some growing up - now. Both those cats and your roommate deserve a LOT more caring and respect than you've shown them so far. Time for you to give whatever time, effort or other sacrifice you need to either make the home safe and happy for both cats, or for you and your gf to find another home. Do NOT displace your roommate, do NOT reduce her cats quality of life to nothing being boxed in a single room, and do NOT abandon your new cat back at the shelter. If that means you have to move, with all the cost and inconvenience that entails, fine. \n\nGood luck, and be better.", "About 1 in every 10 cats just *does not like* other cats, and there is literally nothing that will change that. (In my experience they also get more aggressive toward other cats as they get older, but that's just my experience having had two different cats like this.) \n\nIf your roommate's cat is one of these cats, then even the best introduction in the world won't help. Your roommate's cat deserves to have a peaceful, pleasant life, and if she does not like other cats, your kitten will need to live elsewhere. \n\nAlso, I'm curious, having worked with shelters and having adopted many cats myself : Most shelters ask about other pets in the house, and the shelters I've worked with would never have approved this placement, for exactly the reasons you're now experiencing. Did you indicate on the application that there was another cat in the house?", "You're still stressing out an elderly cat for no reason other than selfishness. And you haven't even considered what happens when your kitten bonds to the older cat and the older cat either moves out or dies. All you care about is what you want. That's why you're getting piled on. All the people here with cat experience are telling you to take the kitten back to the shelter because that's what is in its best interest but you're cherry picking the advice that lets you do what you want, which is keep the kitten.", "Thank you for the suggestion! I do have family who would be willing to house Pudding if it ends up not working out while we figure out a different living situation. My roommate is willing to talk so I\u2019m hoping we can at least try to make this work! We\u2019re gonna have a convo once she\u2019s home from work", "Everything you described here demonstrates you are a considerate and overall thoughtful person. A complete foil to OP.", "A lot of rescues require home visits and would definitely not adopt if there was a cat that didn't like other cats.\n\nThey lied to the shelter.", "I don\u2019t think they care what their roommate would feel about it", "Ours doesn't even ask those questions tho. It should, and OP is the AH, but it's possible it didn't even come up with the shelter", "I\u2019m going to do my best to learn from this and become a better owner. My roommate said she\u2019s willing to talk so I\u2019m going to see if she\u2019s willing to help with a proper introduction for the kitties and help me understand cat behavior a little more. I have already been looking into some of the resources provided in the comments and I can see I was definitely not educated on cat behavior and care. I want to give our kitty the best life possible!", "Yes our kitten is healthy with no transmittable issues and he is also fully vaccinated, neutered, etc.\n\nShe is willing to talk after work so I\u2019m hoping we can figure something out that works for both of us. If not, I suppose it will be on me and my gf to find a new living arrangement either for ourselves or the kitten", "*\u201cMy roommate said she\u2019s willing to talk so I\u2019m going to see if she\u2019s willing to help with a proper introduction for the kitties and help me understand cat behavior a little more.\u201c*\n\nThis is not her responsibility. It\u2019s your responsibility to learn cat behavior on your own. The way it should\u2019ve been done well before the kitten was adopted. You\u2019ve already made terrible impositions on your roommate and your solution is to add more? If you want a successful conversation, take ownership on how you messed up and how you plan to fix it without any more burden on her. \n\nQuestion: How many litter boxes are in the house?", "Adopting a kitten should not be a spontaneous decision. You didn't even look up how to introduce cats before you unilaterally decided this, and now expect your roommate to pick up the fall out. YTA 100%. \n\nA kitten is a living being -- a baby cat and a life long commitment. Not an accessory. It seems like you know better now but you need to educate yourself to make sure you're doing right by your new kitten. Diet, vaccinations, potential diseases, etc etc. Don't make your kitten suffer for your inexperience."]}
