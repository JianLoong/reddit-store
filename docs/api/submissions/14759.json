My brother has Ashley(almost 18) from his first marriage and his wife has Chloe(18). I have not met either his wife or Chloe since I was not invited to the wedding. My parents weren't told about them till the wedding date was set so they are not at all close with them. \n\nI came to visit my parents and Ashley last week. One of the things Ashley is very big on is gaming. Her dream is to own a Nintendo Switch. So after saving for a while I finally was able to buy her a switch as a gift. I didn't know anything about Chloe but according to Ash she likes makeup so after getting her number things on the makeup, I got one of my female friends to buy some for her.\n\nSo last week I went to visit and gave Chloe and Ashley their gifts, and when Chloe saw Ash's gift she got upset that I got more gifts and something more expensive for Ash. However, my brother and Jen smoothed everything over with the promise of buying Chloe more gifts, in private they got mad at me for showing favoritism.\n\nWe had our Easter get-together yesterday and everyone was milling around and talking. Mostly everyone was ignoring my brother, Jen and Chloe but everyone was talking to Ash, Chloe looked like she was about to start crying and my brother and Jen started comforting her telling her \"how we are all so mean\", etc.\n\nEverything was fine until dinner. Ash was talking about colleges (she's hoping to get a fashion degree) and told me how she's hoping to get into the ones she applied for abroad. My brother chimes in and says she can't go abroad because he doesn't have any money saved for her, so looks like she can't go abroad. Ash's mom Ruby pipes in and says she's got money saved up for Ash, and I pipe up and say I have too and that if Ash gets into one in the state where I live in she can stay with me or if she gets in on in another state or this certain country I have a few female friends who would be happy to take her in so she doesn't have to be alone in a foreign country.\n\nMy brother goes \"What abut Chloe?\" and I say \"I don't even know her properly, you can't expect me to do everything for her\" and then Chloe starts throwing a tantrum and started saying a very ridiculous fantasy story (and just by hearing it you could see everyone was offended and angry so I told her calmly before someone exploded that \"You can't expect to be treated like Ash so soon, we have known her her whole life we haven't even properly know you yet, right now you're a stranger to us, give us time to get to know you properly, and soon we'll love you as much as Ash.\" My brother stands up and yells at us on how we could be this cruel to a kid.\n\nI feel a bit guilty now and feel like I should have been much more nicer.

Your brother, partner and Chloe are acting extremely entitled and rude. You bought Chloe a gift and made it personal to her, which was very kind of you. You didn't need to do that, especially seeing as you don't know her well. \n\nIt sounds like your brother is overcompensating with Chloe, which in turn is bringing Ashley down. Their remarks are uncalled for and just bizarre. \n\n\nI'm so glad Ashley has the support from yourself and her Mum.", "NTA\n\nFor all the reasons others have given. Also, what 18yo does this? \n\n>Chloe starts throwing a tantrum and started saying a very ridiculous fantasy story\n\nI have 19yo & 20yo girls; both stopped having tantrums as toddlers, not at 18.\n\nYou simply know one more than the other. If everyone can't see that and labels your generous actions as \"favouritism\" they're being silly.", "NTA. We are talking about an 18 year old right?! Chloe is not a poor child abandoned by her family, she is apparently a very spoiled and immature grown-up (I could settle for young adult, but not child). How on earth could Chloe feel so entitled to your money, gifts and affection? How was she raised to throw a temper tantrum im front of new family? This won't be going in the direction you suggested (give family time to get to know her and soon she will be as loved as Ash). With a behavior like that all the family bonding most likely will never happen and it will because of Chloe and her mom (who raised her to be like that).", "NTA. I have money set aside for my niblings but not for their step siblings. The step siblings know this and are cool. I buy them easter eggs, Xmas gifts and birthday stuff. But they know their role in my life and vice versa. \nChloe sounds like a spoilt brat and I'd stop giving her anything at all until she can learn to be gracious.", "NTA\n\nThat little speech at the end seemed fair to me. I mean you told the truth. I just would\u2019ve not said that in front of everybody, or at least Chloe. \n\nPulling your brother/Jen aside and then telling them what you said so they understand that you\u2019re not playing favourites would\u2019ve probably been better. That way they could\u2019ve decided how to handle explaining that to Chloe themselves.\n\nBut at the day you can\u2019t fake emotions so as long as you\u2019re not purposefully trying to be mean to Chloe then I think what you did is justified.", "NTA.\n\nStrange how your brother kept them a secret up until he couldn't. And he now expects you to ignore that and welcome them with open arms and wallets. The fact that you don't have any established relationship with them is his fault, and he needs to accept that. And the new niece sounds like a spoiled brat. 18 and throwing tantrums like she's 3.", "The step has her own family to buy her stuff", "NTA\n\n>since I was not invited to the wedding.\n\nOut of curiosity, why weren't you invited?", "If I understand correctly, you had never met Chloe before, you bought her a gift, but she was annoyed it wasn't as good as the one for your relative you have known for 18 years. The second time you meet her she wants you to pay towards her degree.   \nYou probably shouldn't have 'expoded' at her in front of the whole family, but you certainly aren't the AH here.", "NTA", "NTA They cornered you all day into a position where you had to bring their asses back to reality. I hope Chloe\u2019s aunts and uncles and grandparents are falling over backwards to care for Ashley the same way they expect you guys to care for Chloe. This is beyond ridiculous.", "This reminds me of that story where a parent was told that they were giving preferential treatment to his child. He had adopted the child at a young age because his parents had died. It was biologically his nibling but he was essentially his child and he raised him. Then his other siblings told him that he was giving preferential treatment to his child and didn\u2019t do the same for his other niblings. \nLike its not the same thing whatsoever and th e stepdaughter is being greedy. \nNta", "Info: what was the \"ridiculous fantasy story\"?", "This story is so ridiculous that I'm calling troll.", "Yeah the obligatory capitalistic easter gift...", "YTA (softly) \n\nChloe is already having a hard time adjusting to the new family and her emotions are likely all over the place. She's being irrational by expecting you to treat her exactly like ash, but you could be nicer and more understanding too.", "Your title is off btw. \n\nYTA.\n\nThe big reason is the whole gift thing. In most circumstances giving gifts of different values to two people at the same time is a shitty thing to do. If they open the gifts at the same time it's going to be obvious which one is more expensive and is going to cause an issue. At the very least you could have given gifts of the same value in public and given the switch privately. I don't see how any adult could have not foreseen that being an issue.\n\nThe college thing is incredibly different though. It does not make sense for you to save up money for a step-niece when they have been married for a year and it doesn't make sense for you to invite a complete stranger to live with you. However, this conversation should have happened in private but honestly an 18 year old should be able to understand this situation. your brother jumping to her defense doesn't help the situation either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They do their birthday parties together. Despite not knowing the cousin (as he's not technically my family) I still get them gifts of similar value simply because it would be rude not to. If I wanted to get my nephew something more expensive I would do so in private where the other child would not feel bad about receiving a (comparably) worse gift. \n\nSure we can argue that they're both 18 and she shouldn't even expect a gift from her step-uncle she never met but a little bit of consideration goes a long way.", "Okay..... Just wondered", ">Despite not knowing the cousin (as he's not technically my family) I still get them gifts of similar value simply because it would be rude not to.\n\nEither your nephew is missing out or your in-laws are scamming you because there's no expectation that you get them equivalent gifts. \n\nI've been to joint birthday parties before where I only knew one child, and there was no issue with giving the other kid a less expensive gift. I'd say that a good proportion of attendees at such parties I've been to were doing that, on both sides."]}
