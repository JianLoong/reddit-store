Ash was talking about colleges (she's hoping to get a fashion degree) and told me how she's hoping to get into the ones she applied for abroad.

How on earth could Chloe feel so entitled to your money, gifts and affection? How was she raised to throw a temper tantrum im front of new family? This won't be going in the direction you suggested (give family time to get to know her and soon she will be as loved as Ash). With a behavior like that all the family bonding most likely will never happen and it will because of Chloe and her mom (who raised her to be like that).", "NTA.

In most circumstances giving gifts of different values to two people at the same time is a shitty thing to do. If they open the gifts at the same time it's going to be obvious which one is more expensive and is going to cause an issue. At the very least you could have given gifts of the same value in public and given the switch privately. I don't see how any adult could have not foreseen that being an issue.\n\nThe college thing is incredibly different though. It does not make sense for you to save up money for a step-niece when they have been married for a year and it doesn't make sense for you to invite a complete stranger to live with you.
