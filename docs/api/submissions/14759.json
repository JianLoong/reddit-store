This won't be going in the direction you suggested (give family time to get to know her and soon she will be as loved as Ash).

In most circumstances giving gifts of different values to two people at the same time is a shitty thing to do. If they open the gifts at the same time it's going to be obvious which one is more expensive and is going to cause an issue. At the very least you could have given gifts of the same value in public and given the switch privately.

So it's not even close to realistic that you would 1) have resources saved up for her.  Were you supposed to take out a loan to fund this savings for her to MATCH Ashley's???? 2) have feelings for someone you've never met.\n\nPLUS having met her only as an adult--who you will likely rarely see--it isn't likely you will come to love her equally to Ashley.(is she really 18? she's seems about 5 on level of maturity).\n\nThe way you describe her, I know I would not be extending myself to get to know her better.  Don't care to pander to brats. \n\nI think you should have a chat with Ashley and see how she feels, I'm getting the feeling that she's may be getting the shaft as her Dad and Stepmother are making EVERYTHING about Chloe.  \n\n(curious about this fantasy story......)", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12loibr/aita_for_telling_my_niece_she_should_expect/jg860la/", "[removed]", "She needs to see a fucking psychiatrist, like yesterday. She sounds completely delusional.", "Lol wow First Annual Easter SmackDown.....I really like how you all have your niece's back!", "I work in a childrens hospital, and I\u2019ve also seen a lot of kids who have developmental and mental health conditions, and it is horrifying to see how many parents will refuse to get their kids properly screened or deny the diagnosis outright. It means that their kids don\u2019t get the help they need, and they end up doing something or developing psychosomatic problems that literally put them in the hospital. This is especially common with adolescents, because that\u2019s around the time when subclinical issues tend to worsen if not properly addressed. \n\nGiven the issues that her mother seems to have, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she got her \u201cchecked out\u201d and then denied the diagnosis.", "The girls are both about 18 and it's unreasonable to expect your brother and his wife Chloe to treat them like family members for life.", "THIS. Sounds like Ash is set for college and since she will be an adult the brother and his wife can't stop her from going to 7/11, much less the university of her choice.", "Bad bot!", "Fourth actually", "\ud83d\ude02 I love it."]}
