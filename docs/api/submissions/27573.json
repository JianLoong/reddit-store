Their diets should be low to no carbohydrate. \n\nCats are also descended from desert dwelling ancestors and get most of their hydration from their food. They do not have much of a thirst drive.  Dry cat foods rely on grain products and provide poor nutrition. \n\nA cat's diet should consist of wet canned food or a properly prepared raw diet. Cats fed only dry food are chronically dehydrated. Dry food causes diabetes, kidney failure, and obesity. The idea that wet food contributes to dental disease is a myth. \n\nYou have no idea what you are talking\nabout and should not be offering advice on how to feed cats. Period \n\nVets are not properly instructed in appropriate diets for cats and get kickbacks from companies to push dry food. \n\nRead this for more information.  \n\nhttps://catinfo.org/", "thank you so much for writing this and sparing me. dry food is poison for cats. period. and every sentence of the comment you replied to is factually wrong", "Keeping up on dental health for cats is VERY IMPORTANT though.

There is dry food on the market that has a lot of protein. It is expensive though. The problem is mostly that people feed their cats cheap dry food from the grocery store. Which has a lot grains. And other fillers that are not animal-protein.\n\nMy cat is fussy about wet food. He eats it, but he would rather eat kibble. About the only wet food he likes is gourmet chicken mousse. I would like to give him something better but he won't touch anything else. Doesn't like raw feeding either. He likes kibble much, much, much more. He doesn't eat fish either. So, I really need to read the labels properly, because if there is like 1 or 2% anything fish in his food he will not touch it.\n\nI buy him Purizon kibble, (beef/wild boar/chicken) which is a brand that is high animal protein and still reasonably priced, but absolutely more expensive than Felix or Whiskas or Friskies or whatever cheap grocery store brand. Which are absolutely shit. Most cheap wet-food is better than cheap kibble any time. \n\nThe good thing about the expensive food is that you need to feed them less of it though. My cat is a large, 6 kilo, house panter, inside cat only, but he is happy with just 1 can of gourmet and about 30 grams of kibble a day. Keeps him active and on a perfect weight. \n\nAnyway, yes, my point is: you can get high protein kibble, but you have to order it online and it is more expensive and you have to do some research on the ingredients. Load of brands will say things like: 'no grains'. Then if you look at the protein content you see that it is from peas and beets. So, sure no grain, but still shit.\n\nLuckily my cat does drink plenty of water. \n\nOf course, there are always people who will say 'yeah, but my cat got to 22 only eating Friskies'. Sure, my grandma got to 98 smoking half a pack of cigs a day and only drinking Sherry, but well, can't say she really was that healthy.

Gets a can a day. But he would rather have kibble. He's a fussy half Siamese asshole. He eats his kibble immediately, then with a face of 'oh, this is there too' he will eat the wet food.

My neighbor had to switch to wet food because no matter how much water was available and how it was presented the cat would not drink enough water to stay properly hydrated with water alone.", "As I understand it, cats get most of their water from prey animals that they eat, and if you have water set out that doesn't move they will be hesitant to drink from that as well. So if you have cats that don't go outside, it's easier for them to get dehydrated. My wife and I have 4 cats, all of them were feral at one point and they all go outside and hunt. I very rarely see them drink from the water bowls inside the house.", "Cats can be picky about water. For example, they don\u2019t like their water right next to their food. Maybe she wasn't aware of some cat behaviors. \n\n(Mine has food, box, and 3 water sources all seperate, and one is a fountain)", "We used to have a cat that demanded fresh cold water if he deemed his \"too warm\". The happy dance he did when he saw you coming with a fresh bowl of water was so cute that it was worth his demands (sometimes 3 or 4 times a day).\n\nWe also had one that would scream till you turned the sink on for him to drink from and another that prefers to drink from the bathtub. We've always had male cats and they're especially prone to crystals and such so they get water in whatever form they want, whenever they want.", "They are so funny like that.  If you can see the bottom of her food bowl she thinks it's empty and cries until I refill.   I have been so sick with a horrible cough/cold, (thank god not covid), and she hasn't left my side.  She wants to  curl next to me and give me head nods over and over trying to make me feel better.", "That cat trained you right!  It is the same at our house.  We don\u2019t train them, they train us", "Vets do not get kick backs from food companies.", "Clean bowl full of water? \ud83d\ude1e\u270b\n\n\nManky puddle? \ud83d\ude0c\u261d\ufe0f", "Keeping the water bowl by the food bowl is really common and not something that cats like. It does actually discourage them from drinking as much as they might otherwise.", "It's mostly weird that it happened to both of them at the same time. I have one cat with kidney disease that hates wet food and doesn't drink enough from the water fountain, so I have to regularly give her fluids. It's weird to see two cats get dehydrated at the same time if it's not neglect.", "I have one of those lil two layer fountains for my cat to drink from, and he seems to like it a lot now and uses it, but I have to keep a regular bowl of water right next to it. Sometimes he decides he doesn\u2019t like running water today, and cries at the empty bowl. He needs \u2728options\u2728", "my neighbor has a cat fountain (multiple, actually) and she still had to switch to wet food because Dwight will not drink enough water to remain properly hydrated unless his food is providing a lot of the hydration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, that cat is an (adorable) idiot. But there's no way he's the only one like that.", "Ours hated the fountain - I thought it'd be a great addition, we made it its own little spot.. And then it just got ignored. We moved it twice, no change.\n\nThat said, we've got a water bowl next to their food as well - for us it's a popular spot, that water disappears quickly. Didn't know that some cats don't like that, but preferences are okay, that's why there's options, right?", "Well something is going on.", "The puddle has \u2728\ufe0fflavors\u2728\ufe0f", "Some cats definitely need it in their food.", "My point is more that there's no indication Op's sister was being neglectful. My neighbor had to take her cat to the vet for dehydration before making the switch. And tbh to hear her tell it the vet recommended wet food immediately and wasn't even surprised.  She dotes on that cat and loves him immensely. \n\nI'm just saying just because the sister's cats were dehydrated doesn't mean they didn't have access to water.", "Yeah, my cat won't eat most wet food at all - not a quality-dependent thing, she's just really fussy. She'll eat fish but we've tried feeding her chicken and she doesn't like it at all (will try the tiniest bit then ignore it, raw or cooked plain chicken), won't touch beef, and we also can't swap dry food brands as she'll either ignore the food, or she'll get sick. I suspect my cat is just the cat equivalent of a person who always orders the same thing when they go out to eat.", "You're reading a lot into my comment. And OP literally said she \"wasn't giving them enough water\" a few comments up from mine - water fountains hold more water than bowls and stay fresher, thus my comment."]}
