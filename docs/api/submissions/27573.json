Because it's perfectly fine and healthy to decide to get plastic surgery if you can afford it and feel like it would make *you* happy; but if you can't afford it and still want it anyways, and if you attribute negative things (like breakups and rejections) to specific aspects of your body that are almost certainly not related to those aspects of your body, that smacks of BDD.\n\nIf she has BDD, she will almost certainly NEVER be satisfied with her nose no matter how much surgery she gets, because BDD has no \"endpoint.\" Behind each surgery is only more distress and heartache, and yearning for another. Healing the psychology behind it is the only way to end it.\n\n(Incidentally, to head off any transphobic whataboutism, this mechanism is exactly why treating gender *dysphoria* with surgery is successful, and treating body *dysmorphia* with surgery is not. Gender affirmation surgery leads to *positive* psychological outcomes and is, interestingly, one of the least-regretted surgeries available to humankind, if not THE least-regretted surgery. It produces feelings of gender euphoria, and has an endpoint. Surgery in a context of body dysmorphia, on the other hand, leads to *negative* psychological outcomes and is ultimately damaging because it does not heal the underlying distress and has no endpoint.)", "Is water a rare commodity where you live?", "NTA.

There should always be a full water bowl out for cats they can drink from any time, which it sounds like she knows now, but hard food helps to remove plaque buildup.

Even though she still has to check dental health regularly with dry food, with wet food she\u2019s going to have to do it more often and more than likely she should be brushing their teeth using cat safe toothpaste and tooth brushes. \n\nEven a mixture of wet and dry food is better for cats than full on wet food.

Yeah, but an overall healthy cat (no chronic issues) shouldn\u2019t.", "Yes", "I don't think I've read an answer on here that has as much misinformation as this one . Everything you wrote is absolutely,  completely wrong. \n\nCats are obligate carnivores, meaning their bodies are designed to only process protein. They are not omnivores and do not require grains or carbohydrates.  Their diets should be low to no carbohydrate. \n\nCats are also descended from desert dwelling ancestors and get most of their hydration from their food. They do not have much of a thirst drive.  Dry cat foods rely on grain products and provide poor nutrition. \n\nA cat's diet should consist of wet canned food or a properly prepared raw diet. Cats fed only dry food are chronically dehydrated. Dry food causes diabetes, kidney failure, and obesity. The idea that wet food contributes to dental disease is a myth. \n\nYou have no idea what you are talking\nabout and should not be offering advice on how to feed cats. Period \n\nVets are not properly instructed in appropriate diets for cats and get kickbacks from companies to push dry food. \n\nRead this for more information.  \n\nhttps://catinfo.org/", "thank you so much for writing this and sparing me. dry food is poison for cats. period. and every sentence of the comment you replied to is factually wrong", "Keeping up on dental health for cats is VERY IMPORTANT though. They're right about that.  \nOne of mine had to have all her teeth removed when I was a kid. She went from a grumpy recluse to a kitten again, I can't begin to imagine what she'd been living with before that. I still feel bad about that.  \nSo, definitely check in on that and try to get kittens used to their mouths being checked and cleaned. They may not love the process but it's better than the alternative.", "yes that\u2019s true but the way to do that is not dry food like that commenter said. that\u2019s a total myth. but yes dental health is absolutely important. if you can brush their teeth or even rub them with a wash cloth every day or every few days that will be a huge help. and keep up with dental cleanings at the vet.", "NTA.

Son works at a pet store. Every day someone will come in saying their vet suggested some specific brand for their pet. Son gets more info and explains that's the 30th time this month bc vet has some dealings with the food Co. He is not a vet but very educated when it comes to animal diets (and human, food in general). It's clearly a kickback when so many people come in from the same vet asking for the same product for all sorts of issues. Doesn't work like that.", "Agreed - another wet and raw feeder here.", "It is true that cats get a lot of their water intake from wet food. But there is dry food on the market that has a lot of protein. It is expensive though. The problem is mostly that people feed their cats cheap dry food from the grocery store. Which has a lot grains. And other fillers that are not animal-protein.\n\nMy cat is fussy about wet food. He eats it, but he would rather eat kibble. About the only wet food he likes is gourmet chicken mousse. I wouldd like to give him something better but he won't touch anything else. Doesn't like raw feeding either. He likes kibble much, much, much more. He doesn't eat fish either. So, I really need to read the labels properly, because if there is like 1 or 2% anything fish in his food he will not touch it.\n\nI buy him Purizon kibble, (beef/wild boar/chicken) which is a brand that is still reasonably priced, but absolutely more expensive than Felix or Whiskas or Friskies or whatever cheap grocery store brand. Which are absolutely shit. Most cheap wet-food is better than cheap kibble any time. \n\nThe good thing about the expensive food is that you need to feed them less of it though. My cat is a large, 6 kilo, house panter, inside cat only, but he is happy with just 1 can of gourmet and about 30 grams of kibble a day. Keeps him active and on a perfect weight. \n\nAnyway, yes, my point is: you can get high protein kibble, but you have to order it online and it is more expensive and you have to do some research on the ingredients. Load of brands will say things like: 'no grains'. Then if you look at the protein content you see that it is from peas and beets. So, sure no grain, but still shit.\n\nLuckily my cat does drink plenty of water. \n\nOf course, there are always people who will say 'yeah, but my cat got to 22 only eating Friskies'. Sure, my grandma got to 98 smoking half a pack of cigs a day and only drinking Sherry, but well, can't say she really was that healthy. Think she got that old on spite.", "While I'm a big advocate of taking care of cats' teeth, some are basically fucked genetically, and will need their teeth out at some point regardless of the care their owner has taken. Their own plaque causes painful inflammation.", "if you read the information on the link the other commenter provided catinfo.org you will see the studies that prove that cats who eat dry food cannot make up for the water they are missing and still remain chronically dehydrated to a statistically significant degree. this is even more dangerous for male cats. the moisture is the most pressing issue. the vet who wrote that page says the worst quality wet food is still better than the \u201cbest quality\u201d dry food and that\u2019s the truth. your cat drinks plenty of water *because* he is dehydrated. he is not making up for the water he is lacking. \u201cA cat consuming a predominantly dry food diet does drink more water than a cat consuming a canned food diet, but in the end, when water from all sources is added together (what\u2019s in their diet plus what they drink), the cat on dry food consumes approximately half the amount of water compared with a cat eating canned food.\u201d you can do whatever you want with your cat but these are facts.", "That's why I do give him wet food too. Gets a can a day. But he would rather have kibble. He's a fussy half Siamese asshole. He eats his kibble immediately, then with a face of 'oh, this is there too' he will eat the wet food. I tried everything, even tried a whole bunch of raw. He won't touch it. Sometimes cats are just going to cat.\n\nBut read what I wrote. My point was: grocery store kibble is always shit, if you do feed mostly kibble get better kibble."]}
