I am the youngest of 3 siblings, i was born considerably later than my siblings. When i was born my older sister was 9 and my older brother was 20 while my dad was already retired. Due to that i spent a LOT of time with my father growing up.\n\nI don't remember exactly how old i was at the time but one day he took out some VHS tapes and a VHS player and asked me to choose a movie. I dug around a bit until i found the Karate Kid tape, it immediately caught my eye. Although i was still a toddler i was fascinated by the movie and watching it alongside my father was very special to me. After that we watched Karate Kid 2 and 3 and it became sort of our thing to watch Karate Kid together.\n\nThis is getting long so i'll skip the details but keep in mind these tapes are very important to me.\n\nAbout 10 years ago my father died and i kept the tapes since they were so important to me.\n\nToday my siblings came by to visit and we reminisced about when our father was alive and i mentioned still having the tapes in usable conditions. Then the conversation changed.\n\nThey tried to convince me to sell the tapes because, according to them, these tapes are worth at least a thousand each but i think they were lying. I refused to sell and they tried to coerce ke, saying the tapes were \"part of the inheritance\" and that they deserve their share too.\n\nOur argument got heated and they ended up calling me an \"entitled man-child\" for getting attached to \"obsolete\" things.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667665557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymyq37/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_late_fathers_karate/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep them and remember your dad fondly. And if they still won't relent, SWEEP THE LEG!", "NTA.  Sentimental value is whatever you feel.  You can attach sentimental value to anything \u2014 a piece of gravel, a record you have worn out, old shoes, valuable jewelry.\n\nIf this was an original, new in box, first print, way more than $1k.  But if it was not first print, sealed, maybe $50.  And well used is probably $10.  My evil suggestion:  buy a used one on eBay.  Give it to them, ask them to sell it, and wait for them to try and explain how they didn\u2019t get much for them!", "INFO: google says they\u2019re worth ~$5, any idea why your siblings thought that?", "I collected video games my whole life. A lot of my old games didn't age well, so I can't really replay all of them for fun. When I got a space and finally set up a shelf for my games, my partner said that it's stupid to hoard small local copies of obsolete software that I rarely use. \"You can just download a lot of these now. Look, this one and this one and this one are all available. You can sell this stuff.\" We had such an argument.\n\nIt means nothing to him, but to me it was my childhood. I know they have value, but the value they have to me is different. Possessions have meaning. Otherwise, what's an heirloom ring but a bit of metal and a rock? NTA", "I'd imagine they are worth pennies.", "Sealed, unused copies certainly do seem to list for a bit - [here's the first one for $2,499](https://www.ebay.com/itm/334537725771), [here's a sealed collector's edition of the first three for $1,499](https://www.ebay.com/itm/125588337221). Honestly, I think people are somehow trying to manipulate the market - if you look on ebay for 'karate kid vhs', pick only SOLD listings - every time the value is over $20 or so, it's a thousands-ish dollars listing, which had a 'best offer accepted'.\n\nAnd all that said, your copies aren't pristine, unused ones. They're well-loved, well-watched ones.

I'm sorry if you find that upsetting. That concludes this discussion.'", "NTA\n\n\nThose tapes, even if they are worth that much, are far more valuable than any monetary amount. They're special because of the bond you had with your father and your love for the movie and watching it with him, and no amount of money can replace that. Also, idk about your \"inheritance\" situation, but since you have the tapes, I assume they were either left to you or there was no inheritance thing and you claimed the tapes to remember your dad by. Either way, your siblings obviously care more about getting some quick money than what the tapes represent. \n\n\nStand your ground OP, and my condolences for your loss.", "NTA \n\nI think that your siblings were just looking at things from a  purely money perspective and without any empathy for the sentimental value those tapes have.", "Thousands of dollars for used Karate Kid VHS? Your brother and sister are quite confused. \nINFO: Is there something special about those tapes? Special edition maybe?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Karate Kid tapes can be sold for quite some money if sealed, which I don\u2019t think this is the case.\n\nNTA. For you those tapes are invaluable and a way to honor your father. Fight for them. \nGet them appraised. I sense it will be 50USD tops. Then pay your siblings \u201ctheir part\u201d so they stop bothering you.", "NTA. These tapes are absolutely worth more to you in nostalgia/memories than they would be if you sold them. Also, your siblings are delusional. I think I still have those VHS tapes in a closet bedroom in my mom's house, and you could maybe get $20 for each on ebay. It would be more work for me to sell them--and I don't have emotional attachment to them. Is that worth letting go of something of your father's that you love? I don't think so.", "NTA. Also just because there\u2019s something worth that much, doesn\u2019t mean someone is going to be buying it lol. With inflation, I doubt anyone is going to be looking for a $1000 video tape. \n\nNot sure on if it is actually that value\u2026. But still.", "NTA! Your siblings are looking at something that holds extreme sentimental value to you with nothing more than a money-hungry lens. You have the right to hold onto those tapes and do with them what you want to.", "NTA. it doesn't matter if they're special to you, for what sentimental or sappy reason, whatever. they're yours, you don't have any reason to sell them. end of story.", "NTA. Those are your tapes. Just because they work doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re what you use when you watch the movies right? Because if they break or the machine eats them they\u2019re irreplaceable - because THOSE tapes belonged to your Dad. \n\nSounds like the fight I will have to have over the farm when my parents die. I already know the name going on the deed as per their will", "NTA. Your siblings are delusional, greedy AHs. Enjoy your memories and end the discussion with those twits.", "NTA:\nIf they are worth \"so much\" they can also be worth just as much too you.\n\nIf they really insist: buy you brothers out for 50$ each(you only need to pay them their shares, it's already partially yours)", "NTA, OP. Those VHS tapes mean a lot to you and are keeping your dearly departed father's memory alive. I think that your siblings are fixated on the money aspect. Hold on to those VHS tapes and keep saying no. My heart goes out to you about the loss of your loved one.", "NTA but FYI tapes only last so long before they degrade, so you can keep them for sentimental value, for usable value.. its declining rapidly at this point", "NTA. The VHS tapes are sentimental, and not worth what your siblings think. Even if they were, it's still sentimental.", "NTA, It's f*cking vhs tapes, unless they're SIGNED they're worth a buck or two. I think your siblings just want to hurt you bc it's special to you and your father, something they didn't get to do.", "NTA. I have one of the original The Little Mermaid VHS tapes with the penis on the cover and I the going rate for that is only $50 on eBay, your siblings are delusional there is no way those tapes are worth thousands. Actually I checked and an *unopened* Karate Kid VHS is being sold for $200 on there. So there ya go. Keep the tapes.", "NTA but I don't get it. Even if they were worth millions you don't want to sell and they belong to you so I don't see why they get a say. Plus VHS tapes are pretty darn small so they're hardly exactly ugly, clutter or in the way. BTW great taste in films.", "NTA, your siblings are being greedy. They are of sentimental value and you are keeping them. They are yours.", "NTA And give them an special place in your bookshelf. The emotional price they has is bigger than the $50 you can make selling them.", "NTA. No matter how much they might be (not very much if they\u2019re well used) in monetary value, this is a piece of your father who passed and whether or not is \u201dobsolete\u201d as a physical item you can use doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is that it\u2019s your piece of a person who was very important to you.\nMy father passed a few years ago, very suddenly and he never even hit pension age. I have his old LP player, I have nowhere to put it and I think it might cost more to fix it than to buy a new one, but I can\u2019t bring myself to throw it out. So you keep your \u201dobsolete\u201d VHS tapes and tell your siblings to honour your father in whatever way they want to and you\u2019ll honour him the way you want to.", "NTA you'll have to pry my original vhs of the little mermaid from my cold dead hands and that thing might actually be worth something. \n\nOn a more serious note- Don't let them bully you into parting ways with it. The vhs means more to you than it ever could to anyone else and that's the important thing to remember.", "NTA- since the tapes are so cheap buy them each a copy of the vhs tapes and tell them they can sell those ones instead.\n\nIf they want to be that petty it's fair game.", "NTA- offer to sell them to your siblings for $200 each.   Then tell them to screw off.", "NTA and there's no way they're worth $1000", "The tapes aren't worth anything but that is how hoarding starts. You are applying way too much emotional value to wrong thing.
