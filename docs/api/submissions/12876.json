She should have known better.", "NTA\n\nShe needed a reminder that capsaicin is nothing to mess with. For those who don't know, it is the chemical that makes hot peppers hot. She's lucky that she didn't get blisters from that stuff!", "NTA. It was a fair question and if her mistake was supposed to be a highly guarded secret they should've at least let you know. \n\nI understand her embarrassment at her boyfriends teasing and I can see why she would want to lash out but that doesn't make it appropriate for her or the rest of your family to grill you about it. I'm sure the girl can handle a little teasing.\n\nThey ALL need to remember that you're doing them a *kindness* by hosting them and they aren't doing themselves any favors by making this a bigger issue than it needs to be.

Can\u2019t keep stories like that to yourself.", "NAH - just the inevitable friction that comes with human relationships.\n\nIt makes sense that you are annoyed with her mistake. \n\nIt's understandable that she wants to move on after multiple years and doesn't see that mistake as relevant today. Nobody should be judged for one thing they did years ago. \n\nIt sounds like you expressed legitimate annoyance, she expressed legitimate embarassment, and she is less likely to make the mistake again. YWBTA if you harp on it if they come, but as is NAH.", "NTA  \nyou aren't wrong for being reluctant and it's not your fault the two of them share a fb account.", "NTA-you were direct and honest.
