It's not like actual temperature burns. Capsaicin affects the heat sensing nerves and causes them to be much more sensitive, to the point where just your body heat makes you feel like you're on fire.\n\nIn very high concentrations, it can be toxic if ingested. At lower concentrations it's really only dangerous as an inhalation hazard. But skin exposure is just painful, not actually harmful. Plus it's easily washed off skin with oil, soap, or an acidic compound like vinegar or lemon juice.\n\nI still don't recommend applying bear spray to yourself, but as long as she didn't get it in her lungs, she's almost certainly fine.\n\nIf you ever eat food that's way too spicy, eat ice cream. The cold temperature immediately helps the pain, the fats and casein proteins will bind to the capsaicin stopping the burn from getting worse.
