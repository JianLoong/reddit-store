I had (I went no contact years ago) some EXTREMELY entitled family members. they would touch, \"borrow\" (it's only borrowing if it actually gets returned....), damage, etc....and I would just be expected to grin and bear it. \n\nwhen I was younger and in a career that had me having some extremely dangerous items in my home, I had to literally put them under lock and key. sometimes I think it might've just been easier to visit a funeral than lock it all up. but, hindsight.....\n\nthe saying goes...you can choose your friends, but not your relatives.", "Kind of not an asshole, but also yes.\n\nYou lived out a real-life sitcom moment.

Do you think you can punish her more than the bear spray did?\n\nI thought maybe she stole something or broke your tools.

The bear spray problem was karma but not the big issue.  \n\nShe also could have partly redeemed herself by cleaning up the mess she made or paying to have it done.\n\nBasically, your lack of enthusiasm about her visiting again is because she is a loose cannon, has poor judgement, is entitled to disregard your possessions and privacy, etc.  So the question arises when she invites herself to your home, has she done anything to  make up for what she did?
