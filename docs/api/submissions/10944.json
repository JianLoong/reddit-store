{"id": 10944, "submission_id": "11c5ty5", "title": "AITA for hiding things from my step sister to prevent her from using them?", "selftext": "I [18F] have known my step-sister [16F], Liz, for 12 years, since our parents started dating. \n\nLiz has two other siblings, both a little older than me. They all grew up in a big expensive house, with a nice car, new toys and extravagant parties. My step-mom, Anne, always made sure that her daughters had nice skincare products, fancy new clothes, and good hair products. My dad worked hard but we could really only afford the essentials. My dad and Anne only got married in 2019, and in 2020 we all moved in together. My two older step siblings don't live at home anymore so it's just the four of us. \n\nWhen we were younger, Liz always made sure that I knew she had more than I did. And when I would ask to borrow or share things, she would basically swat me away. Honestly, it was kind of humiliating. I'd also like to point out that Anne is *extremely* nice. To the point where she refuses to even discipline her kids. She never has, and now they just walk all over her and insult her at any chance they get. My heart breaks for her, but I'm not sure what I can do except give her the respect she deserves. The point is, Liz is just all around kind of entitled and not enjoyable to be around. \n\nWell, since we moved into our new house (in a new town), I got myself a job. I work really hard and I make $17/hour, which is really great for someone who's still in highschool (at least where I live). I'm putting most of my money away for college but over recently discovered that I can actually spend it on things for myself. So, I have. Nothing extravagant, but I bought myself a decent skincare routine, some hair elastics from Lululemon (which were kinda just a splurge, but idc because I love how they feel on my hair so much), and a hair straightener. \n\nLiz has started trying to use these things without my permission or knowledge. She does have her own money - she just spends it all at Starbucks or on presents for her boyfriend. But she'll act like the things I've bought myself are hers, too. Or sometimes just hers and not mine at all. Honestly if she just asked to borrow a hair elastic, I'd let her, but she tries to go behind my back about that kind of stuff. After I bought those hair elastics, I freaked out one day because the white one was missing and I really wanted to wear it. I asked if she had seen it, she said no, and after digging around the bathroom I found it with her stuff. I definitely did not leave it there and nobody else goes in there.  And there's just a bunch of other little stuff like that where she tries to use my things. Just tonight, she was yelling across the house at Anne to find her face wash. She doesn't have a face wash. I do. I bought it for myself last week and am keeping it hidden. Because I worked hard for that money and I don't want her just using it all up. I now hide all my things, and for the most part, it works. \n\nI guess I just feel kind of guilty about it. I hate to feel like I'm gatekeeping or trying to \"punish\" her in some way. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677387567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c5ty5/aita_for_hiding_things_from_my_step_sister_to/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get a lock and let your parents know that this is to prevent stuff from going missing in case they ask. Your step mom is doing a bang up job, and creating a brat. Your step sis is obviously an entitled jerk. have you talked to your dad about this?", "NTA. She is. She refused to share stuff her mom bought for her but feels entitled to use your stuff, that you paid for, with money from your job? Hell no. I wouldn't have let her use it even if she had asked.", "NTA, she should have enough respect for you at 16 to not use your stuff without asking, and she especially shouldn't be lying about taking them. Nothing you've done here has been AH like at all", "NTA. I grew up in a chaotic house full of cousins and siblings, and I knew at least one of them would steal anything I didn't have nailed down. To this day I still compulsively hide food I really like just so nobody can steal it, and the only people that live in my house are me and my husband, lol. The point is it's your property, you're not punishing her but she is not entitled to it. I'd look into like a tackle box you can lock.", "NTA. Just please don't make the mistake we did. Kiddo loves her dad's sweatshirts. Old. New. Doesn't matter. She'll steal it off his back as soon as he takes it off. It's become a running joke between the two of them. \n\nHe got a new one and then proceeded to hide it and then forgot where he hid it. She was the one to find it. Very ironic. Keep hiding your stuff, just make sure that you keep good track of it.\n\nAnne is raising an entitled thief who, one of these days, will cross paths with someone who isn't as lenient or graceful as you have been. Quite frankly, despite your dad not feeling comfortable discipling Liz, he does need to step up. This is his house too. He needs to set some ground rules.", "Nta.

Seriously!!!  Lock it up, keep it hidden, and enjoy the things you bought yourself!!!", "NTA. Your money, your things. Tit for tat, imho.", "No, nta. You are so not the asshole here it's painful. Keep hiding your shit and don't be afraid to confront her about stealing it either. Keep your receipts to back yourself up if/when it comes up so that you can prove it's yours. She needs to learn boundaries, and you deserve to hold yours.", "NTA she needs to buy her own stuff.", "NTA\n\nContinue hiding your things. You are absolutely entitled to them & keeping them for yourself. Your step-sister has proven repeatedly she cannot be trusted.", "NTA. She is not entitled to your stuff.  She could spend her own money on these items", "NTA - If she isn't respecting your boundaries with your purchases, then you're under no obligation to allow her to know what you have.", "You know how you wrote that Anne is extremely nice? And in the same sentence you said that she never disciplines her kids? That means she's actually an irresponsible asshole. It is the parent's job to discipline their kids. Parents who don't want to do that, for whatever reason, are failing their children and failing society at large. They are dumping their problems on the rest of us.

The history you have with her (her not letting you borrow her stuff, etc) is irrelevant. You have a right to not want someone else to use your things.  Look at it from the standpoint of: if you moved out and had a roommate, would you be worried about if you\u2019re in the right to keep your things safe? Probably not. This situation really isn\u2019t any different.  Keep bringing it up to your parents. Every time it happens. And put a lock on your door.

Get a lock for your room, and possibly a camera to record the thief.", "To be fair, she hasn't ever tried to go in my room (that I'm aware of).

Its so frustrating when you\u2019re a student with little money and your stuff gets used. My brother married when I was 17 and his wife moved in with us. She used my stuff all the time. I started putting it my room, she\u2019d go in when I went to school, use it and put it back. One time she clearly got frustrated going in every day so decanted half my expensive shampoo into another container.
