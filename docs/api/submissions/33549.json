We\u2019ve never worked with her before but we looked through her available photos and liked her style. Very simple style with no crazy editing.. all outdoor shots. We spent good money on the session that was supposed to last 30 minutes. From start to finish it was 9 minutes and the whole session felt rushed. I was concerned but just trusted that she knows what she is doing and the photos will reflect that. We just got our photos back and she edited fake snow and snowflakes falling in every. single. photo. There is not a single picture that\u2019s doesn\u2019t have fake snow. It looks like absolute shit and the snowflakes falling make the images slightly blurry in spots as if there is a smudges on the camera. For context, it was 60 degree when we took the photos and no snow. Part of me wants to ask for her to remove the fake snow and re-edit the photos... which I know will be a lot of work. Part of me want\u2019s to ask for a refund because she falsely advertised herself and no where in the description of our maternity pictures did she disclose she would be adding fake snow/snowflakes falling. It\u2019s like she took a chance on trying something new with our photos and I would appreciate if she didn\u2019t take risks with a paid service\u2026.. anyways WIBTA?
