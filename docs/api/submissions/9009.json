This has been our arrangement as we recently had a baby, previously I also worked as well. I've recently started taking more pride in my home making and in an attempt to help save money and be more of a help to my partner I have started cooking at home and established more of a routine. I aim to make my husband breakfast and dinner M-F, and weekends are a figure it out yourself deal. I usually wake up first, make breakfast, get baby ready, drop baby to daycare then come home, do class and housework, cook, then get baby.  When hubby gets home I've been making sure dinner is ready.  I've even made a weekly meal plan. I've started doing this consistently as of 2 weeks ago.\n\nSo hubby comes home from a long day eats dinner then winds down and watches some movies. He's a big snacker and he usually finishes his snacks in the same day he buys them. If I want some, he would share but I usually leave him to his snacks or have a nibble at best. The problem is I buy snacks and cereals that I really enjoy, but by the time I get to them, they are done or half gone. I told hubby that it's not fair that he eats all his stuff and then mine. Last time I went to go eat cereal and it was all gone. When I confront him, he acts like I'm crazy to be upset about food and even bought 4 boxes of cereal to show how petty I am. Today I toiled from 6am to about 9pm I made dinner plus his favorite dessert (which he complimented but said he would like them without chocolate chips- i made banana bread) I fell asleep and woke up to him watching a movie then he start sighing and says \"I can't have chips I can't have cereal I can't have anything.\" Referring to my snacks I asked him not to eat. I told him what he was doing wasn't nice and he repeated himself but adds \"its okay though.\" I blew up and told him that he's ungrateful and that I've put in all this effort for him, and he still has the gall to say he can't have anything?! Like, who have I been cooking and baking for!! \n\nHe literally eats every freaking thing I bring. I often don't get to enjoy some of my snacks. I don't mind sharing, but he finishes stuff all the time and doesn't replace it. I should add, however, that his money does buy the grocery. But we're married so it's our money plus I still pay for many things although I don't work. I feel I might be the idiot for throwing in his face all that I do cause he did sound like he was trying to play it off like a joke but I know he was being a tad passive aggressive or shady at the very least. I came upstairs to our room and I'm just annoyed.

First, if he\u2019s eating a full dinner, dessert, and then snacking all night, he\u2019s probably way overeating. Secondly, eating all your snacks is obnoxious and selfish. This has nothing to do with who earns the money. If he buys himself multiple kinds of snacks and eats them all in one night, he needs to buy more snacks at one time, or stop for snacks every night on the way home. But honestly, this sounds unhealthy. A full dinner followed by a full bag of chips chips and a bowl of cereal, then YOUR snacks on top of that, sounds like compulsive eating.", "NTA. Your husband is being inconsiderate. On top of that he\u2019s trying to guilt you into letting him have your snacks. Tell him if he wants some snacks then to stop at the store on the way home and get them. He\u2019s not entitled to eat everything in the house just because he wants to. \n\nYou could get a box/locker and put your snacks in there and put a lock on it. That\u2019s what my SIL did when my brother wouldn\u2019t stop eating her snacks. Now she doesn\u2019t have to worry about him eating everything before she gets to it.", "Nta. You don\u2019t have an issue with sharing your snacks you have an issue with him eating all the household snacks.", "Hide your snacks, girl.", "NTA\n\nif when you try to set boundaries around snacks and he acts like you\u2019re crazy, that\u2019s not cool.  it seems like you\u2019re more than willing to respect his snacks, but he isn\u2019t giving the same courtesy to you.  he could at least ask first.  even if you share funds, you still deserve to have a sense of security in knowing that the food you want to eat will still be there.  at the very least, he could not complain about \u201cnot having anything\u201d when you are putting in a lot of work to cook and make sure he\u2019s fed.\n\nwhy doesn\u2019t he buy extra if it\u2019s a snack that he likes as well?  or he could replace something if you expressed you wanted some and he ate it all.  unless there\u2019s a financial reason for not doing so, it seems like an easy solution.\n\nit\u2019s the immature reactions that\u2019s really pushing towards him being TA tbh.  my partner and i both contribute to food.  we share most things, but we don\u2019t eat the others snacks if asked not to, and if we want some we ask.  on occasional moments of weakness, we at least apologize to the other.  it\u2019s not appropriate to make each other feel bad for something as simple as wanting our own snack.\n\nalso, if you suspect he has BED, being supportive of his struggles is important, but looking after yourself is also important.  it is appropriate to store food in a second location.  if an appropriate time ever arises, it may be good to bring up BED and seeking treatment, but be sure to do lots of research and handle the subject with care.", "NTA. I have the same problem with my husband. When I want onion dip and a single bowl of ruffles chips, I have to buy three party sized bags of chips to be able to get a single bowl of chips. My solution is just to buy a ludicrous amount of snacks because I hate the \"Oh, I'm not ***allowed to eat****\"* hyperbolic dramatic tone*.* Small candies I used to hide in the spice drawer, figuring if he ever cooked for me, he'd see 'em. I also developed a taste for coconut because he hates it and won't touch it. I don't know how to win this fight so I just buy more, lots more. You can try hiding stuff. I never found fighting to work, though.", "NTA\nMy husband and I had the same problem when we first moved in together. A serving size of chips for him was the entire bag. I designated a shelf in a cabinet to my snacks. No touching without asking, and absolutely no eating the last of any of my snacks. He ate the last of my cookies so I changed the wifi password and wouldn't give it to him until he went and bought another package. It only took a few reminders over a couple of months to become a habit of only eating the snacks I bought for him.", "It's not the 1950's where women were expected to sit in a corner and suffer if your spouse isn't being considerate or kind. All you're asking for is some consideration.  My husband used to do the same thing-- we worked out a compromise with him asking if i have plans for <insert food item here> before he snacked on them.Also, and I know it's a little nuts (AND I don't think i should have to) but i occasionally put things in empty tampon boxes that he oddly enough leaves alone.\n\nEDIT to add: NTA", "You are NTA. Your husband is acting selfishly, and if he truly consumes ALL of his snacks in one day, he has an eating disorder. He should talk to a doctor and a therapist.", "NTA\n\nI'm trying to be constructive within particular situation and not pick at it from the outside because I can't see that as helpful here.\n\nIt seems like you have two problems but it might boil down to one.\n\n1. You buy snacks and your husband blows through them.\n2.  This leaves you with no snacks.\n\nYou've not indicated any sort of money problem.\n\nYou could try to set some aside but it seems like that's what's happening here and your husband is getting pissy. \n\nMy simple suggestion would be to buy more snacks but, in an effort to prevent him from blowing through all them, try buying them in twice a week or even three times?", "NTA.  My husband and I used to have this problem.  We came to a solution that has worked very well - I have an area where my snacks go.  If it\u2019s in my area, he can only have it if I offer it to him (and then he can have 1 serving, no more).  He can buy whatever he wants for himself, and there used to pretty often be stuff for both of us (he\u2019s on a diet so there isn\u2019t now), but if it\u2019s on my shelf, it\u2019s off limits to him.", "NTA but your husband sounds like a compulsive eater so I don't think he's doing it to be selfish either. He probably just can't help himself once he starts. I think you should talk to him about addressing that. In the meantime you might consider keeping a back up stash somewhere in the house. I would say just buy more or shop more often but if he eats everything no matter how much there is then that's a different problem.", "NTA, but maybe you just need more snacks? \n\nThen again, it might be unhealthy the amount of snacks he is eating.", "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted for this, but there\u2019s a really easy solution. It may be dysfunctional with adults who should know better, but it\u2019s an approach that works well with kids, binge eaters, etc. \n\nReserve some of your snacks in a second location. Not in the pantry or wherever they\u2019re all kept. When I\u2019m hiding candy from my kids, I keep it on the shelf above baking staples like flour, etc. \n\nOut of sight, out of mind.", "So you explained that he was eating all of the snacks, and his reaction was to have a big sigh and complain that he \"couldn't eat *anything*\". Despite having a full meal earlier.\n\nYou also made his favourite meal, but after eating he suggested alterations. \n\nINFO: Are you married to my daughter? She is 5, so that would be incredibly inappropriate.", "NTA you could buy a buttload of snacks or have a snack stash for just you. My ex husband ate my period chocolate and I about ate his head off. I wouldn't have cared if he replaced it. After that I hid a small stash where he wouldn't find it. \n\nMy current husband leaves certain snacks alone or if he eats them goes out the next day to replace them for me.", "Buy so many snacks. An overload of snacks. A plethora of snacks. An epidemic of snacks. So many good snacks there is no more room for arguments. And then, just to be sure\u2026. Buy a few more.", "NTA but your husband is an immature AH. My wife and I have our own separate snacks and some common ones and for our separate ones we NEVER cross boundaries.  Your husband is only thinking \u201cme me me\u201d and hasn\u2019t listened to anything you\u2019ve said about YOUR snacks. He\u2019s an immature snack disposal machine.", "Am I the only one wondering what\u2019s up from a health standpoint? That much snacking on top of regular meals can\u2019t be healthy. NTA for wanting to reserve some of your treats if he\u2019s already blown through his.\n\nHas he gained weight on this set up? Maybe it\u2019s worthy of portioning things so you get some and he doesn\u2019t end up overeating and overweight.", " NTA. But hide your food so he can\u2019t find it.", "NTA- he sounds like a child. How unattractive.", "ESH\nYou're both tiring.  He's being totally passive aggressive.  He's allowed to say he doesn't like chocolate chips, but not be whiny about it.  You're also being whiny.  And if, it's \"our money\" it's \"our food\" and \"our snacks\" and \"our cereal,\" right?", "I think ESH. I think an easy solution would be to simply buy more snacks so that he has more to go through before even touching your stuff is an issue. At the end of the day it's his money you're spending (in your words), and he is the one eating an unholy amount of snack foods, so why not just buy an unholy amount for him. I think in his eyes everything is shared (the money and the snacks), he just happens to eat the shared snacks more than you, and now you are setting boundaries on that shared stuff when you could simply get more shared stuff. As funny as it is, i think his petty move to buy extra cereal is actually the solution, he was just an ass in the way he went about it.\n\ntldr:  I think the boundaries make you an ass, and his pettiness makes him one.", "Can\u2019t you just buy more snacks? Put them in a different spot? \n\nDid you only start making dinners two weeks ago? \n\nYou both seem childish.", "NAH.\n\nI get why this is frustrating to you. But in a shared household with shared money, ususally the stuff bought with this money is shared too. So it's as much his snacks as yours. \n\nWhat needs to change is: Having enough of them for both of you, and replacing everything that's running out so you don't miss out on the stuff you want to have. \nSo if he eats them, he has to get more of them asap.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
