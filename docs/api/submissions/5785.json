YOU wanted to leave. You didn't want them removed. You wanted yourself removed. Your uncle is the one that kicked them out.

It's not some kind of YA novel where Liam is curling his mustache laughing mianically when trying to steal your dad and replace you in your family. Was he an asshole? Yes. But you had an upper hand there and you could have played that so much smoother. Instead you'll probs allienate your dad and eventually rest of the family.\n\nGet help.", "YTA. Why make trouble? Can\u2019t you just ignore him and be civil for a few hours?", "YTA, although I think that is being too nice! In the comments you say that you went there to ruin their christmas. I hope your uncle will come to his senses and kick you out next time.", "YTA and unhinged for deliberately planning to sabotage Christmas and admitting to it in one of your comments.  You need help, lots of it.", "YTA. It seems you are trying to cause trouble just because Liam has gotten on well with your dad. Good for them for establishing a good relationship, they're family now. You are a huge part of the family, but you don't want to get to know the stepmother because you don't like her. Okay. You dont have to, so thats fair. \nAlthought you cannot exclude yourself from these kind of familysituations just because you are jelous of their relationship, this is kind of obvious.\n FYI he wont steal your father.\n\nTalk to your father and let him understand how you feel.", "YTA, way to spread disharmony for Christmas. Your uncle's a buttmunch for going along with it, too.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure your uncle doesn\u2019t like your Dad\u2019s new family very much either and Liam sounds like a big gaping asshole.", "NTA\n\nLiam was making a show about how much he'd bonded with your dad. This understandably annoyed you, especially since your dad did nothing to stop this obnoxious behaviour. \n\nYour uncle.was the host and it was his decision to ask them to leave. He saw what was happening and has every right to ask obnoxious teenagers to leave his home.\n\nYour dad now has ample time to dote on the new people he has brought into his life. I'm glad your family has your back, that Liam must have been very careless while he was there.", "NTA. You tried to leave and your uncle removed them. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't demand your uncle to kick out dad and Liam. You asked to leave, repeatedly, but your uncle decided otherwise.", "Youre the asshole and so are your aunt and uncle for asking your dad to leave instead of you.  I love that his name is Liam lmao it makes it even more fitting that he\u2019s a little schmuck too.  Instead of being a baby you should have put Liam in his place.  You had home field advantage and wasted it. Nothing he was doing warranted the scene you caused though.", "You know what YTA. But hey, I'd do the same shit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You ARE trying to mislead us in the post however.", "NTA. \n\nYou owe your uncle. Good to see he doesn't tolerate drama in his home. Your dad needs to grow up and recognize when other males in his life is stirring up BS but he is divorced for a reason so it shouldn't be much of a surprise if you ever find out another dude and his naive blindness to lack of care for his relationship was the cause of past relationship failures.", "NTA.", "Liam also doesn't need to be a dick in the house of someone he doesn't know.

He was trying to ruin mine so I ruined his instead", "She admitted to it in another comment, it was her plan all along. Liams comments were just her excuse and she\u2019s pleased with herself.  OP is a pathetic child.", "How do you know that Liam hasn't already replaced OP in her  dad's affections?

No one even cared when they left", "She literally just admitted to me her plan going in was to get them kicked out and show her family cares more about her than them and that she\u2019s happy because they didn\u2019t even have a chance to eat anything.  You\u2019re getting played by a child lmao.", "I did.

I'm saying not to go there with a malicious intent to show who's the boss.\nShe says she doesnt even care abour her dad and Liam can have him. Well, if that were true she wouldnt have arranged this whole unhinged spectacle and then boast about it on reddit.\nI realise that she's super young with a lot of emptions, but seriously, reading her comments gave me the creeps.", "Either co-exist or you\u2019re the one who leaves. Sounds like that\u2019s what you offered so you were within your rights to go home if you truly let Liam push your buttons to the point you can\u2019t stay (which you would also explore why you give him that kind of power over you but that\u2019s work for you in therapy not on Christmas Day.) But it just feels really immature to have your uncle throw them out. Either you were behaving victimized or mabye your uncle has issues with him/them anyway.", "You need help", "OP is a kid who's lost her dad to a second marriage.

Every family has a Liam but not every family has an awesome uncle that will boot his ass out of the house.", "Liam is that you?", "Nah, your dad is your uncles brother and his wife is now more family to them than your mother is. You\u2019ve given no reason for why you dislike your step mom and you\u2019re a child so the reasoning is likely invalid unless she was fucking your dad while he was married.  You caused a scene because a person named Liam made you upset instead of directly making him look like an asshole in front of everyone.  His name is fucking Liam it should\u2019ve been easy. You lose. You\u2019re a loser.", "YTA. And a pathetic one at that", "It's her parents fault though that she feels insecure. Her dad is responsible to create a healthy dynamic here.", "Im actually really happy", "I'm not gonna show courtesy to a stranger who is trying to make me upset", "She obviously does care about her dad otherwise Liam rubbing his relationship with dad on her face wouldn't have mattered her. She would be indifferent. Seems like she's feeling replaced, helpless and in no control of the situation so she did this to show that she still has control. Then how were the uncle so comfortable throwing his brother out, definitely the father here is a problem that no one seems to like him. So while her actions might be assholish but they are understandable.", "I didnt arrange anything. It was just a last minute plan to teach him its a bad idea to go to someones home and insult them. did he expect my family to take his side?", "He doesnt have that kind of power over me I was showing him how much power I have.

You said it was your plan all along to get them kicked out.  Child.", "Well he could have had a word to Liam about taunting his daughter at the Christmas gathering and he didn't.

Care to tell your side of the story?", "i didn't say that Liam", "Liam was saying how well he gets along with his stepdad. That doesn't sound like taunting.

Hey my parents aren't divorced but if I was in a situation like this I might have done the same.

Hence the public display.\n\nOPs better option would have been to call dad to a special meeting with her uncle in attendance to make sure her concerns were listened to and her dad made accountable for some tangible actions to help OP with the new family dynamic.", "I dont have daddy issues.

It was my uncle's and he was fine with it", "Yeah you did Bethany", "OP I do think this behaviour was a little assholish but understandable, I probably would have done the same thing. Also you're funny.", "He was rubbing it in OPs face that he gets to be with her dad all the time. Shiny new son syndrome. \n\nOP does need help.
