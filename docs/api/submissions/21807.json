I've been doing this since I was 14 and I have a very good reputation with lots of repeat clients that trust me.

We had agreed that I would be watching their two children from five pm until midnight. The kids were seven and nine so it was going to be easy. \n\nWhen I showed up there were six children. I guess it was a group date night for this family and their friends and they decided, without asking me, that I would be babysitting all their kids.\n\nMy mom was still in the driveway so I turned around and went to the car. The people I had agreed to babysit for freaked out and came running to the car. I asked them if they had arranged sitters for the other four kids and they said that I should be able to handle it.  I said fuck that and asked my mom to take me home. \n\nThey said they would pay me what they agreed for the evening and pay for the other kids at the end of the night.  I said no. I said I wasn't going to be responsible for six kids. I said six is three times as many kids so I wanted three times as much money because I would have to get my sister or one of my friends to help.  I said that if they thought that wasn't fair I had no problem leaving and they could find someone else.  \n\nThey agreed and I said I wanted to be paid up front. The husband pulled out his wallet and paid me.  My mom stayed with me until my dad brought my little sister to help me wrangle the kids. \n\nThey were home by 11:45 and my mom picked us up. \n\nBut now they are complaining on the neighborhood group that I am an asshole for holding them hostage for more money. \n\nI think a deal is a deal and I wasn't the one who tried to change it to begin with. \n\nINFO. \nI paid my sister $125 because I did all the hard work.

They are lucky it was only triple you charged.", "NTA You agreed to babysit a couples'  two children and they pulled a bait and switch. These Einstein's figured they'd pay for one sitter and dump all the kids on the sitter and split the cost.

You agreed with two children, the minute that number changed they should have been in contact with you to change the arrangement. They probably just assumed you would go along with it, so good for you for standing up to that. \n\nI used to babysit and the most I did was seven children between three couples aged 1yr-10yr.
