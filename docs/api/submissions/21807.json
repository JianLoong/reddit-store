The only reason he didn't get it was because one of the little girls told me he was allergic.

I also gave you the option of paying nothing when I discovered that you had added four additional children to be cared for, as I did not feel comfortable taking that job at all when the terms were changed. You asked me to make it work and offered to pay more; I needed additional help to watch six children, so I had to pay my helper.\n\nI am not sure why you expected me to watch six children for the same rate as two children, or why you would be comfortable leaving a teenager in charge of six children, or why you did not attempt to notify me of the change in advance, but that scenario was simply impossible to accommodate at the rate I quoted you.\u201d", "She is 17, a teenager, not an adult. She did am amazing job shutting this shit down.", "You have *no idea* when or where this was. How can you say that with such confidence?", "She's not an adult. She's 17.

It's definitely not irrelevant though. In a child care setting the ratios are a lot higher than that. You'd get a class of 30 for one teacher and a teaching assistant.", "you are right", "I love your response and I hope she uses it!", "The way everyone demand service workers remain gracious no matter the abuse they face says a lot about how you all view them.", "[removed]", "It would be low if she was babysitting 1, but she rarely babysits for fewer than 2 or 3 so its in line with local rates. But this is a good question. I'm going to suggest she ask her friends what they charge.", "In a classroom with a teacher and assistant, however, you have two people working as a team.  Which gives flexibility to enhance safety.  While one person works with the group as a whole, the other can deal with individual students one-on-one as needed.\n\nPlus, in a school, they also have the routine of the classroom setting, and organized activities to keep the children busy and out of trouble.  \n\nAnd in a school, you can call for help, if needed.  The principal, school nurse (if you have one), or a teacher or assistant from another classroom.  \n\nSix kids for one person, with no warning to plan activities for that many kids, is very different from a teacher and assistant with a planned curriculum in a classroom of a known and predictable sized class.", "Bad bot. \n\nI assume this is a comment stealing bot because your comment makes precisely zero sense here.", "I would definitely check on current rates because when I was babysitting back around 1998-2004 I charged $20/hr for two kids and would add for each additional kid (how much extra varied depending on my relationship with the family). And that's for older kids, when I sat infants or toddlers I would up it to $25+ an hr for two, again changed depending on the kids/family. And then, anything later than midnight (when I was younger in the 90s) / 2am (once I was an older teenager in high school) I would charge extra for the later hours. Now, I did live in an affluent area in the midwest but nothing crazy.", "I was getting at least $20 an hour & pizza in the late '90s. I don't have kids, but it must've gone up, especially with the price of daycare these days.", "NTA\n\nI'd put your side up on their complaint just so everyone can see.. or ask a lawyer about damages", "They didn\u2019t just try to rip you off. They were actively trying to endanger six single-digit-old children by leaving them all in the hands of ONE person who told them clearly and upfront she can\u2019t handle them on her own.

The whole thing sounded fishy, you must defend yourself.", "NTA\nThey were talking advantage on the situation thinking you would have no choice but babysit all of them without extra money. You were right by asking more money couse 6 kids are not a joke to handle.", "A lot of young people are struggling to stand up for themselves and a lot of adults think they would get away with treating young adults like shit because they think their age gives them a position of authority.

I\u2019m my experience having to offload babysitter work because i had to do some remote work and it was the standard standard $20-30 for 1-2 children and after that you pay x per additional child. That\u2019s standard babysitting rates and they were probably hoping to take advantage of the OPs age and save money which isn\u2019t okay for somebody that young", "You deserve praise for upholding your standards. One individual has a lot of work to do with six children.", "The sister was an assistant and not the responsible person should anything happen.

But (depending on the country) 17 is usually still considered a minor/teenager. Not an adult.\n\nAnd NTA, OP. Regardless of age, you still did the right thing. \n\nYou could be a 40yr old woman who's birthed 20 kids yourself. But you agreed to look after 2 kids of certain ages. Them dumping 6 kids on you and thinking that's ok is not good.\n\nAnd good on you for demanding payment upfront! Chances are that they would have tried to avoid payment after.\n\nDefinitely try to defend yourself in the group chat and explain things. You agreed to look after 2 kids. They tried to dump 6 kids on you. You wanted them to be safe, so you had to get extra help in, which requires additional payment for that helper.", "Shit, my parents don't drink. At all. It's not a religious or a \"drink is evil\" type thing, it's that they planned on having three kids, had them, we were small and they decided that would be the most responsible of them.

This meant they could always drive, always be on top of whatever happened, even if something happened to one of them, the other was there too.

I babysat from 1996-2000ish and would often get around $5 an hour, Canadian. Less than minimum wage.

Also 2008 was a major recession so that probably affected what you were able to charge as well. The years I babysat were better years economically in the US at least."]}
