I've literally never come across a joint that had tobacco in it.", "what joints have \u201ca whole load of tobacco\u201d in them...?", "Y\u2019all don\u2019t go to a lot of concerts. That\u2019s cool. But you\u2019re not accurate here.", "I mean, festival culture literally evolved from concert culture. People have been lighting up joints at concerts, both indoors and out since at least the 1960s. If you don't expect it, you must be playing at being an ostrich.", "Going to a concert that is known for its drug culture and crying about someone doing drugs there is absolutely playing victim.", "So, you world expect a Snoop Dogg concert to be completely drug free? The artists themselves light up at these concerts. She can't put the blame on one concert goer in a drug filled environment", "^he knows, he\u2019s lying to get Reddit sympathy. Stop replying to this clown", "Then I suggest you look up local laws regarding smoking in enclosed public places.  I think you're likely to find that smoking indoors is illegal.", "Then YTA for lighting up in a public venue and not caring if it's even legal to do so.", "a joint with tobacco in it is a spliff. they literally have different names bc a joint by definition does not contain tobacco.", "I do, not in the US granted, but if u did that here u would be kicked out in seconds- everyone just does it before they go in if they\u2019re gonna do it\n\nBut thanks for the assumption concert expert!", "I don\u2019t expect any concert to be drug free. \n\nSmoke away!  In the seat before someone else shows up, in aisle, or whatever.  Just not in your seat when other people are jammed next to you.  Same goes for cigarettes.", "Dude says he's from the US, and I'm pretty sure it's illegal to smoke inside everywhere that isn't a private residence.", "Yeah that's what I thought but since I'm not in the US I didn't want to make that blanket statement", "There's some bars in some states that still allow it, but in my experience they're vanishingly rare. I highly doubt any concert venue with assigned seats would be one of them.", "That's not remotely true. Many states don't have indoor smoking bans. Of course, if you look at the states where smoking indoors is still legal, it's not exactly a who's who of states with progressive marijuana laws. \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/factsheets/sfia/SmokeFreeIndoorAir.html#:\\~:text=As%20of%20December%2031%2C%202022%2C%2028%20states%20(Arizona%2C,Utah%2C%20Vermont%2C%20Washington%2C%20and", "You were better off not, the statement is categorically false.", "Wow I had no idea. I haven't been in a place in the US that's allowed indoor smoking since probably 2010.", "Damn. I had no idea.", "There's a local bar in my hometown that's grandfathered into it so long as they don't make any changes to the building. They recently lost their smoking license for a few days due to bureaucratic reasons and the entire place was dead. The smoking is really the only draw the place has anymore."]}
