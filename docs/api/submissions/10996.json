Its fair if you didnt know about ESH I was just confused", "Smoking in public is illegal. Concert seats are not a designated smoking area.", "Smoking is everywhere and that\u2019s why smoking indoors and sometimes outdoors is becoming illegal, thankfully.

I\u2019m not even sure I could count how many concerts I\u2019ve been to in my life time. I\u2019ve had exactly zero people light a joint next to me. Do some people smoke at concerts? Of course.

My dad has photos from the 1975 Eric Clapton concert in Melbourne and there is joints everywhere!", "Oh please--OP has dodged over and over again the question of whether  what they were doing was even legal in the place where they were doing it. The couple could easily have assumed that, at a bare minimum, other audience members would obey the law when asked.", "Well that\u2019s simply not fucking true. \n\nIt depends on the venue. Obviously. If it\u2019s assigned seating odds are much higher the venue itself is non-smoking (especially in the US, that varies a lot by country)", "Where does it say that smoking is allowed in the rules of the venues?", "They say they are 'no smoking' places because they legally have to, but they deliberately do not enforce it and you can smoke in front of security.

Everyone I've seen roll their own it has been a mix. I don't know if it's because they also smoke cigarettes that are just tobacco as well but that's been my experience.

You're an idiot. \n\nNow if you told me you went to see Taylor Swift and got upset with someone next to you smoking, I would understand. \n\nYou need to know where you're going and what the people there are going to do as you can't control other people. These people took a risk. I can guarantee you, if it wasn't this person smoking next to them it was someone else.", "No, but smoke is not supposed to be in our lungs. So yes, still dangerous.", "Yes, they have found the smoke contains many of the same cancer causing substances.", "Idk about cancer specifically, but it is dangerous still", "This is coming from someone who thinks it's reasonable to get upset about people smoking weed at an event where you know there will be people smoking weed.", "If it's illegal then page security.

Just accept that I'm right and you are - misguided- and this will go a lot more smoothly.", "Honestly if it was a Phish show or like Afroman or something I would say NTA. It really depends on the show. People all on their high horses about second hand smoke, but with some concerts you just have to be realistic. If 90% percent of the crowd is lighting up, then the pregnant lady had to know what she was getting into.", "So kinda like what OP is describing?", "That's my whole point, like she knew what she was getting into but still trying to put the blame on someone else instead of just taking some accountability.", "Nobody asks consent of their concert neighbours to smoke a joint lol wtf are you talking about ?

I totally get people want to be people, but like, sometimes I vibe with a good band too and just wish I could enjoy it without dying of a hard cough and painful lungs after.", "Either way, it is the culture to smoke at a lot of shows. As a pregnant woman, whether its right or not, i\u2019m not going to go anyways just to prove some point. People smoke at concerts and venues rarely make a fuss. Some even encourage it.

It\u2019s more tame now but I still have to carry an inhaler for long distance travel.", "Sure I'm an asshole because I am realistic on what to expect. Def not part of the problem being that I don't smoke nor do I contribute to the cloud of smoke at said venues/concerts, but I know what to expect from over 25 years of concert going. I make my decision on which bands to see based on what I know is going to happen at those shows. \n\nExample: I no longer get GA/ pit tickets for heavy shows knowing a pit may break out and I don't want to deal with that shit. \n\nThis pregnant person decides to go to a Gwar show with pit tickets* and asks those around them to please not do what one does in a pit.\n\nEdited for spelling*", "I didn\u2019t say they weren\u2019t.

Cigarette smoke seems to hit me the worst. Before I was diagnosed I used to cough so hard I'd nearly pass out or just vomit everywhere. Sometimes being around smokers for even a few minutes can trigger that. It's so brutal that people who smoke in venues like this can't find even a shred of empathy for others around them", "I think it's high time people start showing some empathy and thought for those around them. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. People are just assholes, and I'm allowed to expect people to show some respect. There's literally so many other options available to assholes that choose to smoke, but for the sake of culture fuck everyone else right?  It's my opinion, smoking has already been phased out of public areas and buildings for a reason. It still makes everyone that chooses to light up in an area like that an asshole. Whether it's \"expected\" or not.", "Not at all. A hookah bar is about smoking. A concert is about listening to music. \n\nYour insult because people don\u2019t agree with you just further proves that you\u2019re an AH like the op.", "So, if you were pregnant and purchased tickets to a show for GA/Pit knowing that a mosh pit may break out and you may get punched, kicked, and  elbowed in the face, legs, stomach and other places, would you get upset with the other people or yourself for putting you and your un born baby in the situation? \n\nI'm not asking to be an ass, I'm 100% curious. This is an expected behavior at some shows. Would you still go because people should be empathetic? Are you going to stop everyone from doing the expected behavior?", "A hookah bar is about hanging with your friends, listening to music and smoking, the EXACT same things that people do at a concert with a heavy drug culture.", "1. This isn't about mosh pits, but to humor you: To avoid that, I would go to assigned seating where that's less likely to happen (which is where OP said they were for the record)\n2. Moshing isn't the same as smoking (ETA you can typically steer clear of moshes. Smoking is so much more difficult to remove yourself from). It doesn't seem to matter what kind of show I'm at, there's always some asshole lighting up because they have zero regard for anyone else around them. Drug culture or not. \n3. Yeah it is a risk I take as an asthmatic because I can't shelter myself away from the public my whole life just because I was born with shitty lungs.\n4. I am allowed to be pissed off at people for smoking where they shouldn't be, and I'm also allowed to have the opinion that they are assholes for defending it. \n\nI've also been to shows with heavy drug culture and moshes. I found a way to stay off to the side away from it, but I was also much younger and not pregnant. I dug the show, not the chaos. It's a bit easier to avoid the mosh than it is to avoid the smoke.\n\nWhen there is such a simple solution like hitting up a smoking area instead of lighting up in a crowd of assigned seats, I have much less sympathy for you when you're called an asshole."]}
