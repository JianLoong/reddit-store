However, our other friends don't see it as annoying because \"it's just who she is\". Now I do understand that you can't change people. However, the amounts of times we have made bookings for a restaurant or arcade or bowling she has always made us late and we usually don't end up doing out plans that night. \n\nBack to the story:\nWhen we were planning to go out I had given a time 15 minutes earlier than what is ideal just so if she was late, we would still have time. Once again I had asked suzie if she was okay with the times and that I would leave after 15 minutes. She kept saying to stop being so uptight and that the time was perfect. The day arrives and I call her to let her know I am waiting for her. She says okay and said that she will be ready in 5 and be out in 10. 10 minutes passed and she wasn't out. I decided to call her again and she says that she will be out in 5 and that she just had to go to the bathroom. 5 minutes had passed again and I decided to call her mom and her mom told me that she was watching Netflix and wasn't even ready. After talking to her mom for 5 minutes, I decided to leave and watch the movie myself and put my phone on silent. \n\nAfter I had gotten home, I saw 30 missed calls and like 100 messages to berate me and ask why I didn't wait for her. I had reminded her that I informed her before that if I had waited 15 minutes and she wasn't out, I would leave. Now some of my friends are calling me an AH because she really wanted to watch this movie but I made her miss it and that if I really wanted to watch the movie with her I should have booked a later time.

It also has to be mentioned that she was actively lying to you so she could watch Netflix. Giving you fake info and clearly inaccurate ETA.  That shows a disrespect deeper than just being bad at time management. That was intentional on her end to call your bluff and power play. Who needs those kind of friends?", "NTA.

She\u2019s being inconsiderate and she knows it. I could understand if it was a minor inconvenience that made her a little late or she had informed you before but neither of those things happened. If seeing the movie was really that important to her she wouldn\u2019t be glued to Netflix ( it wouldn\u2019t be much better but at least more convenient if she was ready but just distracted. I\u2019ve done that a couple of time too). I have a cousin like this, and we\u2019ve just given up on waiting up for her all the time. She\u2019s 31 so much older than you or your friend but she\u2019s been this way her whole life. We usually just do whatever without her if she doesn\u2019t show up on time. At first she would get angry but once she owned up to it she accepted that sometimes she just wouldn\u2019t get to do certain things because she can\u2019t handle being on time for once in her life. The only time she\u2019s ever on time is Christmas Eve dinner because she hates being the last to get food due to our giant family\ud83d\ude02", "NTA and you should refuse to make time specific plans with her.

I am genuinely confused how she thought this was going to work.  The movie starts when it starts.  Was she expecting you to wait for her indefinitely and be late?  Or just not go at all?  Your friend group has taught her they will wait forever and if they have to cancel reservations/plans so be it.  You guys need to start telling her to meet you at the place and then if she shows up late she misses out.  Don\u2019t wait for her to go places, meet there, so her lateness only impacts her.  Eventually she\u2019ll learn to be on time or you\u2019ll stop inviting her.

There's being bad with time management and then there's lying to your friend that you're getting ready when you're watching Netflix instead. She is showing you she values her time and not yours. I would either continue to give her hard times to be ready by or you're leaving, or maybe even better, drive separately. She probably asks for rides because she enjoys people waiting on her. Just meet there and she can miss whatever you have planned but you can enjoy it. Tbh though, I'd probably stop making plans with a person like this. Be friendly to them when you see them and have more of an acquaintance relationship. Don't go do something with people who don't respect you.", "NTA. The movie wouldn\u2019t wait for her to start, either you both miss it or just she misses it. Consequences are the only way to train \u201clate people\u201d. Letting them get away with being late just confirms they have the power to show up whenever and people will cater to them.", "NTA. If others are ok with her always being late that is their business. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to. And clearly she didn\u2019t want to watch the movie that badly if she was watching Netflix when she was already late.

You're welcome to join us.\"  Then leave it to her, if she shows up on time she gets to watch the movie with you, if she's late she misses part of the movie, and if she's extremely late she misses you entirely.  Same thing for arcade & bowling - \"Hey, we're going bowling on x date at y time, would love to have you join.\"  I wouldn't wait to start activities for everyone to arrive, set a start time and if you're there great, but if not you can jump in when you do arrive.  But I'd stop being her ride.

I've no doubt that you knew that if she wasn't already getting ready, that she wasn't going to be out in time to make the movie, even if she'd started doing so right then. Her mom clearly agrees with you, given that she paid you back for the cost of her daughter's ticket.\n\nTo me, the biggest issue isn't that Suzie was distracted with doing something else, though what she was distracted with was not the greatest. It wasn't even directly that she wasn't getting ready. Its that she was blatently lying to you about what she was doing.\n\nThe lying says she knew what she was occupied with was a problem but didn't care enough about you to stop and get ready. That she fully intended to string you along until she was good and ready to join you. Which might have been immediately after the end of the show she was watching, or it might not have.\n\nWas it bad that she was watching Netflix? By itself, no. If she'd been ready, was just burning time, and stopped when you arrived, it would have been fine. If she'd just needed to do a couple of things to get ready, stopped watching and done them in a timely manner, it could have been acceptible.\n\nThis by itself could be seen as poor judgement or something like time blindness. With blatant lying in the mix, it becomes a lack of respect.\n\nIs this a friendship ending level issue? Maybe. Maybe not. It depends on whether you've caught her in lies before. But it is worth setting some boundaries.\n\nBest would be to stop giving her rides and stop waiting for her to show. If she misses out on stuff because the rest of you didn't wait, it will either be the wake-up call she needs, or show the friend group how little effort she's really willing to make to participate.\n\nStop paying for her tickets to do stuff too. If she wants to join, let her get her own. There's a fair chance she'll miss out on stuff because she won't even do that in a timely manner.", "NTA, I got a feeling this is her method of feeling she's in demand / \"wanted by everyone when they all chase her. \n\nVery soon she'll realise everyone is more interested in  having fun as part of the group, more than anyone person. \n\nWon't be surprised if she doesn't change this will completely backfire on her and she'll end up isolating herself, probably with illusions of grandeur", "Nothing's stopping Suzie from seeing this movie except her own inability to show up on time.

They are either really dumb or just as inconsiderate. Life is too short for this idiotic drama.\n\nNot the AH.", "NTA - being 5 to 10 minutes late is about all that\u2019s acceptable. I had a \u201cfriend\u201d like Suzie in high school too. It\u2019s not just infuriating, it\u2019s downright rude. There is absolutely no excuse. And the fact that she was watching Netflix?!? That would be the last time I made plans with her.", "NTA, but give your friends the context that she was lying about leaving", "Omfg, I would drop this friend so fast. That's so incredibly disrespectful of everyone else's time. If you can't even show me the basic respect of showing up when you agreed to, there's no future for us. Just no. Nta. She's only doing it because people have continued allowing her to do so. All your friends need to carry on with whatever plans you all had until she starts showing up on time and stop waiting for her", "You didn\u2019t make her miss anything, she chose to miss it. Her time management sucks and that\u2019s not a personality trait. Even if it\u2019s a result of a mental illness of sorts, that\u2019s no excuse. \n\nNTA. Hold her to her word. If she says 10 minutes and she\u2019s not there, go live your life. You shouldn\u2019t have to wait around for her. In fact, tell her the time is 2 hours before the actual time.", "NTA. I hope you were able to enjoy the movie despite all the drama your friend caused by being so late. I saw Suzume twice and was only lukewarm on it the first time, but absolutely fell in love the second time! :D", "NTA\n\nYour friend sucks", "Suzie is a straight-up @$$ & the rest of those jokers that are calling her a friend & giving you grief arent much better, especially after knowing she\u2019s sitting on her Princess-@&$ watching Netflix. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t value your time, your opinion. Why are you friends with her? Drop her ridiculous behind. \n\nNTA", "NTA!  Good job following through with your promise. Some people do not care about others and their time.", "I\u2019m absolutely using this, thank you. \ud83d\ude02", "I have a friend like this, too!  We're old enough to have teenagers your age, and she's still doing it.  Worse yet, she's blamed the kids for her habitual tardiness, as though as the parent, she somehow has no control over when her kids get ready for stuff.  She has made her kids late for important things more times than I can remember.    Make your plans and stick with it.  She will either learn or she won't, but it's not on you to teach her.", "She might be the biggest asshole in the Galaxy haha. Watching Netflix, telling you she was almost out the door? Eff that, you're NTA", ">I decided to call her mom and her mom told me that she was watching Netflix and wasn't even ready.\n\nA Suzie at rest stays at rest.", "This happens so commonly. We think that people change/mature as they grow up but that\u2019s not always true. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself.", "Well if you lie about how ready you are and only realize it until the movie is literally finished then i don't know what to tell ya. As she gets older and makes different friends, she's going to have to learn not everyone will wait. There was a story on here where a dude thought he was at most 10-15 minutes late, but his friends accidentally told him the wrong time and they had been fed up with previous infractions that they just left him at the restaurant AFTER he arrived. They soon after realized their mistake when he came to them confused. But the fact is, adults will not tolerate this. They have plans and schedules because life isn't waiting for them to get off the couch after lying to friends. So no, you are NTA", "Ugh I had this exact problem when I was younger. Both with the friend that was always late and the friend group that didn't seem to mind.\n\nThe girl's lateness ended up affecting her school work to the point where teachers offered her extensions, but she didn't graduate because.... She turned in her final papers late.\n\nI lost touch with her and those friends after high school. Unfortunately I don't think she ever really changed.", "Wait, what are your friends complaining about then? If she didn't even notice till the movie was done, then that's 2 hours that flew by. \n\nYou were an AH for leaving? But she didn't even leave her couch?\n\nDo your friend not know all the details?", "NTA - She can still go watch the movie.  In face, she can PAY FOR YOU to go see the movie with her, and pay for all the snacks and transportation.\n\nI seriously don't understant how people tolerate this kind of always-late abuse.  I've had friends who were late once in a blue moon, or arrived at a group event later than others, but everyone came separately and when they wanted, so I was no issue.  Absent people were always considered absent, and NOT part of the activities. \n\nTell you late friend - *\"This BUS don't wait if you're late.\"*", "NTA.  If she REALLY wanted to watch the movie, then she would've gotten her butt to the theater on time.  Like any other normal person.", "NTA Susie has zero respect for others and it seems like her mom just doesn't care to correct her. I know several people like that and the whole \"thats just how they are\" excuse is bs. It's not hard to be ontime, ESPECIALLY as a teenager. You gave her plenty of time and plenty of warning.", "NTA. And I say this as someone who is lateness challenged. I have tons of coping strategies to avoid being late because I have time blindness. For things like movies where it has a set time, there's not much wiggle room. The fact that she lied about getting ready is the kicker for me - you handled it very well.", "NTA. You had a booking, the cinema wasn't going to wait for your friend to finish watching Netflix, so why would you miss it?", "NTA. Your friends are idiots.", "People like you are (sometimes) the reason people like Susie learn, by the time they reach adulthood, the reasons they should be on time to things. NTA.", "OMG, NTA, I hate people who do this.  I grew up with a mother that was late to everything.  Have to be at the dentist at 3, we'll be there at 4-4:30ish and then she'll yell at the receptionist until they let us be seen. Same for dr appointments,  PTA meetings,  Oh those nights at school where they have the books for sale.  The ones with the Garfield and Far side books, yep, all the good books gone by the time we get there, if they are still open. Reservation at a restaurant, yep late for that.   No reservation, every one sitting around waiting for an hour or more.   Once I was old enough, all times got pushed by an hour.  If we had to be there at 5, I'd tell her 4 and she's still be late.  She just runs on her own time and It drives me nuts.  She's got a lot better now that she's retired but damn that drove me crazy growing up, so many missed events.\n\nI've learned to do this same thing with friends once I was an adult but ultimately those people end up getting left behind cause I get tired of waiting.  I also refuse to buy anyones, anything anymore.  If you want me to buy it, give me the money FIRST and then I'll buy it.", "This girl would fail out of college, or lose her employment, in no time.\n\nWhy does she have to see this film with YOU?", "NTA - she really wanted to watch Netfix.", "Does she have ADHD?Or is she diagnosed with another neurodivergance (they tend to have over lapping symptoms)? If not that this behaviour is not acceptable in any shape or form. It is a lack of respect a d shows that she does not care about her friends at all.", "If you were going to watch a movie you BOTH would have been late to see the movie and neither of you would have been able to see it surely? \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You literally cannot \"book a later time\" for someone who is deliberately always late.  The simple fact that she lied to you - twice - while you were waiting for her and her mom said she was watching Netflix and hadn't even started getting ready means it is all on her.  \n\nYou did not make her miss the movie, she did.  She can just book herself a different time and see if she can actually get there when all the planning is on her.", "NTA. And I think you need new friends. \n\nSusie is rude and doesn\u2019t respect anyone. So long as no one calls her on it she has no incentive to change.", "NTA. She made herself miss it.", "The only reason we were watching together because this was the last chance to watch it in theatres so I booked together", "She has ADD", "Did he get to work on time?  How does he keep a job?", "No, you're not uptight.  This is a horrible habit and it also is extremely disrespectful of other people.  I worked with a woman who never changed her ways.  Her husband was invited to Obama's first inauguration.  They didn't get in because Linda was late.  She was supposed to be at work two days later.  She didn't show up because Linda was late and they missed their plane.  Her grandkid was getting a prestigious award at their school.  Linda didn't get to see the presentation and the kid's speech because she was late.  She would go into a panic on some Friday afternoons because she had a Monday morning deadline on something she hadn't even started on and would run around begging the rest of us to help her.  I could go on and on.  Suffice to say that we all hated working with Linda and she was constantly in hot water with the boss.  Suzie is a kid now but she is going to face a hard time when she grows up.  You're actually do her (and her mom) a favor by not tolerating this behavior.  Because, trust me, it won't work for her in the real world.", "NTA. The behaviour you've described is a whole other level of disrespect, it's outrageous. It would be one thing if you were meeting at the theatre and she did this, or f she rushed to get ready when you called the first time (I have executive function issues so I understand losing track of time). But to answer your call, *lie to you* and still not even start getting ready is some pathological nonsense. I'd stop inviting her to stuff.", "Nta. And chances are, Suzie won't change, so you need to decide if you can live with it or not. But don't miss out on things while accommodating her.", "NAH- the only person who 'made' Suzie miss the movie is Suzie", "You didn't make Suzie miss the movie. Suzie made Suzie miss the movie. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \nShe has no respect for you. Stop inviting her when you go out.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and you should not have to accommodate her lateness all the time", "30 missed calls?  She expected you to answer them at the cinema?  Double rudeness on her part.", "That's not ADHD, at least not entirely. She may well have lost track of the time but once you called she should have started getting ready. If her ADHD is so bad that she got sidetracked that quickly and repeatedly in the space of your calls she needs help she's obviously not getting. That, or she doesn't put the effort in with her friends because she's been allowed to get away with it.", "Next time, invite the mother instead."]}
