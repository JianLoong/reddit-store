When making plans I asked her if the times were okay and if she would be able to leave at X time and that if she didn't I wouldn't wait for her and would just leave to watch the movie without her. \n\nFor context, suzie is always late. She has no care for other people's time. And I don't mean 10-20 minutes late. I mean she will be a whole 2 HOURS late. However, our other friends don't see it as annoying because \"it's just who she is\". Now I do understand that you can't change people. However, the amounts of times we have made bookings for a restaurant or arcade or bowling she has always made us late and we usually don't end up doing out plans that night. \n\nBack to the story:\nWhen we were planning to go out I had given a time 15 minutes earlier than what is ideal just so if she was late, we would still have time. Once again I had asked suzie if she was okay with the times and that I would leave after 15 minutes. She kept saying to stop being so uptight and that the time was perfect. The day arrives and I call her to let her know I am waiting for her. She says okay and said that she will be ready in 5 and be out in 10. 10 minutes passed and she wasn't out. I decided to call her again and she says that she will be out in 5 and that she just had to go to the bathroom. 5 minutes had passed again and I decided to call her mom and her mom told me that she was watching Netflix and wasn't even ready. After talking to her mom for 5 minutes, I decided to leave and watch the movie myself and put my phone on silent. \n\nAfter I had gotten home, I saw 30 missed calls and like 100 messages to berate me and ask why I didn't wait for her. I had reminded her that I informed her before that if I had waited 15 minutes and she wasn't out, I would leave. Now some of my friends are calling me an AH because she really wanted to watch this movie but I made her miss it and that if I really wanted to watch the movie with her I should have booked a later time.

Knowing she was outright lying to you about getting ready is also not fair to you.", "nta, Suzie needs some astronomy lessons cos the world ain\u2019t revolving around her.", "NTA - You gave her every opportunity to go with you, and told her what you would do if she wasn't on time. Good for you, sticking to what you said you would do. And just because your friends tolerate her BS doesn't mean that you should have to.", "Lol. NTA. I have a friend like this, but they would never blame someone for not waiting around for them. 30 missed calls and a 100 messages! That's not a very normal response to not getting your way. It really does sound like teenager drama - dont worry too much about it and move on if things dont work out with this friend.", "NTA sounds like your friend needs a wake up call on the real world.", "Nta, She better learn Young that she is not entitled to other people's time", "It's not the movie teather would wait until your friend show up.

She clearly has no care or respect for your time or feelings. She wasn't late because she was getting ready, she was sat watching TV, not caring that she was making you late. Stop making plans with her until she can be on time, start leaving her when she hadnt arrived by the arranged time, see how long it takes her to start getting there on time.", "NTA\n\nAnd feel free to dump this friend. She is inconsiderate, a liar, etc. There are more considerate people in the world.", "NTA. Your time is important too, and your friend is showing she doesn\u2019t respect that fact.", "NTA. Your friend group sounds like they\u2019re falling for the \u201cmissing stair\u201d fallacy. Imagine that a house has a staircase with a missing stair, it\u2019s always been like that so everyone just steps over the missing stair. It goes on like that for years, then one day a stranger comes into the house and says, \u201cHey, your staircase has a missing stair.

You don\u2019t have to walk up a staircase with a missing stair.", "Nta. Your friend group is ridiculous to brush off this behavior. It's incredibly rude and entitled. Some people are just late. If you accept and own that. You accept and own that there are consequences to being late. You don't get to ruin a whole group(or one persons) night because you don't vaule other peoples time. It also has to be mentioned that she was actively lying to you so she could watch Netflix. Giving you fake info and clearly inaccurate ETA.  That shows a disrespect deeper than just being bad at time management. That was intentional on her end to call your bluff and power play. Who needs those kind of friends?", "NTA. Why is it even a question. She was watching netflix ffs. She did this to herself. If she wanted to watch that movie she would be there with you on time. Your friends will learn this. Suzie won't if you keep letting her get away with disrespecting your time.", "NTA. She needs to learn how to respect other peoples time. I find it so rude when you make someone wait.

Dick move, Suzie.\n\nYour other friends are dead wrong. If you'd have made the plans for later, Suzie would have just done the same thing, only later. Movies start when they start, the theater doesn't hold them until you decide to show up.\n\nThe only way people like Suzie learn to respect others' time is by missing out. You did the right thing.

And she was lying to you about getting ready, I hope you have some other friends OP", "NTA. She needs to have a wakeup call. It's so rude to not respect other peoples' time. Doctors won't even see people who are more than 15 minutes late. You sound way more generous than me, I would've left at the 10 minute mark.", "NTA\n\nIt's absurd for anyone to expect that people they are supposedly friends with have to sit around with their thumbs up their ass for hours, waiting for said people to grace everyone with their presence.", "NTA. This reminds me of a \"friend\" who was consistently 1 to 2 hrs late to things, didn't reply to texts for weeks, and yet would lose it at me if I was (God forbid) 5 minutes late even if she wasn't ready. If she keeps this up, end the friendship.", "NTA. she doesn\u2019t respect your time so why should you wait for her? you communicated clearly to her that you would leave if she didn\u2019t show up after x minutes. it\u2019s her fault that she wasn\u2019t on time. i\u2019d understand being a bit late by 5 minutes if she was going to the bathroom, but she started watching netflix for some reason and wasn\u2019t even ready. that\u2019s just disrespectful.", "NTA. You didn't make her miss the movie. SHE made herself miss the movie. Did she expect the theatre to pause play until she got there? \n\nYour other friends are enabling her selfish attention seeking behaviour.", "NTA.\n\nIf she was legit only 5-10 minutes late and she was up there scrambling to get ready and get out the door, you\u2019d be an AH. But this person is chronically, disrespectfully late. And if you already bought tickets then she\u2019s not only wasting your time, but also the money you spent. \n\nDon\u2019t waste time on people who don\u2019t value you.", "Nta it's not teenager drama from your side, but it is from hers. Saying you're on the way when you're literally not even ready is such a dick move. At that point it stops being about timelines and starts being about straight up lying.", "NTA. Susie is extremely selfish and doesn\u2019t care about how much she inconveniences you. That\u2019s really hurtful. If your friends don\u2019t see that, they are ridiculous. You did nothing wrong. People do what you let them get away with. Stay firm.", "Your friends are rubes. If you\u2019d booked a later showing, she\u2019d have been late for that. \u201cWho she is\u201d is a rude liar. She doesn\u2019t care about your time or your plans and lied about being almost ready. She sucks and nobody should put up with that. She\u2019s the problem. Not letting her get away with the disrespect is not being the asshole here. NTA.", "NTA - No, we can't change other people but it doesn't mean we have to put up with things we aren't okay with. You gave her enough notice and she was just going on her own time anyway which is extremely selfish. Good job having the backbone to leave her ass home if she can't be on time.", "NTA. She\u2019s being inconsiderate and she knows it. I could understand if it was a minor inconvenience that made her a little late or she had informed you before but neither of those things happened. If seeing the movie was really that important to her she wouldn\u2019t be glued to Netflix ( it wouldn\u2019t be much better but at least more convenient if she was ready but just distracted. I\u2019ve done that a couple of time too). I have a cousin like this, and we\u2019ve just given up on waiting up for her all the time. She\u2019s 31 so much older than you or your friend but she\u2019s been this way her whole life. We usually just do whatever without her if she doesn\u2019t show up on time. At first she would get angry but once she owned up to it she accepted that sometimes she just wouldn\u2019t get to do certain things because she can\u2019t handle being on time for once in her life. The only time she\u2019s ever on time is Christmas Eve dinner because she hates being the last to get food due to our giant family\ud83d\ude02", "NTA and you should refuse to make time specific plans with her. Tell her we\u2019re all going to be at X place for X hours, we\u2019d love to have you if you can come and go about your life", "I hate when people make excuses of other peoples crappy behavior. She has no respect for your time. Susie\u2019s always going to think she\u2019s in the right and try and paint herself as the victim. Best to avoid these types of people. There\u2019s no winning. NTA", "NTA - you made your expectations clear, she fucked around and found out. \n\nBut I will say that if a friend of mine was like \"i'm leaving after 15 minutes if you're not here\" I wouldn't be friends with that person. It just feels like a parent berating a child. Why be friends with this person if their tardiness bothers you so much? She clearly is always late to everything, so you know this about her.

You're not required to sacrifice everything fun for her sake.\n\nIf this is a consistent issue, your friend might have ADD. Difficulty with conceptualizing time and being punctual are hallmarks of ADD. Does she have any other symptoms (disorganization, easily distracted, etc.)?", "NTA.  I am genuinely confused how she thought this was going to work.  The movie starts when it starts.  Was she expecting you to wait for her indefinitely and be late?  Or just not go at all?  Your friend group has taught her they will wait forever and if they have to cancel reservations/plans so be it.  You guys need to start telling her to meet you at the place and then if she shows up late she misses out.  Don\u2019t wait for her to go places, meet there, so her lateness only impacts her.  Eventually she\u2019ll learn to be on time or you\u2019ll stop inviting her.  Honestly it would be a kindness to her to stop working around her, she will be in for a very rude awakening when she finds out the rest of the world, including future jobs, won\u2019t wait for her.  Better she learn now.", "NTA. You are doing this exactly right. It\u2019s disturbing that other friends aren\u2019t backing you up on this, but if they want to continue to be disrespected by this girl, that\u2019s their problem. Honestly, if it was me, I would end this friendship. She\u2019s rude and selfish.", "NTA I just wouldn\u2019t do anything with her. She has no respect for you or your time. It\u2019s rude to constantly be late", "NTA for me, no chronically late person has ever been worth constantly waiting around for. If she were apologetic, I\u2019d say to never plans that require her presence at a specific time. Since she\u2019s a selfish AH, dump her as a friend.", "> her mom told me that she was watching Netflix and wasn't even ready. \n\nUnreal!

Wait till she gets a job and the boss just doesn't understand why she needs to be late every day!", "Nta, honestly she doesn't sound like a good friend. There's being bad with time management and then there's lying to your friend that you're getting ready when you're watching Netflix instead. She is showing you she values her time and not yours. I would either continue to give her hard times to be ready by or you're leaving, or maybe even better, drive separately. She probably asks for rides because she enjoys people waiting on her. Just meet there and she can miss whatever you have planned but you can enjoy it. Tbh though, I'd probably stop making plans with a person like this. Be friendly to them when you see them and have more of an acquaintance relationship. Don't go do something with people who don't respect you.", "NTA. The movie wouldn\u2019t wait for her to start, either you both miss it or just she misses it. Consequences are the only way to train \u201clate people\u201d. Letting them get away with being late just confirms they have the power to show up whenever and people will cater to them.", "NTA. If others are ok with her always being late that is their business. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to. And clearly she didn\u2019t want to watch the movie that badly if she was watching Netflix when she was already late.  Susie sounds like one of those people who thinks her time is more valuable than everyone else\u2019s. This probably won\u2019t be the first time she has something like this happen so she better work on her time management", "NTA, I wouldn't pick her up for stuff anymore. Let her make her own way over whenever she is ready. If you even want to continue the friendship tbh.\n\n(Also Suzume was great, I hope you enjoyed it ! Half of our party didn't show up too so we had space to spread out haha)", "NTA\nShe was watching netflix?? That's not just \"oh i don't know where the time went\" That's not giving a f.\nAnd she gets away with it, 'cause that is \"who she is\"\nSo no.

That analogy is so good", "Tbh my friend group is pretty split. It's like 70/30. 70 for me 30 for her. I guess my friends are starting to realise that she is wrong.

It's 1. Rude 2. Shows lack of discipline and integrity 3. Selfish 4. Inability to be dependable. It's gonna be a hard life for this young woman if she doesn't change asap. \n\nGood job Friends' mom. Hopefully her example will eventually rub off onto her daughter.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the movie!!!", "way to go for still watching the movie!", "It would have been funny if she showed up literally after the movie was done and you saw her as you were walking out.

Not saying you should break off the friendship, but understand that just because it would be \u201cweird not to\u201d is not exactly a good reason.", "I am pretty sure she's just tired of all the phone calls asking if her daughter is okay because she's so late", "It was a beautiful movie.
