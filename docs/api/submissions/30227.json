Expecting others to interpret hints or to offer to take over the planning without a straightforward conversation is unrealistic and can lead to misunderstandings, as it did in this situation.\n\n  \nHer being upset and having an outburst is also not acceptable. While pregnancy can indeed be an emotionally turbulent time, it doesn't excuse poor behaviour or the imposition of unspoken expectations on others. It's important for boundaries to be respected and for communication to be clear, especially in close family relationships.\n\n  \nGiven the circumstances, you're under no obligation to throw her a baby shower now, especially not under the pressure of an outburst.

She knows it still looks bad from an etiquette and social norm perspective to throw your own shower plus she doesn\u2019t want to do the labor or spend the money. However given she has complained about every single event you and your mom have thrown for her plus has repeatedly said she wants to do it herself you and your mom don\u2019t owe her a damn thing.

Be an adult and be direct about what you want \ud83d\ude44 also, nothing wrong with planning your baby shower, I did it for my two because I hate bothering ppl with things.

Sure, hormones play a part, but the world doesn't start revolving around you just because you are reproducing. Your sister needs to realize this. You and your mom are not mind-readers.

Be careful I bet she\u2019s going to be even more entitled as a mom.", "Was seriously expecting to not come down on this side, but NTA. You aren't mind readers.  Communication is key.  If she is someone who has complained about parties you had thrown for her in the past, and then started saying that she will throw her own shower, well, why wouldn't you believe that is what she preferred?", "NTA I am like your sister. I have high expectations and I have had an extremely hard time getting pregnant a second time. In my imagination my sister, SIL and MIL become different people and would offer to throw me a shower. I would be a little bummed that they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nBut I\u2019d still be the asshole. People do not read minds and they don\u2019t magically transform into mini me\u2019s because I want them to. She\u2019s probably very hormonal and has built this up for years but it\u2019s not reality.", "NTA but I feel like this is a no-win situation. People get real AH-y over the \"etiquette\" around these kinds of things. Not supposed to throw your own shower because it's \"gift grabby\" (uhhh that's the point of the shower...). Oh, but your female relatives ALSO can't throw you a shower in some places because you're \"too close\" to the mom-to-be so that is also \"gift grabby.\" So it's gotta be someone close, but not TOO close, but not related, but also not at too much distance that makes it seem weird. And in some places you can't ask, because that's rude, so then you have to hope that this very specific close, but not too close, unrelated, female person will just KNOW to throw you a baby shower.\n\nI threw my own baby shower because I wanted certain things and I don't like asking people for stuff. It hurt a little that no one even offered to throw one (I also went through fertility treatment), but whatever. There were ways she could have just asked ffs.", "NTA because you can\u2019t read her mind. \n\nBut, I think throwing your own shower is really tacky.  Can you and your mom offer to be the official hostesses - handle invites, etc. but let her take the lead on all the extravagant things she wants?", "NTA but I\u2019ve been in the position where no one offered to throw me a baby shower and it kinda sucks. I do remember kind of hinting to my mom and sister about it - this was during Covid so my plan was to do a \u2018shower by mail\u2019 which is kinda lame but it\u2019s where you send cards out basically saying \u2018*name* is pregnant, here\u2019s where you can send a card or gifts and here\u2019s where she\u2019s registered\u2019. My sister ended up offering to help with that but because she used our return address for the envelopes it ended up looking like we sent them out ourselves anyway (and then it felt even more tacky). \n\nSo yeah, NTA, but it would be a nice thing to do to just say \u2018oh I\u2019m sorry I really thought you didn\u2019t want our help, but we\u2019d be happy to plan it!\u2019", "NTA. The mother-to-be and her immediate family would never be hosts for a baby shower at all, from an old-school etiquette perspective.  Shower hosts would be friends, in-laws, other relatives, etc. \n\nThese days I guess it's not seen as a faux pas, so you understandably took her at her word.  All good.", "Unless this is typical of her communication style, NTA.  If it is typical, maybe you should have picked up on it.", "NTA", "NTA.  I respond - You didn't like the other parties we planned for you and all you did was complain so I was following your lead on this.", "Nope NTA", "NTA you aren\u2019t mind readers, if someone says they are going to do something I accept that\u2019s the plan", "NTA. You & your mom aren't mind readers. You took her words at face value, so her being butthurt about this situation is completely her fault. Since you have prior experience with her picky behavior, taking her word for it was reasonable. Besides, she would have complained about whatever you'd planned anyway. Just like before.", "peoppe need to stop with the double meaning bs and just say what they mean NTA", "NTA. This is stupid. I have always hated this idea that just because I\u2019m a woman of a certain age where those around me are having babies & getting married that I should be a capable party planner. The parties I\u2019ve planned have been fine but not in proportion to the work, stress & anxiety of the whole thing. That\u2019s why there are people for that. ESPECIALLY if someone wants some elaborate production of a baby shower. Your sister is 31 not 21. There\u2019s not much excuse. She\u2019s alienating her support system when she is about to need them the most. \n\nI\u2019m curious if this is pretty standard for her or if this is unprecedented behavior. She could have initially thought that she could  easily and happily plan the shower, then as her pregnancy progressed she became overwhelmed by the idea and just had a bad day and found something & someone to aim her anger & frustration at. For someone who has always been effortlessly healthy and even, pregnancy can really throw you for a loop if you\u2019ve generally always been able to predict & manage emotions easily. If this is out of character, I might try to emphasize your support in whatever way she needs it but that you might need her to direct you where she needs that support. She may just need reassurance from the women in her life. \n\nIf this is just her normal MO, I would just live my life & not worry about it. She might never be happy with what you do.", "NTA isn't it bad etiquette though to throw a baby shower for yourself?", "NTA. Your sister didn\u2019t effectively specify what she wanted.
