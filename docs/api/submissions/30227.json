I think she was the a-hole for the way she went about it, but then again, it is not traditional for someone to throw their own baby shower and typically someone close to the mother does offer to throw it, so maybe we really are the a-holes.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Tradition be damned. \n\nAnd go to the choosingbeggars subreddit, I bet you will see some familiar things.

You did not offer to throw the party when she repeatedly said she would which made her angry. But if you had thrown her the party she would have bitched that it wasn't perfect, as she's done in the past.", "NTA\n\nWhy can't people just say what they want ?!", "NTA: You are in a no-win situation. If you had offered and she accepted you would have thrown a lovely party she would have hated. You listened to her words and didn't offer to throw one and she's mad.\n\nShe deserves a little grace though because she is just raging with hormones right now.", "NTA. Unless you live in Opposite Land there was no way you could be expected to manage her convoluted logic.", "NTA. People need to realise that they should say what they *mean* and not expect others to *interpret* their literal words. \n\nI'd have thought maybe your sister's tone could have given you a hint that she actually just said that in the hopes of you and your mum jumping in. But then you said she usually isn't satisfied with the parties thrown for her, so why would she expect you to offer anyways?", "NTA. Her passive-aggressive nonsense is childish. Parenthood is going to kick her ass.", "Uh NTA. Honestly, considering past history with parties, I'm shocked that she would even attempt to 'hint' around. That isn't even an acceptable hint, I too would have taken it at face value. \n\nCould you possibly appease her by you and your mother telling her that you would chip in toward a party planner?  Make sure you set a firm limit on the budget with the party planner though, she sounds like the type plan a 50K party and leave you on the hook for it.", "NTA. She played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.", "NTA. You're not responsible for her expectations and fantasies.", "NTA\n\nAlways critical of others efforts to throw parties because she is the always upset how others plan things.  She says she is going to plan an extravagant baby shower which was probably a relief to you and your mother.  Who wants to go to the effort of throwing someone a party and then being picked at for your deficiencies.  I bet she has no self awareness about her behavior and maybe this is the teaching moment.... but I doubt it.", "NTA if she\u2019s hypercritical of the parties you plan and said she was planning her own she can\u2019t fault you for not having ESP. Tell her what you said here; you\u2019ll plan if there aren\u2019t complaints about her lofty expectations not being met i.e. if she\u2019s grateful.", "NTA unless you\u2019re a well known family of psychics. \n\nBut pregnancy can be a minefield of hormones at the best of times. Throw in fertility treatment I\u2019d be cutting her some slack unless this is normal behaviour from her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
