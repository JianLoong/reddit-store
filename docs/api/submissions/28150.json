If your older daughter usually acts like this, you wouldn't be shocked enough to post about it.  So, something is pissing her off and despite your answers in the comments, I highly doubt all she said was \"I'm mad she's going to the same school as me,\" without any other reason or context about their relationship or *what exactly* would happen if her sister goes to the same school. \n\n\nMaybe the older daughter is lying about herself and the sisters presence will complicate matters.  Maybe she finally feels like she can become her own person after life with the golden child.

There's obviously some background you're not disclosing and it's hard to give an honest vote without that information.\n\nIf the bad blood were mutual I don't know why your youngest would call her sister with the good news.   If there was not bad blood, I don't know why your oldest would be upset.", "how big is the school?  is it a large university or all college?\n\nAt a large Uni, siblings can both attend and never run into each other.  At a smaller school, they could be seeing each other a lot.\n\nYou are correct that no now \"owns\" the college.\n\nHow well did the get along when they lived together?\n\nNTA", "I feel like details are missing here. What were the reasons your older kid gave for not wanting the younger one there? Has the younger one always outshined her in life? Maybe she\u2019s jealous and wanted to feel like she had a safe space from you. \n\nI agree she doesn\u2019t own the college, but I just feel like there\u2019s more going on here that you\u2019re leaving out.", "INFO: Different question than others had. How much longer does your oldest have in school before graduating? ie. how long will the two be overlapping on campus?\n\nIf your oldest is in her last year and the overlap would be one semester, it would be a very different situation from two or three years on campus at the same time.", "Info: will they be expected to live together?", "Since there isn't enough detail and it could be anyone's guess, I'm going with oldest daughter has some secret in regards to her college life and younger sister being on the scene will cause it to get back to her parents.", "Info - this story makes no sense. Why is anyone upset about this?", "NTA - are you sure the oldest is even still in college? Lol maybe she just found out she's about to be busted and is freaking out. \n\nKind of an over the top reaction just cause sibling is going there. Unless sister ALWAYS tagged along with everything big sis did and then I could kind of see it.", "ETA - Sort of.  \n\n\nFor a lot of kids, going to college is about getting away from your family and the life at home.  And now having her little sister there takes away some of your oldest's identity.  \n\n\nWhen I went to college, I specifically applied to one that NO ONe from my HS had been to in 4 years.  When I was a junior, I encountered a freshman who was from my hometown.  They asked if I wanted to meet up and I explained to her that I came to the college to get away from everyone abck home and tat I would prefer if we didn't get together.  She was a little confused, but accepted it and we never spoke again.  \n\n\nYou and your youngest should ahve discussed her applying at the oldest's college before applying.  \n\n\nDoes the oldest have the right to ban her?  No.  \n\n\nIs she justified in not wanting her there?  Definitely.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut why would you pretend for it to be \"good\" news. It might be, for the youngest, but not for her sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause you sound like an AH who would try to push the younger at the older and try to make the kid her responsibility.", "Is there a lot of back story that we aren\u2019t getting?", "This post is reeking of \"I don't want to actually share the reasons my oldest doesn't like this because I know that she has a good reason.\"\n\nI'm guessing golden child, or parentification, or both.", "NTA.\n\nI agree that the younger daughter should go where she wants to go.\n\nI don't think it is constructive though to dismiss the older one and tell her she is \"petty\". I think it would be good to hear nonjudgmentally what her concerns are. \n\nListening nonjudgmentally goes a long way.", "Your oldest child is the AH. Is she jealous of her younger sibling maybe. She cannot dictate where her younger sibling gets her education. I'm sure it's a big enough college that they don't have to interact???", "NTA and either is youngest.\n\nThere are usually 10s of thousands of people at the college.  No reason for your oldest  to be that dramatic.  She's probably partying a lot and doesn't want to be tattled on, but she's in college and should party a little", "NTA\n\nYour oldest is probably doing stuff she doesn't want you to know about and is upset her younger sister can now rat her out. Just a guess, but that's the only thing that makes sense to why she'd be upset.", "NTA.  I'd like to hear your older daughter's reasons why she doesn't want her younger sister attending the same college as her.  Your older daughter is entitled to her thoughts on this, but her rude treatment of your younger daughter and you is totally unacceptable.  Is she feeling she'd be responsible for her sister or something else that is objectionable to her? Do the girls in general not get along?", "NTA. Big sis seems entirely irrational. Didn't they go to the same pre-college schools?  Why should this matter? You need to ask big sis why, specifically, little sis should not go to this college.", "NTA. Big sis is probably up to shenanigans and doesn't want any witnesses to report back home. If there is a couple year grade difference between the girls, it is highly unlikely they would ever be in the same class. She's just assuming that little sis is going to follow her around and cramp her style. I'm all about following the scholarship, so big sis can just suck it up.", "Nta but your daughter is a self-centered immature ashole.  You raised her tjis way.  Your job to get her some therapy for her narcissist behavior.  She needs to learn the world does not revolve around her. If you are allowing her to send you nasty text you are a huge part of the problem. At your age do you not know how to set boundaries. At her age have you not taught her decent manners and behavior.

How big is the school? Are they going to be in the same or similar programs? Are you expecting them to live together at any point? \n\nI hesitate to give a judgement because there's a lot your daughter could be upset about that's completely valid to be upset about. \n\nFor instance, my roommate for 3 years during undergrad was extremely upset when her younger sister decided to attend the same college as us because their parents expected her to live on campus with her younger sister, which it's completely reasonable to be upset about imo!", "That the youngest is going to her college", "It\u2019s not huge but it\u2019s not small either.

This sounds like missing missing reasons and you avoided that question", "That is a TINY school. 75 people per class??? I had 100 times that amount in high school! Edit: college, not HS. \n\nThat number makes a big difference. There goes any chance at anonymity she had.\n\nNo, your elder daughter doesn't own the school, but I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't feel some type of way about it if I were her. It kinda seems like the only way for eldest to get away from youngest is to keep running because you didnt teach your younger kid boundaries. \n\nNAH, but also leaning towards YTA bc I feel like your oldest daughter is stuck now, and you don't seem to care about that at all.", "lol when he says 75 per class I believe he means \"in the classroom\" not \"in the graduating class\"", "My undergraduate class was about 11,000 people\u2026", "Tell the oldest daughter,  that if she gives the younger daughter the money she would have received for the scholarship, you will get her to go to another university.", "That is a very small school for college.", "I had 75 people in my major alone, and I went to what I would consider a \"small college\", we had a total undergrad of about 1500. \n\n75 in each class is 300 kids. Most high schools have more than that.... that's a really small school", "Ah.  Still, NTA.", "Agreed.\n\nDid op rent his daughter a place to live near the college.

Unless the little sister is a known bully to her sister her something, she is literally just making drama.", "Agreed, but that\u2019s also a really weird way to state it.  My college\u2019s total undergrad size was almost 40,000 people and I had classes that ranged from 200 students to 10 students.", "Eh, could be, but I've never heard it used that way outside of elementary school. \n\n75 in a lecture hall is also really small. My college standard lecture hall accommodates 300. Smaller classrooms for up to 75 students do exist, but those are regular classrooms, not lecture halls.", "It's a state school, are there any state schools with 300 students in a 4 year college? Maybe it's a typo for 750?", "Not in a single classroom, no. \n\nYou're right though I was off by a factor of 10 for the highschool number. 750 ish in my HS graduating class. Freshman class was closer to 1200. \n\n7500 is about the right number for my college graduating class though. 30k students total.", "I'm not calling the little sister the AH; she's in the clear afaic.\n\nI think OP is TA for not hearing out his elder daughter. I am an eldest child, and have often been on the receiving end of copycat syndrome. It is not flattering, it creates anxiety because it activates a flight response - when someone chases you, you run. If they keep doing it against your wishes, you don't feel safe until they are gone. That instinct applies to figurative chasing as well. \n\nLike, yes, lil sis is allowed to go to the same school. But out of all the schools, she has to choose the exact same tiny ass college as the eldest? Why? I would understand more if it was a giant, flagship state school with tons of majors and scholarships. Also, if there has been other copying in the past, this will sting more.\n\nEven though little sis is in the clear, this creates a problem for the eldest. Now she has to do all this work to avoid her sister in a <500 person school it sounds like. This would grate, especially since eldest was there first. Does she need to transfer now in order to feel free? OP should at least show sympathy and support in finding another solution, instead of just \"you're being immature, suck it up.\" \n\nEldest children don't always mature faster than their younger siblings, and it is pretty damaging to always tell them they have to be more mature. They often don't get raised the way their younger sibs are, just get shamed into pretending they're more mature than they really are. This lack of nurturing shows up when they're older. \n\nOP seems like he cares more about making his life easy than his elder daughter's life happy. Like how hard is it to just have a conversation and express sympathy?", "That depends on the school. All my classes were 25 people max. I think about 500 people in my graduating class. It was a small school but there were so many people I never encountered, siblings could easily live totally separate lives at that school.", "Yea, my school had a dedicated building for large  lecturer halls. It had like 2 max capacity of 500 and one 1000, Like literally with wing and mezzanine seating, but like the school 30 mins south of it could fit the entire student body in one of those lecture halls.", "She might have chosen that school because it was the only one who gave her a scholarship.  University is expensive and every little bit helps.", "Right?  My guess is that OPs oldest just wants some  independance and distance.  Now shes going to have little sis hanging around and likely OP is going to tell her to take care of sister and make sure shes ok etc, show her around!   I hope OP doesnt expect them to room together etc.  Honestly I'd be upset too.", "I donno, 500 is not that large of a number.\n\nI was in a 400 person program in my highschool. Even though we didn't all know each other personally, we knew of everyone else in the program. Everyone knew if anyone's sibling was also in the program, even if the siblings had totally separate friend groups. Teachers still made comparisons, and so did other students.", "Yep, we had a few of those max capacity rooms too. Anything bigger than that, we had the basketball stadium. Needed this anytime we had a semi-famous guest seminar.  The stadium was used for graduation as well. \n\nThe smaller satellite schools definitely felt more like high school than college, due to the small class sizes.", "Definitely, I'm not saying little sister is definitely motivated by copying elder, and nothing else. I don't think your scenario is likely though, since smaller schools tend to have fewer scholarships. Possible, just not likely. However, maybe they're a special program there that enticed both daughters. There is no reason for us to ascribe ill intention to the younger sister. We don't know the history; OP does though. \n\nIf I were elder daughter, it would comfort me to know that sister chose college because of a scholarship, program, etc. not because she wants to copy. It would probably be easier to swallow the message from a parent rather than the offending sibling. \n\nIf the sister is copying, it would comfort me to have my parents acknowledge that. \"Yes, she seems like she is following you, yes it might be annoying, unfortunately you're both adults so we can't control the situation. How do you want to handle it going forward?\" would probably go a long way towards deescalating the situation. \n\nEither way, I think it's OP's job to discuss this with elder daughter instead of just telling her her feelings aren't valid.", "I didn\u2019t say it was large, it was a small school which i literally said. And there were still tons of people I never interacted with because they were in totally different fields and not a part of my extended friend group.", "Wow, it\u2019s just hitting me how big my school was, we had to use our football stadium for university wide graduation and either the dedicated guest theatre or the basketball stadium for our school/degree specific graduations, and this was like a Midwest state school. It was pretty funny too cuz most the students had maybe a 100 person graduating class, they couldn\u2019t comprehend I graduated with 572 other students while still keeping it under an hour runtime.", "In OPs post OP said they offered her a really good scholarship.  So since the school offered it to her, it should be a big factor in picking a school.", "Ok, I mean I don't know what you mean by large and small. I thought OP's description of 75ppl/class = maximum 500 students at the school. \n\nSo I compared it to a 400 person program I have experience with, because I thought the numbers are close enough to compare. I could be wrong about that, but I feel like if the program was 5 years instead of 4, I still would have at least known of everyone. Wouldn't interact with them all, but could recognize by face/name. \n\nThat's still enough awareness that people would know if you had a sibling in the same school, unless you had a really common last name or something.", "They kept you to under an hour??? That's amazing! Mine was like 4 hours long. My entire family fell asleep. \n\nI mostly got through it because my friend who sat next to me brought snacks and a notebook so we could play games discreetly lol. \n\nWe both had graduation anxiety because we also graduated HS together. That graduation was like 6 hours long. I have no idea why, I think I just blocked out all the details of that day.", "I missed that on my first pass, thanks for pointing it out. I wonder if the elder daughter knows about the scholarship, or if that got lost in the arguing.", "Yeah my high school knew what they were doing lol even said that \u201cwe know you guys don\u2019t care about the other parents kids\u201d and just had like the principal speak, 2 student speakers, and then 2 teachers just went rapid fire reading the names."]}
