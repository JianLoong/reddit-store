Big sis is probably up to shenanigans and doesn't want any witnesses to report back home.

My college standard lecture hall accommodates 300. Smaller classrooms for up to 75 students do exist, but those are regular classrooms, not lecture halls.", "It's a state school, are there any state schools with 300 students in a 4 year college?

Freshman class was closer to 1200. \n\n7500 is about the right number for my college graduating class though. 30k students total.", "I'm not calling the little sister the AH; she's in the clear afaic.\n\nI think OP is TA for not hearing out his elder daughter. I am an eldest child, and have often been on the receiving end of copycat syndrome. It is not flattering, it creates anxiety because it activates a flight response - when someone chases you, you run. If they keep doing it against your wishes, you don't feel safe until they are gone. That instinct applies to figurative chasing as well. \n\nLike, yes, lil sis is allowed to go to the same school. But out of all the schools, she has to choose the exact same tiny ass college as the eldest? Why? I would understand more if it was a giant, flagship state school with tons of majors and scholarships. Also, if there has been other copying in the past, this will sting more.\n\nEven though little sis is in the clear, this creates a problem for the eldest. Now she has to do all this work to avoid her sister in a <500 person school it sounds like. This would grate, especially since eldest was there first. Does she need to transfer now in order to feel free? OP should at least show sympathy and support in finding another solution, instead of just \"you're being immature, suck it up.\" \n\nEldest children don't always mature faster than their younger siblings, and it is pretty damaging to always tell them they have to be more mature. They often don't get raised the way their younger sibs are, just get shamed into pretending they're more mature than they really are. This lack of nurturing shows up when they're older. \n\nOP seems like he cares more about making his life easy than his elder daughter's life happy. Like how hard is it to just have a conversation and express sympathy?", "That depends on the school. All my classes were 25 people max. I think about 500 people in my graduating class. It was a small school but there were so many people I never encountered, siblings could easily live totally separate lives at that school.", "Yea, my school had a dedicated building for large  lecturer halls. It had like 2 max capacity of 500 and one 1000, Like literally with wing and mezzanine seating, but like the school 30 mins south of it could fit the entire student body in one of those lecture halls.", "She might have chosen that school because it was the only one who gave her a scholarship.  University is expensive and every little bit helps.", "Right?  My guess is that OPs oldest just wants some  independance and distance.  Now shes going to have little sis hanging around and likely OP is going to tell her to take care of sister and make sure shes ok etc, show her around!   I hope OP doesnt expect them to room together etc.  Honestly I'd be upset too.", "I donno, 500 is not that large of a number.\n\nI was in a 400 person program in my highschool. Even though we didn't all know each other personally, we knew of everyone else in the program. Everyone knew if anyone's sibling was also in the program, even if the siblings had totally separate friend groups. Teachers still made comparisons, and so did other students.", "Yep, we had a few of those max capacity rooms too. Anything bigger than that, we had the basketball stadium. Needed this anytime we had a semi-famous guest seminar.  The stadium was used for graduation as well. \n\nThe smaller satellite schools definitely felt more like high school than college, due to the small class sizes.", "Definitely, I'm not saying little sister is definitely motivated by copying elder, and nothing else. I don't think your scenario is likely though, since smaller schools tend to have fewer scholarships. Possible, just not likely. However, maybe they're a special program there that enticed both daughters. There is no reason for us to ascribe ill intention to the younger sister. We don't know the history; OP does though. \n\nIf I were elder daughter, it would comfort me to know that sister chose college because of a scholarship, program, etc. not because she wants to copy. It would probably be easier to swallow the message from a parent rather than the offending sibling. \n\nIf the sister is copying, it would comfort me to have my parents acknowledge that. \"Yes, she seems like she is following you, yes it might be annoying, unfortunately you're both adults so we can't control the situation. How do you want to handle it going forward?\" would probably go a long way towards deescalating the situation. \n\nEither way, I think it's OP's job to discuss this with elder daughter instead of just telling her her feelings aren't valid.", "I didn\u2019t say it was large, it was a small school which i literally said. And there were still tons of people I never interacted with because they were in totally different fields and not a part of my extended friend group.", "Wow, it\u2019s just hitting me how big my school was, we had to use our football stadium for university wide graduation and either the dedicated guest theatre or the basketball stadium for our school/degree specific graduations, and this was like a Midwest state school. It was pretty funny too cuz most the students had maybe a 100 person graduating class, they couldn\u2019t comprehend I graduated with 572 other students while still keeping it under an hour runtime.", "In OPs post OP said they offered her a really good scholarship.  So since the school offered it to her, it should be a big factor in picking a school.", "Ok, I mean I don't know what you mean by large and small. I thought OP's description of 75ppl/class = maximum 500 students at the school. \n\nSo I compared it to a 400 person program I have experience with, because I thought the numbers are close enough to compare. I could be wrong about that, but I feel like if the program was 5 years instead of 4, I still would have at least known of everyone. Wouldn't interact with them all, but could recognize by face/name. \n\nThat's still enough awareness that people would know if you had a sibling in the same school, unless you had a really common last name or something.", "They kept you to under an hour??? That's amazing! Mine was like 4 hours long. My entire family fell asleep. \n\nI mostly got through it because my friend who sat next to me brought snacks and a notebook so we could play games discreetly lol. \n\nWe both had graduation anxiety because we also graduated HS together. That graduation was like 6 hours long. I have no idea why, I think I just blocked out all the details of that day.", "I missed that on my first pass, thanks for pointing it out. I wonder if the elder daughter knows about the scholarship, or if that got lost in the arguing.", "Yeah my high school knew what they were doing lol even said that \u201cwe know you guys don\u2019t care about the other parents kids\u201d and just had like the principal speak, 2 student speakers, and then 2 teachers just went rapid fire reading the names.", "YTA for ignoring the INFO requests.", "hashtag ... missingmissingreasons\n\nINFO: Why did your oldest freak out over her sister attending the same college?", "NTA.

My parents were and are great about treating us all like individuals, but I totally understand wanting something that is \u201cjust yours,\u201d especially something as life-changing as college. Your college becomes a huge part of your identity when you\u2019re attending (and may remain so after), and I see where the sister could feel like some of that is being stolen.", "I was wondering this, too.  I was the younger sibling in this situation back when it was my turn to go to college--I would either be going to my older sister's college or my older brother's, because those were the two best schools I'd gotten into.  Luckily for me I get along well with my siblings!  I went to my sister's school and we did the same major and even had the same part-time job on campus, and I'm really lucky she never gave me a hard time for it.  In fact, we both had a great time, and even though the school was fairly small we didn't feel like we were glued together at the hip or couldn't have separate friend groups.    \n\n\nBut that's because we both wanted it that way.  I can 100% see where this would be difficult if you were an older sister to a younger sister golden child, or you lived a life growing up where she always had to be allowed to wear your clothes and play with your friends and you couldn't go to a party unless she was invited, etc etc.  So we need some more info on what the sisters' relationship is!", "Having had a younger sister who was the golden child (but thankfully not smart or motivated enough to get into the schools that I got into and attended), she would totally do something like call me with the \"good news\" just so she could rub it in, gloat, and be able to act all sad and confused when I didn't react with joy, sunshine, and rainbows. \n\nI truly feel for the oldest. College was probably the first time something was completely all hers, where she didn't have to deal with a younger sister who would intrude on her friendships, report her activities back to her parents, tell embarrassing stories about the older sister, etc. Where she could basically just breathe, and just *be.* So she lets her guard down, starts to see that she is truly free of her family (breaking free of those sorts of dynamics is a long process) and begins to become her own person without any intrusion, and build a life, and then BAM! \n\nGolden child will probably get lavished with all kinds of gifts and perks that the oldest didn't get, and with two kids there, the parents might visit way more often. At this point, its not like the older sister can just easily transfer out. Sure she doesn't \"own\" the college, but damn, what a blow, and during such vulnerable years.", "Yeah I wonder if younger sister has a habit of being a copycat, clingy, etc. So it may be the last straw for older sister even if older sister seems possessive in this particular case", "I didn't think of that angle. If the younger was always indulged, never punished or forced to take accountability, she might get into the partying or other trouble and older sis will be expected to drop everything she's doing to go pick her up, bail her out, and so on, and if she doesn't the parents might retaliate in some way. \n\nI think its disingenuous for OP and the younger sis to act like its \"good news\". I mean, if the two truly were close enough that attending the same school would be \"good news\", the older sis would've known she was applying in the first place and not been blindsided.", "Same here. Same school as my brother. Saw each other now and again. Different friends. Different dorms. No big deal.", "YTA here as well. I've seen it, AND lived it. If my sister would've been able to get into my school, she totally would've done something like this, right down to the phone call with the \"good news\". \n\nMy school experience wasn't great and the last part of it was marred by an abusive relationship that I had to escape alone. Sadly, I would've preferred that-and all of the fallout-over having my sister at my school.", "Pre-college schools and college are in no way comparable. In pre-college schools, the school grades are pretty rigorously segregated and with the age differences and the grade groupings (separate schools for K-3, 4-6, 7-8 and HS), it would be entirely possible for them not to have crossed paths for their entire school experience. Not to mention, they're both living at home and the parents can intervene, impose consequences, and there's not a lot of room for any autonomy like one gets in college. College, for a lot of people, is a time to break free and become their own person without coercion or pressure to perform a different kind of role. Usually the only way they got through those younger years was the hope of college and its promise of freedom. Finally older sis was able to carve a life out that was hers and hers alone and that she could live without surveillance or judgment, maybe she even came out or rejected the religion she'd grown up with. College and all its supports and benefits might've been what she needed to break free of the poisonous family dynamic and its roles and what she needed to do to survive. Now her safety is gone.", "Youngest of 4, and I intentionally chose a school that nobody else in my family went to. Granted, only one older actually went to college, but that was the one university the entire family were diehard fans of even though none of them had ever been enrolled there before that sibling went. So naturally, I chose the rival school out of an abundance of rebellion/spite. If necessary I would have gone across the country just to be the first and only one at my school.", "Maybe, but my brother and I overlapped for one year in college (I was a senior when he was a freshman), and we attended the same, quite small, university. And you know what? Even though I had friends who were in his year, and he had friends who were in my year \u2013 and even though the total student body back then numbered about 1,200 \u2013 we only crossed paths when we actively wanted to do so. I literally never saw him, not even in passing, not even in the dining hall (there's only one) at peak meal times, except for the handful of times he called me for something. If my brother and I never encountered each other at a very small school in a rural area, OP's older daughter can easily avoid her sister if she wants to.", "Sorry you had to go through with that. I hope your life is awesome now.", "It just feels off that the post doesn't include a deeper discussion of OP asking why his daughter feels this way. If a loved one blew up at me, I wouldn't be posting to reddit before asking them *why* they're so mad.  \n\nThis has all the hallmarks of OP being told what the issue is and simply disregarding it.", "You're purposely withholding relevant information here, which makes it very difficult to give proper judgment. On its surface, you wrote this post in a way that makes it clear you want to be declared not the asshole. But given that you are neglecting to reply to people's requests for more clarifying information, and that you called a university of less than 500 students not small (that's tiny!) it makes me think you know that if you revealed more information, then you would be called an asshole. So, YTA.", "Ok but WHY", "She must have some reason. A good reason, a bad reason, there is *some reason* she is upset that her sister got into the same college she attends. And I am absolutely certain that at some point before calling you a jerk, she told you what that reason was.", "Info: Why dont they get along? \n\nWas there a fight? Is younger sister the golden child? We need more info. \n\nAnd if you dont provide the proper context, then your admitting your the AH.", "Honestly, if it's a small state school, I could see why the older daughter is annoyed. It sounds like you didn't even try to talk it out with her to figure out exactly why she feels that way and just shut her feelings down. But chances are, they won't have any classes together anyway and can just act like they don't know each other if that's why she doesn't want the younger daughter to go to the same college", "OP getting downvoted for answering a question on class sizes is peak AITA.", "I had more kids than that entire school in any single year at high school. I had more kids than that entire school than in any single year at my *middle school*.", "Excellent explanation. Thanks!", "Provided the younger daughter doesn\u2019t go out of her way to make that difficult. If either of you had been actively trying to pester the other one you would have seen a very different picture in your own life.", "or he simply doesn't know because the older daughter is not sharing the right information.\n\nWhy do people here ALWAYS assume the worst? Like always write up pages of fanfic-worthy material just to turn the story around?", "Seriously, I've seen this exact scenario twice in my family/friends. A kid was expecting a certain level of independence, individuality, and privacy. When a sibling goes to the same school they feel robbed. It's not necessarily a reasonable feeling, but it happens now and then. \n\nIt doesn't have to make sense. Sometimes people get weirdly territorial.", "That is not a tiny school? I went to a state school and non-lecture hall courses all had about 30-50 people in it.", "75 period per class is not tiny. I go to a university with over 30,000 students and I\u2019ve never had more than 40 people in my classes", "how is it excellent? it was basically just a fanfic. Nothing that Magpie wrote was based on fact of the events in the story, just made-up stuff on the spot.", "\\>or he simply doesn't know because the older daughter is not sharing the right information.  \nOP should reply saying that then.\n\n\\>Why do people here ALWAYS assume the worst?  \nIn this case it's because the OP is purposely leaving out information, and refusing to clarify.", "\"Class\" can mean \"all the people in a graduating class\" or \"all the people in one particular course in a given room at a given time.\" Every individual course is going to be different; I've had classes of 200 and classes of 8. They probably mean graduating class.", "They\u2019re using \u201cclass\u201d as the entire graduating school year. Not as in classroom number. So it is a really small school", "I'm reading \"class\" as \"the entire year\". That means there's less than 200 students in the entire college.", "It's the one plausible (and even likely) explanation for why she doesn't want her sister in the same college but refuses to articulate a reason.\n\nOp doesn't know it, so of course it wouldn't appear in the post. Big sis isn't about to tell mom that reason.\n\nBy calling it fanfic, it would appear that you have a better, reality-based explanation. What is it? (and BTW: which fandom does Magpie use?)", "Makes a lot more sense than a  college with 600-students."]}
