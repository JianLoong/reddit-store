Do not let this disgusting pig see your child unless there is a court order because I have heard way too many stories of the husband and stepmom fighting to get rid of the birth mom and raise the child as solely theirs.

I'm guessing you're not in the US, so I don't know your laws, but I assume just about everywhere parental rights and visitation is dependent on child support.  In the US, that includes paying for the pregnancy (at least in some states, source: my brother had to pay half the HC costs of the pregnancy to see his son). Unless he offers you a massive chunk of money every month, you're probably better off taking him to court.", "NTA. He can't decide if he's in or out. If he goes through the effort of going to court, that's some modicum of proof that he's in it for your child.\n\nEither way, though, get child support. The kid deserves at least that from him.", "NTA - He fucked around and found out.... Although Jesus did say to turn the other cheek and to try to be like him.... Personally I would put your religion aside. Cause technically any child born out of wedlock is a bastard. Soooooooo yeah Christianity sucks anyways.", "NTA\n\nJust don't expect everything to go your way in court.", "ESH. Good chance that if he goes to court like you say, he can get 50/50 custody. The situation sucks, but a father should be able to raise his child as well.", "ESH there is a baby who needs someone (anyone!!!) to start thinking about it rather than themselves. It is in the baby\u2019s interests to have two civil parents who can participate in her life. Stop being selfish, start thinking about the baby and what the baby will benefit from.", "YTA. What are you protecting your baby from, his father?", "YTA. You have 100% custody anyway, so what is the point of court? You don't need protection. \n\nYou are only making it harder for the dad to get to know his child. If your child finds out you tried to block the father, your child will eventually resent you. \n\nKeep the meetings between child and father light with no pressure. For example, if he does not take the child Saturday afternoons, then what have you lost? You would have been home with your child anyway. He needs time to adjust and you all have to get comfortable in your new roles. \n\nMake sure he pays child support. Go to court on this topic, if necessary.", "Everyone is the asshole here. You\u2019re blocking someone who is trying to be involved in their child\u2019s life. You overrode his desire to not be a father yet by foregoing an abortion, and are mad now that he\u2019s not prepared. He said he wasn\u2019t, and you didn\u2019t want to listen. He definitely needs to get his shit together and be responsible. Cheating and waffling is no good either.\n\nHopefully once the child you\u2019ve forced him into being a father to is born, he\u2019ll get his shit together.\n\nEdited for punctuation.", "YTA.

If deciding if you even want the kid or not depends on who you\u2019re dating/marrying, and is always secondary to your relationship, I think that can end up as neglect for sure.", "I agree with Acrobatic.

Lots of women who have babies who did not want to get pregnant in the first place. Lots of women wind up having kids even though they thought about getting abortions. None of that means that these women should be denied the right to raise their own children.\n\nSpeaking of which, the OP\u2019s was most likely irresponsible in the situation as well. She probably had unprotected sex with a man who didn\u2019t love her and likely failed to take precautions to avoid getting pregnant. Should we call CPS to take her kid?", "It wasn't a party. There is no party in the main post. The anatomy scan where most people find out the sex of the baby is literally the most important scan of the pregnancy, as it looks to make sure everything is good developmentally. Op had to convince him to come to the most important prenatal appointment there is. And again, he told her after the scan that he needed to prioritize his new family over his child. This behavior will likely continue after the baby is born. The guy can't make up his mind, so op made it for him.", "But that\u2019s not a fair comparison. They both had sex, she got pregnant, she wants to protect the kid from a man who can\u2019t decide if he wants to be an involved father or not. That\u2019s what I got from him last saying he\u2019s \u201cprioritizing his new family.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, it can definitely end up as neglect, is what I should have said. A man who prioritizes his new wife over his child can *definitely* end up neglecting and even abandoning that child. Maybe he won\u2019t! But putting his kid second is an early sign that he could, so I\u2019d protect my child from that also.", "Ok. Same thing.  It\u2019s a gender scan.  The baby isn\u2019t going to care either way.  \n\nAnd we don\u2019t really know what \u201cneeds to prioritize his new family\u201d actually means.  OP gives no context for the comment.  But you\u2019re choosing to interpret it as prioritizing over the child. But that\u2019s not what he said.", "Where did he put the kids second? He chose not to go to the gender reveal party, which has no bearing on the child\u2019s welfare.  He and he made it clear that he wants to be a father to the child.", "The baby is not even born yet. Lots of men don't start out as great fathers. Acrobat is 100% right. He needs time to adjust.", "Bc he literally told her he wants to prioritize his \u201cnew family\u201d. Prioritize, make more important, than the baby. He\u2019s also only been with the fianc\u00e9e a couple months at most, based on OP\u2019s timeline. And already using her as an excuse to not be involved until the baby is born. So\u2026 yeah it\u2019s not looking great. I think OP should not ignore all of that in any world, especially right out the gate.\n\nETA: or how did you read \u201cprioritize his new family\u201d bc there is a world in which he meant new fianc\u00e9e and this baby I guess? I read it as new family = new fianc\u00e9e.", "He literally said he wants to prioritise his new family, that\u2019s putting a relationship in front of his child."]}
