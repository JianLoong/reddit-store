I actualy think it's a pretty cool name and have never met a Venus, thus I don't have any real bad connotations with it.

I'll agree that Redemption is a strange thing to name a baby. The bright side of that is there are plenty of cute nicknames that could be used. Venus isn't a stripper name.

Hopefully someone else says something about the names as well so it\u2019ll get through to her.", "ESH. Ultimately it's your sister's choice so you don't get to decide, even if she's asking for input. She could ask, get a majority answer and STILL not choose the name everyone else thought was good.

Just keep to yourself, it's not your kid, not your problem.", "YTA for calling them stripper names. Venus is a fine first name but Redemption I can agree is not.

Offer to look through names with her based on meanings or possible \"normie\" nicknames if she wants a certain vibe for the baby's name (I.E. if she's set on something along the lines of \"Redemption\", maybe offer \"Demi\" as a nickname or try names like Renee or Renata meaning \"to be reborn\" as some people see Redemption as a Rebirth, and so on. Seriously, etymology is your friend here.)\n5. Reassure her that you'll be supportive in the role of uncle regardless of what name she goes with and support that name to the best of your ability. Help normalize it with the kid and assure that it's a good name, at least until they are old enough to decide if they want to change it or go by a nickname they'd prefer. Even if you don't really think it's a good name, you want the kid to feel good and confident in the name they were gifted until they figure out if they themself have grown out of it or not. \n\nFrom my perspective as an NB person going through a social name change, if you raise the kid to understand that given names can be seen as something that is gifted from people, not something they need to feel chained to, and that it's okay if they find they've grown out of the name they were gifted, it'll make it easier for them to build confidence, self love, and maintain some level of good relationship with the person who gifted them the name. If you treat the name like that, the kid is less likely to develop bad feelings about it, and will have a better chance of learning what makes them feel the most like themself. \n\nRight now OP, you want to be in the position to support the kid. Even if you don't like the name, whatever your sister picks is something her child with live with for at least a little while.

I was moreso surprised someone actually named their child Bonez.", "When my kids were babies, (twins) we were out somewhere and there was a couple with triplets who were toddler aged. Two boys, one girl. Name D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Constance.", "I have twins, and when I was pregnant a local woman had triplet girls LaShondra, LaRhonda, and LaTonda. \n\nMy SIL is a teacher and had twins Lemon Jello and Orange Jello in her class one year. Really. \n\nAlthough there is Venus Williams. Venus is not that out of the ordinary, if the other names are basic. Weird is for middle names, at best.", "Oh come on now \ud83d\ude2d That's just awful. Do they go by their middle names?! If she wanted to do similar sounding names, she could have done Kaidence, Kayden, and well I'm not really sure but the point is a little more effort could have been put into that.", "Oh gosh no. Sorry maybe I wasn't clear. I should have said they were their legitimate names on their birth certificate! I genuinely thought they were nicknames until she showed me otherwise. She's also a meth head, so I can't exactly say I'm surprised.", "My parents named me something absolutely foul. When I became an adult, I changed it. 43 years later, my mother still dead names me.", "> Tiffany\n\nThere is a really good video from CGPGray regarding Tiffany as a given name, and it's a pretty recent one adopted from the surname of one \"Charles Lewis Tiffany\", a founder of Tiffany and Co. A lot confusion comes from a version of a medieval poem where somewhere during many iterations of copying, and transcribing from older to newer versions of English the name Theophania somehow got swapped for Tiffany in a book published in the 1700s. There were a few Tiphanies in censuses from the 1300s, but the link between them and the modern name Tiffany is pretty murky.", "Most names are quite old. But they're also very much subject to fashion trends, like kids in my country nowadays get names common amongst my grandparents and great-grandparents.", "It's definitely very old-fashioned! I learned it from Archie comics, haha.", "I don't know if it still exists but we absolutely had at least one clapping/chanting game as kids that made that rhyme. It wouldn't have gone well if we'd had a Venus in the school.", "Well, \"legally\" will really depend on where you are... But, Um, if you wanna see my side-eyes, show me a baby named Baby. \n\n(In Qu\u00e9bec it's actually illegal to give your kids weird names. I forget the actual criteria. But the govt wouldn't let you get away with like brand names, swears, insults, not sure about pop culture names...?)", "So many options!! Stormy April sure exist somewhere.", "Love it!", "I kinda love that.", "D'Artagnan?? Isn't that the family name of the fourth musketeer??\n\nI googled it, and yes it is the name of the main character, and Aramis is one of the 3 musketeer he meets and hold your beer, Constance is the lover of D'Artagnan. At least her name is a real name and not a family name... But damn how awkward, naming your kids after lovers...", "Nope! She refuses to allow nicknames or using their middles names. I feel sorry for the kids when they get older, and hopefully they'll all decide to change their names. For now, they are toddlers but it's just so darn confusing.", "Nah I probably just read it wrong. That does make more sense though!\ud83d\ude05", "I'm entirely convinced the concept of timeless anything is a myth. Names, fashion, decor, paint... It all goes round and round and round.", "I named my daughter Emily in 2015. She\u2019s the only Emily in her class lol. I loved the song \u201cEmily\u201d - by From First to last and when my ex was dead set of Faith as her name I offered Emily and Faith as a middle name. The kid literally matches the song so it was a good choice. My oldest is named Hadley after a minor characters name in a book I enjoyed. 3 years later and now there\u2019s a bunch of Hadley\u2019s.", "How do they know which child she's talking to? That's just so crazy to me. Did she ever explain her reasoning behind this?", "I think that was the most popular when I was in school \ud83d\ude0a", "Kali isn't pronounced like Callie - the goddess is pronounced with a long A, like the one in karma.", "I\u2019m going to guess the answer is \u201cno.\u201d \ud83d\ude1d", "She saw the name and liked it and couldn't decide whether to give it to the girl or one of the boys so... alternative spelling was her 'compromise'. She says they are all pronounced differently, depending on which letter you put the inflection on but they sound the same to me.", "I still love that book immensely.", "Grace was our #3 option. Lydia was #2."]}
