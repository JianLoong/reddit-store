I actualy think it's a pretty cool name and have never met a Venus, thus I don't have any real bad connotations with it.

Hopefully someone else says something about the names as well so it\u2019ll get through to her.", "ESH. Ultimately it's your sister's choice so you don't get to decide, even if she's asking for input. She could ask, get a majority answer and STILL not choose the name everyone else thought was good.

Just keep to yourself, it's not your kid, not your problem.", "YTA for calling them stripper names. Venus is a fine first name but Redemption I can agree is not.

Do those names sound a bit outlandish, of course they do,  but ask any elementary school teacher about the names they come across in their school. After listening to them nothing will surprise you.

I'm pretty sure Miriam is an older name than mary", "I must have missed that one. I thought everyone was talking about the post where everyone in the father's family was named Maria and she didn't want her kid lost in the pattern.", "And I think they replied to the wrong thread\u2026 unless I\u2019m the AH? \ud83d\ude15", "they\u2019re bad names because they dont even sound like real names, like redemption literally sounds more like one of those weird puritan names than a stripper name. the judgmental comment was unnecessary.", "It 100% isn't.  Feel good social media echo chambers to the contrary.", "How are you getting that takeaway from these comments though? \nStripper names are meant to be stage names and purposefully memorable and eccentric. No one in here is judging strippers at all. I dunno how this is your takeaway from this thread", "I would argue that society is trying to move past the negative connotations of SWers BUT on that same note, OP is TA for the tone and way he intended for it to be derogatory and negative with his use of \u201cthose are good stripper names, not Main stream names\u201d. \n\nHe could\u2019ve found a better way to phrase it, my legal first name is Mary-Jane sooo it\u2019s not exactly \u201clost\u201d on me what he\u2019s trying to say, but could\u2019ve been handled better all the way around.", "Clearly it isn\u2019t.", "It's a perfectly good name -- if you're an 17th century Puritan.", "It\u2019s gold either way.\n\nAnd I just noticed that you are a silly goose.", "But it definitely is for sure a name a stripper would use on stage. That isn\u2019t sexist at all.", "Please, I'm on my knees begging you, please share. My curiosity is beyond peaked", "[deleted]", "Guess you didn't read where she says she named her redemption because she came to accept her body and it's flaws. Not at all to do with her stripping. Because she's STILL stripping.", "It\u2019s not! It might be less common these days but it\u2019s also not a name people make fun of that I\u2019ve noticed. I mean if a kid wants to they\u2019ll make fun of a person or a name regardless but something like \u201cMary\u201d doesn\u2019t usually invite that.", "I could roll with Redemption as a middle name.  Honestly, I could live with Redemption as a first name and call the kiddo Ree.  I\u2019m not a fan of Cosmos, and think it is a silly name.  I\u2019m not a fan of Kali, but that is my personal preference, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the name.\n\nI\u2019m actually way more derisive if people who do the cr8tive name spellings.  Kynadeigh?  Ahnahleigh? Maisun? Exhaiveeare? Well, I\u2019m totally laughing inside my head at names like that\u2014and one of my kids actually has one of those names, just spelled traditionally.", "Now you say what everybody else was saying to the OP, haha.", "Yea they are horrible names.", "Duck, duck, as they say.", "??????????? What?????", "Shouldn't be pushing your problems on your children with their names.\n\nIt's not endearing, it's not cute.", "She was a nice person so no one cared that she had a crazy name. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right probably shouldn\u2019t be saying actual names of real people on this site... my bad oops!\n\nEdit \u2014 that\u2019s basically my thought on names if you meet \u201cMary\u201d & she turns out to be an ah that name becomes annoying .. my biggest name issue is when people change a \u201ccommon\u201d name to a crazy spelling \u201cMaree\u201d c\u2019mon!", "Having a child fucks with your body in crazy ways. Many women struggle to recover from the changes their body goes through. So if she's come to a place of acceptance about it and can go through this pregnancy grateful about it, I see no reason why not. \n\nAlso,  cute is subjective. I said it was. You said it wasn't. Doesn't change a damn thing. Y W B T A if you came across a child named Redemption and started finding a way to judge her parent about it.", "I don't fault the child for the poor decisions of their parents. \n\nSeems like most in the comment section find the name to be awful. But that's just the general consensus. You're free to have a differing opinion - which you do.\n\nSince she's not even had the child yet, hopefully OP's sister will continue to feel this \"redemption\" and acceptance of her body - since she's in for a lot more changes. Best of luck to her."]}
