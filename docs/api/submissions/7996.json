I actualy think it's a pretty cool name and have never met a Venus, thus I don't have any real bad connotations with it.

Hopefully someone else says something about the names as well so it\u2019ll get through to her.", "ESH. Ultimately it's your sister's choice so you don't get to decide, even if she's asking for input. She could ask, get a majority answer and STILL not choose the name everyone else thought was good.

Just keep to yourself, it's not your kid, not your problem.", "YTA for calling them stripper names. Venus is a fine first name but Redemption I can agree is not.

Do those names sound a bit outlandish, of course they do,  but ask any elementary school teacher about the names they come across in their school. After listening to them nothing will surprise you.
