First of all, I know from the title that I may seem like a control freak who needs to know everything my partner does but please hear me out. My fianc\u00e9 (26m) and I (26f) have a long distance relationship temporarily. He originally told me about 2 months ago that he wanted to get my name tattooed on him. Personally, I don\u2019t think anyone should get someone\u2019s name tattooed on them and I told him this, but I also explained to him that it\u2019s his body so the choice was his but to make sure that he thought about it because it was a permanent decision. He then proceeds to tell me that he wants to save money, so he\u2019s letting a buddy of a buddy that he barely knows do it at home. I told him that if he must get a tattoo to at least be safe about it and wait until he\u2019s able to save up and get it done by a professional in a shop because of the risk of infection, injury, etc. \n\nAfter talking more about it, he agreed that he\u2019d wait and go to a professional. Fast forward to yesterday. We were talking on the phone instead of video chatting, and he\u2019s telling me that he has a surprise to show me but wants to wait until we see each other in person. The convo went on, and after me trying to guess what the surprise was, he finally admitted that he\u2019d went ahead and gotten the tattoo from his buddy. But not only did he get my name, he\u2019d also gotten 2 more tattoos: one on his leg, and one on his FACE, right under his eye! At first, I thought there was no way he\u2019d really done that and was just telling me that to see my reaction, but as we talked more, I realized he was serious. He explained to me in detail the tattoos. I was livid. Not only did he put himself at risk by getting tattooed by an unprofessional, he put himself at an even *bigger* risk by getting a tattoo right under his eye. Also, he\u2019s been job searching, so now he\u2019s going to have a harder time getting a job since he\u2019s gotten a tattoo on his freaking face. \n\nI told him that maybe we should rethink our engagement because obviously we don\u2019t know each other as much as we thought we did. I told him that if he really knew me, he\u2019d know that I hate face tattoos and find them tacky and unattractive. They scream \u201cI make bad decisions\u201d, especially in the workplace which he\u2019s been having a hard time getting back into already and now it\u2019s going to be even harder. I also told him that I don\u2019t know him as well as I thought I did because he\u2019s not a man of his word. He promised me that he\u2019d wait to go to a professional but went back on his word and did what he said he wouldn\u2019t do anyways. Of course, he told me I was overreacting and made me seem like some stuck up b*tch who won\u2019t let him make his own decisions. AITA? \n\nPS: I\u2019d like to add that I\u2019m not judging people who have tattoos. He had tattoos when we met and even I have tattoos myself, but I\u2019ve always felt that  the line should be drawn at the face and personally don\u2019t like face tattoos.", "created_utc": 1687876538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kfg5f/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_fianc\u00e9_for_getting_a/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe 20 even 10 years ago this would be a strong stance, but as a recent college graduate with face, neck, and hand tattoos who immediately landed a corporate job after graduating I would argue it down. I have had jobs / internships at non-profits and law firms and the only issue that ever arouse was my nose piercing (That was in high school when all I had was a hand and wrist tattoo). I see it as a new generation entering the workplace means new norms maybe idk. \n\nBut everything else... a good clean tattooer I agree with.

Especially since the matter was discussed and he chose to move forward after OP voiced valid concerns. It is 100% his choice, but to berate her for not being onboard is an indication that they see decision making differently. Face, neck, hand tattoos limit job opportunities. I have a full back tattoo and others, so not against them, but due to working in HR in a corporate space, I chose my placements carefully. Not putting my self-expression above my livelihood. My heavily tattooed younger cousin, just got one on his face, which I don\u2019t think is a good idea, but he is a trucker with his own rig, so he\u2019s good.

Tattoos are permanent. I'm very pro-tattoo and have 6 myself. Your concerns about getting it done by a professional were also very common sense.\n\nIf THIS is the kind of thing he does on a whim, I also think it's valid to take a step back and reevaluate the relationship.

What could go wrong?", "He got a tattoo *on his face* without telling you.\n\nThat's not standard \"I got a tattoo and didn't tell my SO\" material, that's \"the firefly in my head isnt flickering a whole lot\" territory.\n\nGet. The. Fuck. Out.\n\nNTA, he's fucking crazy, and just waved a red banner for you and the whole world to see.", "NTA. I also have a tattoo, but it doesn't sound like he's going about this very wisely. Especially getting a face tattoo while job searching. There's a reason some tattoos are called Everlasting Job Stoppers.", "NTA - He an idiot and an ass. Not many jobs out there that would allow face tattoos.\n\nI have tattoos and when my kids wanted one I told them to make sure they can be covered up for job interviews and important meetings. They listened. \n\nLife will be hard for him in the work force and his earnings potential just took a major hit. You need to make the best decision for your future and it will be harder with him, IMHO.", "> but them refusing to do it doesn't make them a \"good\" artist.\n\n\"A good  tattoo artist wouldn't do a partner's name\" does not imply that refusing to do it make's them a good artist, it implies that not refusing to do it make's them a bad artist.\n\nAnd although it's debatable and down to personal opinion where that line should be, yes what they consider over the line or not does effect if they are good or not", "So, hopefully he will now need to get a coverup of your name, \ud83d\ude06", "Girl, break it off.  Do you really think that you will have a high quality or even normal life with a partner who is so reckless and impulsive as to get a random tattoo on his face?  This pattern will continue to repeat itself throughout your entire relationship.  What will you do if he suddenly decides to renovate your house and you come home to him having knocked down two walls without doing any planning?", "My husband has his wedding ring tattooed on. It's a small Celtic knot on his ring finger. He teaches elementary school and nobody has been bothered by it, but it's about as innocuous as a hand tattoo can get", "Generally agree except for face traditional face tattoos like ma\u014dri, Polynesian or First Nations cultures. But also only for people of those cultures with a tattoo artist who is also of that culture otherwise I\u2019m also really against.", "Ooh, wedding ring tattoos didn't even occur to me. Those are absolutely inoffensive too imo. And also a great safe alternative for people in certain careers.", "Face tattoos are absolutely the worst thing you can have especially if you\u2019re looking for any time of service orientated job.", "NTA.\n\nMany blood borne pathogens are communicable. Getting one done by a non-professional puts you are risk alongside him.\n\nHe may be willing to take the risk, but he doesn\u2019t get to decide if you are.", "He probably is having major second thoughts about getting married so sabotaged his relationship by deliberately doing what he did to get the result he wanted.", "You're not the asshole. I feel like I need to know what the other tattoos were.", "You are allowed to set expectations. \n\nFWIW, I don't like full beards. Goatees are ok, some mustaches, but I am not a fan of beards. So, I don't tend to date men with beards. I have had men I was in relationships try to grow them out, and I only said something to one as his beard came in three different colors and looked like a camo deal - not a good look.\n\nBut, beards can be trimmed, shaved, and in general are not permanent. \n\nA facial tattoo is something you will be looking at for the rest of your life if you actually get married - you'll \"see\" it more than he will. You are allowed to have relationships with people you find attractive. Also, unattractive, the bait & switch that he agreed with you, then totally blew off your convo and went ahead and did what he wanted without input.\n\nNTA", "You're not breaking up with him for getting a tattoo. You're breaking up with him for making an unsafe and irresponsible decision after telling you he wouldn't, because you now can't trust him not to do the same thing again and you need a partner you can trust not to make that kind of decision. \n\nThat's not trying to control his body. That's you wanting to be married to a grown-up, not an impulsive teenager.", "NTA for everything you\u2019ve already said, but let\u2019s also not forget about his appallingly poor judgment.", "It\u2019s not the artist\u2019s responsibility to control your decisions on what is dumb or not. It\u2019s the artist\u2019s responsibility to do a quality job!", "Education and skill set plays a role here, too.", "NTA \"I won't marry someone who jeopardizes his health and his future for an impulse and I will not marry someone who deliberately deceives me\" is a perfectly valid boundary to have", "NTA and all of your instincts are correct. You're probably much more intelligent and mature than your boyfriend, and you should probably be with someone who's more on your level.", "NTA\n\nHe clearly demonstrated he has poor impulse control, doesn't keep his word, and has no intention of being a financially-contributing member to the household, since he took actions he *knew* would block him from finding employment.\n\nOn the whole, it sounds like you're in a mommy role with him (carefully walking him through the thought process and consequences of the tattoo, providing for him, etc. Plus his teenage-rebellion \"I can make my own decisions!\" tantrum)\n\nI'd bail.", "NTA, but do not get married if you are not on the same page, which you clearly aren't.\n\nIt does indeed sounds like he acted impulsively.", "  \nNTA-- Sounds like a winner tho /s", "My brother did a rose with a small banner of his girlfriend's name on his arm. He joked that he'd cover it with a snake if necessary. Hers was a heart with his name on her stomach (low and on the side, in case she ever got pregnant). I've only seen it maybe twice ever. They were maybe early 20's (yep, that young and dumb age).\n\nThey've been married over 20 years now, together around 30. It's not always a bad omen.", "> it will affect me too\n\nNot if you do what's right for you and ditch him. He has low impulse control, and this will not change. If you marry him, you will be financially supporting him and doing all the housework. You will turn yourself into a bangmaid.", "Gonna disagree there, I'd say good artists have a responsibility to guide you through the process. We're talking about an (almost) permanent addition to your body. Good artists don't take that lightly.\n\nGood artists don't want to put something on your body you'll end up regretting for most of your life.\n\nWhich is why many artists won't immediately say yes to doing a massive chunk of work for your first tattoo. They'll feel out if this is really something you want to do.\n\nA good artist will do your face tattoo but will make sure you're sure you want it and will at least mention the potential consequences of getting one.\n\nArtist I know had a young woman come in very enthusiastically wanting some massive cliche tattoo done across her chest. Like a dragon or something. No piercings or tattoos on her. She also wanted to start getting her sleeve done after the dragon.\n\nArtist agreed and was free but told her to wait a week before coming back to make sure she wanted to get the work done. They found out a few months later that she was in the midst of a manic episode.\n\nAlso a cheap artist doing work in a private setting does not sound like a good recipe for sanitary work.\n\nSomething like a partner's name needs at a minimum a warning or a sly warning via something like the kiss of death. Tattoo artists have to draw the line somewhere, hate symbols being an extreme but obvious example.", "There\u2019s also a world of difference between a well planned, professionally drawn and applied face tattoo and a piece of garbage done by a scratcher in your buddy\u2019s garage, like OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 did"]}
