First of all, I know from the title that I may seem like a control freak who needs to know everything my partner does but please hear me out. My fianc\u00e9 (26m) and I (26f) have a long distance relationship temporarily. He originally told me about 2 months ago that he wanted to get my name tattooed on him. Personally, I don\u2019t think anyone should get someone\u2019s name tattooed on them and I told him this, but I also explained to him that it\u2019s his body so the choice was his but to make sure that he thought about it because it was a permanent decision. He then proceeds to tell me that he wants to save money, so he\u2019s letting a buddy of a buddy that he barely knows do it at home. I told him that if he must get a tattoo to at least be safe about it and wait until he\u2019s able to save up and get it done by a professional in a shop because of the risk of infection, injury, etc. \n\nAfter talking more about it, he agreed that he\u2019d wait and go to a professional. Fast forward to yesterday. We were talking on the phone instead of video chatting, and he\u2019s telling me that he has a surprise to show me but wants to wait until we see each other in person. The convo went on, and after me trying to guess what the surprise was, he finally admitted that he\u2019d went ahead and gotten the tattoo from his buddy. But not only did he get my name, he\u2019d also gotten 2 more tattoos: one on his leg, and one on his FACE, right under his eye! At first, I thought there was no way he\u2019d really done that and was just telling me that to see my reaction, but as we talked more, I realized he was serious. He explained to me in detail the tattoos. I was livid. Not only did he put himself at risk by getting tattooed by an unprofessional, he put himself at an even *bigger* risk by getting a tattoo right under his eye. Also, he\u2019s been job searching, so now he\u2019s going to have a harder time getting a job since he\u2019s gotten a tattoo on his freaking face. \n\nI told him that maybe we should rethink our engagement because obviously we don\u2019t know each other as much as we thought we did. I told him that if he really knew me, he\u2019d know that I hate face tattoos and find them tacky and unattractive. They scream \u201cI make bad decisions\u201d, especially in the workplace which he\u2019s been having a hard time getting back into already and now it\u2019s going to be even harder. I also told him that I don\u2019t know him as well as I thought I did because he\u2019s not a man of his word. He promised me that he\u2019d wait to go to a professional but went back on his word and did what he said he wouldn\u2019t do anyways. Of course, he told me I was overreacting and made me seem like some stuck up b*tch who won\u2019t let him make his own decisions. AITA? \n\nPS: I\u2019d like to add that I\u2019m not judging people who have tattoos. He had tattoos when we met and even I have tattoos myself, but I\u2019ve always felt that  the line should be drawn at the face and personally don\u2019t like face tattoos.", "created_utc": 1687876538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kfg5f/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_fianc\u00e9_for_getting_a/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're right to leave him for being a dumbass.

Run now because you're going to be supporting him from here on out unless he's part of the things that support face tattoos above. No one is going to hire him unless he gets it removed... and even then, you can still see it. My husband takes a yearly blood borne pathogen recertification, among others.

Nope.", "Honestly NTA. When you are in a relationship with someone you are that person\u2019s partner. That means you bounce everything off of each other and compromise. The fact that he broke a promise to do something so immature is a bit childish. He doesn\u2019t have a job and he just made it harder to get one, he\u2019s spending money irresponsibly, and he\u2019s throwing a fit when you call him out for his BS like a toddler. Glad he did this BEFORE you got married OP, I think you should so find someone on your maturity level because it isn\u2019t this guy.

Way to immature to be getting married. A face tattoo below the eye - was it a tear drop lol. Yeah, there is a reason CEOs of major fortunate 500s do not have any tattoos that would be noticeable with a suit on at least. Face tattoos scream gang, prison, criminal behavior and not the face an employer wants to our representing a company. His future warning potential is greatly reduced. The only names you ever tattoo on yourself is your mom and your kids those are the only people who will never leave you. Meaning, a spouse or GF you can get divorced but you usually don\u2019t go NC with mom or disown kids. \n\nOP please find a better mate for your future.", "Info.  Sorry it wasn't clear had you expressly said to him before you don't like face tattoos", "NTA. You're allowed to not like things. And you're allowed to feel lied to when he lies to you.

That's his right, but it is your right to get rid of him for this sort of behavior.", "Yep- sounds like time to end things- he knew your feelings and even lied to you! If this is what he does when he wants something, do you think his word will ever be believable? You can do a whole lot better than what you currently have.

I completely agree. Especially with it being dangerous. What upsets me even more is that we talked before and I expressed my concerns about how unsanitary being unprofessionally tattooed can be. He told me that I made a lot of sense and that he wouldn\u2019t put his health at risk. But he went and did it anyways and then tried to masquerade it as a surprise for me like I would be excited that he did it. If he gets horribly sick, it won\u2019t only affect him, it will affect me too and I\u2019m so upset at the fact that he could be so immature and selfish.", "I feel like I've seen an okay number of hand tattoos, as long as they're small and inoffensive. An old manager of mine had a little heart on the side of her ring finger, for example. Neck ones less common but I've seen one or two on the back of the neck where someone with long hair could hide it. Face though... I hate to judge, but I think you'd be really hard pressed to get a job outside of the arts or in a band or something \ud83d\ude05", "Wanting to add on to the blood borne pathogen front, if he does pick up something like hepatitis from the unhygienic friend of a friend, he could easily pass it on to OP.

My tatted up husband has strick instructions to NEVER get my name!", "One was my name on his arm, another was his year of birth on his leg, the third one was of a broken heart under his right eye. He really went all out.", "Honestly, no. We have talked about tattoos in the past but face tattoos specifically had never come up. I think it would have been nice to at least have the conversation about his decision to get a face tat before he went and got it. It would have been the perfect opportunity to talk more about it then. If the roles were reversed, I would have at least told him \u201chey, I\u2019m thinking about getting such and such tattoo on my face\u201d and would have cared to hear his opinion about it since it\u2019s such a permanent decision and we\u2019re getting married.", "I love tattoos, I actually have a sleeve on one arm and I\u2019m working on getting one on the other arm. I understand how it can come across as judgmental but I just don\u2019t think face tattoos are a good idea. They can\u2019t be covered up in a professional setting. Getting a face tattoo during a phase when you\u2019re young and care-free about life and have no responsibilities is one thing. But getting one when you\u2019re engaged, 2 weeks away from turning 27, and wanting to start/support a family but making decisions on a whim that can hinder your ability to properly do so is a completely different thing. Thank you for your answer, it\u2019s greatly appreciated.", "You\u2019re 100% right. It\u2019s his body and he has the choice to get whatever he wants on it. So, that means that if he wants to permanently mark his face without even considering how his fianc\u00e9 and future employer(s) may feel about it, he has the right to do so. But he will be making that choice single and unemployed.", "It is his body and OP would have been wrong if she hired some thugs or something to physically prevent him from getting them, but she's well within her rights to adjust the way she sees him based on all of the choices he made surrounding those tattoos. Frankly, he sounds like an impulsive idiot, which is a dangerous combination. The kind where everything is going fine and suddenly he's made a big dumb decision on his own and wants you to praise him for it.", "At least an asshole tattoo would\u2019ve been well hidden \ud83d\ude14", "But would only prevent you getting a very specific kind of work...", "Those are all really stupid tattoos to boot. I\u2019m baffled by people who are so attached to their birth year or telephone area code. There\u2019s really nothing he did right in getting a tattoo here. Unemployed - shouldn\u2019t be paying for one. Cheap/dangerous - from an unlicensed buddy. Bad placement - face tattoo. Bad taste - they\u2019re dumb. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with such dingus behavior from him.", "Wait. Why a broken heart under his eye? Was he anticipating you\u2019d break up with over it? Or was it for someone else? Either way seems like a poor choice was made in regards to your relationship.", "According to Google a broken heart tattoo is meant to mean the \"loss of a loved one or the ending of an important relationship' wonder how accurate that is going to be...", "Correction you were planning on getting married. Then you realized that you shouldn\u2019t marry someone so impulsive, doesn\u2019t think things through long term, and has reduced his career potential thus reducing his ability as a man to provide for his family. This guy is not fully cooked yet and you need to find yourself a real grown up man not an impulsive boy masquerading as a man.", "I generally agree but I think the question is, \"Why *should* we judge facial tattoos?\" I feel if it's tasteful, like a T\u0101 moko or something, it's fine. But that obviously has a very different presentation and meaning than most facial tattoos.", "I grew up in an anti tattoo family, but I've seen many that look cool. \n\nMy opinion is that they should be in a place you can hide in some contexts. And face tattoos are deliberate self facilitate.", "It might help you get very specific work lol", "A culturally or religiously significant facial tattoo is miles away from a random face tattoo administered by an amateur at the spur of the moment. And of course we SHOULDN'T judge facial tattoos but the fact is people do, and OP shouldn't be criticised for pointing out it's going to make it even harder for fiance to get a job. In his case, it IS a sign of poor decision making on every level."]}
