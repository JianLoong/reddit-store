Since there were no flowers, then that cost in particular is what needs to be refunded. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily argue for a refund about the other stuff not being as nice as expected but write down a list of everything that was not as discussed and review it with the business owner, and then say that while that was all very disappointing what you 100% expect as the very least she can do is for her to refund the money you paid for flowers that weren\u2019t there at all.", "Yta..?\n\nYou should get a full refund.\n\nTake the agreement and pictures of what was delivered, it doesn\u2019t sound like anything you wanted had been delivered.\n\nAlso, why agree to help if you are not actually helping?", "Get a full refund, NTA.

You may be out of luck on this, but if I were you I'd take plenty of photos and leave a review stating what was promised and showing what was received. At the very least, you may prevent someone else from getting ripped off. On the other hand, I'm so happy to see a wedding-related mishap not turning into anyone stomping out or calling off the wedding or blaming you. It's pretty refreshing on this sub to see adults behaving like adults with wedding/engagement plans that aren't exactly perfect! I wish your dad and his future wife the best.", "Here is where I shot myself in the foot. It was all verbal, albeit with witnesses (my husband was there, as was her friend).

I feel this was a lesson learned, it sucks, but not worth arguing for the full payment back, just the extra $200 and plan to leave no review.", "We are happy for him too, thank you!", "Paid upfront.
