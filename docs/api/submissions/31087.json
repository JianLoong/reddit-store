My (27M) fiancee (27F) has been playing this one travel game on her phone whenever we\u2019ve gone out, for the past few months now. The point of the game is to earn points by visiting as many places as possible (like restaurants or parks or monuments, etc.) Her family and a couple of her friends also play it, and they\u2019re all competing against each other.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is, this is exactly the opposite of how I want to spend my time off, which is relaxing, walking and eating. However, she\u2019s spending every day dragging me off to places, sometimes up to 20 attractions per day so she can level up faster. We don\u2019t even spend much time actually experiencing places before its time to rush off to the next one. I haven\u2019t been able to convince her to stop despite trying. She\u2019s invited me to play with her group, but I don\u2019t enjoy traveling like that so I refused.\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, after the first week, I got fed up and just put my foot down, leaving her to go back to our hotel. The following days I\u2019ve just been doing my own thing but she\u2019s been very upset and even complained to her family. What\u2019s unfortunate is that she\u2019s not great at navigating by herself and has gotten lost in the city.\r  \n\r  \nAm I the asshole in this situation?\r  \n\r  \nFYI, we both paid for the trip, not sure if that makes a difference.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: Fiancee treats vacation as a way to level up quickly in a travel game.

And then add to it that it is about a game and scoring points, as opposed to quality time, learning, exploring, etc. and it gets more annoying.", "NTA, her behaviour is ridiculous and, if her only objective is to collect points, she should have discussed it with you before.

She's allowing to competitiveness to cloud her judgment", "NTA because that\u2019s exhausting. But have you two never been on a trip together before?

Have you tried everything else? I\u2019d say leaving your SO kinda sucks but I\u2019m reluctant to judge here. Bit of an ESH situation imo", "RED FLAG", "ESH.\n\nThe problem here is that you enjoy travel in fundamentally different ways. She wants to get in as many Experiences as possible; you want to relax and enjoy where you're at. Neither of you is \"wrong\" in that - unless you're actively causing harm to someone, there's no Correct Way To Vacation - but you're *both* doing a terrible job of compromising and communicating.\n\nPick out a few things that you'd like to do together, then find something you can do solo while she dashes around racking up points. (And try to think of it as practice for when you're married. If you can't compromise on *this*, then you have a much more serious problem than whether you're having fun on vacation.)", "YTA. Communication is key in any relationship. Instead of ditching your fiancee, you should have had an open and honest conversation about your differing vacation preferences. Maybe you could have compromised and found a balance between relaxation and exploration.", "YTA, even if you\u2019re annoyed there\u2019s a better way to solve it than by leaving her in the street. Especially if she\u2019s prone to getting lost, that\u2019s a legitimate hazard", "Seems a bit YTAish\u2026how about you just chill in a known place and let her walk around visiting a few places and come back to you? Then you go back to the next place?", "YTA\nIt sounds like you have different vacationing styles. She prefers to see a lot of places, even if it means she can't spend that much time on any one of them; she's not necessarily optimizing for the game, the game just reflects how she wants to travel. You want to relax and it's not fun for you if you can't take your time and move at a slower pace. They're both valid approaches to travel which means you need to compromise. You could do things like split up for a portion of the day, only schedule stuff for the morning  while leaving the afternoon free,etc. Either way, that's something you need to decide together. If this was an argument before the trip I'd say no one is the AH. \n\nHer travel style is not my travel style and I could see how it'd be exhausting/annoying. But walking off and leaving her alone because you got too fed up with the game she was playing is an AH move. Especially since you both are in a foreign country and she has trouble navigating.\nPlus, this unilateral decision of how you both should travel and 'putting your foot down' is an AH move. Talk to your fiancee and see what compromise you can come up with.", "Go with her in the mornings, go get lunch with her, then let her do her game on her phone and visit like crazy while you have a coffee, then a cappuccino, then another in a caf\u00e9 with a nice view.

See ya at dinner \ud83d\ude01", "NTA.  You say you ditched her but from a different point of view you could say it was she who ditched you.  The two of you want different things out of this trip and there's nothing wrong with doing things separately.", "NTA. This sounds horrible. I\u2019d rather not vacation than do it like that.", "NTA. That sounds like a horrible way to experience somewhere. As you said, if you see 20+ sights in a day, with travel between, have you really even seen the sights or just got close enough for the GPS to ping you for points. What memories do you have of the trip other than rushing and looking at your phone.\n\nLike most time dumped into games, she'll look back in a few years and rue the time, and money, wasted for shit all in the way of memories or anything else meaningful other than a quick serotonin dump from the level up.", "NTA - My wife's family is like that (maybe not to the same extreme).  They rarely take vacations, so when they do, they try to pack as many things into their trip as possible.  It drives me nuts.  I mean, what's the point of vacation if you come back exhausted?  Also, have you really experienced anything if only spent 5 minutes there?", "NTA. A vacation where I am constantly pressured into \"doing\" places and things is so exhausting. Hey maybe you'll meet Hemingway and his gang at midnight in paris", "NTA.  But maybe plan on breakfast together, do your own things in the morning, meet up at lunch, repeat in afternoon, and meet up at end of day.  Help her plan her routes so that she loops back close to where you\u2019ll be when you meet.  Since she\u2019s getting lost, maybe she\u2019d be okay with being in a tracking app for the duration of the trip so you can help remotely navigate if she gets in a bind.", "NTA - What a waste of a vacation.  You can't truly experience a place at high speed, and you definitely can't relax. \n\nThis is your vacation too, and she needs to take that into consideration.

Your fianc\u00e9e sounds extremely immature.", "NTA \n\nPersonally that sounds like a nightmare. But even if it weren\u2019t, you also get to have a holiday, and if the person you\u2019re with can\u2019t compromise then it\u2019s absolutely ok to do your own thing. \n\nIf she\u2019s really invested in her game, then I\u2019m sure she could just enjoy and then you both have dinner together and share about your days?\n\nAlso, if she\u2019s on her phone surely she can use a map to get around?", "NTA\n\nIf you are on a vacation together, you either do things you both want to do, your separate things, or mix them up in a good way.\n\nShe dragged you around, and that's not ok. I'm not really clear if you told her \"I'm going back\" when you put your foot down or not. I suspect that you did, because why wouldn't you. That is pretty much the only instance in which I'd think you were slightly at fault (just leaving without a word), just because that's how I was raised.\n\nAn example: My mom took me on a (an?) 8 day cruise for my 30th birthday (also as a \"pick me up\" for how shitty I've had it recently), and the ship stopped at some islands (Mediterranean) where we could go ashore. Pretty much all activities hosted by the cruise were fully booked even 1 month before the cruise, and I have a slight fear of missing ships/planes, even though with mom there, she'd kept an eye on the clock for the departure. I learned after we got home that she would have liked if we went ashore a bit more (we got off 2 times out of a possible 5), but she never mentioned it to me, as she wanted me to enjoy the trip. Which I did. I love being on ships (frankly didn't want to leave the ship). She told me after I asked her about it, that she wasn't disappointed, just wondering if I'd gotten \"as much as possible\" out of the trip.\n\nThe difference with your story and mine is that my mom was fine with doing whatever I wanted. If I had wanted to do something alone, she'd just been on the sundeck lapping up the sun. You two went together, so she should have considered what you wanted to do. I mean, even when I played Pok\u00e9mon GO I still strolled around like a tourist when I was in the capital (more things to get than my town), because I still enjoy looking at the stuff.", "And you're planning on marrying this woman?
