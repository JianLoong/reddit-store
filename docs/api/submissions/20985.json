Also mum explained why daughter couldn't be left alone as daughter tends to get worse. \n\nShe's also still going through puberty, and her hormones are raging which may be why her anxiety is so servere and it may settle within the next few years if she puts the work in with therapy. \n\nRegardless, I'm not a mental health professional, I'm not gonna pass judgement on a teenager. I struggle with anxiety at almost twice this girls age, and for me the only thing that has worked it focusing on the rational of what's in front of me: I cannot control the future, but I can control pushing this chair back and forth. I am not lazy, that's my anxiety talking to me but I know the wall is blue because I can see it. \n\nIt doesn't work for anyone, but for me it does.

Focusing on the point and recitation would help me to calm down and sort of took my mind outside of the panic attack.

They also take so much out of you both physically and mentally, and OP says this was the worst one her daughter has ever had. \n\nOP did the right thing, her mom can grow the fuck up and realize that the moment her granddaughter was born, she would always come second to her, as she should, and OP and her daugher need to keep up the therepy.", "Oh yeah we wouldn\u2019t want to ask her personal questions after she posted personal information for us to make judgement on or anything", "It\u2019s not. Whether or not OP chooses to answer it (and they have numerous times in the comments now), if the daughter weren\u2019t in treatment, it is something they should be looking into it.

I  went where I needed to go (even in the midst of one of the attacks), but I can tell you right now that if someone had tried to force me in any way, I would have been concerned for their safety. Not in a I would have killed them sort of way, but in a I would have physically tried to get away and would have grappled with them to do so, which could have resulted in any party being injured. \n\nIf I were in a car and the person just took off, I can tell you right now I would have tried to get out of the car by any means. I can\u2019t speak for OP\u2019s daughter, but hers sounds far more severe than any of the ones I have, and it\u2019s not the right way to handle the situation.", "That\u2019s not how it works at all. Stop speaking on things you have no idea about.", "Nono, my fault I probably should\u2019ve put it in the post when people started asking", "Is she able to go to school? Does she have friends?", "I get that but I do think with teenagers SOMETIMES (not every time, for clarification) you just have to tell them this is how it is. You don\u2019t have a choice.

Like how they say not to give into babies when they cry for something because eventually they\u2019ll learn and figure it out.", "She does have friends and before she left she managed to go to school most days", "It doesn't seem like you do get it. Firstly, just to get it out of the way, you're misinformed about the best practices advised by childcare professionals. Letting babies just cry doesn't work, because babies do not have the capacity to \"figure it out.\" It just fills them with stress. And when they do start \"figuring it out,\" their takeaway (though they can't properly articulate it yet) is that they can't rely on their primary caregivers, and are therefore not in a safe environment. You can really fuck your kids up that way.\n\nI'm also troubled that you're comparing this clearly deeply troubled teenager to a fussy baby, but I digress.\n\nThis is obviously anecdotal, but I have some personal experience that may offer some unique insight here. I was a kid who struggled in much the same way as OP's daughter. My parents divorced when I was young, so I grew up going back and forth between houses. My dad responded to my illness much like you suggest. He did pay for my treatment, but at home, his approach was to try and toughen me up. When I was at his house, I just had to suck it up and do whatever or go wherever he wanted, whenever he wanted, even if I would inevitably cause a scene and humiliate myself by \nbreaking down in front of others (which he construed as a deliberately manipulative act). I never felt safe or comfortable under this approach, and he and I have a poor relationship to this day.\n\nIn contrast, my mom was supportive. She encouraged me to be brave but respected my limits. If I went out and had a bad time, she'd take me home, no questions asked. And if I just couldn't go at all, that was okay, too. That made me feel much safer and more confident, which enabled me to move further out of my comfort zone and make real progress.\n\nFrom what I've seen of her comments, OP isn't overly permissive and this kid is doing about as well as someone with her condition can be: she's in treatment, keeping good attendance in school, has a social circle, and supportive family. Forcing her to push past her limits just to appease OP's mom isn't going to help her or her progress, I assure you.", "That\u2019s a lot different than someone with very severe anxiety.", "I\u2019m confused as to how she can\u2019t handle the dinner if she has friends and goes to school. \n\nI don\u2019t have a kid but I\u2019m thinking there has to be a way to navigate this that isn\u2019t keeping her home whenever she has a flare up. Idk how she can be a functioning adult in society if this isn\u2019t figured out really soon.", "You\u2019re probably right. I don\u2019t know how this works so I\u2019ll take your word for it. But out of curiosity, what happens to these people when they get out into the real world? How do they lead anything resembling a normal life? And what causes this?", "Well at some point she\u2019s going to get older and meet people who aren\u2019t going to give an F about her severe anxiety. So a solution that is different than OP\u2019s is necessary.", "Sometimes her anxiety is randomly triggered and she could go to school most days just fine as the school know about her anxiety and actively helped her", "No offense, but yes, it's clear that you don't. Perhaps in the future you should refrain from making assertions and offering advice on subjects you aren't well-versed in, particularly when the health of children is at stake. I'm more than happy to answer your questions, though.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no simple and straightforward answers. There are so many factors at play that no one's experience is really universal outside of meeting diagnostic criteria. Some people are able to learn healthy and effective coping skills and do really well, others have a harder time (due to comorbid conditions, lack of social or medical support, external factors like poverty, etc.). Progress is also rarely linear; sometimes people will be managing fine until they just aren't anymore and need to return to the drawing board.\n\nI'm definitely not qualified to explain the causes of conditions like this because it's very complicated and I'm not a doctor, but the gist given to me by every expert I've spoken to is that, like most things, it's usually a complex combination of genetics and environment, though it can lean one way or the other. For example, like you mentioned, it could be the result of trauma. Based on OP's comments, it sounds like in this case, genetics were the primary determining factor. Either way, there are a wide variety of treatment options and coping strategies available, it's just a matter of finding the combo that sustainably works for a particular individual, which is much easier said than done.\n\nI won't lie, navigating the world this way isn't easy, and sometimes living the life people expect you to have just isn't possible. Sometimes you require more care and accommodation than those around you are willing or able to give you, and that can be hard to deal with. Some unfortunately don't survive it. I just hope we can work toward building a more compassionate world where we can experience normal human struggles in safety and security.", "You really don\u2019t get it, do you?", "YTA. This is insanity. You can\u2019t leave your HOUSE because your teen gets so anxious? No. That is not normal parenting.", "NTA. You were prioritizing your daughters HEALTH over your moms birthday.", "INFO were other people also having birthday dinner with your mom or did she end up alone?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is good and proper to priorize your daughter.", "NTA\n\nyou are doing everything right! you absolutely should be prioritizing your daughter's needs. Do not feel bad about this at all.", "NTA. \nAs a parent, your kids come first. \nAnd mental health is as valid and important a concern as physical health. Too many people treat mental health as if you can just \u201cget over it\u201d and be fine. Good for you for making your daughter as safe as you can.", "It\u2019s truly the only way there was one time when she was like this and I left her home on her own it\u2019s truly not a good option", "With this therapist she\u2019s come a long way I\u2019m extremely proud of her", "I have panic disorder. I\u2019m 35 and have been in therapy on and off since PRESCHOOL. IME therapy has very limited efficacy for panic disorder. It helps you cope with the panic and the disorder, but it doesn\u2019t cure the panic, because the panic is physiological. \n\nMeds help, but nothing cures me. This is just my life, like any incurable disease. \n\nNTA, you sound like a wonderful parent.", "I wondered who that 'trick' was aimed for. Whenever anyone tried to use it on me I became more irritable because I was conscious of my surroundings even in my debilitating anxious states. My anxiety wouldn't let me not know so it always felt stupid and talked down to.\n\nGlad to know it works for someone.", "Like I said, I am not an expert in any capacity. I just know what helps for me; I think people should do whatever it is they need to do to try to help themselves, and since it\u2019s so incredibly simple, no reason not to mention it in case they haven\u2019t tried it. Sorry it doesn\u2019t work for you\u2014 hope you have found something that does!", "All good haha", "Lol you should say \u201c you are absolutely right Mum, I am prioritizing my child over your birthday\u201d and just let that be it. She is a quick one that Mum of yours", "Info: is your daughter also medicated? Clearly therapy is not doing enough on its own if the attacks are escalating. The best outcomes are meds and therapy together", "NTA at all. As a parent that\u2019s your job.\nKids first.\nGood on you for looking after your daughter as you should!\nYour mum\u2019s being very juvenile!\nHugs to your daughter. \ud83e\ude75", "NTA. You prioritized the person who needed your presence and attention; that's not selfish, but throwing the word 'selfish' at you because she didn't get your attention does suggest Grandma might be an AH.", "She\u2019s always been the kind of person who believes your mother is above everyone else even your children.", "Coming from someone who has been diagnosed with a  severe anxiety disorder for 5+ years and has struggled with debilitating anxiety my whole life, this can absolutely be true for someone with anxiety. There have been days where I felt so anxious and sick that I could barely leave my bed, much less my house. \n\nNow, if it were everyday, that's where I'd be a little concerned but OP has clearly stated that this was a one time outlier event. Sometimes you just have bad anxiety days and it's entirely outside of your control. \n\nOP, like your daughter, being left alone after a bad anxiety attack is really detrimental for me and as someone who's definitely been where your daughter is, I'm glad she has a parent like you :)", "Yeah, it\u2019s never worked for me either. The only thing I\u2019ve found so far that works at least for a short period is sour candy, mainly Warheads.", "I didn't say not mentioned it. I've just gone through 10 years wondering who it helped. Not saying it never helps anyone. It just didn't help me or people I know."]}
