I do NOT appreciate you thinking it's ok they treat me like a servant to do their bidding, screw up my day, and you think I am in the wrong?  Well, let me have my family drop things off for you to do when you have plans and see how you feel. Better yet, you better take the day off from now on when they plan on coming over. \n\nSo you want me to deal with it? I will, but it's on your head because I am no one's servant and will not allow people to disrespect me. I will deal with this my way.

I do not appreciate you not outright asking me to do your laundry. More than that, I do not appreciate you treating me like your servant to do your bidding. Giving the silent treatment when you came into MY home. Disrespected me. Didn't care what plans I had. To do YOUR laundry. So from now on, unless your son has off, you will not be welcome at my home. Then he will be the one dealing with you as the disrespect you have shown me means I will no longer be interacting with you alone or much even with others. The fact that you see your actions as ok shows me how little respect you have, not only for me but your son and our home. I am no one's servant to do their bidding. Nor do I rug sweep to avoid the issue. Until you can act like mature adults and ask for what you want, show respect deserved, and come to me when you have an issue, then we have no reason to interact at all. \n\n\nPeople might see this as a simple thing, but I see this as a huge red flag. Your SO is ok with you being treated as the help. Expecting you to just do as they want or make it right when they are in the wrong. The inlaws expect you to wait on them hand and foot.\n\nHow far are you willing to let this continue? What else will they expect or demand because you don't put your foot down.

But there has been a significant breakdown here in communication. I've always said that 95% of the problems in relationship reddit can be solved with better communication. This is not one of the 5%. It certainly sounds like in-laws took advantage of you. It also sounds you two didn't communicate things very well. It would have been easier to just say \"hey, the laundry room is free on day X all day. If I need to leave while you're doing your laundry, just lock up when you leave. Fabric Softener is in the utility room in the hall.\"", "NTA. If they are adults, they know how to use a washing machine. They do not need someone else to do it for them. I've been in similar situations, needing to use someone else's machine because the one I had access to wasn't working, and I never expected the person to do my laundry for me. I always oversaw it.", "NTA.

If they were asking you to do the laundry for them, that\u2019s what they should have said. Asking WHEN you do your laundry, and then acting (but not even saying they were) upset about the fact that they had to ask you twice is so unacceptable on their part. No one is a mind reader! If they had asked, you could (and should) respond with a clear expectation - \u201cyou\u2019re welcome to come use the machine and hang out at the house on Tuesday afternoon while I\u2019m out doing xyz..\u201d or something similar.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to change your communication patterns, but things are SO much easier when you learn to clearly communicate your needs and boundaries.", "If they are adults with functional arms, they can do their own laundry. \n\nIf your BF is so overwrought with concern over it that he had the audacity to mention it to you, he can do their laundry.\n\nNTA but everyone else in this story needs an attitude adjustment as well as some reset expectations.", "NTA what are you their maid? Your BF can do their laundry. You are not obligated to do their dirty crap and they can be mad all they want. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Btw if your BF thinks you\u2019re wrong for this maybe you need to reevaluate your relationship", "Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I think it\u2019s ridiculous that you did their laundry. You should have spoken up as soon as she started showing you what needed to be done. If she takes that personally, that\u2019s her issue and better that than you becoming her maid. So I have to say YTA for doing her laundry.", "NTA. It\u2019s kind of you to lend your washing machine. You are not their maid nor a laundry service.", "NTA.  They gave you a test.

You agreed to them using your appliances, not you.\n\nDoes your bf do his own laundry? I somehow guess that he doesn't. In that case I would do only mine (for a while at least) and he can do his whenever he wants. As he thinks it's oh so easy, let him do it.", "INFO. Is the boyfriend the provider in you house? (Makes the money). Or do you also work? If you dont have work, and are free to be at home all day while your man works it should not be a problem for you to do some laundry for his parents for the short while theirs is broken.

Beyond their reaction, I find your BF\u2019s reaction more alarming/concerning. If it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d putting it in the machine, then why didn\u2019t he do it? It\u2019s his parents, he should have volunteered to do it rather than make you do it. I can\u2019t imagine making my partner fulfil a request my parents made until and unless I absolutely couldn\u2019t and we had communicated and confirmed they were comfortable helping.

When you did not take the \"submissive and dutiful\" route as they hoped you would, they basically forced you to do it for them...On their terms.\n\nI know your culture is different than mine, but coercion and manipulation are universal human tactics.  So is victim-blaming, which is what your husband did.  You're not acting out of line, but your husband will not see that...Because he does not see the problem.  Your husband saying your \"action showed a reaction\" was his way of saying you got a natural reaction to your not being automatically accommodating and submissive.  To him, the \"problem\" isn't the problem, because he does not see the actual problem as a problem.  He expected you to be submissive, too, and he agrees with his parents because he's been raised to expect the same.\n\nI'll expound that premise.  So while laundry is the subject here, the dirty garments are not the actual problem.  The *real* problem is that your in-laws expect to come to their son's home and be waited on hand and foot by you, and for you to do it not only without being asked, but willingly.  And not only are your in-laws expecting you to know this without being told, they are also willing to punish you if you do not read their minds and do what they want intuitively.\n\nNot only is that unfair to you, it's highly unrealistic.\n\nNow, from a cultural perspective, my reaction would have been quite different.  I'd tell the in-laws where the nearest laundromat, or tell my spouse, \"Your circus, your monkeys.  YOU do your parents' laundry, since you think it's as simple as just throwing them into one machine, and then the other.\"  It would have further been explained that if his parents were \"disappointed\", then they could stay disappointed, because I'm not about to cater to them the way I cater to their son.  There's a limit to \"respecting\" your in-laws, and what his parents asked and did clearly crossed several lines that I am unwilling to move.  But I'm Cajun, and women in my culture aren't exactly the most submissive beings.  We tend to be fire and ice, lightning and snowdrifts.  We are expected to be independent and hard-working, because our history taught us that there are some people who will intentionally cut a woman off from her family and make her start over alone.  We are survivors.  (Look into the history of the Cajun culture, you'll understand.)\n\nIn your culture, which I gather puts a different expectation on women, I have to say that your in-laws are pushing the limits of good taste, even from a Near- or Far-Eastern point of view.  You might have to tell your husband that in order to know what his parents expect of you, they have to state it clearly and not hint it; you cannot read someone else's mind.  And if your answer to it is not what they \"expect\", then perhaps what they are asking is unacceptable from a functional point of view.  Also, as a son, your husband has the responsibility to make sure his aging parents are cared for.  His foisting the responsibility onto you, and his family expecting that to happen, says that both of those parties see you as the domestic laborer rather than as a spouse with equal standing to her husband.  And that is awful.  Your husband is shirking his own cultural duty and making you do it instead.  You might need to have a sit-down with your husband when you are both calm, and hammer out what you will, and will not, accept as part of taking care of his parents when they are in need.", "Do they not have laundromats in your country?

It is good advice.\n\nAlso, note to the boyfriend who was willing to let his girlfriend be treated like a maid.
