I do NOT appreciate you thinking it's ok they treat me like a servant to do their bidding, screw up my day, and you think I am in the wrong?  Well, let me have my family drop things off for you to do when you have plans and see how you feel. Better yet, you better take the day off from now on when they plan on coming over. \n\nSo you want me to deal with it? I will, but it's on your head because I am no one's servant and will not allow people to disrespect me. I will deal with this my way.

I do not appreciate you not outright asking me to do your laundry. More than that, I do not appreciate you treating me like your servant to do your bidding. Giving the silent treatment when you came into MY home. Disrespected me. Didn't care what plans I had. To do YOUR laundry. So from now on, unless your son has off, you will not be welcome at my home. Then he will be the one dealing with you as the disrespect you have shown me means I will no longer be interacting with you alone or much even with others. The fact that you see your actions as ok shows me how little respect you have, not only for me but your son and our home. I am no one's servant to do their bidding. Nor do I rug sweep to avoid the issue. Until you can act like mature adults and ask for what you want, show respect deserved, and come to me when you have an issue, then we have no reason to interact at all. \n\n\nPeople might see this as a simple thing, but I see this as a huge red flag. Your SO is ok with you being treated as the help. Expecting you to just do as they want or make it right when they are in the wrong. The inlaws expect you to wait on them hand and foot.\n\nHow far are you willing to let this continue? What else will they expect or demand because you don't put your foot down.

But there has been a significant breakdown here in communication. I've always said that 95% of the problems in relationship reddit can be solved with better communication. This is not one of the 5%. It certainly sounds like in-laws took advantage of you. It also sounds you two didn't communicate things very well. It would have been easier to just say \"hey, the laundry room is free on day X all day. If I need to leave while you're doing your laundry, just lock up when you leave. Fabric Softener is in the utility room in the hall.\"", "NTA. If they are adults, they know how to use a washing machine. They do not need someone else to do it for them. I've been in similar situations, needing to use someone else's machine because the one I had access to wasn't working, and I never expected the person to do my laundry for me. I always oversaw it.", "NTA.

If they were asking you to do the laundry for them, that\u2019s what they should have said. Asking WHEN you do your laundry, and then acting (but not even saying they were) upset about the fact that they had to ask you twice is so unacceptable on their part. No one is a mind reader! If they had asked, you could (and should) respond with a clear expectation - \u201cyou\u2019re welcome to come use the machine and hang out at the house on Tuesday afternoon while I\u2019m out doing xyz..\u201d or something similar.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to change your communication patterns, but things are SO much easier when you learn to clearly communicate your needs and boundaries.", "If they are adults with functional arms, they can do their own laundry. \n\nIf your BF is so overwrought with concern over it that he had the audacity to mention it to you, he can do their laundry.\n\nNTA but everyone else in this story needs an attitude adjustment as well as some reset expectations.", "NTA what are you their maid? Your BF can do their laundry. You are not obligated to do their dirty crap and they can be mad all they want. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Btw if your BF thinks you\u2019re wrong for this maybe you need to reevaluate your relationship", "Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I think it\u2019s ridiculous that you did their laundry. You should have spoken up as soon as she started showing you what needed to be done. If she takes that personally, that\u2019s her issue and better that than you becoming her maid. So I have to say YTA for doing her laundry.", "NTA. It\u2019s kind of you to lend your washing machine. You are not their maid nor a laundry service.", "NTA.  They gave you a test.

Also maybe go run some errands or go for a walk as soon as they arrive,  so that they can't try to leave the clothes with you again.", "NTA you are not their servant. You agreed to them using your appliances, not you.\n\nDoes your bf do his own laundry? I somehow guess that he doesn't. In that case I would do only mine (for a while at least) and he can do his whenever he wants. As he thinks it's oh so easy, let him do it.", "INFO. Is the boyfriend the provider in you house? (Makes the money). Or do you also work? If you dont have work, and are free to be at home all day while your man works it should not be a problem for you to do some laundry for his parents for the short while theirs is broken.

Beyond their reaction, I find your BF\u2019s reaction more alarming/concerning. If it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d putting it in the machine, then why didn\u2019t he do it? It\u2019s his parents, he should have volunteered to do it rather than make you do it. I can\u2019t imagine making my partner fulfil a request my parents made until and unless I absolutely couldn\u2019t and we had communicated and confirmed they were comfortable helping.

Next question would you want someone you don\u2019t know well washing drying and folding your clothes? I wouldn\u2019t. He can do his family\u2019s laundry.  The reason it\u2019s sounds sensible to him is he probably doesn\u2019t operate the washer for your clothes .  Does he have any idea what laundry entails.  Only reason I would possibly do family laundry would be so I don\u2019t have to sit and entertain them while the laundry is washing and dry. You are allowing them to do their laundry in your home and with your machine, you are not obligated to do the laundry for someone else!  Sounds like power play and so next week you can tell them to go to laundromat.", "Personaly, if i lived rent free, without a job when my partner worked, i would gladly help out their parents when their machine is broken. Its really not a big deal lol.\n\nA lot of you people here on reddits are simply lazy sensitive, snowflakes. Dont take everything so personal.", "I would Gladly do it if i was jobless, living rent free and you where my lovers parent. Its not a big deal snowflake!", "Yes i agree with what you saying! and his parents seem a bit narcissistic. But as my OG comments ask , it could have been the situation that she did not work, lived there for free, and that she and her bf had arranged it so that since she didn't work she would take care of all the home stuff. If this was the actuall Context of the situation doing a few extra washes because the parents washer broke dosent seem like a big deal to me. It would only take 1-2 weeks to get a new one.", "Yeah, that's what makes me angry. it's not just put in the machine and then in the dryer. Of course I folded everything. And she has brought detergent. She also asked my bf out loud several times how much money she owed him for the laundry she had washed here."]}
