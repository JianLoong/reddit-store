No luck so far, and it\u2019s looking like we\u2019re going to need some kind of medical intervention. I\u2019m kind of struggling with this, whereas my partner is big into just \u201cit\u2019ll happen one day\u201d etc and refusing to go to the doctor.\n\nWe went to family dinner a couple of days back to celebrate his sister\u2019s engagement, where she also announced that she was pregnant - she doesn\u2019t do things by halves! Of course it goes without saying that I am happy for her, but other people announcing their pregnancies always feels like a bit of a kick in the gut and reminds me of my own fertility struggles. It also doesn\u2019t help that this family celebration also happened to fall on the one year anniversary of my miscarriage - which they don\u2019t know about. It also transpires that her due date is exactly the same as mine should have been. \n\nI of course was very congratulatory and told them how happy I was for them etc but on the inside I wanted to die. I then had to sit there and listen to my boyfriend\u2019s parents talk about how excited they are to become grandparents for the first time (though it should have been us first) and then have them make all the \u2018it\u2019ll be you next!\u2019 kind of comments. I found it very difficult.\n\nBecause of this, I explained to my partner earlier that I don\u2019t want to spend loads of time around his family at the moment because I feel like it\u2019s being rubbed in my face (unintentionally). There\u2019s several get togethers planned in the next couple of months and I just don\u2019t think I can face them. He said he understands but that I\u2019m being ridiculous and making it about myself when I should just be happy for his family.

His family isn\u2019t throwing anything in your face. They\u2019re living their lives. When you become a parent, you\u2019re going to want his family to be happy for you and show your support. You would be really hurt if one of his family members decided to avoid you just because they\u2019re struggling with something. You\u2019re also setting your partner up to spend the next several months explaining your absence at family gatherings. He can\u2019t tell them the truth so he\u2019s going to have to lie for you in order or preserve your relationship with his family. That\u2019s not fair to him. There are better ways to cope with this issue.", "You need counseling.  You won't get over the miscarriage,  but you can learn to live with it. The loss of a child is not easy, and so many people need help to deal with the devastating depression that comes with it.\n\nThe dates make this harder for you, but they are no longer \"your\" dates. Maybe the universe is trying to replace the pain with a reason to be happy on those dates?\n\nYou are nta for missing your child. But you are doing yourself no favors by dropping out of life.", "NAH but they\u2019re not mindreaders. They shouldn\u2019t be expected to be sensitive about a situation that they know nothing about.

You\u2019re not holding the fact that they\u2019re unaware of your pain against them, either, and you\u2019re not attacking his family members for celebrating the news of the new baby in the family. You weren\u2019t rude, you weren\u2019t unkind, and you had the conversation with him one-on-one privately afterwards. \n\nAsking for space to process your own complicated feelings in a situation like this is a good move, especially if you\u2019re as aware of your own emotional state as you are here. If you struggled through this first conversation like this, it\u2019s logical to assume that the next several months of non-stop-baby-talk might be painful or difficult for you to process. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019d seriously recommend maybe looking into some counseling or therapy to help you process your miscarriage and grief, prepare yourself for the new family member coming, and to learn some coping skills and strategies that can help you heal and come back to this in a better place. It sounds like you just need some tools in your toolbox to help you. \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for needing space and time to process your emotions, and they\u2019re not assholes for celebrating the pregnancy. I\u2019d be honest with your partner about your feelings-really honest about how you\u2019re hurting-and explain to him that choosing to take space now could avoid a potential breakdown later on down the line that could be much messier and much more painful.

You admit that they are not doing anything intentionally to hurt you.

I'm sorry you had a miscarriage,  but you can't possibly accuse the people of rubbing her pregnancy in your face (even unintentionally) when they never knew about your miscarriage in the first place.

But OP, it is impossible for someone to \"unintentionally\" rub your face in anything. So, I think you're really hurting and perceiving your family's happy news as happening \"to\" you. It's hard not to. But, I would encourage you not to let their pregnancy affect you in any behavioral way. Please don't let your lack of success thus far take on a life of its own. 31 is still young enough to get pregnant, even if you need medical help. Try to be positive and use this as the impetus to get all tests done on yourself.", "NTA.\n\nSo, I was preparing to read something entirely different, maybe something a little more along the lines of a main character syndrome... but no... you're not making the family feel bad, you're not being hateful or passive-aggressive, you're just working through things and don't want to be brought down or bring others down until you get a handle on it. It's hard for you. It's hard for a lot of people in your shoes who still want to be happy for their friends and family, while still being a bit heart-broken yourself. Some smiles take more energy to force.\n\nYou'll definitely need to get a handle on it at some point, not for anyone else but yourself. So I *do* encourage you to seek some therapy.\n\nAnd it sounds like you and your boyfriend need to have a real sit-down talk... it doesn't sound like you're on the same page and I don't think he fully grasps how painful this whole experience has been for you. And it's not unheard of for men to avoid fertility tests because of the whole stigma around that for both bio men and women, so he may not be being totally honest with you, either. Sometimes ignorance is bliss.\n\nGood luck to you, and I'm sorry for your loss.", "NAH. I certainly understand you\u2019re hurt. This is not something you get over. That being said however, they have every right to celebrate the pregnancy. It\u2019s going to be a grandchild for them. It\u2019s been over a year since your miscarriage and you can try again and they did acknowledge that. \n\nI think what your boyfriend said to you was not very nice but I get where he\u2019s coming from too.

Let go of that \u2018miscarriage aniversary\u2019 thing. Theres no such thing. Its toxic, holding you back and creating unnecessary resentment.

The therapist will likely tell you if you do not feel you are strong, emotionally enough to go to those family get togethers now then don't.\n\nNo, you can't avoid your partner's family forever.

There are resources online, groups you can join etc that will support you in talking about your baby and your infertility issues and coming to terms with your loss. Your partner may be hurting more than he is letting on and may beveey fearful about medical tests, may feel somewhat responsible for loss etc so you guys really need to talk it out.

He should be supportive and trying to help you but instead he says you are being ridiculous for losing a child (yes they count as a child) and you should be happy instead...

That's not good if you are both not on the same page.", "NAH - I'm so sorry for your struggles.  Those feelings must be at war inside of you right now!

Of course, OP had unfiltered thoughts going in her head when there existed this feeling of wanting to die upon hearing something nice that happened to other people. But OP didn't cause anything harmful to anyone, she didn't ruin the event, she did the most logical thing anyone in her state would do which is telling her husband of how she felt when they were alone.\n\nWhen she said she wanted to avoid going to the get togethers, that is because she doesn't want to get the 'I wanted to die' feeling again. I agree with many comments that urged you to seek professional helps, but I also disagree with people calling her asshole because of the unfiltered thoughts of someone who is trying the best, who hasn't made anything assholish so far.", "I\u2019ve been in your exact shoes, except the SIL knew about our struggles, the medical journey we were on and my miscarriages. \nBut I compartmentalized it. My ex and I have very small families, and were very close. So I had \u201cno choice\u201d but to just be happy for her, and her baby. Her happiness and excitement took nothing away from my grief, although it was a bit of a surprise to learn she was pregnant in the first place. But we went along to an ultrasound appointment and were the first at the hospital when her baby was born. \nFor your own sake and sanity, try to not see this as a jab from the universe at you.\n\nIf I may interject some unsolicited advice, try to talk with your husband again about consulting a doctor. Where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s not that uncommon to ask input from a doctor when after a year of trying, there has not been a successful pregnancy. Also, the cheapest and easiest test, is of his swimmers. Who knows, it might be an easy fix.\n\nOh, NAH", "I actually can't believe the top comments on here at the moment when you're clearly N T A. I would say NAH here, with the possible exception of your obtuse husband. \n\nMaybe a lot of people on here just don't understand how hard fertility struggles can be. I had a miscarriage this time last year - literally this week last year - and it was devastating. Every emotion you have expressed there about how you felt when your SIL announced her pregnancy is a valid one. \n\nI went to grief counselling after our loss (I highly recommend it by the way) and even then it was literally months before I could be in the same room as a close relative who was also pregnant. She was due a couple of weeks after I would have been and I initally couldn't cope with the constant reminder of what I had lost. \n\nDon't mind the people on here saying you're the asshole. No, your in-laws etc don't know of your miscarriage, no they don't know of your ongoing difficulties, but you are still allowed to have mixed emotions about other people's pregnancy announcements. \n\nWhat's important now is seeking out help for yourself, because ultimately you can't avoid your in-laws indefinitely. I would also tell them about your miscarriage, which will hopefully prevent any further  \"you're next!\" comments. \n\nFinally, a year is a long time to be trying to conceive without any luck at your ages, so I would probably also drag my husband to the doctor by the ear to get a few tests done if he wasn't willing to go himself.", "Both NTA and YTA. \n\nYou are allowed to feel your feelings. Fertility issues is one of the most painful experiences anyone can go through, and I\u2019m sorry. I know that seeing other couples, especially family members, easily experience something you want so badly can bring up all sorts of hurt feelings. That\u2019s so normal and valid. \n\nBut. You know that it isn\u2019t their fault. They are not deliberately trying to hurt you. They aren\u2019t even aware they are hurting you. Fertility isn\u2019t a race or a competition (as much as it does feel like that sometimes). \n\nYou have to find a way to process these emotions healthily and without taking it out on others. Journaling, therapy, screaming into a pillow when you need it, whatever helps. \n\nBut don\u2019t pull away. As much as it hurts, you need to stay present. Pulling away is only going to male it harder for you long term emotionally. Imagine pulling away and then seeing them when she is 6 months along or 9 months or when the baby is born? The alienation will feed into itself. \n\nYou are NTA for your feelings but you will TA if you act on them in the way you\u2019ve described. There are other paths.

I had JUST gotten my period the day before and of course I was hysterical that yet again, I wasn\u2019t pregnant, and so I told my husband I couldn\u2019t face seeing their babies because just the thought made me want to cry, and I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself.

It wouldn\u2019t hurt your partner to go as well so he knows how to properly support you. He isn\u2019t being supportive right now and that sucks. \n\nAs I was going through an active miscarriage we had a family member announce their pregnancy. I had to distance myself for a bit which my husband completely understood. I also had two pregnant friends at work that I had to shop for baby shower stuff for and that was my own personal hell. These things will get easier to deal with, but you need to talk it through with someone.", "NTA \nYou have a boyfriend problem. Why is something that is so painful to you a secret from his family and non-issue for him? Not talking about it like you did something wrong adds to the stigma and he doesn't appear to be in the same place in life as you are with wanting a child. You need open and honest communication!", "NTA! But you should seek therapy. Life goes on, and you can\u2019t always go around feeling like this. Also go to the doctor alone to find out, if something is wrong and if the doctor can help. You don\u2019t need your bf to go with you. Stop sitting down and letting life happen. Get up and do something about it, and stop feeling sorry for yourself. Go to the doctor and get answers.", "NTA - I think you\u2019re being fair by making a point to recognize that none of their behavior is meant to hurt you in any way, but you have to take care of yourself. Infertility is something I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone and I struggled with it for years, and I know how it feels to wrestle with the pain of ongoing disappointment and the guilt of struggling to feel happy for others announcing pregnancies. \nTalk to your gynecologist about your concerns, as you\u2019re still pretty young and there are varying levels of medical intervention. Maybe you have PCOS and it affects your ability to track ovulation or even have a productive ovulation, but taking something like Clomid could be enough to get you there. Or maybe there are no issues and you just need to track things a little better. \nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss and for your struggles. I wish you peace and hope for the future.", "[deleted]", "NTA - it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re not putting your own need to process on them but also trying to do what you need to protect your emotions. Maybe come up with a compromise with your partner like one family event a month and the others he\u2019ll say you\u2019re busy until you\u2019re feeling up for it.", "NTA, I kinda understand the yta comments BUT you did this in private/didn\u2019t blast it and decided maturely to want to distance because you don\u2019t want to be in constant pain to your partner. \n\nYour partner doesn\u2019t seem like he understands like what he said contradicts itself. He understands but proceeds to say you\u2019re making it all about yourself? He can go to his family events by himself because he really can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to lose a baby in your body so there\u2019s that imbalance already. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go to family functions, you could give your support in other ways and give a call or card. You could even explain the reason and just try to cope in other ways. \n\nI don\u2019t understand some of these YTA comments, it\u2019s like you guys are wanting this woman to be stuck in the grieving process and go to a family function when she\u2019s still hurting. You can\u2019t force a woman to go to an environment where she\u2019s constantly hurting unintentionally. \n\nYour wording OP was a bit off for parts of this but I understand what it meant.", "Nta. You weren\u2019t rude, didn\u2019t make the gathering about yourself , and you know they haven\u2019t done anything wrong . You just want to somewhat remove yourself from painful situations in the future . The timing just makes it incredibly hard to ignore. Your boyfriend sadly will never truly understand .", "NTA \n\nI do think your BF dismissing your fertility concerns and refusing to go to the doctor is deeply problematic. And also dismissing you being sad about it is awful. Why can't he talk to his family about it? Why hasn't he offered? \n\nI am really worried about your BF's reaction to everything here and the total lack of support (which is how it seems from your post).", "NAH\n\nYour feelings are valid and understandable. You\u2019re not being ridiculous. \n\nThat being said, please get some therapy. Avoiding his family forever isn\u2019t a sustainable plan. You need some help processing your feelings, and some tools to help you to manage them. It\u2019s okay to take some time out while you do that.", "NTA at all. People are getting so hung up about the 'rubbing it in my face' comment but it's pretty clear you just mean that the situation is constantly in your face, in a way that you can't ignore. You're not accusing them of anything.\n\nIt's smart to take some distance from a situation that is actively hurting you. Being constantly around someone who has what you want is rough, regardless of who's at fault. \n\nThat being said, it's also smart to actively try to do something to help you heal, beside that. If I were you I'd do the following:\n\n1) Consider letting his family know what you're going through and how, even though you're happy for them, being around them all the time is hard. If you distance yourself without explanation you're risking your relationship with them, which can also impact your husband. A good, open conversation can help everyone and avoid misunderstandings. \n\n2) Your husband may be fine with the situation now, but it's hurting you. Going to the doctor about possible fertility issues would help you get some peace of mind, because part of your pain is clearly the fear that you won't be able to conceive and carry to term. Have a serious conversation with him, so that he can understand having answers can alleviate your pain. Is there a reason he's avoiding it? Could he be scared about finding out one of you is infertile? Avoidance of the issue is not helping any of you. \n\n3) The most important, and the one thing everyone agrees on: Seriously give therapy some thought. Your pain and suffering can be reduced through therapy, and that will help you not push away your husband and his family. Your mental health is paramount, but avoiding your SIL cannot be a longtime solution! \n\nI'm sorry you're struggling so much. Stay strong and seek help! It does wonders!", "YTA as someone who has gone through this twice. Please reach out to a therapist. Your anger and frustration is misplaced. If you don\u2019t process your feelings you will end up resentful, and damaging the relationship with your in-laws.", "NTA. You should consider trauma therapy. This is a difficult situation and until you have a successful pregnancy it will continue to be difficult. \n\nYou will be ok. You will have a child. It seems hard now and it is, but you will get through this. Don\u2019t pull out of everything just do what you can, and avoid what is too much. \n\nThese people aren\u2019t trying to hurt you. They\u2019re just excited for the future.", "YTA for wanting to distance yourself from his family when they did nothing wrong. You would very much benefit from talking to a doctor or therapist about you possibly being depressed.", "Go ahead and take your time to mourn, you did everything right. Your partner should understand, as he must be struggling too but it sounds as he is just in denial. \n\nNo ones an asshole, they don\u2019t know what you went thru. You can go ahead and tell them, but keep in mind that won\u2019t change that they have a grandbaby on the way and their excitement, but could help with the support and giving you space. \n\nTake all the time you need to heal, and good luck forming a family when the time comes", "YTA for saying that \u201cit should\u2019ve been us first\u201d and \u201cshe doesn\u2019t do anything by halves\u201d. \n\nThe whole family was together and wanted to celebrate this. I\u2019m sorry that pregnancy isn\u2019t working out for you. That\u2019s painful. However, are you sure your boyfriend is even that into the idea of this pregnancy? He doesn\u2019t seem super invested in making it happen anytime soon given that you\u2019ve been trying. \n\nAlso I\u2019m really suspicious about the \u201csame date\u201d for both the miscarriage and due date. Most couples don\u2019t announce their pregnancy until after the first trimester, which would mean she\u2019s likely at least 12 weeks into it.

That\u2019s just it - no one knows. It\u2019s your business whether to keep it to yourself, but then withdrawing from family functions (which I\u2019m sure will be noticed) isn\u2019t really a coping strategy.

I\u2019m kind of struggling with this, whereas my partner is big into just \u201cit\u2019ll happen one day\u201d etc and refusing to go to the doctor.\n\nWe went to family dinner a couple of days back to celebrate his sister\u2019s engagement, where she also announced that she was pregnant - she doesn\u2019t do things by halves! Of course it goes without saying that I am happy for her, but other people announcing their pregnancies always feels like a bit of a kick in the gut and reminds me of my own fertility struggles. It also doesn\u2019t help that this family celebration also happened to fall on the one year anniversary of my miscarriage - which they don\u2019t know about. It also transpires that her due date is exactly the same as mine should have been. \n\nI of course was very congratulatory and told them how happy I was for them etc but on the inside I wanted to die.

The longer you both wait to get answers the longer it's going to be before you have a resolution. \n\n\nYou need to explain to the family that you guys lost a baby a year ago before you had the chance to announce and that it's been extremely difficult to grieve and that on top of it you seem to be struggling to conceive again and that while you're elated to be an aunt you would truly appreciate it if babies weren't the topic of every conversation or gift and that if you're feeling overwhelmed etc you will be stepping away (not attending) for your own mental health and so that you're not taking away from their happy times. \n\n\nAlso ask that they don't ask or comment about whether or not it's \"your turn\" to have a baby BC it only reminds you of your loss and brings up a lot of pain. Tell them that you'll keep them in the loop and announce a pregnancy as soon as you know next time so they can be excited with you guys, tell them you'll need support if there is a fertility issue and that you'll keep them updated about what's going on and when so they can send their well wishes or prayers or whatever it is your family does. \n\n\nLastly, try not to be too hard on your husband about this.

Therapy could help you deal with your loss and be able to talk about it or if you don't, to not distance yourself from everyone else. \n\nAlso I would talk to your partner again how you feel about the miscarriage and not getting pregnant after that.

She just needs time, space, and understanding.\nAnd it might be time for the OP to talk to a counselor/therapist.

There needs to be a way for you to move forward; grief counselling, creating a little memory box or however you feel comfortable because you will always be your little lost one\u2019s mum, but they were not ready for the world and once you accept this, although it will still hurt, you will love with the hurt rather than it taking you over.

There is no reason to make them feel worse than they will already feel when they learn that you miscarried.

Oh she really doesn\u2019t want to be here because she is Soo incredibly jealous she\u2019s not having the first baby that she is choosing to stay home and pout? Or maybe she\u2019s not here because she thinks that the universe being mean? Your absence will speak volumes, but you go ahead and spare those feelings. \ud83d\ude44", "**You have no idea whether your boyfriend\u2019s sister also had miscarriages.**  Even if you directly asked her and she said no, you\u2019ll never know whether she did and simply doesn\u2019t want to share with you - since it\u2019s exquisitely painful, just as you know first-hand.  And perhaps deeply personal.\n\n\n\n\u2018It should have been us first\u2019 is both a huge assumption and reeks of jealousy, regardless of whether you had malicious intent when you wrote it.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but YTA.  Therapy will help.  Take care of yourself.\n\n\nETA:  **For anyone downvoting me, why do you think it\u2019s appropriate for OP to assume her boyfriend\u2019s sister never had a miscarriage herself?**  Let alone any other possible siblings and their partners.  We all agree that miscarriages are horrible and tragic, but I think it\u2019s insensitive for OP to assume she\u2019s the only one in the family who has experienced this.  Very sadly, miscarriages occur in a significant minority of pregnancies.", "I\u2019m sorry you have some pretty shitty people in your life. I have friends who have dealt with infertility and miscarriages and such and they don\u2019t get that at all from people who know and are close to them, everyone is extremely compassionate and supportive of them.", "Eh, I think the YTA are focusing on the fact that she wants to remove herself for MONTHS. I'd be completely in her corner if she wanted a couple weeks or even a month. But several months of not showing up to family events she has a history of attending with no explanation is AH territory. \n\nIt sounds like she feels trapped and alone in her fertility struggles, especially with her SO not wanting to get tested. But the answer to that is not cutting people off without notice or reason. She needs to get into therapy and have a come to Jesus talk with her SO.", "This. And I also think it's wild to assume OP hasn't been to therapy...one can go to tons of therapy and still grieve!\n\nNAH. OP, just take the time you need. You don't need to tell them why unless you want to. But it also won't help to be mad at them for what they don't know--about your miscarriage, and also about how hard fertility challenges are in general. Just take space, withdraw if you need, prioritize yourself.", "I bet most of the people saying YTA read the title and skimmed the post. \"Avoiding my partner's family\" sounds aggressive, like she's deliberately snubbing them at the family picnic and uninviting them from Thanksgiving dinner. Skipping a couple of family gatherings, on the other hand, is really mild.", "eh, 60% disagree 40% disagree with that i'm gonna stick with my opinion, but still i believe that is possible, had the partner's relative known of the miscarriage, this conversation wouldn't have ever existed.", "Yeah, I think I\u2019m starting to get resentful over it. It\u2019s a stupid male bravado thing I think and it needs to stop.", "I would say this over anything else. Couples. Therapy. \n\nYou can't punish your boyfriend by making him choose between you and his family by boycotting family events. I mean, you *can* but it's unadvisable.", "I think that, as clunky as it might have been, boyfriend's parents were all-too-aware of the possible dynamics and were trying to be kind. \n\nIf I were someone's parent, I would assume they would have told me about a pregnancy and a miscarriage being on the short list of people who would find out early and before the general announcement.", "They WERE pregnant first, and it WOULD have been the first grandchild. This isn't about entitlement or jealousy; it's about grief. If OP's child has lived longer, they would have gotten to do a pregnancy reveal. If OP's baby had made it to birth, they would have been acknowledged as the first grandchild. But their child is dead and these stark reminders of how differently things went than how they could have gone, just put a bright, stark, spotlight on their private pain.", "She did get pregnant first.", "She means that her unborn child should have been the first grandchild, and they would have been if not for the miscarriage. Not that they *deserved* to be the first to produce a grandchild.", "It is completely reasonable that OP could have thought she was completely fine. There's a lot to this pregnancy that is overlapping and mirroring her own though, so it does make sense it set her off.\n\nPushing someone into situations that constantly make them upset and uncomfortable is how you get drama. Stepping back when you feel overwhelmed is reasonable or you are way more likely to escalate a situation. Everyone has a breaking point. If you know there's a chance you're going to ruin their good vibe, then, yeah, you gotta step away.\n\nBf is asking her to *act* happy. The reality is simply she is not happy for them; it is a painful reminder. Family needs to knock it off with the \"you'll be next\" comments too, which likely made this worse. Never, ever comment on someone else's pregnancy status unless they bring it up first. That is the general accepted polite scenario. That way, you avoid situations like these. Whether they knew about the miscarriage or not, they are overstepping into very personal territory by bringing up OP.\n\nMaybe therapy is the right call for OP, maybe she just needs to normalize herself to the situation. Either way is going to take time though, so avoiding large gatherings isn't an awful idea", "I agree that she does need some kind of therapy, but I'm sure that this has opened up all those old scars again, and she would rather be left alone for a time to go through the emotions again. I also think that she does need to tell people eventually, but any time soon probably isn't the right time to do so.", "It\u2019s not just what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s the comments of \u201cit should have been us\u201d giving the first grandchild that rubbed me the exact wrong way. OP seems to be in a competition that the SIL had no idea she was in. For that comment alone, OP is YTA", "I think a pregnancy announced a year after the miscarriage with the announcement of the same due date as well makes this pregnancy a bit hard than others have for OP.", "I went to therapy and support groups for infertility, and the therapists actually encouraged us to take space from other people if we need to while we're going through our struggles.", "She\u2019s also dealing with fertility struggles with a partner who doesn\u2019t seem to care about it. It\u2019s not just a \u201cone thing happened a year ago so I\u2019ll be upset forever\u201d thing.", "That\u2019s a real misrepresentation of grief therapy and what it\u2019s capable of. It doesn\u2019t stop people from feeling sad about their loss; it helps them to keep living their lives while carrying that loss with them, and knowing when to take a step back from situations that are painful is a big part of it, especially when that painful situation happens around the time of an anniversary. I\u2019m not saying that OP wouldn\u2019t benefit from therapy, but even with therapy, she still might not be able to whole-heartedly celebrate other people\u2019s pregnancies until she has a living baby in her arms, and that doesn\u2019t make her broken or bad.", "She's not holding a grudge, she's just looking at the timeline she thought the whole family would more or less follow and mourning how it's slipping away. At this point she and her husband haven't even begun infertility treatment. It could be years before they ever conceive again, if at all. \n\nAs someone who did extensive fertility treatment over many years, and then finally gave birth to one healthy child, I can tell you all that one of the most difficult aspects of it is having your peers transition into parenthood while you are in a holding pattern, never knowing if you'll ever be successful. Then there's the grief of having to let go of one dream after another. It's brutal.", "I get that, and maybe she's still grieving what happened, but I'm just focusing more on the fact that she wants time away from these people while they celebrate something she's struggling with. With that being said, I also agree that there are other steps she could take to help her out, like therapy, but I don't think it's selfish to want time away from people. That being said, there's a few possibilities that aren't being said in the post, like if she does plan to do this temporarily or if she expects her boyfriend to not go to any of his family gatherings alongside her, but I do think she does deserve to step away from the celebrations in the correct circumstances.", "I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell anyone about what happened now while they\u2019re all celebrating SIL\u2019s pregnancy. By doing so, it makes it about me when it shouldn\u2019t be, and I\u2019d hate to make them feel uncomfortable in sharing their excitement. My issue is with my partner, really, for not being understanding.", "Yeah, because OP was obviously not comfortable sharing the news with anyone for whatever reason. She was more than likely in a very dark place and grieving the loss of their unborn child. I'm sure quite a few people have kept things from others who have then gine on to celebrate the same thing happening to them. Either way, them talking about it will just be a constant reminder to her of what could've been, and if she were to bring up her miscarriage now, it would certainly kill the celebrations. It's best to just remove herself from the situation temporarily.", "Yeah, as in *the situation* is rubbing it in her face. And she's right, it is.", "Thank you. I experienced a loss earlier this year, and I remember that I hardly ever wanted to do anything with my friends and family after the funeral. The only person I wanted to socialise with was my boyfriend. People grieve a loss in different ways, and everyone's way to grieve is totally valid.", "I also had a late, extremely traumatic miscarriage and agree that OP is the AH. I feel for her deeply but this behavior is extremely immature, illogical, and self centered.", "I hear that, but some ppl are shittier when they find out about a mc. Imagine comments like \"was it stress?\" or \"don't worry, you'll have another\"...which if you've had a mc you probably got, it's mc bingo. (I'm sorry for your loss btw.) She doesn't owe it to them to tell them as long as she isn't mean about it.", "I'm trying to see this from the family's pov. If I was pregnant, had just announced it, and my SIL just suddenly decided to skip every single family gathering (maybe even the holidays? Halloween is closer but Turkey day is not that far from now either) for months without an explanation, I'd worry and probably ask my brother if something had happened and we just don't understand.", "Instead of being open and honest with everyone she is just waking away. This will cause a rift it the family and with her partner. Her spending less time means he will spend less time or have to lie about her absence. Which will leave them wondering either what they did or wondering if she is coming in between the partner and his parents? Either way this will cause a rift.\n\nHer wanting time is not the issue. She is walking away and not explaining why she needs the time that is the issue.\n\nThe family will never understand why she is distancing herself and maybe her partner. This will cause a rift between them. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to explain the trauma of the miscarriage, however I think it may help to explain that they are having fertility issues and she needs some time. His family is blissfully unaware there is even an issue. They won\u2019t know,and will speculate why she is distancing herself.\n\n\nAND  the punishment comes from the family not having the partner(their son) and her at family events thinking they did something.\n\n\nI know my option isn\u2019t a popular option but honestly I think a lot of issues snowball when we are not honest with people. When we just distance ourself we leave room for speculation. Also if I was the mil and I was hurting my dil I would hope instead of distancing themselves from the family they come to us and let us find away to where she would not have to isolate herself. I would never want one of my kids ( when I say kids i include the dil and son in law) to feel like they need to isolate themselves from the family.\n\nIf they need a mental break that\u2019s fine. I will respect that but if they wAnt to be here then let me help find away to help you. If that is hosting 2 events or 2 dinners to make you feel welcome and wanted then we will do that.", "Ooh, I missed that. That really does change everything. I don\u2019t blame OP for not wanting it known, like at all. But unfortunately, these are the type of situations that you can find yourself in if people don\u2019t.\n\nNobody can treat lightly if they don\u2019t know anything about the path in the first place. I will edit my comment. Thank you for pointing that out.", "Thank you, I had indeed missed that part. I\u2019ve know edited my comment. I think unless I missed something else I am still leaving the part i mentioned about the husband though.", "No, people are saying open up to the fam because they will support you, don't just wallow in your pain alone and then resent them for it.\n\nWe are also saying the \"I should have been first\" mindset is unhealthy (and not kind, rather selfish for no reason - other women in the fam might have had miscarriages too, what does she know..?)\n\nI'm also not sure how the husband is the A H? Did he do something? Except he should probably start the treatments..?", "No I didn\u2019t - I said I feel the universe is rubbing it in my face (mostly down to the coincidence of the dates) and that I feel like I need a bit of space to avoid getting upset around all the baby talk.

Hes not your husband (no judgement, it doesnt matter\u2026.) but are you on the same page?", "I could be completely wrong but...\n\nDo you think you might also be resentful toward your bf because your SIL is now engaged and you aren't? That once her guy found out she was pregnant he proposed but your bf didn't when he found out you were pregnant.\n\nAnd now it's a year later and you seem to be serious about your relationship and starting a family but maybe your bf isn't, and that's why he isn't proposing and doesn't want to do IVF?", "I don't think OP is punishing him. She's just saying that SHE doesn't wanna be around his family for a while. If he feels like that's saying 'choose between me or your family' then that's something he needs to work out.", "We don\u2019t know that, though. The boyfriend\u2019s sister could have had pregnancies that ended in miscarriages prior to OP\u2019s that OP doesn\u2019t know about.", "And OP has no way of knowing whether her boyfriend\u2019s sister had miscarriages, too, either with this partner or another in the past.  OP is making a major assumption that because she was pregnant last year, that meant it was the first pregnancy out of any of her boyfriend\u2019s siblings or their partners.", "But why does being first even matter? First isn't more special than the others unless you make it have an elevated status. OP doesn't need to elevate \"first grandchild\" to a special status.", "She\u2019s making a comment about events that are happening for months, it sounds like she might be thinking long haul for not going to the events which is going to put her BF in a bad situation with his family unless everyone can know the why. \n\nSaying you\u2019ll be next is a common comment with no ill intention from the family. I don\u2019t actually think  it\u2019s generally accepted with family to not comment on someone\u2019s pregnancy journey. The opposite is true. Families tend to act like it\u2019s for public opinion. \n\nI personally don\u2019t comment on people having kids because I don\u2019t really care.", "It's not reasonable. Today, when so many demonstrate regularly the trauma that comes with a miscarriage and with infertility, it's not reasonable for someone experiencing both and reacting poorly to others who aren't to believe that they are fine.", "Yes but there will be consequences to her not going to the events and her inability to celebrate her SILs pregnancy. I think it could damage her relationships so hopefully she tells them sooner rather than later so she doesn\u2019t create unnecessary friction. \n\nFrom SILs perspective, not knowing about the miscarriage. She might take it as OP being just jealous and see it as a slight on her kid/ their niece or nephew", "In the same sense, but different senecio. My grandma passed away, at her 1 year mark my dads mom passed away. I was in no way close to her (my grandma basically raised me and my daughter who was 5 at the time and I lived with her when she passed due to cancer complications) I broke down and missed work. I was a wreck for a week. Not because I was close to her they\u2019re basically strangers to me, living 16 hours away and have all my life, but because I wasn\u2019t healed yet. \n\nI can understand where she\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s not the pregnancy, it\u2019s not the announcement. It\u2019s the day it happened, and the due date matching what hers used to be. Not a single year goes by where I\u2019m not a complete mess on the day of passing and her birthday. She\u2019s not healed, she congratulated them, but with things still being fresh clearly, and the dates matching with what she hold strongly to her heart trauma and all is what\u2019s getting her. She will come around, she just wants a few weeks to not be completely around the family. And when you were supposed to have the first baby and someone else gets to have the first baby instead, that alone can be pretty hurtful. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, weather they know or not, but she\u2019s excluding herself a little bit to get herself together.", "\nTotally beyond me as well. Thank you,", "I think that's a bit of a runaway narrative. We've no idea of the relationship between OP and SIl other than this one unfortunate interaction.\n\nTo me \"it should've been us\" felt like grieving that moment of excitedly telling the grandparents to be.\n\nUndoubtedly OP needs therapy or maybe a wake up call but a miscarriage is some rough shit for a lot of people.", "I think the \"it should have been us\" is less of a \"We should have been first!!\" and more \"the baby we lost would have been the first grandchild.\"", "But she is not wrong. I want to make sure to say that it have to be like that (as in she needs to be the first) but if she wouldn't have a miscarriage, she would have been the first one. \n\nI think with her in-laws saying that unintentionally like that, of course it crosses her mind that it would have been her child, that would have been the first grandchild if she wouldn't have had a miscarriage.\n\nAnd yeah I do agree she needs therapy but she is definitely NTA for this.", "I missed that originally, yessss it does sound like she is making it a competition", "The \"it should have been us\" comment I think just meant that had she not had a miscarriage then her baby would have been the first grandchild, and would have meant that she had her baby there with her etc. I think it was just worded a little poorly, I don't think OP actually means that SIL *shouldn't* be having her baby before OP", "Or maybe she feels like her child is being ignored. She is a mother, she carried a life and lost a child. Yes any age means she had a child.  \nMaybe the sentence is meant like \"You are ignoring the fact I had a baby grow inside me, I had hopes and dreams of this child and now you ditched them for this one\". I mean really, if they knew she had a miscarriage, that phrasing is pretty fked up no? I dunno why people seem to want to see the worst in someone.", "They can\u2019t control that since they didn\u2019t know. OP also mentioned she doesn\u2019t want to see them for a bit then brings up months of planned events. It sounds like she wants to stay away for months. She needs to get help.", "But OP admitted it was done unknowingly", "All of this. I think those feelings are very hard to understand for people that haven\u2019t experienced them.", "Stepping away is fine, but she really does owe them a conversation about why. Not because they deserve to know her business, but if OP values the relationship then they do deserve more than absence and silence. Even a vague reason and a request to respect her privacy would do.", "I get it, but of you just disappear that\u2019ll hurt them too. It must be so hard to navigate this, and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through it. Good luck to you.", "You\u2019re completely in the right OP, people calling you an asshole have no reading comprehension. It\u2019s completely understandable and normal to be upset at someone else\u2019s pregnancy news when you\u2019re struggling with fertility. You didn\u2019t project that onto her, you handled it with maturity. Having some space to yourself is totally reasonable. Your partner SHOULD be more understanding, and it\u2019s frankly concerning that they are not.", "I'm surprised I've had to read this far to find this. I absolutely agree with you.  I take nothing from OPs miscarriage trauma, it must be awful. But. How on earth she thinks not telling anyone, especially family - in-laws or not - about it is going to help I don't know.  It puts the partner in a very difficult situation and let's not forget, he has also lost a child too and she hasn't even given any hint there's thought or compassion for him. I'd bet any money, if the sil and parent in-laws knew, they would be mortified at their comments and be incredibly supportive and understanding. We've been given no reason to think otherwise.", "You are being completely reasonable and I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't handle being around pregnant women either.\n\nEdit: a LOT of people are commenting you need therapy. It might help, but therapy is not magic. I have had therapy and I still find baby showers and surprise announcements unbearable. Grief isn't suddenly gone just because you talked to a therapist about it.", "Also to be honest, even if they knew, I bet no one except for her and maybe her partner would even remember a miscarriage anniversary. It's been a year. The other woman is allowed to celebrate her pregnancy with her family.", "eh idgaf", "Yes. It was him that started the whole conversation about trying for a baby, me coming off birth control etc. It\u2019s also him who tries to symptom spot every month around my period due date, if I say I feel sick or tired or whatever he gets his hopes up. I think he\u2019s anxious to go to the doctor in case we discover that the issue lies with him.", "I don\u2019t want to get married, he knows that. So no.", "Yah, I think it's implied, but it sure would be telling to see what happens when he chooses to go to the first family event and she stays home. He's going to have to either be the one who shares that miscarriage news alone, make up excuses for why she's not there (again), or stay home with her in solidarity. \n\nAlso worth thinking about how long that goes on for? If she's this rattled about the pregnancy announcement, certainly the birth of their baby won't be better, given their overlapping due dates. Is that kid's 1st, 2nd, 3rd birthday going to be too hard for OP as well? That baby's first cultural holiday celebrated with family?", "Saying you'll be next is a terrible thing because people like OP who have had a miscarriage and are having trouble conceiving exist. You never comment on someone's pregnancy status unless they bring it up. Period. Families are the worst offenders of this. Being family doesn't make it better, whether or not there is no ill intent. In fact, it probably makes it worse because they are the people you can't really call out without drama.\n\nLong haul or not, asking OP to suck it upand be miserable isn't going to end well. The fact is OP is not happy, seeing SIL is painful. Saying \"OP has been under the weather\" is gonna be a lot better than OP having a meltdown. You cannot ask a person to repeatedly go into a stressful or painful situation and expect them to be ok.\n\nIt doesn't sound like OP and bf's family are close enough she's comfortable sharing deeply personal information. Furthermore, if they aren't the most empathetic group, this can make it worse on OP. If they are, you risk people feeling bad and putting a damper on SIL's pregnancy. OP's solution is the most neutral option", "She is jealous. \"We should have been the first\" always rubs me the wrong way, as if the kid is some competition and not a real human being", "I get that, and I do agree with everything you said. However, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to just take a little time to herself away from her in-laws. I would never say any of this if she was planning to go low/no contact with them permanently.", "Assuming SIL even knows. Just make vague excuses. OP never said she wasn't going to any- just that there were a lot coming up. Show your face on smaller public gatherings. If SIL and OP aren't close, she may not even notice. There's going to be other family around.", "If she\u2019s had a miscarriage the family doesn\u2019t know about, then she should be aware that SIL could have had a miscarriage she doesn\u2019t know about.

I should have a child now, if only...\"  It's not competition it's \"if only\" and grieving what could have been.", "Op is yta here.  Def sounds like a competition and miscarriages are extremely common so we dont know what sil went through", "Exactly this, thank you for wording it better for me. \n\nThere\u2019s no competition, malice or sense of entitlement meant by that statement whatsoever.", "They didn't know. They aren't ignoring anything.", "they are ignoring because they don\u2019t know", "I agree that she does eventually need to tell them what happened if she values her relationship with her in-laws, but I think maybe missing out on a couple of gatherings is perfectly reasonable. If it were me, I wouldn't want to tell them right away, as SIL deserves to have her special moment, but it is definitely something I would bring up after a while.", "He needs to nut up (no pun intended) and go to the doc. There is no excuse.\n\nRight now he is making *you* feel lesser, making you go through this alone. You both need therapy\n Together and apart.", "Her husband could always just say she didn't wanna come and move on about his day. He isn't required to make excuses for her. He doesn't have to share the miscarriage situation, and he doesn't have to stay home. If he'd skip out on a family event because he feels obligated to since his wife doesn't wanna go then that's on him.\n\nAnd she doesn't have to be there for the birthdays or holidays if she doesn't have to. Again, she doesn't have to force herself to be around people she does not wanna be around. If it's hard for her to do it, then that's fine too. I completely understand that. At least she's not angry, and at least she's not taking the negative feelings she has out on the baby specifically. \n\nThe same way her husband can invalidate her feelings and say she's overreacting as if he's the one that had the miscarriage, he can tell everybody that she didn't wanna be there. Easy as pie.", "I think it was bad wording. What she said was,\"We should have been first.\" What she meant was,\"My baby should be in my arms now, and isn't.\"", "No it's \"my baby should be in my arms right now, my baby should have been born 6 months ago and be in my arms right now and my sister in law is now having a baby and told me on the anniversary of losing my own and has the same due date as me\". Don't assume malice or shallowness or competition or any of those sorts of things when there is a perfectly real, understandable reason right there.", "Agreed.  Miscarrying a child that is wanted is always tragic, but OP does not get to project her frustrations and sadness onto family members who don't even know it happened and blame them for her feelings and then turn around and avoid them because she's jealous of her sister-in-law's pregnancy.", "That's what got me. OP is def the AH. She sounds like she's going to hold it against everyone else that she didn't have the first baby. Like it's some kind of competition.", "From the post it sounds like they didn\u2019t tell anyone of the miscarriage, it sounds like the family just knew they were trying. \n\nFrom bfs response I think they will know if he starts going to events without her. Hopefully she feels comfortable to tell them the situation.", "They said they didn't know the anniversary, I assumed they knew about the miscarriage itself.", "Yeah that's how I took it as well.", "Depends on how often the events are. \n\nAlso, OP said they didn't know the anniversary, which would be fairly normal, that doesn't  mean they didn't know about the miscarriage \n\nAnd no, she doesn't need to tell them. They need to just not comment on OP's pregnancy status at all unless OP brings it up. Situations like this are why that has become the polite thing in regards to pregnancy", "I assumed they didn't know about both, like the miscarriage happened before the announcement, but am probably wrong rereading it.  \n\n\nEither way, I can't suggest much more than counseling for OP and maybe change my vote to NAH. I'm a guy, so I'll never truly understand the emotions and problems that happen from pregnancy, post partum, or a miscarriage."]}
