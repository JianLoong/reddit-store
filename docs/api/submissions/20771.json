This is a shock, considering the fact that I come from a black family, and in the black culture, mental health and therapy, are not believed in. \n\nWhen I started therapy, my grandmother kept sharing her opinion about how she hated the fact that I was in therapy, and how she thought that I could just talk to her about anything, and I didn\u2019t need to be sharing all of the family business and my personal feelings with a complete stranger. Being raised in the black community, I can somewhat understand where she\u2019s coming from. However, I am breaking that cycle and having a different opinion and a different approach towards mental health. \n\nA few weeks ago, we were having our weekly argument about my therapy, when she said something that made me so upset, that I nearly stormed out of the room.

I want to make sure that you\u2019re telling the truth, and you\u2019re not exaggerating about what I did or what anybody else did.\u201d \n\nI informed her that she was not allowed to sit in on any of my therapy sessions, as that is a private session, and not a group one. I also informed her that my therapist would not allow this, as it breaks the confidentiality agreement. \n\nHer response to this was \u201cI don\u2019t give a rats ass if it breaks a confidentiality agreement thing, or you don\u2019t want me to be, or I\u2019m not allowed to be. I am going to be sitting in on that therapy session.\u201d \n\nI told her again that she wasn\u2019t allowed to, and that I was going to leave it at that.

I am not going to let you sit in on my therapy session. End of conversation.\u201d \n\nShe then proceeded to walk out of the room, call my father, and tell him to stop paying for therapy because I wouldn\u2019t let her sit in on a session. \n\nMy dad then called me, and gave me an ultimatum. He told me that if I didn\u2019t schedule a family session for the following therapy appointment, which was a week from then, he would stop paying for therapy completely.\n\nI then told him that I do not want to schedule a family session, because I know that it would result in yelling, and fighting. He kept trying to convince me to schedule one, and I just flat out said \u201cif you want to schedule a family session so bad, then why don\u2019t you get a family therapist for us?

It's actually really weird and if your dad had any sense he would be concerned too. No grandmother on the planet would be this invested if they weren't scared about what you're saying and there's no good reason for her to have those thoughts regardless.", "NTA. But I would suggest a family session might give your therapist a lot of insight. You should also speak to them about how you\u2019re being pressured into it. \nI\u2019d suggest speaking to your dad about how important this is to you and letting him know that you do not want your grandmother included in any knowledge about your medical appointments going forward.

That way you can be the one who did something proactive , without giving in to her absurd demands. Chances are no one follows through on it anyway. \n\nNot sure where you\u2019re located, but if your dad ever stops paying for therapy, there may be low cost options available to you. I did this when I was your age and like you knew I needed support but couldn\u2019t pay for it myself. Obviously it\u2019s best to remain with your existing provider since you have established a rapport with them, but just something to have in your back pocket.", "Nta, but you\u2019re an adult.

OP let your therapist know what\u2019s going on.if your father stops paying they may reduce your fees based in your income or lack of.

Lol.", "But we don't know if OP can afford it on her own..", "I'm pretty sure I couldn't come up with $150-300/ session when I was 20.

CBOs depending on your location and age there are some community based organizations that can link you with inexpensive therapy referrals, telehealth, clinics? \n\nThis situation won't help you with your mental health, bullying their way into your therapy sessions, is counterproductive and takes away the sanctity and safety of therapy, then there's the constant fear and anxiety that anytime dad/grandma feel some kind of way they'll pull the plug on therapy. You need to find a different way to pay for it outside of dad, for the sake of your mental health.", "NTA. When I was a kid and wanted therapy, my mom said the exact same thing as op' grandma. \"Why can't you just talk to me,\" \"I can't have you sharing the wrong things,\" etc. Then, when I was an adult and started therapy, my mom asked for the name and phone number of my therapist because \"they should hear my side of things.\" But ironically, I offered for her to do some sessions with us, and she flat out refused and talked about how she doesn't \"believe\" in therapy... Toxic", "NTA.\nHowever, if you are in real danger of losing the financing for your therapy, most therapists are accustomed to having a session with family members to reassure them while revealing nothing of what you said in confidence or pressuring you to participate beyond your comfort. They are also adept at ending a session that devolves into unproductive screaming. If you must, ask your therapist if they think they can do one session under those limits to get your relatives off your back.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour father needs to grow up and tell your GM that she doesn't get a say.", "i\u2019m a full time student without a job at the moment, so not right now. i\u2019m working towards it tho", "If you're in school, can you try connecting with the student resource center to find school supported therapy programs. Does your school have a campus counseling center? \n\nSome schools even have low cost/free therapy for students and programs where grad students and professionals offer therapy for the clinical hours.\n\nMy adhd threw me for a loop in college (Black as well and it took so much convincing and years for my parents to finally understand/accept a diagnosis and mental health so I went around them and used my school resources) and my school helped set up on campus therapy sessions  using students/staff.", "Some will do a sliding scale", "I am a clinic psychologist, and in a situation like this, I would tell anyone who made those requests, \u201cas I am OP\u2019s therapist first, it is an ethical conflict of interest for me to also serve as a therapist for a family session. I can provide some excellent referrals.\u201d\n\nI do have visits to help my patients discuss things with their family members (eg, \u201cidk how to talk to my partner about my depression,\u201d or \u201ccan you meet with us both to discuss some communication skills,\u201d) but that is WORLDS different.", "I will say that allowing your grandmother, or anyone else, to come into your therapy sessions can be helpful. You can set up ground rules, that your therapist can enforce (and if they are good, they truly can), to help to focus the session on issues you want to discuss. It's your session, not your family's, so you can have your therapist keep it to those things that relate to you.\n\nI also want to let you know that this isn't just a black family thing. This is an everywhere thing. Where there is discontent in a family, it's a thing. I'm so white that I am see-through at times (seriously, I see my veins in my arms as if it were a CAT scan in the winter months). My mother would ask why my therapist was blaming her (they weren't, they were helping me work through my feelings and trying to give coping mechanisms) and what lies I was telling them (I wasn't) to make me hate her so much (I didn't, but boundaries equaled hate). \n\nYou're not alone, is what I'm trying to say. While what you discuss in sessions may be particular to your situation (race/ethnicity/religion included), how families can react to you getting help with therapy is pretty universal. Which sucks so much. Because you taking your own mental health in hand should not ever be a problem for anyone who loves you. But we're not there yet for so many of us.\n\nThey call it \"airing dirty laundry\" or whatever. It's \"shameful\" to speak of these things to strangers. That's absolutely what therapy is for - it's also why we come to Reddit. \n\nSo let her in or keep her out, that's up to you. If you think it might actually help you, go for it. If you think that she'll stop your progress, then don't. It is your decision. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "I would do it but it would be malicious compliance. I would tell the therapist ahead of time and of the plan. Refusing to say anything in the session and the therapist refusing to tell them anything by stating that they legally can't.", "she very clearly did something she doesn\u2019t want anyone to know about, but i\u2019m guessing op knows that already. nta, she\u2019s being very inappropriate, hold your ground.", "I am a health professional. When I was in training, my university had its own clinics. Students learning to become marriage and family therapists or clinical psychologists saw clients under the supervision of licensed psychologists. We charged very little (an average of $15 and I personally once charged as low as $2). I am in the USA. Wherever you live, google universities or other training programs and find out if they offer this. Also, if you happen to be in college, most have a counseling center and offer 8 to 10 free therapy sessions per semester. It is included in your tuition. Your grandmother is way out of line. Talk to your therapist about this. If your grandmother abused you, I do not recommend a family session. A family session with an abuser does not work. Stick to your individual therapy. Your therapist will give you referrals if you can no longer see him or her. Take care!"]}
