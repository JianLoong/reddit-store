There are three bedrooms/three bathrooms.  Me and Marie have an ensuite room, Emma's bathroom is in the hallway.\n\n \"We\" have a balcony.  To access it, there is a door in the living room (with a key that I used to leave in the lock) and a glass door in my bedroom.  My bedroom has a bay window on one side, with the door opening onto the balcony.  I have a curtain that hides the bedroom.  It is (in my lease) \"my\" balcony, the rent I pay is also higher than my flat mates. \n\nA month ago, Emma moved in during a weekend while I was away.  When I got home, I noticed that she was smoking and therefore using my balcony.  At that time, I didn't say anything to her as I'm quite shy and I wanted to avoid making a bad impression. \n\nEmma always smokes her first cigarette around 6 a.m., which constantly wakes me up because I leave the balcony door open while I sleep, she makes noise (playing music out loud) and the smell  of cigarette spreads in my room.  I also smoke, but waking up to the smell of cigarettes honestly gross me out.\n\nAnyway, Tuesday my shower broke down, Marie was on holidays.  Emma told me on Tuesday \"listen, tomorrow night you can use my bathroom, no problem, I won't be spending the night in the apartment anyway\".  So, on Wednesday when I got home from work I send her a message to confirm that she is ok that I use her bathroom.  She replies that no, she has changed her mind and is not comfortable with me using her private property (her exact words). \n\nEven if I can understand, it pissed me off because she had told me the day before that it was ok.  So I told her that from now on she can't use the balcony anymore because it's my private property, I pay more to have the balcony and she wakes me up almost every day.  I realize it's \"petty\" but I haven't said anything for weeks and keep letting her use the balcony even though it bothers me.\n\nShe was not happy at all and told me that I was a kid and should grow up.  According to her, a bathroom and a balcony are very different - I agree, but I pay more per month for the balcony and since she uses my balcony at all times, I always have to keep  my curtains shut to have privacy.  It's also very annoying when my boyfriend comes by, because with the balcony door open (the weather is really warm  so I need to leave it open) she can hear everything that's going on in my room.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about it, I think I'm within my rights and even if it's true that I \"take revenge\" a little, I've been letting her wake me up every morning for weeks.

However,  \"I also smoke, but waking up to the smell of cigarettes honestly gross me out.\" Then just f****** quit already because you do sound like a hypocrite.", "YTA for not establishing clear boundaries from the outset.", "ESH. She should be cool and let you use her bathroom. That's what a good roommate would do. Since it sounds like there's an entrance where everyone can access the balcony, it's not just your balcony. You may be paying more to have another door to it, but everyone still has a right to use it. The fact that you think it's only yours is ridiculous. I know what it's like to be shy, but if you had just had a talk with her about her early morning smoking habit, you could have worked out that issue. You're retaliating to her being shitty about the bathroom by being shitty about an issue that she didn't even know existed, and that's not fair to her. You could also have just closed your balcony door and opened your window. That would have been so simple.", "Nta\n\nYou should have stopped her when she started but was nice. She wasn\u2019t nice back so you felt no need to continue to be kind to an asshole. That makes you smart, not petty. \n\nNta", "I am a people pleaser and also very shy. I know, I should have told her from the start but I have a tendency on being very lenient. I also wanted to be nice as having a balcony made things easier for her (not having to go downstairs to smoke) and thought that was more important than my own well being. I opened my eyes when I realized that it wasn\u2019t reciprocal.", "The roommate is the one who smokes and op was the one denied a shower", "To clarify, I was given the key to the balcony when I signed my tenancy agreement. It is also written that the balcony and my bedroom are for my own private enjoyment. It is thus my key, and I only left it in the living room door as I was very close to my orevious flatmates and had told them \"you can use the balcony when I'm not in my bedroom\" which they always respected.\n\nEdit; also the estate agent did tell me that he told Emma that the balcony was mine. She never mentioned it/asked me about it and I wanted to be nice so I didn\u2019t say anything.", "If she pays more for the exclusive use of the balcony, she is within her rights not to share it!\n\nNTA.", "Yeah don\u2019t be so self sacrificing in the future. This person clearly doesn\u2019t seem to reciprocate your kindness.", "Emma is TA. \n\nIt would have been reasonable of her to ask you if it's okay that she uses your balcony to smoke when you are AWAKE and when you don't have your boyfriend over (because wanting extra privacy then is completely reasonable). \n\nIf she did it in the morning it would be common sense to not play music because she should think about you sleeping inside, so the fact that she does seems disrespectful and inconsiderate (she might not have realized the smoke smell bothers you since you also smoke). \n\nAnyhow, Emma did all this without even asking which is a little \"forward\" not in a good way, but if she is that kind of open-to-sharing communal kind of person (some people are) then she certainly wouldn't object to letting you use her bathroom in a time of need. That shows she isn't just a communal kind of person but an asshole. \n\nIt is kind of hard to grasp how Emma functions really. Was she aware the balcony was yours? If she wasn't that explains some of it (although still inconsiderate with the loud music in the mornings). Regardless, not lending you her bathroom makes her an asshole anyway.", "If you were direct with her before. She would have no problem in sharing her bathroom. \n\nThis is from personal experience as an expeople pleaser. When I started being direct about my greiviances in a polite manner. People were more amiable to share.", "Also, if you've been reasonable in the run up you have so much more ammunition in the argument they provoked by being a selfish tit. That justified anger is the good stuff. \n\nSeems we have similar MO's op, but different reasons why.", "Still, ESH. Even if it's supposed to just be yours, you opened the public access to it. Even though there were rules to using it, those rules weren't discussed with her, and that's on you. Should have just talked to her about it and made it clear that if she doesn't stop, then she loses the privilege to use your balcony. You were trying to be nice, but because of how you responded to her slight against you, all you did was create even more drama than you were probably trying to avoid.", "Nah, even if it's supposed to just be hers, she willingly gave everyone access to it. Even though there were rules to using the balcony, those rules weren't discussed with the new roommate, and that's on OP. She's obviously within her rights to not share it, but since she just took that access away without talking to her new roommate, ESH.", "This isn\u2019t an easement type of situation, it is a space that she legally has exclusive access to in a contract. \n\nIt is likely that the balcony belonging to one tenant is in the roommate\u2019s rental agreement. \n\nIt is possible to allow someone to use something that is yours and then decide not to let them use it anymore for whatever reason. \n\nHave you ever let a friend sleep on your sofa? Is that person entitled to live at your house in perpetuity since you allowed them to use it?", "Obviously someone sleeping on a friend's sofa shouldn't assume they're allowed to stay there forever, but if you don't want them there anymore, you sit down and have a talk with them. You don't just change the locks or take their key. Considering OP is going to see her roommate and be around her from time to time, talking to her would have been the right move. Not doing so created even more unneeded drama and frustration than there already was.", "OP did talk to their roommate tho? It seems she was trying to communicate very well actually, because by your own views she already had permission to use the other roommates restroom and then when she was polite enough to reiterate if it was allowed (something the roommate has NEVER done with the balcony anyways) the roommate decided to tell OP who doesn\u2019t currently have a working shower that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing her personal property and space. So therefore OP communicated that if they weren\u2019t on a reciprocal level of being able to help each other by allowing them into their personal spaces, the roommate is also no longer allowed in OP\u2019s space. It was all communicated, it\u2019s not like OP just took the key out of the door and started leaving the balcony locked", "a bathroom is different from a balcony. very different. a bathroom is essential. nta, your timing was bad but why would you want to do her any favors after this?", "NTA", "NTA- I saw you post that you were a people pleaser.  There gets to be a point where you have to stop doing that.  You will have your own responsibilities that make it impossible like this given situation.\n\nYou've inconvenienced yourself on her behalf, She has shown she does not care to do the same for you.   So you do not order anything.  \nWhy put up with annoyances for someone who wouldn't do the same for you?\n\nThere does get to be a point when you do stop people pleasing, and some of those friends will disappear.  It is because those friends are there only because of resources and help freely given.\n\nYou will be sad, It will still be hard.  But you will be better off.", "NTA- cant you swap rooms?", "Nta but you need to better deal with your conflict management issues, it looks like you play tit for tat and I would be annoyed with you. You should have said before the washroom issue her using the balcony was disturbing your enjoyment of your room. I could see from her perspective how it come off as childish but in the end you were well within your rights to deny her access.", "NTA  You made the right decision.", "NTA\u2026 you get what you dish out. Don\u2019t back down", "For what, she pays extra for the balcony it\u2019s her space not shared NTA", "If she doesnt use balcony she gets cheaper room and roommate who smokes get balcony and doesnt disturb her and pays more for room with balcony. Obviously."]}
