You need to make your own judgments, not just listen to your mom without question. And in this case your judgment was to let your mom give your infant alcohol. Does that sound trustworthy to you?", "YTA, yeah.\n\nI mean, you know alcohol is unsafe.  It also happens not to work as a topical analgesic; if the baby quietens down, it's because of the general sedative effect of alcohol.\n\nI think it's hilarious how your mother conflates the use of a well-understood but completely inappropriate drug with 'herbs and natural healing'.", "NTA\n\nYou made a bad judgment call here, and a lot of people are going to come charging in on their high horses to tell you what a horrible mother you are like they've never messed up before. Don't worry about them. You're a first-time mom, so you're naturally gonna listen to your own mother when she tries to give you advice. It's natural to look to our elders for guidance and to trust them.\n\nWhile many mothers (including my own) have used this method, we know a lot more about these older \"tried and true\" remedies these days. Most of them never worked how they were intended to, if at all. If you wanted something more natural, there are plenty of herbs that you could talk to your daughter's doctor about. If you just let your daughter's doctor know that you want something along those lines, they should be able to point you in the right direction.\n\nYou're not some monster that's going to harm your child. Honestly, if this is how your husband is reacting, that's a red flag. He's right, it doesn't relieve pain, and if you were to start doing it regularly, yeah, it can be harmful. However, it was a one-time thing that you told him about, and now you know not to do it again. He shouldn't be acting like it was a conspiracy to intentionally hurt your daughter.\n\nThe best course of action is to be mature adults about this and have some open communication among the three of you (you, him, and your mother). Your mother needs to understand that this is a new boundary. He needs to understand that parents make mistakes, and it doesn't do anyone any good to become extreme in such a way. You need to understand to look into things before applying them to your child so that this (or something worse) doesn't happen to your child.\n\nI hope this situation is handled well and that all of you can find yourself in a better situation of clearer understanding and progress.", "Dang. Soft YTA. You're going to get all kinds of opinions on whether the alcohol was a good or bad choice, but I actually don't think it matters either way. Your husband was uncomfortable with a parenting choice you made. Something like this should have been discussed with the other parent before you decided to try it. He has a right to be upset, but it seems like he might be taking it a little too far. \n\nIMO one of two things is happening here. Either your husband is completely overreacting and trying to hurt you by acting as if you are unfit, or this is something that has happened before where you coparent with your mom and make decisions without him. \n\nEither way, I would say talk to your husband and make decisions with him about your child, and be weary of \"old fashioned\" baby things. Modern research tells us so much. Every parent can make their own choices, but make them with your child's other parent, not your mom.", "This is something my MIL did for her two oldest kids back in the 60's, but alcohol is proven to be harmful for babies.  She also dropped out of high school...\n\nThere are non-alcoholic, over-the-counter, pain rub for teething babies.\n\nYTA", "Gentle YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re 28, you have your own child and YOU are responsible for their well being. A quick google search would have told you this probably wasn\u2019t the best idea. \n\nI understand your husband completely and you should respect the boundary he has set until he feels comfortable again.", "YTA, you should've discussed it with your partner first, especially since the remedy actually might be harmful to the child.\n\nAnd honestly, you shouldn't even be using alcohol on a baby, go to a doctor or just get some numbing cream for babies.", "Oh wow.  Talk about an over-reaction on your husband's part.  He banned your child from your mom's house and took 2 days off work to supervise you with your own child.  Again, wow.   \n\nThe whiskey-on-the-gums thing is a questionable practice and shouldn't be done, but it's not like trying it once will cause irreparable damage.  You know now that it was ineffective and just not a good idea.  In the course of raising this child, you will both make parenting mistakes, plenty of them - I guarantee it.  And you aren't the first parents to find that your own parents practiced techniques that have since proven to be bad ideas.  The response shouldn't be to ban your parents from your child, but rather to update your parents on current practices.  \n\nAnd NTA,  but you and your husband definitely need to find a better way of dealing with the differences in parenting styles and choices that you will undoubtedly encounter over the next couple decades.", "YTA\n\nNext time you want to try homeopathic remedies on your child, talk to your partner first.  You both must agree, or the answer is no.", "YTA.\n\nUm, don\u2019t give your 6 month old alcohol? Doctors practice and study this stuff for a reason. I understand, you\u2019re a new mom and made a mistake but it's common sense to seek a doctor if something seems wrong with either you or your kid\n\nSeems a bit fair he would be paranoid considering he is a new father as well.", "I'm sure I'll be downvoted for this, given the number of Y T A responses, but I'm going with NTA. This is a well known old wives' trick; my mom did it, and so have a lot of others across the years. As other people mentioned, the reason it works isn't because it's relieving the pain, but because you're making the baby a wee bit tipsy, something that we understand a bit better now than when your mom was raising you. You made a judgement call that you probably wouldn't make again, as all parents sometimes do. I think your husband is being absurd, though, unless you have a history of making much worse errors in parenting.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe people are saying otherwise. \n\nThis is common practice in the south in the US, my father did this to me and all of my siblings. It was also done to him and all of his siblings. \n\nBtw 2 of us have our masters (plus liberal arts colleges in NE for undergrad) and the other went to an IVY. We\u2019re all in great physical health too, I just ran the Boston marathon last year. It clearly did not affect us physically or mentally in any negative way. \n\nI\u2019ve had a doctor in Mass tell me to drink some whiskey if I wanted my cold to go away faster (they\u2019re an instructor at Harvard). People need to get over themselves this is not the same as drugging your child.", "I\u2019ll say NTA for turning to a seasoned adult, but definitely do your own research about what is acceptable now. \n\nShoot, orajel isn\u2019t recommended anymore because it\u2019s believed to make the gums harder for the teeth to pop through and that was being widely used not even 10 years ago. Get teething rings, rub a cold cloth on her gums, those will help. Talk to your pediatrician. Don\u2019t just blindly follow anyone else.", "NTA. You\u2019re a new time mom! You\u2019re going to make a lot of mistakes. There\u2019s going to people calling you horrible, dumb, etc and act like they\u2019ve never made not even one mistake their entire life. \n\nIt\u2019s a natural thing to listen to your mom because your still new at being a mom and because she has experience with you and your siblings (if you have any). \n\nYou and your siblings turned out fine. There are a lot of old remedies that are good and a lot that are bad. It\u2019s just a matter of experimenting or asking someone older than you about it and what the outcome was. To me it sounds like this one was one of the good ones but you can never be too sure about it.", "NTA, since your a new Mom and going off of what your Mom was taught and did. \n\nPeople have been dipping a finger in booze and rubbing it on baby's gums since the 1800. Unfortunately, it doesn't sooth the pain associated with teething. It just makes babies sleepy. My grandma did it with her kids and grandkids. \n\nTo all the YTA sayers you're over reacting like her husband. It wasn't a shot of whiskey, it's less than a drop. Now she knows to avoid it in the future if she chooses.", "NTA. You\u2019re a first time parent. We all make mistakes. I\u2019ve taken advice from my elders, too, because whatever they did worked to some extent. When you\u2019re in the moment and frustrated because of a fussy baby\u2026. Yeah, you might not make the brightest decision. \n\nBut your husband is blowing this waaaay out of proportion. This may not be divorce worthy, we would probably separate for a while over that. Does he even do his share of taking care of the baby?\n\n\nEdit: changed my judgment.", "Nta just a little naive. Your husband calling  out for two days though? That's weird.", "It's definitely no longer recommended so I'd say don't do it/let anyone else do it again. Folk remedies take a long time to die out even if they're unsafe so your mum probably thought nothing of it but now you know better you can both do better next time. Annesol or cold frozen flannels can be helpful for a teething baby along with keeping on top of pain relief", "I guess I\u2019d say ESH. Letting your mom put whiskey on your baby\u2019s gums was dumb. Your husband is also severely overreacting. The amount of alcohol your baby was exposed to was minimal, it\u2019s not going to have any lasting impact, and it\u2019s ridiculous to act like neither you nor your mother can ever be along with the baby again. Newsflash: parents make mistakes. Your husband will make one too. You should be educating yourselves and being careful, but also learning to deal kindly with the mishaps they come up.", "Personally, I wouldn't do this with my daughter, who is three months old and has already started teething. My daughter has teething toys that go in the fridge, and once cooled, she can use them to chew on. \n\nSure, when we were kids, our parents did use alcohol as that was the 'norm', but it really isn't safe. My health visitor (I'm UK based) has even advised against using any types of gels - just calpol and toys. \n\nDid your husband react in the best way? Probably not. Was your Mum trying to help after hearing the struggles you and baby are going through and did her best to help? Yes. Did it work? Yes.\n\nBest thing to do? Take this as a learning experience and move on - maybe not do the whole alcohol thing again. If he continues to act like a helicopter parent, call him out on it and leave the teething baby with him for the day and give yourself a rest. Taking care of a baby is goddam hard. Maybe this will give him some perspective that you were trying your best and needed that quick fix. \n\nFor that reason, NTA.", "Soft YTA it doesnt help.  If you child has started to try food,  you can give them banana ice-cream.  It is just mushed banana frozen and then mixed until it looks like ice-cream.   A teaspoon can cool the gums and give relief.    \n\nThis what my  doctor told me to do and I trust Swedish doctors.   \n\n\nMy husband  mum did the same when it comes to whisky,  my husband didnt sleep that day, constant crying and  being  super fussy, So next kid, she didnt do it at all.", "ESH. Look I\u2019m not gonna mom shame. Too many people do that because they\u2019re filled with hate. But you\u2019re not actually helping the teething, your child is just getting a little buzzed on alcohol which makes them feel less pain (think of all the dumb guys that smash bottles over their heads when they\u2019re drunk, cut themselves open and don\u2019t even know). I personally would look into other options such as frozen fruits (you freeze them onto a popsicle stick and let them suck away) or other child friendly medicines. \n\nYour husband however needs to take a step back, this wasn\u2019t malicious or intended to harm. He\u2019s throwing guilt on you and judgement that is frankly unnecessary. I think you both need to sit down and talk about this just you two, LISTEN to each other and maybe have a list of acceptable treatments you both agree with in the future.", "As I recall, rubbing alcohol on a baby\u2019s gums when teething was somewhat normal in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s (and maybe even after that).  Worked like a charm, I\u2019m told.  I assumed it had a numbing effect but apparently it actually gets the kid slightly inebriated so they don\u2019t notice the pain.  Luckily, along came Anbesol and no more need to get the kid buzzed.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d say NTA.  You assumed your mother had some clue about what she was doing, she had used that technique on you and you (presumably) are no worse for the experience and it is unlikely to have caused any permanent damage.  Probably should try some other non-alcoholic remedy in the future though.", "NTA, what the hell do you think our parents did to us and their parents did to them? \nWe haven't popped our clogs! This is why people call the last two generations snowflakes!", "While you should have had better judgement, I think folks need to put down their pitchforks on this one. \n\nNTA for turning to your mom and letting her try something that her generation (and ones before) did. \n\nSpecific to your husband: I get being upset, but taking time off work to watch you? Unless you\u2019ve had severe lapses in judgement before this, I don\u2019t see why he\u2019s reacting this way.\n\nIf you have continual severe judgement lapses or continue to use Jack as mommy\u2019s little helper, THEN you\u2019d be the A H.", "NTA (though that would change if you continued to do this)\n\nProbably not the wisest move, but overall I don't think this will hurt your baby.  People have done this for centuries, and babies managed to survive. It's one of those things that is discouraged, now, though.  Your husband has a right to request that no one rub whiskey on his baby's gums, though it is significantly overstepping to forbid you from visiting your own mother.   It's also not really fair if you are a first-time parent left alone all day that he is expecting you to somehow magically know how to handle every situation.\n\nGo purchase some actual stuff for teething, or talk to your doctor.", "YTA, you should've discussed it with your partner first, especially since the remedy actually might be harmful to the child.", "NTA - this has been a thing for a long ass time. LONG long time. Ironically, it worked didn\u2019t it? This technique is only weird and unknown for people under 30.", "A lot of parents do this, not just your mom. So your child is neither the first nor last grandchild to get whisky on the gums. If your husband is very controlling and often tries to hurt/guilt you over simple mistakes, you don\u2019t deserve that.", "To all the neurotic helicopter \"parents\", the amount of alcohol applied would likely be trace at best. Get over it.", "Nta. A drop of alcohol is not gonna harm the baby. And your husband's reaction is overblown", "INFO Why not just buy orajel or one of the other teething numbing agents? Yeah in the 50s people used to do that but it doesn't really help. If anything it just knocks the kid out and you can get the same effect from over the counter teething meds and/or baby aspirin. Once isn't going to have a lasting effect but it makes sense that your husband is upset be cause you should know there are other options.", "YTA. Your mother did an unsafe thing. What's next -- will she put the baby to sleep on its tummy because that's what they did when you were young?\n\nSafety standards change, and people who care for infants need to follow the best, most recent advice.", "NAH\n\nBut I do think the YTA votes screaming about poisoning are overreacting incredibly and a lot of you probably had it done to you as a baby. \n\nA few drops on the gums once isn't going to harm the baby. That being said, is it an old teething remedy that should be left in the past? Yes. There are much better safer methods nowadays.", "NTA. Your husband has some issues. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck with him.", "YTA.  There are MANY harmless teething options.  You chose to let your mother put poison in your child's system. A little whiskey will calm anyone down. Giving your baby happy hour to calm the pain of teething is one of the oldest and worst ways to go about it. Next time bring teething rings and orajel.", "They have medicine for teething pain. So get that.\n\nAlcohol is frowned upon. Avoid giving kids booze. But you didn't actually hurt your kid this time. \n\nYour husband is a controlling abusive jerk and you need to seriously watch out. He is not your boss. He doesn't get to order you around or dictate you or your mother and the fact he is babysitting YOU is deeply concerting. (I'd personally divorce a guy that acts like him, but that's me)", "Can\u2019t believe that an almost 30 year old needs to be told not to give whiskey to a baby but here we are. 9/10 doctors don\u2019t prefer a certain brand of cigarette anymore either.", "I\u2019ve definitely used whiskey on a toothache to help with pain while waiting to see the dentist (it works) but I wouldn\u2019t use it on a baby.", "NAH\n\nIt's the application of alcohol as a topical anesthetic.  It's not like you were doing shots with the kid.  Definitely something that both parents need to be on board with, but IIRC (youngest is now 7, so it's been a minute) any kind of numbing cream etc was to be avoided as we were told it would somehow make the gums tougher and draw out the whole process.\n\nLet the little one chew on a clean facecloth that's been dampened with ice water, maybe tie a knot in it if they need something to really gnaw on.\n\n1st time parents... cut yourselves some slack and stop looking at all of the \"parenting\" info online.

First time moms make mistakes sometimes, and whiskey on the gums ONE TIME is not going to do any long term damage, so don\u2019t beat yourself up. With that said, please try Orajel and Tylenol. it\u2019s much safer for the babes. Your husband is overreacting, but in the future you should be on the same page about treatment options. \n\nAlso ice chips and frozen fruit pur\u00e9es are really great at this age!

One time is not going to harm your baby, but are much safer remedies available.\n\nThat said, I think your husband is massively overreacting by banning you from taking your daughter to your mom\u2019s and watching you every moment. Agreeing not to do it again should be sufficient.\n\nESH", "NTA. Dabbing a bit of whiskey on your finger and gently rubbing the gums is in no way harmful. The baby isn't going to get drunk or have any \"damage.\" More often than not, it is the last resort teething and not a constant.

I sympathize with both of you, and I hope this is just a learning experience you can look back on later with a little laugh. You\u2019re home with a baby who won\u2019t stop screaming and you want to help.
