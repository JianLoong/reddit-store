And is still brought up by my family to make me look stupid when I, in fact, am correct.\r  \n\r  \nSo, when I was 16 I was living with my dad and my stepmom. I have two younger half-siblings that are theirs. One night we were going somewhere and they asked me to help my little brother (3 at the time) get dressed in the outfit they picked out for them. They'd picked out a pair of cowboy boots for him, but a pair of straight-cut jeans, not bootcut. So, I tucked his jeans into his boots. My stepmom then yelled at me to not tuck his jeans in because quote \"he's not a girl\".\r  \n\r  \nNow, for context, I only moved in with my dad and stepmom when I was 12, and I'm originally from an extremely rural area in the American southwest. Out in ranch country. So in my hometown, cowboy boots are standard everyday wear and I am very familiar with what I guess you could call \"boot etiquette\" and gender doesn't play a role in it at all. If you're wearing bootcut jeans, your jeans should be outside your boots. If you're wearing any other kind of jeans, they should be tucked in or you'll look stupid.\r  \n\r  \nSo, I asked, \"what does that have to do with being a girl?\" My dad rolled his eyes at me and said \"don't start that shit\", as if I was trying to start a gender debate. I wasn't, I was just genuinely confused because I had literally never heard that before in my life. I tried to explain my logic to them, but they brushed me off entirely.\r  \n\r  \nSo, in current day, I was recently at a family event where my dad and stepmom were present and they told this story so they could laugh at me for how \"stupid\" I was being about the boots thing. This seriously pissed me off and I'll admit, I kind of flew off the handle. I yelled at them both about where I come from, how I wore cowboy boots every day and worked on a ranch and my jeans were never tucked into my boots because I was wearing bootcut. I told them that neither of them know what the hell they're talking about, that I know more than them, and they're the stupid ones. My stepmom started crying and my dad and I screamed at each other for a bit before I eventually stormed out.\r  \n\r  \nNow I have family members blowing up my phone saying I was way out of line and ruined the night for everyone. I still feel that I'm right on principle, but that maybe I overreacted at the time.

If at 21 this is the type of story they're telling at parties it's more than likely they've always put you down and no kid deserves that from his parents,  step or natural. Nta.

And that even if you're right, the people around where they live will still look at his tucked in boots and think \"that's how girls wear them.\" But you didn't say where they live so I'm not sure, but it's just a thought.\n\nYou should also really think how they were poking fun at you. If it was just some teasing, then you could have probably leaned back, smiled, and then cracked a joke right back at them. I know its difficult with parents because they have a way of pushing buttons, but not everything  is worth a fight. Just a thought.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
