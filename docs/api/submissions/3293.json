We have two kids under 3 and it\u2019s exhausting. I am primarily a stay at home Mom with some side gigs. He works in recruiting for a big organization. We are 32F and 34M. We share household chores but I primarily do the laundry.\n\nSo onto the problem\u2026 the majority of my husband\u2019s clothing doesn\u2019t go in the dryer, but he has some that does. This has been a sticking point for us for years. I have ADHD and poor working memory so it\u2019s like a horrible game show where someone tells you to sort out objects without there being any pattern or reasoning behind it other than this shirt is older and these jeans are newer etc. It\u2019s confusing and I have tried to figure out which is which but inevitably mistakes happen and things end up in the dryer. When they do he gets upset and is sad because the clothing shrinks and doesn\u2019t fit properly. For further context my husband has a hard time finding clothing that fit him, he\u2019s tall and fit but has a small waist so if it fits in the arms and length it is usually too wide, if it fits in the waist it\u2019s too tight in the arms. He also hates shopping for clothes so when he buys clothing he keeps it for a long time.\n\nAbout a year ago I accidentally put one of my husband\u2019s favourite sweatshirts in the dryer on high heat and it shrunk. He was sad and so I apologized and I came up with the solution of using mesh washing bags for his clothing that doesn\u2019t go in the dryer and went out and bought them for him. I told him to put anything he didnt want dried into the bags and he told me that he would do it.\n\nFast-forward a couple months and he hadn\u2019t bothered to do it and another shirt got dryered . I reminded him of the bags again. He said he\u2019d do it and he didn\u2019t again. This went on for months with many different excuses.\n\nAbout two months ago when we all were sick I was doing laundry. I was trying to sort the clothes out and my youngest threw up on me. So I shoved everything that was still clean in the dryer. I put the heat on low then folded everything like normal and he never said anything. Never said anything fit tight or felt like it had shrunk. I felt like I had gotten away with murder and assumed I could just keep doing it.\n\nFast forward to today and he decided to fold the laundry. He noticed his nice Merino Wool base layer in the dryer and said \u201cyou put my merino base layer in the dryer?\u201d And I said \u201cI put everything in the dryer on low now\u201d and he was immediately upset and said it was ruined. I said \u201cI have been putting everything in the dryer for a couple months. I gave you the mesh bags a year and you never used them. So I gave up and started putting everything in the dryer.\u201d Then I said if he \u201cwants his laundry to be done a certain way then he needs to sort it before it goes in the wash or do it himself.\u201d He had only a sarcastic response for me and he made it clear he thinks I\u2019m TA. So Reddit, am I the asshole for putting my husband\u2019s clothes in the dryer?", "created_utc": 1669484440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5d6kb/aita_for_putting_my_husbands_merino_wool_clothing/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Ignoring the part that you offered him another solution that he doesn\u2019t want to accept)\n\nEdit: you need to tell him \u201cdear husband, I\u2019ve decided I no longer can do you laundry. The stress of accidentally shrinking your shirts is adding to my already huge mental load.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nI would sort all his clothes out of the laundry completely and only wash my own and my kid\u2019s.

You came up with a very easy solution of him separating out what can\u2019t be dried and he refused to use it. Honestly you should just stop doing his laundry if he is going to act like an ungrateful child", "NTA!!! I love my lululemon things and don\u2019t usually splurge. So guess what I do!? I wash them! Jfc!", "NTA. He knows you\u2019re struggling to remember but doesn\u2019t seem to do much about it. He\u2019s an adult, he can either do his own laundry or send it out for dry cleaning.", "NTA. Your husband is acting like a big toddler expecting everyone to bow to his little perfect world. I\u2019d also say that he has no interest in understanding ADHD.\n\nMy situation was different in that my DH just wanted his stuff to be the same color coming out as it was going in. When we married I was 20 and he was 24. I\u2019m an only child. He is the last of 4 boys. My dad and I raised cattle and hogs. I did ALL the chores as Dad also worked full time built was on the road from Sunday night to Friday afternoons. That made me his working farm hand & \u201cson\u201d plus Moms daughter who hated dresses. I\u2019ve always been a hardcore tomboy. When Mom said it was time to do laundry or wash dishes I bailed every time fleeing to the barns to piddle around with the little pigs or work with the adult cows making them my friends. \n\nWhen we married I literally did not know how to use a clothes washer or dryer. I understood how to wash dishes but that was it. Used wayyyy too much dish soap those early years, lol. The laundry tho? All our socks were either blue or pink depending on what got thrown in to wash. I shrunk a sport jacket he was gifted to wear as a pallbearer as I had no knowledge of wool. I was also never diagnosed with ADHD until I turned 50. They thought I had SADD instead so I was a frantic topic changing short-attention-spanned hot mess. He got sick of his closet he\u2019s getting F\u2019d up so he took over washing all of his own closures and taught our 3 kids to do the same so i didn\u2019t unintentionally destroy their clothes too. Now I\u2019m medicated, laid back like a broken beach chair, happier than I\u2019ve ever been and I do all our laundry now. \n\nI know this was long but it shows how my man worked around my weirdo brain and took care of business. It should give you a vision of how your man is not stepping up yo the plate.", "NTA. When I was newly married, my husband didn't like it that I rolled socks and didn't fold them.

If he's not willing to use the bags you got, and if nothing shrank on the low setting, he doesn't have much to complain about. Do let him do his own laundry from now on!", "NTA", "NTA You came up with a great solution with the mesh bags and he\u2019s obviously too lazy to use them. I\u2019m the one in our house who doesn\u2019t want a lot of things in the dryer, so it\u2019s my responsibility to keep up with it.", "NTA. You gave him a solution which he refused to try. I\u2019d simply tell him he\u2019s on his own now for laundry. \n\nI\u2019m very fussy about how mine is done. I live alone so no issues. But if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d still do my own as that way it gets done how I want it", "NTA. You came up with a workable solution that he agreed to.

Maybe I\u2019m petty but I wouldn\u2019t touch his laundry anymore, you shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells while doing something for someone else, let alone in your own house.\n\nMy bf and I live together and usually do laundry separately, but when we do throw our stuff in together, I\u2019m always the one to swap things from washer to dryer so I can fish out my sweaters and more delicate clothes so I can lay them flat to dry. It\u2019s my hang up, so I take care of it. It\u2019s the least labor intensive part of laundry and the least your husband can do if he\u2019s so bent out of shape over this. Or just do his own", "NTA\n\nYou tried to find solutions, he kept reproducing the problems.\n\nLooking for one or two items that don't go in the dryer is a PITA. Let him do his own laundry, so it is always done right.", "NTA. You provided a perfect solution and reminded him of it and he couldn't be bothered.

Jeez.", "I work 55+ hour weeks. My husband is a stay at home parent to 2 kids. Do you know who does my laundry? Me. Because my husband isn't my servant. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou gave him options, he didn't use the bags. So the merino ended up in the dryer. Look, I know a bit about fabrics and most (natural) fabrics shrink in a dryer. It's the way the fibers are.(unless you have a cold option for synthectics). Natural fabrics like cotton and wool need to be dried naturally, on a rack. But, if your husbands merino wool jumpers are *very* expensive, I would bring them to a DryCleaner. \n\nAnother option would be either to buy cheaper clothes, or let him take care of his own (expensive) clothes.\n\nYou're doing the best you can...", "NTA. \n\n\u201cI felt like I had gotten away with murder and assumed..\u201d bordered on being TA, however you had previously come up with a solution that he didn\u2019t feel like putting in the effort to use. Yet he wanted you to remember his system that doesn\u2019t seem consistent (either all or none of the jeans go in the dryer, etc)\n\nHe needs to either use the bags, allow things to be dried, or he just needs to do his laundry himself!", "NTA. Your husband won\u2019t use the bags, you keep shrinking his clothes. The only solution is for him to dry his laundry. He can wash and dry it, or you can wash it and leave it to him to dry. No more problems.", "never dry anything on high for God sakes!\n\nlemme ask - had you already dried the merino thing on low in the past and it was fine??  but because he SAW it in the dryer this time, he was saying it was ruined?\n\nbecause i made chili once with ground turkey, which \u201cmakes my husband sick\u201d according to him. i didn\u2019t tell him it was turkey and he enjoyed the hell out of it.  sometimes it\u2019s all in their head. \n\nif so, then do his clothes when he\u2019s not around. \n\nif it actually DID shrink on low, forget the damn bag.  my husbands clothes don\u2019t even make it into the hamper, he\u2019s just not gonna use the bag (i mean you could continue to point out that it\u2019s his fault, but that\u2019s unnecessary negative energy  in the house)\n\njust take what Cannot go in the dryer and put a few stitches of red thread on the label.  that way a quick look will keep them outta there. \n\noh and NTA now that you\u2019ve stopped using the High setting", "NTA. \n\nYou offered a reasonable compromise and he refused to go along with it.\n\nAnd to all of those folks saying OP should read the tags? First, a lot of folks cut the tags out. Second, a person caring for two kids under three is lucky to have the time to DO the laundry at all, much less look at every label on a grown man\u2019s clothing when he has refused to take one additional step to make the process simpler.", "NTA. Shit like this happens. If he\u2019s so particular and going to be critical, he should be washing his own clothes. He\u2019s a grown man.", "NTA.\n\nHe should do the laundry himself or come up with a solution that he can stick to.", "NTA.

You are a saint for even thinking you might be TA here. Tell him to do his own laundry if it has special requirements.", "NTA.  A solution was offered and he refused.  I'm so glad I don't give a shit about this kid of thing..in the washer, in the dryer and then in the dresser/closet.", "NTA, accidents happen and you have a lot on your plate right now. Having two small children is exhausting and that's before you add in any housework. \nAs a suggestion: why don't get your husband to take photos of his clothes that can't go into the dryer and stick them on the wall by the washing machine. \n\nAlternatively, tell him to do his own laundry.", "NTA.

My daughters are I are more particular about our clothes (separate colors, some things on delicate cycles) and my husband isn\u2019t.

You came up with a solution so that his clothes wouldn\u2019t get ruined, these are also a bit more expensive so I understand him being upset the first time but since he kept doing it it\u2019s on him. Another solution is for him to do all his own laundry. I\u2019m particular about my clothes so I don\u2019t allow anyone else to do laundry in our house, that\u2019s a chore allocated solely to me.

My husband puts things in his pockets, nails, screws, etc. I never put things in my pockets so it never occurs to me to check before they go in the washer.

I\u2019d say from now on he needs to do his own laundry", "NTA. If he's worried about things being shrunk, he can do his own laundry", "NTA My husband does most of the laundry and is particular about how he dries his clothes. When I help with the laundry, it\u2019s towels, sheets or just my stuff.", "NTA for this reason I wash my own clothes (and our sons) and my husband washes his. It was the best problem solver \ud83d\ude0a. He gets to wash and fold his clothes at his leisure (he's fast I take my time and forever folding lol) and no more arguments!", "NTA.  You offered a very reasonable solution.  If he can\u2019t be bothered to sort his stuff, why should he expect you to?

He takes responsibility for washing and managing his own clothes and it\u2019s never been a point of contention. Your husband is more than capable of doing his own laundry. You gave him an opportunity to use washing bags and he couldn\u2019t be bothered. Let him do it himself", "NTA OP! I have ADHD also, my husband has stronger preferences for laundry so he just does our laundry, (and I do other chores that he doesn\u2019t like.) maybe a similar setup would make more sense so you aren\u2019t responsible for his laundry!", "NTA, he had ample opportunity to make sure his non-dryer clothes would stay out of the dryer. He didn't want to do that. So either he needs to do his own laundry or deal with the fact that clothes end up in the dryer.", "NTA he needs to separate them or label them or something.  Your bag solution was fine.", "NTA.  My husband has ADHD/memory issues and is also usually responsible for the laundry.  A lot of my clothes shouldn't go in the dryer, so we worked out a system so it's easy for him to get it done without having to remember to check all of the tags every time.  We also have a toddler, so I know that carefully checking tags and sorting things every time isn't always possible anyway.\n\nYou offered your husband a reasonable solution, and he decided he was too lazy to follow it.

Get meds, do CBT. Surely you can read a label. Will ADHD be the excuse for giving your kids the wrong dose of meds? I know a sweater is not a child. But it seems maybe you need better strategies for your ADHD. And I say this as a 44F with ADHD so I know the struggle is real.", "NTA- he has options for making sure his stuff doesn't get thrown in the dryer and he's not taking them. You're also finding out his wool clothes aren't ruined by  drying them the way you are.", "Nta I'm a tall person and put everything in the drier on low as my solution to prevent things from shrinking too", "Nta. Maybe a separate laundry bag for him? so HIS and HER laundry bags? \n\nMy husband is particular with his gym clothes and pants too.\n\nI usually do 2 separate loads of laundry, my 3 kids clothes separately, and my husband\u2019s and mine clothes separately. That way it\u2019s easier to sort and the load is smaller. \n\nMy kids ones, I just dump them all in the dryer without sorting. \n\nOur clothes, I check each piece of clothing before I put them in the dryer. Regular clothes in the dryer, gym clothes I air dry.", "ESH\n\nHe needs to use the bags you need to read the clothing labels.\n\nYall are supposed to be a team start acting like one.", "ESH.  Your husband socks for not using the mesh bags, but you suck for not checking the care label.  I imagine anything merino wool will say to hang dry.  No remembering required - when in doubt check the label", "ESH - neither of you seem to want to make much effort to resolve this. Your husband could easily have done the washing himself or at least used the mesh bags, as he agreed to. But for you - ADHD or not, it\u2019s not that hard to just check the labels of things before you dry them if you\u2019ve forgotten whether they dry or not; and if you don\u2019t want to do that, then it\u2019s also easy to just leave your husband\u2019s clothes aside for him to sort out and dry himself when he gets home. Giving up and tumble drying everything instead of just admitting that you made another mistake is passive aggressive nonsense.\n\nBut the real solution here is just to buy clothes that wash the same as all the other clothes. My family had a \u201cnothing that needs ironing\u201d rule while I was growing up, and if we broke it we did our own ironing but otherwise my mum did the laundry. This stuff isn\u2019t hard to work out unless both sides are haggling over a very minimal amount of work. You\u2019ve probably both wasted more energy on arguing about this for months than it would have taken to just fix the issue.", "ESH.

Save energy and stop destroying clothes; line dry everything.", "ESH. Your solution of mesh bags was excellent. Your husband shot himself in the foot by not using them, but you are incredibly inconsiderate to decide to put all the clothes in the dryer.

I suffer ADHD too, but I know enough about laundry (m50) to understand that not everything goes in the dryer on high heat, or low, or medium. We had a dryer in our building that would shrink clothes no matter what. Jeans were shrinking, shirts were shrinking, and at first, we thought, meh, we're getting fat. But then stuff that were two sizes too big started getting smaller. Started using the dryer on low, and it stopped. The tags say how stuffs gotta be cleaned. Follow the tags.

We have two kids under 3 and it\u2019s exhausting. I am primarily a stay at home Mom with some side gigs. He works in recruiting for a big organization. We are 32F and 34M. We share household chores but I primarily do the laundry.\n\nSo onto the problem\u2026 the majority of my husband\u2019s clothing doesn\u2019t go in the dryer, but he has some that does. This has been a sticking point for us for years. I have ADHD and poor working memory so it\u2019s like a horrible game show where someone tells you to sort out objects without there being any pattern or reasoning behind it other than this shirt is older and these jeans are newer etc. It\u2019s confusing and I have tried to figure out which is which but inevitably mistakes happen and things end up in the dryer. When they do he gets upset and is sad because the clothing shrinks and doesn\u2019t fit properly. For further context my husband has a hard time finding clothing that fit him, he\u2019s tall and fit but has a small waist so if it fits in the arms and length it is usually too wide, if it fits in the waist it\u2019s too tight in the arms. He also hates shopping for clothes so when he buys clothing he keeps it for a long time.\n\nAbout a year ago I accidentally put one of my husband\u2019s favourite sweatshirts in the dryer on high heat and it shrunk. He was sad and so I apologized and I came up with the solution of using mesh washing bags for his clothing that doesn\u2019t go in the dryer and went out and bought them for him. I told him to put anything he didnt want dried into the bags and he told me that he would do it.\n\nFast-forward a couple months and he hadn\u2019t bothered to do it and another shirt got dryered . I reminded him of the bags again. He said he\u2019d do it and he didn\u2019t again. This went on for months with many different excuses.\n\nAbout two months ago when we all were sick I was doing laundry. I was trying to sort the clothes out and my youngest threw up on me. So I shoved everything that was still clean in the dryer. I put the heat on low then folded everything like normal and he never said anything. Never said anything fit tight or felt like it had shrunk. I felt like I had gotten away with murder and assumed I could just keep doing it.\n\nFast forward to today and he decided to fold the laundry. He noticed his nice Merino Wool base layer in the dryer and said \u201cyou put my merino base layer in the dryer?\u201d And I said \u201cI put everything in the dryer on low now\u201d and he was immediately upset and said it was ruined. I said \u201cI have been putting everything in the dryer for a couple months. I gave you the mesh bags a year and you never used them. So I gave up and started putting everything in the dryer.\u201d Then I said if he \u201cwants his laundry to be done a certain way then he needs to sort it before it goes in the wash or do it himself.\u201d He had only a sarcastic response for me and he made it clear he thinks I\u2019m TA. So Reddit, am I the asshole for putting my husband\u2019s clothes in the dryer?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
