We have two kids under 3 and it\u2019s exhausting. I am primarily a stay at home Mom with some side gigs. He works in recruiting for a big organization. We are 32F and 34M. We share household chores but I primarily do the laundry.\n\nSo onto the problem\u2026 the majority of my husband\u2019s clothing doesn\u2019t go in the dryer, but he has some that does. This has been a sticking point for us for years. I have ADHD and poor working memory so it\u2019s like a horrible game show where someone tells you to sort out objects without there being any pattern or reasoning behind it other than this shirt is older and these jeans are newer etc. It\u2019s confusing and I have tried to figure out which is which but inevitably mistakes happen and things end up in the dryer. When they do he gets upset and is sad because the clothing shrinks and doesn\u2019t fit properly. For further context my husband has a hard time finding clothing that fit him, he\u2019s tall and fit but has a small waist so if it fits in the arms and length it is usually too wide, if it fits in the waist it\u2019s too tight in the arms. He also hates shopping for clothes so when he buys clothing he keeps it for a long time.\n\nAbout a year ago I accidentally put one of my husband\u2019s favourite sweatshirts in the dryer on high heat and it shrunk. He was sad and so I apologized and I came up with the solution of using mesh washing bags for his clothing that doesn\u2019t go in the dryer and went out and bought them for him. I told him to put anything he didnt want dried into the bags and he told me that he would do it.\n\nFast-forward a couple months and he hadn\u2019t bothered to do it and another shirt got dryered . I reminded him of the bags again. He said he\u2019d do it and he didn\u2019t again. This went on for months with many different excuses.\n\nAbout two months ago when we all were sick I was doing laundry. I was trying to sort the clothes out and my youngest threw up on me. So I shoved everything that was still clean in the dryer. I put the heat on low then folded everything like normal and he never said anything. Never said anything fit tight or felt like it had shrunk. I felt like I had gotten away with murder and assumed I could just keep doing it.\n\nFast forward to today and he decided to fold the laundry. He noticed his nice Merino Wool base layer in the dryer and said \u201cyou put my merino base layer in the dryer?\u201d And I said \u201cI put everything in the dryer on low now\u201d and he was immediately upset and said it was ruined. I said \u201cI have been putting everything in the dryer for a couple months. I gave you the mesh bags a year and you never used them. So I gave up and started putting everything in the dryer.\u201d Then I said if he \u201cwants his laundry to be done a certain way then he needs to sort it before it goes in the wash or do it himself.\u201d He had only a sarcastic response for me and he made it clear he thinks I\u2019m TA. So Reddit, am I the asshole for putting my husband\u2019s clothes in the dryer?", "created_utc": 1669484440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5d6kb/aita_for_putting_my_husbands_merino_wool_clothing/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Ignoring the part that you offered him another solution that he doesn\u2019t want to accept)\n\nEdit: you need to tell him \u201cdear husband, I\u2019ve decided I no longer can do you laundry. The stress of accidentally shrinking your shirts is adding to my already huge mental load.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nI would sort all his clothes out of the laundry completely and only wash my own and my kid\u2019s.

You came up with a very easy solution of him separating out what can\u2019t be dried and he refused to use it. Honestly you should just stop doing his laundry if he is going to act like an ungrateful child", "NTA!!! I love my lululemon things and don\u2019t usually splurge. So guess what I do!? I wash them! Jfc!", "NTA. He knows you\u2019re struggling to remember but doesn\u2019t seem to do much about it. He\u2019s an adult, he can either do his own laundry or send it out for dry cleaning.", "NTA. Your husband is acting like a big toddler expecting everyone to bow to his little perfect world. I\u2019d also say that he has no interest in understanding ADHD.\n\nMy situation was different in that my DH just wanted his stuff to be the same color coming out as it was going in. When we married I was 20 and he was 24. I\u2019m an only child. He is the last of 4 boys. My dad and I raised cattle and hogs. I did ALL the chores as Dad also worked full time built was on the road from Sunday night to Friday afternoons. That made me his working farm hand & \u201cson\u201d plus Moms daughter who hated dresses. I\u2019ve always been a hardcore tomboy. When Mom said it was time to do laundry or wash dishes I bailed every time fleeing to the barns to piddle around with the little pigs or work with the adult cows making them my friends. \n\nWhen we married I literally did not know how to use a clothes washer or dryer. I understood how to wash dishes but that was it. Used wayyyy too much dish soap those early years, lol. The laundry tho? All our socks were either blue or pink depending on what got thrown in to wash. I shrunk a sport jacket he was gifted to wear as a pallbearer as I had no knowledge of wool. I was also never diagnosed with ADHD until I turned 50. They thought I had SADD instead so I was a frantic topic changing short-attention-spanned hot mess. He got sick of his closet he\u2019s getting F\u2019d up so he took over washing all of his own closures and taught our 3 kids to do the same so i didn\u2019t unintentionally destroy their clothes too. Now I\u2019m medicated, laid back like a broken beach chair, happier than I\u2019ve ever been and I do all our laundry now. \n\nI know this was long but it shows how my man worked around my weirdo brain and took care of business. It should give you a vision of how your man is not stepping up yo the plate.", "NTA. When I was newly married, my husband didn't like it that I rolled socks and didn't fold them.

If he's not willing to use the bags you got, and if nothing shrank on the low setting, he doesn't have much to complain about. Do let him do his own laundry from now on!", "NTA", "NTA You came up with a great solution with the mesh bags and he\u2019s obviously too lazy to use them. I\u2019m the one in our house who doesn\u2019t want a lot of things in the dryer, so it\u2019s my responsibility to keep up with it.", "NTA. You gave him a solution which he refused to try. I\u2019d simply tell him he\u2019s on his own now for laundry. \n\nI\u2019m very fussy about how mine is done. I live alone so no issues. But if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d still do my own as that way it gets done how I want it", "NTA. You came up with a workable solution that he agreed to.

Maybe I\u2019m petty but I wouldn\u2019t touch his laundry anymore, you shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells while doing something for someone else, let alone in your own house.\n\nMy bf and I live together and usually do laundry separately, but when we do throw our stuff in together, I\u2019m always the one to swap things from washer to dryer so I can fish out my sweaters and more delicate clothes so I can lay them flat to dry. It\u2019s my hang up, so I take care of it. It\u2019s the least labor intensive part of laundry and the least your husband can do if he\u2019s so bent out of shape over this. Or just do his own", "NTA\n\nYou tried to find solutions, he kept reproducing the problems.\n\nLooking for one or two items that don't go in the dryer is a PITA. Let him do his own laundry, so it is always done right.", "NTA. You provided a perfect solution and reminded him of it and he couldn't be bothered.

Jeez.", "I work 55+ hour weeks. My husband is a stay at home parent to 2 kids. Do you know who does my laundry? Me. Because my husband isn't my servant. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou gave him options, he didn't use the bags. So the merino ended up in the dryer. Look, I know a bit about fabrics and most (natural) fabrics shrink in a dryer. It's the way the fibers are.(unless you have a cold option for synthectics). Natural fabrics like cotton and wool need to be dried naturally, on a rack. But, if your husbands merino wool jumpers are *very* expensive, I would bring them to a DryCleaner. \n\nAnother option would be either to buy cheaper clothes, or let him take care of his own (expensive) clothes.\n\nYou're doing the best you can...", "NTA. \n\n\u201cI felt like I had gotten away with murder and assumed..\u201d bordered on being TA, however you had previously come up with a solution that he didn\u2019t feel like putting in the effort to use.

Your husband won\u2019t use the bags, you keep shrinking his clothes. The only solution is for him to dry his laundry. He can wash and dry it, or you can wash it and leave it to him to dry. No more problems.", "never dry anything on high for God sakes!\n\nlemme ask - had you already dried the merino thing on low in the past and it was fine??  but because he SAW it in the dryer this time, he was saying it was ruined?\n\nbecause i made chili once with ground turkey, which \u201cmakes my husband sick\u201d according to him. i didn\u2019t tell him it was turkey and he enjoyed the hell out of it.  sometimes it\u2019s all in their head. \n\nif so, then do his clothes when he\u2019s not around. \n\nif it actually DID shrink on low, forget the damn bag.  my husbands clothes don\u2019t even make it into the hamper, he\u2019s just not gonna use the bag (i mean you could continue to point out that it\u2019s his fault, but that\u2019s unnecessary negative energy  in the house)\n\njust take what Cannot go in the dryer and put a few stitches of red thread on the label.  that way a quick look will keep them outta there. \n\noh and NTA now that you\u2019ve stopped using the High setting", "NTA. \n\nYou offered a reasonable compromise and he refused to go along with it.\n\nAnd to all of those folks saying OP should read the tags? First, a lot of folks cut the tags out. Second, a person caring for two kids under three is lucky to have the time to DO the laundry at all, much less look at every label on a grown man\u2019s clothing when he has refused to take one additional step to make the process simpler.", "NTA. Shit like this happens. If he\u2019s so particular and going to be critical, he should be washing his own clothes.

You are a saint for even thinking you might be TA here. Tell him to do his own laundry if it has special requirements.", "NTA.  A solution was offered and he refused.  I'm so glad I don't give a shit about this kid of thing..in the washer, in the dryer and then in the dresser/closet.", "NTA, accidents happen and you have a lot on your plate right now. Having two small children is exhausting and that's before you add in any housework. \nAs a suggestion: why don't get your husband to take photos of his clothes that can't go into the dryer and stick them on the wall by the washing machine. \n\nAlternatively, tell him to do his own laundry.", "NTA.

My daughters are I are more particular about our clothes (separate colors, some things on delicate cycles) and my husband isn\u2019t.

You came up with a solution so that his clothes wouldn\u2019t get ruined, these are also a bit more expensive so I understand him being upset the first time but since he kept doing it it\u2019s on him. Another solution is for him to do all his own laundry. I\u2019m particular about my clothes so I don\u2019t allow anyone else to do laundry in our house, that\u2019s a chore allocated solely to me.

I\u2019d say from now on he needs to do his own laundry", "NTA. If he's worried about things being shrunk, he can do his own laundry", "NTA My husband does most of the laundry and is particular about how he dries his clothes. When I help with the laundry, it\u2019s towels, sheets or just my stuff.", "NTA for this reason I wash my own clothes (and our sons) and my husband washes his.

You offered a very reasonable solution.  If he can\u2019t be bothered to sort his stuff, why should he expect you to?

He takes responsibility for washing and managing his own clothes and it\u2019s never been a point of contention. Your husband is more than capable of doing his own laundry. You gave him an opportunity to use washing bags and he couldn\u2019t be bothered. Let him do it himself", "NTA OP! I have ADHD also, my husband has stronger preferences for laundry so he just does our laundry, (and I do other chores that he doesn\u2019t like.) maybe a similar setup would make more sense so you aren\u2019t responsible for his laundry!", "NTA, he had ample opportunity to make sure his non-dryer clothes would stay out of the dryer. He didn't want to do that. So either he needs to do his own laundry or deal with the fact that clothes end up in the dryer.", "NTA he needs to separate them or label them or something.  Your bag solution was fine.", "NTA.  My husband has ADHD/memory issues and is also usually responsible for the laundry.  A lot of my clothes shouldn't go in the dryer, so we worked out a system so it's easy for him to get it done without having to remember to check all of the tags every time.  We also have a toddler, so I know that carefully checking tags and sorting things every time isn't always possible anyway.\n\nYou offered your husband a reasonable solution, and he decided he was too lazy to follow it.

Get meds, do CBT. Surely you can read a label. Will ADHD be the excuse for giving your kids the wrong dose of meds? I know a sweater is not a child. But it seems maybe you need better strategies for your ADHD. And I say this as a 44F with ADHD so I know the struggle is real.", "NTA- he has options for making sure his stuff doesn't get thrown in the dryer and he's not taking them.

Maybe a separate laundry bag for him? so HIS and HER laundry bags? \n\nMy husband is particular with his gym clothes and pants too.\n\nI usually do 2 separate loads of laundry, my 3 kids clothes separately, and my husband\u2019s and mine clothes separately. That way it\u2019s easier to sort and the load is smaller. \n\nMy kids ones, I just dump them all in the dryer without sorting. \n\nOur clothes, I check each piece of clothing before I put them in the dryer. Regular clothes in the dryer, gym clothes I air dry.", "ESH\n\nHe needs to use the bags you need to read the clothing labels.\n\nYall are supposed to be a team start acting like one.", "ESH.  Your husband socks for not using the mesh bags, but you suck for not checking the care label.  I imagine anything merino wool will say to hang dry.  No remembering required - when in doubt check the label", "ESH - neither of you seem to want to make much effort to resolve this. Your husband could easily have done the washing himself or at least used the mesh bags, as he agreed to. But for you - ADHD or not, it\u2019s not that hard to just check the labels of things before you dry them if you\u2019ve forgotten whether they dry or not; and if you don\u2019t want to do that, then it\u2019s also easy to just leave your husband\u2019s clothes aside for him to sort out and dry himself when he gets home. Giving up and tumble drying everything instead of just admitting that you made another mistake is passive aggressive nonsense.\n\nBut the real solution here is just to buy clothes that wash the same as all the other clothes. My family had a \u201cnothing that needs ironing\u201d rule while I was growing up, and if we broke it we did our own ironing but otherwise my mum did the laundry. This stuff isn\u2019t hard to work out unless both sides are haggling over a very minimal amount of work.

I've seen a lot of people here talking about making him do his own laundry. Except you stay at home and he works, probably full time. I suffer ADHD too, but I know enough about laundry (m50) to understand that not everything goes in the dryer on high heat, or low, or medium. We had a dryer in our building that would shrink clothes no matter what. Jeans were shrinking, shirts were shrinking, and at first, we thought, meh, we're getting fat. But then stuff that were two sizes too big started getting smaller. Started using the dryer on low, and it stopped. The tags say how stuffs gotta be cleaned. Follow the tags.

We have two kids under 3 and it\u2019s exhausting. I am primarily a stay at home Mom with some side gigs. He works in recruiting for a big organization. We are 32F and 34M. We share household chores but I primarily do the laundry.\n\nSo onto the problem\u2026 the majority of my husband\u2019s clothing doesn\u2019t go in the dryer, but he has some that does. This has been a sticking point for us for years. I have ADHD and poor working memory so it\u2019s like a horrible game show where someone tells you to sort out objects without there being any pattern or reasoning behind it other than this shirt is older and these jeans are newer etc. It\u2019s confusing and I have tried to figure out which is which but inevitably mistakes happen and things end up in the dryer. When they do he gets upset and is sad because the clothing shrinks and doesn\u2019t fit properly. For further context my husband has a hard time finding clothing that fit him, he\u2019s tall and fit but has a small waist so if it fits in the arms and length it is usually too wide, if it fits in the waist it\u2019s too tight in the arms. He also hates shopping for clothes so when he buys clothing he keeps it for a long time.\n\nAbout a year ago I accidentally put one of my husband\u2019s favourite sweatshirts in the dryer on high heat and it shrunk. He was sad and so I apologized and I came up with the solution of using mesh washing bags for his clothing that doesn\u2019t go in the dryer and went out and bought them for him. I told him to put anything he didnt want dried into the bags and he told me that he would do it.\n\nFast-forward a couple months and he hadn\u2019t bothered to do it and another shirt got dryered . I reminded him of the bags again. He said he\u2019d do it and he didn\u2019t again. This went on for months with many different excuses.\n\nAbout two months ago when we all were sick I was doing laundry. I was trying to sort the clothes out and my youngest threw up on me. So I shoved everything that was still clean in the dryer. I put the heat on low then folded everything like normal and he never said anything. Never said anything fit tight or felt like it had shrunk. I felt like I had gotten away with murder and assumed I could just keep doing it.\n\nFast forward to today and he decided to fold the laundry.

Everything was wrinkled beyond belief, but you got it back, lol.\n\nWhen these situations come up with my spouse, I give him options on how whatever can be avoided and let him choose.  If it happens again, I tell him - \u201cwe discussed this, you chose a solution you liked and this happened because YOU didn\u2019t do your part.   From this point forward, if you don\u201dt do what was agreed, the consequences are on YOU.  I am not responsible for what happens, YOU ARE.  Tell me you understand.\u201d\n\nNTA.  Your spouse isn\u2019t a toddler, no matter how much he acts like one.", "NTA. If his clothes need special laundering he could do the laundry himself.", "NTA\n\nIf it all gets washed the same and only drying is the issue AND he refuses to use the bags, split laundry duty - you wash, he dries. If he doesn't accept that further, additional compromise then he wears dirty clothes. Period.", "Let him do the laundry then if all he does is complain and not work with you. NTA.", "NTA I have a laundry basket and when you lift the lid you can see it is divided into two. My husband throws his stuff in one side and I throw my stuff in the other. I wash my more delicate clothes on a shorter, 30c cycle and I don't want his nasty, stinky socks in there. He washes on a much longer, 40c cycle to deal with nasty, nasty socks. He has expensive jumpers he got from Norway, Iceland etc. He deals with them however he wishes. He is a grown man. So is your husband.", "NTA\n\nYou came up w a solution that you both agreed to. He chose not to do what he agreed to do", "NTA", "NTA. My husband does the laundry 75% of the time because he works at home. I do it when I have rare free time between work and school. Most do my clothes require washing in cold water or hang dry. Guess what? I have my own bin for my clothes and handle them in my own time. If I don\u2019t get items to my bin then he\u2019ll grab them and wash. Totally not on him because it\u2019s my real to take care of my own shit if it\u2019s special handling. When he got a couple bleach spots on something I was bummed, but if I\u2019d washed it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. You gave your man an option to separate his special items and he\u2019s too lazy to do it. NTA", "NTA he has been given every opportunity to avoid this,maybe he should do the laundry from now on?", "If you have stipulations about how something is done, do it yourself. Don't make it someone else's problem. NTA", "NTA, I think the better solution is not to wash any of his clothes and throw the dirty ones in his car to take to the laundromat.", "So much work owning a dryer. I wash and hang all clothes. All I need to remember is switch the default wash from warm to cold.\n\nNTA you offered a solution, he failed at the task. You noticed low heat didn't cause noticeable shrinkage and go the job done. He can wash his own garments if he wants to continue to make washing difficult.", "NTA\n\nStop doing his laundry. Sahm or not, he's making this more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nMy dad pulled this crap on my mom early in their marriage. He's now been doing his own laundry for over 40 years. If you stop, eventually he'll figure out how to do it himself", "YTA. If you can't remember how to do the laundry properly, then either hang everything up or let him do his own garments. Ruining Merino wool (expensive) pieces because you want everything in the dryer is inexcusable. \nIf you aren't sure if it can go in the dryer, err on the side of caution and hang it to dry.", "My husband does the laundry and I have some clothes that I'm particular about- I definitely cried over a favorite shirt he accidentally shrunk. But it's my problem, and he doesn't know which clothes need what-- so I set up a separate hamper and he knows whatever goes in that hamper needs to be washed separately and hang dry, and I'll do it myself or he'll do it in-between regular loads.", "This is what I do. There's also a special basket for dry clean only items.", "Agreed, NTA. If he isn't going to follow through with an agreed upon solution, then I would be telling him to do his laundry himself.\n\nHonestly, I would probably be telling him to do it himself regardless \ud83e\udd23", "This.\n\nI do all the laundry in the house just because I'm the one who is particular about what gets washed/dried on what settings.", "Absolutely bizarre that he keeps insisting she do it when she keeps messing it up! I ended up forbidding my ex to do my laundry because she would just throw everything in without checking care labels. If you want something done right do it yourself.", "Could just get a wash & fold service for delicates too", "Why can't OP make a list of things that go/don't go in the dryer to keep next to it?", "The thing is, it\u2019s not really about that. In my house,  my partner does the laundry. When he does, he tells me once \u00ab\u00a0is everything you want cleaned in the laundry basket?\u00a0\u00bb which is already too nice of him. And then he washes everything the way he sees fit. If some things are delicate I deal with them, and that\u2019s it. If something happened to my clothes, he would be sorry, but it wouldn\u2019t not be his fault. His role includes doing laundry at 30 degrees twice a week, and sheets at higher temp once a month. Anything else is on me. And the rule goes backwards for my cooking. I provide 5 to 7 meals a week. He can give insights but ultimately if he doesn\u2019t like it or wants something else that\u2019s on him. Managing expectations and defining clear roles and duties is important for everyone to feel respected.", "People fold socks?!", ">If his clothes still have the tags in them, it\u2019ll have fiver content and washing instruction symbols on them\n\nThat was the first thing I thought. As I was reading it I was like \"yeah, I have executive dysfunction issues due to ADHD too but I can manage to read a tag, and everyone knows wool doesn't go in the dryer\".\n\nUltimately though, I agree with you. That ship has sailed. OP has already given husband multiple opportunities to get their laundry done in the way husband wants it done, and in a way that is manageable for OP. And husband just doesn't care enough to actually implement that system. At this point he's got nobody to blame but himself. OP is NTA in this situation, I don't think.", "This is the best comment", "Omg so then she can meticulously go through the full, dirty hamper and sort out his clothes??? Just add one more thing to her mental load.", "Or he can be an adult. Take pictures of the close so SHE can sort them because he is so incapable? No.", "Sounds like my husband and kale. He only decided he didn\u2019t like it when he saw me using it. He didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been eating it for years. I mean it was green and leafy it wasn\u2019t like I was trying to hide it.", "\n\n>put a few stitches of red thread on the label.\n\nSo... she should do more effort to save his clothes because he can't use the mesh bag??\n\nThough, it does sound like.. he is reacting because he saw it this time, sounds odd?\nBut like... come on that hard to sort your own clothes yourself", "Adhd 43f, I dont read labels. With that many people to laundry for, theres a million things to do and shuffling laundry and reading tags is not one of them. I also dont empty pockets nor turn my husband's clothes right side out (he takes off every single piece of clothing off inside out, I hate it)\nEveryone in my house knows this. Get handed a basket of folded, inside out clothes? Headphones get washed? That's on you. \n\nNow. To be fair, if I hear a clang when dropping something in the washer, or if I feel a weird lump when I grab a pair of pants, I will check then. But otherwise,  no. \nBetween work and the hundred other things I have to do and remember,  spending an extra half hour doing needless extras for laundry is not on my list of priorities. \nAnd to compare laundry labels to a child's medicine is ridiculous. Js", "So do I but there's no reason to lecture or assume she isn't treated.  One of the most research- based and effective strategies for ADHD is limiting the number of things a person needs to mentally track so we can prioritize the things that are most important. Automate and simplify as many menial tasks as possible.  That's exactly what OP is doing-- laundry is a terrible thing to waste mental processing on.", "What's *his* reason for apparently not being able to shove his special items in the mesh bag instead of the general hamper?  Especially if it's some weird, arbitrary system where some specific jeans get dried but not others, based on age.", "Oh wow! You've solved ADHD. All you need is therapy and drugs (which are TOTALLY easy to get) and you never have to deal with the consequences of cognitive dysfunction again! Thanks!", "Wow way to shame someone for making a mistake.  It\u2019s not just that she can\u2019t or won\u2019t or doesn\u2019t read the label. It\u2019s that in order to even do so she has to sort through all of the laundry and figure out which ones go where? And it doesn\u2019t even seem to be a label issue as he is particular about which clothes go where. Laundry is time consuming enough without someone throwing a puzzle in every load.", "She tried having him use a separate laundry bag for clothes which he does not want dried.  He won't do it.", "Lying by omission is a big stretch. She\u2019s supposed to report to him everything that happens in the laundry room GG", "Why does OP have to do husband\u2019s laundry?", "I set up separate hampers and I do my own laundry. It\u2019s a pain to sort a huge pile of laundry when you can put it in a different hamper before that. And I have adhd. It\u2019s the best solution.", "My husband does his dress shirts himself and I do everything else. I\u2019m the one with sweaters that have to lay flat to dry.", "Me too. Bless my husbands heart he tries. He has learned to hang everything up for me. But even then I get upset because he doesn\u2019t hang things up the way I like it or on the right hangers.", "Same here. Many years ago when we were first married, my husband complained about the way I folded his shirts. I said, \"OK, you do your own laundry now.\" And it's been that way ever since. Strangely enough, he got a lot less picky about the way his shirts were folded once he had to do it.", "Thats the way it is in my house too. We all do our own laundry.", "Yep. In my house, by the time you\u2019re 15, you a solely responsible for your own laundry- clothes, sheets,and towels. Didn\u2019t wash and put away? Oh well.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t wool dry clean only?", "I finally started rolling mine - lay them together and roll them up like a haybale. It's great, I can find what I want easily and the sock drawer isn't a mess.", "You're supposed to lay a pair of socks on top of each other and then fold it in half and place them in the drawer that way. Rolling them degrades the nylon elastic that's woven into the cuff which is why after a while the cuffs stretch out of shape.", "Heh, same reaction I had when I saw \"no-iron sheets\" in a catalog. People iron sheets? Really?", "She didn't though. He never noticed a difference, so the low heat wasn't shrinking his clothes.", "CBT specific to ADHD walks through a few different things like assessing your attention span, learning strategies like breaking tasks down into smaller chunks, setting timers within your attention span, creating task lists and prioritizing, learning how to focus again in shorter bursts to avoid making mistakes due to distraction or overwhelm, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s actually pretty helpful. A lot of women are under diagnosed or get diagnosed late in life and have either already figured out some of these strategies on their own or just plain struggle.", "Give me a break.", "Yeah, the mesh bag.\n\nWhat I meant a whole separate laundry bag/basket for himself. \n\nMy husband was also the same, he tried to use the mesh bag once or twice for his favorite gym shirt, then he forgot the mesh bag altogether. So that\u2019s why I usually check each piece of clothing before I transfer to the dryer.", "Yep, in our house, we just separate clothing by person & each does their own. It works out well for us, because I have a lot of delicate/air dry stuff that needs to be washed more frequently while my partner has mostly heavier/darker fabrics anyway.\n\nIf there\u2019s the occasional odd thing that would be better tossed in with someone else\u2019s load, that\u2019s fine.", "I have a few sweaters like that too! They always go in garmet bags though. Otherwise it's so easy to just toss in the dryer.", "Same, except the cutoff age is 13.", "By the time that happens the docks are old and ready to be replaced.", "Drying clothing degrades it over time, even on low heat. It's how you get lots of pilling and loss of printed images.", "While all those strategies ARE helpful, that's not really what cbt is? Cognitive restructuring is designed to change your actual thought patterns, and that's what cbt is primarily based in- for ADHD, it's really helpful in changing your emotional responses to your own difficulties (it is, for instance, much easier to manage executive dysfunction if you're not convinced you're a stupid idiot who can't get anything done right when there's something you need to do), and it can be a useful tool alongside other strategies like the ones you describe, but it is not in itself an entire strategy.\n\nCbt, and the other strategies you outline here, are not helpful tools in this example. They rely heavily on consistency and routine, and OPs husband is not consistent on what needs to be dried in what way. The strategy she does offer is actually perfect and exactly what I and many other people with adult ADHD do: separate a larger task into smaller subtasks with clear divisions- I do all my delicates in different loads so I don't need to divvy them up in the middle of the big task, so the steps from point a to point b don't get interrupted- and if he can't be consistent with the smaller details, then he can at least separate what he needs done into a different task with a different set of steps she can work with. He refused to do so, ergo, the big task gets interrupted in the middle and the strategy fails. ADHD is our own problem to deal with, sure, but if he lives with someone who has it, he will also need to learn how to work with it.", "I use mesh bags and hampers!!", "I started them on laundry duty at 12, but would give reminders and occasionally help out. Oddly enough, each kid did the same thing when they turned 15 (they knew the rules).  Each one kept letting their clothes pile up and I said nothing\u2026. until the panicked teenager came to me yelling they had nothing clean for school. I would calmly reply that I hoped they didn\u2019t sit near anyone they liked because they were going to stink in dirty clothes. Magically, laundry responsibilities were taken very seriously after that.", "No, he pays for his time and she can rely on her unpaid skillset for her half of the time.\n\nY'all act like going to work is some sort of ultimate sacrifice, but the unpaid work that women do to make it possible for you to have a cushy life is barely worth mentioning. The point I'm making here is that most of y'all wouldn't last 3 days in the position.", "If you think childcare is only $1200 a month I feel sorry for you.", "Guess he should have used the net bags or started doing his own laundry then.", "I think OP is NTA, but I'm jumping on your comment to say that air drying clothes really improves their longevity and maintains their quality. It's also free. I don't have a garden, I live in a flat and, if hung right, my clothes never develop a damp smell.", "I'm single. I work FT and do all those things you mention minus the childcare. Laundry, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning is not that damn difficult. \n\nI don't know where this idea came from that being a SAHP is somehow the most difficult job in the universe, but it isn't. Yes it's tedious to do chores and parent young children, but if you slack for a day or things get busy and you can't complete the chores, no one gives a shit. \n\nThis is compared to outside the home jobs which will always carry the stress that if you don't perform well enough, or are late too frequently, or if market conditions change, you can lose your job and suddenly everyone is starving with no roof over their heads.", "The unpaid work is called chores lol the fuck are you talking about ? Being a stay at home parent is a LUXURY lol y\u2019all are privileged. Jesus Christ do you know how insulting gnat is to parents who work ? Most people\nCook and clean and do all that shit and still work champ. No on le pays me to clean my floors, cook my meals etc. it\u2019s called life. Sorry. It being a stay at home parent isn\u2019t the hardest job in the world lol   Wouldn\u2019t last 3 days hahahahah what a joke.", "Ok? I can get it for $10 in Canada. So feel free to go argue with the person who brought up the price then", "You are *deeply* underestimating the amount of work children add to every single aspect of home keeping. We used to do laundry once a week, and with *one* toddler it's now more like 3-4 times a week. Crumbs are everywhere, all the time. Children make so much mess. Watching two children under 3 is a *constant* thing that makes it very hard to do anything else. \n\nCleaning up the mess you yourself made with no distractions is an entirely different game than trying to keep things clean, washed, and feed two small gremlins with absolutely zero sense of self preservation.", "Ah sorry replied to the wrong person. The new set up on mobile breaks me istg", "Yes, and she's got an extra 8-9 hours a day to accomplish it compared to a working outside the home person. Plus outside of those 8-9 hours a day Mon-Friday, she's got a whole other person in the house to help parent the gremlins/contribute to chores. Seems like a pretty fucking cushy life to me."]}
