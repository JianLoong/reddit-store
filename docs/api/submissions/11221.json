We've been friends since school. I have been with my boyfriend for about a year. Bf travels a lot for work and a lot of these trips include socialising with people he's in business with, some of whom are friends. I often travel with him and when he's home he does the same sort of things in our home city. Since Vanessa learned that this is the case, she has been asking to be invited along on nights out and the trips. The thing is, I don't think it would be a good idea for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the people we often travel/go out with are a certain type of guy - work hard, play harder, and they like to \"play\" around certain types of women. Absolutely no issue with these women, a lot of them I've become friends with, and Vanessa is great, too, I love her, but it's oil and water. This wouldn't necessarily be an issue, but my second reason is, Vanessa can get very upset/down/moody when she feels insecure, especially in male dominated environments. If we're at a bar and a guy is talking to me not her, that will pretty much ruin the evening. I don't much mind this when it's me and her, but on a several days long trip, with things like that happening daily, I don't have time to manage her. Third, in the same vein, if I'm out with people my bf is associated with, I feel a responsibility to make sure that I reflect well on him (and vice versa), so bringing Vanessa along just doesn't feel appropriate to me.\n\nIn the beginning I was a bit more honest about not inviting her, saying 'oh, I don't think these people are really your vibe' or 'it's a bit boring just sitting around listening to guys talk', but Vanessa kept insisting she'd like to come, I just started dodging with 'I'll see' or 'I don't know when I'm next doing something', but she keeps becoming more insistent, especially after seeing another friend of mine (not a mutual friend, but Vanessa follows her on social media) post about a trip she came on with me. Vanessa has started complaining to our mutual friends about me being a bad friend for not inviting her and how weird it is that I'm so \"secretive\". I saw her for lunch a few days ago and she wanted to make plans for a certain date and I said I was away. Vanessa then snapped, oh on another one of your shady trip that you refuse to invite me on. I don't know if it was the ros\u00e9 or exhaustion but I said, 'Vanessa, be honest with yourself and with me. Do you think you're going to have a good time surrounded by girls like that and the guys who chase them? Or are you going to get jealous and sulky and have a bad time?' Vanessa told me to f\\*\\*k off and stormed out.\n\nI know it was harsh, but I felt a massive sense of relief that it was all out in the open. However, our mutual friends are pretty split over whether I should have told her or continued dodging it, even if she was talking behind my back. Did I pass honest and go straight to jerk?", "created_utc": 1677685795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f762w/aita_for_telling_my_friend_why_i_dont_invite_her/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like Vanessa is either out for the free drinks and food, or shopping for a boyfriend.  She is not entitled to be involved in every detail of your life, and accusing you of being \"secretive\" indicates the concept of boundaries and personal independence may be challenging for her. People who shit-talk behind their friends' back are not actually friends.  You told her how it was and she didn't like all that shiny bright honesty.  NTA", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is socializing for BUSINESS- it's part of his job.  It's perfectly reasonable to bring a SO to work related events, but bringing a random friend along?  Especially one that you're uncertain of the impression she'll make, and how that could affect your boyfriend's job.\n\nJust look at how she handled being told \"no\" to joining your trip she wasn't invited to- now imagine if one of your boyfriend's colleagues/connections told her no.  How do you estimate that would go?", "Reading between the lines, it sounds like your BF is in some kind of sales which attracts a lot of the smarmy \u201clets party on the company dime\u201d guys who also like \u201carm candy\u201d instead of actual women.  Socializing is not just part of the job, it is the job.  We can all argue all we want that it shouldn\u2019t be this way but clearly it is.  On top of that, your friend is not only not an \u2018arm candy\u2018 kinda girl but she gets pouty and jealous if men pay attention to others.  I would NEVER bring her.", "NTA - You simply word this as a WORK trip... not a fun one.", "NTA\n\nThis friend of yours is absolutely an AH about this. She kept harassing you, you told her partial truth about why you don't want her.\n\nThen she kept pressuring you again, and started bad-mouthing you. She deserved your blunt truth for why you never invite her.\n\nI never considered someone an AH for giving a blunt reply to a question. Someone else asks. Especially when the someone else has made every attempt to dodge and ignore polite replies.", "NTA. Your friends' option was to keep dodging, which is only making her more insistant, so not an option. At some point, you need to confront the problem.", "NTA... Why would you invite your friend on your BF's work trip? And why does she feel she has the right to ask in the first place? Just say that all your socialization is with people he works with. That should be the end of it.

If you don't feel comfortable including her with some of her other friends, she needs to know why.    \n\n>However, our mutual friends are pretty split over whether I should have told her or continued dodging it,\n\nHow many of your mutual friends think that you should invite her though?   It sounds as though most of them realize that she's not a good fit for these types of trips.  Do not back down and invite her just to placate her.", "You answered cause she asked NTA", "NTA.   Who invites themselves to horn in on a friends' SO's  business trip?\n\nYou're correct that you should not do anything that might reflect poorly, given the business nature.", "NTA. Sounds like I used to work with similar clientele to your bf\u2019s and it\u2019s an interesting crowd, not for everyone, but can be a fun crowd. I think it\u2019s weird how insistent Vanessa has been about inviting herself to these events and she seems to have no self-awareness of how awkward she makes things for you at these events. And I agree with you that since these are your bf\u2019s clients, it\u2019s important to reflect positively so there\u2019s no chance of behavior affecting his relationship with those clients.\n\nYeah, I do think you were a bit harsh but my god, she was not picking up on all of your reasons for not letting her constantly invite herself to these events and even going so far as to get upset that someone else had gone. Her complaining to mutual friends seems to solidify that she\u2019s not mad about not getting to hang out with you, but she\u2019s mad she\u2019s not invited to these events she really has no business going to in the first place. So it actually sounds like she\u2019s using you.\n\nSince you felt relief after what you said, maybe it\u2019s time to end this relationship with Vanessa. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re friends because you want to be, it sounds like you just stayed friends out of habit/history, even though you\u2019ve grown apart.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve taken a hint if she didn\u2019t want to be hit with a truthbomb.", "NTA but handle with care. You are not obliged to invite Vanessa to anything just because you are friends.

If she talks to you again, and I hope she does, maybe you can just level with her, like, \"here's what I see you do when it's just us out together, and that behavior makes me think you wouldn't enjoy these trips, and I have to consider how that might reflect on my bf's career, tell me if I'm wrong.\" And then you can have the conversation you need to have, but if she's going to act like a child about it, I totally get why you snapped at her.", "NTA. You've apparently tried many times to do this diplomatically and she refuses to drop it, so there comes a time when they just gotta take both barrels.", "NTA it\u2019s one things if you purposely left her out of your friend group trip but from the sound of it, most of these happen because of your bf trip and they\u2019re mostly your boyfriend side of friends.

She badgered you over and over and got what she deserved.", "There's so much to read between the lines in this post that it's hard to judge.

Also, this all seems a little inappropriate for a work-related event?\n\nESH (but I'm willing to change my judgment if new info is shared)\n\nYour vagueness and \"secrecy\" would undoubtedly be annoying. Friend wants to hang out with the group! There's nothing wrong with that, and I can imagine you continually brushing her off instead of reasonably explaining the issue like an adult caused more problems. Or you should've invited her once to prove to her that it wasn't her crowd and y'all could move on.\n\nVanessa sucks for being annoying and snapping at you. She's not entitled to an invite to these events, but IMO it's not exactly good friendship behavior that you aren't willing to invite her but weren't being up front about it.", "NTA but I don't get why you didn't bring her to a single event in your own city where she can see why she wouldn't enjoy it.

This might be overthinking somethis as simple as getting drunks, but you could have easily set up a \"trial run\" with a smaller group of them at happy hour to see if she could be normal. If she really can't help but be a brat you will know better, but maybe this could instead be an opportunity to mature socially... or even get laid. Even if she does act like you worry about, I doubt your husband's friends will care.\n\n\nOverall, it sounds like you are taking yourself way to seriously, and the gate keeping vibes over getting some cocktails is weird.

I also have a doctorate and can leave them in the dust when we talk code or economics, which makes them wary. It's kind of fun watching sales bros try to figure it out. I mostly turn up if a client expects me there, have a really nice cocktail on the company dime, and then continue on to my real plans or going home to enjoy my couch and a book.  I have met some great male colleagues who are comfortable in this environment but still understand that I'm, you know, a person, and not a piece of meat.) \n\nOverall though, I would not subject any of my female friends to these types of gatherings because I wouldn't put them in situations where they're viewed more as a commodity than as a complete person with thoughts, feelings, and skills.

So, by OP's account, the friend isn't \"highly attractive\", so she would neverfit in with this crowd. And on top of that, Friend is insecure and become moody when men give attention to other women. This is probably what would have happen in those \"event\", and OP doesn't want to deal with that when it's her boyfriend event. \n\nHonestly, I also find those party sketchy but I can understand OP doesn't want to deal with the insecurity of her friend. I wouldn't either. But those problems should have been adress earlier, and in a more polite way."]}
