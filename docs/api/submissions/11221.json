We've been friends since school. I have been with my boyfriend for about a year. Bf travels a lot for work and a lot of these trips include socialising with people he's in business with, some of whom are friends. I often travel with him and when he's home he does the same sort of things in our home city. Since Vanessa learned that this is the case, she has been asking to be invited along on nights out and the trips. The thing is, I don't think it would be a good idea for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the people we often travel/go out with are a certain type of guy - work hard, play harder, and they like to \"play\" around certain types of women. Absolutely no issue with these women, a lot of them I've become friends with, and Vanessa is great, too, I love her, but it's oil and water. This wouldn't necessarily be an issue, but my second reason is, Vanessa can get very upset/down/moody when she feels insecure, especially in male dominated environments. If we're at a bar and a guy is talking to me not her, that will pretty much ruin the evening. I don't much mind this when it's me and her, but on a several days long trip, with things like that happening daily, I don't have time to manage her. Third, in the same vein, if I'm out with people my bf is associated with, I feel a responsibility to make sure that I reflect well on him (and vice versa), so bringing Vanessa along just doesn't feel appropriate to me.\n\nIn the beginning I was a bit more honest about not inviting her, saying 'oh, I don't think these people are really your vibe' or 'it's a bit boring just sitting around listening to guys talk', but Vanessa kept insisting she'd like to come, I just started dodging with 'I'll see' or 'I don't know when I'm next doing something', but she keeps becoming more insistent, especially after seeing another friend of mine (not a mutual friend, but Vanessa follows her on social media) post about a trip she came on with me. Vanessa has started complaining to our mutual friends about me being a bad friend for not inviting her and how weird it is that I'm so \"secretive\". I saw her for lunch a few days ago and she wanted to make plans for a certain date and I said I was away. Vanessa then snapped, oh on another one of your shady trip that you refuse to invite me on. I don't know if it was the ros\u00e9 or exhaustion but I said, 'Vanessa, be honest with yourself and with me. Do you think you're going to have a good time surrounded by girls like that and the guys who chase them? Or are you going to get jealous and sulky and have a bad time?' Vanessa told me to f\\*\\*k off and stormed out.\n\nI know it was harsh, but I felt a massive sense of relief that it was all out in the open. However, our mutual friends are pretty split over whether I should have told her or continued dodging it, even if she was talking behind my back.

It sounds like Vanessa is either out for the free drinks and food, or shopping for a boyfriend.  She is not entitled to be involved in every detail of your life, and accusing you of being \"secretive\" indicates the concept of boundaries and personal independence may be challenging for her.

Especially one that you're uncertain of the impression she'll make, and how that could affect your boyfriend's job.\n\nJust look at how she handled being told \"no\" to joining your trip she wasn't invited to- now imagine if one of your boyfriend's colleagues/connections told her no.  How do you estimate that would go?", "Reading between the lines, it sounds like your BF is in some kind of sales which attracts a lot of the smarmy \u201clets party on the company dime\u201d guys who also like \u201carm candy\u201d instead of actual women.  Socializing is not just part of the job, it is the job.  We can all argue all we want that it shouldn\u2019t be this way but clearly it is.  On top of that, your friend is not only not an \u2018arm candy\u2018 kinda girl but she gets pouty and jealous if men pay attention to others.  I would NEVER bring her.", "NTA - You simply word this as a WORK trip... not a fun one.", "NTA\n\nThis friend of yours is absolutely an AH about this. She kept harassing you, you told her partial truth about why you don't want her.\n\nThen she kept pressuring you again, and started bad-mouthing you.

Why would you invite your friend on your BF's work trip? And why does she feel she has the right to ask in the first place? Just say that all your socialization is with people he works with. That should be the end of it.

Sounds like I used to work with similar clientele to your bf\u2019s and it\u2019s an interesting crowd, not for everyone, but can be a fun crowd. I think it\u2019s weird how insistent Vanessa has been about inviting herself to these events and she seems to have no self-awareness of how awkward she makes things for you at these events. And I agree with you that since these are your bf\u2019s clients, it\u2019s important to reflect positively so there\u2019s no chance of behavior affecting his relationship with those clients.\n\nYeah, I do think you were a bit harsh but my god, she was not picking up on all of your reasons for not letting her constantly invite herself to these events and even going so far as to get upset that someone else had gone. Her complaining to mutual friends seems to solidify that she\u2019s not mad about not getting to hang out with you, but she\u2019s mad she\u2019s not invited to these events she really has no business going to in the first place. So it actually sounds like she\u2019s using you.\n\nSince you felt relief after what you said, maybe it\u2019s time to end this relationship with Vanessa.

If she talks to you again, and I hope she does, maybe you can just level with her, like, \"here's what I see you do when it's just us out together, and that behavior makes me think you wouldn't enjoy these trips, and I have to consider how that might reflect on my bf's career, tell me if I'm wrong.\" And then you can have the conversation you need to have, but if she's going to act like a child about it, I totally get why you snapped at her.", "NTA.

There's nothing wrong with that, and I can imagine you continually brushing her off instead of reasonably explaining the issue like an adult caused more problems. Or you should've invited her once to prove to her that it wasn't her crowd and y'all could move on.\n\nVanessa sucks for being annoying and snapping at you.

If we're at a bar and a guy is talking to me not her, that will pretty much ruin the evening. \n\nWhy would you even be friends with someone like this, who clearly sees her as superior to you and therefore gets sad/angry when you're given attention instead of her?", "NTA - you shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cmanage\u201d your almost 30yr old adult friend. She should be able to handle her emotions and not depend on random mens validation.", "NTA 1) this is a level of business not just pleasure. 2) you tried to give her every chance and she just kept pushing .

Brutal but she needed it and proved yoir point when storming off", "Sounds like managing a child", "NTA. Just tell her NO. ITs a work event.

Stick to your guns.", "To be honest, I'm reading it as if OP IS bringing other friends on these trips, which means that it's specifically Vanessa that she doesn't want to bring along.\n\nOP is still in the right, and Vanessa is being needlessly pushy.

She proved your point.", "YTA for making it seem as if you live a charmed existence that your friend isn't good enough for.

That's my type, not necessarily \"rich\" but good-looking and loves to travel, definitely, is my type.", "Totally understand where you're coming from, I worked in banking for a while and it was a trip.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's different when you're a woman not there in a work capacity, no one is really expecting anything of you than to party and keep smiling. I've had a lot of fun with these guys in small doses, and the girls that come usually do. If you're looking to drink and travel for free it's a decent deal lol.

You say that you don't mind being out if it's just the two of you, but didn't go much beyond that. Do you do things with her and other friends, or do you keep it to just 1-on-1?\n\nI think my answer hinges on this: If Vanessa has been included with you and your bf at other events, gatherings, etc. outside of his business, then you are NTA. You don't have to take every friend to every event. You certainly don't have to invite them on trips.\n\nBut if you've excluded her entirely from being around your bf, then my opinion shifts to ESH. There has to be a way for you to make her feel included, or, if you don't want to do that, you owe it to her to make the boundary abundantly clear, or just end the friendship.\n\nIn either case, I don't think Vanessa is taking a hint, and she gets the AH from me.", "NTA\n\nVanessa should not be going along to your husband's work events. It's not appropriate for her to be there. She shouldn't have asked to be included, and you should just say no with no further discussion.", "NTA. You just go to keep him company, and this is appropriate since you're his girlfriend. \n\nThis girl seems to think that these trips are a vacation when these trips are essential for your boyfriend's job.", "Take this as a win.

I bet the relief is from her entire existence being lifted off you.", "You know, sometimes people just really need to hear the harsh truth before they start thinking about their behavior. Many years ago my friend had to have a talk with me and it really did open my eyes.", "Why does this girl want to tag along on your bf business trips!?! It seems super desperate to press you guys about this, as if it's not super weird, when she clearly just wants introductions to men.

Free food,free drinks?\n\nNaah so not the asshole", "Just teller the truth, you spend time with coked out womanizing douchebags and you don't think she'd get a long with them.", "That's assuming a whole lot", "It's probably because OP would be bringing female friends who would suit the vibe more, eg hot friends. OP'S friend may feel excluded/unattractive as a result.\n\nRegardless of that, the friend is pushing the limits of friendship and OP is not responsible in managing her emotions", "So question you guys been friends am assuming for a few years.

Did you ever have a conversation with her about any of this? \n\nI also understand where she\u2019s coming from when the events are happening in the same city and being the only friend not being invited.

I wouldn't invite her out with anyone who you or your bf need to have a good repore with!", "NTA she sounds exhausting", "NTA why invite a friend on a trip you know they won't enjoy?", "NTA - but you should have been honest from the start. Simply explain that you and bf chose to keep work and social friends separate. No co-mingling in the friends circle (no vin-diagram). I certainly do not co-mingle my work and personal friendships.

But sometimes that\u2019s nice. Nobody was pretending to be in love, or have deep meaningful relationships, we were just two consenting adults who wanted to hang out, flirt and part ways with nothing serious happening.\n\nBut, it is 100% shallow and superficial", "Look, I didn't mean that comment to imply any man outside of actually shallow men are being shallow. All I meant was that women shouldn't be treated like the only value they have is their appearance when a man treats them like that's their only value.", "Being a decorative human is a weird experience, but honestly it can be a kinda pleasant reprieve in a way when your actual regular life involves proving your intellect.\n\nI've aged out of the running for that mess, but when I was younger? Being arm candy was a rare and weirdly relaxing thing.", "Sure, but as you say that would be shallow for *both* parties involved, and the comment I responded to said it\u2019s just the men with shallow reasons.", "NTA \n\nShe kept pushing.

She would have meltdowns sometimes when I did nice things for my partner, and my gf spent a lot of time consoling her.\n\nI felt sooo bad, like, I know what loneliness is.\n\nBut then she was hanging out one night and tried to hookup/get me to cheat, and all the compassion went through the window.", "Alright boys, throw 'emotionally open' out the window!", "It sounds really weird to be.. like low key pimping.  After years of hosting sales teams and hi end sakes/marketing events, I'm unfamiliar with trips where the employee's girlfriend brings friend(s) to hang out. Sales ppl may bring a friend, partner, family, or a few guy friends for a boys weekend, but never the employee's gf bringing friends. It sounds very strange.", "That's because it pretty much is. This has nearly always been present in certain circles. Some companies specifically hire attractive women as a way to entice clients, or have these women 'host' events.", "We really haven't been given enough info about the instance where she DID bring a friend, to make those kinds of assumptions. It could have just been that OP decided to tag along with a friend and do their own thing for a few days in a new city.", "What I don't like from OP post is that she sounds kind of judgy \"this type of woman\", \"that type of woman\".

I mean OP clearly sees herself as different.\n\nFor me many of the reasons for OP not wanting Vanessa there make her an ah. All the nonsense about \"type of woman\" specifically.\n\nBut, and a big one, this is OPs boyfriend job, not some playground. For me that was the only reason needed for OP to reject Vanessa, this is OPs boyfriend Job and it is not appropriate to bring outsiders. Add to that the fact that Vanessa because pouty if she is not the center of attention and you get a mess. But the problem is Vanessa, not the \"type of women\" on those places. She shouldn't be asking so much to be invited to a work thing from a friends boyfriend, and she should accept when people says no. And OP shouldn't have beaten so much around the bush. This is work, not a game, not everyone can join, no more reasons needed.\n\nNTA. But the wording makes me want to write e s h.", "I was mistaken for arm candy more than once when I was young. I never thought it was a reprieve from anything. It was demeaning and often frightening; I ran into a lot of men who didn't know that \"no\" was a complete sentence."]}
