{"id": 8188, "submission_id": "10kgkf0", "title": "AITA for saying my boyfriend was relived he isn't invited to my friend's wedding?", "selftext": "I (31F) was recently invited to my friend Jess' wedding, and my partner of 7 years wasn't.  This friend of mine has a lot of friends (so lots of people to host) and her and her fiance have only met my partner (Rick) once or twice and barely have a relationship. I am not offended in the slightest that he is not invited, and Rick hates weddings, especially when he is a plus one, so it worked out well for us. Most of my friends have fiances/husbands who have been invited despite being together the same amount of time, but again they are engaged/married, so on the right side of a certain \"cut off\" plus I believe they all know the couple better anyway.\n\nSeveral of us were together for a meal recently (Rick could not make it) and the wedding was brought up. One of my single friends mentioned that we were sharing a hotel room, and Jess took that opportunity to apologise that they didn't invite Rick. This was in front of everyone and it was a little awkward as the partners of everyone else there had been invited. I said \"no problem, not an issue at all\" and tried to change the subject. She then continued and said that they just had to be really strict as they had so many people to invite, and again that she hopes we don't take it too personally. I was getting even more embarrassed at this point because everyone was looking at me for my reaction (I believe my other friends have gossiped about the lack of invite for Rick, thinking it should be an issue, despite it being a non issue for us).\n\nAs I just wanted to move on and make it less awkward, I then said with 100% good intentions, \"oh you know what Rick's like, he's probably relieved, he hates weddings and dancing! Literally not a problem at all Jess don't worry about it\".\n\nJess then went quiet for the rest of the night and looked pissed off. Her fiance has now got it touch with me to say what I said was out of order, you can't tell people that someone was relived for not being invited to their wedding. Not only was I obviously joking with the comment to lighten the awkward mood, I also don't think you can not invite someone to something, and then expect them to act like they wish they were invited? As if they're sat at home wishing they were there?\n\nAm I an asshole for not knowing that comment would cause offence? Should I apologise?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: wow! Thank you all for your responses in support. I would like to say that I genuinely believe  they really needed criteria to cut down on the guest list, especially when they don't know someone too well, and they weren't trying to make a comment about marriages being more legitimate. I also think she did feel bad and was trying to over explain, rather than rub it in. I don't think she should have got offended, but I also don't think she's as bad as a lot of you seem to think!

Considering they kept bringing it up, your half joke was great and a way to break the awkwardness.\n\nMaybe she's upset someone doesn't care about going to her wedding? idk.", "Well, I've been on reddit long enough to know your friend did not invite rick to the wedding to make a point and to start some drama. Probably about you guys still not getting engaged or married. And her wedding was SOOO exclusive that only married couples could go. Just so she can lord it over you that she did \"manage to get a ring\" ( it's an achievement for some). \n\nAnd now here you come. Not getting the hint and not getting upset. \ud83d\ude12  you're even happy that rick not  being invited worked out soo well for the both of you.\n\nNtA.  But you not getting upset did deprive your friend of considering her wedding as THE event of the year.\n\nPs: get bew friends. Even the ones not saying anything knew what was coming next. These are not nice people.", "Hell no, and frankly - even if Rick didn't want to go, it is really fucking weird that she didn't invite him if you have been together for 7 years. NTA", "NTA.  Good grief!  You were put on the spot, twice, and spoke only of your boyfriend's preferences.\n\nThis couple needs to get over it.", "NTA - she was trying to get a rise out of you for some reason, and you wouldn't take the bait.   Now she is annoyed that her wedding isn't so important that it can create some drama - this side quest fizzled out before it started.  LOL", "Jess is hurt that her actions didn\u2019t cause you and Rick to be disappointed that Rick wasn\u2019t invited to her wedding.  And she embarrassed herself because she was trying to shame you in front of a group of people who were invited and it backfired on her.  \n\nShe has the makings of a spoiled and entitled Bridzilla.  \n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA. What kind of reverse mind games is this? Did she want you to be offended and not come? I\u2019m so confused by her intentions. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I would have taken your remark as a way to make me feel better for not inviting Rick. Not sure what their problem is.", "Nta.... wtf its like they wanted you to be upset and cause a scene thats weird", "NTA. She really wanted to double down and put it in someone\u2019s face that they aren\u2019t married. (*ahem* She was trying to put you down because you\u2019re not legally married and therefore less than other couples.) \n\nThen she got all offended because her party clearly isn\u2019t THE party to attend. She\u2019s a gigantic AH and I don\u2019t know why you would continue to be friends with someone who literally dismisses your partner of 7 yrs. That idiotic piece of paper (or promise of signing one) doesn\u2019t make your relationship magical. Please. \n\nPeople need to get over that BS. Besides, women lose out sooooo much when they legally get married (unless you want to be a SAHP, then marry away for the legal protections.)", "NTA she was looking for a response and didn't get the one that she wanted. Cake is on her face because of it, good for you.", "NTA! I think you handled it well and gave a perfect response. I have now idea why anybody would be upset!", "NTA. Your friends sound completely exhausting. Think about what they are doing. They're setting up the entire situation for you to be upset about it, and then they can reaffirm to you how unimportant your BF is to them. They sound like terrible people TBH.", "NTA but her reaction tells you something. She meant it to be a slight. She purposefully didn't invite him to get a petty reaction out of either you or him, and when you didn't react the way she wanted she got pissed.", "NTA.\n\nTheir thinking must be: \"How dare they not be offended that we excluded them! Who do they think they are accepting that we don't want them at our wedding!\"", "NTA...I  would have a nifty two word answer for them, but that likely wouldn't go over well either. Were they actually hoping that you'd be offended? Surely they have bigger things in life to worry about.", "NTA. \n\nYou tried to change the subject. She kept bringing it up. What were you supposed to do? Make a scene and demand him to be invited?", "NTA\nKinda weird that you've been together for 7 years and they dont invite him bc they dont know him well.", "NTA. You were just being honest but as everyone knows some people can\u2019t handle the truth. I can kind of see why Jess took your comment the wrong way because if she really did feel guilty about not inviting Rick , she probably feels foolish for feeling bad now that she knows that he didn\u2019t want to go anyway. That was something that Jess and her fianc\u00e9 should talk about among themselves though. They shouldn\u2019t have confronted you about it because you didn\u2019t say anything offensive", "NTA. I have no idea what your friend wanted from you in that situation. Were you supposed to burst out crying because it's just SO UNFAIR that other people's SO were invited and yours wasn't? Because her wedding is obviously the most important and special thing in your life, apparently. It was an honest answer and it sucks that it wasn't what she wanted to hear, but I honestly can't think of what you could have said in that situation, especially since she didn't take the hint after the first attempt at a subject change.", "NTA, but I'm kind of wondering if the non invite for Rick was in the hopes you would decline as well?  The fact she kept on the subject after you said it wasn't a big deal is curious.  Then the fiance calling you to fuss over you saying Rick's probably relieved...", "NTA and they are being ridiculous. Tell them you didn't want to shame them in front of everyone over the incredibly poor etiquette of excluding your long-time partner, so you tried to save them from the embarrassment by making a light-hearted joke. Then say you and Rick would like an apology for the exclusion, and you would like an apology for their lack of grace and saying you are \"out of order.\" Not that you need or deserve them, of course, but to pre-empt their insistence that you own them an apology.", "NTA. Geez, I would personally just not go at that point. They are super rude! Sorry that in order to have saved the mood you would have had to pretend to be offended when you weren't to save their feelers \\*Eye-rolls\\*.", "Nta but they are trying to make some kinda point not inviting him. They are both to upset you and rick are not bothered. This was an intentional slight and all your \u201cfriends\u201d know it and are involved. Why do they hate rick or your relationship", "NTA Your friend decided to make a show of not inviting your partner to her wedding in front of your friends. You assured her it was fine. She chose not to let it go, not you. It's quite humourous your friends were offended your boyfriend was glad he didn't receive an invitation. Did they think he'd pout and demand you ask for a plus one?", "NTA. They don't sound like very good friends either.", "NTA  \n\n\nsounds like she was fishing for drama to be honest", "NTA. They repeatedly put you on the spot and obviously wanted to cause some drama with their action. Now they are angry because their plot to shame you was retorted against themselves.", "fake friends strike again \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0fjust pass on the wedding and let her feel your absence", "NTA had you said it unprompted, I would say it\u2019s rude. But you were basically shoved into a conversational corner. How else were you supposed to get her to stop making a thing of it?", "You're NTA. Jess is overreacting to a harmless comment.", "NTA. And that's pretty weird on their part.", "NTA, but Jess sure is for:\n\n1. Putting you on the spot in public about a topic/issue that a lot of people *would* feel some type of way about instead of, you know, reaching out to you privately and extending the same explanation in the first place. \n\n2. Not respecting your initial response, which was both diplomatic and true, and instead continuing to push the issue until she got the response she thought she wanted. \n\n3. Getting upset about the (benign) response she ultimately received because she couldn\u2019t drop it before she got her feelings hurt and siccing her fianc\u00e9 on you to scold you. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s not as bad as she sounds but she doesn\u2019t sound great, regardless. Frankly, she sounds like one of those people who *hates* drama *so much* but is also always causing/involved in/gossiping about drama, lol. My impression based on your post is that she\u2019s less offended by what you actually said and more mad that you didn\u2019t get upset because now she has to come up with a new narrative so she can complain to others in your social sphere. If you notice friends who weren\u2019t there suddenly acting strange around you, I\u2019d bet that it\u2019s because she twisted your words to \u201cOP said she and her bf don\u2019t even care about my wedding!\u201d I also believe that, no matter what you\u2019d said, you would\u2019ve gotten a call from the fianc\u00e9 telling you that you were in the wrong.", "NAT, but you are externally dense. \n\nHer actions show she was intentionally sending a message to your partner that he was unwanted/excluded/not valued, and your comment meant she was denied her power to exclude. \n\nThis is the same as the kid in grade school who makes a big deal of pointing out that you were not invited to their birthday.

Make me think she wanted to make you feel 'less' than the other guests. Specially when she talked and insisted about it in front of your mutual friends. Are you sure she is your friend?", "I don't see how OP sucks", "Oh for SURE - she wanted it to be drama. She was probably one more glass of cheap chardonnay away from telling OP the REAL reason why he wasn't invited until OP took the wind right out of it by saying he didn't want to go anyway.
