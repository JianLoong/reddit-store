My motto is hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. \n\nBest case scenario? He's just a lonely guy looking for conversation. That's fine! But you still have boundaries and he needs to respect them if he wants you to be his friend. Even if this is the case, you have a job. He couldn't walk into an office building every day to chat with you, he shouldn't do that at your current place of business, which is your home. \n\nWorst case scenario, he IS a creep who, at the very least, is letting his dogs use your yard as a bathroom, possibly looking in your windows, and maybe planning something worse. \n\nAnything you can do to increase privacy is smart. Blinds, curtains, shutters, or privacy film are good options. I've also seen people [paint windows with glue](https://totallythebomb.com/people-painting-elmers-glue-on-windows). As others have mentioned, cameras and motion detection lights are probably also a good idea. I'd throw in a few no trespassing signs for good measure.

Bring dinner and say you made too much, or bake cookies or some shit for him. Old people love cookies. You could explain that you don't want to hurt his feelings, but between the hours of x:00-x:00 you're working and can't socialize. Or tell him about other creepy men you have encountered so he understands why you're uncomfortable with certain behaviors. \n\nLet me be clear, you don't owe him any explanation. Or any friendship. So that part is entirely up to you and your comfort level! But do take steps to ensure your safety unless & until your boundaries are respected.", "NTA.

The bolt of the lock is held in place by a small plate that is attached by short screws. \n\nFYI, I am not affiliated with this company, just a fan.  \n\nThe kit includes heavy duty steel plates that go over the hinge plates, the lock bolt receiver and one that wraps around the door where the bolt comes out of the door.
