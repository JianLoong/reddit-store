My niece is now 8. She was a baby when my sister met her husband. Her husband was a widower going on 3 years with a son who was 9 or 10 and a daughter who was 8. They were married after 9 months of dating. My sister has three boys with her husband as well. The boys are now 6, 5 and 2. My sister has talked about how meeting her husband was the best thing to happen to her and my niece because it meant my niece got to grow up with two parents and have a second parent who loves her. This is true. My niece's bio dad is a POS and would never have been there and never would have paid for my niece. My sister's husband adopted my niece.\n\nLast Saturday my sister's family were at my house and my niece and my 6 and 5 year old nephew's were upset. I asked them what was up and my niece said that her older siblings were mad at them and didn't think they were the best thing to happen to them. I asked what she meant and she explained that they were complaining about the family and she told them they were the best thing to happen to them, just like they were for her and her mom, because they could be a whole family and nobody was missing. She said they snapped and told her they would rather have their mom back than have them. My nephew's were there when the older kids said it. My sister told the three kids their older siblings didn't mean it and were just being grumpy. My niece said she \"told off\" the older kids for being grumpy and saying things they didn't mean. They told her yet again that she and her mom were not the best thing to happen to them, that they only had them because they lost their mom and would rather have her back. My niece and nephews were upset. Niece was saying they should think of them as the best thing to happen to them because their family is great.\n\nI told my niece that her stepsiblings were not wrong. That they had to lose a mom they loved and that will always hurt and that the best for them would be to have their mom still. She asked why. I said because you can't replace that hurt. I said a stepfamily can still be good. But the best is always to not lose people in the first place. I told her it was like mine and her mom's dad. How he died and how yes, we had a nice stepfamily after, but the best for me would have always been to have my dad around. My niece said did I not like her grandpa and I said it wasn't about that. But her grandpa was not my dad. They sort of got it, kinda. My sister overheard the whole conversation and pulled me aside and told me I never should have said those things to her kids and imagine how hurt they are to know their older siblings hate them and won't give them a chance. She also told me I shouldn't bring \"our dad\" (she means my stepdad but she always called and saw him as our dad because she was younger than me when dad died and mom remarried). She said her stepkids are not right and I made her kids think differently.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680964967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fo54i/aita_for_telling_my_niece_and_nephews_their_older/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't wrong, but it's not your place to be butting in. You aren't their parent. You have no idea if this was part of a bigger private conversation or whether your sister wanted to talk to her husband about it before talking to the kids about it further.

Your niece's father it sounds like is a deadbeat that she never knew, the boys had a mother they loved die. It wasn't the same situation.
