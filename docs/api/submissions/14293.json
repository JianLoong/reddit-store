My niece is now 8. She was a baby when my sister met her husband. Her husband was a widower going on 3 years with a son who was 9 or 10 and a daughter who was 8. They were married after 9 months of dating. My sister has three boys with her husband as well. The boys are now 6, 5 and 2. My sister has talked about how meeting her husband was the best thing to happen to her and my niece because it meant my niece got to grow up with two parents and have a second parent who loves her. This is true. My niece's bio dad is a POS and would never have been there and never would have paid for my niece. My sister's husband adopted my niece.\n\nLast Saturday my sister's family were at my house and my niece and my 6 and 5 year old nephew's were upset. I asked them what was up and my niece said that her older siblings were mad at them and didn't think they were the best thing to happen to them. I asked what she meant and she explained that they were complaining about the family and she told them they were the best thing to happen to them, just like they were for her and her mom, because they could be a whole family and nobody was missing. She said they snapped and told her they would rather have their mom back than have them. My nephew's were there when the older kids said it. My sister told the three kids their older siblings didn't mean it and were just being grumpy. My niece said she \"told off\" the older kids for being grumpy and saying things they didn't mean. They told her yet again that she and her mom were not the best thing to happen to them, that they only had them because they lost their mom and would rather have her back. My niece and nephews were upset. Niece was saying they should think of them as the best thing to happen to them because their family is great.\n\nI told my niece that her stepsiblings were not wrong. That they had to lose a mom they loved and that will always hurt and that the best for them would be to have their mom still. She asked why. I said because you can't replace that hurt. I said a stepfamily can still be good. But the best is always to not lose people in the first place. I told her it was like mine and her mom's dad. How he died and how yes, we had a nice stepfamily after, but the best for me would have always been to have my dad around. My niece said did I not like her grandpa and I said it wasn't about that. But her grandpa was not my dad. They sort of got it, kinda. My sister overheard the whole conversation and pulled me aside and told me I never should have said those things to her kids and imagine how hurt they are to know their older siblings hate them and won't give them a chance. She also told me I shouldn't bring \"our dad\" (she means my stepdad but she always called and saw him as our dad because she was younger than me when dad died and mom remarried). She said her stepkids are not right and I made her kids think differently.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680964967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fo54i/aita_for_telling_my_niece_and_nephews_their_older/", "score": 578, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I was the parent I would be pissed if my sister was having this serious of a conversation without discussing it with me.", "YTA for parenting your sister's kids. You weren't wrong, but it's not your place to be butting in. You aren't their parent. You have no idea if this was part of a bigger private conversation or whether your sister wanted to talk to her husband about it before talking to the kids about it further. This is a sensitive issue that they are going to have to deal with as a family and having extended family get into the middle of it just creates drama. Tell your sister what you think and let her do what she wants with that information, don't just invite yourself into the middle of it.", "NTA", "I see where the rhetoric is coming from, your sister needs therapy before anything good can happen in that household. I feel like this should be considered a form of abuse. Denying a child the right to acknowledge the deceased parent or a raising their deceased parent should be considered  some form of emotional abuse surely.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your step-sister sounds like a wicked step-mom, no wonder the kids were upset.", "NTA. Trying to teach your niece and nephews empathy is important. Your sister remarried 9 months into dating. That was surely hard for the husband's previous children. We often read stories like this from the other side. It seems like your sister hasn't developed much empathy since her childhood if she's still forcing her view on what makes a family onto her stepchildren.", "NTA. Your niece's father it sounds like is a deadbeat that she never knew, the boys had a mother they loved die. It wasn't the same situation. How would your niece feel if her mother died & stepfather got married to someone who wanted to be a mother to her? My guess is Zhe wouldn't see it as a great thing to happen to her.", "NTA. Sister out of line.", "Hopefully they get the message and leave forever", "Exactly they need to understand how unwanted they are. Maybe they csn live at a different family members", "Someone had to do it.", "Are you serious?", "NTA\n\nIve seen several step-family posts over the last few days and they all have the same thing in common - the adults thought that their families would just seamlessly blend, that everyone would love each other and that none of the children would harbor anger, resentment, pain or unresolved grief. I suspect that the older children\u2019s grief wasn\u2019t factored in by anyone.", "Their older siblings do hate them. The idea that the little kids were the best thing for the older kids is totally wrong. And parent(s) setting the kids up for this are REALLY doing all their ,ids a disservice. But, it's also wrong for you to step into their family dynamic & try to explain the whole situation to the littles. Perhaps better to offer up an \"I'm sorry your feelings are hurt\" & give the time honored, hated word \"You'll understand when you're older.\"\n\nI was raised in a blended family so I can't judge this", "NTA", "INFO: Have you ever opened up to your sister about how your Dad's death affected you? It seems as she has no memories of her bio Dad, and her marriage worked out in her eldest's favour, she genuinely cannot comprehend how unimaginably cruel she's being to two kids who just want not to be punished for acknowledging their late Mum.", "I\u2019m sorry, but your sister is part of the problem.\n\nShe is going to drive a wedge between the kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou might have salvaged the relationship between your niece and the older children, since now your niece might be more empathetic about their mother passing away. The older children might actually want to have a relationship with her if she's not constantly telling them it's the best thing ever that their mother died.", "But her stepkids ARE right! Just because she doesn't want them to be right, doesn't mean she gets to stomp all over their feelings! You are NTA but your sister sure is! No wonder they're not healing with someone like her in charge!", "op=NTA\n\nyour sister is going to alienate her stepkids(if she hasn't already done so).\n\nSo the stepkids are about 16 & 17/18?  Yup, those kids are looking to sign out already thanks to your sister's demand that everyone live/accept her reality.\n\nIt was good that you tried to explain to niece(and nephews) that the elder two have a right to how they feel and that they can continue to mourn the loss of their mother.", "NTA. \n\nI think you gave your niece a great perspective on the situation that she likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten from anyone else. I do think it would have been best to include your sister in the conversation, but in saying this, it sounds like she\u2019s insecure about the family dynamic, is likely struggling with kids behind the scenes + is defensive on behalf of her kids which is probably why she lashed out like that. Her step kids absolutely have the right to feel the way that they do. Of course your sister and niece and nephews aren\u2019t the best thing to happen them - having their mum still be alive would be! I hope your sister eventually comes to understand that without taking that personally. \n\nAt the end of the day, you helped your niece and nephews understand his kids\u2019 perspective and their pain. However I think it\u2019s really important all kids are listened to and their feelings are validated. Your niece had every right to be upset and hurt. I know his kids are hurting and they need support, but they also have to learn that lashing out this way can be hurtful to their step- and half-siblings. Please note - I am not saying there is a right way to grieve or that his kids shouldn\u2019t be allowed to lash out. It\u2019s totally normal to! I absolutely did when I lost my dad. I just mean that they have to understand that lashing out isn\u2019t the best solution and that they should try to find other ways to express themselves. \n  \nWorth looking into group / family therapy? I really hope everyone can grieve, process and heal together.", "This doesn't necessarily mean they're not dealing with it, it just means this is their truth and it will always be their truth. They can think their current family is great and still know it would have been better for them if their mother was there. Ops sister is hurting all of these kids by not explaining this to all of them in the way op did", "Agreed. And if she doesn\u2019t let the kids grieve, I can imagine she also doesn\u2019t let her husband grieve his deceased wife. I know it\u2019s tough being with a widow/widower, but it\u2019s important to acknowledge they will never stop loving and missing their deceased partner. Doesn\u2019t mean they love you any less", "They can also think their current family is not great at all.", "Of course", "NTA!!", ">She also told me I shouldn't bring \"our dad\" (she means my stepdad but she always called and saw him as our dad because she was younger than me when dad died and mom remarried).\n\nAt this point the sister is understanding her daughter because they're both in that situation. The step parent is the only person they known. OP and the step niblings known their other parent before the step parent so OP can see where they're coming from.\n\nOP, try talking to your sister again when she cools down.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  You were trying to support the kids and explain the difference between having a bio parent and a step parent.

What really happened was mom told her bio kids their step and half siblings were being *silly* and that the way their family is absolutely 100% perfect.", "They don't necessarily hate them. They miss their mother who they lost at an incredibly young age, have some compassion.", "Agreed. It\u2019s one thing to lack a parent because they\u2019re out there somewhere taking zero interest or responsibility for their child. A world away is losing a good and loving parent to death. That will always hurt. Nobody has the right to intrude on someone else\u2019s grief. It seems OP told the truth and told it well.

You sister is making a huge mistake and setting herself up for a disaster by how she\u2019s handling this situation. There are several recent posts on AITA from now adults who describe how bad their relationships are with their stepmom and dad because of this very thing. If you can find them, share the posts and comments with your sister. She needs to honor the memory of those kids mom and always be mindful of the huge loss they suffered. While it may have worked out for the best for her, it didn\u2019t for them. You did the right thing.", "What on earth makes you think the stepkids aren't dealing with their mother's death? Are you buying into the stepmother's notion that they must think she and her daughter are the best thing that ever happened to them? They lost their mother; no one will ever replace her (nor should anyone try). That doesn't mean they can't come to love their stepmother, stepsister, and half siblings \u2013 but that won't happen if stepmom forces things on them.", "NTA And honestly your sister is a piece of work. She basically just told her stepchildren that there pain makes her happy. That's rather disgusting.", "Someone needed to explain it to them because otherwise the stepsiblings are only gonna get a whole lot meaner", "Your sister is being TA, just because she is happy whitewashing the bio dad of her eldest out of the picture is not a good enough reason to minimise/erase the older kids mother. Good on you for explaining this in a way the young ones could understand. \n\nA big NTA.", "Yes, I have told her about it. She simply cannot understand it from my perspective."]}
