My MIL's dog just had a litter of puppies about 14 weeks ago and she's said multiple times my step son can have pick of the litter for his birthday, free of charge.

He doesn't hang out too much with my dog but that's also because my dog is more of a one person type of dog and she is basically by my side 24/7 so it makes it a bit difficult to bond with her. \n\nWell, we went to MILs house this morning for my step sons early birthday party and my MIL cornered me and basically asked me to convince my wife to let my step son have the dog because she wanted to give the dog to my son today since we were all here for his birthday anyhow. I told her I would talk to her. Well, I did try. I told my wife that I didn't think it was fair that she won't let him have the puppy and that he should be able to have the dog because it teaches him responsibility and gives him a companion to grow up with. She immediately lost it on me. Saying \"oh so you're going to disrespect me now too? I said no.

You're giving your wife the dog too.\n\nWho's going to be walking it 24/7? (Or putting it outside) - not your son. You and your wife will be doing that.\n\nVet visits? Bills? Making sure the puppy doesn't chew everything up (because they DO) - you going to watch it 24/7?\n\nIt's like having a kid when only one parent actually wants it.\n\nYour kid doesn't NEED a dog.", "YTA. You are sharing a home and she'll end up with extra responsibilities. She has been clear from the start, and MIL's prodding doesn't make your wife's opinion less valuable. \n\nWhy not get your step son closer to your dog instead?", "YTA \u201cI get that she doesn\u2019t like added responsibility\u201d I think it is definitly more about taking care of the dogs rather than her not being a \u201cdog person. \u201c you say this will teach the son responsibility to take care of it\u2026but in reality who will be waking up with the puppy to go potty at night? Driving to vet appointments? Buying food? \n\nHaving a new puppy that you love and want is hard enough. Not wanting the dog makes it even more difficult and could lead to her resenting you. Don\u2019t do it. A 10yr old cannot fully take care of a puppy and she will get stuck with it.", "Are you going to clean up after the puppy every time it has an accident? Replace all the stuff it chews up? Take it to the vet for all its shots? Crate train it?\n\nOf course not.  Your wife will get stuck with all those tasks. THAT\u2019S WHY SHE DOESN\u2019T WANT A PUPPY.\n\nYTA", "YTA- she made it clear she doesn\u2019t want the dog. With a valid reason of not wanting the extra responsibility. Y\u2019all will be taking care of it not the 10 year old. Dogs aren\u2019t cheap. She realizes this and you don\u2019t. Unfair and don\u2019t get a dog *that isn\u2019t wanted. Dog deserves to be in a home wanted by all.", "INFO: where is the part of your post where you agree to take over ALL the responsibility (including financial) for stepsons dog till the dog dies (so even if you should split up whats not unlikely reading how fed up your wife is already with you not taking care of your dog 24/7 and her having to support you)? Bc i missed that part. \n\nAnd i mean ALL the responsibility - also during your work hours.", "YTA. She's expressed multiple times she doesn't want a dog and you and your MIL are literally harassing her about it.\n\n>Not a single one of you gives a flying fuck about my opinion anyways\n\nIt's pretty clear that both you and your MIL have a history of ignoring your wife's opinion", "The current dog is by your side 24/7 or your wife takes care of it while you are at work.  Pick one.\n\n Are you going to be taking the puppy to work with you or is your son going to be taking it to school? If not, whose responsibility will a new puppy be during the day? YTA. If your wife refuses to take care of either of them, what arrangements have you put in place?", "YTA. You said your wife doesn\u2019t spend time with your dog outside of  \u201cwhat she has to\u201c. That\u2019s the telltale sentence right there because she should not have to do anything for a pet she did not want. A puppy requires a great deal of time and energy for the first year or two. So unless you\u2019re going to be the one to stay home and make sure that puppy Is taken out every three or four hours until they are potty trained, cleans up every single accident, feeds, walks and socializes her, takes her to all vet visits and harps on the step son to take care of his dog, you are the AH. Sorry, I\u2019m a dog lover and you can\u2019t force a dog on some who doesn\u2019t want one. It\u2019s not fair to the dog or the person.", "YTA. You feel your wife is being \u201cridiculous\u201d because she is the one who has to take care of your dog and now her son\u2019s dog when it is not her responsibility but yours!!! She also has the added responsibility of cooking, cleaning, making lunches, helping with homework and attending school events; yet, \u201cyou feel\u201d she is ridiculous for not wanting to take on more. Additionally, your MIL isn\u2019t advocating for your stepson she is looking out for herself by unloading the unwanted puppies on anyone she can including her own daughter. \n\nOP it is easy to criticize others when they don\u2019t want to do something you want them to do because you haven\u2019t experienced what they have. You don\u2019t respect your wife\u2019s boundaries, opinions or feelings. Well, guess what? If you continually invalidate her feelings and concerns and push forth your own agenda one day she will question what is the benefit of having a relationship with you and the answer will be \u201cno benefit at all.\u201d \n\nMark this day on the calendar so in the future so when your wife begins to become more resentful towards you every time you pull this crap and you ask yourself when did everything go so wrong you will have a record. You are jerk and need to do better!", "Yta. She said no. And she shouldn't be force to raise a puppy. Potty training sucks and she will 100% have to help with that. A 10 year old doesn't need a puppy to learn responsibility. And what happens when they move out? Chances are they will be living in a dorm or apartment where dogs aren't allowed. The dog will be her responsibility more than your son's and she told you she doesn't want that responsibility.", "YTA dogs are indeed a big responsibility. With you going to work your wife has to take care of the dog. With your son going to school and everything, all the responsibility will fall on your wife. Also she said multiple times that she hates dogs. Maybe try some different pets other than a dog?", "YTA, big time. You know full well your wife doesn't want or like dogs but you've \"bigged up\" the your son getting a dog thing despite her opinion. The way you're going with this you'll end up with 2 dogs and no wife.", "YTA. \n\nYou said it twice and still don't get it. \n\nSHE DOESN'T WANT THE ADDED RESPONSIBILITY. \n\nSince she is the one who takes care of the dogs (and the house and the kid and you) she gets the final say,  NOT you,  NOT her son and NOT her mom.", "YTA. \n\nDogs are a huge investment of time and money. Do you have the time and the desire to devote the amount of time and work a dog requires to properly caring for a dog, teaching your son to care for the dog, and making sure it's done?  I'd say apparently not, since your wife is currently having to care for the dog you currently have. \n\nIf *you* want a dog or want your kids to have one, then the dog needs to be entirely your responsibility. Your wife should not ever walk it, feed it, water it, scoop its poop, or clean up any mess it makes.  She should never arrange for its care if you plan to travel. If you and/or your son are not home, you arrange for a kennel or a dog-sitter. If it's a kennel, you both take the dog there before you leave and pick it up when you return. You take it to every vet appointment. If it starts howling in the night, you wake up to go and take care of it. The absolute most your wife should ever do is pick up a bag of food if it's sold at a store she's already shopping at anyway. \n\nBut if you expect your wife to care for your dog in any way, then she absolutely gets to say no.", "YTA, \nI completely understand why she'll blow up at you, because none of you, not you and not the child who's ten will take care of that dog and she has to now take care of not one but two dogs. \n\nThe only way to actually get that dog for your son is if you'll be solely responsible for it but from the looks of things you won't. So yea.", "I'm a dog person. I would not give a 10-year-old a puppy.\n\n* 10-year-olds are not developmentally ready to reliably meet an animal's needs when there is other, more interesting things to do. If you give a child a dog you need to be prepared to care for the dog.\n\n* 10-year-olds grow up. You cannot even begin to predict what the child's life will be like in 10 years but with luck the dog will be alive. If you do give a child a dog you need to be prepared to ensure that the dog always has a home.\n\n* Puppies take time, energy, and effort to raise correctly. 10-year-olds will need a lot of support to do that well. \n\nAside from that, it would appear that even though your dog is \"by your side 24/7,\" more of her care falls to your wife than she's comfortable with. She doesn't seem \"over the top.\" You seem dismissive and as if you really don't care about dogs -- because the odds of a good life for a puppy given to a 10-year-old without a lot more adult support than you appear willing to provide are not great. \n\nAlso, your wife doesn't have to \"like added responsibility\" being dumped on her by a mother and spouse who don't see why she should get to decide how much pet care she's willing to do. YTA, and so is your MIL.", "This is one of those \u20182 yes/ 1 no\u2019 situations. Bringing a dog in to the home is essentially adopting a new family member, and if everybody isn\u2019t on board, then it\u2019s not fair to the dog.\n\nPlus, your wife will be responsible for most of the care of the puppy since:\n\n1. You are at work a lot of the time and\n\n 2. Your step son is 10. Let\u2019s be honest, even if he takes to caring for the dog, it will take a lot of practice for him to start pulling his weight. \n\n3. It\u2019s a PUPPY. It has to be housebroken and trained.\n\n4. The fact that you will be introducing two strange dogs to each other should be heavily considered, as well.\n\nI get where you are coming from, but this just doesn\u2019t seem tenable without wife on board.\n\nYTA", "YTA , The three of you are pressuring her to take on a responsibility she doesn't want to take on, when she's already said No multiple times. This is disrespectful enough by the three of you to start with.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether your Wife is a Dog or Cat person. Puppies are hard work compared to Adult Dogs...... who do you think will be taking on the extra responsibility if you're not there? It certainly won't be your Stepson.", "YTA. Her son is not being denied getting a dog. He can absolutely get a dog when he\u2019s an adult with a job who can take care of his own pet.", "I don't think she dislikes dogs, but I think you are very unaware of how things actually are. She doesn't want to take care of another dog, the kid is 10 he won't take care of the dog. He might feed it a couple times for a couple months but after the initial wonder of a new puppy passes, guess who is gonna be stuck with a dog they never wanted? She seems frustrated with your dog as is because it sounds like you give her more responsibility with your dog that what you let on. Besides a 10 year old isn't gonna bathe a dog, isn't gonna trim nails, isn't gonna take it to the vet for vaccines. I don't think either of you is the asshole here but I also think you're being unrealistic", "YTA\n\nYou have a dog that your wife doesn't want, and yet you apparently expect your wife to take care of your dog.

If the stepson is a dog person, he already has a dog in the house to love on. A puppy is hard work for everyone in the household if you want to raise a good, well-trained animal.", "YTA your wife doesn't like dogs but she's compromised and let yours in, now you want to push it and bring another dog in. A dog that she will have to pick up the slack on if your stepson doesn't step up and also one she'll have to keep when and if he goes to college. You're incredibly selfish.", "of course a 10 yo wants a puppy! but, do you *sincerely* think a 10 yo will help manage care like an adult can? do you really want your wife to resent dogs *even more* now because you *forced* another dog in the home? do you want to hear how your wife hates having two dogs in the house when she already didn't want one? YTA.", "YTA. I'm not a dog person. I hate dogs. My husband loves dogs. He has always wanted one. I also work at home and he does not, so like your wife, part of the care falls on me. \n\nThere's a way to do it right, and a way to do it wrong. \n\nMy husband talked often about wanting one, and I knew how badly he wanted one. He was thinking of a bulldog, but said because I was the one who wasn't on board, I could pick the dog if we ever got one. \n\nFor my part, I spent a LONG time doing independent research into the behaviors, personalities, and needs of different dogs. \n\nI finally found a maltipoo from a breeder that puts the puppies through full training before sending them home. The one I found was fully trained, temperament tested to be extremely calm, and was described as \"rarely barks\". My husband was initially a bit surprised by the small breed but once he did some research he was in love with the dog also. \n\nWe've had him a year and a half now, and it has been exactly as I expected. He lays on his bed all day while I work, arrived fully crate trained, loves long walks, never has accidents, and NEVER barks. I hate dogs in general, and truthfully I still prefer life without a dog, but this one has integrated nicely into our family and we are all happy. \n\nIf my husband had done it the way you are, it would have been a disaster - everyone would be miserable, INCLUDING THE DOG. They can feel when they are not wanted.", "YTA. It's fine to want your SS to have a dog, but your wife said no and she's bio parent. It also seems that she's the one that will be taking care of it, which she doesn't want to do. Your kid can get a dog when he lives on his own, until then it's a mutual decision and she said no. You shouldn't have pressed, and she's absolutely not being \"ridiculous\". You chose to support MiL over wife, which is almost never a good idea. She's your ride or die and doesn't want another dog.

This is her decision. You already make her take care of your dog. A ten year old cannot take care of a dog on his own. You apparently can\u2019t even take care of a dog on your own. So who\u2019s going to take care of her son\u2019s dog? I guess it\u2019s not just you, MIL and her son.", "YTA and so is your MIL. Such decisions must have the approval of both parents, and not the grandparents.\nA dog is not a doll. Especially now that she is a puppy, she need constant care. \nYour step son is a kid. How can you be so sure that he will take care of her constantly and properly?\nYou'll need to take her to the vet when needed, and I dont think you'll let your son to take her for a walk all alone.\nBecause when a dog is a puppy is cute and everything, but when she grows up?\nAlso, taking care of and animal costs money. Who will pay all expenses? If your wife works and you have a joint account, you'll use that money to pay for everything?\nAnd one last thing: have you thought about whether your dog will accept the presence of another dog?", "YTA\n\nLet me explain something obvious: if you\u2019re an adult, you get to veto any pets from moving in with you.\n\nThe kid can still interact with dogs elsewhere.", "ESH - Getting a dog is a family decision. The split decision here means someone is going to lose out.\n\nClearly, your wife doesn't want the current dog, let alone another one. also, she looks after the dog all day whilst you are at work? Com'on, really? Dogs normally sleep while their owner's are at work (unless the owner is gone for too long, then they might get separation anxiety).\n\nYour stepson has had hopes rallied up by the MIL and you without checking over with your wife first. Either your wife is the bad guy, or you and the MIL will be.\n\nBTW, if you end up getting the puppy, you are the actual person responsible for it. It may be your stepsons, but you're the adult wanting to take it home.", "\nIt is almost a universal truth that children are attracted to pets. Clearly it's a strong current in the human psyche. It should be encouraged when possible. So many lifelong advantages can be fostered by time spent with dogs.\n\nMy dad didn't want the responsibility of a dog, but I happened to be granted permission to get a dog when I was 10 years old. I wouldn't be who I am today if that hadn't happened. It was the most formative event in my life. I lose composure when I see an old photo of us together, she meant that much to me. Haven't spent a day without a dog since.\n\nSo to everyone slamming OP because they think children can't possibly be responsible for a dog- Ever heard of Lassie? The household story of the bond between kids and dogs? Perhaps caring for an animal is a way for children to learn things that a screen won't provide them. It's been happening for hundreds of years.\n\nI'm not saying your wife's opinion doesn't matter. Clearly we all have different situations and there are valid reasons to decline getting a dog. \n\nMy point, to others who are slinging some mud, is that OP's heart is in the right place.

Your wife already doesn't like taking care of your grown dog, and now you're trying to force 10x that much work on her with a puppy, and trying to make her out to be the bad guy.\n\nA pet is a household decision, period.", "This is the answer.", "YTA. I love dogs, but puppies are a nightmare as far as the work and patience required. Do not do this to the dog or your wife if you want to stay married", "Yep. This is why she doesn\u2019t want another dog. It has nothing to do with the dog and everything to do with your lack of taking care of said dog. She has years of evidence that she is the one that will take care of the \u201cugly side\u201d of dog ownership. Puppies are hard work and no child will do it. Read that again. No child will take care of the ugly side of puppies and your wife knows this. She can see the future and it is not bright for her cleaning up dogshit. Every single dogshit she cleans up will be another nail in the coffin of your relationship.", "You are kind, but the refusal of the step dad to hear the word no, respect it, and to undermine his wife is pure AH behavior", "If I were the wife I would be 100% hands off since she said 'no', if you bring the dog home...and it's not even your kid? Does he spend time with his bio dad? Does he want a dog while he has custody?\n\nGood luck when the kids becomes a tween/ teen and finds out about girls and drinking and dirbltbikes or sports or the novelty just plain wears off. \n\n15 years in animal welfare. #1 reason for surrender? Kids no longer interested. #1 time of year when senior pets are surrendered? Fall... when the kids go of to college. (This dog will be 8 then)\n\nOh and our #2 reason for surrender? Unable to afford/find dog friendly housing due to divorce.\n\nYTA and so is her mother.", "People ask me sometimes if I\u2019m ever going to get another dog for my kids since we lost our senior lady 2.5 years ago. I always tell them \u201cI might as well have another baby.\u201d Dogs in general can be a lot of work, but puppies are even worse and often take as much care and attention as a newborn. And at least newborns poop in diapers. \n\nWe\u2019ll get another dog when they\u2019re older, but right now my 4 and 1 year old are the closest to puppies we\u2019ll have in the house.", "Yeah. And a ten year old will absolutely not be able to keep up with the work of potty training a puppy. You have to take them out like every hour for awhile and even ideally once or more in the middle of the night. This kid goes to school all day, mom is going to be the one doing all the potty breaks and cleaning up accidents. And that\u2019s not even including all the work of leash training and basic obedience training. A ten year old will absolutely need help with all of that."]}
