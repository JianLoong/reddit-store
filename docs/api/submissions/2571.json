You respected the boys\u2019 wishes. That is all that matters. If your sister truly cared for the boys\u2019 needs instead of just her wants, she would have accepted this and allowed this to progress at the boys\u2019 pace. Instead, she started a scorched earth strategy by getting the whole family against you. \n\nThe only people\u2019s\u2019 feeling who you need to take into account here is the boys\u2019. Everyone else\u2019s is secondary to them.", "NTA. Sounds like you are doing everything right and have a team of experts looking out for your boys\u2019 wellbeing. Great job, Dad.", "NTA. You're taking cues from the kids, the people whose opinions matter most. They are resolute (you went the extra mile to confirm this) in not wanting to have contact with her, everyone needs to respect that.", "They're almost grown and they should be allowed to decide for themselves. It has to have been pretty bad for a child to not want to see their parent. Starting to pressure the child will only result in them losing trust in you. \n\n\n\"I won't force them to see her/you\". Keep it simple. If your family won't respect you, take a step back from them for a while. Your immediate family at home will always take priority. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you are following their social worker advice.\n\nIgnore your family and sister.\n\nI would keep an eye out for other family members pressuring the boys to see their bio mom.", "NTA. I read another post similar to this where the guy waited 10 yrs and not before he had a new gf to reconnect with his kids. I called him the AH and this is no different. Both examples should have made the effort way, way sooner.", "NTA.  No. No. NO!  You asked them and they answered.  They are NOT ready to see her.  I love that she has accused you of brainwashing these kids to turn against her.  The fact that she abandoned them (and I have to wonder what their life was like before she left) has NOTHING to do with it.  The oh so helpful family members need to butt the hell out.  You've discussed this with social worker and the kids' therapist - you don't need any of the family voicing their worthless opinions.  If you \"try harder\" then it will just be you pressuring these kids to see this person against their wishes which is exactly what you don't want.  Please keep being an advocate and good parent to these kids.  They come first!", "NTA you don't get to discard your children  & then expect them to want to be around you. Children have feelings, oh so many feelings, & your sister needs to learn that even if she begs for their forgiveness, it isn't automatic or mandatory that they give her theirs.", "NTA. The kids are all old enough to have an opinion about this,  and it didn't sound like any of them even hesitated on that opinion.", "The children have expressed their choice. If you talked more they might get the idea you are leaning on them to see her, and you don't want that. Your family should be told that they can have an opinion when they adopt those boys. NTA", "NTA. Good on you for respecting them.", "\"I find it utterly bizarre that you think I should ignore the advice of professionals who know the boys. I am distressed that you think it is in any way appropriate to disregard the boys' clearly expressed wishes and instead force them to interact with the woman who abandoned them. The very fact that Emilia doesn't care that a visit could traumatize the boys because *her* needs are more important is proof that I am doing the right thing. I genuinely hope she grows up and can learn to prioritize someone else's needs over her own selfish desires, but she clearly hasn't yet. If you are in touch with her, you might want to encourage her to work on herself so that, if the boys do someday decide they want to see her, she is mature enough to handle the visit. In the meantime, I consider the topic closed and I will not be discussing it further.\"\n\nNTA. Good job on prioritizing your boys, in the face of pressure and harassment.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve asked the children themselves, and all the professionals engaged in their well-being agrees with the outcome here. This isn\u2019t about your family or your sister\u2019s feelings or \u201cgiving her a chance.\u201d You\u2019re protecting the kids.", "Let me first say thank you for saving those kids from the system. It's a messy one. Second, nta. You clearly only want what's best for these kids. You are doing everything you should be.", "NTA - looks like you are the only one who has those boys' best interest at heart. Continue in not influencing them about this.\n\nI do think that you should not have passed your sister over to the social worker - you should have told her yourself.  That might make you look shady to her.", "NTA. I presume you're raising them as if they're your own children. She can't just decide to give them up and come back into their lives all willy-nilly whenever she wants. It'll mess with their heads. Def NTA", "NTA.  She either surrendered them willingly or was so dangerous a parent they were removed from her.  For her to give up / lose custody of those boys so late in their lives must have been incredibly traumatic for them.  Add to the fact that she has not even tried to contact them for 4 years?  She emotionally abandoned them!!  No brainwashing necessary!  She does N O T get to drop back into their lives unasked.  Y O U are now their parent responsible for promoting their health, happiness, and best interests.  You are doing everything right in terms of checking with the boys and checking with the therapists.  If the boys do not want to see the person who was formerly their mother, please continue to respect that.  You are doing such a great job and they are so lucky to have you!!!", "NTA. They're not her boys, they're yours. She lost the right to be their parent and she doesn't get to just show up for the fun stuff now. You are their dad and you need to protect them. They don't want to see her. It's not healthy for them to see her. It's as simple as that. Anyone who doesn't understand that clearly isn't putting the boys first. Good for YOU for doing just that!", "The boys didn\u2019t waiver or give an uncertain answer\u2026they consistently gave a vehement and definitive no to each person that posed the question. \n\nYou correctly gave them the autonomy to make their own decision and your sister needs to respect them enough to abide by their wishes. She doesn\u2019t have the right to force contact on them and she needs to put their well-being ahead of her ego. \n\nNTA", "NTA and it sounds like other than the social worker you're the only one actually looking out for the kid's best interests. Block the sis and tell her to go through the SW from now on, and consider going low contact with your family too until they get the message.", "NTA.  And I repeat NTA.  She doesn't get to wander back in and pretend to care after all this time.  As for the family and the little flying monkeys, where are they in caring for her children?  My bet, absent.  Block 'em.   And listen to the boys, they don't want to see her, they don't see her.", "Definitely not the asshole. An asshole wouldn't care about the children's wishes.", "NTA\n\nDamaged relationships between children and parents are heartbreaking situations. You were correct to reach out to the social worker and speak to the children. They decided what they wanted for themselves. That in no way means that this is a completely closed case though. The kids should be allowed to reconsider what they want in regards to their relationship with their parent whenever they want to. Damage on such a fundamental level can have life long impacts on them as individuals; when we possible it is typically best for the children and the parent to attempt to resolve the issue to some degree, with supervision.", "NTA. You seem to be the only one who's primary concern is the boys' wellbeing. They are old enough to make this decision, and you are right to respect it", "NTA at all. The most important thing here is that the kids wants, needs, and boundaries are honored. I\u2019m really sorry that you don\u2019t have the support of your family, I know that\u2019s super painful and can cause one to question themself, you\u2019re doing the right thing here though", "NTA Their social worker knows what they're doing. She gave them up. That's a lot of heartbreak that they'll need to heal. They should see her when/if they're ready. \n\nAs long as you let them know that they can change their minds later, you've done your part. I honestly wouldn't ask them again because they may feel like they're being pressured to give a different answer. Just let them know the door is there should they ever want to open it.", "So you think you should push them to want to se their mom bc other people think you\u2019re an a hole! I hate to break it to you but that WOULD make you the a hole. You are respecting their wishes. They talked to the social worker AND their therapists. Three people have talked to them about this. And I hate to break it to you but if she has to have supervised visitation with you AND the social worker...she did some pretty crappy stuff. They have every right to not want contact with her and you should respect that. You did the RIGHT thing!!! If others don\u2019t like it they can suck it. (Whatever it is. LOL)", "NTA. She left them and you opened your heart and home so they didn't end up apart and in foster care. They are old enough to decide what they want. Tell your family to back off before they don't want to see them either.", "NTA", "NTA. They don't want to see her and the State agrees. That's that.", "NTA and I would cut off anyone that is against what is best for the boys and trying to go against their wishes.", "NTA. Correction. You\u2019re their mom. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter if a 1000 people are telling you you\u2019re an AH. Your job is to keep your kids happy and feeling safe. And you\u2019re doing exactly that.", "NTA\n\n\nSeems like your sister and family are refusing to see that actions have consequences.\n\n\nWhatever your sister did that led to this arrangement had to be traumatic enough that they don't want to see her.  You can't force them, and nor should you.  They are old enough to decide and if your family wants to talk crap, let them, but make sure to remind them that they are pointing the finger at the wrong sibling.", "NTA. Looks like the mother hasn\u2019t been humbled by the situation and that\u2019s a shame. If she really wants to reconnect, she will need to come to terms with the fact that it might take a lot of time to regain trust. Maybe even never. That is up to the children. \n\nYou are doing a wonderful job. Your family may not see it right now, but we sure do!", "NTA.\n\nFirst, you're a saint for adopting those boys.  You're a good person for not airing all of your sister's issues, but it is understood she had lots of issues if she gave up her parental rights and hasn't seen the boys in 4 years.\n\nThe boys have a good life now.  Their memories of their birth mom are NOT all happy memories.  I assume there was a good bit of chaos, some neglect, and possibly even abuse. There is no reason they should have to relive that, or be worried that they will be returned to her.\n\nAs for your \"whole family being turned against you\" I'm going to say that it's really easy to make a comment on Facebook to get someone (her) off their back.  And it's really easy for her to make it seem like you're the one keeping her from them. Her support from your family is, as they say, a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nHold your head high, keep doing what is best for YOUR boys, and just disengage from heckling from the cheap seats.", "NTA ask your family why they don\u2019t care about what the kids want? She\u2019s done enough damage and if she truly cared about them she wouldn\u2019t behave like this and they know it", "NTA\n\nYou've had multiple people who's literal job is to put the best interest of those children first talk to them. All those professionals have said that it wasn't in the kids best interest. You have done nothing wrong. \n\nI don't know if it would do any good to let family know why and how this decision has been made. I don't know if you and the kids have a close relationship with the extended family. Will they start pressuring the children to meet with their mother? \n\nIf they will you need to tell them all what the social worker and therapist have said. Let family know any attempt to guilt or talk the children into changing their minds will be seen as a direct violation of the boundaries that have been set to ensure the children's mental well being. That limited contact with them could well be a result of those actions.\n\nMake a clear stand now so there is no confusion as to the consequences of their actions.", "NTA. You did good. Just remember to be open in the future in case they bring it up and change their mind. Until then you did all you need to. \n\n Enjoy your time with them, they grow up fast!", "NTA they don't wanna meet her and it's their choice.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Don't let them bully you.  If you try to force them to see their birth mom, it will not go well.  The social worker and therapists gave you guidance and you followed it.", "NTA. You did your part.", "NTA\n\nWithout knowing how these kids came to be in your care instead of remaining in hers, and knowing that you've got the children's thoughts on whether or not they wanna meet her, I say you did everything in the children's best interest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
