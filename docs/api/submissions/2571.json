You respected the boys\u2019 wishes. That is all that matters.

Instead, she started a scorched earth strategy by getting the whole family against you. \n\nThe only people\u2019s\u2019 feeling who you need to take into account here is the boys\u2019.

They are resolute (you went the extra mile to confirm this) in not wanting to have contact with her, everyone needs to respect that.", "They're almost grown and they should be allowed to decide for themselves. It has to have been pretty bad for a child to not want to see their parent. Starting to pressure the child will only result in them losing trust in you. \n\n\n\"I won't force them to see her/you\".

I read another post similar to this where the guy waited 10 yrs and not before he had a new gf to reconnect with his kids. I called him the AH and this is no different. Both examples should have made the effort way, way sooner.", "NTA.  No. No. NO!  You asked them and they answered.  They are NOT ready to see her.  I love that she has accused you of brainwashing these kids to turn against her.  The fact that she abandoned them (and I have to wonder what their life was like before she left) has NOTHING to do with it.  The oh so helpful family members need to butt the hell out.  You've discussed this with social worker and the kids' therapist - you don't need any of the family voicing their worthless opinions.  If you \"try harder\" then it will just be you pressuring these kids to see this person against their wishes which is exactly what you don't want.  Please keep being an advocate and good parent to these kids.  They come first!", "NTA you don't get to discard your children  & then expect them to want to be around you. Children have feelings, oh so many feelings, & your sister needs to learn that even if she begs for their forgiveness, it isn't automatic or mandatory that they give her theirs.", "NTA. The kids are all old enough to have an opinion about this,  and it didn't sound like any of them even hesitated on that opinion.", "The children have expressed their choice.

I am distressed that you think it is in any way appropriate to disregard the boys' clearly expressed wishes and instead force them to interact with the woman who abandoned them. The very fact that Emilia doesn't care that a visit could traumatize the boys because *her* needs are more important is proof that I am doing the right thing. I genuinely hope she grows up and can learn to prioritize someone else's needs over her own selfish desires, but she clearly hasn't yet. If you are in touch with her, you might want to encourage her to work on herself so that, if the boys do someday decide they want to see her, she is mature enough to handle the visit. In the meantime, I consider the topic closed and I will not be discussing it further.\"\n\nNTA. Good job on prioritizing your boys, in the face of pressure and harassment.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve asked the children themselves, and all the professionals engaged in their well-being agrees with the outcome here.

She can't just decide to give them up and come back into their lives all willy-nilly whenever she wants. It'll mess with their heads. Def NTA", "NTA.  She either surrendered them willingly or was so dangerous a parent they were removed from her.  For her to give up / lose custody of those boys so late in their lives must have been incredibly traumatic for them.  Add to the fact that she has not even tried to contact them for 4 years?  She emotionally abandoned them!!  No brainwashing necessary!  She does N O T get to drop back into their lives unasked.  Y O U are now their parent responsible for promoting their health, happiness, and best interests.  You are doing everything right in terms of checking with the boys and checking with the therapists.  If the boys do not want to see the person who was formerly their mother, please continue to respect that.  You are doing such a great job and they are so lucky to have you!!!", "NTA. They're not her boys, they're yours. She lost the right to be their parent and she doesn't get to just show up for the fun stuff now. You are their dad and you need to protect them. They don't want to see her. It's not healthy for them to see her. It's as simple as that. Anyone who doesn't understand that clearly isn't putting the boys first. Good for YOU for doing just that!", "The boys didn\u2019t waiver or give an uncertain answer\u2026they consistently gave a vehement and definitive no to each person that posed the question. \n\nYou correctly gave them the autonomy to make their own decision and your sister needs to respect them enough to abide by their wishes.

Block the sis and tell her to go through the SW from now on, and consider going low contact with your family too until they get the message.", "NTA.  And I repeat NTA.  She doesn't get to wander back in and pretend to care after all this time.  As for the family and the little flying monkeys, where are they in caring for her children?  My bet, absent.  Block 'em.   And listen to the boys, they don't want to see her, they don't see her.", "Definitely not the asshole. An asshole wouldn't care about the children's wishes.", "NTA\n\nDamaged relationships between children and parents are heartbreaking situations. You were correct to reach out to the social worker and speak to the children. They decided what they wanted for themselves. That in no way means that this is a completely closed case though. The kids should be allowed to reconsider what they want in regards to their relationship with their parent whenever they want to. Damage on such a fundamental level can have life long impacts on them as individuals; when we possible it is typically best for the children and the parent to attempt to resolve the issue to some degree, with supervision.", "NTA. You seem to be the only one who's primary concern is the boys' wellbeing. They are old enough to make this decision, and you are right to respect it", "NTA at all. The most important thing here is that the kids wants, needs, and boundaries are honored. I\u2019m really sorry that you don\u2019t have the support of your family, I know that\u2019s super painful and can cause one to question themself, you\u2019re doing the right thing here though", "NTA Their social worker knows what they're doing. She gave them up. That's a lot of heartbreak that they'll need to heal. They should see her when/if they're ready. \n\nAs long as you let them know that they can change their minds later, you've done your part. I honestly wouldn't ask them again because they may feel like they're being pressured to give a different answer. Just let them know the door is there should they ever want to open it.", "So you think you should push them to want to se their mom bc other people think you\u2019re an a hole! I hate to break it to you but that WOULD make you the a hole. You are respecting their wishes. They talked to the social worker AND their therapists. Three people have talked to them about this. And I hate to break it to you but if she has to have supervised visitation with you AND the social worker...she did some pretty crappy stuff. They have every right to not want contact with her and you should respect that. You did the RIGHT thing!!! If others don\u2019t like it they can suck it. (Whatever it is. LOL)", "NTA. She left them and you opened your heart and home so they didn't end up apart and in foster care. They are old enough to decide what they want.

That's that.", "NTA and I would cut off anyone that is against what is best for the boys and trying to go against their wishes.", "NTA. Correction. You\u2019re their ~~mom~~ parent. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter if a 1000 people are telling you you\u2019re an AH. Your job is to keep your kids happy and feeling safe. And you\u2019re doing exactly that.\n\nEdit above!", "NTA\n\n\nSeems like your sister and family are refusing to see that actions have consequences.\n\n\nWhatever your sister did that led to this arrangement had to be traumatic enough that they don't want to see her.  You can't force them, and nor should you.  They are old enough to decide and if your family wants to talk crap, let them, but make sure to remind them that they are pointing the finger at the wrong sibling.", "NTA. Looks like the mother hasn\u2019t been humbled by the situation and that\u2019s a shame. If she really wants to reconnect, she will need to come to terms with the fact that it might take a lot of time to regain trust. Maybe even never. That is up to the children. \n\nYou are doing a wonderful job. Your family may not see it right now, but we sure do!", "NTA.\n\nFirst, you're a saint for adopting those boys.  You're a good person for not airing all of your sister's issues, but it is understood she had lots of issues if she gave up her parental rights and hasn't seen the boys in 4 years.\n\nThe boys have a good life now.  Their memories of their birth mom are NOT all happy memories.  I assume there was a good bit of chaos, some neglect, and possibly even abuse. There is no reason they should have to relive that, or be worried that they will be returned to her.\n\nAs for your \"whole family being turned against you\" I'm going to say that it's really easy to make a comment on Facebook to get someone (her) off their back.  And it's really easy for her to make it seem like you're the one keeping her from them. Her support from your family is, as they say, a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nHold your head high, keep doing what is best for YOUR boys, and just disengage from heckling from the cheap seats.", "NTA ask your family why they don\u2019t care about what the kids want? She\u2019s done enough damage and if she truly cared about them she wouldn\u2019t behave like this and they know it", "NTA\n\nYou've had multiple people who's literal job is to put the best interest of those children first talk to them. All those professionals have said that it wasn't in the kids best interest. You have done nothing wrong. \n\nI don't know if it would do any good to let family know why and how this decision has been made. I don't know if you and the kids have a close relationship with the extended family. Will they start pressuring the children to meet with their mother? \n\nIf they will you need to tell them all what the social worker and therapist have said. Let family know any attempt to guilt or talk the children into changing their minds will be seen as a direct violation of the boundaries that have been set to ensure the children's mental well being. That limited contact with them could well be a result of those actions.\n\nMake a clear stand now so there is no confusion as to the consequences of their actions.", "NTA. You did good. Just remember to be open in the future in case they bring it up and change their mind. Until then you did all you need to. \n\n Enjoy your time with them, they grow up fast!", "NTA they don't wanna meet her and it's their choice.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Don't let them bully you.  If you try to force them to see their birth mom, it will not go well.  The social worker and therapists gave you guidance and you followed it.", "NTA. You did your part.", "NTA\n\nWithout knowing how these kids came to be in your care instead of remaining in hers, and knowing that you've got the children's thoughts on whether or not they wanna meet her, I say you did everything in the children's best interest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sure they have suffered a great deal of trauma. \n\nStepping in and taking on teenagers isn't easy. I've been in this same situation several times with my siblings kids. Just one of my nephews those had it way worse then the others though.\n\nHis parents had been together for 17 years my nephew (D) was 15 (turned 16 a month later) when they split up. He caught his mom cheating on the internet with several different men. He told her if she didn't tell his dad (B) he would. He wouldn't speak to his mom and his dad knew something was up. So it all eventually came out. His mom my sister (M) started meeting up with one of the men. She moved him into a studio apartment that a friend of theirs owned. B found out about this went and confronted them and he was arrested for assault. That opened the door for M to take D and they stayed with several different people she started sleeping around and using drugs and even got D using them as well. My husband and I talked to both B & M and said we will take in D we would raise him like our own and we wanted it in writing and notarized (you can do that where we live). They would still be his parents but only M had to sign because B wasn't on the birth certificate for D. We explained what was happening to our 3 daughters who were under 12. They loved the idea. Things went great at first we would take D to visit M but every time we did he would end up sick on the way home. We finally figured it out she was getting him high and he couldn't tolerate it. We stopped the visits she had to earn them back. B was still getting him on his weekends and even took over M's as well. D's councilor recommended he write his feelings down and us take the letter to her she thought it would help him get all his feelings out by reading what he wrote. It helped and did wonders for him. She didn't like it and picked a fight with me saying i was turning him against her. She pulled a shotgun on me and I tackled her D heard the noise and came running in and jumped on us to keep her down. I got the gun away from her luckily the safety was on and it was in a case (cloth). D was on the phone with my husband and he threw it at M's roommate and he told my husband what was going on and hung up. My husband called the police in the town and state we were in. ( my husband was in Missouri and we were in Illinois which is about an hour drive from each place.) He told them my wife took my nephew for a visit with his mom my SIL she pulled a gun on my wife I don't know if anyone was hurt the line went dead. My husband said that was the worst moment of his life because he didn't know what was happening since no one answered when he tried calling back. The police were there in minutes. M was arrested and taken into custody and said she wasn't going to use it on me but herself. Either way I wasn't going to let that happen. Was it dumb what I did hell yes. But my thought was is she going to go for D after me I've got to stop her. \n\nShe turned the rest of my family against me as well. Came and took D 6 Mos later then left him again for 2 weeks while she went to another state met and married a man that set her up and lied to her and catfish her on a dating site. A family friend seen D walking one day and ask him what he was doing and he told her he was going to get something to eat because his mom took off a few days before and he hasn't heard from her. That friend called B and B went and picked him up and took care of him until D was old enough to move out and be on his own. D got in trouble with the law and ended up in prison because drugs B passed away while D was in prison in 2019 from lung cancer. M had 2 more kids and lost custody of them and they were adopted about a year ago. I couldn't take them because I was taking care of our sick mother at the time and my daughters. M is living on and off the streets and still doing drugs. She refused to do what she needed to, to get her kids back. \n\nOP NTA do what you have to to keep the boys safe.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.

Those boys don't deserve the trauma and hardships of all that insanity. They may change their minds when they're older, and that's up to them, but as their legal guardian, your first priority should be to protect them and help them heal, which sounds *exactly* like what you're doing. \n\nParenthood might sometimes seem unrewarding, but I guarantee you that the boys will view you as their personal hero for listening to and respecting their wishes, and that's probably the greatest reward you could ever hope for. I'd have given **anything** to have had someone like you intervene in the trauma I and my brothers went through when we were kids. You're doing a fantastic job, absolutely NTA in case that wasn't clear.", "NTA, thank you for protecting those kids.", "NTA, they've been clear and she lost the right to make these kinds of demands.", "NTA.

Parental rights were terminated from her for a reason", "As someone in a similar situation, you\u2019re nta. My sister doesn\u2019t care about her kids and sees them when it\u2019s convenient for her. I put a stop to it and she got in a hissy fit because she\u2019s never missed a holiday. Well you missed everything else. Why does a holiday matter?", "NTA\n\nI was in the same situation with my boys father. He was abusive and a raging drug/alcohol addict. Lost custody, didn't really do much to clean himself up for a long time and when he did reach out he always messed it up by being abusive and very inappropriate with the kids.\n\nI never, ever spoke badly about him, but when the boys were old enough to ask about it I told them the truth, gently, about the situation, leaving out the worst of it until they were much older and asked. I did not volunteer the information.\n\n I also made sure to encourage them to at least try periodically to talk to their bio dad and give him a chance since people change over time. They did and would occasionally contact him via social media and/or phone, but only did in person visits when they were much older/adults. It didn't go well at all. In fact, it went so badly that they changed their last names from bio dads to my dads (their grandfather) because it was Papa who really raised them and was decent to them.\n\nSo, OP, you are doing the right thing by letting them steer this decision and only acting as  guide for their decision making process. That's what a really good parent does, especially with older teens, almost adults.\n\nI need to ask though .... if you adopted them, why is social services still involved? Does your country/state do it differently than others?", "It\u2019s not your job to talk them into a relationship with her - that\u2019s coercion. They are clearly with you for a reason, they are old enough to make their own decisions and you\u2019re right in asking them what they wanted to do. NTA, but you will be the asshole if you try to talk to them more and convince them about it when they have clearly said no.", "NTA. If you force the kids to see their parent when they said no, you will be the asshole. The kids understand what is being asked and multiple people asked. It's their mother, let them choose. Let them see her on their own time.", "NTA\n\nYou did absolutely everything right.\n\nSpoke to their social worker, the boys both together and separately, their therapist, and had the social worker and the therapist address it with them in private too. You covered every single base and made sure the boys best interests were been fulfilled. Your sister isn't thinking about what's best for them. She probably feels guilt and regret.

They\u2019re scared she might try to take them back into what they consider a worse off life. That\u2019s a compliment to you. If she hasn\u2019t been involved for 4 years and you had to take all three of them it seems obvious to me what the circumstances must\u2019ve been like. I won\u2019t assume, but I can imagine what must\u2019ve been happening. And maybe she\u2019s had a moment of clarity/sobriety, but if her life falls apart again and it affects the boys negatively you\u2019ll know you made the wrong decision. Trust yourself.

Barring a court order (and in that case, they would probably be installing a third party anyway), OP is not required to respond.

It could\u2019ve been anything, and it could\u2019ve been the right thing to do.) but if the boys do not want to see her, you cannot force them. They\u2019ll just wind up, resenting you as well and you can\u2019t make them feel uncomfortable and you can also cause some underlining psychological issues when they\u2019re older, but what you can do is let them know that if they want to or when they\u2019re ready they could meet her and you also need to explain this to her that they chose not to see her you didn\u2019t brainwash them. They just chose on their own not to see her probably because they\u2019re upset and they resent her right now and they\u2019re still hurt at her actions (even if the initial reason of her giving them up was the right thing to do for whatever reason she chose to do so) children don\u2019t understand this all they need is some time and eventually don\u2019t wanna see her and if they don\u2019t that\u2019s OK too but the choice is up to them you\u2019re doing the right thing your family and your sister are the a hole for trying to force them to have a relationship with her when they don\u2019t want to not caring about their psychological mental health or their trauma\u2026. NTA", "NTA, you asked them together, individually and involved therapist and social worker. They all made a clear a choice and are the right age to make it. They would have very good reason not want to see their mum and that should be the end of it.\n\nI get mum might be angry but what did she expect, yes the situation for her might have changed but if she wants a relationship with her sons, she is the best one who has do the work and proof that she has changed but only if they are willing to do so, as you rightly pointed out that forcing them is not in their best interest \n\nIf she has truly changed, she would have understood and accepted their choice no matter how it hurt and ensure that the lines of communication are left open if they change their minds. However, she has chosen to blame you rather than accept for whatever reason, this is the consequences of her actions.\n\nKeep doing what you are doing, showing they matter and listening to their wishes and supporting them.", ">She has managed to turn my whole family against me who are now all saying I\u2019m a AH for not giving her another chance to reconnect with them and I\u2019m starting to doubt myself.\n\nSee, I'm seething at this! You took in your sister's 4 kids!!! I'm hoping you had some help from this \"family\" calling you an AH bcs they are a bunch of deluded idiots!!! \n\nNTA, it seems that only you are looking after the kid's mental health and general well being. Sis can't just drop them and later ask to see them as if nothing happened! Kids don't want to, so it's good you are not forcing that on them! Sis should be ashamed", "NTA.

First, I commend you for taking on the parenting responsibility for 4 children at such a young age yourself. And, also... I've myself been the central hub of a team of professional experts who were all there to help my own daughter (she has a syndrome) so I've interfaced with therapists, teachers, medical professionals etc with decision making. We have that in common, and yes, you have this down... for the best interests of the children, you don't just do things thoughtlessly or recklessly. You take time to be mindful, consider the impact, gather advice, gather input, before making the call. \n\nYou made 100% the right call here. 100%. There's not a shred of doubt in my mind that even though you don't explicitly say how this arrangement came into place, the fact you have a care TEAM for those kids, and you took time to ask, verify, ask again, and give all due diligence to this? You're no rookie parent. You have experience of how shit can go fucking sideways, and how much it can harm your kids when it does. \n\nAnd I've experienced firsthand what happens when FAMILY decides to make up their willfully ignorant minds because FAMILY wants things to be a fucking Hallmark Movie instead of the daily grinding reality that we, as caregivers, ate actually dealing with. Anyone who gives you shit about this? They have NO skin in the game if it goes sideways. They are not going to deal with the fallout of kids emotionally in turmoil and their healing disrupted. \n\nI see you, Dad. You're a good person, and double checking yourself is a caretaker's job to be our best. But you did make the right call here. \n\nYou deserve, you have EARNED, way more fucking respect than you are being shown here, by your ungrateful sister and your ungrateful extended family.", "NTA.

The kids made their decisions and you consulted professionals. If you get push back from family you can 1) say the kids are still healing and 2) cut them off if they don't respect the decision. Take care OP.", "NTA. I understand the reasoning behind your family thinking you're an AH but only because I assume they don't have the whole picture. The boys don't want to see her for some reason, which I imagine has to do with why they were separated from her in the first place. \n\nGood luck with your boys, do what's best for them, not what's convenient for your family.", "NTA\n\nIf she really wanted to see them, she wouldn't have abandoned them in the first place. You can't just give up kids that age and come back around like nothing happened, especially after not even trying to talk to them over the years you were gone. Unless she gave them up because she was battling addiction or something, there was no reason for her to do that.\n\nThen to turn the rest of the family against you after YOU took in HER kids that didn't even want to see her. Those kids are definitely old enough to know that they don't want to see her, idk how someone can brainwash 15 year olds to not want to be around the mother who gave them up. The family should've been on your side with this, I can't imagine what she could've told them to turn them against you just like that", "Adoptee here: you would be an asshole if you played any part in framing the mother in a bad light to the kids, for the record. That being said I wouldn\u2019t force them, but I would keep the door open for if they change their mind. Please never trash talk or frame your sister in a bad light in front  of them.

You're doing a great job.", "NTA: Whatever she did was bad enough for her children to be removed from her care and then for 4 years she didn't bother to take any steps to reconcile the situation.\n\nYou took on the huge responsibility of raising her children.

They all decided they did not want to meet with their mother.\n\nYou did everything right.", "Why did she give them up?", "NTA and block any fam saying otherwise.", "NTA. You're an amazing father! Your kids come first. I'm glad you respect their decision.", "Up to the kids. After reading the title i came\ndirectly over to tell you YTA bc the children would resent you for it but if they have clearly said \"no,\" they have set a boundary.

Trust me, that happens, those years she was away and OP took in the boys will be \"something that should not be spoken of\"", "I would strongly suggest you talk to the kids about what to so if there is a future situation where their grandparents turn up or try and tall to them or try to get them to meet your sister.", "Yea, I\u2019d say if you had only recently taken them in, a move would be really hard on them, but after 4 years, they might benefit more from moving than from staying there surrounded by people who know the details of their worst moments. Definitely a good thing you plan to get their input though - They\u2019re old enough to have opinions on this for sure.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, you seem like a seriously amazing silver lining to these kids. Instead of dismissing them as, \u201cjust kids\u201d you get their input on things that affect them. It may seem like an obvious thing to you, but a lot of kids with trauma feel so dismissed and invalidated - It must mean the world to them to have that little bit of control after whatever their mom did to them. \n\nAlso, NTA"]}
