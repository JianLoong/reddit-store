I\u2019m also\nNot making any attempts at promotions or anything else. Lastly, there is a 5 year rule maximum for Store Managers and their Assistants before they\u2019re transferred elsewhere, so worst case scenario I have store mgmt that doesn\u2019t like me for a couple\nYears. If there was any chance of me suffering career wise or financially I wouldn\u2019t be f***ing around for sure.", "Agree", "My point about email was twofold: \n1) it limits your responses to your time, to answer in a manner of your choosing, while still being willing to help out someone that is likely struggling in their position (without any claims of pettiness).\n2) creates a paper trail of all the time you needed to spend outside of your regular 50 hrs/wk that you\u2019ll have to back up any questions regarding your salary or performance (and professionalism).", "Glad to hear it. \n\nYou have clearly thought this course of action through.\n\nSucks that management put you in this position.\n\nBest wishes.", "So it also sounds like you outsource your job to others in the guise of providing them experience. YTA", "It\u2019s actually part of the training, that they can do the job and get it signed off by a panel of managers, for which they\u2019re paid an increased salary for doing the job of a manager.  It\u2019s then signed off and they are marked \u201cpromotion ready\u201d in their employee profile. I don\u2019t outsource anything, it\u2019s the program created and applied by the company not me wtf\nAs in they perform the same tasks as me, not do my work for me while I do nothing.", "NTA it is not your job to train this person, and if management hired an inexperienced person and expect it to be your problem, then they need to offer you something pretty spectacular to step into a supervisory role.", "God no NTA. It's not your job to train the person they hired as being qualified to do their job.", "NTA", "YTA.  You could've said something like, \"I apologize but Im very busy and unable to help you, try reaching out to *their manager's name* for assistance.\" I get that you feel frustrated that the new manager isn't qualified and it isn't your job to train them, but your response was pretty unprofessional and reeked of bitterness.", "NTA. If she calls again simply refer her very politely to her manager. \" Your manager,  Tonya, should be able to help you with that.\" OR \" \" That is covered in XY Z training manual. I am sure your manager, Tony, can help you locate that. \" Respond to her in writing so your manager can see your response is polite and professional. Maybe go to Ask a Manager and ask this question on the open thread on Friday ( or Saturday?) One day is for work related questions..", "NTA\n\nPolitely start telling her to ask her managers for help.  That's their job.", "It is her fault, she applied for a job she's not qualified for and she accepted that job when she got it.", " \n\nFast track management isn't the greatest.", "It is her fault, she applied for a job she's not qualified for and she accepted that job when she got it.", "Eh, I don\u2019t know if we can say that without knowing what she was promised. The examples OP gives - reports, procedures, equipment - can definitely be company specific. New manager might have great soft skills and been promised an onboarding plan\u2026 without the company actually creating one, screwing over both her and OP.", " \n\nFast track management isn't the greatest. Merit has nothing to do with job", "That doesn\u2019t make it her fault, she\u2019s just doing what best provides for her and her family if she has one. It\u2019s the companies fault for hiring someone without the experience."]}
