{"id": 12713, "submission_id": "11vyabb", "title": "AITA for telling my wife as kindly as I could that I think she needs to accept my daughter will probably never view her as a mother?", "selftext": "I\u2019m an older dad. I was born in 1966, so I\u2019m currently 56, turning 57 this year. I really tried to do the classic way of things. You know, settle down, get married, have kids etc. I was actually married when I was young in the 90s and really wanted children but it just never happened. I dated but never really had any luck and the older I got, the more I realised I was running out of time. I was waiting around to meet the perfect woman to be a mother to my kids and in reality, it just didn\u2019t happen. So when I was still in my 40s, I made a decision to become a single dad. I used my life savings and decided to try surrogacy with an egg donor. I thought that if it didn\u2019t work, then at least I tried. I was actually quite pessimistic but I got really lucky. My beautiful little girl Cassie* was born in 2010.\n\nI adore being a dad. She is truly wonderful and even though I was 44 when she was born, I felt lucky that I was able to have a kid. I did worry that not having a mother would affect her, but she has grown up to be just as happy as a kid with two parents. I\u2019ve told her a kid friendly version of why she doesn\u2019t have a mum and she gets it. Obviously now she\u2019s 12, turning 13, I can tell her probably the full truth and I will eventually.\n\nAnyway, I married my wife Marie (50) a few months ago after 2 years of dating. I told her from the start that I\u2019m looking for a partner, not a mother for my kid as Cassie was 10. I explained that if things progressed and got very serious Cassie may very well form an attachment and want a mother figure but that I wouldn\u2019t push it and it\u2019s for Cassie to decide.\n\nCassie has decided that even though she loves Marie and is glad she is part of our family now, she is content in just calling her Marie and says that she will consider her as my wife, a \u2018technical stepmother\u2019 but not as her mother. Marie doesn\u2019t like this as she sees Cassie as a daughter and has been seeing herself as a mother figure. She has been gently trying to push it with both me and Cassie telling her to stop, especially Cassie. Cassie has explicitly said that Marie is not her mother and she gets frustrated when Marie tries to push it onto her. \n\nI\u2019ve told her as kindly as I could that Cassie doesn\u2019t want a mother and that she needs to accept she will probably never view her as one as Cassie has said it Marie many times. I also validated Marie\u2019s feelings by acknowledging I know it must hurt as she\u2019s in this family now and she doesn\u2019t have kids of her own, but It doesn\u2019t mean Marie is loved any less or minimise her contributions to our household. Marie thinks I\u2019m being slightly heartless because she does things such as taking Cassie places, looking after her etc like I do. She says that she\u2019s a parent as much as I am and that I should talk to Cassie about this, especially since we are now married.\n\nETA: despite the frustrations Marie may be feeling, she has not been bitchy or rude or anything about this. She has been surprisingly calm; even when she talked about feeling like I\u2019m heartless. I think that\u2019s good and on level she probably does get it, but I\u2019m being respectful about this to her and my daughter.\n\nETA 2: some clarification. Cassie knows what a mother is and has never explicitly said she\u2019s felt like she\u2019s missed out on having one. She\u2019s generally a well behaved kid but she\u2019s obviously misbehaved sometimes and had to be punished. I normally am the one to set them, but Marie does have say in disciplining and asking her to do chores and help. It\u2019s not like Marie doesn\u2019t have any say and Cassie gets that and will listen to her. She will actually go to Marie for advice a lot of the time instead of me so Cassie does feel she is a positive female influence. The boundary is that she doesn\u2019t want Marie to force being a mum into her and she doesn\u2019t want her to be her mum. They do spend a lot of time together and do things with and without me there so they are bonded. They have a very good relationship based on love and respect but the only tension is the whole mother angle. Of course Marie helps me with my parenting which I acknowledge and Carrie acknowledges it too, but that does not mean I\u2019m going to force my daughter into accepting her as her mum and I\u2019ve also made Cassie\u2019s boundaries very clear to Marie.\n\nI think considering it\u2019s only been just over 2 years, the fact they have such a strong relationship is amazing. Right now, Cassie feels she doesn\u2019t need a mum and she has even said it might change one day but if Marie continues to push it it will destroy their relationship and push Cassie away. And yes, if something happened to me, I would leave Marie as the legal guardian. Cassie knows this and is fine with it but has pointed out whilst she would be happy to remain with her, she still wouldn\u2019t want to be forced into viewing her as her mother.", "created_utc": 1679261177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vyabb/aita_for_telling_my_wife_as_kindly_as_i_could/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cassie may grow to appreciate Marie as her mother figure but this is the kind of thing that simply can't be forced.", "NTA, you love your kid. You don't wanna force her and it's alright. It probably makes your wife a bit sad, but she should keep in mind that you daughter thinks she is kind of a stepmother, and your daughter still likes your wife.", "NTA. If Marie wants to continue having a good relationship with Cassie, she needs to stop pushing. Continuing to push will kill their relationship. Marie needs to be very clear on this. This app is riddled with stories about how step-parents have ruined relationships with their step-children by pushing the kids to see them as mom or dad. As her father, you have a responsibility to Cassie to protect her.", "It sounds like you've been very clear with Marie about your expectations and Cassie's feelings regarding her role in the family. It's important to respect Cassie's wishes and allow her to form her own relationship with Marie. While Marie may feel hurt or left out, it's important to remember that Cassie's feelings should come first in this situation. It's also important to acknowledge Marie's contributions to the household and her role as a stepmother, even if Cassie doesn't see her as a mother figure.\n\nIt may be helpful to have a family discussion about everyone's roles and expectations, with a focus on Cassie's feelings and needs. It's important for Cassie to feel heard and supported, while also acknowledging Marie's role and contributions. Perhaps you could come up with a compromise or find ways for Marie to build a relationship with Cassie that doesn't involve trying to be a mother figure.\n\nUltimately, it's up to Cassie to decide how she views Marie and her role in her life. As her father, it's important to support her in this and respect her wishes.", "Marie needs to accept that Cassie is at the age where she clearly remembers a time that Marie wasn\u2019t around. Cassie seems to have been okay with no mother then and still is okay with no mother now, and Marie needs to respect her decision. If anything, I would tell your wife she needs to pipe down before Cassie does not like her at all.", "NTA and marie should stop pushing your daughter into a mother-daughter relationship. You say that Cassie loves her and everything but if Marie is pushing it even more than Cassie will resent her for it and Marie and her will not have the same relationship anymore. And you should stand by your daughter on this, what if Marie doesn\u2019t stops? What if that becomes worse when Cassie gets older? What would you do then? You should discuss this with Marie right now, before it's too late", "From your post and the comments I have read it sounds more like Cassie views your wife as more of an aunt or a friend then a parent which is an amazing thing and could be more of what she needs then anything else your wife doesn\u2019t need to be her mother to be important to her I know many people who love there mother so much but rely more on other people in there family to give them what they need", "NTA blended families can be complicated at the start. There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of you setting personal boundaries and your daughter has expressed her right to do that. I understand where your wife is coming from too and why she is hurt. However don\u2019t tell her it\u2019s NEVER gonna happen because your daughter is 10 and who knows maybe one day she will change her mind, or she might not both of those decisions would be okay.

She says that she\u2019s a parent as much as I am and that I should talk to Cassie about this\n\nShe can't force Cassie to call her mom or act like she is her mother. Relationships cannot be forced. And you made this very clear since the beginning. Cassie is old enough to realise that she doesn't want a mother figure because you are all she has had and she may change her mind in the future but she should not be forced. \n\nYour wife trying to force this mother daughter dynamic with Cassie will just push her away, not bring them closer together. \n\nThis is a decision that Cassie needs to make and she has, atleast for now. Your wife needs to back off. Just because she takes Cassie to places and you are now married doesn't mean Cassie owes her a mother daughter bond. If she is solely taking Cassie out so that she will eventually start behaving like her daughter, then that is your wife's ulterior motive, not because she wants to spend time with your daughter.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to understand that is how it is going to be and respect that if she does truly care for her and to stop pushing it.", "NTA.

She came into Cassie\u2019s life later. If Marie let\u2019s go of wanting to be called mom they will probably grow closer.\n\nMy grandfather\u2019s father died young. So through most of his childhood my grandfather had no father. When he was a teen his mother remarried. My grandfather never called his step-father \u201cdad\u201d. He called him by his name. My grandfather admired his step-father tremendously. He would talk about what a good man he was. How my grandfather would go to him for advice. They had a great relationship. My grandfather probably would have called him \u201cdad\u201d if they\u2019d become a family earlier, but fate didn\u2019t work out that way. They still had a great relationship though.", "INFO - You said that Cassie and Marie have a great relationship so what is Marie seeking in her relationship with Cassie that she isn\u2019t getting? Is it just the fact that Cassie doesn\u2019t call her mom or is it other things like being able to discipline or give advice when necessary?", "NTA. \n\nI admire your dedication to becoming a single father by choice and it sounds like you are doing a splendid job of raising your daughter.\n\nI know Marie is eager to step into the role of \"mom\" but the truth is, Cassie has spent the first 10 years of her life as a daughter to a single dad. The marriage is new, even if the relationship isn't. \n\nMy suggestion is not to push it. Let Marie continue to look after her and show her every day that she cares for her. It may take time but eventually Cassie will come to see her as a caregiver at least. \n\nI can't say she will ever see Marie as a mom but someday she may see her as a mom figure. \n\nThese take time. Sometimes a long time. \n\nStay patient and loving. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  What is it with these people who desperately need to be called 'mother' or 'father'?  Why does it need a name like that?  It hasn't been that long - maybe one day your daughter will feel like she is a 'mother' to her, maybe she won't.  But that doesn't mean they can't have a great relationship.  \n\nYour wife is clinging to a word when she should just focus on the person in front of her, and not worry about what she is being called.  Actions are more important here.", "I see both sides:\n\nThis isn't a turn key situation for your wife. Marrying a single dad doesn't automatically make her mom. Your daughter has made clear that your wife isn't going to be \"mom\" and that's her perogative. She isn't obligated to call her by anything other than her name.\n\nOn the other hand, by your own account, you're in denial if you think your wife hasn't taken a parenting role to your daughter. It's not fair to have her running your daughter around and acting as a caregiver, then telling her she has no standing as a (step)parent. Not a \"technical\" step mother, a step mother. That's what she is. Your daughter was still a child (10) when you got together, not in her late teens or twenties. Marie deserves some credit despite the fact that she will never be your daughters mom. A little recognition goes a long way.\n\nIt sounds like you all need to get on the same page and there's some things to be worked out, but NAH.", "NAH You sound like a caring and understanding father and partner. The way you taught your daughter to build her own boundaries and make her own choices is amazing.\n\nIt's okay for your partner to want more of a relationship, but pushing your daughter is not the way to do that. \n\nI would broach the topic in a calm and caring matter that your daughter is entitled to feel how she feels, but that she does love your partner very much. Also, pushing this issue could cause your daughter to tense up and pull back.\n\nYour partner may benefit from a step-parent support group. This could give her insight and allow her to talk to people in similar situations.", "NTA. Marie is only slightly an AH, because she is acting as a mom now. She just doesn't seem to understand that she doesn't get credit for the 10 years beforehand when you were a solo parent", "NTA. You guys have only been together for two years? It\u2019s really hard to go from zero to mom in two years. Unless Cassie had a mom shaped hole in her life, that\u2019s not a very long time. Down the road I expect Cassie will identify Marie as her mom so I wouldn\u2019t say Cassie will *never* accept Marie as a mother \u2014 it just takes time. \n\nMarie needs some therapy or something if she feels the need to force her motherlyness on your daughter. Our kids aren\u2019t here to fill our gaps. Being a parent is a thankless job, being a bonus parent is even more thankless. But as parents we must put aside our needs and wants. Marie doesn\u2019t seem to have learned that yet.", "NTA. It is important to listen to your daughters wishes here. And it might be much better for their relationship if Marie doesn't try to force herself into a role your daughter doesn't need. So they both can be loved and find their way. Maybe if it helps suggest another nickname for Marie or Maries role in Cassies life. Although maybe Cassie is too old for that already and she just likes Marie as your wife.\n\nINFO: did you checked about the legal status of your daughter if  - god forbid - something happens to you? Would Marie be the legal guardian of Cassie or would she go into foster careor to some other relative?", "NAH\n\nI can understand Marie being upset, but Cassie does get a say and it's important that you are helping her advocate for herself.\n\nPerhaps as a way forward you could suggest they come up with a new term that suits them both? It could be an existing word repurposed (e.g. auntie), or a new one altogether. This way they get a special label for their relationship, without Cassie feeling she has to declare Marie as mum, and without Marie feeling she has no special connection to Cassie?", "INFO.  So Cassie is still young in reality, but I don't quite get the practical boundary here.  So now that shes declared her not the mother, does that mean she can't disipline Cassie if she does something wrong?  Can Marie speak up if she notices something Cassie does is wrong?  I feel this is going to cause more of a rift, the reality is you'll be living together and I can see it from Marie's perspective because when you get married, the reality is family unites as well.  How do you raise a teenager without causing a bit of a drift off the bat?", "How old is Marie, maybe she can have a child of her own, or perhaps could adopt one together, it must be hard if she wanted children to be in a family unit but considered the outsider so to speak? You wanted children and managed to have one, surely you can understand her pain here? \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean Cassie is wrong to feel as she does, but also need to not think Marie is there for fun and disposable in other ways too, I do think you had a blinkered view by trying to say this is how works, you expected her to not form an attachment really while also being in the family and now seem surprised she has, it wasn\u2019t unexpected tbh and you need to accept you should have seen it coming, would you be fine being Marie if she had a child and you didn\u2019t\u2026.that she had a surrogate baby that you were expected to act like dad to without not being seen as dad..\ud83d\udc4d\n\nMaybe go talk to someone together and air it all out, if you don\u2019t I think you\u2019ll end up separated as she won\u2019t be happy until it\u2019s talked out with more than an attitude of \u2018well I said in the beginning\u2019 going on \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIf do separate maybe keep women casual and don\u2019t put another in the emotional fallout of being expected to act like a parent but keep the emotions of nobody \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNTA for supporting Cassie but a little bit of one for expecting your now wife to be happy on the sidelines as an optional extra \ud83d\udc4d", "Your daughter has most of her teenage years ahead of her. Those are very formative. There is a very good chance she\u2019ll grow closer to your wife in that time.\n\nYTA for trying to doom the possibility of that before giving it a chance to happen. Basically no time has passed at all. And you have no idea how this will play out\u2026.\n\nI know several people who got step parents at that age, had a love hate relationship with them for the next ten years and then by their mid 20s considered this step parent to be their \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d even though they weren\u2019t biologically related.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then the first question about why there's no mother probably came at around kindergarten, when she saw/realized that there's actually such a thing as a mother (now, where you guided her views, hopefully, in a thought-out manner - and I would be really interested in how you explained the situation, because typically single parents are that not by choice...). Now she's in her early and middle childhood and has taken a very definite stance that there does not need to be a mother in her life - but, keep in mind that that is all she knows in life and 100% does not realize what a mother actually means.  \n\nHonestly, it might take a long time before your daughter realizes that what Marie has become in her life is actually a mother figure. It might even take her growing up and looking back at their relationship from an adult perspective, because as a child she can only relay on her feelings and what you have taught her - i.e. that she does not have a mother and has no need of one. Most likely, her realization about what actually being a mother means will come only if she ever makes a full nuclear family for herself (and at this point hopefully realizes, that Marie actually did the same things with her as she does with her kids). \n\nWhy all this is important? Because currently it's semantics - Marie realizes that what she is becoming is a mother (btw, it was totally predictable that this was going to happen, if all involved adult people are decent humans and actually care about one another - OP, what were you even thinking with \"you will not be a mother\"...), while your daughter does not want to/does not know enough to correlate the name with what is actually happening.\n\nBtw, one last though. Going back to those life stages - the next one is a teenager. And this is where two parents really come in handy, because one parent usually cannot fill the role of provider, confidant, disciplinator (is this the word? :D ) and all others in one person in a healthy way. I hope you realize that now Marie will be the one that helps you with this (since she has a good and growing relationship with your daughter, going by all your comments) and in essence you will be a nuclear family - maybe this is something that you also have to think over for yourself, so you can teach your daughter what a mother means in a healthy way...\n\n**(Wanted to clarify - I don't mean that you need to force your daughter to call Marie her mother... but help her realize what a mother figure can do in your life and then she can make a more informed decision. If she never calls Marie mom, then that's a choice Marie needs to accept and graciously live with as well.)**", "But if she carries in behaving this way then Cassie is going to pull away from her and if you carry on letting it slide (because that\u2019s what you are doing, you need to tell her to Stop) then cassies going to pull away from you too", "Have y'all thought about adopting ...

Nothing wrong with it at all as long as she's not being disrespectful, which based on everything I've read doesn't seem to be the case.\nCassie is allowed to determine who she considers to be her mother, since she doesn't have one.

Why is him standing up and defending his daughter's boundaries dooming the possibility of his wife and child growing closer, when his daughter's boundaries being respected would be the very thing that could help them grow closer?\nBottom line is Cassie has made her feelings perfectly clear.

When someone is being pushy about your boundaries, you are not under any obligation, legally or morally to make compromises on your boundaries to make them happy. That's not how that works. Especially when it is a child who is enforcing those boundaries. Marie needs to be the adult, and get her actions and feelings under control, with help or without it, because she is the adult.

Marie's feelings and wants do not come before Cassie's needs and boundaries. Marie is the adult, she is the one who needs to be the mature one in this situation, recognize and accept her role in Cassie's life that she's been given, or she needs to seriously rethink this relationship.

Marie is the one doing these parenting actions, but that doesn't mean that she automatically gets to be called mother by this girl. That is Cassie's choice. And if Marie didn't want to be a part of that, then she had plenty of time to leave the relationship. In fact, she still can.
