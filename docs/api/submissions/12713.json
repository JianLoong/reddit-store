{"id": 12713, "submission_id": "11vyabb", "title": "AITA for telling my wife as kindly as I could that I think she needs to accept my daughter will probably never view her as a mother?", "selftext": "I\u2019m an older dad. I was born in 1966, so I\u2019m currently 56, turning 57 this year. I really tried to do the classic way of things. You know, settle down, get married, have kids etc. I was actually married when I was young in the 90s and really wanted children but it just never happened. I dated but never really had any luck and the older I got, the more I realised I was running out of time. I was waiting around to meet the perfect woman to be a mother to my kids and in reality, it just didn\u2019t happen. So when I was still in my 40s, I made a decision to become a single dad. I used my life savings and decided to try surrogacy with an egg donor. I thought that if it didn\u2019t work, then at least I tried. I was actually quite pessimistic but I got really lucky. My beautiful little girl Cassie* was born in 2010.\n\nI adore being a dad. She is truly wonderful and even though I was 44 when she was born, I felt lucky that I was able to have a kid. I did worry that not having a mother would affect her, but she has grown up to be just as happy as a kid with two parents. I\u2019ve told her a kid friendly version of why she doesn\u2019t have a mum and she gets it. Obviously now she\u2019s 12, turning 13, I can tell her probably the full truth and I will eventually.\n\nAnyway, I married my wife Marie (50) a few months ago after 2 years of dating. I told her from the start that I\u2019m looking for a partner, not a mother for my kid as Cassie was 10. I explained that if things progressed and got very serious Cassie may very well form an attachment and want a mother figure but that I wouldn\u2019t push it and it\u2019s for Cassie to decide.\n\nCassie has decided that even though she loves Marie and is glad she is part of our family now, she is content in just calling her Marie and says that she will consider her as my wife, a \u2018technical stepmother\u2019 but not as her mother. Marie doesn\u2019t like this as she sees Cassie as a daughter and has been seeing herself as a mother figure. She has been gently trying to push it with both me and Cassie telling her to stop, especially Cassie. Cassie has explicitly said that Marie is not her mother and she gets frustrated when Marie tries to push it onto her. \n\nI\u2019ve told her as kindly as I could that Cassie doesn\u2019t want a mother and that she needs to accept she will probably never view her as one as Cassie has said it Marie many times. I also validated Marie\u2019s feelings by acknowledging I know it must hurt as she\u2019s in this family now and she doesn\u2019t have kids of her own, but It doesn\u2019t mean Marie is loved any less or minimise her contributions to our household. Marie thinks I\u2019m being slightly heartless because she does things such as taking Cassie places, looking after her etc like I do. She says that she\u2019s a parent as much as I am and that I should talk to Cassie about this, especially since we are now married.\n\nETA: despite the frustrations Marie may be feeling, she has not been bitchy or rude or anything about this. She has been surprisingly calm; even when she talked about feeling like I\u2019m heartless. I think that\u2019s good and on level she probably does get it, but I\u2019m being respectful about this to her and my daughter.\n\nETA 2: some clarification. Cassie knows what a mother is and has never explicitly said she\u2019s felt like she\u2019s missed out on having one. She\u2019s generally a well behaved kid but she\u2019s obviously misbehaved sometimes and had to be punished. I normally am the one to set them, but Marie does have say in disciplining and asking her to do chores and help. It\u2019s not like Marie doesn\u2019t have any say and Cassie gets that and will listen to her. She will actually go to Marie for advice a lot of the time instead of me so Cassie does feel she is a positive female influence. The boundary is that she doesn\u2019t want Marie to force being a mum into her and she doesn\u2019t want her to be her mum. They do spend a lot of time together and do things with and without me there so they are bonded. They have a very good relationship based on love and respect but the only tension is the whole mother angle. Of course Marie helps me with my parenting which I acknowledge and Carrie acknowledges it too, but that does not mean I\u2019m going to force my daughter into accepting her as her mum and I\u2019ve also made Cassie\u2019s boundaries very clear to Marie.\n\nI think considering it\u2019s only been just over 2 years, the fact they have such a strong relationship is amazing. Right now, Cassie feels she doesn\u2019t need a mum and she has even said it might change one day but if Marie continues to push it it will destroy their relationship and push Cassie away. And yes, if something happened to me, I would leave Marie as the legal guardian. Cassie knows this and is fine with it but has pointed out whilst she would be happy to remain with her, she still wouldn\u2019t want to be forced into viewing her as her mother.", "created_utc": 1679261177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vyabb/aita_for_telling_my_wife_as_kindly_as_i_could/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cassie may grow to appreciate Marie as her mother figure but this is the kind of thing that simply can't be forced.", "NTA, you love your kid. You don't wanna force her and it's alright. It probably makes your wife a bit sad, but she should keep in mind that you daughter thinks she is kind of a stepmother, and your daughter still likes your wife.", "NTA. If Marie wants to continue having a good relationship with Cassie, she needs to stop pushing. Continuing to push will kill their relationship. Marie needs to be very clear on this. This app is riddled with stories about how step-parents have ruined relationships with their step-children by pushing the kids to see them as mom or dad. As her father, you have a responsibility to Cassie to protect her.", "It sounds like you've been very clear with Marie about your expectations and Cassie's feelings regarding her role in the family. It's important to respect Cassie's wishes and allow her to form her own relationship with Marie. While Marie may feel hurt or left out, it's important to remember that Cassie's feelings should come first in this situation. It's also important to acknowledge Marie's contributions to the household and her role as a stepmother, even if Cassie doesn't see her as a mother figure.\n\nIt may be helpful to have a family discussion about everyone's roles and expectations, with a focus on Cassie's feelings and needs. It's important for Cassie to feel heard and supported, while also acknowledging Marie's role and contributions. Perhaps you could come up with a compromise or find ways for Marie to build a relationship with Cassie that doesn't involve trying to be a mother figure.\n\nUltimately, it's up to Cassie to decide how she views Marie and her role in her life. As her father, it's important to support her in this and respect her wishes.", "Marie needs to accept that Cassie is at the age where she clearly remembers a time that Marie wasn\u2019t around. Cassie seems to have been okay with no mother then and still is okay with no mother now, and Marie needs to respect her decision. If anything, I would tell your wife she needs to pipe down before Cassie does not like her at all.", "NTA and marie should stop pushing your daughter into a mother-daughter relationship. You say that Cassie loves her and everything but if Marie is pushing it even more than Cassie will resent her for it and Marie and her will not have the same relationship anymore. And you should stand by your daughter on this, what if Marie doesn\u2019t stops? What if that becomes worse when Cassie gets older? What would you do then? You should discuss this with Marie right now, before it's too late", "From your post and the comments I have read it sounds more like Cassie views your wife as more of an aunt or a friend then a parent which is an amazing thing and could be more of what she needs then anything else your wife doesn\u2019t need to be her mother to be important to her I know many people who love there mother so much but rely more on other people in there family to give them what they need", "NTA blended families can be complicated at the start. There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of you setting personal boundaries and your daughter has expressed her right to do that. I understand where your wife is coming from too and why she is hurt. However don\u2019t tell her it\u2019s NEVER gonna happen because your daughter is 10 and who knows maybe one day she will change her mind, or she might not both of those decisions would be okay.

She says that she\u2019s a parent as much as I am and that I should talk to Cassie about this\n\nShe can't force Cassie to call her mom or act like she is her mother. Relationships cannot be forced. And you made this very clear since the beginning. Cassie is old enough to realise that she doesn't want a mother figure because you are all she has had and she may change her mind in the future but she should not be forced. \n\nYour wife trying to force this mother daughter dynamic with Cassie will just push her away, not bring them closer together. \n\nThis is a decision that Cassie needs to make and she has, atleast for now. Your wife needs to back off. Just because she takes Cassie to places and you are now married doesn't mean Cassie owes her a mother daughter bond. If she is solely taking Cassie out so that she will eventually start behaving like her daughter, then that is your wife's ulterior motive, not because she wants to spend time with your daughter.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to understand that is how it is going to be and respect that if she does truly care for her and to stop pushing it.", "NTA.

She came into Cassie\u2019s life later. If Marie let\u2019s go of wanting to be called mom they will probably grow closer.\n\nMy grandfather\u2019s father died young. So through most of his childhood my grandfather had no father. When he was a teen his mother remarried. My grandfather never called his step-father \u201cdad\u201d. He called him by his name. My grandfather admired his step-father tremendously. He would talk about what a good man he was. How my grandfather would go to him for advice. They had a great relationship. My grandfather probably would have called him \u201cdad\u201d if they\u2019d become a family earlier, but fate didn\u2019t work out that way. They still had a great relationship though.", "INFO - You said that Cassie and Marie have a great relationship so what is Marie seeking in her relationship with Cassie that she isn\u2019t getting? Is it just the fact that Cassie doesn\u2019t call her mom or is it other things like being able to discipline or give advice when necessary?", "NTA. \n\nI admire your dedication to becoming a single father by choice and it sounds like you are doing a splendid job of raising your daughter.\n\nI know Marie is eager to step into the role of \"mom\" but the truth is, Cassie has spent the first 10 years of her life as a daughter to a single dad. The marriage is new, even if the relationship isn't. \n\nMy suggestion is not to push it. Let Marie continue to look after her and show her every day that she cares for her. It may take time but eventually Cassie will come to see her as a caregiver at least. \n\nI can't say she will ever see Marie as a mom but someday she may see her as a mom figure. \n\nThese take time. Sometimes a long time. \n\nStay patient and loving. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  What is it with these people who desperately need to be called 'mother' or 'father'?  Why does it need a name like that?  It hasn't been that long - maybe one day your daughter will feel like she is a 'mother' to her, maybe she won't.  But that doesn't mean they can't have a great relationship.  \n\nYour wife is clinging to a word when she should just focus on the person in front of her, and not worry about what she is being called.  Actions are more important here.", "I see both sides:\n\nThis isn't a turn key situation for your wife. Marrying a single dad doesn't automatically make her mom. Your daughter has made clear that your wife isn't going to be \"mom\" and that's her perogative. She isn't obligated to call her by anything other than her name.\n\nOn the other hand, by your own account, you're in denial if you think your wife hasn't taken a parenting role to your daughter. It's not fair to have her running your daughter around and acting as a caregiver, then telling her she has no standing as a (step)parent. Not a \"technical\" step mother, a step mother. That's what she is. Your daughter was still a child (10) when you got together, not in her late teens or twenties. Marie deserves some credit despite the fact that she will never be your daughters mom. A little recognition goes a long way.\n\nIt sounds like you all need to get on the same page and there's some things to be worked out, but NAH.", "NAH You sound like a caring and understanding father and partner. The way you taught your daughter to build her own boundaries and make her own choices is amazing.\n\nIt's okay for your partner to want more of a relationship, but pushing your daughter is not the way to do that. \n\nI would broach the topic in a calm and caring matter that your daughter is entitled to feel how she feels, but that she does love your partner very much. Also, pushing this issue could cause your daughter to tense up and pull back.\n\nYour partner may benefit from a step-parent support group. This could give her insight and allow her to talk to people in similar situations.", "NTA. Marie is only slightly an AH, because she is acting as a mom now. She just doesn't seem to understand that she doesn't get credit for the 10 years beforehand when you were a solo parent", "NTA. You guys have only been together for two years? It\u2019s really hard to go from zero to mom in two years. Unless Cassie had a mom shaped hole in her life, that\u2019s not a very long time. Down the road I expect Cassie will identify Marie as her mom so I wouldn\u2019t say Cassie will *never* accept Marie as a mother \u2014 it just takes time. \n\nMarie needs some therapy or something if she feels the need to force her motherlyness on your daughter. Our kids aren\u2019t here to fill our gaps. Being a parent is a thankless job, being a bonus parent is even more thankless. But as parents we must put aside our needs and wants. Marie doesn\u2019t seem to have learned that yet.", "NTA. It is important to listen to your daughters wishes here. And it might be much better for their relationship if Marie doesn't try to force herself into a role your daughter doesn't need. So they both can be loved and find their way. Maybe if it helps suggest another nickname for Marie or Maries role in Cassies life. Although maybe Cassie is too old for that already and she just likes Marie as your wife.\n\nINFO: did you checked about the legal status of your daughter if  - god forbid - something happens to you? Would Marie be the legal guardian of Cassie or would she go into foster careor to some other relative?", "NAH\n\nI can understand Marie being upset, but Cassie does get a say and it's important that you are helping her advocate for herself.\n\nPerhaps as a way forward you could suggest they come up with a new term that suits them both? It could be an existing word repurposed (e.g. auntie), or a new one altogether. This way they get a special label for their relationship, without Cassie feeling she has to declare Marie as mum, and without Marie feeling she has no special connection to Cassie?", "INFO.  So Cassie is still young in reality, but I don't quite get the practical boundary here.  So now that shes declared her not the mother, does that mean she can't disipline Cassie if she does something wrong?  Can Marie speak up if she notices something Cassie does is wrong?  I feel this is going to cause more of a rift, the reality is you'll be living together and I can see it from Marie's perspective because when you get married, the reality is family unites as well.  How do you raise a teenager without causing a bit of a drift off the bat?", "How old is Marie, maybe she can have a child of her own, or perhaps could adopt one together, it must be hard if she wanted children to be in a family unit but considered the outsider so to speak? You wanted children and managed to have one, surely you can understand her pain here? \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean Cassie is wrong to feel as she does, but also need to not think Marie is there for fun and disposable in other ways too, I do think you had a blinkered view by trying to say this is how works, you expected her to not form an attachment really while also being in the family and now seem surprised she has, it wasn\u2019t unexpected tbh and you need to accept you should have seen it coming, would you be fine being Marie if she had a child and you didn\u2019t\u2026.that she had a surrogate baby that you were expected to act like dad to without not being seen as dad..\ud83d\udc4d\n\nMaybe go talk to someone together and air it all out, if you don\u2019t I think you\u2019ll end up separated as she won\u2019t be happy until it\u2019s talked out with more than an attitude of \u2018well I said in the beginning\u2019 going on \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIf do separate maybe keep women casual and don\u2019t put another in the emotional fallout of being expected to act like a parent but keep the emotions of nobody \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNTA for supporting Cassie but a little bit of one for expecting your now wife to be happy on the sidelines as an optional extra \ud83d\udc4d", "Your daughter has most of her teenage years ahead of her. Those are very formative. There is a very good chance she\u2019ll grow closer to your wife in that time.\n\nYTA for trying to doom the possibility of that before giving it a chance to happen. Basically no time has passed at all. And you have no idea how this will play out\u2026.\n\nI know several people who got step parents at that age, had a love hate relationship with them for the next ten years and then by their mid 20s considered this step parent to be their \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d even though they weren\u2019t biologically related.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it seems interesting to explore either way!", "I said it. She\u2019s 50. I\u2019m 56.", "I\u2019m not dooming anything. Im just reinforcing my daughters boundaries whilst at the same time, trying not to force a mother label. Cassie might never change her mind or she might in the next week. At the end of the day, I\u2019m not going to tell my daughter she has to accept Marie as a mother and I\u2019m not going to tell Marie that Cassie will accept her. I\u2019m just doing what is best for my daughter.", "That sounds like a great relationship. Marie needs to learn to accept that because she will lose it if she pushes for more.", "[deleted]", "Sounds like your wife should consider herself your daughter's mom without the title. Mutual love and respect is what matters, not titles.", "[deleted]", "It's great to hear that Cassie and Marie have a good bond and spend time together. It's important to continue to reinforce Cassie's boundaries and allow her to make her own decisions about her relationship with Marie. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with Marie about your and Cassie's feelings and expectations.\n\nAs you said, if Cassie grows to view Marie as a mother figure, that would be wonderful. But it's important to let that happen naturally and not push it in a way that could potentially harm your daughter or your relationship with her. It sounds like you are handling the situation in a thoughtful and respectful way. Keep up the good work!", "I mean I can understand why she feels that way as well, but you as Cassie\u2019s parent needs to ensure that her boundaries are not crossed \u2014 whether it\u2019s by your wife or not.", "I think your daughter and wife have a beautiful relationship and maybe sitting them down together and letting your daughter express that even tho she doesn\u2019t feel she needs a mother or see her as one doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t one of the most important people in her life it\u2019s just not what she needs she needs her to be exactly as she is just simply her amazing Marie", "NAH. It sounds like Cassie has accepted Marie as a mother figure, she just hasn\u2019t given her the title. Marie might think that without the title she hasn\u2019t been fully accepted by Cassie but that isn\u2019t true. Have you considered talking with a family therapist about this? Marie needs to come to terms with her role in Cassie\u2019s life without alienating her in the process. A therapist could help with that.", "you are a great dad op", "Marie isn\u2019t even being bitchy or mean about it, so I think that\u2019s a good sign despite how frustrated or sad she may feel.", "She has told me that in words to that effect.", "His daughter is obviously being raised with love so it can very well be true she doesn't miss having a mom. Nobody would bat an eye at a single mom raising a boy.", "Maybe show her this post and some of the comments it might give her some perspective as someone who has a step mother I wish mine was like her just simply there for me when I need her someone who cared for me I didn\u2019t need her to be my mother I just need her to be my friend and know that she loved me that\u2019s all I needed from her", "I never really considered therapy but it might be a good idea.", "NTA, you can not force someone to feel a certain way about another person.", "What does Cassie and Marie think a mother is to a 12 year old girl? It\u2019s pretty close to what you\u2019re describing, except often they at least temporarily hate each other, and also call you by your first name.\ud83e\udd23", "Even if Cassie really does love her and is denying her this to be a brat, that\u2019s pretty normal with how 12 year olds treat their mothers. It\u2019s all about beginning to exert their separation, welcome to the teenaged years. And they\u2019re always nicer to their Dads.", "OP=NTA\n\nMaybe you can search AITA and show Marie the downside of PUSHING a parental role on a kid.  Here on Reddit IT never has a happy ending.\n\nMarie knew from the beginning that she wasn't going to be slid into the Mother role.  Maybe she should consult a therapist who could give her coping mechanisms to deal with her own motherhood issues.", "If it makes you feel better about the old parent thing, my dad was 51 and mom was 46 when they had me. I was raised with just my dad but everyone thinks he is my grandpa.. lol", "NTA Marie should talk to someone about this, but that someone is a therapist, not Cassie. Nobody could force Cassie to change the way she views Marie, anyway. That's not how feelings work. Honestly, the fact that Marie is being so pushy about this is probably what's hurting her the most.", "Dude, you are too old to have married someone that doesn't listen and doesn't understand when you told her that you weren't looking for a mom for your kid. \n\nThat said, your wife is a coparent at this point, did you think this through? Your wife is doing every single mom duty. Were you so eager to share responsibility that you kind of fed into this? Your wife needs to back off but I'm not sure how easy it will be to do that at this point. ESH because I think you both overstepped.", "NTA. The problem is Marie is obsessed with the title \u201cmother\u201d but not seeing she is on the road to that with the relationship she\u2019s building. Cassie is a kid with complicated feelings to sort out. I recently heard someone point out, an adult knows who they are and has their personality firmly established. A kid changes day by day and who Cassie is now is not who she will be in 5 years. Marie\u2019s expectations are unrealistic and will ruin what she\u2019s actually building.", "NAH - at your own description, your wife has stepped in as a caretaker of your daughter. And that means something. Obviously they have a bonded relationship. But what your wife might need is clearer boundary lines to help her make sense of the situation which isn\u2019t unfair to her given the dynamic she shares with Cassie. You are right to not want to force your daughter into considering Marie her mother, but you owe Marie some clarity about how she is expected to be a stepmother to a 13 year old who she\u2019ll expectedly be \u201cparenting\u201d all through middle and high school. I would help Marie see how she is still loved and valued and a member of the family even if she isn\u2019t \u201cMom\u201d. I would also have a conversation with Cassie so you understand what are those things Cassie considers too \u201cmom\u201d like? Is it disciplining? If you\u2019re not clear about it as the one to set the boundary, your wife and daughters relationship will fracture because of the lack of clarity.", "I totally agree with you.", "This!  I was ten when my mom remarried and my stepdad adopted me.  My stepdad was the greatest guy in the world and I loved him wholeheartedly. I never called him Dad.  He knew what he was to me and never needed me to use the title.  He was willing to take whatever relationship I could give him at the beginning, and as a result, it grew and built naturally until he was the first one I told about everything.", "NTA, if your wife doesn't get onboard with your daughter being the one to decide this then you need to reevaluate your marriage.", "NTA \n\nWhy do people think forcing a relationship on a child will have any happy outcome? It just causes resentment, hostility, and anger. The opposite happens; the child will have even less positive feelings toward the person and will never entertain the thought of having ANY type of contact with the individual once they are 18.", "Cassie has possibly identified herself as whole without a mother figure. To have a trusted loving female figure in her life is a positive addition while she maintains her identity. She doesn\u2019t need to unravel who she is to include Marie in her life.", "NTA\n\nMost important thing is you have to get Marie to understand she HAS to back off. Every time she brings it up it's like grit in Cassie's eye, snaps the desire not to right back to the front of her brain and tanks any progress. Listen to Cassie on that point, it'll never happen if Marie doesn't stop trying to force it.", "I think think this might be a situation where your wife may need some therapy. Could she not have children of her own? Could it be a situation where she made her peace with not having kids until it almost felt like she had one, and she got kinda carried away with it? \n\nI don\u2019t want to put any kind of feelings or words into your wife\u2019s mouth but that context was left out of the story and could be important as to why this issue keeps repeating. Wish you all the best as this seems like a situation that can be solved with some good communication!", "You just need to be on the lookout. This can easily turn into hounding and/or a growing resentment on both their ends because neither is getting what they want. Marie wanting a child and being called mom and Cassie with someone in more of an auntie role. \n\nAt the end of the day Cassie feeling safe and comfortable in her home is more important than your wife getting to be a mom. If it comes to that you have to be ready to make that decision.", "Try to find a balance with Cassie bc Marie is being a mom filling that role so while I wouldn\u2019t push a mom title but maybe Cassie can recognize the importance of Marie in other ways", "This is the relationship I have with my stepsons.  There\u2019s a lot of love on all sides.  We\u2019ve always said they have their mom, their dad, and their CPSue.  In your case, Cassie has her dad and her Marie.  Marie\u2019s role is to be another adult who loves Cassie.  \u201cMother\u201d is just a word.  Marie needs to gauge the relationship by Cassie\u2019s actions, not her words.  It sounds like a mother-daughter relationship to me, but without the use of the word, \u201cMother.\u201d  NTA"]}
