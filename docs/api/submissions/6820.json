The mother no doubt is going to cause issues because she won't really view it as an adoption.\n\nThe child is an infant - infants are generally adopted very quickly if there are no impediments to adoption - i.e. if both parents give up parental rights so the child is available. Infants and toddlers generally linger in the foster care system when their parents aren't willing to give up parental rights.\n\nBest solution is for the child to be given up for adoption because a new family would love the child because they actively wanted a child and it wouldn't carry all of the baggage that it would if you reluctantly adopted the child of your half sister who was a result of your father's affair.", "NTA\n\n> My mother called me a few days ago and said I\u2019m being selfish and cruel for potentially letting the child be taken by the state.\n\nThen she should take him.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

There are ways to rally as a family without taking over the responsibility of parenting. \n\nIf nobody is willing to help and the child is being mistreated or neglected, she needs to make the choice to adopt him out to a family that wants him.

Your excuse is valid too. Your sister cannot simply pass her obligations and consequences over to you to take in against your will.
