Pay for me to go to BoraBora and I will watch your children.", "NTA.\n\nYour request was more than reasonable. Your son's GF clearly has more common sense than your son.", "NTA. Except its not babysitting; its spending time with his brothers. Seriously, what part of family vacation went over his head?\n\nDanielle clearly heard the family part.", "NTA. You laid your conditions and I think they're fair. He gets to bring his girlfriend, have a seperate room while you share, both of them are having a free vacation and in return, they'll babysit sometimes. It's actually too good and his girlfriend probably sees it that way too since she's agreed. If he doesn't want it, his loss. He can tell his girlfriend she can't come.", "NTA - He gets to go on a free vacation to Bora Bora for two whole weeks AND you\u2019re paying for his gf? Yeah, your son is acting entitled, and you are not in any way wrong for asking him to repay your generosity with a little babysitting.", "Sounds like it\u2019ll just be the 4 of you then.\n\nNTA!\n\nEdit: And I mean you, 7 & 9 yo and DANIELLE!", "I will go for half time babysitting, detached room.", "nta, that said, you have to say how many nights are they gonna babysit, how many nights are gonna be group/family activity, and how many nights are gonna be \"date\" time for you son and girlfriend. clearity is good", "NTA at all.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you plan on spending time with your 7 & 10 yo, but also want some of your own downtime in paradise.  This is a very reasonable request!  \n\n\nI'd be happy to take their place and babysit whenever needed, lol!", "NTA.  Your son is entitled.  Lay out the expectations on the amount of time you are expecting babysitting.", "NTA - You're footing the bill?  You have a right to ask for some help.  It doesn't sound like you're expecting them to nanny every minute of the day, so asking for some help so you can do some adult things is not at all unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nYou're paying, you make the rules.", "Definitely NTA. Bora Bora is an unbelievable place, and your son should be grateful he gets to go. And babysitting? That\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking him to scrub toilets. \n\nBut you\u2019ll love the place. Enjoy your trip.", "NTA your son should understand if he wants to bring a guest he should make some compromises. You are not asking or expecting them to babysit the entire time. You are being reasonable he is not.", "NTA\n\nIt's a fair trade. I'd ask an older sibling to watch younger ones just because that's how families work.  Obviously not all the time, but like an evening or two out a couple of hours here and there? Being tea siren on vacation is a privilege and it comes with a cost.", "NTA...?\n\nKinda depends on what you mean by \"some babysitting\". The teenagers have to watch the kids at the pool while you rest for an afternoon? Easy. Watching them for a few days while you go out on a bender? Not cool. Make the demands of the trip *clear* from the get-go and they can decide if they want to go or not. Then stick to it!", "NTA- his gf gets a free trip and he is acting like an entitled brat? Long as you aren't expecting him to watch them the whole time there which doesnt seem the case.", "NTA. Fair trade.", "I\u2019ll baby sit, can I go? \n\nNTA", "NTA.

It\u2019s spending time with family and loved ones. Try not to label it as a \u201cduty\u201d.
