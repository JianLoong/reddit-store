Like in the absence of any clearly defined schedule, he might be assuming some worst-case scenario where he, gf, and the kids are attached at the hip literally 24/7 without even a single moment of peace, much less a date night or whatever.  Which, yeah, I\u2019d be pissed about too if that were actually true (which it\u2019s not, right?), as being a 24/7 nanny is anything *but* a vacation, and not worth it to go even if \u201cfree.\u201d\n\nSo yeah, ESH as it stands.  But you can turn that around!  \n\nStart by drafting a reasonable schedule.  Like literally write down babysitting dates and time windows.

As in, don\u2019t be a hard ass about a Wednesday night verses a Thursday night if it doesn\u2019t much matter to you, but means a lot to them (like the difference would allow them to do a special tour or dinner or something, for example).

And only for like a few hours max lol.", "That\u2019s what I need for my kids \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nCome over and play pub g, Roblox, COD with them just make sure they don\u2019t burn the house down lmao", "Yep and tell her she can bring a friend.  18 y/o son is lucky if it\u2019s him.", ">Watching and spending time with your siblings to give you parent a break and basically say \u201cthanks\n\nthat IS babysitting.  You are babysitting as a thank you.  You are babysitting as part of the deal.  OP has every right to require that in exchange for the trip. But in the words of Judge Judy... \"dont pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\"\n\nIf OP's son can't just get up and go to the bar because he HAS to supervise his siblings, then he's babysitting. \n\nIf my boss says I HAVE to come into the office on Saturday, then I'm working overtime.  I'm not just \"spending quality time with my boss.\" lol.", "Footing the bill doesn't mean that she shouldn't be paying for her son if he doesn't do anything - it just means that she's paying for his trip. She's footing the bill for the younger children, as well.", "They aren't adults yet.", "Being kids, do you want them to work as mechanics to pay for the trip?", "Seems older brother did that first. Family helps each other out. I used to watch my younger cousins for a few evenings so the adults could go out, in response to bringing my friend. Easy. I would have done it anyway.", "I guess I just personally take people saying he got a free trip as \u201cson is getting a free trip [for his gf]\u201d, so I might just be reading into comments from a slightly different slant. \n\nFrankly, an 18 year old should be aware enough to understand the cost associated with his gf coming and realize that asking for her to come was a big ask to make in the first place. So if OP wants to tag a condition on it after to clarify that this is not exactly a \u201cfreebie\u201d, he still has a little nerve getting titchy about it. Reacting that way reflects entitlement on his part. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s married and asking to bring his wife, who actually would be part of the family. If Danielle isn\u2019t bothered in the least by the request, he shouldn\u2019t be, either. Expecting his parent to foot the bill for Danielle to come and also expecting to give up nothing or offer nothing back to them in return is a spoiled mindset I\u2019d expect from the 10yo. It doesn\u2019t make OP an AH.", "When you\u2019re 18 and can\u2019t pay for shit, any vacation is a vacation. Some of you guys need to get off the computer and interact with real people. You\u2019re not always the victim man. The sooner you accept that the better your life will be", "Oo ok. Turn 18 and no longer part of family.", "So the 18 year old no longer gets the benifits of being in the family? If 18 year old is expected to babysit to pay for his portion and his girlfriends portion of the trip then 7 and 10 year old can do chores to \"pay\" for there portion of the trip.", "It\u2019s not even babysitting.. does the brother think he\u2019s just getting a free vacation for him and his girlfriend? That they\u2019ll just get to run off on their own? Shouldn\u2019t he be just as excited to spend some time with his siblings and family? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get multiple nights where him and GF can go do their own thing.", "Danielle should be expected to babysit and the terms should be laid out before any tickets are purchased this way she can decide if she accepts or not.", "Bro he\u2019s still in high school and probably just turned 18. Just because someone\u2019s a legal adult doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re mentally a legal adult yet. At closer to 19 or 20 I can understand, but not all 18 year olds shift right into adult mode.\nSouth Korea has the right idea in bumping the age of adulthood to 20.", "I don't expect literal kids to do stuff to pay for a trip, however as someone who also went to trips at 18 for free I also did chores and took care of my little brother because I understand that my parents also wanted some time alone. Is the bare minimum to help out when you:\n\nAre going FOR FREE for TWO WEEKS to Bora Bora. I would be grateful enough to not say anything, he will barely \"babysit\", seems ungrateful enough that he's going for free with his gf and doesn't wanna do anything to help out.", "Benefits come with responsibilities. This isn\u2019t a new concept.", "Lol are you serious? An 18YO should naturally have more responsibility than a 7YO. Reddit is insane.", "Apparently!", "Bro\u2026he\u2019s going to bora bora for 2 weeks. That\u2019s like $20k at least all in for 2 people. So closer to $30k-$40k for the family? Get outta here with the constant victim shit and woe is me tiktok talking points. Don\u2019t want to babysit? Stay home. You\u2019re not entitled to anything and less than 5% of the human population will ever go to bora bora because THEY CANT AFFORD IT", "Ok keep your head up your ass for all I care", "I wonder if the 18yo says no. What's the op gonna do? Kick him off the trip? Force him to come because he wants a babysitter?"]}
