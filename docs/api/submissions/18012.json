OP described wanting \"me time\" without the kids. So that sounds like OP will be gone and DS will be in loco parentis.  The kids are not DS's responsibility in general. He's not their parent. If he's watching them, that's babysitting. I do think DS should expect that he will be spending a lot of time with family on the trip. That is different from the parent leaving him in charge of the kids.\n\nDefinitions aside, I think it's a reasonable exchange. I am wondering if DS being peeved is related to how and when it was put. I got the impression that the babysitting requirement came sometime later after the initial plans. If DS asked if his GF could come, OP said yes, then some days later said \"And I'm expecting you to do a few days of babysitting so I can get some Me time while were there.\" then I could see him being a bit upset because the condition wasn't put to him up front, and he had already asked his GF without the condition.\n\nIf it wasn't said up front, that's not ideal.

This is something I only felt after going to college and living away from them. Something my 2nd brother is understanding now after going to college( we are 3 brothers).\n\nSo OPs son is missing out on an experience that won't come again in the future as his siblings become older and more mature. \n\nBabysitting for me is something done by an outsider, not a family member. Yes, it should be paid if it's a regular occurrence or limits opportunities above a certain point for the said family member.\n\nBut the fact is my parents never made me watch them,even now, more than a few hours a day, and the total days won't even cross a week in a year.

Then I can't go because i have to babysit lol.  The context of not having an option to do something else makes it babysitting.  Which is fine. But that's just what it is."]}
