Fianc\u00e9 is threatening me.", "selftext": "Hey everyone, my fianc\u00e9 (M42) and I (F35) have been together 5+ years. For some context, I am a small business owner and I was able to buy the house we currently live in. My fianc\u00e9 did not put any money down in that process. I also have paid for fixes. Small and large. Electrical, major plumbing, ect.\n\nOur basement flooded a few months ago and after my homeowners insurance claim came through, I started using it to pay myself back + fix the basement. I ended up hiring a concrete contractor to encapsulate our asbestos tile in the basement. He did a terrible job. BUT it is covered. So despite it looking ugly and not using enough material, the asbestos is encapsulated. I paid 2k for that. \n\nLil not so fun fact:\nMy fianc\u00e9 pays half the mortgage but ANYTIME there is a fight he threatens to take his payment away. Says things like \u201cYOUR house\u201d or \u201cYOUR lawn\u201d Or talks to me like I\u2019m his shitty landlord. \n\nThis brings me to yesterday.\n\nUp until yesterday the plan was to stain and seal the basement floor and move on. Well, I get a text around noon yesterday and it\u2019s my fianc\u00e9 going on about sinking more money into the basement floor. \n\nHe now wants me to spend another 3.2k on more concrete/water proofing. I told him no and that we can just seal it and throw some rugs down to save money. \n\nHe has been flipping out on me since. Calling me a gollum with my money. Saying I don\u2019t care about him, threatening to not pay his half of the mortgage. Sending me text after text and then getting home and yelling at me. I told him I don\u2019t feel well as I\u2019m taking meds for some skin issue right now and he wouldn\u2019t let up. He also told me how he phoned his friends throughout the day to tell them the situation and how they think I am disregarding his feelings. He said he refuses to go down there until it\u2019s done, and if I don\u2019t give him $ he is going to pay for it but then refuse to pay half the mortgage. So at this point I have to just give him the money to make him happy and avoid issues.\n\nI slept on the couch last night because I didn\u2019t want to be near him. Not because I\u2019m afraid, more so because he is giving me major ick and I really don\u2019t like him right now.\n\nI really truly don\u2019t understand why we should put a total of over 5k into a concrete floor. Like dude\u2026.it\u2019s a floor. If I want to spend another 3k I\u2019ll treat the current concrete as a sub floor and then lay something better on top. I\u2019m starting to think my partner is a giant man baby. \n\nSo AITA and should I put out more money to \u201cfinish\u201d the basement the way my fianc\u00e9 wants?", "created_utc": 1693911947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16al74h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_my_insurance_money/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So he's still being a A-hole  and going about it in the wrong way but he might have a point since the floor seems to have been done poorly and you are walking on it.   Maybe just a get a inspector for a second opinion and move from there? He wants reassurances and since neither of your work with asbestos you can't provide it. He should still contribute to the cost though.  Either way it would probably still improve the value of the house, so the money wouldn't be completely gone   \n\n\nJust a suggestion."]}
