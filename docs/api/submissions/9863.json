Tanya said she is not sure, but she suspects they started seeing each other when she was between 10 and 12 years old. Tanya's parents divorced when she was 16 years old, so I was confused.

I don\u2019t think that word is used lightly in this situation, and Tanya has cut off contact with him, which indicates egregious behavior. \n\nAnd finally, someone can be both a victim of abuse AND a cheater at the same time. Both cheating and abuse are bad; but I know which is worse. Sure hope you do too.", "When someone is abused over a long period of time, they find it hard to see a way out.

It doesn\u2019t mean that there wasn\u2019t an affair to be had, it just means she herself isn\u2019t sure when explicitly they began their affair since she obviously didn\u2019t see them in the act but only from account of her mother.\n\nDivorces can take years but the mother can also physically be away so not sure how this is relevant. \n\nA husband who yells at his wife, is emotionally unavailable, is just plain rude at every turn and doesn\u2019t do a single household task or chore or anything to help his wife or children is horrible as well. That\u2019s horrible but it\u2019s not a physically unsafe environment. Even if he hits her, there\u2019s a difference between getting slapped and getting beaten black and blue. If it was the latter, I genuinely doubt she\u2019d be beginning a new relationship any time soon. \n\nAnd just because abuse is bad, doesn\u2019t defend cheating. Both are bad. Just become something is more wrong than the other, doesn\u2019t justify that."]}
