Then you cleaned up. She can be upset and sad, but she's the one who did this, not you. Phobias and OCD are frustrating for the person who has them, but that doesn't mean you have to bend to every whim or read her mind.", "NTA and she needs therapy", "NTA She told you she couldn't eat them. That is the information you had at the time you threw them away. There is no way you could have known she would change her mind. In future you now know it is wise to ask before tossing the food away. You did nothing wrong here.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t an advice sub, so I\u2019ll just say seek out some qualified medical advice for yourself and your partner concerning OCD and eating disorders. They are EXTREMELY resistant to treatment. Good luck.", "NAH\n\nI think this is just one of those stupid things that happen from time to time.\n\nIt's a misunderstanding. \n\nYou did what you would normally do. Your partner's upset because she was probably very hungry. She probably had to fight her own brain to convince it the nuggets were still safe to eat.\n\nIf she's not seeking therapy, she should be. Since your money's tight, she could probably look into local social services. Many places offer free, low-cost, or sliding-scale mental health care. Germophobia, and fear of contamination, can cause a lot of self-harm just from people trying to stay clean. It's a problem that easily spirals out of control.", "NTA. However i think since this is so out of character for her, maybe the issue doesn\u2019t really lie in the food. My guess is that she was upset with smt else and projected her feeling onto this.", "NTA\n\nHer prior behaviour and her reaction led you to believe she wouldn't eat them.\n\nShe saw you take them, if she wanted them, she should have reclaimed them or told you not to throw them away.\n\nHowever if you thought they were clean, you should have kept them for later if you're low on food.", "NTA. She said she wouldn't eat them. \n\n>won't hug me if I've been outside.\n\nRun away!", "NTA You made her food and then cleaned up after she said she wouldn\u2019t eat them. \n\nTell her the garbage isn\u2019t that dirty and she can grab them out of there. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23", "NAH\n\nYou didn't 'take' her food from her, also she's not an AH for changing her mind.

It sounds pretty extreme.  \n\nShe told you she wouldn't eat them and insisted on it, in fact.  Then after you scrape them in the trash, she changes her mind?  And gets mad at you?  For doing what she asked you to?\n\nThis is all on her.  Please insist she get professional help for her germaphobia.  She may even need medication, but that's up to the experts to determine.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nShe put a hissy fit on- the food is gone, she cannot go back on it. I have to ask though - why didn't you eat it (or froze it for yourself later on) if you both are tight on food.\n\nAlso, you have to reconsider this relationship.", "NTA", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thus...trash.", "**NAH**\n\nShe's allowed to be upset that food she turned out to want ended up in the garbage when y'all are struggling for money and there isn't much to eat available. She's not an AH for wishing you hadn't thrown it out.\n\nBut you're also not an AH for throwing the nuggets out given that her behaviour diverged significantly from the usual, and that you had every reason to expect that she wasn't going to want to touch them again. \n\nThere are NAH, just an unfortunate misunderstanding.", "This is why people should eat at a table, like a normal human being.", "> I suggest you perhaps ask, in these situations, \"what would you like me to do next time?\" because a productive conversation where you validate and reassure her of the future goes a long way.\n\nThis is a great approach, most definitely. \n\nCommunication is always a mess when someone's upset with themselves and regretting a choice they made.

She doesn't have OCD, but as she trained to be a chef, she gets very picky about food hygiene habits, and her BPD often causes ill measured reactions", "Yeah. NAH.

Not doing this, probably makes your financial situation worse.", "Fair enough, she was pissed.\n\nI still think my comment applies.", "You can refreeze thawed meat as long as it was thawed in the refrigerator.  The issue is not pathogens in that case, but every time raw meat is frozen and thawed(and you have no real way of knowing how many times that has happened during shipping or selling) it degrades the muscle fibers and makes it less appetizing to eat.", "Thank you for the info! I just wasnt sure if cooking items from frozen then refreezing would be okay, as many items say not to! I know with normal leftovers, but this was a gap in my knowledge", "When I cook anything from scratch that is what I do, and this is the first time throwing good food away. The financial situation is unfortunately out of our control, but I promise we do make good choices usually", "Generally I agree with you.  Provided the fridge is maintained at the correct temp and the time thawed is reasonably short,, it should be just fine safety wise.  As you said, it does degrade the quality.", "If people are struggling to food on the table- I don't think that matters.", "Yes that speaks to my original point..."]}
