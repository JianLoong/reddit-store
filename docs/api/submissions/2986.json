We have an international vacation date quickly approaching so a lot to get get done.\n\nYesterday I noticed a huge rip in the butt of my jeans and while my gf was heading out last night to Target for errands, I asked gf if she could pick me up jeans since I was working late. She said, *\"No problem\"* and I gave her my size.\n\nShe then paused before leaving to asked if I wanted those in **slim-fit**. I told her, *\"No thanks. Slim-fit is too tight around my thighs and butt.\"* She said, *\"Slim-fit is just a style, not a fit.\"* I responded, *\"I don't think so. I've had them before and they don't fit me at the weight Im at right now.\"* She argued, *\"Slim-fit just tapers off and gets narrow down the pants.\"* I retorted, *\"Exactly, it gets narrow, which changes the size, which changes the fit. Just get me regular jeans please.\"* We went back and forth a little longer and she finally shrugged, *\"Okay\"* and left.\n\nI am *very* insecure about the weight Im at right now and communicate that. So when gf got home bringing not just a pair of slim-fit, but skinny-fit as well, I was very upset.\n\nI said, *\"thank you very much\"*, gave her a hug, and went back to work. *\"Well aren't you going to try them on?\"*, she asked. I told her not right now. Truthfully I didn't want her to see me pathetically attempt to wear them. And for some reason she just persisted. Maybe to prove me wrong? I caved and sure enough, in front of her, struggled like a fat loser to get the jeans around my thighs and butt. I forced them up - the waist size was no problem, exactly as I asked - but the jeans were uncomfortably tight around my thighs and rear. And it was obvious to the point that now she had nothing to say other than, \"Well it's all Target had.\"\n\nFor the rest of the night, expressed in my attitude and voice was just genuine ungratefulness and I told her how I felt, and showed her Google results of what slim-fit meant. Not only did she specifically get me something I asked her not to, and bug me to put these unflattering jeans on, now I have to waste my time returning them. But now she's upset over my attitude because she claims, \"I was just trying to do you a favor.\" AITA for being upset at her?", "created_utc": 1669134850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1y2hx/aita_for_being_ungrateful_that_my_gf_got_me_what/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most men of your age wear regular jeans because you\u2019re an adult man. A recently single guy might (wrongly) wear tight jeans because they think it looks better and they want to meet someone. Guys that wear jeans that are really baggy seem immature. There was an article in a fashion magazine years ago only it was about which guy in which type of bathing suit is the best. They chose regular ones. Not too tight or too baggy. \nMost people as an adult only fit into one type of jeans that look good. A year ago I was looking for some sweat pants for my stepfather to wear in the hospital. At that time all of them had a very narrow legs. His feet were not only swollen but he was wearing some type of foot brace. None of the pants I saw would go over that, so I got him nothing. He was to have died soon so I just wanted him to be comfortable. But if he wasn\u2019t in the hospital he still would not have liked that. It definitely wasn\u2019t his personality. \n\nI do think some girlfriends and wives they to get their SO to look better. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with looking your best but it has to suit them and be comfortable. \n\nWhen I was married my husband would go everywhere with really crappy nascar T-shirts that were old and stained. One of my guy friends even said something about it. He could have at least tried wearing a shirt that wasn\u2019t nascar. So I bought him some nice casual comfortable shirts to wear when we went out. So, they were so comfortable he slept in them and still wore the nascar shirts out in public. I think in this case I had a right to just get him to dress a little bit nicer. But your girlfriend is not only trying to get you to wear jeans that don\u2019t fit but also changing your personality. \n\nMy ex husband also asked me to buy him jeans and I always got him exactly what he wanted and knew it would fit him right.", "NTA, I think you were in the right for this, she should have considered your feeling a little bit more or just could have not got anything, \nEdit: you could have acted slightly grateful for her getting them for you BUT she didn\u2019t have to push you to wear them", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ignoring the tools? He would not have asked her if she wasn't all ready going out to the store. Geesh, talk about gaslighting.

UGH!", "Not only is it the same, it would be the same if it was a different color, joggers instead of jeans, or anything else.", "And tbh I honestly dont believe that they ran out. Regular fit jeans are the least chosen fit of jeans nowadays. I never worked at Target but when working at other clothing stores, we literally never ran out of Regular/Straight fit.

People carry weight differently.  My husband for years had pants that were loose on the waist but he had to wear that size to comfortably fit his legs, and butt.  It wasn\u2019t because he was fat, he just had a lot of muscle in his legs due to running and soccer.  Slim/skinny fit never worked with him either.  \n\nYou should ask her just why she\u2019s insisting on that fit for your jeans.
