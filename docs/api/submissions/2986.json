We have an international vacation date quickly approaching so a lot to get get done.\n\nYesterday I noticed a huge rip in the butt of my jeans and while my gf was heading out last night to Target for errands, I asked gf if she could pick me up jeans since I was working late. She said, *\"No problem\"* and I gave her my size.\n\nShe then paused before leaving to asked if I wanted those in **slim-fit**. I told her, *\"No thanks. Slim-fit is too tight around my thighs and butt.\"* She said, *\"Slim-fit is just a style, not a fit.\"* I responded, *\"I don't think so. I've had them before and they don't fit me at the weight Im at right now.\"* She argued, *\"Slim-fit just tapers off and gets narrow down the pants.\"* I retorted, *\"Exactly, it gets narrow, which changes the size, which changes the fit. Just get me regular jeans please.\"* We went back and forth a little longer and she finally shrugged, *\"Okay\"* and left.\n\nI am *very* insecure about the weight Im at right now and communicate that. So when gf got home bringing not just a pair of slim-fit, but skinny-fit as well, I was very upset.\n\nI said, *\"thank you very much\"*, gave her a hug, and went back to work. *\"Well aren't you going to try them on?\"*, she asked. I told her not right now. Truthfully I didn't want her to see me pathetically attempt to wear them. And for some reason she just persisted. Maybe to prove me wrong? I caved and sure enough, in front of her, struggled like a fat loser to get the jeans around my thighs and butt. I forced them up - the waist size was no problem, exactly as I asked - but the jeans were uncomfortably tight around my thighs and rear. And it was obvious to the point that now she had nothing to say other than, \"Well it's all Target had.\"\n\nFor the rest of the night, expressed in my attitude and voice was just genuine ungratefulness and I told her how I felt, and showed her Google results of what slim-fit meant. Not only did she specifically get me something I asked her not to, and bug me to put these unflattering jeans on, now I have to waste my time returning them. But now she's upset over my attitude because she claims, \"I was just trying to do you a favor.\" AITA for being upset at her?", "created_utc": 1669134850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1y2hx/aita_for_being_ungrateful_that_my_gf_got_me_what/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, if they are not comfortable then *why would you* wear them?  \n\nEvery couple fusses, my husband and I do this regularly... mostly over food.  If I ask for plain yogurt, then he buys flavored... and I don't eat it.  The list goes on and on.  After 25 years he's learned to buy what I ask for or nothing at all.  I wish I wasn't picky, but that is how I am.  I have tried to go shopping for myself... and then he gets mad that we're both making trips to the store.  Same goes for clothing, house decor, you name it.

If someone says no to doing something forcing them 9 out of ten times makes you the asshole. And at that point I'd have probably told her to f off and asked why on earth she thought it would be helpful when having pants you wont/cant wear is almost worse than having none.\n\nI dont buy my bf Jean's because theres no trackies left because they are uncomfy for him.

The words \"they didn't have anything\" would have sufficed and been respectful of my very clearly stated needs and preferences.

It still sucks, I don't like any of Team Ico's games. I've been single for 4 years. If you don't want to end up like, you wear those jeans. Even though you're right, you slap those bad boys on and strut your stuff King", "NTA\n\nShe should have known better. Most women have a type of jeans that looks best on them. Most men of your age wear regular jeans because you\u2019re an adult man. A recently single guy might (wrongly) wear tight jeans because they think it looks better and they want to meet someone. Guys that wear jeans that are really baggy seem immature. There was an article in a fashion magazine years ago only it was about which guy in which type of bathing suit is the best. They chose regular ones. Not too tight or too baggy. \nMost people as an adult only fit into one type of jeans that look good. A year ago I was looking for some sweat pants for my stepfather to wear in the hospital. At that time all of them had a very narrow legs. His feet were not only swollen but he was wearing some type of foot brace. None of the pants I saw would go over that, so I got him nothing. He was to have died soon so I just wanted him to be comfortable. But if he wasn\u2019t in the hospital he still would not have liked that. It definitely wasn\u2019t his personality. \n\nI do think some girlfriends and wives they to get their SO to look better. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with looking your best but it has to suit them and be comfortable. \n\nWhen I was married my husband would go everywhere with really crappy nascar T-shirts that were old and stained. One of my guy friends even said something about it. He could have at least tried wearing a shirt that wasn\u2019t nascar. So I bought him some nice casual comfortable shirts to wear when we went out. So, they were so comfortable he slept in them and still wore the nascar shirts out in public. I think in this case I had a right to just get him to dress a little bit nicer. But your girlfriend is not only trying to get you to wear jeans that don\u2019t fit but also changing your personality. \n\nMy ex husband also asked me to buy him jeans and I always got him exactly what he wanted and knew it would fit him right.", "NTA, I think you were in the right for this, she should have considered your feeling a little bit more or just could have not got anything, \nEdit: you could have acted slightly grateful for her getting them for you BUT she didn\u2019t have to push you to wear them", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can never understand people that don\u2019t shoot someone a quick text when necessary. She should have just told you Target was out of the fit or style you wanted.

Does she always think she knows better than you and make decisions unilaterally like this?", "NTA body shape plays a part.

I know that's how you felt, but you should know that nothing that happened in this story makes you a loser.", "NTA\n\nIf she was really trying to do you a favor, she would have done what you asked.  Instead, it was more important for her to try to prove you wrong and deliberately bought the jeans you said you didn't want.

She got your size in the available shapes. Unfortunately they only had slim fit and skinny fit. She wanted you to try them because she\u2019ll have to return them now.

If it\u2019s all target had in your size she was in fact doing you a favor, thinking well they have these he can try them on and if not we will find another solution. Also we cannot punish others for our insecurities.  It will not be in the end of the world to return jeans and get different ones.", "Actually I forgot to mention that.

How would that make you feel?\" and she responded all upset, \"Its not the same.\"", "Targets app has up to date stocks of everything at each store, op really should have just ordered through the app for curbside pick up and had the gf get it, or sent her a link to the exact pair he wanted, NTA, but come on OP, it\u2019s almost 2023 and you\u2019re ignoring the tools available to avoid this situation like it\u2019s 2005.", "Or she can return them...", "A well-rounded, thoughtful response. Thank you <3", "Also...enjoy your trip \ud83d\ude42", "You're spot on with this, and even with your assumptions. Ironically in this relationship, I'm the one who more-often-than-not has fashion sense. Before me, her wardrobe consisted of a limited set of frumpy grandma-style fleece sweaters. I never pushed her to change but she started asking for my opinion and taking more interest, I think, because whenever we went out, I was clearly putting in the wardrobe effort and she wasn't, and I think that was getting to her.\n\nSo after almost two years of her asking me for advice on clothes, to have her argue with me over my own jeans just felt so petty. And I'm not like, obese or anything. I'm active, just have a had a poor diet ever since starting a new job 6 months ago. So from the top-up I don't look overweight, but from the thighs and butt its clear, and she just doesn't have an eye or attention to detail, so probably didn't notice, idk.", "> you could have acted slightly grateful for her getting them for you\n\nHe could have.

This is a difference in style preference, like getting short cut jeans that end around your ankles because \u2018that is all they have.\u2019", "Better comparison is petite/long. If she is tall, get her petite, the size is the same.", "Even if she didn\u2019t notice, she should want you to be comfortable. But not noticing things can lead to problems. For example my mom has Alzheimer\u2019s and is in a nursing home. Her brother in law and his wife came to visit when I was there. They brought her chocolate kisses. I guess they didn\u2019t notice anything because she eats the paper strip in each candy. It\u2019s like having a child, you have to watch everything and they don\u2019t. \nTheir kids didn\u2019t either and it really showed when they had a baby."]}
