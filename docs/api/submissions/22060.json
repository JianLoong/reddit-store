It\u2019s that you are trying to play husband to two women whether you realize that or not. And your wife signed up to be your first priority. And it sounds like you are asking her to share priority in your life. I do not see how Sarah didn\u2019t have one other friend to take her to appointments and fix the nursery. You wanted to fill that role for her consciously or not. If you want to stay married you need to fully prioritize your wife and child versus your friend. She has become dependent on just you for support and that\u2019s not healthy for anyone in this dynamic. Good luck.", "YTA, we\u2019re you planning on being there if she delivered on time?  This is just too intimate a situation for a married man to be a part of, and of course he is going to have to help with her baby, cause Alone, right?  I don\u2019t thing the marriage will survive as his loyalties are divided", "YTA. Gee I can't imagine why your wife would be upset with you. You've shown her repeatedly that she comes second to your friend.", "YTA\n\nThe birthday isnt the issue.\n\nThe issue is that you have in essence abandoned your WIFE in order to be a de facto husband/father to sarah and the baby.\n\nWonder how much your relationship with sarah caused \"Sarah\u2019s husband to just up and leave\".\n\n\"stepped up for her with taking her to appointments, building the nursery and even promising to be with her when she gives birth\"\n\nAll of the time you spend with sarah (and away from your wife) during all these intimate ,emotional moments like ultrasound, building the nursery,and childbirth are only going to bond you to sarah and the baby more.\n\nNow if your marriage survives and you have a baby it wont be \"the first\" childbirth youve participated in, wont be the first nursery, and prob wont even feel like your first child.\n\nThere is NO WAY that sarah doesnt have anyone else. You are allowing her to depend on you  way too much. Despite coming from foster care i sure she has other friends that could go to hospital with her \n\nYou only have the bandwidth for one wife, not two.   You have chosen Sarah over your wife at almost every juncture, and have committed to continue the same pattern because surely your WIFE should understand that you need to be a stand in dad for the baby.\n\nSo even though you say you dont have romantic feelings for sarah, maybe you dont.  But whatever feelings you do have are strong enough that you put her first and neglect your own wife.", "YTA - Wanting to be there for a friend is great. And normally going into early labor would trump a birthday. But your behavior up to this point puts these things in an entirely different light. Even if you only have platonic feelings for your friend, it sounds like you are going down a road where you will be co-parenting with Sarah. Which is not what your wife signed up for. \n\nAlso - Sarah just happened to go into labor the night you had special plans for your wife's birthday? I call BS on that. I am taking wagers that is this was just a \"false alarm\" and Sarah will be home, healthy, and still pregnant in just a few hours.", "It is not about her birthday, it is about your pattern of behaviour. You are aware that your wife is uncomfortable with the depth of your friendship. You still put Sarahs needs above those of your wife. \n\nI get that you want to help a friend. But at this point you are not a friend anymore, you are a partner - to Sarah, not your wife. \n\nSarah needs you to support her giving birth (does it get anymore intimate than that?), so you abandon your wife. What will you do when she needs you once the baby is here? Your wife knows how it will continue to be, that is why she is so hurt. Realize your pattern and change it, if you want your marriage to last.\n\nYTA", ">I owe her my life and she\u2019s always been my go to when I\u2019ve problems\n\n>My wife (29f) has never liked Sarah since I had her as best woman at my wedding she calls her a pick me.\n\n>Their relationship got better when Sarah got married last year but unfortunately Sarah\u2019s husband just up and left a pregnant Sarah which has made her mental health spiral\n\n>Since Sarah has always been their for me I\u2019ve stepped up for her with taking her to appointments, building the nursery and even promising to be with her when she gives birth (she grew up in foster care No family) \n\nGee, I wonder why your wife doesn't like her?

Whether you mean to or not, you are showing your wife that Sarah is a bigger priority than her.  It's no wonder she suspects the child is yours.\n\nYTA", "I can see why your wife doesn't like Sarah. She's relying on you way beyond the bounds of friendship. It sucks she has no family, but girl needs some friends besides you. You can't maintain partnerships with both of them, you need to set boundaries. \n\nYTA for getting yourself into a situation where an emergency feels like abandonment to your wife. If you were there for her on most days, I think she'd be a lot more understanding about the early labor.", "you are cheating. YTA", "YTA. You got into this extra pregnancy buddy enmeshment *after* your wife had made it clear Sarah makes her uncomfortable. Doesn\u2019t seem like you cleared any of it with your wife before offering your help, either. She is your partner and the mother of your children, but you upended your family\u2019s life 100% unilaterally. \n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! After scrolling the comments, it is revealed that not only have you been prioritizing Sarah over your wife, but you\u2019re almost certainly neglecting your own three (*three*!) children as well, letting your wife fend for herself. I have *one* child. If my husband skipped off to play hubby/daddy for someone who has caused problems for us previously, and just left me to pick up all the slack, he\u2019d find a full set of hefty bag luggage on the lawn whenever he decided to come home. \n\nIt won\u2019t end when she gives birth, by the way. Pregnancy and childbirth are hard, but *raising* a baby is harder. There\u2019s also no end date. Sarah will \u201cneed\u201d you when she comes home with the baby, and then through the postpartum period, and then just till the baby is X age or goes to daycare or graduates high school and next thing you know, the kid has been calling you dad for 18 years so how can you leave now?\n\nHope you\u2019re ready to support 2 families while paying for a divorce lawyer.", "I can't believe I only just noticed that the only person in this story who was given a name is Sarah. Dude, you even prioritize her in your AITA story.", "YTA!\nI get you want to be there for Sarah however, you are married to your wife, your friendship has caused enough issues between you and your wife to the point of counseling and fights. \nWhen Sarah\u2019s husband left she should not be relying on another woman\u2019s husband for help and should have been figuring out which of her other friends could be with her for support. \nNow, I get she\u2019s in early labor. I\u2019d suggest calling a friend to come be with her if you want a wife to go home to", "YTA\n\nI would have left you a looonnnggg time ago. Nobody needs to feel like number 2. \n\nYour behaviour is inappropriate, you just can\u2019t see it.", "Please keep us updated. Did your wife let you come home or are you and Sarah a couple now?", "Why do you feel you need to be Sarah\u2019s hero while disappointing and actively hurting your actual WIFE- the person you\u2019ve legally committed yourself and life to??\n\nYTA and I guess it\u2019s cool you\u2019ll be able to tell your new step child that you were there when they were born because your actions and attention being paid elsewhere is ending your marriage as we type it seems (and honestly, rightly so!)", "YTA here, OP.\n\nI understand, but from what I see in the post and comments, you contantly choose Sarah over your wife.\n\nYour wife has every right to be suspicious with how intimate the relationship is.\n\nThis is also borderline emotional cheating.\n\nChoose one: Your wife or Sarah. You can't have both.", "I think you want to be Sarah\u2019s husband. Sarah should know better\u2026. YTA", "YTA. This is not about a birthday and you know it. This is a built up of issues that you caused. I feel for Sarah and I hope that she and her baby are safe and healthy.  \n\nYou should have set boundaries with her because from your own post and comments you show that you have regularly put Sarah above your own wife, and by doing that you have also put her above your own children.  You need more than couple\u2019s therapy, you should produce a paternity and set some boundaries.\n\nEdit: If you choose to set boundaries, that does not mean that you are abandoning Sarah. I think it\u2019s good that you are here for her, but push others in the friend group to step up if they haven\u2019t already. Also if you choose to do this, I would recommend keeping your wife\u2019s name out of it. Do not blame her, she is your partner and it seems like she has already put up with a lot of heartache from you.  It would be unkind to make her the bad guy in this. \n\nKeep in mind, at this point it sounds like she genuinely believes that you are/have been cheating on her. This is a delicate situation. \n\nAlso please update to let us know how Sarah and her baby are. I\u2019ll be thinking about them.", "YTA - This was me several years ago. I ditched my wife on her birthday to help my friend who had kidney stones (waited with her in the hospital for 9 hours). Fast forward a few years - my friend is my friend, but I am divorced. Lesson - Learn your priorities if you want to stay married.", "YTA. You have put someone else above your wife.  My wife has plenty of guy friends, they don't do this shit. Lunch, drinks after work, you are acting as a de facto husband and future father. My own family doesn't come before my wife and kids . Maybe if you dialed it back your wife might not be so pissed. When you have a fight with her and then run to the person you're fighting about, it looks like you're having an affair.", "YTA. Sounds like you treat your wife as a side piece to Sarah. Insane. You made your choice and it\u2019s not your wife.", "YTA.  You have three kids , who is picking up the slack with your children while you spend all this time with Sarah.  Did you take this active a role when your wife was pregnant? Did you go to every appointment? It seems like you are neglecting your wife and then calling her selfish.   You are the selfish one,  you are prioritizing your need to be Sarah's white knight over your wife's boundaries", "YTA.\n\nIt is not your job to be Sarah's pseudo-husband, defacto baby daddy, or anything similar. It *is* your duty to be your **wife's** husband and partner. You picking Sarah over your wife and children tells them that they don't matter. That they'll never matter. Why? Because Sarah.\n\nSarah exists so their feelings don't matter. Sarah needs you so their plans can wait. Sarah wants you so their needs aren't important.\n\nI'm in agreement with others here in asking why aren't you married to Sarah since she's your priority and your wife is the option.", "YTA \nAnd as you\u2019re helping Sarah get a lawyer and stuff figured for her divorce, keep those phone numbers.  \nYou\u2019ll go home to your wife and kids gone.", "YTA. Just Wow. You prioritize your friend over your wife at every opportunity and you wonder why she's angry that you ruined her birthday once again for her friend. If you didn't want to be married to your wife and you didn't love your wife and you weren't planning on making a place in the world with your wife you should have cut her loose so she can find someone who actually cares about her and not someone else. I completely understand that Sarah was in a vulnerable situation but she wouldn't have been depending on you to be in the delivery room if you had made her develop her own support system like oh I don't know her parents or siblings or Aunt or uncle anybody but you. Being friends is different than acting in the roll of her husband, which is what you've been doing. No wonder your wife is upset I would have told you not to bother to come back at all paternity test or no.", "Soft YTA. You may mean well, but this is *much* too intimate a relationship for you to be having with a woman who's not your wife, even if it's not romantic/sexual. It sounds like you've basically stepped into the role of surrogate partner/co-parent with her (taking her to appointments, setting up the nursery), but you're a married man, it's just not appropriate for you to play that role in another woman's life. Your wife isn't upset about her birthday celebrations, she's upset because your loyalties are inappropriately divided and this is yet more evidence. Sorry, OP, but if you want your marriage to last you're going to have to change your relationship with Sarah, you can't be her go-to person and be somebody else's husband.", "YTA I think you really need to take a real hard look at your relationship with Sarah and how it's impacting your marriage. I don't think you actually taken any of this seriously at all. You've seen your wife being openly hostile, which has caused fights. Instead of putting up boundaries with Sarah, you seemed to have gotten closer with her instead. Building a nursery, taking her to appointments. Doing everything a soon to be father would be doing, and not only that, you're going to be helping financially once the baby's here. You should feel guilty. You've constantly prioritised your friend over your wife. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if she was jealous of your friendship. What is your wife's name by the way? You've constantly brought up Sarah's, but you haven't once mentioned your wife's", "YTA, you\u2019re putting a woman and another man\u2019s baby before your wife. \n\nYour wife will leave you. You ditched her on her birthday so you could help your friend give birth. You\u2019re going to help decorate the nursery? Taking her to appointments? \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely delusional and i hope you, sarah and her bastard son have an amazing life together , your wife deserves a husband that will ALWAYS put her feelings first, not his female best friend.\n\nMaybe if literally BOTH of your families and all your friends are telling you you\u2019re a bad husband, maybe listen?? The only person who thinks you\u2019re decent is Sarah.", "YTA you have put Sarah above your wife repeatedly, of course your wife hates her, Sarah is more important to you than her.  All Sarah has to do is call you and you drop everything, your wife knows it and so does Sarah. BTW you wife is not wrong, Sarah is a pick me.  Sarah should never trump your wife and family, I don't blame your wife for being fed up with this situation, your wife is not being childish, she is over being second place to your emotional affair partner.", "You left your wife and your 7 week Old baby Because of a woman who clearly has No respect for your wife and family?!

On the bright side now you can shack up with Sarah and play daddy for her kid since she's obviously more important than your literal family.", "Yta\nYou left your wife's birthday , to go to another woman's birth", "YTA", "YTA. You're cheating, and you came here seeking justification for your cheating. Stay with Sarah, because given your wifes comments, you have no wife and kids left to go home to. Your wife is sick and tired of being cheated on, and you're essentially asking her to just let you continue cheating a little bit more and expecting your wife to be okey with it. I feel sorry for your wife and kids. They deserve more than you. I sincerely hope you learn from this.", "If none of these comments make you realize YTA let\u2019s flip the situation: Your wife has a male best friend who\u2019s been there for EVERYTHING! He was in your wedding, he talked down to you, he flirted with your other female friends, he is constantly messaging/calling your wife\u2026.. poor guy, he\u2019s a bachelor and can\u2019t cook or clean for himself so your wife graciously fills the role of homemaker for him.  Now it\u2019s your birthday and there\u2019s a whole party planned and an evening just for you and your wife! But ah wife\u2019s friend just burnt a casserole and needs her to come over immediately. She\u2019s a good friend so she tells you to just ask one of your friends to hang out with you and do all your birthday activities with you instead and then she goes to help her dear dear friend.  Then when you are hurt by it, she gets on here and asks if she\u2019s the asshole. \nYTA a major one. And you\u2019ll see that when your soon to be ex wife lives her best life without you and maybe someday she\u2019ll meet someone who actually treats her with respect", "So, I want to address this to you because I want you to see it. \n\nYTA\n\nYou depict Sarah like she's some angel. \"Oh, their relationship got better when Sarah got married.\" Don't lie. Your wife hated her then just as much as she does now. Why wouldn't she? \n\nYou left out Sarah insulted her in her speech at the wedding while you stood there like an egg head, doing nothing but supporting Sarah, as seems to be a constant theme. \n\nYou didn't say that Sarah was sleeping with most of your friend group - including the ones that are married - and that she treats almost all of her friends like crap which is why none of them want to be there for her. \n\nYou also failed to mention that Sarah cheated on her husband and that is why he left her and won't answer any calls. \n\nJust to top it all off, you didn't bother to add that you almost left your wife when she was giving birth because the almighty Sarah beckoned. The only reason you didn't is because your mother tore into you. \n\nYou keep making excuses, saying you would choose your wife over anyone. \n\nAnyone but Sarah, right? Sarah doesn't have anyone else. Given everything I've learned about Sarah, her having no one else seems to be her own fault. \n\nAm I sorry that her baby is sick and may not make it? Yes. Does that absolve her of all her past sins? No. She is just going to use it as another excuse to keep you at her side. Like always, you are going to cave and abandon the people who should matter for the person you've decided matters. \n\nSarah.", "I can understand your wife's pique - the timing seems suspicious.

Not only that but aren\u2019t you a parent? Why is it okay for you to just up and leave your child without consulting your partner? Child birth can take DAYS!

Your marriage will not survive this and having had three kids, you should know better!", "Odd he didnt say why her husband left\n\nOdd also that the soon to be ex in laws have abandoned her & baby as well as the husband unless there are other issues OP hasnt shared\n\nHe says he doesnt have romantic  feelings for her, but whatever he feels is enough to cause him to have basically abandoned his wife and 3 kids since sarah has been pregnant \n\nShe could have dealt with her morning sickness without him. What could he possibly do to help with that?  She could have had other people take her to appointments but she depend on him for everything she wanted. \n\nOP has def left important facts out of his story.\n\nSarah prob told her husband that OP was going to be in the delivery room with them, or instead of him.  People dont just \"up and leave\" a pregnant spouse and cut off all communication unless there is some issue.   I venture to guess OP is the issue.", "I personally think he does which makes the whole thing even more of a needless waste.", "He says he loves his children but honestly considering how he's at Sarah's beck and call I sincerely doubt he's an active participant in those kids lives.", "Yea but does she think of you as a brother or as a potential lover? I refuse to believe you don't know she has feelings for you.\n\nJust spare your wife the pain and divorce her won't you? I mean really? Playing daddy to Sarah's unborn child, doing all the things a father should for the child? I'm willing to bet if the both of you went out together, people would think you're a couple instead of \"a single mother with her best friend\". Get a grip.\n\nETA: saw the [wife's comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xyyhk/aita_for_helping_a_friend_in_a_bad_situation_on/jrq37tc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) and what I was guessing was right. Sarah was sleeping with their whole friend groups husbands, cheated on her husband, ops parents suspect the baby is his that's why he's so involved and wife is getting a divorce", "Yeah the sister that takes precedence over everything else including your family. I can see where your wife is wondering what\u2019s going on. And if your wife continues in this marriage this is gonna be her life, taking care of a kid that\u2019s not hers having her own kids be second to this kid. Having to share vacations special holidays this kid will be in her life for the rest of your marriage and I for one would not stand it. She needs to get out now instead of waiting 10 years and ruining her life. You made it very clear your wife is not a priority.\n\nI hope the wife reads this I just want to say to her I\u2019m very sorry this is no way to be treated. You need to move on with you and your kids and not be involved in this mess that he created.\n\nIf he wants to be with Sarah let him go. But you know in life you can\u2019t have it all he\u2019s not willing to choose because Sarah needs him so you know where you stand get some therapy for yourself to get the courage to move on with your life it sounds like you have family that will help you through this and I wish you a happy life with your children.", "Your actions and your words are incongruent. I really hope you're wife's second husband is the best ever!", "If my best friend went into labor 6 weeks early, even on my husband's birthday, I would go be with her. My husband would probably come too. Because we have a strong partnership and I don't have a history of prioritizing other people. It would be ok, because it would be a one time thing. \n\nThe reason this isn't the same for OP is because he does have a history of prioritizing Sarah.", "Yeah but... she has other friends... why call a married man whose wife is already on the edge when you can call another friend? She's not at death's door, she's giving birth.", "That sounds like a pretty codependent and unhealthy relationship", "I understand she doesn\u2019t have any family support, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange that at 28 years old she doesn\u2019t have *any* other support in her life? Don\u2019t you realize how inappropriate it is for her *only* support system to be a married man? And how bizarre it is that she wouldn\u2019t be bending over backwards to make sure your wife was comfortable with such a close friendship?", "Holy cat shit! Love that guy!", "I think you missed the sarcasm in the comment you're replying to!", "I was being sarcastic, dear.", "I like Warren's dad.", "I'm here for this!\nDon't let this ass ruin this birthday and all the rest kf your birthdays!", "Awesome! He deserves all the crap he gets", "Girl you and your soon to be ex-husband's family sounds awesome", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f well done girl!", "Well, for what is worth, happy birthday, and congrats on your freedom!", "Was coming here to say this", ">>if this isn\u2019t fake, anyway\n\nI want to believe it\u2019s fake so badly but damn I love me some real world leakage on AITA, so I\u2019m choosing to believe it\u2019s real.", "Imagine having to \"try\" picking your wife over your friend. I'm so embarrassed OP has the guts to say that in his comments lmaoooo", "Left his wife at home with a seven week old baby no less", "That man keeps saying he will pick his wife over anything while he sits in the hospital with his mistress lol", "I cant help thinking the OP would do well as a politician.\n\nAnd yeah, its certainly the most dramatic story I've ever seen on AITA and Ive been here for quite a while. Story is unfolding as we type!", "Yeah. So is wrestling, doesn\u2019t mean it is not entertaining. Just get some pop corn and enjoy", "Ya but it\u2019s entertaining af \ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s like reading the script of a poorly written telenovela", "I sure hope so because this is heartbreaking for the wife.", "Yea the comments argument was overdone. 3/10 experience", "I like the exact same shitty grammar and poor spelling in \u201ctheir\u201d replies\n\nEntertaining though", "I bet most people read this kind of subs in the bathroom, so just sit back and enjoy this toilet literature \ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udebd\ud83d\udca8", "If so, that's evil. Some of us really care.", "Then why would dear ol' hubbs not set the record straight about the baby?", "His wife was pregnant at the same time. She gave birth only 7 weeks ago.", "His own baby is only SEVEN WEEKS OLD!! Notice he didn't bother to mention that!", "Also wanted to leave his wife in the hospital after giving birth to go see Sarah because she was in the hospital as well. Clearly OP's priorities are NOT his wife and children.", "The other wives already told their husband's they couldn't", "Especially because now she\u2019ll have to share her birthday with Sarah\u2019s baby, and we know he\u2019s going to put that baby before his wife.", "Not only the birthday but all the other times he\u2019s put Sarah before his own family. He\u2019ll never give up Sarah and the kid. Oh I\u2019ll be the fun uncle know he\u2019s gonna be there for every mile stone with this kid he\u2019s going to be there to take the kid on vacation with just him Sarah and the kid. However therapy might bring out the truth. I believe that this is the reason the husband left I really think it\u2019s his kid", "And when she needs help when the baby wakes up through the night.", "He doesn't deserve his wife. She's put up with more than enough from him. And he's refusing to see the truth, no matter how many people tell him how wrong he is.", "[here\u2019s his wife\u2019s comment!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xyyhk/aita_for_helping_a_friend_in_a_bad_situation_on/jrq37tc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)", "He\u2019s not going to have a wife to go home to at this point", "OP's wife has posted. Sarah was dumped because she cheated .", "Exactly he\u2019s prioritizing Sarah over his own family. She would have lots of support at the hospital during this there was no reason for him to have to ditch his family and go to the hospital to be with her. I think that tells his family where they stand.", "I\u2019m sure she knows the wife is on the edge as well and that it\u2019s her birthday.. and yet she still chose to call another woman\u2019s husband.", "Going into labour 6 weeks early isn\u2019t a good thing for mother or baby it can be life or death", "I mean it\u2019s not unusual to lose the support system when you cheat and have another man\u2019s baby. Which husband and I laws will continue to care for a cheating wife?", "I don't know how. My trademark sarcasm was dripping from that response.", "I\u2019m aware, dear. I was simply clarifying that despite the sarcasm & what OP seems to think, she clearly wouldn\u2019t be alone.", "Imagine telling your wife youd always pick her over everyone, right after telling her you can\u2019t leave your \u201cfriend\u201d alone lol", "This part makes me so incredibly angry.", "Well what makes this even worse was he was supporting this woman through her pregnancy instead of his own wife more than likely. These woman were pregnant at the same time.", "Wrestling is fake? WTF!\n\nWell thats the last of my faith in human nature gone. Dammit!", "Yeah it was that and \"you know I love listening to AITA YouTubes on the way to work\", very clumsy exposition. I try not to call fake bc i am here for a good tale, but I can't enjoy the drama if there's no effort put in", "Seriously! I'm invested.", "\ud83d\ude31", "I would never in my life want to be with a man that didn\u2019t put me first. I can\u2019t believe his wife has stayed this long.", "Say no more, wife already commented lmao. Even this guy's parents think he's the father of Sarah's child and that Sarah cheated on her husband", "Oh he\u2019ll just be right there. His wife will wake up and wonder where he\u2019s at and he\u2019s left a note that oh I had to go to Sarah cause the baby was crying all night. Yeah we know where this is going", "I just saw that! I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed on fake, but I\u2019d believe it. I\u2019d do a lot to help my friends, but no.", "Could you please  post link to OP's wife's post?\n\nThis is good info \n\nIf sarah stepped over the line when pregnant  & married you know she wont have an issue stepping over with OP now that husband is out of picture", "It is not your role in life to always be there for sarah.  She had morning sickness, big deal. Almost all women do.  She couldve put the nursery together without you.  She could have gone to appts without you.  Newsflash she could have the baby without you too, many women are alone when they give birth.\n\nIf sarah was a true friend to you and cared about your relationship with your wife. She would not continually \"need\" your help.  She knows she causing problems and she doesnt care \n\nYou essentially have two wives and sarah is the person you put first, above your WIFE. \n\nBy doing all these intimate things with sarah you are taking those beautiful moments away from your wife.  If your marriage survives and your wife gets pregnant the ultrasounds nursery and childbirth won't be a \"first\" to share with your wife. Because you chose to disregard your wife's feelings and do all those \"firsts\" with someone else.\n\nSarah knows exactly.what she is doing and she does it because you allow and encourage it.\n\nIt is sad that sarah doesnt have family, but she surely has others who could help \n\nYour wife deserves better than the leftovers from sarah, your more important wife.", "Trust me I know that. But someone can take over. Unless you're the actual doctor.", "But it doesn\u2019t involve your family you just throw away your family for her when she has other people that\u2019s disrespectful to your own family. You have shown that you don\u2019t care about them and that Sarah and this kid comes first", "Dude your dads packing your shit up, enjoy your new wife and kid", "Again the hospital would take very good care of her there was no reason for you to ditch your family", "You can never be too sure. Some people don't understand sarcasm.", "But he's 'trying'!", "I know right. The man is still at the hospital instead of home.", "Its still real to me **DAMNIT**!", "Me either, especially because she knows she\u2019s just being knocked down another peg on his list of priorities!

There's more to the story that he hasnt shared.  Why would her in laws also abandon her and the baby unless there are other issues?", "Yep.\n\nThere is no reason that OP had to be the person to take her to appts and help with nursery and be there for the birth. \n\nAnd we can be certain that he is not just going to walk away after the baby arrives.\n\nHe will say the baby is sick and he needs to be there, or sarah wants someone to stay over and help at night so she can get some sleep, or sarah wants diapers and doesnt feel up to going to the store, ....yeah  whatever is between sarah and op is more important to him than his WIFE and 3 kids.  His words say no but his actions paint a diff picture.  When people's words and actions dont align, its the actions to pay attention to \n\nAnd he has in essence abandoned 4 people for the past 6-7 months for Sarah.", "There is now a post that is allegedly from OP's wife and she is dumping him."]}
