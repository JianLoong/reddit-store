My wife these last few months has been on this spiritual journey thing and she has started going to my sisters church. Background on my sister church they are your typical Christian people (God is great, you are bad and if you don\u2019t repent you are going to hell, if my god offends you then that\u2019s your fault, blah blah blah) I grew up in church when I was younger so I know how religion works with the pray it away and have faith but don\u2019t forget to tip god your 10 percent on a free tax me Sunday money. So ever since I was younger I disliked the idea of religion cause really who knows what happens when they pass. I believe more in the \u201clet people live how they want and if they die and face judgement on the other side then so be it\u201d but I\u2019m straying away from the subject. So she asked me the first day she went and I said no thank you, I don\u2019t feel the need to step into a church ever again. So then she asked me again 2 weeks later and I told her again no thank you and please stop asking. I don\u2019t want to go. She asked me again a week later and I started getting frustrated because I already told politely no 2 times so I just snapped and told her to stop asking me I\u2019m not going. She asked me again today and I kinda just blew up and told her \u201cI don\u2019t know what spiritual battle thing you have going on but it\u2019s something you have to deal on your own because I\u2019m not going to that stupid ass church.\u201d I feel bad cause I snapped but at the same time I\u2019ve told her plenty of times no and to stop asking. Aita? \n\nEdit: we have had talks in the past about how I felt about church and religion and she was okay with never going and just keep religion out of the home but now she\u2019s pushing for us to go.", "created_utc": 1679488404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yhprt/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_stop_asking_me_to_go/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should have taken your \u201cno\u201d the first time and not asked again. Since she\u2019s your wife I assume y\u2019all have had discussions about religion before so she should understand your viewpoint and let it go", "NTA. Why on earth does she keep asking if you\u2019re clearly declining? How annoying.", "NTA.  You politely told her no twice and asked her nicely to stop.  Having people ask the same question multiple times and expecting a different answer are annoying.", "NTA. You clearly said no and told her to stop asking and she carried on. I understand the frustration of having to repeat yourself numerous times. There are plenty of couples where one is religious and the other isn\u2019t and it works as long as everyone\u2019s boundaries are respected. - hopefully it can be the case for you guys somewhere down the line.", "NTA.\n\nI agree that once you told her not to ask again, she should have stopped asking.\n\nHowever, I think you need to come to terms with the fact that your marriage will be ending soon. If she's as involved as you say she is, she will likely decide that it's not good to be \"yoked with a nonbeliever\" (paraphrase of II Corinthians 6:14).\n\nI don't say this as a way to try to coerce you to go to church, \"If you don't go to church, your wife will divorce you!\" (You wouldn't be sincere anyway, if you went to church because you thought it would be the only way to save your marriage.) I'm just saying that, this scenario plays itself out often. When one partner discovers religion, then they decide that the other partner needs to be traded in for one who shares the faith.", "NTA.  I hope this does not escalate to the point where her sister and church become the prominent thing in her life.", "NTA. One of my biggest pet peeves in life is when people don't let you say no, and break you down until you say yes. \n\nYou were very clear that you have no interest - she's trying to wear you down. \n\nSnap at her every time going forward. Tell her to repent for how badly she's treating you - ok totally kidding but that'd be funny lol", "Definite NTA and it's hard to see how this won't become a big issue in your marriage. If your wife goes down this path, it SEEMS that part of this path is about recruitment. Even if she agrees to stop recruiting YOU are you going to be ok with that being her agenda in every social interaction the two of you have from here on out? \n\nI don't mean to vilify your wife - marriages can work in which one person is religious and the other is not. But you would need to be able to reach some agreement in which you don't get in the way of her own personal journey or religious habits and she doesn't let it impact the dynamic within your relationship or with other people. There may be other specific topics you also need to sort out, such as if you donate monetarily to the church, and other values and philosophies, but I'd start with the recruitment issue.", "NTA. Church is weird and I would respond the same way if someone kept insisting that I go.", "NTA. I am sorry to tell you this but your relationship is probably doomed. Your wife has entered a socially accepted cult that does not permit her to see anything in shades of grey. She asked, you said no. She asked again, you said no. You now have the first two data points in what will almost certainly become a pattern until one of you breaks it.", "NTA. Politeness ends after you got your answer the first time.", "This might eventually cause the breakdown of your marriage, unfortunately. NTA but your wife is and likely will become more of one - if she gets to a point where she truly thinks you\u2019re going to hell because you aren\u2019t going to church or on the same spiritual journey, that is wedge between you will be insurmountable. \n\nYou cannot have a healthy relationship when one person is trying to save the other person from a thing they don\u2019t want to be saved from.", "NTA it\u2019s ok for people to have their fandoms but it\u2019s not ok to try to pester someone else into joining.", "NTA - Also, I feel this is going to get bigger for your wife. You need to sit her down and discuss what she is needing from the church, what she needs from you, what you need, etc. Things may be brewing towards irreconcilable differences, her finding someone within the church, etc.\n\nI'd also watch very closely to finances. I'd hate it very much if the money I earned was funding a religious organization, but finances get tricky if they are pooled together.", "Nta. Ask her if this \u2018spiritual journey\u2019 is worth your marriage.", "Whew. I have a mother like this. Her response always is, \"I'll keep asking because you might change your mind sometime.\" Next time she was at my house I had a cheap bottle of whiskey ready. She hates whiskey. Can't stand it. So I poured a shot and put it in front of her. She asked, \"What's this?\" I replied, \"whiskey.\" She inquired why, as she knew I know she doesn't like it. I said nothing and just went out and poured a second shot and placed it in front of her. Same response. Same from me off ignoring her displeasure. This continued until she had 5 shots in front of her. When she now, severely displeased, asked me what I thought I was doing, I got a sickeningly sweet smile on my face and replied, \"I'll keep setting these in front of you because you might change your mind.\" My dad chuckled. Show never asked about church again.", "NTA\n\nBut if you don't go how will she ever save your soul from the fiery pits of hell?\n\nIn seriousness though it sounds like her particular brand of religion doesn't leave a lot of room for non-believers. She is going to keep asking you because, in her mind she is trying to save you.\n\nI decided a while back that I don't have time in my life for people that think I should go to hell (however they envision it). I have had one exception to my rule, my grandmother, and that is because she became obsessed way before I met her and I think there is no hope for her to change. Even she, however, had the courtesy to not try to pressure me to go to church (eventually).\n\nThis might sound like an overreaction, but if your wife cannot truly accept that you are non-religious, and that it is *okay to be non-religious*, then you might be incompatible. You deserve someone who accepts you.", "NTA. She needs to accept your no for an answer and respect your decision. \n\nIf anything, she could just say that you're welcome to join her if you ever change your mind, but that's about it. \n\nAsking over and over again and expecting a different answer is being pushy and disrespectful.", "NTA.\n\nAs an atheist myself, I've met people trying to change my mind - even trying to push me to go with them just to \"see what is like\". I have the freedom to not believe and I would never try to force someone to change their mind when it comes to religion, it is in their freedom to do what they want as long it's not hurting someone.\n\nThis can be applied to you and your wife, you said no plenty of times and yet she ignored it until you got so frustrated you snapped at her, that's a consequence to her actions. You never questioned but respected her decision though you have all the freedom to not go with her. Most religions talk about giving respect to people and spouses, looks like she's not really following those rules that much.\n\nWhile I would apologize for snapping, she needs to understand not everyone is a believer and no is a complete sentence, she's free to believe, you're free to not believe. Simple as that.", "NTA\n\nI cannot stand people trying to force their religion on me, there's absolutely no way I would have been as polite as you or as tolerant. \n\nIf she can't respect your answer, then this is a problem you're going to have to have a strong discussion about until she at the very least understands that she needs to stop asking.", "You don't understand! Your soul needs to be saved, dude!! How can a simple \"no\" stop her from saving you? You are a sinner, but there is HOPE for you, if you just stop pushing away the ppl trying to save you. I think she needs to involve her pastor in this, since she alone can't get through to you, sigh. You are a hard case, but if you are just willing to let jesus save you, all will be good and you will become a very strong believing member of gods holy family. Don't give up on yourself my dude, there is help waiting for you in this church. \n\nNTA ;)", "NTA. You said no and she needs to take that answer. Maybe ask why she\u2019s pushing it so hard, but you don\u2019t need to go. Possibly get something in place in case the \u201cif you don\u2019t go I want a divorce\u201d thing happens like an emergency contract for separation.", "Invite her to do something she doesn't want to do for 2+ hours after having to get dressed up. \n\nChurch?!? Sure right after you caddie for me. Oh you don't want to spend hours of your day bored and all dressed up? Funny how that sounds eerily relevant to my Sunday morning interests.\n\nNTA", "NTA i dont get the N A H votes, she knew your stance on religion, you asked her to stop asking politely, yet she keeps pushing and pushing, its legit to snap and be a little less nice about it when you get disrespectes, it being about church is zero excuse on her side, frankly i think it makes it worse", "NTA especially with the context that you have had these conversations in the past, it\u2019s extremely rude to try and force religious beliefs on someone. Protect your peace.", "NTA. You've said no politely twice, not politely once after that, and now you were rudely blunt. Personally that's at least 2 more chances than I'd have been able to be nice.", "NTA.", "NTA. Churches like that prey on women to \u201clead\u201d their husbands to church with them and shame them if they can\u2019t.", "NTA. I would be annoyed too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might want to reiterate to her that you don't care if she goes and are happy that it makes her happy, but you will not be joining her. I say this mostly to emphasize to her that you're not going to judge her for finding happiness there, but that it is something she will be doing without you.", "A lot of times church fanatics will not take no for an answer. They are taught to keep pushing until that no becomes a yes. \n\nThe only way to deal with people like that is to be rude and direct. Politely declining is more of an incentive for them to push and prod until you get so annoyed you just say yes to get them off your back. \n\nNTA. But you need to realize your wife probably won\u2019t stop trying to \u201csave\u201d you.", "NTA.\n\nYou've been civil and polite and it isn't working. What she's doing is not ok.\n\nI don't know what kind of church/cult she's gotten involved in, but given her level of pushiness and disrespect I'd keep a very close eye on finances (make sure she's not \"donating\" your savings to her cult).", "NTA y\u2019all will be considered \u201cunequally yoked\u201d and all of her friends will be praying for your soul and how hard it is on her to be married to a non believer. Expect a bumpy ride", "NTA\n\nBut it may be time to sit her down and say that this is a hard boundary for you.  You will never be a part of her new church and if she doesn't stop pushing you to go when she knows how you feel, then it may be time to seriously consider what that means for your future and if she can be happy with someone who doesn't have the same faith.  You haven't said anything negative about her faith (hopefully), so she needs to be able to respect that you are no longer a religious person.  If she genuinely can't respect that you don't want to go to church anymore, then you may no longer be compatible together.\n\nFaith is about your -personal- relationship to what you believe in and how it potentially enriches your life.  Not just showing up at a building and giving money to a business that profits off of believers.  If her faith requires that she convert you to please these people because thier opinion matters more to her than you, then you may have to go your separate ways.", "This is only my opinion, and probably not  popular. Organized religion is a business. Churches basically tell you that they're the gatekeepers of heaven, and you have to pay to get in. I also believe there's a difference between being religious and being spiritually aware.\n\nNTA. This subject was previously closed with both parties in agreement. Your wife didn't keep her promise to you. I'm glad you recognized that snapping at her wasn't the best reaction. The only thing you can control is you and your emotions. Maybe you could tell her if you ever change your mind, you will let her know. I wish you the best, OP.", "NTA - your wife is probably being told to ask you. It's pretty common to be told to \"have faith and trust in the Lord. Don't be swayed by a No! Let him see God's Love in you.\" They believe that if she keeps asking one day, you're just gonna break down crying and go.\" Oh God, how did you know?!??! I've been waring with myself for so long! Thank you for NEVER giving up on me. \"  It's a song and dance I've heard and seen my entire life. \n\nProstilizing is the \"duty\" of a true Christian cause you're not a Christian unless you've left the Holy Bible imprinted on their forehead. \n\nIf it were me, I'd say this. \"Thank you for carrying about my soul, but it's my soul, and I'm allowed to treat it however I want. I respect your passion on the subject, but I have no interest in Church, and if I change my mind, you'll be the first to know.\"", "NTA. You told her politely 3 times to stop.  When politeness doesn't work, it's time for bluntness.", "NTA.\n\nYou should not need to repeat yourself this many times. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA. Your wife sure is though!", "NTA", "NTA. Your wife is for trying to push her religious agenda on you. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she is getting pressure from your sister and other church members to bring you back.", "NTA. I have been an atheist for many years. I do not date people who have religious faith for obvious reasons. If my spouse suddenly found Jesus and then started pressuring me to find Jesus that would be a dealbreaker and the marriage would be over.", "NTA, it's absolutely okay if you don't want to go to church and you have made it clear multiple times to not ask you. If she asks again, try to have a calm conversation with her as to why you don't want to go and that she needs to asking.\n\nIn regards to the edit, allow her to express herself when it comes to her beliefs, but make compromises and boundaries. It's important for her, so it'd be good to allow her ways to keep it close to her, but make sure to talk about boundaries when it comes to your home.", "NTA for deciding what you do or dont do with religion.  Info missing from your post is whether you\u2019ve had the conversation with your wife on your past experience with church and what\u2019s driving how you feel about church now ?  Or do you just decline to go ?  If you\u2019ve explained everything calmly and wifey keeps asking, then it can be understandable you recently got impatient.", "NTA. You can only bend a tree over so far before it finally snaps and you snapped. Your wife needs to respect your answer of no and move on. If she won't respect that, then I don't blame you for snapping at this point.", "NTA. She can go on her spiritual journey, that\u2019s fine. When it becomes not fine is when she starts pushing that shit onto anyone else.\n\nShe needs to respect your boundary, period.", "NTA.  Just tell her you decided to give church another chance and you want her to attend with you.... at the Satanic Church. And then continue to ask her every time she asks you. \n\nBut on a side note, be prepared. I have seen multiple marriages end when one spouse becomes overly religious. I have lost a few friends myself. ( I don't believe in the church)", "NTA - she sounds like those Church of Latter Day Saints that go door to door despite being told numerous times and probably threatened, yet still go out. She's being indoctrinated into that church. (Read brainwashed) \n\nNot much you can do at this point. Except maybe every time she asks, ask her to attend a Satan worshipping group with you. You both politely decline.", "NTA..\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t seem to want to hear the word No\u2026\n\nReligious or not, that\u2019s just plain disrespectful, especially since you both have talked about your views on church and religion, etc.\n\nSome people don\u2019t want to hear the word No unless it\u2019s yelled at them and if that\u2019s what it takes to get that through your wife\u2019s head, then that\u2019s what it takes. You have nothing to feel bad about OP. She disrespecting you so of course you snapped..\n\nIf this insistence on her part doesn\u2019t stop, you may want to consider marriage counseling for you both\u2026", "NTA\n\nNo means no, on any matter. She can ask if you've reconsidered sometime maybe, but repeatedly asking within a week or two of being turned down, especially after you've discussed this topic before and made your feelings known, is an AH move.", "NTA, she's a typical Christian who can't accept that people have different beliefs than her and wants to pressure you into conforming to hers.", "nta consent is a 2 way street maybe you should send her something which explains the concept of consent", "NTA, sit down apologize for snapping at her.  Tell you have discussed your feelings about church before. Her asking you to go is beyond annoying and to stop asking you.  Tell her this is a boundary for you, that she is disrespecting you by continuing to ask.  You will let her no if that changes.  You have no problem with her going, but your at peace with your decision.", "NTA ibhate it when churchy people get all pushy. Just live and let live, man. This is her spiritual journey, not yours! She doesn't need to pressure you into it too.", "NTA  She is probably being pushed to bring you by the other members of the church. Couples therapy might be called for, there is an unaddressed problem that your wife felt she needed to suddenly start going and has taken everything they say to heart without question.", "NTA, but your wife is. She's has some sort of religious renewal, and it's very common for people in her situation to try to share their \"awakening\" and \"good news.\" With others.\n\nDon't fight. Just keep saying \"No, and I'm not discussing it\" and change the subject.  If she pushes, walk away. Repeat as necessary. You have my sympathy.  My ex got like that when he started going to AA. It's maddening.", "NTA. You've already told her no several times. I'd have snapped too.", "NTA\n\nNormally, if you hadn't had previous negative experiences with a particular religion, or some sort of trauma related to that religion/identity... I tend to suggest accepting an invitation to visit. Not for the religion, but for the relationship with the loved one who is inviting you. \n\nI'm Christian, my next door neighbor is Muslim. She's invited me to her mosque. I've invited her to my church. Neither of us was attempting to *convert* the other, but rather to share experiences.  We both learned things. I will not hesitate to say, I probably learned more than she did. It made us closer, because there's that little bit of understanding.\n\nA couple of years ago, I found a new home church. My teen was 11 or 12 at the time (then agnostic, now atheist) and did not normally go to church with me. However, I was excited. I'd discovered something important to me, and I wanted to share with people I love.\n\nMy child went to the service, said they were happy for me, and that it was \"interesting\" and \"not bad\", but it wasn't an experience they'd want to repeat. They can now visualize the people and the place I'm referring to if I mention something that happened there. My kiddo has questions sometimes: \"Oh! Is that the lady who said I was 'too precious'?\" and we can communicate better because of that.\n\nThat said... none of these places I've referred to are the level of judgemental to which you've indicated your wife's church ascends. And you *do* have previous negative associations with Christianity.\n\nIn light of that, I think this:\n\n>So she asked me the first day she went and I said no thank you, I don\u2019t feel the need to step into a church ever again.\n\nWas perfectly reasonable. Especially since you've discussed it before.\n\n>So then she asked me again 2 weeks later and I told her again no thank you and please stop asking. I don\u2019t want to go. \n\nThis attempt, I'd likely have written off as your wife, who loves you, wanting you to have the same joyful experience she'd had. And your response as perfectly appropriate/legitimate.\n\nAt that point, in your wife's shoes, I would likely have said something like, \"well, it's an open invitation, if you ever change your mind,\" and left it at that.\n\n>She asked me again a week later and I started getting frustrated because I already told politely no 2 times so I just snapped and told her to stop asking me I\u2019m not going. \n\nThis was pushy and inappropriate on your wife's part. And your frustration and your reaction are understandable. Even if your tone was a bit harsh, I think it was justifiable, and you didn't say anything inappropriate.\n\n>She asked me again today and I kinda just blew up and told her \u201cI don\u2019t know what spiritual battle thing you have going on but it\u2019s something you have to deal on your own because I\u2019m not going to that stupid ass church.\u201d \n\nYour wife crossed a line here. She's definitely ignoring your boundaries. \n\nThe only (mild) fault I can find in your response is the:\n\n>stupid ass church\n\nI can see how your wife might feel like that was a personal attack on her belief and her community, rather than on her behavior. However, we have an increasingly reduced obligation to be polite/courteous when someone is consistently being discourteous to us. I feel that reply was... if not necessarily \"justified\", at the very least understandable and not too over the top in light of her seeming inability to accept a polite \"no\".\n\nI don't think you were an AH. I think your wife *was* being an AH, though not deliberately. I think she's probably being over-zealous because... well, it can be like that when you first find faith. That said, just because she doesn't have ill intentions doesn't mean she's not an AH. \n\nSo... yeah... you're NTA.\n\nBut... as some of the other comments have pointed out... there is scripture about relationships in which you are unequally yoked. And depending on your wife's belief set, she may feel like your attendance in church (at least superficially) is now necessary for her to remain with you. \n\nThat doesn't mean you have to go with her. Sometimes people change and grow apart. \n\nI might have suggested going once just so she'd feel you tried, if she hadn't been so ... pushy... about it. I think if you *went* just once, now, to keep the peace or whatever... she'd feel like she \"won\", and it would cause *more* issues with this in the future.\n\n> I feel bad cause I snapped\n\nBecause you feel bad, I'd address that. I might suggest setting a boundary during a day that's *not* a church day. Have a sit down conversation and say something like. \"I regret snapping and my word choice, but I will not accept having my boundaries ignored. I will not be going...\" blah blah, whatever else. Firm, but calm.\n\nIf your wife accepts that and chills out... maybe be open to a brief visit on a special occasion, maybe not. Up to you. It's your life, your beliefs, and you have a right to your boundaries.", "NTA \n\nNo means NO, and when someone says so, you stop.", "NTA\n\nNo means fucking no.  There's no other explanation needed here.", "NTA. I would honestly divorce someone for a sudden spiritual awakening. No religion for me ever.", "Christians tend to have a hard time with the word \"no\". They are the most goddamn persistent people in the world, besides the federal tax bureau.", "NTA. No does mean no, but at least be glad she wants to include you in her life. However, maybe you should go at least once to see for yourself what she's getting into. Sounds like she is being pressured to \"bring in the lost sheep\" or something. That group of new church \"friends\" could end up driving a cross-shaped wedge between you two.", "Sounds to me like you SHOULD go along, to find out what kind of shit they're trying to shovel into your wife's and SIL's head. Members of the church might use this as a way to isolate her from you. Best to know what you're battling!", "NTA but you better do something soon if you love this women. You know where this is going.", "How long have you and your wife been together?\n\nFull disclosure, I was raised Christian and I still participate in religion. It\u2019s a big part of my life, but I also understand why so many people choose to have nothing to do with it after childhood. My husband is also involved in our church, and it would hurt me deeply if he chose to walk away from it. Conversely, I bet your wife feels very hurt at the idea of you not getting the same spiritual fulfillment that she finds. \n\nHowever, she had no need to ask you more than once. I could see her persisting reasonably, but only if your circumstances change. You\u2019ve declined her invitation, and now she isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries. \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.\n\nI do worry how your relationship may go forward from here. I\u2019m sure you guys never discussed the possibility of religion and what kind of role it would play in your marriage because you assumed you would never have to have that conversation. It would be a dealbreaker for me if my husband stopped, going to church, and I\u2019m sure it would be a dealbreaker for him if I stopped going to church. Our marriage is conditional on us both being involved because that\u2019s important in our religion.\n\nIt\u2019s probably time for a serious conversation with your wife. You don\u2019t necessarily need to ask her why she insists on you getting involved, but what the expectations are for the both of you moving forward. Clearly you need to establish the importance of your boundary that she not ask you to participate in religion, but she also needs to communicate her boundaries to you. Be honest with yourself and with each other about what the best way to move forward is.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I\u2019ve had a very similar background with religion.  Sounds to me like someone is getting their hooks into her, and more than likely they\u2019re giving her a lot of crap because she is going, but you aren\u2019t.  You need to have a serious conversation with her about her mental health.", "NTA. I sometimes go to church on Sundays because it calms me down (I'm not very religious but the quietness of churches brings me a sense of peace in the large city). My partner is not religious. I asked her once, she refused and that was it. I never asked again because I understood. It's easy to respect other people's boundaries. If she's insisting this hard however your relationship might be on its way out unless a conversation is had.", "Nta.  Let's assume the bibpe is right.  Her witness or invitation will not save you.  Only god working to soften your heart can accomplish her goal.  She has two options to be faithful to her beliefs.

My wife these last few months has been on this spiritual journey thing and she has started going to my sisters church. Background on my sister church they are your typical Christian people (God is great, you are bad and if you don\u2019t repent you are going to hell, if my god offends you then that\u2019s your fault, blah blah blah) I grew up in church when I was younger so I know how religion works with the pray it away and have faith but don\u2019t forget to tip god your 10 percent on a free tax me Sunday money. So ever since I was younger I disliked the idea of religion cause really who knows what happens when they pass. I believe more in the \u201clet people live how they want and if they die and face judgement on the other side then so be it\u201d but I\u2019m straying away from the subject. So she asked me the first day she went and I said no thank you, I don\u2019t feel the need to step into a church ever again. So then she asked me again 2 weeks later and I told her again no thank you and please stop asking. I don\u2019t want to go. She asked me again a week later and I started getting frustrated because I already told politely no 2 times so I just snapped and told her to stop asking me I\u2019m not going. She asked me again today and I kinda just blew up and told her \u201cI don\u2019t know what spiritual battle thing you have going on but it\u2019s something you have to deal on your own because I\u2019m not going to that stupid ass church.\u201d I feel bad cause I snapped but at the same time I\u2019ve told her plenty of times no and to stop asking.
