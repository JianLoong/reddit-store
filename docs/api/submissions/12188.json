In every aspect She's an amazing person, and I love her dearly. Last night , we sat each other down, and we just had an open and true discussion about our relationship and where we saw it progressing. I was happy to hear that she had been thinking about marriage eventually and starting a family because so had I. Some time during the conversation, she states that before we were to even talk about marriage further she wanted to know if I would get my tattoo removed, because she just didn't like the idea of marrying a guy who had a tattoo dedicated to their ex, and I said there was absolutely no way.\n\nI was with my ex Kate since our last year of middle. She was my first love. She taught me everything that makes me the man that I am today. We experienced so much love and life together, so when she passed away when we were 24, it broke me. I became a person I didn't even recognize, and although her passing was expected, it took a lot out of me. It took years and hard work in therapy to get to the point I'm at now. With that being said, K loved penguins, all penguins, but her favorite penguins were  Magellanic penguins. At one point, we had a membership to our local aquarium, and we would go there every Thursday just to see the penguin exhibit. So shortly after Kate passed, I got a Magellanic tattooed on my thigh, and it's been there for the past 9 years. It's no bigger than my palm, but I refuse to get it removed. When my gf was made aware of my stance on the tattoo, it led us into an argument and ended with her leaving, she called me an asshole and said that no woman should have to be reminded of their boyfriend's ex everyday. \n\nI'm asking if I'm the AH or not because although this tattoo means a lot to me, i can see why my girlfriend is upset and I'm honestly not trying to hurt her but I can't part with this tattoo.

She was my dad's true soul mate, it literally destroyed him. \n\nHe ended up marrying my stepmom about 7 years later. They had a really rocky marriage, like bad. About 12 years later, they sat down together and realized that my dad had never actually left my mom, she was taken from him. He still loves her and misses her, and he always will. \n\nMy stepmom accepted this, and allowed him to still love her. My dad loves my stepmom very much (I do not but that's another story!) and her allowing him this space actually fixed most of their problems. He relaxed, let go of a lot of anger, and stepmom found a way to let some empathy into her cold, black heart...\n\nAnyways, your girlfriend needs to learn a little empathy and find some understanding with this.

It's not like Kate's ever going to come back into your life again, so there really isn't any competition on any level here.\n\nYou already stated that you love your current g/f dearly, is that not enough for her?

Don't give up your memories or the love you have for your late gf. The right person will appreciate you even more for being a deep feeling sentimental person.

Reassure your gf that she\u2019s not second choice and your not just with her because your ex passed, your with her because you love her and chose her! When a significant other has passed and is set in such a high bar(which is completely fine) it can be intimidating for your new partner especially if they feel like they will always be second best. I would suggest maybe a few sessions of therapy to talk about this subject before getting married so it doesn\u2019t cause any tension or problems in the future.", "NTA, they\u2019re not a threat to your current gf / current relationship so why is she so against it?", "NTA. If your current gf can't change her opinion on that, you should reconcider the relationship. She seems to have very little respect for you or the factors that made you the person you are.

And that incudes that tattoo which is part of you as a whole person, not something that can be erased.", "The ex title is for breakups not deaths. Your tattoo is more a memorial than anything else now. Your girlfriends insecurities towards a dead woman are unhealthy at best, toxic at worst. This isn't even getting into the serious violation of personal autonomy your girlfriend is demanding, because it isn't any man or woman's right to place such an expectation onto to you.\n\nAlso, having looked up what a magellanic tattoo is I find it ludicrous that she's pissed off about the tattoo. It sounds like it's not your standard image of a heart with someone's name and the word \"RIP\" or some such, it sounds like it's a picture of a fucking penguin. Home girl is throwing an absolute tantrum and harassing you about an inked penguin on your thigh. She's upset purely out of the motivation of the tattoo and not the tattoo itself, she's insecure about you having a history before her.\n\nNTA", "So, the tattoo is of just a penguin, without your late gf's name?  I wouldn't mind either way, but if it's just the penguin it's even less of a deal.  You may want to have another conversation with her.", "NTA. She is jealous of a dead woman. Honestly thats a deal breaker. Imagine what other small things she will get jealous over.", "NAH. \n\nThis is a hard one. Obviously having a tattoo for your late-girlfriend is different than having a tattoo for a living ex, however I imagine it must be hard for your partner to have the constant reminder that she\u2019s just a consolation prize to you. You might not put it in those terms, but it\u2019s hard to know that your partner would choose to be with their dead partner if they could. Under normal circumstances, people can generally expect that their partner would choose them over their exes, even if they were the one who was broken up with. That expectation helps us feel secure with our partner\u2019s past. People who date someone with a deceased partner don\u2019t get that security, but it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still need it. Whilst Reddit likes to say they have no right to be jealous, it is really difficult to live in the shadow of someone who can do no wrong and has had their memory perfected by death.\n\nAll this is not to say that you should get the tattoo removed. But when she asks you to remove the tattoo, what\u2019s she\u2019s really saying is that she needs to know you actually want to be with her and don\u2019t view her as a poor substitute for your true love. This stuff is really complicated, and could really benefit from the input of a good couple\u2019s counsellor. If you could start by acknowledging how hard this scenario is for her, she might soften on the tattoo.", "Nta", "NTA, your life your body, your history! Try to help her understand the reasoning and meaning (not during fighting) and make her realize you are you - also because of your past relationships and experiences? I do also understand your GF unhappiness (but she is exaggerating in way she behaved- that is uncalled for) as it is impossible to compete with a passed partner, certainly if she is aware she would never be your gf if your partner would still live. At least this is how she might feel.  Perhaps you can add something around the  tattoo just for your GF  (later- if you stay together) to make her feel equal? Competing  with first and most important love will be difficult for anyone, and even more difficult is if that person passed.", "NTA. How can someone be so insecure of a dead person?

Even in that case, it's still your body and therefore your choice. \nI hope she can address her insecurity and leave alone Kate and her memory. I'm sorry for your loss op. Good luck for your future.", "Why don't so many people realize that someone who has passed is no threat to them?

Unless you both isolate with only one another you\u2019re both going to have emotional commitments to other people.

That is where there may be a legitimate problem. If you withhold affection, or do things like Kate is still there to moderate what you do or say, then the tattoo is just a reminder of the behavior. But if she is concerned simply with the fact that you hold Kate in your headspace, without there being behaviors that take away from y\u2019all\u2019s relationship, then she needs to address that issue herself.\n\nI wish you both luck with this.

It's about the size and placement. Op states that the tattoo is no bigger than the palm of his hand and is located on his thigh. That's a decent size tattoo.

Hell op himself can probably see the dang thing whenever he's intimate with himself. Had op picked a better spot and made his penguin smaller, like half the size I bet his gf would have little to no problem with it.

My mom actually asked me what if she finds a new person to love and my response was simple \"if he can't recognize the deep impact -husband name- had on -friend- then he isn't good enough for her\"\n\nIf someone wants to memorialize someone in a tattoo that is their right and part of the grieving process. Asking him to remove it is like asking him to remove all they went through (good and bad) and all that made him into the person he is today.  It makes no sense to be jealous or upset over a memorial tattoo.", ">He\u2019s giving part of his emotional energy to another person.\n\nOf course he is!  Every person in our life that we have loved in any way, for any time, is given a part of our \"emotional energy\".

When you lose someone you love it breaks us and sometimes picking up those pieces you miss a few and things just aren't the same.

The capacity for love is infinite, and there is space in his heart to love and remember her, and to love me, as well.

She shouldn\u2019t try and force her boyfriends hand and give him ultimatums about someone who he knew since childhood who passed away, it\u2019s unbelievably petty to start a problem with a woman who\u2019s never coming back anyway, and a tattoo that wasn\u2019t even put on his body until after she was gone. \n\nEdit to ask: are you the current GF?
