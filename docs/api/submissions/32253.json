Atm, my girlfriend eats whatever she wants, but I'm trying to look out for my body.   \nAm I the asshole in this case for refusing to go?   \n\n\nTL;DR: I don't want to go eat hotpot because I had some yesterday and girlfriend told me I never want to do anything with her because I always refuse her invitation.

Even in just this post, you disregarded how your gf felt multiple times or even admitted you straight up ignored her when she was talking to you and walked away from her, which is incredibly rude. Your relationship sounds dysfunctional and potentially one-sided, with her putting in more effort than you, but it is hard to really tell here. You need to really sit down and listen to your girlfriend and stop yourself from trying to disregard how she feels. Also, if you are living together and you have only done one thing she has wanted in 1-2 weeks (going shopping) that is kind of sad, and she probably has a point about you never doing anything or never thinking about her. Even here, the entire post is about you and what you want, but did you at all stop to think to include her in what you want other than excluding yourself from what she wants? Like even if you don't want hotpot, couldn't you have included her in what you did actually want to do? Or at least try to find something that both of you like together?", "Questi0n, she said you eat \"bento boxes\" every week day. Does she also eat the same?  If so, YTA if she eats the same as you every week day, but you won't accommodate eating what she wants 2 days in a row.", "NTA, but it's not about hotpot. You say you do things with and for your GF, she says you don't. Her reaction \"maybe I should ask you ever to do anything with me ever again since you always refuse...\" That's childish and petty. If she really feels like this, then the relationship is over. And you turn off and walk away...  Childish too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You just saying no, I want a bento box, not giving a recommendation as to where you could go out to eat, would potentially be a trigger for me too, if that's how it usually goes.\n\nI guess it's her way of saying \"you never take initiative for dates\". NAH, but I think you should step up your game or you'll lose her.", "If it's just about this isolated hotpot issue then you're NTA. But I feel like she is using this hotpot issue to lash out at you for something else... So to really know if you're the AH or not we would need more info about the context and the bigger picture.\n\nPersonally I think walking out is fine since she was not engaging in effective communication anyway.", "NTA but could you imagine a world where you go out together, you get something healthy for yourself, she gets hotpot, and you eat together?", "NTA for the specific question asked - it's your right to refuse to go out if you don't want a particular meal. However ESH for other reasons. Your gf is clearly lashing out because she wants you to spend more time with her or do things she has interest in, but she is an AH for the way she reacted to you. Saying she'll never ask you to do anything with her again is suuuuper petty and childish. You're an AH for walking away from an argument, even if she was being childish. Relationships are about compromise and it seems both of you aren't very good at doing this. Neither of you deserve a medal for doing things the other likes. That is literally what relationships are about, you indulge in the other person's interests and when they don't align, you respectfully take your space and do what you each want. A compromise would have been picking a place that is in between hotpot and bento, or somewhere both of you would have enjoyed. If you truly wanted a mental health break as you said in one of your comments, then that should have been your reason to her.", "NTA but you might need to have a very open conversation about time spent as a couple. She\u2019s seems to be feeling neglected (not to say she\u2019s using the right way to communicate that to you)\n\nAs for your fitness goals, good luck! As someone who needs to not get tempted with greasy food I totally get you here", "Update: the problem has been resolved. \nShe apologized for her immature response and I apologized for saying no without reason then explain to her why I said no and why I didn\u2019t want to go because mentally I just couldn\u2019t deal with a crowd today. She understood because I suffer from depression and tries to understand about my mental illness. We went into a deeper conversation and she said she\u2019s sorry for always saying hurtful words and thinking the worst of any situation and blaming me for everything and explained that her work has been very stressful. I also apologized for walking away during the argument and told her it wasn\u2019t right because she wasn\u2019t finished explaining and telling me how she felt and it was extremely rude and I should\u2019ve kept listening and offered more alternatives instead of saying no. IE. Let\u2019s watch a movie instead etc. \n\nIn the end she just wanted me to ask what else she\u2019d like to eat instead, instead of just saying no. \nThat was it.\nAlso we are now watching a movie she wants to watch and eating a nice home cooked meal. \n\nEdit: more info", "NTA, people always forget what you do for them when they\u2019re upset.", "NTA\n\nYour GF tends to 'my way or the highway' attitude.\n\n>it's always about you, about your decisions\n\nWho is entitled to make decisions about a person's health and body? GF is delusional, and I wonder why you are still together.", "I didn\u2019t want to make the post this long and go this deep into our relationship since the AITA isn\u2019t about this, but if you want more details, yea I have taken her to many places that she\u2019s wanted to go to. We only have time on the weekends since we both work different hours and aren\u2019t week on weekdays. But the week before she asked me to go watch a show that her friend gave her free tickets for, I said sure I can go with you and we did, but she ended up walking out because she disliked the show. After the show she said she was hungry so I asked her what she wanted to eat, she said she didn\u2019t know, I asked if she\u2019d want me to cook for her? She said yeah let\u2019s go home and thanks for cooking. \n\nI do a lot for her actually but within this post I don\u2019t want to put details of our 3 year relationship. Personally I think it\u2019s just that my gf uses these tactics to guilt trip me into feeling bad every time I refuse to do any activity with her. \nBecause I know I\u2019ve done and tried a lot but sometimes I feel like she just uses the negatives to attack me when she\u2019s upset and never thinks about the positives when she\u2019s pissed off.", "Thank you for pointing this out. Yes I admit when I walked away I was very childish, so I was wrong for doing that.", "Honestly this is the best response to our problem instead of the one that received the most votes guilting me into being the problem. \nBut you\u2019re right we talked it out and this was the problem. \nYou hit the nail in the head. \nI explained to her today I just couldn\u2019t because I was in a very depressed moon and she knows I have depression. She understood and also apologized for lashing out at me as well. I also apologized for walking away during an argument.", "Why didn\u2019t you take her to hotpot with you yesterday?", "If the only time she mentions you being selfish or only caring about your needs is when she want's to do something you don't, then you're NTA. This isn't a cut and dry scenario though, would take two peoples accounts of what is happening to fully come to a conclusion here, it's not like \"my dad stole my baby AITA\" type thing.", "I'll be honest, you seem very frustrated with your girlfriend, and exhausted too. Is there a chance that maybe this relationship has run its course?", "Because I believe it\u2019s healthy to say no sometimes.", "Yes literally the only time she\u2019s called me selfish is when I don\u2019t want to do something she wants to do or if I\u2019m not feeling up for it. \nI\u2019ve also noticed less fights if I keep saying yes to what she wants. \n3 weeks ago she wanted to go watch the new marvel movie that came out, I also said yes even though I don\u2019t like marvel movies, and she booked the tickets on the weekday because she didn\u2019t want to watch it on the weekend since there were too many people. I still said yes because I knew it\u2019d make her happy.", "I think you misunderstood slpnrpnzl, they where asking why you didn't take your girlfriend with you to eat hot pot the day before. Because you mentioned, that you ate hotpot a day prior and therefore didn't want to eat it again.", "Saying no for the sake of saying no is just stupid", "Saying no because mentally I can\u2019t handle going out today. \nEveryone needs a mental health day for themselves. \nHave you ever refused to go to a party your friend invited you to because mentally you just can\u2019t handle the crowd that day?", "A SO is not equivalent to a friend, if my SO wanted me to go to a party with them, I would even if I wasn't feeling up to it because I like to support my partner.", "It sounds like you really don't like your girlfriend very much. And that's okay. Relationships run their course, and honestly it sounds like this one has truly run its course. The only thing is that you need to tell her, and break up, instead of dragging this on.", "That\u2019s fine and all but your friend isn\u2019t your girlfriend? Like do you consider your girlfriend your life partner or a friend that you happen to sleep with occasionally?"]}
