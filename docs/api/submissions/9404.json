I'm not crazy, in the summer when it's hot and sticky I shower every 2-3 days like normal but it just doesn't feel necessary in the winter!\n\nAnyway, the inciting incident here was on Sunday. I was ordering more shampoo and commented on how the price had almost doubled since last time. My girlfriend (29F) asked when I last ordered it and it was some time in mid-2020. She was shocked \"how did it take you almost 3 years to go through a bottle of shampoo?\" I told her that I don't use a lot and eventually we got into how frequently I showered and she acted like I was crazy. She didn't even know that I was averaging one shower a week because I keep good hygiene. I groom myself regularly and wear deodorant so I don't think anyone can really tell the difference. Then my girlfriend, we'll call her Granet, starts going on about \"oh that explains the smell\" and stuff like that. I totally think she was just making it up at this point. I've been dating her for 2 years and she's never commented about smell or anything. There's no way she just happened to decide that I smell bad now that she knows my shower schedule. She's just trying to shame me. We argued for a while about it and then she went home.\n\nToday, I saw my mom (56F) for lunch and I told her about it. She agreed with me that it's fine and that she's never thought that I looked greasy or unclean. My mom also said that I should consider showering at least a couple times a week if Granet has a problem with it, but if she can't actually tell the difference why bother? I'm considering trying to say that I'm showering every other day but keeping my normal routine. If she can actually tell the difference she will know but if not then it's just a little white lie. Is this wrong for me to do?\n\nAm I a supervillain just because I'm not following the societal norm? I remember reading that overshowering can cause head lice but no one even talks about that. Reddit, has anyone else been in a similar scenario?\n\nEDIT: Hey everyone, appreciate the comments from people who were kind and tactful in their replies. I've done some research after seeing the overwhelming amount of responses and I am going to start showering more to prevent the buildup of harmful bacteria.
