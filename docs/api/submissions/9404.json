She didn't even know that I was averaging one shower a week because I keep good hygiene. I groom myself regularly and wear deodorant so I don't think anyone can really tell the difference. Then my girlfriend, we'll call her Granet, starts going on about \"oh that explains the smell\" and stuff like that. I totally think she was just making it up at this point. I've been dating her for 2 years and she's never commented about smell or anything. There's no way she just happened to decide that I smell bad now that she knows my shower schedule. She's just trying to shame me. We argued for a while about it and then she went home.\n\nToday, I saw my mom (56F) for lunch and I told her about it. She agreed with me that it's fine and that she's never thought that I looked greasy or unclean. My mom also said that I should consider showering at least a couple times a week if Granet has a problem with it, but if she can't actually tell the difference why bother? I'm considering trying to say that I'm showering every other day but keeping my normal routine. If she can actually tell the difference she will know but if not then it's just a little white lie.
