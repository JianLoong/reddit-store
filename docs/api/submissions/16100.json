I do all med procedures & I homeschool him, raise the babies. I do all cooking/cleaning, I take care of dog, chickens, pig. \n\nHe told me he wants a 'traditional household,' solely dependent on his income. If my son didn't have this med condition, he wouldn't have this $ to lean on and we'd be just on his income. It started with borrowing sometimes, but now it's every month. He takes $3-700 from the only money I receive to pay bills.\n\nI've tried to get him to budget for YEARS but he refuses. I finally got him to do his taxes & catch up this year & he then turns around & says it wouldn't have gotten done if it wasn't for him (which is crazy bc it was my mom and I prodding him for so long). \n\n He has 4 trucks&an older BMW, all of them need work- he spends a lot of $ fixing them or simply buys new trucks. It's hurting us. Ex: he bought a truck recently & after 2 payments it blew up, he still owes about 1500, which is a lot for us at $500/mo. He doesn't work on my car. I have numerous dash lights on, no horn, insurance, registration. (I rarely leave the house, I'm very isolated). The only reason I have my car is bc I had it before we were together. He's also really bad about \"nickle&diming\" sodas, snacks, cigarettes, etc at the gas station.\n\nToday  rent rolls up & SSI comes in the same day as rent, he said he needs 300 to cover the difference. I'm already paying for groceries for a family of 5 this week & I paid my son's homeschool for the month. Once my $ is gone, I'll have none until next month, but he gets weekly payments.\n\n I told him I won't do it & he said \"good luck, I already have your card.\" He took & hid my card from me, I said to give me my card back but I ended up leaving to figure out how to temporarily shut down my card about 20 min later. In that moment he had taken his truck & gone to an atm & pulled 300 out by the time I opened my account. I decided not to close the card, go home & retrieve my card since he got what he needed. He handed it back freely. I went & taped it under furniture, as I did with an abusive ex long ago. It actually made me feel sick to my stomach to do that again after so long. I'm tired of giving him the only money I have when he insists I stay home w no income w the children & that he be the \"sole provider,\" yet be so irresponsible himself.\n\n I'm willing to look at this situation w wide open mind.

He not only controls his money and your ability to seek employment, but now he is also taking any other cash you have including the money meant to provide for your son *who relies on intensive medical support to remain alive.* Babe, fucking run. I don't say that lightly. There is a damn good reason he can steal your son's cash by manipulating you, spend it on his hobby of buying project cars, and leave you with no safe, reliable transportation without stopping to think he might be a giant jackass. Your car is how you would get yourself and your kids to safety and help in an emergency, and he *actively deprioritizes that.* He gaslights you. He deflects. He takes credit for your input, and assigns blame where he owes accountability.\n\nRegardless of whether he loves you or you love him, love does not overcome abuse. Love does not take hostages. Love does not have indentured servants. It's one thing to have a traditional household, but you don't. He wants his money, and also yours, and for you to be the maid and mother of the home. Meanwhile, he isn't providing enough to cover the expenses, demands all of your money to cover his choices, and fails to keep up with the aspects of the household that would have fallen to *him* in a traditional household. Maybe your car should be in working order before he puffs his chest out about traditional roles. He's failing the fuck out of his, while you are busting ass to meet yours.\n\nThere are potential partners out there who want a traditional household setup and will meet their end of the bargain without abusing you and your kids. If you don't leave, at least have a safety plan in place with your mom so that you can respond if and when he escalates. That could look like code words that would let her know to call help, leaving a set of clothing and medical supplies at her house, or even setting up an account in her name that he cannot access at all to stash a little emergency cash in. Whatever you do, don't let him continue to isolate you and leave you with no escape route. The way things are going with your car, that's the path you're on, and it doesn't seem like he is unaware.\n\nGood luck, mama.
