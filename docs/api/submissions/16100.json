He takes $3-700 from the only money I receive to pay bills.\n\nI've tried to get him to budget for YEARS but he refuses. I finally got him to do his taxes & catch up this year & he then turns around & says it wouldn't have gotten done if it wasn't for him (which is crazy bc it was my mom and I prodding him for so long). \n\n He has 4 trucks&an older BMW, all of them need work- he spends a lot of $ fixing them or simply buys new trucks.

He handed it back freely. I went & taped it under furniture, as I did with an abusive ex long ago. It actually made me feel sick to my stomach to do that again after so long. I'm tired of giving him the only money I have when he insists I stay home w no income w the children & that he be the \"sole provider,\" yet be so irresponsible himself.\n\n I'm willing to look at this situation w wide open mind.

He not only controls his money and your ability to seek employment, but now he is also taking any other cash you have including the money meant to provide for your son *who relies on intensive medical support to remain alive.* Babe, fucking run. I don't say that lightly. There is a damn good reason he can steal your son's cash by manipulating you, spend it on his hobby of buying project cars, and leave you with no safe, reliable transportation without stopping to think he might be a giant jackass. Your car is how you would get yourself and your kids to safety and help in an emergency, and he *actively deprioritizes that.* He gaslights you. He deflects. He takes credit for your input, and assigns blame where he owes accountability.\n\nRegardless of whether he loves you or you love him, love does not overcome abuse. Love does not take hostages. Love does not have indentured servants. It's one thing to have a traditional household, but you don't. He wants his money, and also yours, and for you to be the maid and mother of the home. Meanwhile, he isn't providing enough to cover the expenses, demands all of your money to cover his choices, and fails to keep up with the aspects of the household that would have fallen to *him* in a traditional household. Maybe your car should be in working order before he puffs his chest out about traditional roles. He's failing the fuck out of his, while you are busting ass to meet yours.\n\nThere are potential partners out there who want a traditional household setup and will meet their end of the bargain without abusing you and your kids. If you don't leave, at least have a safety plan in place with your mom so that you can respond if and when he escalates. That could look like code words that would let her know to call help, leaving a set of clothing and medical supplies at her house, or even setting up an account in her name that he cannot access at all to stash a little emergency cash in. Whatever you do, don't let him continue to isolate you and leave you with no escape route.

Please get help! He is already stealing from your disable son. Your bf sounds awful in every way.", "YTA for not protecting your kids. This man is STEALING your disabled child\u2019s money. Please do some reflection and get yourself some help to leave this man.", "Honey.... I am so sorry he is doing this to you. This is what is called financial and economic abuse. \n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline\n800-799-7233\nSMS: Text START to 88788", "I mean cmon\u2026\u2026.. The signs can\u2019t be more obvious", "There\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s an AH but it\u2019s crazy that the top advice to a woman with three small children, one of whom is special needs, is a cavalier \u201cleave him now\u201d. How is a woman with no job history or savings supposed to just \u201cleave\u201d. Is the homeless shelter so much better? Who watches the three children, again one of whom is special needs, while this woman works minimum wage? The guy doesn\u2019t have any money so child support is going to be minimal. What you should do OP is save every penny you can and work slowly on saving up enough to leave safely after you\u2019ve arranged child care. Start reaching out to family to see who will allow the four of you to couch surf. If your name is on the house there are much less public support options in place for you (my coworker found this out when she tried to leave her abusive spouse with her three children).", "Not all \u2018traditional households\u2019 qualify as \u2018misogynist\u2019. Or misandrist for that matter. Both of my sets of grandparents had beautiful considerate and loving relationships that lasted until death. My grandmothers were madly in love with their husbands until the end. Both were free to work if they so chose(my nan did during the war), and returned to taking care of the house and raising her children happily when my papa returned at the end. It\u2019s disgusting to automatically assume a traditional household is inherently wrong(for either sex/gender). Not all traditional relationships are the way you view them. I have done it all.. college.. university.. professional career.. small business owner.. and I now have a toddler and am almost at my due date with our second. I went from fiercely independant to relying on my husband to provide. He is far from misogynist despite our now traditional household. Your post is definitely vomit worthy.", "Reminds me of that Blue October song, The Shape of Your Heart: \n\n\"We take the one we think we deserve -\nAnd slowly, try to make it all work\"\n\nWell put. I hope OP finds a way.", "Ah, great, you already posted it. I was about to do the same. \n\nAnyway, NTA, OP's hubby is a control freak & need to be yeeted into the sun (but in a slow, safe, planned manner, as he seems the type to turn violent)"]}
