After  1 year of her addiction started , my parents had enough and they completely cut her out ( and I mean completely), my other 2 siblings followed them shortly. Their decision was  understandable. However , I remained the only active family member in her life. Well to be fair, those years were  difficult for me. I had to bail her out from a lot of shit , paid for her rehab attempts , a lot of stress. But finally she managed to recover and she is now 6 years sober.  She has a job  and her life is stable. Our relationship became really strong. But my parents and other siblings still do not talk to her. Why ? because they do not want to take any risks according to them. They were able to move on with their life and they fear if they let her in again and she relapsed , they would be dragged to the situation all over again. My sister  really misses them and she wants to talk to them again . I tried to convince them to give her another chance, I told them that she is 6 years sober now , she deserves it. But nothing worked.\n\nWell things escalated last week, my sister talked to me and she was crying. She met my mother and my eldest sister at a shop. She tried to greet them. But they just ignored her and moved on. I was angry and confronted them if this was true ( they said yes).  I told them that they are disgusting, she is 6 years sober now.  What more one have to do to get another chance? I am starting to think that this is not related to her past addiction, they just for some reason hate her. They said \" no it's not like that, you have to understand what we suffered through those years \". I told them \" wtf are you even talking about , you completely cut her out from your lives after 1 year , the one who had to deal with her problems 95% of the time in her addiction period was me , get over yourselves already.\" But you have the right to do what you want. I don't agree with what you are doing, so you should also pretend that I don't exist because I will no longer contact you\". They said that this is cruel and unfair.

No one is owed a relationship. For every single reason you wanted to help her, they had to not. For every reason you think they are being ridiculous, they probably think the same of you. \n\nAddiction is awful. I\u2019m happy your sister is sober and hope that she stays sober.", "Having been through it I can honestly tell you that how ever good you intentions are you have no right to tell them how they should feel. The things that are said and done can be disgusting and unforgivable AND none of your business all at the same time. This is between the three of them and the fact she\u2019s crying to you about it is just another way of using.", "Honestly, all you can control is what's within your control. Sometimes recovered addicts have burned too many bridges to be rebuilt. Stop fussing at your family, they've made their decision. You don't have to like it and neither does your sister but they don't want her in their lives. NAH", "I can't say whether you're an AH or not.   As someone who's dealt with this the pain and hurt caused by someone who's an addict is terrible.  Years of lies and theft and using.  It's not an easy thing to forgive.  \nHave they apologized for what they did to the family?   And, other than the addiction, what did they do to the family?   There's a lot more here to unpack.", "ESH- if they dont want someone in their life, that is their choice.  Let your sister lead a happy life without them bringing her down and causing her stress. There isnt anything you can do, this is up to them if they want to try again.  And no, not everyone HAS to give someone who has hurt them a second chance.", "ESH. I think stealing 5k is a pretty big deal for you to just be glossing over. 6 years sober is fantastic, i\u2019m glad she was able to turn her life around. \n\nBut neither you nor her get to dictate how people choose to protect themselves & their mental health. Just because you are choosing to be a part of her life doesn\u2019t mean anyone else has to. Actions have consequences. \n\nHas she apologized for anything she had done?", "NTA. Good on you for hanging in there. I hate seeing posts where someone really works hard but others refuse to see them. I know every situation is different, but after doing a related study...I heard stories that broke my heart. The inner suffering and self-hatred for one.\n\nYou made a great point...they gave up the first year so perhaps consider going low contact. Keep loving the survivor :) Edit: saw that you mentioned that as well, no contact even.", "NTA, they are cruel and unfair. Addiction is hard to get away from, Ive been clean for 2 years now and its a huge struggle to continue. Props to your sister, shes amazing. I bet your family forgets that while 1 year may have been tough, those 5 years to her and you were some of the worst.", "NTA And good for you for sticking up for your sister! She's lucky to have a support like you in her life, and I'm sure she knows it. \ud83d\udc99", "This internet stranger is proud of you!", "NTA, I understand cutting off an addict when their life has been completely overshadowed by their addiction and they are causing troubles and pain. One year seems a little quick to pull the trigger to me though. Did the rest of your family try anything to help her or get through to her, even an intervention? Like I said, I can understand cutting an addict off, but I will never understand not supporting an addict who has decided to try to get sober. I\u2019m so glad you were there and are there for your sister, recovery is hard enough with a fully supportive family, I can\u2019t imagine it with no one.", "To err is human. to forgive divine.\n\nYTA.  You are expecting too much of your parents.  It takes a LOT for a parent to go NC with their child.  Not everything is forgiveable.  You should not be trying to force a reconciliation.  Your sister should be the one begging for forgiveness of whatever it is that they cannot move past (and I highly doubt you even know what that is).", "NTA. I lost my brother to an OD. There were quite a few years including around the time he died where I had very much kept my distance\u2026but to treat her that way in public, and after 6 years. That\u2019s Terrible. Buuuttt a relapse is ALWAYS a possibility when you suffer from addiction, so I also understand their desire to distance themselves\u2026but they also suck", "NTA. I agree it's smart to be cautious around an addict, but 6 years sober is no small feat. I don't know what your sister did in the throes of her active addiction that would make your mom especially turn her back on her completely, but you're perfectly fine to be advocating for her and disappointed in their reaction.", "The number one indicator of success for a recovering addict is if they have good community/family support. It's beautiful that you were that for your sister and still are. Your family is appalling. You are NTA in however you decide to react to how they treat her. Just keep in mind, you gave her 2nd, 3rd, and 4th chances, etc. So you might also want to give your family an opportunity to fix their behavior towards you and her, collectively.", "NTA but each individual decides how and if they want to interact with someone else be it family or not family.  Your sister made her decision when she chose drugs and the rest of the family made their decision because of it.  It\u2019s a hard and cruel reality but at least your sister has you and you have her.  Best not push either side.  It\u2019s not your fight to be in the middle of.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like the rest of your family are cruel and not capable of unconditional love. I truly don\u2019t know how that can be so unfeeling.", "NTA - I am really glad your sister has you, however, I worry for her sobriety if she doesn't get some trauma therapy to properly process the loss of her family, especially her mother and father. It is imperative she accepts and moves on from her family not wanting anything to do with her. She has to accept responsibility for her part in this entire ordeal and focus on the people who do want her. It is ok for people not to forgive her and more than ok for her to move on and be happy. \n\nI wish your sister nothing but the best. I hope she remains sober and eventually makes a family of her own.", "YTA\n\nQuit trying to force this relationship on everyone. It's great that you helped your sibling through all this, but the rest of your family doesn't owe anyone reconciliation or forgiveness. For years they've made their position clear. You don't have to like it, but you need to accept it", "NTA.  Damn that is cold.  They just dropped her like she never existed?  What was the relationship like before her addiction?  I'm sure it was difficult for them to deal with and sometimes the best way to help an addict is to cut them off, so I give them the benefit of the doubt there, but if she has been 6 years sober she must be taking her recovery very seriously.  If you can't give family a second chance then who can you give one to?", "NTA and you\u2019re an amazing brother", "NTA and here's why, 'I will go no contact'  \"That is Cruel and Unfair\" ok so we've Flat Out ACKNOWLEDGED that they view NC as Cruel.  So they KNOW they are being Cruel to your sister, but they don't care.  Even if I dislike a persons siblings, spouse, relatives what have you.  If I CARE about THAT PERSON I actively make an effort to not even be MEAN much less CRUEL to that person because they are special to Someone I Care About.  It's one thing to not want to invite her home, to not want to actively converse, it is a Very Different thing to Actively Pretend you don't know someone when they run into you out and about.  It is publically humiliating them, it is intentional Cruelty.  It would have taken Minimal effort to say \"Hi, I'm glad you're doing well, but we've got to go.\"  or even a simple \"Please let us be, we have nothing to say to you.\"  It'd hurt but at least it'd be an acknowledgement of existance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re parents are heartless, and obviously have no real understanding about the disease of addiction. Did you sister become addicted after being prescribed opiates? Because if so, that makes your parents even shittier people for not being willing to understand how the pharmacy industry was predatory and intentionally overprescribed patients for profit. \n\nYou are a good person. I know it sucked dealing with her bullshit, but you staying probably saved your sister.", "Ah I'm sorry. Having parents who are unloving probably fueled that addiction at one point. Is your sister in NA?", "YTA for trying to force your family to have a relationship with your sister. (Not for having a relationship with her yourself).\n\nYou said  \"She had some screaming and argument with my parents.\" Sometimes things people say during the screaming matches are unforgivable. Some people can only take so much hurt before the bridge gets burned.\n\nMy mom \"only\" texted me that she wish I had died when I was little. While it might not be a lot to some people and a dumb reason to cut someone out, there are other smaller things that add up, and ultimately that was what broke the camel's back. As a result of some things she \"only\" said, I had severe depression, anxiety and anger issues that costed A LOT of money to fix. So yes, your sister might have \"only\" stolen from your family and \"only\" yelled at them, but these the little things add up to a lot of emotional damage.\n\nYou only live a short life and some people don't deserve a spot in your life if they don't add any value to your life. I don't care if they are related to you by blood.", "NTA.  Your parents are heartless.  This isn\u2019t even tough love.  Stay strong for you and your sister.  The only cruelty being done here is to your sister.", "Yeah I've some thoughts but want more INFO", "Saw a comment where OP says the worst thing she did was steal 5k. Bad, but doesn't warrant how cruel her parents are being.", "I agree with this. Op can\u2019t force a decision on them and can\u2019t decide when the right time is to forgive someone. I feel bad for the sober sister and it really sucks that she has no family contact, but OP cannot solve that.", "I already said she tried to apologise and start returning the money. But they don't even want to start a conversation. No stealing 5k is not small , but doesn't warrant this extreme response", "No. That's my whole issue. She started her addiction. She had some screaming and argument with my parents. The worst thing she did is stealing 5k from them. All this during 1 year. After that my family cut her off completely ( like she does not exist). From that point on , I was the one dealing with the situation. She wanted to apologise, tried to start returning the money. But nothing worked.", "Expecting too much ? What ? The worst things that happened during that year is fights with my parents ( shouting, not physical) and her stealing 5k. After that they completely cut her out. In fact , all of her big problems came after that and I was the one who dealt with them. They never once asked me about her situation during the other 4 years. And yet they act like suffered hell on Earth. No that's not too much, that's basic human decency", "Yea I mean everyone like she deserves forgiveness but what if she assaulted her mom or worst a younger family member. Some things can't be forgiven", "I'm wondering if OP actually knows everything that went down. Yeah, the 5k is a big deal, but that level of anger on the family's part tells me there's something else going on.", "NTA\n\nThank you for taking care of your sister. I am proud of her recovery and of you helping her. Your parents and siblings are unkind people. i think you're in the right to tell them you want nothing to do with them if they cut your sister off", "Like I said, I'm happy that you are there for your sister, and you are right to advocate for her and to continue to advocate for her. I don't know anything about your family dynamics, so I don't want to overstep, but as bad as she feels maybe you need to consider if it is in her best interest to reconnect with the rest of your family. Hopefully she is in therapy and is working on the underlying reasons for her addiction, family dynamics can contribute. I also hope that you are getting some help, it is not easy to be the loved one of an addict, and you can be the best support for her when you are at your best. It couldn't hurt to suggest therapy for the rest of your family - the best would be some form of group therapy to work through the issues, but I feel like they probably would not be interested. I would still suggest it though.", "She did apologize and tried to correct her mistakes? Oh OP, Im sorry your parents are like that, thats really sad.", "Everything can be forgiven.", "Nothing other happened.  I already asked several times , if there is something else.  They firmly reject it. That's why I told them , unless they tell me something that requires this extreme response, I consider them cruel and I will remove myself from their life", "That's a very fair point tbh", "Nope, some act, some things, can and should never be forgiven by anything other than a pickaxe to the brainstem.\n\nEvil needs to fought, crushed, and burned. Not forgiven.", "Horseshit.", "You OK bro?", "Yeah, im doing my part :)"]}
