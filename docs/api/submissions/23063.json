I did the same the following year but was so overwhelmed that he decided to stay home as well, sell his house and we live off that money for the year. That was short lived. I was constantly stressed to the max, wondering where money went, hiding money from him for bills, getting overdraft fees in MY bank account cause he would use my debit card like it had no limit. The next year I begged him to stay at home with our baby so I could get a job and send the older 3 back to in person learning. it was amazing to finally be out of the house. The next year our daughter started preschool, I worked and he refused and stayed home. I struggled to provide for 4 kids and a grown up, begging him to get a job, living paycheck to paycheck and barely scraping by. In November I had to have several emergency surgeries, was off work for 3 months and still he did not work. But with me down and out, he had to pay bills with my savings and it went to quickly, mysteriously and I had to get a loan to cover the rest.  FF to now. I have hit my limit. I cut him off financially and told him to get a job and figure out everything himself cause I wasn't funding him anymore. He has been struggling hard core, finding gas money to get to work ect. He finally got a paycheck. I didn't ask for any of it cause I wanted him to learn a lesson on what all I do but I did blatantly tell him about bills and such that was needed but didn't press and he blew the whole thing. He got another and the same thing happened. I was patient. He got his 3rd check and bills HAD TO BE PAID RIGHT NOW, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, NOW! our daughters birthday is next week. What he doesn't know is I already got her everything from us and it's put up. Am I terrible for watching him panic about her birthday to teach him about his spending?\n\nWould also like to add that I'm off for the summer, all the bills are covered until September when I go back to work by my secret savings account.\n\nEDIT. I'm trying to show him that he can not just blow his money and that I also do not want to run the entire household by myself anymore. I want him to share the responsibility with me and take some of my stress.\n\nYes he is a compulsive shopper/alcoholic/fishing addiction. No it doesn't make him look good. \n\nYes I do believe I am mentally unstable to still be with him but I have a compulsion to take care of everyone.

Sorry.  You're doing it by yourself anyway.  This isn't going to change and you are wasting years of your life on this.", "If my husband was ever so irresponsible with money, I would have divorced him after the first year. \n\nESH\n\nWhy he sucks is obvious but you also have responsibilities:\n- you have allowed him to be this way all your married life (or anyway at least the last 5 years)\n- you allow this person being a role model to your kids\n- you expose your kids to whatever tension financial struggles bring to a family \n- you recognise you can no longer treat him as an adult and instead of resolving the situation, you play games to teach him a lesson.\n\nGlad you have secret savings etc but do you really not see how unhealthy the dynamics of your relationship are?", "Why would you stay with this man if he can't be financially responsible?  You're having to parent your children and him!\n\nNTA", "NTA but you cannot live like this - like you actually need to see a divorce lawyer.", "INFO - Why the fuck are you still married to this guy?", "I think you might be asking the wrong question. This sounds like a really toxic and financially abusive relationship. If you feel the need (whether real or perceived) to keep secret saving accounts from your husband and lie to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d I\u2019d suggest digging deep to determine whether this relationship is worthwhile to stay in. From the details you\u2019ve shared it sounds like a nightmare.", "Is your husband a gambler? If hes ploughing through money like you say, it sounds like something else is going on. \n\nThis is not good for you or the children.\n\nAlso, no you are NTA with the birthday thing.", "Mom?!", "NTA, your husband is incompetent", "NTA but his spending habits are absolutely out of control. You\u2019ve been drained dry on both your checking AND savings account, and every time he gets money it\u2019s gone. \n\n\nThis person either has zero financial knowledge/responsibility or a crippling addition that he\u2019s hiding. Whether it be alcohol, drugs, or loss porn over in WSB, he is forty years old and it\u2019s too late for him to change. \n\n\nThe help he needs cannot and will not come from you. Good on you for actually coming through for your daughter, but this man is a leech. You being in a better position 8 years younger should tell you everything you need to know. Please find a way to stop and end this madness.", "NTA but this isn\u2019t going to just go away. He is too old to learn better habits and he will never be responsible with his money. Let him panic right up until the moment you hand the gifts over; and learn from it yourself when he shows you that he would rather have his kid be heartbroken on her birthday than solve his own problems with money.\n\nI doubt this is fixable. You can try, but don\u2019t keep giving him chance after chance - if he\u2019s going down the financial drain there is little you can do to stop him taking the entire family with him unless you step back and reevaluate your life with him.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to have secret savings that you need for everyday expenses.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to do all the work of earning the money and then double that up by managing the entire household as well.\n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t, after all this time, still be mystified as to what this money is going on.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of options but most of them are very not good. He could have another family somewhere that you\u2019re unaware of, or be in debt to someone he shouldn\u2019t be; but the most likely reason is that he has a gambling or other addiction - and the fact that he\u2019s hiding from you, he\u2019s quite happy to spend your money as easily as his own, prioritises his spending away from the family, and you are having to pick up the pieces means that whatever\u2019s going on here, you will pay the price for it with your future.\n\nThink to yourself: do you want to have to work until you die because he has no savings or pension to feed himself or keep a roof over your head when you\u2019re older?", "YTA - as a responsible parent it\u2019s your job to find out what he\u2019s doing with the money and then acting on how to keep your kids safe. \n\nIs it drugs?

Reverse Uno a secret savings account? \n\nAgain, It\u2019s your JOB to find out what he\u2019s up to and then keep you and your children safe from it.", "Are you terrible for watching him panic?! Seriously!! You are talking about 42 year old MAN who quit his job, sold his house and decided to live off that money for a year?! What was the thought process behind that?!\nYou really need to reevaluate your relationship, you are essentially taking care of 5 kids yet you feel bad for making him panic! Wow \nI want to say NTA but honestly ESH because you are to the point of hiding money! Is he gambling what is he spending his money on?", "No you have to get him under control or he will send you into bankruptcy. If he can\u2019t manage money better than a teenager he needs to be treated like a kid with his allowance. Not sure why he won\u2019t work but glad you put your foot down and make him pay the bills why you save back up some money. It\u2019s ridiculous how people can\u2019t manage money", "NTA. Girl, ***you deserve better!*** This has been an ongoing problem and stressor for years and years. I mean this in the kindest way possible, but do you really think he's going to change now? After so long? The lesson that is going to teach him to be responsible with his money is when you kick him to the curb and he learns what it's like to live on his own with no support from others.", "Your husband seems to have a lot of ongoing spending problems with repeated consequences. INFO: Can you share where his money is going?\n\nIt\u2019s not normal for a person to ignore the consequences to this degree without changing their habits. Which leads me to believe he has an addiction (possibly gambling, compulsive shopping, or a substance abuse problem). There are 12 step programs for all of those issues (gambler\u2019s anonymous, debtor\u2019s anonymous, AA, narcotics anonymous) But your husband has to WANT the help.\n\nIn the meantime, see if you can gain control of all the finances. Give him a reasonable allowance. \n\nAnd nooooooo you are so not the AH. The sooner he learns his lesson, the better for everyone.", "NTA\n\nWhere exactly is all his money going? What is he constantly spending it on? Is he a gambler? Alcohol or drugs? or is he just an \"ooo I need this\" type of person who sees new shoes, jacket, phone, etc and has no impulse control and just buys it?  Any of it I would say could use some therapy to solve the issue if there is one.   He is still an ah though. How can you see the person you love not able to work after surgery and and step up?  Not a very good partner.\n\n  You suck for staying with this person for years and having more kids with him. Is barely scraping by what you want for your kids lives? Why stay with someone who you have to keep a secret savings account from just to make sure the bills get paid. \n\nAs for the birthday thing and the NTA ruling- sounds like hes experiencing what i'm sure you've experienced several times before, except you've backed it up so it doesnt actually happen.", "How is it these dead beats always manage to procreate? Get rid of this guy! Your life and finances are going to get worse. Y-T-A to yourself and kids for staying with him. NTA for hiding funds in order to pay bills.", "I dont like how harsh everyone is being, since these situations can be difficult to get out of when it's someone you love/family. It's not good that this is happening, but maybe having a conversation with him about why/how you went about this would help him understand. Idk, good luck though", "Given the background NTA. \n\nHowever going forward now you need a new plan because he will just assume you are taking care of it. You just enabled him a bit more. \n\nIf he has an addictive personality he will not change until he is ready to or has something to lose that is very important to him. \n\nIF you tend to like the savior role then, you take over the bills and budget and he gets an allowance with no access to your accounts period. \n\nNot quite as bad, but my ex was horrible with money and budgets too, when we started getting calls from the mortgage company I put my foot down, took over and allowances were put in place. I didn't have to set up my own accounts, and most spending was transparent, big stuff talked about. So not nearly as crazy as this. \n\nYour husband needs counseling, money isn't going to fix his issues, he needs to figure out what the underlying issues really are and different ways to cope with them. You also need to assess how you enable his behavior. My guess is you need to be more firm on your boundaries. But I'm not a professional. So counseling may be good for you as well.", "This sub is making me appreciate and miss my dad more and more every single day.\n\nI can't believe there are 'dads' out there like this.\n\nNTA, you sound like a good person in a bad situation", "ESN, him for obvious reasons and you for staying with this person you clearly resent. Your kids live in an unstable household, you hide money and play mental games to try and teach him a lesson. He won't learn. It's pointless. He will never, ever manage his finances.\n\nGet your kids away from this person.", "YTA. This won't \"teach\" him anything. He has some severe issues. Counseling might help.  His check should be direct deposited, and he should not have free access. This is crazy. Good luck OP.", "ESH. He should be more financially responsible. You shouldn\u2019t play mind games.\n\nAlso, why are you even still with the person if he\u2019s so irresponsible and unsupportive?\n\nWhere is the money going? I understand he spends it, but on what? What are on his statements?", "YTA if you really think this guy is gonna panic and learn a lesson about fiscal responsibility if you let him think his daughter isn\u2019t getting a birthday present.", "ESH", "Wow. NTA, but this really has nothing to do with birthday savings.  It has everything to do with your entire life's security and your husband's untrustworthiness.\n\n You have done an admirable job of trying to save funds and keep things going under nightmarish circumstances but this cannot last.  At the minimum you and your husband need to enter into financial counseling immediately.\n\nAnd get a lawyer. Were it me I would be getting a divorce or a legal separation, but at the very least you should be establishing separate finances by whatever legal means available.  Take care of your family and your future. This is crazy.", "YTA for staying with a man like this, having children with a man like this, and letting him treat your children like this.", "NTA. But YTA for not cutting him off or limiting his access to the bank. His check should go into a direct deposit account that he has no access to9. He can have a debit card but you give him a weekly allowance. For years my husband had no access to the savings account, only me.", "YTA. It's not your job to parent him or to \"teach him a lesson\".

It\u2019s not quite so bad if the daughter does have presents waiting, but she\u2019s still using her child as a tool to change him through guilt.\n\nI mean, I kinda get it. She\u2019s desperate. But something about that kid being now put squarely in the center feels wrong. And what if they have a massive fight over this and get divorced? The daughter will absolutely see that as her fault because that\u2019s what kids do.", "I honestly don't know anymore.", "I was going to say the same thing. He could be either a gambler or a compulsive shopper. Something\u2019s not adding up.", "Compulsive shopper/alcoholic.", "...CC?", "Is this a role play", "The poo part is, I DO know where the money goes. It goes to small purchases (alcohol, gas, a new drill, fishing addiction) but small purchases add up and (to me) he doesn't understand that. I'm sure he does but it's a matter of caring. I need him to want to care.", "I cant even imagine how messed up those kids are going to be growing up watching this dynamic. OP is def the TA for having kids with this bum even after she knew how crappy she saw he was.", "Compulsive shopper/alcoholic", "This is a last ditch effort to open his eyes. If it doesn't work I am already planning to leave him. I know I'm being stupid but I just love him and do want to spend our lives together. He just needs to pull his head out of his butt and step up. If this doesn't work then I'm done.", "I'd suggest (if OP is going to continue managing this) that all incoming money goes into an account under her control and not usable by him, and then she transfers a set amount of allowance to him that he can see/use out of each. A second account with it's own debit card or such; absolutely cut him off from the main account though.", "Agreed. Especially after learning he\u2019s an alcoholic (who apparently drives!?) and she stays with him because she mentally needs to play the martyr!? Those poor kids!! Hopefully they get some kind of stability in school!?", "A few over the years but it normally leads to an argument. This is a last ditch effort before divorce.", "This is exactly what I was trying to say but couldn't find the words to express! I'm not trying to be mean but I don't think he is going to change until it truly hits him where it hurts and he does love our baby girl (more than the other kids if I'm honest). I'm hoping this will open his eyes and he will \"see the errors of his ways?\" Otherwise I'm done.", "Also what is he gonna do if u stay with him and do cut him off, is he gonna steal from the kids? Max their cards where they get one, how many parents have stolen from their children, it happens pls LEAVE.", "It absolutely is. This isn\u2019t going to solve her problems, and she\u2019s being an asshole to herself and her children by remaining with this guy. She holds all the power because he basically contributes nothing, and she\u2019s just playing a petty trick instead of telling him to man the fuck up or get out?", "I understand that part.  Blended families of all shapes exist all over and when they work they're beautiful... but this ain't it!", "Is this man the role model you want for your kids? Do you want your kids thinking that this is how marriages work? Do you want them to have to go without because your husband has no impulse control and no idea about financial responsibility? \n\nRelationships have a foundation of love, respect, loyalty, honesty, friendship, and acceptance. Let's look at your marriage to see how its foundations are looking. \n\n1.) Love. Maybe there's love, but it isn't being expressed, it seems like. Your husband is so busy spending money on himself, when has he taken the time to show he loves you? When did he last make you feel special? And moreover, do you love him and are you in love with him, or are you just determined to try and fix him?\n\n2.) Respect. Does he respect you when he doesn't even seem to realise all that you do? More importantly, do you respect him given all he's done? \n\n3.) Loyalty. Is he showing loyalty to your family when he's constantly choosing himself? Is your loyalty crumbling because you can't take more of this?\n\n4.) Honesty. Is he being honest about where his money is going? Are you being honest with how you feel? Are you being honest with yourself about this marriage and its prospects?\n\n5.) Friendship. If you had a friend treating you like this, would you keep them around? Is he being a friend to you when he's leaving you to struggle? Are you being a friend to him when you're keeping information from him to watch him flail?\n\n6.) Acceptance. Are you willing to accept this is who he is and that he will likely not change? Are you willing to accept this for the rest of your life? \n\nIf you don't have all those things, what kind of marriage do you have? What is your marriage built on? What is keeping it going, and, most importantly, why are you keeping it going?", "Habit, maybe. You're used to it and different can seem scary.\n\nBut maybe different had the potential to be better? Like not being tied to someone who spends every cent you earn, you could have financial security (or at least not financial terror!).", "Yes, I think there is definitely something going on here", "Your husband sounds super", "If he\u2019s drinking and compulsive shopping, the best thing you can do is get out. Alcoholics won\u2019t change until they hit their bottom. You can think of it as staying there is robbing him of his bottom. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s scary. But you\u2019re allowed to put you and your kids first.\ud83d\udc97\ud83e\udd17", "Uh yeah... ?", "Yeah, but\u2026he\u2019s already proven he doesn\u2019t. Put the kids first and get out.", "I hope you\u2019re right\u2026 but you better make damn sure you account down to the penny. And all the stuff you mentioned? Take it in for a refund.\n\nYou\u2019re enabling him", "You deserve better!! You have stepped up not only for you daughter but for his kids!\nMaybe he can give your his checks, and you guys can workout an allowance for himself. It\u2019s not fair that all bills are left up to you.", "Most dudes WANT to be the bread winner. WANT to provide. WANT to make effort. This dudes never gonna change and him being almost a decade older than you should\u2019ve been an indication he\u2019s never going to magically grow up. I\u2019d move forward with the divorce. This is crazy. Everything you wrote and say in the comments like\u2026. It\u2019s hard to believe this is a real post. And if your kid was really one of the people here commenting they\u2019ve been begging you to leave this guy for years like fucking listen. Not sure wtf you\u2019re waiting for. This dude couldn\u2019t care less.", "Excellent idea.", "Could be he's an extremely funny, lovable person who is a great parent and plays with his kids? Just also very bad with money. Don't know, it's not said, but the tone of OP seems to indicate they really like the guy \"except for this one thing...\"", "I am very much so used to it. And I do think it's more that I'm afraid. Not of being alone but of the change. That feels right I guess I just didn't think of that. You all are giving me so much to think about. Different perspectives I guess.", "Come here please. We need to talk.", "Wait y\u2019all know each other for real?", "That's kind of my goal with this. Not so much give me all the money, more take an active role in our finances and communication. Otherwise I'm leaving him.", "The except for this one thing is dragging their whole family down. We can agree to disagree but when a person\u2019s fault becomes everyone else\u2019s problem, you don\u2019t just stick your head in the sand\u2014 you have to actually address it and take action. What OP is doing is not that.", "Change is scary, but it can also be a wonderful thing. You can do it. You\u2019ve got this!! Do what is best for you and your children. ETA: your daughter even thinks you should leave. I felt bad when I saw what name she goes by on here.", "Ok mum", "Yeah she's my mom...?", "FAKE. Is it Mom or Mum? You british or not? And if it isnt fake I promise the kid isnt surprised and is probably very relieved Mom is getting wise.", "Not exactly the way I wanted my child to find out I was thinking of leaving their father but I forgot she has reddit so that's on me.", "Yes please leave him I've been telling you to for 8 YEARS!!!!", "Get off here for now and go tend to her. You can come back later.", "Yikes\u2026"]}
