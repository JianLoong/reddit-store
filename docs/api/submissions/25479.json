It is not in the greatest area of town, but overall it\u2019s usually fairly safe and cops deal with things here quickly and efficiently. About 6 months ago, a few people moved into one of the very front buildings of the complex and have seemed to be overall nice and quiet people. I believe there are 2 men living there and possibly a woman, but I do not see her very often so unsure. I and everyone else in the complex (we tend to all be neighborly and talk often) have never had any issues with these people, until a few weeks ago. One of the guys in his late 30s-early 40s has been going outside every single morning at 7am and SCREAMING nonsense while walking around the entire complex. He most often does this underneath my window (Im on second floor, very back building) and it has been waking me up every. single. morning. I have opened my window many times and told him to be quiet, which does nothing. I\u2019ve gone out there and told him to be quiet, and he just walks away and continues. This typically goes on until 8AM, and would continue again later on in the afternoon. I work nights, so it is a huge huge huge issue that he is doing this every day. I have been missing work, late for work, and getting like 2 hours of sleep. Well, the other day he was out there screaming for 8 freaking hours and I finally called the police and went back to bed before work. Didn\u2019t see him again before work, but the next morning he was at it again. I called the police again, but he was out there screaming bloody murder within the next hour. Again, the next day it happens and I called the police again and asked them to please do something about this as there are many people here who work nights and lots of small children who should not have to deal with his behavior as they are walking to school in the mornings (the school is across the street). This was last week, and every single day since he has continued to scream and yell and run around for hours on end and it\u2019s getting worse every day. I seriously don\u2019t know what else to do except call the police on him, but obviously it\u2019s not working. AITA for calling the police in the first place? WIBTA for continuing to call the police??? \n\n\n\nI want to add, I have always understood that he may be having a mental health crisis. I also suffer from schizophrenia, so I get it that sometimes shit gets hard. I have always told the police that he is not dangerous but obviously needs help. But I have no idea if this is mental illness or drugs, as many many many people around here behave like that when they start using and it goes downhill. I have also told the police I really am not trying to be a baby about this but even my girlfriend can hear him clear as day screaming outside my apartment when we are on the phone. So yes, it is extremely loud and ridiculous.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: I talked to some of my neighbors again & finally got ahold of our complex manager (she is notorious for being impossible to reach). She confirmed that he does have mental health issues and multiple people have been contacting her about this lately. She said she will talk to him as well as the people that live with him and advised me to continue calling the police if it continues. I found resources for him that I am going to contact if he does it again because I really do not want to keep calling the police", "created_utc": 1692961412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160w1aw/aita_for_calling_police_on_my_neighbor_3_days_in/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In turn making him have multiple psychotic breaks from the anxiety and inability to clearly understand and follow directions.... \n\nAlso hes probably on drugs\ud83d\udc40", "I would also call the apartment managers.   They should be dealing with this.", "Thanks! I have been recording it lately, but I will call the apartment manager on Monday", "Most of the time I have 0 clue what he is screaming about, it\u2019s often extremely slurred. But when I have understood it, it\u2019s random stuff like cussing, or literally just words strewn together in an incoherent sentence", "that is if the police didn't beat the shit out of him, taze him 34783483497234 times, and kill him beforehand. which they're known to do to mentally ill people at higher rates than they do to the rest of the population.", "I disagree. If this is mental health/psychosis, you certainly won't 'cure' it that way. His behaviour is uncontrollable if he does have a psychotic illness - no matter the consequences. And if it's drugs, he'll probably forget what happened. \n\nOr he'll just carry on regardless, next time his trip causes these impulses (which are hard to resist, given the impact of serious drugs on the mind. No, he shouldn't be on drugs. But your 'solution' would rarely 'cure' an addiction, either). The only way your 'solution' potentially 'works', is for people who are lucid and acting up. They can understand the link between their behaviour, and the 'solution' you suggest. \n\nIt's hard to see what OP can do. He/she could probably call mental health services for advice. They might get involved, especially if this guy is already known to them. Or try asking the cops, if they'll put him on a mental health hold. OP should film it, so there's strong evidence. Maybe even speak to the other people he lives with, if OP feels that's safe to do? It's a really difficult one.", "don't be coy, we all know you're talking about advocating violence toward someone.", "When I have this type of issue, I always let the property management comp know I contacted the police.  Do both.  If the police are enough to scare him to keep quiet, perhaps the threat of an eviction might be.\n\nTalk to your neighbors.  Multiple complaints work better than just one person.", "Ok? Well since he came out the next day and continued I think we can safely assume the police didn\u2019t intervene.", "What is the result of you reporting this to the police? Have they come out to speak to the screaming guy?", "No I don\u2019t catch your drift. I\u2019m not going to be physically violent with someone who obviously needs help & has never been physically violent.", "The apartment manager should have been the first person you contacted. The police are notoriously bad (at worst dangerous) at dealing with mental health issues.", "Apt manager is never at the phone or on site & the police here have always handled mental health cases very graciously and respectfully towards the person. As I said, I have always told them that he is not dangerous just needs some help. Many people here have mental health issues, myself included, and the cops here have always been non-violent towards everyone. They\u2019re trained for this stuff where I\u2019m from", "Does your area have a mobile crisis unit? Police are rarely adequately trained to deal with people in mental health crises, but more and more areas are establishing teams of first responders specifically trained to aid in such circumstances. \n\nUnfortunately, calling the cops on someone during a mental health break can leave them dead. And since you already have and it isn\u2019t working, yes, YWBTA if you continued calling the police. But it does seem this person needs help beyond what a landlord can do, too, so reach out to local resources that aren\u2019t law enforcement. Reframe your question as \u201chow do I get this to stop\u201d to \u201chow do I help them\u201d and you won\u2019t have to question if you\u2019re TA.", "Are you in the US? If so, call up your county social services and request a wellness check, explain everything and play recordings. They can get him help", "I\u2019m in USA, I\u2019m not too sure on what all resources are available to call for mental health except for the police as they handle it in my city a lot", "Yeah I saw them out here twice, the other time I went back to sleep. I keep my distance and did not want to get involved (prefer to stay anon when calling them anyways) so I do not know what all was said to him", "I have been researching resources for him all day and just found that we do have something similar to a crisis unit, I do not want to keep calling the cops on him especially since my landlord confirmed he has mental health issues. Nowhere in my post did I ask how to get him to stop and I also stated in the post that I know he needs help.", "You\u2019re probably going to have to coalition with your neighbors. My old apartment had mostly old people and if you ever need a group that has free time and complaint power, it\u2019s old people. I never had to do much because there was always a flock or flurry of calls to our police, building manager, electric company, etc.\n\nOne person can be ignored. Get everyone you can to call in, email in, sit in their office, etc. Call the after hours guy, call the owner, call the newspaper. And if you can\u2019t do that, get a bunch of different email addresses, change up the wording, and bombard the fuck out of their emails."]}
