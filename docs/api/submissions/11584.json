It's the first time in a few days that I'd played games for more than like an hour maybe for 3-4 days. \n\nShe texted me later in the night and said that if I didn't want this to work then don't waste her time. I didn't respond because I didn't know how to respond. Later the next day, I tried to explain that I just wanted some alone time and she said I get alone time during our kid's(2.5) naps. \n\nI want to be better but I also want to play my games, I understand her point that I have time while our kid naps but usually during that time I'm busy doing other things like taking a shower, tidying up the house, or running errands. So in my head I'm justified in taking 2-3 nights out of the week to myself and doing something I enjoy. \n\nIn my head I try to balance out spending time with her and playing games, I usually stay until like 9:30-10 on nights I'm doing raids and I just stay upstairs the other nights. \n\nShe told me I'm mean to her because of these actions and how I don't consider her when doing these things. But while I am playing games still, I am considering her.

I\u2019m married, over 25 years now. I\u2019ve been online gaming in open world and the like for nearly thirty years now - since before they had graphics and were MUD\u2019s with walls of texts.\n\nIf your wife is getting this angry, and it is clear this isn\u2019t a one off from how you describe her comments, then you haven\u2019t balanced it right my friend. So, first point, let\u2019s just be real a sec here\u2026. Raiding > a happy wife? Stop and think on priorities. Raiding > intimacy? Check your priorities, for real. Raiding > stable home life?

We didn\u2019t have kids yet, though. \n\nWeekly? With kids? Time to hang up the meta cleats, man, you are choosing gaming over your marriage and family. Do you **REALLY** value legacy and meta status in a game more than your marriage? \n\nYTA", "YTA. You have a toddler, you're not going to get 2-3 nights a week to yourself. Pick one predictable night per week to play games, and give your wife one night per week to do something for herself while you do all the child care. If you can, get a babysitter and make one night per week date night. Checking out for several hours two or three nights a week isn't good for your marriage.", "Dude. She told you that she is considering ending your marriage and you flat out ignored her so you could keep playing video games.\n\nAnd you\u2019re honestly confused about whether you\u2019re the asshole here?\n\nYTA. \n\nOf course it\u2019s reasonable to want some time alone with a hobby, but not at the specific moment your wife is trying to talk with you about how desperately unhappy she is in your marriage.", "YTA - you can find justification anywhere for your actions, including here on reddit, but you're failing to look at the bigger picture.\n\nYour wife, the mother of your children, the other adult in your family unit - is giving you some pretty strong cues that she's not happy with current arrangement.  When she says, \"**If you don't want this to work, than don't waste her time**\"?  That is the voice of a woman who is at the end of her rope.\n\nShe's thinking of parting ways with you.  She's thinking your wasting her time.  Instead of justifying this - listen to what she is saying.  She's nearly done with you and whatever you are doing or not doing.    \n\n\nSo you can justify your actions and carry on.  Sounds like your marriage will end eventually if this is the route you go.

Either way, if you\u2019re a serious gamer you\u2019re probably part of a guild which has scheduled raid days/times. My husband has scheduled raid twice per week, times I can expect that he will gaming from 9pm-1am, this is something we discussed as a couple and agreed upon. Sometimes he raids other times but he always checks with me to see if I need him for something else or if I\u2019m just okay with it because he knows I want to spend time with him. Now that we have an infant, the only change we made to that agreement is that he will always check with me on the day of raid to make sure I\u2019m okay with being on baby duty during that time because maybe I\u2019m just tired or am just not up to it and need him to skip raid that day. During their scheduled break, he always checks on me. He has also explained to his guild that sometimes he will have to drop what he\u2019s doing to help me, but that\u2019s it\u2019s always when necessary because I know his gaming affects the rest of the guild. It\u2019s okay for you to game but you and your wife need to be on the same page and have an established plan.

But we also need hang out time together to strengthen our relationship. So what works for us is simple. A schedule. Certain evenings are  for alone time and others are couple time. Kids nap times are for being as quiet as possible so they don\u2019t wake early. Perhaps your wife needs less alone time than you do, so a compromise will need to be reached.", "YTA, if she\u2019s not getting equal me time, it\u2019s keeping you from giving 50/50 or there isn\u2019t time prioritized to be an actual couple. Yes you get to decide how to spend your free time and alone time is important but really consider how much time is spent where and compared to her schedule especially. If you stay up late does that mean she doesn\u2019t get time with you or help in the morning? Do you start it before the kids are in bed and chores are done for the night? Do you get loud? Do you do it on a schedule or communicate in advance so she\u2019s not getting disappointed thinking about time with you just for you to disappear for hours?", "Yta why not just break up with your wife because you're obviously more interested in playing games than actually spending time with her.

If your partner is at the point of bringing up whether \u201cthis will work,\u201d I recommend a couples therapist.

Maybe you undervalue her, maybe you're not compatible, or maybe you're just a bit lost in maze of parenthood and the games are comforting. She probably needs the adult company like you need the games. I don't think it's ideal for you to be spending so much time separately from her dealing with this something you share iykwim, much better if you share the comfort when you have a little person already drawing attention away from each-other. I don't know if she'd be into gaming though! Her speaking this way means she feels there's more distance between you and is worried you're moving too much apart.
