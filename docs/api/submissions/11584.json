Sometimes he raids other times but he always checks with me to see if I need him for something else or if I\u2019m just okay with it because he knows I want to spend time with him.

During their scheduled break, he always checks on me.

I don't think it's ideal for you to be spending so much time separately from her dealing with this something you share iykwim, much better if you share the comfort when you have a little person already drawing attention away from each-other.

Then suddenly shocked when the women say ok I\u2019m out.", "Ummmm dude, you're a husband and a father you know?  You might want to invest some time in the life you agreed to by getting married and having kids.  YTA", "YTA you're a grown ass man getting frustrated because you don't get to play with your toys as much as you want too... welcome to adulthood... welcome to fatherhood.. you have a child for gosh sakes... grow up... your poor wife have two kids you being one of them..", "YTA \n\nMarriages are supposed to be give and take.  Your wife will only take so much of the crap you give her.  While it is essential for everyone to have \u201cme\u201d time, when you are in a relationship with a child, your \u201cme\u201d time gets pushed back, a lot (or it\u2019s supposed to anyway).\n\nI take it you are the stay at home parent.  This means your wife brings home the paycheck.  When she finds out you creep on strangers\u2019 breasts, if she hasn\u2019t already, she will have no problems divorcing you, getting custody of the kid and making a living.  She may even save some money because she won\u2019t be paying for your gaming add ons.", "NEI there\u2019s more going on here than just you staying up till 1 am playing video games. I think part of the problem your wife is having with you is that you don\u2019t see anything else she might be upset with. Idk if you are a stay at home dad, work from home, what she\u2019s doing etc. which are all important pieces of info for a ruling here.", "Ya I\u2019m thing YTA now.", "YTA.....Even though you already know it, I'll say it again. Gaming is not the ONLY issue....stop rating boobs and spend that time with your wife and kid. \u270c", "INFO:  Hmmm does SHE get to go out 2-3 nights a week??", "Oh, your the AH my friend and no amount of justification is going to change that.", "INFO: does SHE ever get \u201calone time\u201d to do things she wants to do?", "INFO: does she get any time to herself that in a similar way do not involve things she needs to do like work, childcare, chores, basic life things like sleeping/eating/bathing etc.? Does SHE get justified time to enjoy things 3-4 times a week?", "This man is well on his way to earning some new loot: an efficiency apartment with a secondhand futon and a folding table that his gaming set up sits on that is also where he eats his dinner alone.", "People have made some excellent points here. All I\u2019m going to add is that it seems several days of the week you play games for longer than several hours, and the other days you play for an hour. How many people with young children do you know that engage in one hobby for about 9+ hours a week? In my experience most people with toddlers don\u2019t even have that many hours of free time, and then they divide them between spending quality time with their significant other and a multitude of hobbies that challenges their mind and body (gym/running/outdoor, plus things like games and crafts).", "Your wife is TELLING you that your marriage is breaking right now, and if you continue to choose your friends/hobby over her, it will (pro: you will be able to raid as much as you want if that is your priority). \n\nSince you mentioned doing the math in your post, I'm a former hard core raider myself. I understand the time commitment thay goes in to it - prepping consumables, grinding for gear/buffs, researching fights pre-raid, parsing data post raid to figure out what can be improved. Plus the 6-8 hours of actual  raiding, you are probably spending upwards of 10-15 hours minimum on your hobby. It's not uncommon for some raiders to spend 20+ hours.\n\nAlso, raids can be an intense focus sink. There's no way you can pay attention to anything other than mechanics and your rotations during large chunks of them, and you can't tell your party \"afk for 30 min, baby is crying.\" or \"BRB, time to enjoy a beer and show with my wife.\" Considering most raids are 2-3 nights a week MINIMUM, and most often on nights that are convenient (aka, nights that would also be more convenient for you and your wife to engage in meaningful activities together), they are probably taking more focus from your wife than you think.\n\nPerhaps you may need to find a solution - raiding may not be in the cards right now, but a stopgap like a single player game such as Assassins Creed, Farcry, Battlefront, or an Elder Scrolls may last a bit. Or if MMOs are needed, maybe something social with less maintenance like a CoD/LoL/the Blizzard version of LoL/Valorant where you can play for 30 min, then fold in family.  Your gamer buds will understand, heck, maybe join you, and I bet they'll welcome you back in to raiding at a later date.", "YTA. Ugh", "Yeah.... My fiance is a big time gamer, I'm a casual gamer, but we always prioritize each other. Some nights it is fine he stays up late and games by himself or with friends. But if it started to get between us and our intimacy? Or our \"hang out on the couch\" time together... That would be a full stop. I can't imagine getting to the point OP is at. He needs to pull his head out of his butt.", "I miss zork .", "Literally this. I was a every night raiding kinda person before kids. Haven't been back in like almost 2 years cause toddler wants her mama all the time.  I play single player for now and keep tabs on the changes until I can get back into the groove again. \n\nOP about to lose it all.", "... and by text, too. From inside the hose they share.", "Especially 3x/wk. That's, like, every other day he is utterly unavailable to his partner and his kid. OP needs to grow up.", "Didn\u2019t people call it EverCrack because it was so addictive?", "He's a nasty piece of work", "Did not know that. I was just basing it off his post here. So ya. Maybe the wife is feeling neglected for a lot of reasons and OP needs to really set the games and internet aside and focus on his relationship if he wants it to work", "I\u2019m not a gamer. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation and communication helped a lot. I assume OP needs his alone time and maybe his wife needs less alone time. He shouldn\u2019t have ignored her text that\u2019s for sure.", "Sorry, because you have a gamer *husband*. But why do you assume she needs less alone time when she\u2019s ready to divorce over this? Yeesh.", "I bet video games is what he tells her that he\u2019s up until 1am doing\u2026 in reality it\u2019s looking at and rating girls boobs"]}
