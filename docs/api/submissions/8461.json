That\u2019s not your responsibility.  No matter what you do for tour sister, paying for someone\u2019s babysitter isn\u2019t on you.  What parent asks that???\n\n-  Why is your money going to \u201cfood, furniture, and repairs\u201d?  You\u2019re a minor.  Your parents should be covering all of that, are they not?\n\n-  You\u2019re taking about putting money into step-sister\u2019s college savings and you didn\u2019t have a choice?

Is there an adult you trust that you can talk to about all of this?", "NTA. You are in no way or form responsible for your stepsister. Not even her college fund.

You should be getting ALL of your money and should not have to contribute to childcare. \n\nYou're 14 ffs", "NTA. I can't imagine why your father expects you, a child, to pay his family's routine expenses, like childcare. That's not remotely your responsibility.\n\nYou are not obligated to pay for your siblings, step or otherwise. It is very generous of you to pay expenses for your younger sister, but you are not even obliged to do that, let alone pay childcare expenses for your step-sister that you barely know.\n\nI am honestly shocked that your father would even suggest this.

WTF?  You're being so taken advantage of and they're happy to do it because you're not even aware of how wrong that all is.\n\nIf you OFFER to pay for something, that's one thing.  They're already taking half your paycheck, they need to stop asking you for more. \n\nThe adults in your story are the BIG BIG AHs.", "NTA, I am unsure why you are giving your dad and step mother half of your wages, or why you're somehow expected to pay in for your stepsister's college savings account either. As a third party, this sounds incredibly inappropriate. I don't have much information here, but it doesn't sound like your dad has really turned over a new leaf.", "NTA at all. As your parents they are supposed to take care of you and pay for your hospital bills. You should not be asked to pay for a babysitter for your stepsister. They need to find care arrangements. They were able to manage care for your stepsister before you got your job. This is not your responsibility at all.\n\nWho is taking half your wages? Your father? What is he spending it on?

You are already taking more financial responsibility for your family than a minor should. Please please please do not let them convince you that you are selfish for having boundaries, or wanting to use your own money for yourself.

You\u2019re a minor - part of getting a job is to spend your money irresponsibly. I can understand them taking half your pay if they were putting it into an account for you - sort of like a forced savings.

They are supposed to pay for all your needs and their other kid's needs, not make you pay for them.  And the hospital bills! They are not yours to pay!! That's your parents debt, not yours, because you were a minor!   If you are spending the money you make it should be for extras like your own skating lessons, your own movie ticket, treats, etc.  Clothes, shoes, medical, school supplies, furniture, food, utilities are your parents responsibility until you are an adult.", "NTA- um no that is THERE job to pay for their kids not you. save your money for your future.", "NTA - Her parents are responsible to pay for her care; babysitting. This burden should not be yours. Continues to invest in what makes your happy. Sorry you have been placed in this situation.  Best to you", "NTA- it's not your job to pay for someone else's childcare.  Your stepmother chose to have a child, your father chose to marry someone with a child. It is their responsibility to pay for child care.

Your father and your stepmother are a new level of asshole. Paying for your stepsister\u2019s college fund and nanny is their responsibility. And why are you paying bills, you\u2019re a minor.

That child is the responsibility of HER mother and HER father.  Not you.\n\nYou deciding to cover your sister's skating?  OK.  \n\nCollege fund for your stepsister???  WHY!!!! \n\nHow about YOUR OWN college fund.  \n\nYour mother needs to stand up for you.  You having a job at all at the age of 14... You should be able to use the little bit you earn to cover your extra curricular expenses, and save for your own college.  NOT cover bills for other people", "NTA. You are a minor. You shouldn't be paying for anything like that. They're abusing you financially.", "NTA. They should not be asking you to contribute to their household for a kid that is not even related to you and you have little connection with.

Can you go live with your mom? You\u2019re old enough for a judge to take your preference into account. You should be keeping all your money and saving for your own college not your step sisters. Have your mom open an account for you and have your job direct deposit the money there if possible.", "NTA. This is very bizarre on the part of your dad and step-mom. It\u2019s one thing if they were taking half of your wages and saving it for you, but if using it to pay for their expenses? No. They are obligated to pay for your care until 18.  On top of it, they\u2019re asking YOU to pay for a sitter for your stepsister because of their working hours? This is very wrong!!  It\u2019s also equally wrong that you\u2019re required to fund a college account for a stepsister you barely know. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you pay for your bio sister\u2019s skating lessons but you have no obligation to pay for any of the housing or other costs related to your dad, stepmother or stepsister.\n\nPlease consider having a trusted adult help you open a bank account that your dad and stepmom don\u2019t have access to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
