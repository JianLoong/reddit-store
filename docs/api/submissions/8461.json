And there\u2019s soooo much going on here:\n\n-  Your parents are taking half your pay to cover medical bills?  Unless the bills are from something you did on purpose, what parent does that???\n\n-  They want you to pay for your step-sister\u2019s babysitter?  What the heck.  That\u2019s not your responsibility.  No matter what you do for tour sister, paying for someone\u2019s babysitter isn\u2019t on you.  What parent asks that???\n\n-  Why is your money going to \u201cfood, furniture, and repairs\u201d?  You\u2019re a minor.  Your parents should be covering all of that, are they not?\n\n-  You\u2019re taking about putting money into step-sister\u2019s college savings and you didn\u2019t have a choice?  What about your own savings, for college or whatever???\n\nOP, there are a LOT of red flags here.  I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re being taken advantage of.  Is there an adult you trust that you can talk to about all of this?", "NTA. You are in no way or form responsible for your stepsister. Not even her college fund. You don't have to give her a penny if you don't want to, and your father is being financially abusive if he pushes you to do so.", "Umm... you give half your wages to your parents and they want EVEN MORE to pay a sitter?\n\nBabs you're asking us the wrong question \ud83d\ude2d\n\nYour parents are huge aholes. You should be getting ALL of your money and should not have to contribute to childcare. \n\nYou're 14 ffs", "NTA. I can't imagine why your father expects you, a child, to pay his family's routine expenses, like childcare. That's not remotely your responsibility.\n\nYou are not obligated to pay for your siblings, step or otherwise. It is very generous of you to pay expenses for your younger sister, but you are not even obliged to do that, let alone pay childcare expenses for your step-sister that you barely know.\n\nI am honestly shocked that your father would even suggest this. He needs to take responsibility for his own finances, instead of guilt-tripping you into paying his bills.", "NTA.\n\nYou shouldn't be giving them half of your money and you shouldn't be paying for what the parents should be paying for.  WTF?  You're being so taken advantage of and they're happy to do it because you're not even aware of how wrong that all is.\n\nIf you OFFER to pay for something, that's one thing.  They're already taking half your paycheck, they need to stop asking you for more. \n\nThe adults in your story are the BIG BIG AHs.", "NTA, I am unsure why you are giving your dad and step mother half of your wages, or why you're somehow expected to pay in for your stepsister's college savings account either. As a third party, this sounds incredibly inappropriate. I don't have much information here, but it doesn't sound like your dad has really turned over a new leaf.", "NTA at all. As your parents they are supposed to take care of you and pay for your hospital bills. You should not be asked to pay for a babysitter for your stepsister. They need to find care arrangements. They were able to manage care for your stepsister before you got your job. This is not your responsibility at all.\n\nWho is taking half your wages? Your father? What is he spending it on? This is not ok. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation. You are not an AH at all. Your parents are abusing you and the situation.", "NTA\n\n> My father and stepmother both work really late so my stepsister needs a sitter. they asked if I could pay for the sitter, and I was really hesitant.\n\nWhy is your father (or stepmother) unable to pay the Babysitter that they would ask you to do so?\n\nI barely see your paying for your biosister's skating, as that's an extra curricular activity and maybe something your parents don't want to budget for, but it's important to you so you pay for it.\n\nI cannot see their expecting you to pay for a babysitter.", "NTA and the only AH here is your dad. \n\nYou're not supposed to pay anything for your step sister, and you're certainly not supposed to pay anything for your hospital bills since you a minor and your parents are supposed to take care of you. \n\nCan you go live with your mom, cause it's obvious that your dad is only taking advantage of you.", "NTA\n\nYour father needs a sitter, not you. There are even scenarios thinkable where you would be paid to do the babysitting. Few people would fault you for being lukewarm to your stepfamily. If it comes up in discussion, you might want to make it clear it was not your decision to have the child. Under no circumstance pay for anything, that is just deranged. Talk to this about your mother and clearly set a boundary here.", "Obvious NTA. None of this should fall on your shoulders in the first place. Not only are they not your kids, but YOU are a kid.", "NTA\n\nThey should never have asked.", "Um, wow, so much to unpack here\u2026 perhaps show them this after all the comments are in. You should NOT be giving them your wages. I am a (politically independent) semi conservative, kinda liberal mom of 8 and I think this is crazy.", "You are 100% definitely NTA. You are already taking more financial responsibility for your family than a minor should. Please please please do not let them convince you that you are selfish for having boundaries, or wanting to use your own money for yourself. You may have to make compromises that are not fair to you while you\u2019re still under their roofs, but please do not take on the message that you are responsible for their lives, or that you\u2019re not allowed to make boundaries or put your own needs first.", "NTA- unless your stepmother and father are completely broke, they need to pay for your food and your stepsister's college fund, let alone babysitter, aren't your responsibility as a minor.  You need to figure out things with your mother (assuming she's decent).", "NTA\n\nThat child is not your responsibility. they are adults, let them figure out their own financial issues.", "Why are you paying for a sitter? Let alone her college fund. \n Shes older than you and your the child?\nThe whole dynamics are wrong and you need to tell them no as they're fully taking advantage of you", "I\u2019d be vacillating between quitting my job, and just keep on working and save half to GTFO ASAP. \n\nI\u2019m appalled for you that they take half your wages. You\u2019re a minor - part of getting a job is to spend your money irresponsibly. I can understand them taking half your pay if they were putting it into an account for you - sort of like a forced savings. But what they\u2019re asking from you, in addition to taking half, is egregious.\n\nNTA", "NTA- You are a CHILD it's your parents job to take care you until you're 18. You shouldn't be giving part of your money to your stepsister college fund nor paying for a sitter. That's on your stepmother, her father and MAYBE your dad. You do things for your sister because you want to, you give more than enough, is there any way you can live with your mother?", "NTA and why would they ask you to pay for her babysitter when it\u2019s their child. She\u2019s only your sister because your father is an AH. Tell them no", "You are not responsible for your siblings. Your parents should be providing for them. You shouldn't give them half your paycheck that you earn yourself. They should be the ones paying for your sisters college. If you're paying for anyone's education, it should be yours. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your parents are major AHs and honestly this is financial abuse.  They are supposed to pay for all your needs and their other kid's needs, not make you pay for them.  And the hospital bills! They are not yours to pay!! That's your parents debt, not yours, because you were a minor!   If you are spending the money you make it should be for extras like your own skating lessons, your own movie ticket, treats, etc.  Clothes, shoes, medical, school supplies, furniture, food, utilities are your parents responsibility until you are an adult.", "NTA- um no that is THERE job to pay for their kids not you. save your money for your future.", "NTA - Her parents are responsible to pay for her care; babysitting. This burden should not be yours. Continues to invest in what makes your happy. Sorry you have been placed in this situation.  Best to you", "NTA- it's not your job to pay for someone else's childcare.  Your stepmother chose to have a child, your father chose to marry someone with a child. It is their responsibility to pay for child care.  I personally don't think you should be paying into her college fund because again she's not your child.", "NTA i know you hate confrontation but you need to stop giving them half your wages", "NTA, but my blood is boiling right now. Your father and your stepmother are a new level of asshole. Paying for your stepsister\u2019s college fund and nanny is their responsibility. And why are you paying bills, you\u2019re a minor. You need to cut off those leeches as soon as you can. What the?!!!", "NTA\n\nYou are 14?  Did I read that right?\n\nYour parents should not be taking any money from you.  It is THEIR responsibility to cover your medical bills, as well as house, clothe and feed you.  You aren't likely earning much.\n\nYou should absolutely not be expected to pay for a baby sitter for your father's new wife's daughter.  Nope, no way, just no.  That child is the responsibility of HER mother and HER father.  Not you.\n\nYou deciding to cover your sister's skating?  OK.  \n\nCollege fund for your stepsister???  WHY!!!! \n\nHow about YOUR OWN college fund.  \n\nYour mother needs to stand up for you.  You having a job at all at the age of 14... You should be able to use the little bit you earn to cover your extra curricular expenses, and save for your own college.  NOT cover bills for other people", "NTA. You are a minor. You shouldn't be paying for anything like that. They're abusing you financially.", "NTA. They should not be asking you to contribute to their household for a kid that is not even related to you and you have little connection with. You owe your dad nothing. \n\nYou are paying for your sister to enjoy something with you. They are expecting you to contribute for them to get more money. They can pay the babysitter.", "NTA. Can you go live with your mom? You\u2019re old enough for a judge to take your preference into account. You should be keeping all your money and saving for your own college not your step sisters. Have your mom open an account for you and have your job direct deposit the money there if possible.", "NTA. This is very bizarre on the part of your dad and step-mom. It\u2019s one thing if they were taking half of your wages and saving it for you, but if using it to pay for their expenses? No. They are obligated to pay for your care until 18.  On top of it, they\u2019re asking YOU to pay for a sitter for your stepsister because of their working hours? This is very wrong!!  It\u2019s also equally wrong that you\u2019re required to fund a college account for a stepsister you barely know. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you pay for your bio sister\u2019s skating lessons but you have no obligation to pay for any of the housing or other costs related to your dad, stepmother or stepsister.\n\nPlease consider having a trusted adult help you open a bank account that your dad and stepmom don\u2019t have access to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
