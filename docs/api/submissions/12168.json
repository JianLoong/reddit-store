You didn't ruin anything. Your grandpa accepted you for who you are, so you came to his funeral as you. Seems pretty logical to me.\n\nYour father's response is way over the top.

I\u2019m so proud of you for wearing a dress and going!! You did the right thing. I\u2019m happy that you went to attend your Grandfather\u2019s funeral.

You dressed as who you are and who your grandfather accepted you as, and if your father only worried about your dress, he couldn't have been mourning very much. It's good you cut ties with him. Even if you weren't trans, you had every right to wear whatever you wanted, as long at it was appropriate to the occasion. As a woman who wears pants almost all the time, I don't see why dresses/skirts are still gendered items; anyone, male or female, should get to wear them if they'd like. Your dad doesn't accept you for you are, and he doesn't respect your choices, either.", "NTA. You didn't ruin your grandfather's funeral. Your father did and notice he managed to hold it together until everyone left and he could target you alone.

I am  also sorry that your family is not accepting your identity & thinks it's something you can just \"turn off\". \n\nIt's completely appropriate for a woman to wear a dress to any solemn or ceremonial gathering (wedding,  christening,  graduation, awards ceremony....and,  yes, funerals) and some people even believe that it's inappropriate for a woman to wear anything but a dress/skirt.

Here's the response I would have sent had the comment not been deleted before I finished my reply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a few issues with your reply.\n\n  \nYou're categorizing being trans into something that is axiomatically bad. It's more of an expression of identity (like the expression protected in the first amendment) that shouldn't be tied to political values. Why does OP's father have to deal with \"his son being trans,\" and why is that necessarily bad? \n\nSecond, reconsider OP's motive. OP did not do this to create issues. OP would have likely worn a dress anyway; they did not specifically do it to contrast their parents. The death of OP's grandfather is likely hitting OP harder than OP's dad, considering the disagreements they certainly had recently regarding OP being trans.  \n\n\nTo address your concluding point: LGBTQ+ is not correlated to political values.
