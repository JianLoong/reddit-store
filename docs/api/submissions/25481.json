You've done your bit. NTA.", "NTA\n\nTbh sometimes people in these scenarios need a hard wake up call. Just wallowing in your depression will only make your condition worse. If you're not doing anything to help yourself or anything to dedicate your time to, you will not get better. You don't just wake up one day no longer depressed and everything is fine. In fact, staying in another person's home and responsibility free will only make it worse.", "NTA depression is hard for everyone, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that person has to take advantage of time. 3 months and no progress, sometimes people need that hard wake up call to get themselves together. Also if your other siblings are pissed why don\u2019t they take in Alex for 3 months?", "[removed]", "NTA - the longer this goes on for the worst it get. You made the right choice. The wording could of been a little better but you are paraphrasing.", "NTA... enabling someone that refuses to help themselves is not helping them.  \n\nGiving them choices even modest ones is helpful. \n\n1. Having daily chores\n2. Seeking medical help\n3. Working, even part time", "NTA. I have mental disabilities, and my husband deals with severe depression from time to time. That doesn't mean that we can ignore our responsibilities. It doesn't mean he can ignore the business he owns. It doesn't mean that I can ignore my therapy appointments or refuse my meds. It also doesn't mean I can use my illnesses as an excuse to take advantage of someone. Also, she's been with you this long, and your other siblings aren't taking her in for just as long? No help, no opinion.", "NTA. Where are your parents in this? Your grandparents? Aunts and uncles? Your other siblings? They're all so happy that you have the burden of caring for Alex so they don't have to. That's why their opinions are worthless.\n\nYou're not a parent. It's not your job to raise or parent your siblings.

Don't get me wrong, you have every right to be angry at the asshole that is taking advantage of you, but you don't have the right to lose your temper and lash out because of that.

Depression is hard but it doesn't get any easier if you don't try. She's not getting therapy and it's easier than ever to get some.\n\nYou have multiple siblings. One of them can take her in or can help you with rent money or help her find therapy. It sounds like they're only criticizing not offering solutions.", "NTA, when are your siblings taking her in and doing their fair share to help Alex?", "NTA. It's been 4 months and no movement.

Etc.", "Your other siblings can then take their turns stepping up to help Alex.  Not only have you done your part, done what you agreed to, but you granted Alex a grace period, and then another grace period.\n\nYou are not asking for too much.  Having depression or any other mental health condition is an explanation at best.  It does not excuse or exempt someone from their responsibilities and obligations.  \n\nAlex has overstayed her welcome.  Everyone knows that.  If anyone wants to criticize your for putting your foot down, great - they've just volunteered to be Alex's next landing point.", "All of your analysis is true, but none of that gives someone the right to lose their temper and yell at the other person. The angry response from OP was based out of a loss of control in their emotions, not on trying to help Alex. A hard wake up call can also be a calculated and reasonable response if one has control of their emotions.", "While I agree OPs response was out of anger and frustration, and perhaps even in the wrong, I can't bring myself to point the finger and deem them TA. Their frustration is pretty reasonable. I'd be fed up too if I was financially caring for an adult who contributes nothing to either the household or to help themselves. And OP entered an agreement with their sibling that they'd move out after 3 months. \n\nAt the absolute very most, I'd give an ESH, but I'm strongly leaning towards NTA.", "You seriously trying to argue over 'rights' here? How about, what 'right' does Alex have to mooch off her sibling and do nothing all day?\n\nIt's OPs living space, and doesn't want somebody doing nothing but being a drain on resources all day every day. That's what 'right' OP has to yell at Alex.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t matter if she has depression or anxiety or just doesn\u2019t wanna grow up, we all have to face reality and take care of ourselves.  I have a friend in his 60\u2019s.  He graduated college, moved back home, found a job in his chosen profession, then quit and decided he would stay and mooch off his folks until he decided what he wanted to do.  Forty years later, he has a part time job for 10 hrs a week, parents pay for near everything, dad died recently and mom doesn\u2019t know what to do with him, never had a serious relationship and his excuse is he has depression.  Never been to a dr for diagnosis or treatment because\u201dthose pills they prescribe make you hurt yourself \u201c.  Soon his mom will die and he\u2019ll be his siblings\u2019 problem.  You are doing everyone a favor,  truly.", "It's so kind of all these people judging you to offer to take their sister in!

I know that first hand. \n\nBut you still have to get your shit together enough to not make yourself a burden on others. If tnst means getting disability then you do so. \n\nAlex is doing nothing. They are being a mooch and you do not need to keep paying for them. They are not your dependent.", "NTA. However, that might be dangerous. Depression can be terminal if untreated, and commebts such as thus can make it worse. \n\nDepression robs every bit energy, which makes you more depressed and drains more energy. That means she actually needs to do stuff to break the cycle. That will be very hard work for her - every step might be painfull, and if it is justto clean the shower or something. \nMayve a job is just out if question for the moment? Maybe the depression is so bad she actually keeds to go stationary? You could go woth her to a psychiatrist. Set rules and a day-planer, keep her occupied and do sport to fight the symptoms. \n\nHiwever, you also need to think about ypur own mental health. That can include having to kick her out before she drags you down, too. \n\nAnd most importantly: get medication!!!! Treatment for depression is often successfull (emphasis on treatment, not on \"healing\").", "It sounds like therapy is needed. There are online psychiatry and psychology practitioners that can be useful. You could maybe help her start with this. \n\nYou are NTA but as you care about your sister.
