I text the landlord if its alright for me to walk around the yard and view the home from the outside and he gives me the okay as he is not there yet and running 10 minutes late. \n\nSo I facetime my sister and brother in law and we admire the landscape and the house. Im also just looking and observing possible hazards. I noticed an empty cigarette box on the porch so I wasn't entirely sure if there used to be a smoker in the unit.\n\nThe landlord arrives and he introduces himself and asks my name. I tell him and say that \"my sister will be watching via facetime as she could not make it.\" My sister and brother in law are in the next state over looking to relocate and could not make it. \n\nI noticed a smell in the home and could not pinpoint what it exactly was. He told me the carpet was new and the walls were painted. I complimented it and said it was beautiful and so did my sister. I started asking if there was a smoker in the unit, he said, \"no.\" I asked if there was a history of black mold in the unit and he said,  \"I have no idea\" quite rude. I went on the 2nd level and whispered, \" I don't like that answer.\" to my sister. \n\n\nMy brother in law (him and my sister were in the same room but he was busy caring for their baby) asked me to see the unit so I briefly showed him. And he said it was a very nice place.\n\nThe landlord was completely disengaged pretty much the entire viewing especially after I asked about black mold. I asked him a question regarding applications and he said, \"Well if you get off the phone, maybe I'll answer you.\" \n\nI was a bit confused, I told him, \"Sir, this is my family on facetime with me. They are applicants as well.\" He responds, \"Well they should have been here. You recorded in my house without my concent.\" I said, \"What? I told you my sister would be watching via facetime.\" He says, \"That was a directive. Not a question.\" \n\nI hang up the phone with my family and ask him, \"What exactly to you need to discuss with me without my family?\" He says, \"You did not ask to record. Now please leave.\"\n\n\nMe and my sister think it could possibly be because we are black and after researching the area, we are very much the minority.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697304479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177ujc7/aita_for_showing_my_familyapplicants_a_home_via/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no question in my mind the LL was lying to you. NTA.", "NTA\n\nMy mother would always say:  if something ain't right, it probably ain't right.  Maybe you can report the agent if you want.  I think you were on the money about black mold.  I wouldn't know if he was a racist or not, but his attitude gives away that there's something in that unit he doesn't want you to see until after you sign and pay a deposit, and you asking questions means he doesn't like that you noticed.\n\nI've heard of realtors, especially during covid, showing homes via FaceTime.  So I think he's hiding something.", "NTA. This is entirely unprofessional behavior on his part. I've never run into landlords or showing agents who did not want potential tenants taking videos/calling family members during a showing or open house.

Sounds about white to me, smh! People are probably gonna come up in here and say you\u2019re overreacting or overthinking or whatever but nah, you\u2019re not.

I'm thinking the funny smell and the smokes outside were weed.", "eh... He did you a favor. find a better place. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou weren't recording anyway so him being stuck on that is a problem. Also if it was a problem, he could have told you no when you first said you were on FaceTime.\n\nHis inability to answer direct questions about mold is sketchy, and he didn't like the idea of a tenant who asked questions and knew what they were looking for. It had nothing to do with the phone. \n\nI'm glad you aren't renting from him.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with race though. You were asking him direct questions and him being worried about you \u201crecording\u201d his answers is because he is a crap landlord and didn\u2019t want record of him lying to you.", "NTA. I have a feeling that you hit on something with the question about mold. The home probably did have a mold issue. When I was house hunting last year one of the houses that I viewed had a smell that both my realtor and I noticed. She checked and the house had flooded before. He\u2019s probably trying to hide something.", ">we haven't had much luck finding a good safe place\n\nAll I can say is that this place clearly wasn't a good safe space so you shouldn't be feeling bad.", "So you were not looking to move in? It was for your sister/BIL/baby? Or were you all planning to live there?  I wonder if that was the issue?\n\nNTA as it doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything wrong.", "Thank you", "Of course he lied, he's a landlord.", "Thank you so much for your response. He greeted me with a smile so I didn't think racism initially. I reported him on the Zillow platform but Im unsure if he's an agent or an actual landlord. \n\nIm glad we dodged a bullet with him. I really love my niece and I don't want her harmed if black mold was the issue", "Thank you. He did me a major favor because he was a headache and a half", "Either way its just sad how people are nowadays. I wish I was more responsible with my money in the past so we could just buy a home and not have to worry about this kind of bullshit.", "Thank you", "Honestly it hurts that people don't want us around because they believe that darker skin harms them\nin some way. We just want a safe quiet home", "[removed]", "Thank you", "He sure did. Thank you", "My sister said the same thing. I agree, it was extremely sketchy that he was dodging the question like that. \n\nIm really glad I avoided that asshole too", "I agree. It\u2019s not a place you\u2019d want to rent. But for future reference, I would have explained to the guy that you were not recording, that it was just a video phone call. He might not have understood and could have felt uncomfortable thinking you were recording his place.\n\nBut it is weird. The place I live now, I took tons of photos when I toured, to show friends to help me make up my mind, and the guys never cared.", "Honestly this all seems more like they are hiding something, not that they are racist. I\u2019m curious, are you young? They probably thought you wouldn\u2019t know much about questions you should ask when looking to buy a place, and then you threw them for a spin by asking the right questions. I\u2019m willing to bet that there are issues in that house, quite possibly mold. You asked specifically about it, as well as the smoking, and now the landlord can\u2019t sell it to you because they lied and they don\u2019t want that to come down on their head later. He made a big deal about the FaceTime just so he had an excuse to act \u201cviolated\u201d and not do business with you.", "What are your thoughts? I honestly hope it wasn't racism", "I did actually try to explain that but he said, \"they should've been here.\" Maybe he doesnt understand video phone calls but regardless Im glad I dont have to deal with someone like that", "Im 26 years old. My sister is 27 and I know my brother in law is in his early 30's. I recently moved out here and got a new job so I don't qualify for a mortgage at the moment. The unit was for rent but I do agree, I think he was hiding something definitely. \n\nAfter really thinking about it, he wouldn't have brought physical applications in if he didnt have intent for me to fill out an application so it can't be racism. He didnt become rude until after the questions", "Yeah I have a feeling he expected you to play the \u201cyoung dumb female\u201d part, and didn\u2019t expect you to know what to look out for. Asking questions about a building\u2019s history is always smart, and this guy seemed to not want to be upfront with the knowledge. I hope anyone else who looks at that place asks questions before just signing.", "Agreed. I hope everyone asks questions until he decides to fix whatever's wrong with the place"]}
