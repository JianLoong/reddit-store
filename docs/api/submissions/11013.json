Many people place large orders for parties with us. It is very common for us to receive orders of 500 sweets, because here in my country it is very common to have sweets at parties. \n\nRecently, a woman who has never ordered anything with me and my mother ordered 100 sweets for a party (minimum order). We did and I went over to her house to deliver it. We live a little far away, but that wasn't a problem for me. When I got there I delivered it in a custom box with the sweets, but the woman who placed the order called me and said she wanted to check it out because \"she didn't want to be stolen\". \n\nThere were a lot of people looking so I felt self-conscious. However, I stayed because I knew I had the right amount. She counted and everyone was looking, in total there were 105 candies (It is common to have a few more because there is dough left to make). When she finished counting, she said I could leave, but then I took the 5 extra candies and left. She asked what I was doing and I replied that \"I didn't want to be robbed\". She was speechless, but didn't say anything.\n\nWhen I got home my mother and I had a little argument, but it didn't continue as my grandmother couldn't stop laughing after I told her what had happened. My mom said I should have known better and not done what I did because it makes me an asshole, but I don't think that's the case. So AITA?\n\nsince some people are very concerned about my mother's business, don't waste your time. We have had this business for years because my grandmother started it and we do orders for many people and events. We have steady clients of all types, including celebrities and event companies. The specific customer who did this found our ad on the internet and placed a small order. Her badmouthing us won't affect us, as we're pretty much the only ones in town that have good sweets at low prices. And we already have several orders scheduled for the YEAR.\n\nI commented to a friend and he pointed out that maybe she was suspicious because my mother and I live in a favela, as the client herself was a woman from the \"white\" area of \u200b\u200bthe city. I don't think that was it, but people from the south side are kind of mean.", "created_utc": 1677463989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11czyw5/aita_for_taking_things_out_of_someones_order/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People on this subreddit often make assumptions about people.", "No you don\u2019t reward shitty behaviour that only encourages them to do it more", "No money will make me bow my head to someone else.", "She was just fixing the order. After all, the customer only ordered 100, not 105. Would be rude not to ensure accuracy after the customer insisted.", "Tem o grupo e a p\u00e1gina, ambos levam o mesmo nome. \u00c9 muito bom ver as hist\u00f3rias aqui no Reddit, estou me adaptando, mas ver relatos Br com aquele jeitinho que s\u00f3 o brasileiro tem \u00e9 cabuloso de bom. N\u00e3o que seja uma competi\u00e7\u00e3o. Esse seu relato \u00e9 exatamente o tipo que a galera do grupo iria amar KKKKKKKK curto, direto e sem perder o jogo de cintura.", "I'm following the thread and stand by my comments. I also agree with everybody who made comments to say this was not the right thing to do, if somebody wants to be rude let them be rude that's about them not about you. You sank to her level proving yourself to be equally rude. Right now this is your mother's business and you don't have the right to negatively impact it like this. When is your business you can do whatever you want with it", "North Americans and Latinos are very different. It seems that some North Americans think they are entitled to be rude, but when someone responds on the same level they are amazed. Here in my country if you are an asshole, basically you are allowing others to be an asshole to you too. No one is entitled to mistreat someone just because he is paying for his service or because he thinks he is the god of reason.", "You seem very smart assy, not cute or professional at all.    Maybe talk to business owners and take some business classes.a business which has been doing well can fail in little time.  One bad review, sure fine.  But an attitude like this, not guessing it will be only once.", "Serious question. How old are you? (I don\u2019t want to assume.)", "Then you\u2019ll probably always live in the slums.", "Vou mandar l\u00e1 ent\u00e3o kkk, n\u00e3o tem Subreddit disso?", "Rio de Janeiro's favelas are actually pretty quiet and common, at least where I live. A third of the city lives in favelas, so it's pretty common. It's not because of poverty, but because of the historical migratory relationship of black people and immigrants in the state. And I'm not ashamed of living in favelas, but of thinking I'm better than someone else for not living there.", "N\u00e3o tem. S\u00f3 saem de l\u00e1 os relatos com permiss\u00e3o, e tem a op\u00e7\u00e3o de postar no modo an\u00f4nimo. Como \u00e9 no Facebook e a maioria das pessoas usam seus perfis pessoais/de trabalho, o grupo \u00e9 fechado para evitar problemas com os empregadores ou at\u00e9 demiss\u00f5es, j\u00e1 que tem gente de todas as \u00e1reas (literalmente todas, de professores \u00e0 garotas de programa) relatando l\u00e1. Tem umas 110 mil pessoas."]}
