Once you have them stay, you will have a hard time getting rid of them if they don't want to leave on their own.\n\nIF you end up letting them stay (which i really hope you won't for reasons mentioned above), make sure to:\n\n- make an actual lease with them, preferably time locked to a short period of time (3-6 months)\n- charge them a market rate rent (in 2013 i remember colleagues paying 1k/month. No idea how it is now but I assume worse).\n- make them pay a market typical security deposit\n- arrange for them to pay part of the bills\n- lock responsibilities in the contract as much as possible\n- make a accurate hand-over protocol when they move in\n\nThis is not to be mean to them but for you to have some sort of security. I'd assume just being charged a market rate will deter them tbh.\n\nI'm pretty sure they're expecting a free ride from you. Actually, I worry that you mentioning that you would take them in if they end up on the street will cause them to seize any effort to find new housing.\n\nBest would be to not make them stay, really.

If they break the rules you can ask them to leave guilt free knowing you tried to help but they didn\u2019t respect you enough to follow them.

There needs to be a lease. There needs to be money being paid and I wouldn't count on them cleaning, just say the rent will include weekly cleaning service.
