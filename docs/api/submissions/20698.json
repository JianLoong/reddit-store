I'm also greatful that I won't have to struggle to find affordable rent like a lot of my friends do.\n\nThe issue I'm having is that 4 of my friends, two couples, are being evicted from their houses before the year is out and are struggling to find places to rent. I love these 4 people more than anything, but they're sloppy, and have a tendancy to host after parties and stuff. Their current house has bottles and cans everywhere, dishes are never cleaned, they somehow have a slug problem. \n\nI let a 5th friend, who was having some serious financial trouble move in with me because she needed the help and she's cleaner and calmer. The 4 friends being evicted caught wind of this and knowing I do technically have two free bedrooms, asked could they move in as well when their lease is up. \n\nI said no, because I do not want 6 people living in my house, especially people who are not properly house trained and will absolutely disrupt my current lifestyle. I don't want to have my space invaded so much, because honestly, it's mine and I want to keep it mine. I told them I won't let them move in with me unless they actually end up sleeping on the streets and even then I'd have my reservations. \n\nThe 4 friends think I'm being an asshole, but I don't think I am, because its my house and I decided who gets to live here. They're all not talking to me and I'm not too sure what to do with the situation now.

You could have set up clear boundaries with them about what you expected in your house, if you decided to let them stay.
