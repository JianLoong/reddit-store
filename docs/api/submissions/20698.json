I had a rather difficult upbringing, single mother, absent father, lived below the poverty line most of my life type shit. When my uncle on my dad's side found out I exist last year, he purchased a house for me in the city I live in to essentially make up for my dad being a POS. I also live in Ireland, where there's a major housing crisis going on \n\nIts a 3 bed 2 bath, but i turned the living room into my bedroom because im lazy and dont want to go up and down stairs all the time, so technically 4. I'm really proud of how I've decorated it, kept it clean and managed all of the bills myself for the last year. I'm also greatful that I won't have to struggle to find affordable rent like a lot of my friends do.\n\nThe issue I'm having is that 4 of my friends, two couples, are being evicted from their houses before the year is out and are struggling to find places to rent. I love these 4 people more than anything, but they're sloppy, and have a tendancy to host after parties and stuff. Their current house has bottles and cans everywhere, dishes are never cleaned, they somehow have a slug problem. \n\nI let a 5th friend, who was having some serious financial trouble move in with me because she needed the help and she's cleaner and calmer. The 4 friends being evicted caught wind of this and knowing I do technically have two free bedrooms, asked could they move in as well when their lease is up. \n\nI said no, because I do not want 6 people living in my house, especially people who are not properly house trained and will absolutely disrupt my current lifestyle. I don't want to have my space invaded so much, because honestly, it's mine and I want to keep it mine. I told them I won't let them move in with me unless they actually end up sleeping on the streets and even then I'd have my reservations. \n\nThe 4 friends think I'm being an asshole, but I don't think I am, because its my house and I decided who gets to live here. They're all not talking to me and I'm not too sure what to do with the situation now. AITA?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, they are being evicted because the property is being sold, and I believe demolished to make way for something else but I'm not 100% certain on that", "created_utc": 1687840093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14k3bu7/aita_for_not_letting_my_friends_move_into_my_house/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are far too many posts on here about people letting their friends and family move in \"temporarily\" or as renters and it goes to shit. It's your house and you don't have to let anyone live there unless you want to. It sucks they're in that situation, but it's not your responsibility. The fact that they seem to feel entitled to move in proves that you're making the right choice not letting them. That being said, you're likely going to lose these friendships, but that's because of their entitlement, not your fault. Stand your ground. You don't want to be the next person evicting them after they've made a huge mess of your house, not contributed anything financially, and made no real plans to move out.", "NTA.

Just because you have the room for them, it doesn\u2019t mean you *have* to let them stay with you (and most likely destroy your house).

There is no price on personal peace and you clearly ran the possibles through what would give you that.

Are they dogs?) , especially the comment \u201cI told them I won\u2019t let them move in with me unless they actually end up sleeping on the streets and even then I\u2019d have my reservations.\u201d Is vile. You could have set up clear boundaries with them about what you expected in your house, if you decided to let them stay. Even telling them they could stay with you only for a certain amount of weeks/months while they continuously looked for long term housing could have been an option. The thing that really gets me is a comment that you replied to saying that their lifestyle \u201ctendency to host after parties and stuff.. bottles and cans everywhere, dishes are never cleaned\u201d is your lifestyle too! \u201cI'll be completely honest, I do live the same lifestyle, I just don't like the idea of my space becoming the place to facilitate that lifestyle. I still sesh with them, but very very rarely in my own house.\u201d (-You\u2019re comment), to me it sounds like your the person at the party who attends, has a great time (hell even leaves a few bottles/cans laying around), then goes home and would never dream of hosting. \n\nAnd honestly your right, its YOUR house, so you\u2019re well within your rights to deny them a place to stay. BUT the 4 people who you love more than anything (even though you would have reservations about giving them a place to temporarily live if they became homeless..) are well within their rights to not consider you a friend anymore.\n\nSorry if my post is set up weird, first time commenting", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
