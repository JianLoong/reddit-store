Solved.", "Honestly, as a trans person, seeing as you already have gone through the name change dance a couple times on the stocking, you really have already gone above and beyond.  I would have been happy with a name removed and replaced with a motif that fit my brand/general mood added (in my case, stars or rocketry or anything atomic).  My MIL has my old name engraved on things like napkin rings and stockings and that shit is expensive and hard to change.  I wouldn't ask someone to do a bunch of work if I was still figuring out a name.  You can be supportive without having to waste oodles of time.", "Omg you\u2019re EMBROIDERING it?! Not just a vinyl or iron on or whatever?! Honestly really entitled of them to expect you do this over and over again. Tell them that until something is set in stone, they\u2019ll either deal with the name they keep going back to or no name at all on the stocking, their indecision isn\u2019t your problem.", "Any way you could tell the kid he\u2019s welcome to come over and you\u2019ll show him how to remove and redo the name? Not saying he has to be successful at it. Maybe it will just show him how much work it is and help him understand why asking you to change it constantly isn\u2019t reasonable. I don\u2019t know. This seems like a sticky situation and I hope you\u2019re able to find a solution but I can at least say you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "Sis is asking for the impossible.  She wants everything without having to do any of the work (and I have to assume she doesn't understand the amount of time spent changing the names).  \n\nIt's time to tell sis - \"There's not enough time to change the name on the stocking so it will either have deadname, be mismatched, or we simply don't do stockings this year.  I may not have made it clear before, but I already changed the name X times spending Y amount of time to do so.  It's 5 days before Christmas and I don't have the time to do it for a Zth time.  I absolutely want to be supportive of nephew and will make sure the stocking has his chosen name next year.  For this year how would you like to handle it?\"", "NTA You've been embroidering the name over and over? Omg, you're so kind. They'd get one re-do from me, and then I'd have to tell mom and kid to grab a needle and thread to do it themselves. That's SO MUCH work to ask of someone during the holidays. Very rude behavior from them. If matching is so important, they better decide on a name and get to work.", "Buy a bunch of cheap matching blank ones for this year. That way they match but you don't have to worry about anyone having the wrong name.", "Tell him that he can come over and you will show him how to rip out the embroidery.... And then make him do the work. \"Or you can wait until next year. I am sorry I don't have time to remove your old name before Christmas.\"", "The male version is just Noel, do you have time to rip out the le? It's not a perfect solution but it's a compromise.", "Oh, okay, I understand that. Darn I was hoping to help. Maybe just leave it the way it is and wait for the child's name to be set. Sorry I couldn't help.", "OP - take everyone\u2019s stocking away, it\u2019s too much aggravation, NTA", "Put a stocking with all the names he has given you crossed out and Sam at the bottom.", "Nta, there\u2019s still 5 days left, no guarantees sam makes it the 5 days.  Hugs, this has to be insanely frustrating to you.", "Just put \"Him\"", "Not this one...  nope...  the other ones are funny but don't do this one.", "Tell sister too bad. You don't have the time.", "Then your sister can get them herself", "Options:\n1. They match and his says Noelle.\n2. They don't match.\n\nLet your sister choose.", "It\u2019s time for your sister to start sewing and embroidering in time to have the stocking made by Christmas Eve. You\u2019ve made all accommodations and aren\u2019t refusing to accept your nephew as your nephew.  You don\u2019t owe them seven stockings due to your sister making demands about aesthetics.", "Thank you for trying to support your nephew. As a crafter, the constantly redoing embroidery would drive me up the wall, but dead naming shouldn't be the way to go. \n\nHopefully, one day, your nephew finds a name he likes and wants permanently. For now, maybe put a felt patch over his dead name with \"Sam\" written in with fabric pen or iron on letters. This way you could just use safety pins or like 1 stitch in each corner to attach it, and swap it out if he changes it by next year. And he needs to keep a name for at least a year before you embroider the final time.", "So take all the names off.", "I understand that. But he doesn't need to agonize over a name, now does he?", "I have one, so not sure why you think I need one? for calling our trolls? sorry I don't support transphobic people making bullshit posts.", "Nope. Read it. She\u2019s the asshole. Make the fuckin stocking. This is a kid. This is family. Just do it. This isn\u2019t a difficult situation at all tbh", "Now, please continue explaining to the internet why it's okay to try and control someone's relationship to their deadname on their first christmas out.", "If you look at the reply below, you'll see what your nibling is getting in their daily life and you'll understand why things like this are important. As an embroiderer, I get ripping things out is a pain... but making home safe for trans youth sometimes means not doing things that multiple family members have said hurts them.", "I'm trans and have zero faith in people posting about their trans family members, so I'm glad to hear that!", "Formerly known as\u2026", "As a trans person this is actually a good idea honestly. Cheap stocking from CVS and the kid can write his name when he gets there", "Love this!", "I doubt she will go for that especially since the kids like their stockings", "I don't see why the OP should have to spend more time and money, and the other miss out on their personalised stockings that they like, because this kid is buggering about changing their mind so often.\n\nI mean, it's good for kids to explore who they are! Great for them! But they don't get to insist everyone else's time and attention is at their constant disposal.\n\n(NTA, OP.)", "No, no no. From the story it seems like the entire stocking is embroidered, not just the cuff. An inexperienced stitcher ripping out stitching will likely not just damage the name stitching (no big deal), but the structural integrity of the base fabric (very big deal, no real way of fixing that). In that case the entire stocking is trash.\n\nI agree teen in question needs to learn how much effort it takes, but making it an extra hard job for OP is not the way.", "Theyve worked hard enough. Its time for the brat to learn the hard way nobody cares, they arent the center of attention.", "Lol no way. Just because he is changing his name like clothes doesn't mean everyone else should be punished.", "Mfs see a comment with a couple dislike and hop on it for a couple internet points", "What part of dont have the time means they have the time to remove it", "I don\u2019t have the time, I need to rip the stitches out and take it out in the fabric and then put it back together\n\nI would have to do all of them, would take even longer than putting Sam in", "Some people may like a stocking with their name on it.", "They dont have the time and dont want to. Why ruin everyone elses stocking to accomadate a brat", "That's up to him", "For a trans person it can be agony. That\u2019s the dysphoria in gender dysphoria.", "It's not transphobic to question something a trans person does.", "It is literally a difficult situation because what is being asked is physically difficult to do. She made the stocking already, and accommodated him multiple times. This isn't erasing something written in pencil, it's embroidered in, you can't keep \"just do(ing) it\" you obviously don't understand what that entails.", "Tell her she needs to bring the stockings then. If they're going to make it this difficult, they need to come up with the solution.", "NTA.\n\nPin a dry erase sticker on his stocking together with one of those dry erase markers that have an eraser on the tip.  It can be updated in real time with minimal effort.", "Don't force a change on people who are happy with their named stocking. I think that will just make them resent your nibling.", "At this point she can make it. Or your nephew can make his own. \n\nIt is absolutely unrealistic to have someone change their name on a gift several times. \n\nI would put my foot down and say \u201cuntil you have legally changed your name to what you are keeping I will not make any more changes. Here\u2019s a blank stocking, put your name on it.\u201d", "Magic marker sam over the offending name.", "It's transphobic to make several fake posts about a Transperson constantly changing their name to get a reaction out of people and make a transperson into a villian.", "So do it again and keep both. It\u2019ll take a couple hours. Big fuckin deal. My god. Imagine valuing some god damn minutes over an actual child. Heartless fucks.  Just do it. Take the time. It\u2019s a kid. It\u2019s family. Suck it up and show the kid love and support. It\u2019s not difficult. Just do it.", "Even if I color in, the name will be seen since different texture of fabric", "You're making up shit in your head to try and be offended.  Take your advice"]}
