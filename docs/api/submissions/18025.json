Wouldn't you ask your teenager to take a ten minute shower so their sibling is a bit less likely to die? C'mon man, we're talking about a quick shower and change of clothes, not a fucking marathon. Also, he's probably touching a lot more things than a guest would... and if she could ask guests to completely decontaminate themselves before coming in, I'm sure she would. \n\nSometimes we ask certain people we're close to (e.g. family, including the son you gave birth to) for things we don't ask from guests.

She is being absurd", "Something that people don't seem to be bringing up as much yet is what the shower communicates. I don't want to extrapolate too much and make things all metaphorical, as the shower *does* actually serve a practical purpose (it may not completely eliminate the risk of cross-contamination, but showering and putting on fresh clothing would likely lower the risk. Of death. Just a reminder, the risk is death and not a paper cut.), but it also serves as proof that the son is willing to spend a grand total of ten minutes of his life taking a shower (as a teenager, it's hard to have too many anyway) and slightly inconvenience himself to ensure that his sister is safe.\n\nIf a teenager can't take a ten minute shower and change clothes to lower someone's risk of death, I'd be hesitant to fully trust them to understand the seriousness of the situation. I mean, is he going to sneak in some peanut m&m's, slather some hand sanitizer on afterward (which does nothing, as peanuts aren't bacteria), just think \"Ehh, it'll be fine.\", then cause her daughter to have a reaction and potentially die?\n\nPart of this is about the fact that the son doesn't seem to understand the risks involved and isn't willing to make very minor and very necessary compromises. A quick shower and change of clothes? Really?? Even if OP is a hypochondriac (which I'm not necessarily saying!), agreeing to a very minor and predictable inconvenience for the sake of someone's life isn't asking for a lot.\n\nWhen I worked with someone with severe peanut allergies, I would always take care to wash my hands after eating anything contaminated and would purposely minimize accidental contamination. The entire time, I kept reflecting on how unfair it was that my freedom was being infringed upon and... oh wait, no, I was thinking about how much I didn't want to be accidentally responsible for the death of my coworker.

He *could* shower at their house and it would certainly be better than not showering at all, but it sounds like he was just getting frustrated and being a bit stubborn. He was already at his house, had taken a shower that morning, spent several hours exposing himself and his clothing to potential contaminants, then decided that it was \"good enough\" and refused to clean himself off and change clothes again before going to his mom's house. \n\nIt sounds like there's a bit of a disconnect with him, like he doesn't really get it and isn't taking things seriously. He *could* take a shower at their house (but part of me doubts he'd be willing to do so there if he wouldn't at his own house), but... why? It's safer and more convenient for him to simply do so at his own house, in this particular case. It was more about his intentions in this particular circumstance.\n\nAlso, the moms don't have another place to take a shower before coming into the house... he does at the moment. If he stayed with them full time, he'd obviously just come home and take a shower like them -- it would be slightly less safe than showering somewhere else, but that would be the only practical option.", "It\u2019s a \u201cfounded\u201d reason, clearly explained in the OP. \n\nIt\u2019s very easy to \u201cfind\u201d, if you read the post. \n\nNothing \u201cunfounded\u201d about it at all. \n\nLet me guess - you\u2019re one of those people who don\u2019t believe in allergies\u2026.!?", "Again, the standards are different because what he's interacting with in the house is different.

In this case, it's not an \"unfounded reason\". He is literally covered in particles that could kill his own sister if she comes into contact with them, then acting like it doesn't matter and it's a horrible burden to rinse himself off and change clothes before coming into her home. If he came home covered in arsenic, would you say \"Don't act like he's unclean, just love him for who he is! \\*sobbing\\*\"\n\nLike, I get where you're coming from.... but he *is literally covered in a deadly substance* and mom is simply asking that he takes a quick shower and changes clothes before interacting with everyone and everything in their house (far more than a guest would) to minimize the *risk of death*.

They may involve any protective act that an individual carries out to avoid becoming contaminated or to remove contamination that has somehow already occurred. Compulsions of this type may include:\n*excessive and sometimes ritualized hand washing\n*disinfecting or sterilizing things\n*throwing things away\n*frequent clothes changes\n*creating clean areas off-limits to others\n*avoiding certain places or touching things\n\nIn an attempt to keep clean and minimize compulsions, some sufferers will create two different worlds for themselves; one clean and one dirty. The two worlds may exist side-by-side like parallel universes that are never allowed to meet.\n\nIn some cases, family members have been drawn into the sufferer\u2019s web of compulsions. It leads to resentment and fighting, as family members feel increasingly imposed upon and their lives become limited.

No peanuts or peanut products for any of them.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand the seriousness of peanut allergies before I took that job.

I can't do takeout. I can't have coffee dates or attend barbecues. Do people have any idea just how much socialization revolves around food/drink? I can't do any of it safely unless other people make the necessary accommodations to include me. People don't, so I just don't socialize anymore. I won't die from exposure to my allergens but I WILL get very very sick from it, to the point it's not worth socializing. \n\nHaving food allergies causes a lot of anxiety because you have to be constantly on guard. It's not just food either. Depending on your allergies you often have to be vigilant about other things like ingredients in your prescription meds, or if there's latex in things (because cross reactivity is a bitch like that), or what's in the products that come in contact with your skin (holy buckets there's corn and gluten in fucking everything these days), or a million other things. It's not just ingesting the food directly, it's also having to worry about the ways things can get into your digestive tract in ways other than eating it, like hydrolyzed vegetable protein or rice protein in hair care products. I'm not eating my hair obviously, but it touches my face and my hands which means it could get into my system if I'm not careful. You ALWAYS have to be aware of potential cross contamination from literally everything in your life. \n\nI can't imagine having such a severe allergy that even extremely minor cross contamination causes a life threatening reaction. I already have lots of anxiety due to my allergies potentially making me sick, but knowing I might die from it? I can't imagine what that would do to a child's mental health.\n\nAsking the brother to bathe properly at the right time (because for real, doing it any other time than right before leaving negates the whole reason he's doing it) is a very small ask to prevent his sister from potentially dying due to his carelessness. As for the people crying double standard, well, are you letting your guests touch everything in your house? Guests in my house are only allowed in certain areas, only wearing masks (yay fucked up immune system that freaks out about benign things but won't fight off viruses), and they are supervised so I know exactly what has been touched and needs to be sanitized as soon as they leave. I will not let people stay at my house overnight (or let them get cozy) because it means having to sanitize my entire house since someone actively living in that space instead of just sitting politely on the couch contaminates far more things and I can't exactly follow them around every waking moment with clorox.\n\nPeople who don't have severe allergies or who aren't immunocompromised don't understand what a prison it is to live like this out of necessity, nor do they understand how essential it is to have a safe space where you don't need to constantly worry about getting sick or dying while all you're trying to do is exist. If I don't do these things I can die from a minor infection, just like OP's daughter can die from minor cross contamination.\n\nAsking people who will be occupying your space to accommodate a potentially deadly health condition is not unfair and having cleaning standards tailored to how much stuff will be contaminated is not a double standard. Every time someone outside my bubble enters my house I am literally risking death and it really fucks with your mental health.

My grandmother was an ER doctor for a long time and once stopped a woman on the bus to say 'I'm sorry, you're in ketoacidosis, you need to go to the hospital right now' and was very confused when she explained she was doing it on purpose and wouldn't go to the hospital.", "I think I'm part sniffer dog.

It's honestly a privilege to be able to walk around in the world knowing that someone is an asshole to you because they don't like \\*you\\* instead of not liking you because you're gay.", "How on earth did she manage to do that with out exposing herself to the allergens?\n\nI'm genuinely curious, cus that sounds super risky for her, but obviously the benefits is incredible after training.", "sounds like the father thinks OP's just being difficult - so I believe it's likely has got son to think it's no big deal", "No, they're just heartless. You don't have to be a parent to care about not exposing someone to their allergens.  \nWhen my daughter was 5 and in preK, we were told one of her classmates had a peanut allergy.  All the school requested was that everyone make sure to wash their hands and brush their teeth before coming to school if they ate any peanut products beforehand.  At the age of 5, my daughter had me buy her sunbutter for her to eat instead of peanutbutter because she didn't want to risk accidentally bringing peanut butter residue to school and making her classmate sick. The school provided all of the food for breakfast and lunch, so it wasn't even like she wanted it for a packed meal. She just decided to stop eating peanut butter at home because she didn't want to risk her classmate's health.  At 5, she understood the importance of proper hygiene to prevent cross contamination of an allergen, so the OP's son is old enough to understand as well. It's just a question of how much does he care about risking someone's life to put in the effort needed to reduce the risk of exposure.", "Wait, what?

So many people said something Akin to \"Well, I know someone whose allergy is 10x as bad, and they don't even have to stay away from peanuts.\" \n\nIts completely nonsense, they clearly know someone with less severe allergys.

I saw \"Collie\" and automatically thought \"Border\". Lol", "Rough collies are an incredibly intelligent breed in general. (I have one myself and she\u2019s a bit of a goober but she\u2019s very smart. About as smart as my aussie, actually.) They\u2019re also highly emotionally intelligent. You should do some research.
