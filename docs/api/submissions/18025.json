Showering at his own house, putting on fresh clothing, perhaps even using a tissue or some other barrier to open doors and touch items in his house, immediately coming out and leaving to go to her house... that's likely the safest.

If you can reduce the chance of your child dying by 85% vs 60% (pulled those stats out of my ass), wouldn't you want that? Wouldn't you ask your teenager to take a ten minute shower so their sibling is a bit less likely to die? C'mon man, we're talking about a quick shower and change of clothes, not a fucking marathon. Also, he's probably touching a lot more things than a guest would... and if she could ask guests to completely decontaminate themselves before coming in, I'm sure she would. \n\nSometimes we ask certain people we're close to (e.g. family, including the son you gave birth to) for things we don't ask from guests.

If you have to slightly inconvenience yourself on occasion to lower the risk of your sibling dying... that's the unfair reality of life.\n\nHim interpreting it the way he does, including potentially deciding not to visit anymore, is another unfair reality of life.

I don't want to extrapolate too much and make things all metaphorical, as the shower *does* actually serve a practical purpose (it may not completely eliminate the risk of cross-contamination, but showering and putting on fresh clothing would likely lower the risk. Of death. Just a reminder, the risk is death and not a paper cut.), but it also serves as proof that the son is willing to spend a grand total of ten minutes of his life taking a shower (as a teenager, it's hard to have too many anyway) and slightly inconvenience himself to ensure that his sister is safe.\n\nIf a teenager can't take a ten minute shower and change clothes to lower someone's risk of death, I'd be hesitant to fully trust them to understand the seriousness of the situation. I mean, is he going to sneak in some peanut m&m's, slather some hand sanitizer on afterward (which does nothing, as peanuts aren't bacteria), just think \"Ehh, it'll be fine.\", then cause her daughter to have a reaction and potentially die?\n\nPart of this is about the fact that the son doesn't seem to understand the risks involved and isn't willing to make very minor and very necessary compromises. A quick shower and change of clothes? Really?? Even if OP is a hypochondriac (which I'm not necessarily saying!), agreeing to a very minor and predictable inconvenience for the sake of someone's life isn't asking for a lot.\n\nWhen I worked with someone with severe peanut allergies, I would always take care to wash my hands after eating anything contaminated and would purposely minimize accidental contamination. The entire time, I kept reflecting on how unfair it was that my freedom was being infringed upon and... oh wait, no, I was thinking about how much I didn't want to be accidentally responsible for the death of my coworker.

He *could* shower at their house and it would certainly be better than not showering at all, but it sounds like he was just getting frustrated and being a bit stubborn. He was already at his house, had taken a shower that morning, spent several hours exposing himself and his clothing to potential contaminants, then decided that it was \"good enough\" and refused to clean himself off and change clothes again before going to his mom's house. \n\nIt sounds like there's a bit of a disconnect with him, like he doesn't really get it and isn't taking things seriously. He *could* take a shower at their house (but part of me doubts he'd be willing to do so there if he wouldn't at his own house), but... why? It's safer and more convenient for him to simply do so at his own house, in this particular case. It was more about his intentions in this particular circumstance.\n\nAlso, the moms don't have another place to take a shower before coming into the house... he does at the moment.

In this case, it's not an \"unfounded reason\". He is literally covered in particles that could kill his own sister if she comes into contact with them, then acting like it doesn't matter and it's a horrible burden to rinse himself off and change clothes before coming into her home. If he came home covered in arsenic, would you say \"Don't act like he's unclean, just love him for who he is! \\*sobbing\\*\"\n\nLike, I get where you're coming from.... but he *is literally covered in a deadly substance* and mom is simply asking that he takes a quick shower and changes clothes before interacting with everyone and everything in their house (far more than a guest would) to minimize the *risk of death*.

Look say he takes another shower at dads, changes knt he bathroom. Touches the bathroom doorknob. The outside doorknob. He could be contaminated. Moms both shop their clothing could be contaminated....they are getting into the car. Doubt they scrub the car every outing. \n\n maybe have a discussion about him coming home straight to the bathroom to shower at their house.

Maybe talk to him and say then you need to shower when you get right home, make the dad drop him off so the car isn't contaminated.\n\nI doubt her guests just stand around.

That was just the impression I got. If she constantly has people over who (against her wishes and requests) contaminate everything in the house on a regular basis, that's a different story...\n\nFair points, though. I think I actually mentioned something about touching doorknobs and things of that nature in another comment and conceded that everything just *reduces* risk, rather than completely eliminating it. And very good suggestion about the service dog.", "My coworker's allergies weren't as severe, I can't really think of anything that I would've interacted with using anything other than my hands, and we were in a public area where my coworker had a reasonable expectation of coming into contact with contaminants. Their risk of death due to a reaction was lower, my risk of contaminating something was lower, and their expectation of safety in that environment was lower. My point was that I was willing to mildly inconvenience myself for the safety of others. Each situation is different, but I get what you're saying. There's no perfect or simple answer to some of this.\n\nIt's about *minimizing* risk. Would it have technically been safer if I had showered twelve times and put on a hazmat suit? Yeah. If it'd been his home, his personal \"safe zone\", and he had asked me to do so, I would've. Or else I would have simply declined to go. But if that had been his requirement, he'd have every right to turn me away.\n\nAlso, I know a lot of people get pissed off about this, but sometimes it's okay to ask family and close friends for (small!) things you wouldn't normally ask people for. Fair or not, that's kind of part of the deal. That's part of being a family and loving each other -- sometimes you do things (within reason) that you don't particularly want to do, because you know they'd do the same for you.\n\nAsking your teenage son to take a quick shower so that his sister is less likely to die isn't exactly a deal breaker.

But if anyone is in the house and touching everything for long periods they need to be entirely clean. \n\nA girls life isn't worth someone not having to shower or feel as loved.

That\u2019s not to mention that these are young kids, and that as foods go, peanut butter is definitely one of the ones that\u2019s easiest to make a mess with. For example, if you\u2019re a kid and you get a little on your fingers or the counter, son touches the same area, and then carries that transfer to the other house. That would literally be the level of transfer OP has stated has actually happened before and caused a reaction.\n\nSo, to answer your completely serious and polite question to the other commenter \u2014 while you CAN eat peanut butter without being \u201ccovered\u201d in it, that is not the point here.", "After I read that she only makes her son shower, and not her guests, she's definitely an AH for that double standard.
