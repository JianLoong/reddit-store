Showering at his own house, putting on fresh clothing, perhaps even using a tissue or some other barrier to open doors and touch items in his house, immediately coming out and leaving to go to her house... that's likely the safest.

If you can reduce the chance of your child dying by 85% vs 60% (pulled those stats out of my ass), wouldn't you want that? Wouldn't you ask your teenager to take a ten minute shower so their sibling is a bit less likely to die? C'mon man, we're talking about a quick shower and change of clothes, not a fucking marathon. Also, he's probably touching a lot more things than a guest would... and if she could ask guests to completely decontaminate themselves before coming in, I'm sure she would. \n\nSometimes we ask certain people we're close to (e.g. family, including the son you gave birth to) for things we don't ask from guests.

If you have to slightly inconvenience yourself on occasion to lower the risk of your sibling dying... that's the unfair reality of life.\n\nHim interpreting it the way he does, including potentially deciding not to visit anymore, is another unfair reality of life.

I don't want to extrapolate too much and make things all metaphorical, as the shower *does* actually serve a practical purpose (it may not completely eliminate the risk of cross-contamination, but showering and putting on fresh clothing would likely lower the risk. Of death. Just a reminder, the risk is death and not a paper cut.), but it also serves as proof that the son is willing to spend a grand total of ten minutes of his life taking a shower (as a teenager, it's hard to have too many anyway) and slightly inconvenience himself to ensure that his sister is safe.\n\nIf a teenager can't take a ten minute shower and change clothes to lower someone's risk of death, I'd be hesitant to fully trust them to understand the seriousness of the situation.

In this case, it's not an \"unfounded reason\". He is literally covered in particles that could kill his own sister if she comes into contact with them, then acting like it doesn't matter and it's a horrible burden to rinse himself off and change clothes before coming into her home.

However, this is certainly a parenting moment, one of which you need to focus on your son. He's probably feeling eclipsed by her allergy because of how serious you are about it. He needs to feel like he's a priority, too.\n\nReach out to your son and spend some time with him. Apologize for not realizing how you were making him feel and take him out to do something with just the two of you. Don't mention your daughter's allergy for the duration of the whole activity. Afterward, have a talk with him about why you are so serious. Tell him about the routine you go through every single week to keep your daughter safe and the one you use when you get home from the outside. \n\nExplain to him that you must be careful because if your daughter/his sister dies, it falls on you as a parent. Then, give him some time to process. Maybe even suggest brainstorming a better safety plan together so that he feels included and like he has a choice in this situation. \n\nYour ex is an AH, though.", "NTA- this is life or death and all you're asking him to do is take a shower, which directly minimizes her risk of a reaction. it's understandable that he finds that frustrating but he needs to learn to deal, and his father definitely needs to get on board with prioritizing your daughter's health over your son's convenience.", "I am curious about one thing: you wrote your son has two half-brothers, but you called your daughter is sister even though she is his half-sister.\n\nAnyway, I hope you compliment you son for showering for his half-sister.

That would have had an intersection of about 28 \u201csafe\u201d foods and also required her to unnecessarily restrict her own already severely limited diet since I\u2019m anaphylactic to one of the fruits she can eat. Such a restricted diet isn\u2019t healthy or safe for the rest of the house; we had no choice but to figure it out.We even had toddlers! That meant that we had to be very vigilant about hand washing for everyone. She had to learn not to touch her face (because although she also reacts to touch it\u2019s obviously more severe if consumed). We had to learn to wipe down surfaces properly. We had to learn not to wave or throw food around.\n\nYou could do this too. Your son has the right to not feel like he\u2019s a walking contaminant. Some people don\u2019t particularly enjoy getting wet or dressing/undressing multiple times in the day (esp true if you are ND). Whatever his reasoning that day was, he set a trap for you. He basically wanted to know who was more important - him or his sister. It\u2019s a false choice because the actual answer ought to be both but in my experience kids don\u2019t think that way.\n\nWhy on earth didn\u2019t you go and do something else with him somewhere else?

Compulsions of this type may include:\n*excessive and sometimes ritualized hand washing\n*disinfecting or sterilizing things\n*throwing things away\n*frequent clothes changes\n*creating clean areas off-limits to others\n*avoiding certain places or touching things\n\nIn an attempt to keep clean and minimize compulsions, some sufferers will create two different worlds for themselves; one clean and one dirty. The two worlds may exist side-by-side like parallel universes that are never allowed to meet.\n\nIn some cases, family members have been drawn into the sufferer\u2019s web of compulsions. It leads to resentment and fighting, as family members feel increasingly imposed upon and their lives become limited.

Extreme allergies are more common now than they used to be.", "He could, but it doesn't sound like he's interested in doing that", "All truly good points that have been creeping up in the back of my mind and eroding my resolve on the issue....\n\nI suppose, in a way, I'm a bit reluctant to admit that the precautions (that, again, I'm not convinced are *completely* futile) being utilized may not be effective because... then what? I'm getting a bit more blunt than I intended to on reddit here, I suppose.\n\nI know (and so does the mom, most likely) that you can't completely eliminate certain risks, you can just do your best to minimize them. I'm quite aware of the fact that her kid could come into contact with peanuts, end up rummaging around in his closet and drawers and end up transferring some of it to his freshly washed clothes (which may or may not have been contaminated before they were even put away). No matter how hard they try, the daughter will never be completely safe.\n\nWhile rationalizing and coming to terms with this, though, I'm just focused on minimizing the risk to whatever degree possible. The clothes that were rummaged through and potentially contaminated in the location he touched are still probably less of a risk than the clothes he's been lounging around in all day. It's far from a perfect solution and doesn't remove the risk, but could potentially decrease it.\n\nI'm not claiming to have the answer here, I don't think there really *is* an answer... The protein allergen present in peanuts doesn't degrade (as you mentioned) -- it's present for approximately 110 days on unwashed contaminated surfaces, it doesn't easily denature, it's present to some degree in most environments, it's to an extent unavoidable. Washing something with soap or in a very high temperature will usually remove/denature the protein causing the reaction, so that's sort of the best we can do...\n\nIt's a bit better than nothing, but I don't want anyone to develop a false sense of security because of it.", "You think\u2026.*a shower?* isn\u2019t realistic?\n\n\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n      \n\n\nA shower?", "He did shower that day.

He needs to shower before entering the house, showering then spending the day in a house full of peanut butter undo\u2019s the showers purpose, so yes, he\u2019d need to do it again.
