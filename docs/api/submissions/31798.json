Your daughter has been in your life longer than your SD, so it should go to her. I understand where your DH is coming from, as that would be a great way to show SD you accept her. But I would only say that should be the case if your SD came into your life first and *then* you and DH had a daughter together. In that instance it would be worth a discussion on who should receive the necklace, because at that point I would hope she would be considered an actual daughter. (But you\u2019re still not the A H in that situation either, only your response would make you the a h, more on that in a second.)\n\nCurrently, you\u2019re not the AH. \n\nWhere you could be one though, is if you did what happened to me. (Bringing this up because sometimes I think people forget that the kids in these situations are kids with feelings, and they didn\u2019t ask for their role in the grownup situations) My parents (mom and step dad) got together when I was around 9, about two years later my sister was born. My step dad was the only father I knew, and his family was the only family I had. (Moms family lived across the country and we saw them yearly at best) so you can imagine the shock and hurt I felt when said baby sister was admiring my \u201cgrandmas\u201d necklace with adorable baby babble - she was 1ish? - and while I was sitting on the couch next to them both, \u201cgrandma\u201d said to her, \u201cdo you like my necklace?!

Give your daughter the necklace, and purchase a ring or something similar from you to SD. Give it to her on her 15th birthday. Make it special and a big deal. Because she didn\u2019t ask for her parents to get divorced and she didn\u2019t know she would be thrust into a situation where she would always be second guessing where she fits into the family, or who is \u201cmore family\u201d than she is.", "NTA.\n\nThe way I would have told him to get his shit  and daughter and get out.

Gift it to Emily as planned and also gift her a cheaper necklace that she can wear now. Explain to her that you\u2019ll transfer the safety deposit box to her name when she turns 18 but that until then you don\u2019t want it getting lost of stolen so you strongly suggest she keep it in that safety deposit box. Get Sophia another appropriate necklace (you can find a decent one that can still become a future heirloom for a couple hundred dollars) and gift her that one in a safety deposit box along with a similar cheaper one she can wear now. Write a heartfelt note to her that goes with it. This way neither 14 year old has an expensive necklace that is being fought over in their possession and neither knows whose expensive necklace is worth more in terms of cost. Gifting it to either one to wear now is going to result in it getting damaged or stolen either by a jealous \u201cfamily\u201d member or because with teenagers that stuff occasionally happens. Even if Emily just misplaces it or has it stolen by an unrelated friend it\u2019s going to create conflict because Sophia feels entitled to it and the \u201cthis is why it should have gone to me instead\u201d will start. If Sophia and Emily both handle it well, consider increasing the jewelry in their respective safety deposit boxes at future birthdays and other life events so that by the time they are each 18 it\u2019s less about who has more or who got THE necklace and instead they both have a small collection of nice jewelry they can wear or pass down with some sentimental meaning behind it.

If something happens to you, well you now know that you cannot expect your husband to treat your daughter fairly. That realization may or may not have impacts for how you stay married, manage things like joint property, etc. Personally I\u2019d leave over this. It sounds like a small thing, but this has to do with fairness to your daughter and trust between the two of you. That\u2019s not a small thing at all and speaks volumes for whether you can or cannot trust him to do right by your daughter if you ever become incapacitated. \n\nIf Joey complains about his daughter getting the new necklace point out that he himself claimed an Amazon necklace would \u201cmake up\u201d for not getting this one and implied there was not a difference between the two. \n\nOh, and if you\u2019re actually going to try to stay married to this buffoon (I wouldn\u2019t advise that) couples counseling is likely a must.

Even if you're with Joey now, you still have to co-parent with the ex, and he will still have to co-parent with his ex, biologically the kids are whose they are. It's no fault of the children at all, and just because you give the necklace to your bio daughter does not mean you are showing favoritism.
