Eventually she'll think of it as a loser's trophy.  It's none of anyone else's business like some kid is gonna be disrespected because someone else gave their kid a replacement trophy.

I normally dislike the idea of \"participation trophies\", and even as a kid I easily understood which trophies were actually worthless junk. However, the amount of effort you put in for your daughter made it a GIFT, and a celebration with people who care about her! You acknowledged that she worked hard and decided to reward her for it. It's okay to bend the rules once in a while to keep your kids spirits up. However, I would just be careful putting down the other paintings like that.

If this is something she enjoys and is passionate about, why not encourage and celebrate her hard work? If you didn't reward her as you did she may decide to give up what may be a hobby and/or a career she enjoys or is passionate about. \n\nNow, if you went to the school fought with them and forced them to give a trophy to everyone, that'd be a different story but you didn't.

It doesn't devalue the trophies my classmates might have won for their sports or extracurriculars because I didn't do those things to earn my trophy.

Not only is this true, but it is counterproductive to the emotional development of children. \n\nCurrent research on well-being in schools encourages a focus on the process rather than the outcome.

Can she ask the judges for feedback on how to improve her technique?\n\nShe\u2019s not going to become a successful artist (or anything really) because she was given a consolation prize for not winning.
