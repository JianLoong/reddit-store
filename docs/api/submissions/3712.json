Eventually she'll think of it as a loser's trophy.  It's none of anyone else's business like some kid is gonna be disrespected because someone else gave their kid a replacement trophy.

I normally dislike the idea of \"participation trophies\", and even as a kid I easily understood which trophies were actually worthless junk. However, the amount of effort you put in for your daughter made it a GIFT, and a celebration with people who care about her! You acknowledged that she worked hard and decided to reward her for it. It's okay to bend the rules once in a while to keep your kids spirits up. However, I would just be careful putting down the other paintings like that.

You're a good parent!", "NTA Art is subjective and I think encouraging her creativity is important. If this is something she enjoys and is passionate about, why not encourage and celebrate her hard work? If you didn't reward her as you did she may decide to give up what may be a hobby and/or a career she enjoys or is passionate about. \n\nNow, if you went to the school fought with them and forced them to give a trophy to everyone, that'd be a different story but you didn't.

But it's part of their growth to take their losses. You can let her know she's always a winner at home without going so far to make her think she always deserves a trophy.", "But then you are giving her a placebo to make her feel better instead of giving her tools to succeed in life. \n\nMy daughter and I have competed in many dance competitions. We didn\u2019t always agree with the judging, but I never gave her a fake trophy as a bandaid. I explained to her that there will always be someone better than us and life isn\u2019t fair. But strive to do your best and you will always be proud of yourself. Validation should first come from yourself and not necessarily be accompanied by a win. Failing and getting back up can be so much rewarding. \n\nYTA", "You can teach her recognition and support and praise without having to get a winners trophy. So you tried to teach her good lesson , but kinda threw in an extra bad lesson on top, that might have an impact on future times when she doesn\u2019t win.", "Then I guess I don't see anything wrong with it. It still feels odd, but not necessarily wrong.\nI'm glad the party made your daughter happy. : )", "I'm sure there is a bias here, OP's bias against art her kid didn't make.", "Art is subjective and I will admit it's wrong to have parental bias but encouragement is different from taking a loss rather than tell your child you tried but to encourage her love for Art the op isn't an asshole because she gave encouragement to her daughter at the end of the day realizing that you did your best and to keep trying is better learnt", "<3", "Yes and that\u2019s what she should have done. Instead she made a trophy and told her daughter they made the wrong decision. \n\nLife isn\u2019t fair, we all know this. I find that learning that younger makes it so much easier to go through life. Also knowing that she could work with the ideal to get better and not get that trophy, will help her daughter so much more. Then she can compete with herself and work on a healthy relationship with competition. To also enjoy art and get better at it.", "Well what's done is done as far as I'm concerned as long as the kid knows that she's being encourage in her endeavors, op did an ok job with the parenting"]}
