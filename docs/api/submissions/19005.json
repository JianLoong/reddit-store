My boyfriend and I have been in a longterm relationship for almost 10 years. We would love to get married, but we're working towards being financially stable enough to have the wedding we want. \n\n  \nLast week my friend had a wedding. There was only about 50 or so guests and it was only people the couple knew personally, so no plus ones. I was invited but my boyfriend wasn't. When i arrived i noticed that a lot of the adluts had a partner with them. It made sense to me because this friend is from quite a traditionalist background and the people in her community tend to get married quite early.\n\n  \nThe ceremony was lovely and went on without any problems. The issue came later with the bouquet toss. The bride made everyone stand around in a circle, she then told all the unmarried people to get in the middle. Immediately all the children (all under 10 years old) ran to the middle. No adults moved at all. It was in that moment that it really hit me that i was really the only unmarried adult at the wedding. The bride looked at me, pointed and told me i needed to get in the middle (she was tipsy at this point and was being really loud) and immediately everyone was looking at me.  \n\n  \nThis is where i may be an asshole because i know it's a bit overdramatic and sensitive, but in that moment i felt really embarrassed. I was expected to step into the centre of a ring of people and scramble for a bouquet with a load of little kids while everyone watched. It felt so humiliating and almost like i was being made fun of and singled out because i wasn't married yet, despite being in a relationship longer than most of the married people in the room. I would've had no problem doing this if there were other women my age also participating, but the fact it was just me and a load of small children made it feel very humiliating.\n\n  \nI did try to laughingly say no but i think everyone took that as me being nervous so i ended up getting shoved into the middle anyways. She tossed the bouquet and immediately the kids ran for it and one little girl ended up catching it, leading to some of the other kids crying. I was just awkwardly stood in the middle of it feeling really embarrassed. I ended up walking into the bathroom to cool off before leaving the reception early. The bride texted asking where i was. i lied saying i felt sick. I don't think she believed me because you could kind of tell how uncomfortable i was while i was there.\n\n  \nI went home and told my boyfriend everything and he empathised with me, saying it was rude for the bride to single me out in front of everyone. I later confided in my mum about it and she told me that i was being oversensitive and that the bride was just trying to have fun and didn't mean to single me out and that it was rude for me to leave early over it. I haven't heard anything from the bride and groom but i did notice that the bride has unfollowed me on instagram so maybe she also thinks what i did was rude.

Don\u2019t start me on a partner of 10 years being excluded because you don\u2019t have a piece of paper. In all other respects if you separated it would be a \u201cdivorce\u201d like any other just without the decree nisi\u2026\u2026..", "NTA \n\nFirst off, why could you not bring a plus 1 to this wedding if you are unmarried!? I am assuming the bride has met your SO many times considering you have been together a long time and she invited you to a small wedding. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have gone without my SO if we were years into a relationship. \n\nSecond, just because you are not legally married, does not mean you are single. If you did not feel comfortable going then your friend should not have made you go up there.", "NTA. You were singled out for being unmarried both on the guest list and at the wedding. \n\nPeople need to accept that not all relationships follow the same path, and it doesn\u2019t make them less valid. Your boyfriend should have been invited to the wedding alongside you and you shouldn\u2019t have been called out like that. It really feels like she was sending a strong message to you: \u201cGET MARRIED ALREADY\u201d", "NTA \n\nThat tradition needs to fade away altogether but her doing it when you were the only single adult in the room was an AH move from her", "NTA\n\nFirst, bf should have been invited since everyone else's \"plus ones' were invited. \n\nSecond, the bouquet toss should ALWAYS be VOLUNTEERS ONLY. Singling you out like that was extraordinarily rude. Refusing your initial 'No' even more so.\n\nThird, 'over sensitive' is the excuse of bullies & abusers everywhere. Don't buy into that.", "NTA - what did they expect you to do? Throw down to get the bouquet from 7 year olds?", "NTA\n\nDeliberately humiliating your alleged friends is not cool under any circumstances, and being tipsy is no excuse, nor is the fact that it was her wedding. Lots of people seem to think having a wedding is a license to be an asshole with no consequences, which is utter bs.", "NTA and your mom is clueless. The bride was absolutely trying to single you out. But your mom was right, she was just trying to have fun... at your expense, and that's just wrong. She was trying to embarrass you because she thought it would be funny, giving you no opportunity to bow out.", "NTA\n\nThere are many reasons why one would not want to participate in this.  \n\nDid they also do the garter toss, and the awful \"tradition\" of the single guy who catches the garter putting it on the woman who caught the bouquet?  Along with the whole bit about the higher he gets the garter on her leg, the longer the marriage will be?\n\nIf you're in a committed relationship, who would want some random guy feeling up your leg?  What would that do to your relationship? And if you aren't, who would want some random guy feeling up your leg?  \n\nJust because it is a tradition doesn't mean anyone has to participate.  If you aren't comfortable with it, for any reason, you should be able to quietly opt out.  \n\nSome wedding traditions are nice.  Others aren't.  Having an adult scramble to catch a tossed item with a bunch of kids isn't nice.  The kids are going to be fussy because most of them won't be getting the bouquet, and an adult who seriously pits themselves against children in such a contest is AH. An adult can, if serious, both more easily catch the item since they are taller with longer limbs, and can also physically hurt smaller children if they aren't careful.", "NTA\n\nThe bride definitely singled you out. I mean, she literally pointed at you and told you explicitly to go in the middle.", "You being single is not humiliating; the bride singling you out as the only single adult at a public event is humiliating. \n\nAnd her unfollowing you lets you know that she\u2019s unwilling to understand where you\u2019re coming from. Very selfish and immature behavior. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHorrible. Terrible thing to do to you. \n\nAt a soon-to-be ex-friends wedding at the age of 45, I refused the bouquet toss (many times leading up to the wedding) only to have the groom attempt to drag me to the floor from my seat. Problem was, I had wrapped my leg around a table leg and he and I ended up on the floor along with most of the table. And the desserts and the drinks. You get the picture. It was not the image she hoping for. \n\nCan't say I didn't warn them. \n\nThe actual bouquet toss was anti-climatic after that.", "NTA - it's a stupid tradition, same with the garter toss.", "NTA. The bride was being rude. Really, the whole bouquet toss for unmarried people just need to go away or include everyone (married or unmarried). She had no reason to single you out, except for maybe a laugh at your expense.", "NTA. The bride was TA. She shouldn't have forced you out there.\n\nAt my friend's wedding 30 yrs ago, this girl dive bombed for the bouquet", "NTA. Yeah that was rude. Been to a few weddings and I've never actually seen kids join in before though, that should've been how it remained as a fun little mini toss.", "NTA. I did not toss my wedding bouquet, instead I gave it to my Grandma as a thank you for helping to raise me. To me this tradition makes no sense and all it seems to do is embarrass people.", "NTA.\n\nBut What I absolutely hate about this is there is probably a narrative among the people who knew she left early, that she did so because she's probably so upset for not catching the bouquet.", "I'm going to go with NAH here instead of NTA. I'd say the bride was definitely inconsiderate, but what she asked wasn't AH behaviour. Neither was your reaction though!\n\nAll in all, it was just a sucky situation with seemingly no malicious intent on either side", "NAH, my friend had a similarly sized wedding with just a handful of kids, so when it came to the garter toss it was the groomsmen (myself included) and two kids. I was engaged to my now wife at the time (and she was present), but my friend asked me to come to and participate because I wasn't married yet, so I did. I didn't go for the garter at all, but I participated. My wife also participated in the bouquet toss, she also didn't go for the bouquet. That's all that was asked of you. You aren't an asshole for not wanting to participate, I get that it's embarrassing and weird when you're already in a long term relationship, but it's a common tradition and standing there not catching a bouquet on you friends wedding day isn't a big ask.", "NAH this is a normal tradition. I\u2019m sorry you ended up being the only unmarried adult but it\u2019s much better to just laugh about it with everyone rather than letting the embarrassment get to you. In my family, those who don\u2019t want to be \u201cembarrassed\u201d hide out in the bathroom when they hear it\u2019s coming up. I think you could have just handled it better and just had a laugh about it but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm surprised OP didn't storm out of there when it was clear the bride intended to hurt OP this way.\n\nIt's so ridiculous it looks like one of those parody posts they post in some troll subs. OP if it's a true story, you need to reevaluate your friendship and maybe your self worth and self respect. I mean, the friend had the audacity to block you for silently exiting her party without throwing a fuss, and you are still here looking to see if you should \"fix\" this.", "My step mom tried to push me out onto the floor at my niece's bouquet toss- even though my fiance was right there.", "That's what I thought that the bouquet toss was voluntary not an obligation. Not everyone wants to get married or wants to get trampled by other women or children to catch a bunch of flowers that are not a guarantee to be wed.", "Sadly,  I've actually seen this happen", "That\u2019s so odd. I\u2019ve never seen a bouquet toss with actual children. I guess if they marry early that\u2019s not strange for them\u2026", "It's 2023 - people are allowed to say no, and not be bullied into doing something that they don't want to do.", "alot of people seem confused on why i was upset. Its not because i'm in a longterm relationship and expect to be treated like i'm married, it's that it was just me and a load of children.", "If people need to hide in the bathroom just to avoid the embarrassment of the bouquet toss, then I vote to downgrade it from \"normal tradition\" status.", "It's not OPs wedding, if they don't want to participate they can just stand there and not catch the bouquet, it's a fair compromise that doesn't start a conflict in the middle of someone's wedding. They just happened to be the only single adult female and were embarrassed by that fact when it came out during the bouquet toss. It's not the brides fault that OP was embarrassed but OP is also not an asshole for feeling embarrassed and not wanting to participate.", "> it's that it was just me and a load of children.\n\nYeah I got that, but my point is who cares? Just walk up, stand there until one of the children grabs the bouquet, then walk away. It's not that big an ask and you shouldn't be embarrassed for being the only unmarried adult female in the room.", "It IS the brides fault that she was without her bf of 10 YEARS. She is NOT single. It's the brides fault for not taking NO for an answer. If there are no single adult females there - you  do not toss the bouquet. What is the point of it? To see who gets married next? So..... you have a bunch of little kids competing to see who gets married next?", "Well, clearly OP cared. And the bride and the people near her were not respectful of that. If it\u2019s not a big ask, why does it matter she didn\u2019t want to do it?", "> It IS the brides fault that she was without her bf of 10 YEARS.\n\nOP said they only invited close friends of the bride and groom because it was a small wedding, not that he wasn't invited because they weren't married yet. It's possible that's why he wasn't invited, but that's not what was started.\n\n> She is NOT single.\n\nI understand, I used single as shorthand for unmarried because it's way easier to get the Google keyboard to recognize \"single\" (one quick swipe) rather than unmarried (swipe, delete swipe, delete, giving up and typing the letters manually) while conveying the underlying point. OP was the only female adult up there.\n\n> It's the brides fault for not taking NO for an answer.\n\nThe bride just asked her to come up, OP said the crowd shoved her into the middle, not the bride.\n\n> So..... you have a bunch of little kids competing to see who gets married next?\n\nYes basically, the reasoning for the tradition doesn't matter to the kids they just want to \"win\".", "> And the bride and the people near her were not respectful of that.\n\nIt's the brides wedding, not OPs. OP wasn't singled out for this tradition to embarrass them, it just worked out to be that they were the only single adult female. Is it a weird and annoying tradition to participate in? Yes. Is someone else's wedding the place you should take a stand against outdated wedding traditions, absolutely not.", "i wasnt taking a stand, i said in the post i'd be fine doing it if other people my age were also involved", "I never said *you* were taking a stand, I said you were embarrassed because you were the only single female adult. The person I was replying to was basically suggesting that you shouldn't have had to participate if you were embarrassed, but that would have been taking a stand against the tradition at someone else's wedding."]}
