My boyfriend and I have been in a longterm relationship for almost 10 years. We would love to get married, but we're working towards being financially stable enough to have the wedding we want. \n\n  \nLast week my friend had a wedding. There was only about 50 or so guests and it was only people the couple knew personally, so no plus ones. I was invited but my boyfriend wasn't. When i arrived i noticed that a lot of the adluts had a partner with them. It made sense to me because this friend is from quite a traditionalist background and the people in her community tend to get married quite early.\n\n  \nThe ceremony was lovely and went on without any problems. The issue came later with the bouquet toss. The bride made everyone stand around in a circle, she then told all the unmarried people to get in the middle. Immediately all the children (all under 10 years old) ran to the middle. No adults moved at all. It was in that moment that it really hit me that i was really the only unmarried adult at the wedding. The bride looked at me, pointed and told me i needed to get in the middle (she was tipsy at this point and was being really loud) and immediately everyone was looking at me.  \n\n  \nThis is where i may be an asshole because i know it's a bit overdramatic and sensitive, but in that moment i felt really embarrassed. I was expected to step into the centre of a ring of people and scramble for a bouquet with a load of little kids while everyone watched. It felt so humiliating and almost like i was being made fun of and singled out because i wasn't married yet, despite being in a relationship longer than most of the married people in the room. I would've had no problem doing this if there were other women my age also participating, but the fact it was just me and a load of small children made it feel very humiliating.\n\n  \nI did try to laughingly say no but i think everyone took that as me being nervous so i ended up getting shoved into the middle anyways. She tossed the bouquet and immediately the kids ran for it and one little girl ended up catching it, leading to some of the other kids crying. I was just awkwardly stood in the middle of it feeling really embarrassed. I ended up walking into the bathroom to cool off before leaving the reception early. The bride texted asking where i was. i lied saying i felt sick. I don't think she believed me because you could kind of tell how uncomfortable i was while i was there.\n\n  \nI went home and told my boyfriend everything and he empathised with me, saying it was rude for the bride to single me out in front of everyone. I later confided in my mum about it and she told me that i was being oversensitive and that the bride was just trying to have fun and didn't mean to single me out and that it was rude for me to leave early over it. I haven't heard anything from the bride and groom but i did notice that the bride has unfollowed me on instagram so maybe she also thinks what i did was rude.

Don\u2019t start me on a partner of 10 years being excluded because you don\u2019t have a piece of paper. In all other respects if you separated it would be a \u201cdivorce\u201d like any other just without the decree nisi\u2026\u2026..", "NTA \n\nFirst off, why could you not bring a plus 1 to this wedding if you are unmarried!? I am assuming the bride has met your SO many times considering you have been together a long time and she invited you to a small wedding. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have gone without my SO if we were years into a relationship. \n\nSecond, just because you are not legally married, does not mean you are single. If you did not feel comfortable going then your friend should not have made you go up there.", "NTA. You were singled out for being unmarried both on the guest list and at the wedding. \n\nPeople need to accept that not all relationships follow the same path, and it doesn\u2019t make them less valid. Your boyfriend should have been invited to the wedding alongside you and you shouldn\u2019t have been called out like that. It really feels like she was sending a strong message to you: \u201cGET MARRIED ALREADY\u201d", "NTA \n\nThat tradition needs to fade away altogether but her doing it when you were the only single adult in the room was an AH move from her", "NTA\n\nFirst, bf should have been invited since everyone else's \"plus ones' were invited. \n\nSecond, the bouquet toss should ALWAYS be VOLUNTEERS ONLY. Singling you out like that was extraordinarily rude. Refusing your initial 'No' even more so.\n\nThird, 'over sensitive' is the excuse of bullies & abusers everywhere. Don't buy into that.", "NTA - what did they expect you to do? Throw down to get the bouquet from 7 year olds?", "NTA\n\nDeliberately humiliating your alleged friends is not cool under any circumstances, and being tipsy is no excuse, nor is the fact that it was her wedding. Lots of people seem to think having a wedding is a license to be an asshole with no consequences, which is utter bs.", "NTA and your mom is clueless. The bride was absolutely trying to single you out. But your mom was right, she was just trying to have fun... at your expense, and that's just wrong. She was trying to embarrass you because she thought it would be funny, giving you no opportunity to bow out.", "NTA\n\nThere are many reasons why one would not want to participate in this.  \n\nDid they also do the garter toss, and the awful \"tradition\" of the single guy who catches the garter putting it on the woman who caught the bouquet?  Along with the whole bit about the higher he gets the garter on her leg, the longer the marriage will be?\n\nIf you're in a committed relationship, who would want some random guy feeling up your leg?  What would that do to your relationship? And if you aren't, who would want some random guy feeling up your leg?  \n\nJust because it is a tradition doesn't mean anyone has to participate.  If you aren't comfortable with it, for any reason, you should be able to quietly opt out.  \n\nSome wedding traditions are nice.  Others aren't.  Having an adult scramble to catch a tossed item with a bunch of kids isn't nice.  The kids are going to be fussy because most of them won't be getting the bouquet, and an adult who seriously pits themselves against children in such a contest is AH. An adult can, if serious, both more easily catch the item since they are taller with longer limbs, and can also physically hurt smaller children if they aren't careful.", "NTA\n\nThe bride definitely singled you out. I mean, she literally pointed at you and told you explicitly to go in the middle.", "You being single is not humiliating; the bride singling you out as the only single adult at a public event is humiliating. \n\nAnd her unfollowing you lets you know that she\u2019s unwilling to understand where you\u2019re coming from. Very selfish and immature behavior. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHorrible. Terrible thing to do to you. \n\nAt a soon-to-be ex-friends wedding at the age of 45, I refused the bouquet toss (many times leading up to the wedding) only to have the groom attempt to drag me to the floor from my seat. Problem was, I had wrapped my leg around a table leg and he and I ended up on the floor along with most of the table. And the desserts and the drinks. You get the picture. It was not the image she hoping for. \n\nCan't say I didn't warn them. \n\nThe actual bouquet toss was anti-climatic after that.", "NTA - it's a stupid tradition, same with the garter toss.", "NTA. The bride was being rude. Really, the whole bouquet toss for unmarried people just need to go away or include everyone (married or unmarried). She had no reason to single you out, except for maybe a laugh at your expense.", "NTA. The bride was TA. She shouldn't have forced you out there.\n\nAt my friend's wedding 30 yrs ago, this girl dive bombed for the bouquet", "NTA. Yeah that was rude. Been to a few weddings and I've never actually seen kids join in before though, that should've been how it remained as a fun little mini toss.", "NTA. I did not toss my wedding bouquet, instead I gave it to my Grandma as a thank you for helping to raise me. To me this tradition makes no sense and all it seems to do is embarrass people.", "NTA.\n\nBut What I absolutely hate about this is there is probably a narrative among the people who knew she left early, that she did so because she's probably so upset for not catching the bouquet.", "I'm going to go with NAH here instead of NTA. I'd say the bride was definitely inconsiderate, but what she asked wasn't AH behaviour. Neither was your reaction though!\n\nAll in all, it was just a sucky situation with seemingly no malicious intent on either side", "NAH, my friend had a similarly sized wedding with just a handful of kids, so when it came to the garter toss it was the groomsmen (myself included) and two kids. I was engaged to my now wife at the time (and she was present), but my friend asked me to come to and participate because I wasn't married yet, so I did. I didn't go for the garter at all, but I participated. My wife also participated in the bouquet toss, she also didn't go for the bouquet. That's all that was asked of you. You aren't an asshole for not wanting to participate, I get that it's embarrassing and weird when you're already in a long term relationship, but it's a common tradition and standing there not catching a bouquet on you friends wedding day isn't a big ask.", "NAH this is a normal tradition. I\u2019m sorry you ended up being the only unmarried adult but it\u2019s much better to just laugh about it with everyone rather than letting the embarrassment get to you. In my family, those who don\u2019t want to be \u201cembarrassed\u201d hide out in the bathroom when they hear it\u2019s coming up. I think you could have just handled it better and just had a laugh about it but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, the bride didn't force OP to participate, from OPs own post:\n\n> I did try to laughingly say no but i think everyone took that as me being nervous so **i ended up getting shoved into the middle** anyways.\n\nThe bride wasn't shoving OP, the wedding guests did that, the bride simply asked OP to come up and catch the bouquet.", "So here's the thing. Presumably, she knew who she invited. She would know you were the only adult without a partner there.  You declined to be in the circle but were forced into it.  She knew you'd be the only adult in that circle.  Your feelings about it matter. Sure to some it may seem like no big deal. But for such a small wedding, it would seem like she would have known how you would feel about it.  This girl is not really your friend.   \n\n\nAnd if you felt really embarrassed about the not being married situation in that setting (which I don't think is necessary to do to yourself really) then perhaps on some level you wish you were married vs. waiting.

Regardless of where you are in the world it shouldn't take you more than 2-5 years tops to save up for a half decent wedding.\n\nI think you and your boyfriend need a conversation and you need to explain yourself to the bride.", "NTA!  That\u2019s so weird to have a bouquet toss knowing with the bride knowing there was only going to be one eligible woman to catch it.  \n\nDefinitely sounds like she was calling your relationship with your boyfriend out as not being legit until you\u2019re married.", "You should have caught the bouquet like a American football player in the end zone and spiked it hard on the floor. Woooo!\n\nAll seriousness though NTA. Regardless of relationship status or it being a wedding,  no means no so once you declined once that should be the end of it.", "NTA. This is why I didn\u2019t even have a bouquet toss or garter toss. I used to HATE doing them at weddings. We did a generation dance. Couples who wanted to participate (not forced) danced together on the dance floor and little by little the dj called out people based on how long they\u2019ve been together. The lasting couple was the couple who was together the longest. They got my bouquet and a present from us. They then gave us words of wisdom.", "NTA - the bride is clearly somebody who thinks that being married gives her a licence to be rude and almost evil.\n\nAs a single and happy child free person I've long been bored of people at weddings offering commiserations as though I've been denied something I wanted. Most weddings I go to, I feel pity for the couple but you're supposed to fake the belief that they will be happy (even if you know he's only marring her  because he finally found somebody who will give him the better end of the deal). This bride believes that being married is something all women want and now that she is married she can 'look down' on you in your tragicly single state and she did this as an almost 'blessing' that she hopes you will soon be as lucky as she is.\n\nShe had 50 people at the wedding and she had done the maths on this, even planned it.  I would have sat it out, reading something.  If she had dragged me into the centre of the circle, i would have let her bouqet land on the ground, not picked it up and perhaps even kicked it hard across the floor, wrecking it.  \n\nperhaps this friendship is doomed to die if you won't allow her be cruel to you", "You were being shoved!

You said no, and no one should have touched you, period.   \n\nI almost guarantee that if you have a conversation with the bride, to try and smooth things over, she\u2019s going to demand an apology for \u2018ruining her bouquet toss\u2019. I also suspect she unfollowed you as a passive-aggressive way of telling you she\u2019s upset, and that (she thinks) that you\u2019re in the wrong, so you should reach out. \n\nI\u2019d recommend you don\u2019t. You did nothing wrong - you simply refused to endure any more of her humiliation. This woman isn\u2019t your friend.

People don\u2019t respect long term relationships if you\u2019re not married or planning on getting married and your \u201cfriend\u201d is proof of that.

Instead, I had the florist create a bouquet that could be taken apart into four smaller bouquets.  Then  I gave them to my sister and sisters in law.  People need to stop this tradition.

They're just icky from start to finish. My future BILs wedding was a bit of a mess because I refused to be in the toss and my future husband was upset that I didn't want to do it.

I'd reconsider that friendship.", "Also, it was horrible that everyone had a plus one there, just not OP.", "That's what I did at my wedding...the bouquet toss was for the women who have ever been single.

So, when we were in our 20s, I always invited her when I went out, but she always said know. There were people that I had known for years that never met my wife. They'd always joke that I was lying about being married... you know, because single guys in their 30s make a habit of making themselves unavailable at parties. Though, I could see the virtue in it. You could talk to whoever without any pressure. I guess that was  pretty freeing.", "Yeah, I was confused by this post because I've always seen the intent be that anyone who isn't married goes out, regardless of if they're in a relationship or not. Maybe someone will propose, maybe a fiances situation with uncertain wedding dates will finalize the plans, whatever. It was never meant to be single people only, I thought", "That was the vibe I was getting, too.
