I\u2019ve known her for longer because we went to the same school and ended up in the same college. We have complete trust in each other and we love each other very much.\n\n\nBackground: 7 years ago, me and my cousin \u201cSam\u201d (also fake name, 15M back then) were very into drugs, which resulted in Sam passing away to OD. We were best friends and he was the closest one I had, he was my everything and still is. I never had such a strong connection with anyone since he died. I\u2019m still not over his death. I\u2019ve been clean ever since.\n\n\nConflict: my phone lockscreen is the picture of me and Sam from the day he died. It\u2019s just a selfie of us two together shirtless, nothing inappropriate or unpleasant. I keep this picture as a lockscreen ever since that day. Lana knew about the picture, but she never asked. I never told because I\u2019m not comfortable with talking about Sam. It\u2019s still a very sensitive topic for me.\n\n\nA few days ago, Lana put my picture as her lockscreen and told me about it. I said \u201ccool\u201d, not giving it a thought. The day after she asked me if I wanted to put her picture as my lockscreen, I said no. To be honest I didn\u2019t really want to elaborate, but I said that the picture I have now has a huge sentimental value to me. She asked me for details and I gently explained that it\u2019s a picture of me and my most favourite person ever who passed away very young. She was visibly upset and asked me if I don\u2019t love her. I said I love her and she\u2019s important to me, but I still can\u2019t get over Sam\u2019s passing. I also kindly asked her to drop the topic, noting that maybe one day I\u2019ll be ready to talk to her about it. She became even more upset and said that it\u2019s just a lockscreen pic and that I could change it for her. I told her to drop it again, she got mad and accused me of not loving her anymore.\n\n\nI feel like I was being an asshole towards her, but I also feel like she was too pushy in regards of my boundaries.", "created_utc": 1703013247, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m9ut5/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_lockscreen/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are both still very young and have much growing up to do but this \"you don't love me if you don't do xyz\" is a red flag of manipulation. I am not saying she is doing it maliciously but perhaps she was told it is customary for partners to have each other as their lock screens (my partner and I don't). Explain that this photo means the world to you and does not reflect your feelings for her and if she continues, then perhaps she is not ready to be in a steady relationship.", "NTA. She sounds very immature and insecure. You\u2019re 21 maybe date someone more mature she\u2019s 18.", "This might be the least AH post I've read on this sub. Strongest of strong NTA.\n\nI could see her being bothered if it was a picture of an ex or even just a female friend on your lock screen, but it's a picture of you and a male family member, one that you were very close to that died. She's WAY out of bounds on this one. A real one, after you told her the story, would have thought it was sweet.\n\n Keep the lock screen up in honor of \"Sam\"!", "**NTA** OP, it's your picture, it's your sentimental value, it's your phone. You have no reason to change it. \n\nUnfortunately, your girlfriend is a baby teenager, and they get strangely attached to nonsense little acts like lockscreens. \n\nIt's up to you whether or not you give her the full story, since that's probably the only thing that'll dissuade her from pressing the issue. \n\nOdds are she's going to press it, because, again- hormonal teenager. It's up to you whether or not you're willing to tolerate it.", "INFO: Have you even told her that it's your cousin?\n\nIf not, all Lana knows about the guy you're shirtless with is that it's a sentimental picture of your \"favorite person\" who passed away. Lana or others who see it may think that this is a picture of your old ex-boyfriend.", "NTA - sounds like she is being very childish, but likely coming from a place of insecurity.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a picture of another girl or something, it\u2019s something really sentimental and meaningful to you. If it\u2019s \u201cjust a lock screen pic\u201d she shouldn\u2019t care that it\u2019s not of her right? I hope she isn\u2019t this dramatic about everything.", "NTA, shes young and naive. You really do not have to elaborate if you already said how much it means to you and who he is.", "NTA. Not even close.\n\n\"You see me everyday and were dating but you don't love me because you don't put me on your phone as a lock screen.\" Please, that's insecurity at it's finest. Feeling threated by someone who's male, the same sex as OP, who's longer with us... That's a little crazy imo. This isn't an Ex girlfriend, some random girl he's friends with or a celebrity crush. It's someone who was his family who passed away to soon. He's honoring the memory of his beloved friend \"Sam\"", "NTA. If it arises again let her know how immature she is being. Lock screens are not a test of love.", "NTA. Firstly, I am sorry for your loss, and for this situation. It sounds like you did a good job briefly explaining why and having boundaries about how much you are willing to share. You do not have to share more yet, until you are ready. \n\nNow, onto your girlfriend. As other comments have said, she is young, and having her partner on her lock screen is clearly a big deal for her. Probably to show her commitment to you, and how proud of the relationship she is. Not saying you need to change yours, but you might want to let her know you acknowledge how big this was for her, your initial reaction of \"cool\" might have been underwhelming for her, when it is a big deal for her. Just a thought, you are still NTA. The relationship between your love for her and your phone lock screen is definitely a stretch too far, and I'm sure you can come up with another way to symbolise your love for her, which seems to be what she is seeking.", "She\u2019s an immature 18 year old", "NTA, actually, NAH, but she needs to grow up a bit.\n\nIt's not a photo of some pronstar or exgf.  It's you dead family member you still feel bad about.", "NTA i agree with others if it was an ex GF or something, but this seems like a real RED flag if she is this Possessive. i am married and me and wife have what ever we want as lock screen it doesn't mean we don't love each other.  like that you where open with her too best course for relationships is to be honest and open. but this sounds messy", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s insecure and young. \nI\u2019m married. My husband has me as his Lock Screen, I have my bunny that passed. He gets it. If your gf is basing your love on a Lock Screen and not on what you do together, you need to have a serious talk.", "NAH\n\nJust tell her the truth. And I think you could hang a photo of you and your cousin someplace close by as a reminder. If you truly want it as a reminder on your phone then so be it. Communicate what happened and why you're a better person because of your past. If she leaves you because you used to do drugs then she's not the right one for you. No need to divulge the worst things about it. But talk about it and open up.", "NTA- if it was a pic of an ex or a female friend I\u2019d get being upset. But it\u2019s your cousin. My grandpa was my lockscreen for a long time after he passed, and my fiance never took issue with that.", "NAH. You're entirely justified in your actions and words. Her desire to be on your lockscreen is normal (I personally think it's weird as heck and just roll with the default screen). \n\nShe's testing a boundary for sure, but not explicitly breaching the AH boundary IMO. I hope you're able to give her a \"teaser\" version soon if you're serious about the relationship. She'll think it's sweet, see your true colours, feel remorseful and back down. Even if this is a non-negotiable for you and your willing to end it, she'll still be left wondering forever why tf this photo was so significant unless the tiniest explanation is offered. She's perceiving it as you're afraid to publicly have your phone disclose your relationship status. For her it's akin to not wearing a wedding band. \n\nAgain, NAH. You'll find she does a 180\u00b0 when you're comfortable opening up. Good luck, sorry for your loss. I hope you find the closure you need.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe she will be more understanding.", "NTA me and my partner have been together for 2 years almost and our profile pictures on social media aren\u2019t both of us.
