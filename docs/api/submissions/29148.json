Id try to honor his memory that way.", "NTA it\u2019s very thoughtful of you to think your son\u2019s roommate. Sorry for your losses.", "Sorry for your losses. NTA and consider it as getting the roommate through the lease perhaps? I think it is wonderful you want to help his friend.", "WNBTA\n\nYou are able to do *whatever* you want with those funds. You are not obligated to give it to family, and I personally wouldn't. Especially to someone who has no plans to use it the way her mother said it would be used. \n\nIf it were me, I'd help the roommate out. He didn't ask to be put in that situation, and I'm sure he would appreciate it and be able to continue his studies worry free, until he finds someone else to share the bills with.", "NTA. It's your money. You have no obligation to give the money to your niece. It's kind of you to think of his roommate; your son's absence is having an impact on his life.", "NTA\n\nI would not, at this point, give money directly to your niece.  First, she's still a minor, and your SIL will have control of it.  Second, if she joins the military, she will not have an urgent need for it.\n\nSet up a meeting with your son's roommate.  Find out exactly what your son would have contributed to their shared housing.  Pay that part of the rent directly to the landlord - don't give a cash handout.  Be clear you're paying off the rest of the school year to meet the obligation your son had to the roommate, but not going further.  Or say that you'll pay for a certain amount of months (if it is a lease for the full school year, perhaps until the semester break) to buy the roommate time to find a new roommate.\n\nTake the rest of the money, and throw it into a separate account, to give to your niece down the line.  Give it to her when she needs it.  When she has to make the first deposit for an apartment, or when she leaves the military, to have a bit of a next egg saved up, or if a crisis comes up.\n\nThrow it into a trust account for your niece, with you as trustee, and with the money going directly to her should you die or become incapacitated, and any remaining money going to her automatically when she turns, say, 30.  Also set it up so that if something happens to your niece, any remaining money goes to a charity you and your niece choose together.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nETA: Do you have an estate attorney you are working with to settle your son's affairs?  Check to see what the laws are about leases in the name of someone who died, and also review your son's lease.\n\nI know some off-campus privately owned housing has separate leases for each tenant, so it may be that the landlord has the right to lease out your son's room separately, but can't evict the roommate for your son's nonpayment. \n\nAlso, did your cosign your son's lease?  If so, you may have a legal obligation to pay.  Figure this out before giving any money to your niece. \n\nYour son had obligations, and some of those obligations fall to his estate to meet.  E.g., if your son has a savings account, it may be required to pay the lease from that account.    A thing to sort out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTell your sister that when your niece gets accepted to college, you will pay what you can directly to the college, to cover tuition.  But only tell her after your son's estate is settled, and all obligations met.  Likewise for the rent - it shouldn't take long to settle your son's estate, but it's better to have that sorted before giving any money.  \n\nEvicting someone takes time.  The landlord can't, and won't, throw the roommate out of the apartment the moment that your son's half of the rent hasn't been paid for one month.  It may be better for that part of the rent to be late, even if you have to pay a late fee, rather than rushing things before it's all legally clear to you.", "Family is what you make it.\nIf the thought occurred to you to help him, he needs it. I am sure the connection is strong because he is continuing what your son could not. Seeing him succeed gives you a glimmer of hope for the future.\nYou have suffered so much loss. I commend you for thinking of others and caring about the effects of your actions. NTA, you are a thoughtful gentlman.", "You wouldnt be the Ah if you do what you feel best about doing, if in doubt you can ask yourself what your son would've wanted and go from there.   \nYour sister is kind of an ah for even thinking about asking for it though. It has nothing to do with her at all.", "WNBTA, although why 3 months of rent? The roommate can provide for himself. If anything maybe a month just to help him out, but he also shouldn\u2019t be dependent on you. In regards to the SIL, don\u2019t get pushed around. You have the money, decide what you feel is best and don\u2019t let anyone try and bully/persuade you into doing anything else l.

Your late son's roommate is as heartbroken and traumatized as  you are with your late son's passing, especially he was the first witness. His roommate will definitely benefit from not just rent but also therapy and other expenses he will need to cope with the grief and trauma he just went through.\n\nI'm very sorry for your losses, OP. I just read your post on the other sub. Your SIL is definitely an asshole for \"expecting\" you to pay your nieces college fund that she clearly doesn't need. The \"She's your family but the roommate is not\" card is such a selfish and heartless excuse.", "NTA at all. I think it is actually lovely that you\u2019d would think of the roommate, it\u2019ll be helpful for him in a much greater way than you holding it or giving it to SIL. By all means give some to your niece if you want to as well, that\u2019s your call but if she isn\u2019t going to college then maybe give it to her directly so she can use it, rather than it being in a pointless college fund (who controls that, by the way?) \nYou\u2019ll be giving the roommate time to grieve and find the correct person to move in with them and I think that\u2019s amazing.", "NTA\n\nWhat do you mean she WANTS? Who the actual f**k has the audacity to demand someone else's late wife's life insurance? That's one entitled demand! She has absolutely no say in what must be done with money that doesn't belong to her.\nOP, just because they're family doesn't mean they're entitled to any money you have, let alone money that you got because you lost a loved one, your niece doesn't even  WANT to go to college, it's not like she's broke and going around between family members beginning them to help her while working to raise money her self and studying for scholarships!\nSometimes we need to contribute to help family in an unexpected emergency, COLLEGE IS NOT AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY, they had so many years to save money, and while it's hard for many, what was there original plan? It's no like they could have expected your wife to die! What if you actually needed the money? What if you decided to save it? I think you choosing to help your son's friend is very admirable and surely it would make him proud, I'm sure the experience to be the first one to find his roommate, call an ambulance, and actualy wait not knowing if it was too late, the guilt that he didn't find him sooner, was just so traumatizing for him, and if he can't afford rent then I have the feeling maybe he couldn't go to a therapist to help him deal with this, also after what happen rumors will spread and it would be extra hard to find a roommate, so this guy ACTUALLY NEEDS your help, not like your niece that doesn't even want to go, what happens once she put her foot down and tells her parents she's not going? Who gets the money? Will you get it back? Won't you need to extra help the roommate not only to pay but to find a new place because he would have already been evicted by then.\nif you still would like to give her a small amount, then that's generous of you, but if your reason is that you wish to keep the peace, I don't think this will satisfy them and they will get upset over you giving your money to someone else.", "NTA, im so sorry for your loss. Id go with your split. Its your money, you can do what you like. And family is who we chose to have around, not neccesarily blood relatives. Tell your SIL that you gave your money to your niece but half of it was your sons money and he wanted it to be used to support his friend.\nShe cant argue with that.", "NTA. I\u2019d say this is incredibly fair to everyone due to a tremendously devastating circumstance.\n\nI\u2019m deeply sorry for your losses.", "NTA. I think it's a lovely idea. Kind and considerate, and I'm sure it would be appreciated.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money to spend as you like.\n\nYour niece doesn't need the money. Your son's friend seems to need it.", "Talk to niece and make sure she is joining army when her mother isn't around. If she does then army can help her with college fund if needed. Your decision will have been made for you. It's still your money to do with as you wish. Respecting the wishes of those you've lost is an honorable thing to do.", "How did your SIL know about the money you had left? NTA for wanting to help his roommate. He is probably in pain and struggling also.", "NTA - I would do that & I would be very vague with answering any questions that come your way from SIL. You want her to have the impression that is all the money, or she will never shut up about it.", "NTA. The kid needs it. Your niece, not so much.", "Definitely not. Your neice gets some, your son's friend gets some.\n\nAlso, I'm very sorry for your losses.", "If she lives in the U.S. the army could actually help pay for her college. NTA", "NTA. Your overall plan sounds good to me.", "I think you should give some money to your niece and the roommate. BUT put her share in a fund that she can\u2019t touch until she\u2019s 21 or something. Your wife knew and loved her niece and your son would want his roommate to be okay. Give to both.", "NTA.\n\nYour SIL is being awfully spendy with what is, in fact, YOUR money.", "Ywnbta and honestly what I would do is save some money for your niece as a boot camp graduation present and also help your sons roommate as well. But I would definitely give your niece the money in either cash or as a direct deposit into her military account that way her mother doesn't get ahold of it. Idk how her mom is taking her daughter wanting to enlist but she said she wanted her daughter to go to college so there could be some animosity there. The military will pay for her schooling if she decides to go to school at all so therefore she doesn't need a college fund at all.", "NTA.  Your son would have loved that you did this for his friend.  You are under no obligation to do anything for your niece or any other family members.  Do what your son would want.  I\u2019m so sorry for your losses.", "Do whatever give you the most peace.", "from the bottom of my heart , i'm so sorry . they are never really gone as long as you have all the memories . they are always and still with you .", "NTA  i think your heart is absolutely in the right place. This is not about obligation but need. The flatmate must be going through a hard time losing his friend.", "NTA, to whom you give money is your business and a DNA relationship should not be brought into it. You are kind man to worry about your son's friend. He may end up dropping out of school without this help. It sounds like your niece already has a college fund and may have GI bill money as well.  The other thing to look at is who has control of her college fund.  Is it your SIL?  If your niece makes a career of the military or her military training leads to a good job, will she get the money or will your SIL?", "I think you're a wonderful person for wanting to help his roommate. I think your SIL is to pushy though. Talk to your niece. I'm thinking her mom wants the money. I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my husband and son within a few years of each other. This is the worst club to be in", "No one is entitled to your money, family or not. You can do anything you like with it, including paying your son's portion of the rent. With that level of entitlement,  I'd give niece nothing.  NTA.", "Honestly, it's really none of your SIL's business how much money you have or have left!!!  \nNTA!!! Honor your son and wife!!", "I think that is a kind and generous idea. It will help his roommate immensely. I expect he is grieving too and this should be some comfort to both of you. I wish I could offer you more comfort than words.", "NTA\n\nHalf the rent for 3 months shouldn't be a lot of money anyway.\n\nI guess this wouldn't make a big difference for your nieces education anyway", "NTA. I'm sure your son's friend is not only grieving his loss, but also stressing out about the bills which in turn will make him feel worse for thinking about that while still grieving for your son. Definitely help him out until he can find a decent roommate.", "NTA, do what you want with your money.  Your mistake was letting in-laws know you have it but they aren't entitled to it in an sense at all.", "Do exactly as you please. Either way you are being generous. Your SIL doesn\u2019t get a vote.", "Sorry for your loss. NTa, but why is anyone expected to give life insurance money?", "NAH, I think you should divide the money in a way where it will do the most good for as many of your son's peers as you can, and tell your niece and his roommate that whatever they do with the funds, they must do in memory of your wife and son. I have read both of your posts and I didn't know how to respond to the one in TOMC, but I am glad to know leave you a message of condolences for your unfathomable losses, and wish you well in your grieving times to come.", "I wouldn\u2019t be discussing any of this with your family, it\u2019s just not their business how you\u2019ve spent or what you\u2019ve spent.\n\nI would say the moral obligation lies with the roommate and insurance is intended to ensure survivors are not put in financial stress. The roommate is a survivor and one your son would have fulfilled his obligation to first.", "NTA, the money is yours do do with as you choose. It\u2019s so unfair when people try to guilt other people into giving them money, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that on top of everything else.\nAlso, depending on where you live it\u2019s very possible that if your son and his roommate each signed their own lease (possibly even if they didn\u2019t) then as your son\u2019s next of kin you are responsible for paying his share of the rent anyway.", "He wouldn\u2019t have wanted his roommate to be evicted", "I don\u2019t have enough for the entire lease. I hope he can find someone else to share the bills with in 3 months", "There\u2019s no telling how long it\u2019ll take my son\u2019s roommate to share the bills with and it isn\u2019t his fault he was put in that situation. Hopefully he can find someone within 3 months", "The reason I mentioned my other post was because I can\u2019t say how Blaise really died and why I used Kim\u2019s life insurance money to pay for his funeral without this post getting taken down", "She\u2019s been passionate about the army since she was little. She\u2019s the deputy commander of the battalion or something in her jrotc program in school. If somewhere down the road she decides to go to college, she\u2019ll get a gi bill from the army if she stays long enough. If I give her any money, it would be for her to spend however she pleases.

I told her I still had some left over, which in hindsight I probably shouldn\u2019t have said", "I think helping his friend would be a lovely way to honor his memory. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Id do that. Plus your neice is going to the army as well.", "Then I think you know where to send the money. \n\nNTA", "Plus technically if there was a lease your son is still on it.

I\u2019m so sorry for your losses.", "Sometimes, we have to take care of the debt left behind by our loved ones. In this case your son made a promise to his roomate to pay half the rent while they lived together, it is perfectly valid to honour your sons memory by helping him keep his word to his friend/roommate for as long as possible and hopefully 3months should be enough time for your sons former roomate to find someone to take over your sons portion of the lease.\n\nI'm sorry for all you have been through.", "Roommate may get some help/relief if he talks to the apartment management and explains the situation.  Perhaps you could call them as well to help him that way. \n\nYour thought to help with his rent is generous and thoughtful.", "I understand. You have no obligation to tell the Internet everything that happened in details. \nWhat I wanted to say is that it's great that you thought of Blaise's roommate.
