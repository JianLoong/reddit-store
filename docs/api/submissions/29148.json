You are not obligated to give it to family, and I personally wouldn't. Especially to someone who has no plans to use it the way her mother said it would be used. \n\nIf it were me, I'd help the roommate out. He didn't ask to be put in that situation, and I'm sure he would appreciate it and be able to continue his studies worry free, until he finds someone else to share the bills with.", "NTA. It's your money. You have no obligation to give the money to your niece. It's kind of you to think of his roommate; your son's absence is having an impact on his life.", "NTA\n\nI would not, at this point, give money directly to your niece.  First, she's still a minor, and your SIL will have control of it.  Second, if she joins the military, she will not have an urgent need for it.\n\nSet up a meeting with your son's roommate.  Find out exactly what your son would have contributed to their shared housing.  Pay that part of the rent directly to the landlord - don't give a cash handout.  Be clear you're paying off the rest of the school year to meet the obligation your son had to the roommate, but not going further.  Or say that you'll pay for a certain amount of months (if it is a lease for the full school year, perhaps until the semester break) to buy the roommate time to find a new roommate.\n\nTake the rest of the money, and throw it into a separate account, to give to your niece down the line.  Give it to her when she needs it.  When she has to make the first deposit for an apartment, or when she leaves the military, to have a bit of a next egg saved up, or if a crisis comes up.\n\nThrow it into a trust account for your niece, with you as trustee, and with the money going directly to her should you die or become incapacitated, and any remaining money going to her automatically when she turns, say, 30.  Also set it up so that if something happens to your niece, any remaining money goes to a charity you and your niece choose together.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nETA: Do you have an estate attorney you are working with to settle your son's affairs?  Check to see what the laws are about leases in the name of someone who died, and also review your son's lease.\n\nI know some off-campus privately owned housing has separate leases for each tenant, so it may be that the landlord has the right to lease out your son's room separately, but can't evict the roommate for your son's nonpayment. \n\nAlso, did your cosign your son's lease?  If so, you may have a legal obligation to pay.  Figure this out before giving any money to your niece. \n\nYour son had obligations, and some of those obligations fall to his estate to meet.  E.g., if your son has a savings account, it may be required to pay the lease from that account.    A thing to sort out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTell your sister that when your niece gets accepted to college, you will pay what you can directly to the college, to cover tuition.  But only tell her after your son's estate is settled, and all obligations met.  Likewise for the rent - it shouldn't take long to settle your son's estate, but it's better to have that sorted before giving any money.  \n\nEvicting someone takes time.  The landlord can't, and won't, throw the roommate out of the apartment the moment that your son's half of the rent hasn't been paid for one month.  It may be better for that part of the rent to be late, even if you have to pay a late fee, rather than rushing things before it's all legally clear to you.", "Family is what you make it.\nIf the thought occurred to you to help him, he needs it. I am sure the connection is strong because he is continuing what your son could not. Seeing him succeed gives you a glimmer of hope for the future.\nYou have suffered so much loss. I commend you for thinking of others and caring about the effects of your actions.

His roommate will definitely benefit from not just rent but also therapy and other expenses he will need to cope with the grief and trauma he just went through.\n\nI'm very sorry for your losses, OP. I just read your post on the other sub. Your SIL is definitely an asshole for \"expecting\" you to pay your nieces college fund that she clearly doesn't need. The \"She's your family but the roommate is not\" card is such a selfish and heartless excuse.", "NTA at all. I think it is actually lovely that you\u2019d would think of the roommate, it\u2019ll be helpful for him in a much greater way than you holding it or giving it to SIL. By all means give some to your niece if you want to as well, that\u2019s your call but if she isn\u2019t going to college then maybe give it to her directly so she can use it, rather than it being in a pointless college fund (who controls that, by the way?) \nYou\u2019ll be giving the roommate time to grieve and find the correct person to move in with them and I think that\u2019s amazing.", "NTA\n\nWhat do you mean she WANTS? Who the actual f**k has the audacity to demand someone else's late wife's life insurance? That's one entitled demand! She has absolutely no say in what must be done with money that doesn't belong to her.\nOP, just because they're family doesn't mean they're entitled to any money you have, let alone money that you got because you lost a loved one, your niece doesn't even  WANT to go to college, it's not like she's broke and going around between family members beginning them to help her while working to raise money her self and studying for scholarships!\nSometimes we need to contribute to help family in an unexpected emergency, COLLEGE IS NOT AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY, they had so many years to save money, and while it's hard for many, what was there original plan? It's no like they could have expected your wife to die! What if you actually needed the money? What if you decided to save it? I think you choosing to help your son's friend is very admirable and surely it would make him proud, I'm sure the experience to be the first one to find his roommate, call an ambulance, and actualy wait not knowing if it was too late, the guilt that he didn't find him sooner, was just so traumatizing for him, and if he can't afford rent then I have the feeling maybe he couldn't go to a therapist to help him deal with this, also after what happen rumors will spread and it would be extra hard to find a roommate, so this guy ACTUALLY NEEDS your help, not like your niece that doesn't even want to go, what happens once she put her foot down and tells her parents she's not going? Who gets the money? Will you get it back? Won't you need to extra help the roommate not only to pay but to find a new place because he would have already been evicted by then.\nif you still would like to give her a small amount, then that's generous of you, but if your reason is that you wish to keep the peace, I don't think this will satisfy them and they will get upset over you giving your money to someone else.", "NTA, im so sorry for your loss. Id go with your split. Its your money, you can do what you like. And family is who we chose to have around, not neccesarily blood relatives.

Idk how her mom is taking her daughter wanting to enlist but she said she wanted her daughter to go to college so there could be some animosity there. The military will pay for her schooling if she decides to go to school at all so therefore she doesn't need a college fund at all.", "NTA.

The other thing to look at is who has control of her college fund.  Is it your SIL?

I'm sure your son's friend is not only grieving his loss, but also stressing out about the bills which in turn will make him feel worse for thinking about that while still grieving for your son. Definitely help him out until he can find a decent roommate.", "NTA, do what you want with your money.  Your mistake was letting in-laws know you have it but they aren't entitled to it in an sense at all.", "Do exactly as you please. Either way you are being generous.

I do hope you look after yourself as I'm sure both your wife and son would want you to carry on and try to wring some sort of happiness out of life in the future. I too agree with most of the comments here. I think it would be a lovely tribute to your son if you helped his room mate out, he's probably struggling to come to terms with what happened too, although obviously nowhere near what you are going through.  As for the niece, once she joins up she will have everything taken care of, food, board etc will all be available for her so I don't believe she will really need anything from you or be reliant on you for anything.  I also think it's a bit tacky of her mum to even ask.", "I am so so sorry for your loss. Your SIL is totally out of line asking you to do that.

Keep the money under your control, do not donate it to any fund not under your control such as the college fund, if you believe your niece will not go to college. If she does not go, you will have the freedom eventually to help her financially in a different way (house deposit, car, whatever), without influence by other parties, and thus prevent the money being used in a way you do not approve.\n\nSecondly, offer your sons friend an offical loan for these last few months (ensure you have official paperwork for this), intrest free, with a long return date (for instance 25 dollars a month for however long is required to repay the amount), to get through the year without losing his apartment.\n\nIf eventually it shows that your niece does not go to college, you can still tell the friend that he does not have to repay the remaining amount that has not yet been returned, this way you have helped your sons friend get through the remaining year, and your SIL cannot complain either since your eventual plan is still to use the money for your niece.", "NTA- Your wife left that money to you. It\u2019s your decision to spend it as you see fit. I think it\u2019s kind and generous of you to help your son\u2019s roommate and I hope he appreciates it. You are right that your niece doesn\u2019t need it. If she goes into the Army they will likely pay for college if she wants to go later.
