(and by falling outs I mean she started actively hating, being mean to, telling others to not be their friend...all over things that had no logical basis for getting mad over- she actually got mad at me for thowing out her mini fridge that had been broken for half the year and hadn't had the moldy food removed! I took care of her fish though)\n\nAnyway, rant over...if she has no good reason for the falling out with jane, then shes just a bitch and she will eventually turn that back on you more than she already has. I'd say cut Kate out of your life were it not for the bf/brother complication.", "You're 24.  You can be friends with whomever you want to be friends with.  You don't need Kate's blessing.  If she doesn't like Jane, that's fine.  She doesn't have to hang out with her.  But she doesn't get to dictate who you like to hang out with.\n\nYes, it's probably going to be awkward being around Kate now.  But that's on her, not you.  Set your boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nKate has absolutely no right to dictate who your friends are or should be. \"Over-dramatic and manipulative\" are traits that don't make for a good friend.\n\ni'd be removing Kate from your friend group if I was you", "NTA. Unless Kate gives you a good reason for why you should not hang out with Jane, she cant get to dictate who you are friends with. \n\nYou can still hang out with both the way you were doing now, keeping them separate from one another.", "NTA.  Kate doesn't have the right to approve your friends.  If she is abusing you for being friends with someone she doesn't like she is not your friend.", "NTA. But I'm wondering why you're even still friends with Kate? Unless she and her brother are conjoined twins, you CAN avoid her.", "NTA. Kate sounds terrible. No one gets to dictate who someone else is friends with. I thought we all learned that in middle school.", "You are NTA and maybe you should reconsider your friendship with Kate. Maybe she has a really good reason to hate Jane, but why she didn't tell you? And in any case her behaviour is pretty terrible: forcing one friend to leave behind the other without explanation is horrible, verbally abuse them when they disagree is even worse. I hope this will not jeopardize your relationship with your BF, but if he is understanding and mature he'll see you are right to stand by Jane and don't give in to Kate's bullying.", "NTA Kate sounds very toxic. Just because she is your bf's sister doesn't mean you have to be friends with her.", "As of right now we\u2019re not friends because of how she\u2019s treating me if things got better the most I would be is cordial to make things easier on the rest of the family no matter if she apologizes or not I can\u2019t forget that she tried to get him to break up with me", "Luckily for me he thinks for himself even though she did try to get him to leave me"]}
