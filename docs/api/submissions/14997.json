About a year ago, I found out that my husband, Tom, had been cheating on me.\n\nMy close friend Sarah told me one day on person with picture evidence at a local bar. It was an easy and quick divorce since we had only been together for 2.5 years total (quick and dumb I know).\n\nNow about 6 months after the divorce Sarah suggested her and I take a single girl trip to Italy with her and that it was $7,000 per person for the whole week for June of 2023. I didn\u2019t have the money at the time but she covered me and wanted me to pay her back last week. \n\nWell turns out for the past 5 MONTHS (as of today) she has been sleeping with my ex husband Tom. I found out after my other friend Clair told me they had been keeping the relationship a secret the whole time.  Why she didn\u2019t tell me sooner? I don\u2019t know. \n\nInstead of confronting Sarah i waited until she asked me to pay her back and I just told her she can take Tom! Well she didn\u2019t like that answer because I KNOW my ex husband is a deadbeat and doesn\u2019t have any money. Well she told me a majority of it is non refundable like the flights that are in my name and I told her tough luck shouldn\u2019t have lied behind my back. \n\nNow half my friends are telling me to pay her and just go do my own thing while the other half are supporting me. I kinda feel bad footing her with such a bill because I know she used her credit card since she didn\u2019t have that much cash at the time. \n\nSome of my friends suggested still going and still not paying her back, I have the boarding passes etc but I don\u2019t know if I should go that far. \n\nAITA for footing her the bill?", "created_utc": 1681706375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12p2ahf/aita_for_making_my_friend_pay_7000_for_my_portion/", "score": 552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is that situation.", "NTA\n\nIf you can afford it, I\u2019d recommend use the flights, pay for those.*\n\nGet your own hotel and look into guided tours to walk around museums and tourist things etc, make a friend in the group and go for meals with the new friend.\n\nYou\u2019ll have a brilliant time and Sarah will just be a piece of the past.\n\n*if you\u2019re not going to use the flights stick to the original story that you never would have agreed to go on vacation with the dip for your ex\u2019s wick, you don\u2019t have to honour an agreement extracted from you based on lies", "You\u2019re an asshole, but in this case you have every right to be", "Of course you\u2019re TA. Your deal was not paying her back as long as she wasn\u2019t sleeping with Tom. She can likely sue you for this money too. What she did is not right, but nor is what you are doing.", "Not the ah!!! Sarah is no friend, let her ass take Tom.", "From my perspective, not the A hole", "NTA\n\nSarah is a dumdum for not considering the possibility of her dirty little secret coming out. Also she's a traitor, she gets what she gets", "Don\u2019t pay back", "NTA this 'friend' deserves it for the level of betrayal - it's not like OP is just being petty, no one would go travelling with someone after suddenly finding this out about them. The friend is insane", "ESH. Stealing 7k as a revenge is not ok.", "Well deserved revenge.

Sometimes it's ok to be an AH.", "Also, I think Sarah is guilty as f\\*. I love my friends, but there is no way I'm willing to get 7000$ in debt for them. I would suggest a cheaper option or waiting a bit until OP could pay.... I think that the whole trip was just Sarah having guilty conscience.

I am also curious to know, was he in fact cheating with a third woman and Sarah caught them, and if so, why TF did she think OP's sloppy seconds were a good idea?", "Exactly.", "Yeah I thought of this too. Either way, NTA OP. Sarah made a poor investment. You shouldn\u2019t lend someone large sums of money that you\u2019re actively fucking over. It was a risky gamble and unfortunately, she lost. Oh well. People lose a lot more money for far less justifiable reasons. She\u2019ll get over it.", ">Any nonsense about him being your ex is ridiculous: friends don't fuck their friend's ex.

Who wants to travel with a \"friend\" who is fucking their ex shortly after the divorce? NTA", "This isn't a hard situation to judge. The woman is sleeping with her cheating ex husband. At that point any and all harm coming her way is her own fault.", "Flights are very expensive nowadays.", "99.99999% certain that it's actually \"$7000 for two people, and maybe Sarah can stash a couple thousand of that as a consolation prize if OP finds out the truth while still taking the vacation on her dime.", "ESH, OP, you are a A-hole with lots of (good) pride. This level of treachery is really unfathomable. \n\nThis person is not a friend. They never were if they could be this shady. \u201cFriend\u201d probably did set up the original cheating pic. But.

Think of it as damages for fucking your friend\u2019s (ex - though probably even before then) husband.\n\nPlus, reads to me that it\u2019s non-refundable and it\u2019s already in her name. I doubt he could go with her even if they wanted to.", "F being seen as \u201cthe financial bad guy.\u201d Sarah is ducking her ex-husband\u2014 that\u2019s worse! Social media accounts can be blocked. This notion that the wronged party has to swallow all of this bullshit is toxic as hell. Why does OP have any need in taking the high ground? Why does not accepting some lying backstabber\u2019s require a higher ground? \nConsequences and repercussions. Fuck around literally and find out.", "I disagree. Sarah knew what she was doing and justified her terrible actions while still trying to keep her friendship.", "it was 7 months after the divorce  \nOP said the trip was booked a year ago after the divorce and the friend was fucking her ex for 5 months", "according to OP's post she didn't start sleeping with the ex until 7 months after the trip was booked", "Not sure I agree on that statement when it comes from the person who reported the cheating ending up dating the X. \n\nTimeline seems to be report cheating immediately jump into bed with him.", "Ummm it isn\u2019t cool to sleep with your friend\u2019s ex husband. At all.", "From what she wrote, it sounds like her \"friend\" only told her that he was cheating so they would break up and she could jump on him. It was less than a month after they broke up. Call me cynical but I think she was the one who he was cheating with and she wanted him for herself.", "I\u2019m unsure of that, Claire only told me when she found out about the relationship. It could have been longer but I\u2019m trying to not speculate.", "Eh, from a financial responsibility point of view both Sarah and the OP are assholes.

Lesson to learn here is that there are some things you will do even if it makes you an asshole too.", "That's the problem with this sub.

Blown!", "Yes", "This was my thought, assuming we are talking from USA. 14 k sounds high for one week for 2 people but I\u2019m too poor right now to drive to the amusement park 45 minutes away right now, so what do I know. \n\nSarah, peach that she is, may lose out on the plane ticket cost if it\u2019s not transferable ( and it actually may be ) but she should be able to change her accommodations. June is still a while off. Cancelling and finding a cheaper place is a thing. \n\nAlso, how can OPs friends tell her to go and do her own thing?  Where are they staying? Sharing a room or a house?  That would be super awkward. \n\nThis is a grey area but I\u2019m going to say NTA    If you knew Sarah was banging your ex, you would never have agreed to go. Sarah needs to sort this in her own and OP needs to tell any friends they share who say she\u2019s a jerk for not paying to get bent.", "Flights from NZ would cost almost $6k if flying economy so maybe I'm not sure how much hotels etc cost in Italy though", "I fly pretty frequently and tickets are expensive, but not that expensive. Just checked: a LAX to Rome return flight is around $800-$1000. If they fly 1st class it\u2019s higher of course. Or if they\u2019re flying form Hawaii.

I don\u2019t understand.", "I do think it's a bit sleazy of Sarah. But that still doesn't give OP a voice in any of it. She opted out of any control over what that man does when she signed divorce papers.", "I think it depends on why he's an ex, some remain friends after divorce and would be ok with the other dating a mutual friend. However, in that case, they wouldn't be keeping it a secret, either.", "I mean it really doesn't matter, does it. You just don't start sleeping with your close friends' ex husband , especially if you know that man to be a good for nothing cheater. It's a massive betrayal of trust, and what is her prize?

If I didn't cheat and somebody lied about me to my partner in order to break up my marriage, I sure wouldn't want to date that person immediately after my divorce.
