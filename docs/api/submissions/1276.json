We were playing 8ball which we both happen to suck at. We also apparently don't understand the rules of 8ball because we had both gotten all of our colored balls in and then did not understand why neither of us had won yet. We were stuck on the part where you have to legally get the 8ball in after. After just shooting the white ball into the holes for a few minutes my wife suggests that maybe we are supposed to get the 8ball in. However, because we are both competitive, neither of us were willing to do it incase it was risking us losing. My wife and I had agreed that no matter who won this round that we would say it was a tie since we did not understand how the last round worked. Eventually, I got tired of shooting the white ball back and forth and decided to google what we were supposed to do. When I had learned that my wife's suggestion was correct and we did in fact need to shoot the 8ball in, I had stated I was going to win right before getting the 8ball in. The screen popped up saying I had won and I began bragging. This upset my wife because as I had mentioned, we agreed that we would say it was a tie but I changed my mind since I had won.

If you\u2019re both competitive, then at least learn the rules to compete by first.", "ESH because this doesn't matter even remotely. You shouldn't be smug about it because you didn't win, you googled how to do it, but she's bitter about something so incredibly unimportant. Take up a different hobby.", "YTA You cheated when you didn't told your wife the rules and she was right. I mean you didn't actually won. I don't understand people who cheats AND brags about that \"win\". That is not a true win. Also you are a bad 'winner\".", "ESH for taking a game and being stupidly competitive about it.", "NTA, she could have googled it as well and you just beat her to it."]}
