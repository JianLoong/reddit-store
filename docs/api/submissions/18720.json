I proposed to her about 5 months ago. We have the wedding planned for early September. We\u2019ve basically planned everything out by now and payed for a lot of things.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has never had a good relationship with her mother. Her moms very racist to me and cut her off after she introduced us. She hadn\u2019t spoken to her mom in nearly 6 years until she found out from an aunt that her mom was in multi organ failure(from drug and alcohol addiction) she isn\u2019t eligible for any transplants but can\u2019t leave the hospital. She\u2019s on like a hospice care plan in the hospital. My fianc\u00e9  has been spending more time with her and since she\u2019s heavily sedated she\u2019s calmer and nicer than usual.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is now saying that she doesn\u2019t want to get married without her mom and she saw some clips of hospital weddings online. She really wants us to get married inside her moms hospital room. Her mom will still barely talk to me and there\u2019s no way she\u2019d be okay with the Hindu preist we\u2019ve hired.\n\nAlso, we were both so excited for this wedding. My family has always treated her well and Indian weddings are very traditional and important. My mom and her planned this whole wedding together(and my mom helped pay) and although she\u2019d probably understand, I don\u2019t want to just cancel the wedding on her. And most of the things we\u2019ve purchased are non refundable.\n\nI\u2019ve said to my fianc\u00e9 that I think it\u2019s a bad idea, maybe we could have a ceremony in her room or something like that but still also have the wedding. But she says she doesn\u2019t want her mother to die before she\u2019s married and she wants her mom to really be there to make up for lost time. I feel like she\u2019s not thinking clearly because of how much she\u2019s grieving right now and she\u2019ll regret it later. Also her mom said that if we do get married in her room my 8YO daughter can\u2019t be there (because she\u2019s half black)\n\nI just don\u2019t want to give up my whole wedding with my family for someone who wasn\u2019t even going to be invited. I\u2019m still willing to compromise but I feel like an AH for not just doing it since she\u2019s going through so much.

That's just...wow. I don't care if she's dying that's despicable.\n\nYour wife is clearly grieving and your solution to have a small ceremony in the hospital room is completely appropriate (in addition to the big family ceremony).  If your wife is okay with not allowing your daughter to be there that's a whole other problem. A big one.\n\nI know she's trying to appease her mother but she's doing so at the expense of your daughter. She's not thinking how this one act will effect your daughter now and in the future. This is not okay. I really hope she is able to see clearly how wrong this is.\n\nIt's not just your wife's wedding, it is yours also. You shouldn't have to give up everything, you can do both. I would definitely force the issue with the hospital room ceremony though - if daughter can't be there then it's an absolute no.", "NTA\n\nThankfully, this is one of those problems where you can just procrastinate and it will solve itself.", "NTA:  I'm never one to say end a relationship but seriously consider if this would be the only time she would just want to deal with being discriminated against.

She's trying to make the most of the time she has left with her mother, and is probably already grieving. ASIDE from the racism (lol but who can put racism aside?), doing this would not mean you need to cancel the wedding you've already planned. This would more akin, perhaps, to a small ceremony relating to the marriage license as some people do at town hall, before the 'big' event. Still though, I think your fiancee will have to sadly accept that despite her strongest wishes, her mother is VERY unaccepting of you, and it's not practical, reasonable, or fair for her to expect you to participate in that.", "You could have a commitment ceremony at the hospital? Its a reasonable compromise IMO because its words without the music and should fulfill your GF's desires to reach out to her mom?\n\nNTA. I would never look at that woman again.

It sounds like she has a complicated relationship with her sorry excuse for a mother. It's still her mother and it can be difficult to navigate feelings like this at milestone events.\n\nBut canceling your actual wedding and EXCLUDING your daughter shouldn't even be an _option_. I am appalled that your s/o would even _entertain_ excluding her. This wedding isn't just about you and your s/o- your daughter is too. Yall are becoming a _family_ and the big wedding you're planning is to celebrate that. \n\nTalking as a step parent please for the love of all things holy _do not marry this woman if she thinks it's okay to exclude your daughter BECAUASE OF HER SKIN COLOR_. \n\nYou and your daughter deserve more.

Why should all wedding activities solely be focused on one woman, and everyone else who is effected by the marriage be ignored---particularly for a  woman who has treated you badly (and has treated her daughter badly as well)?\n\nI don't like ultimatums in general. But when I got to the lines where you say that if you do a marriage in the hospital you can not have a Hindu priest and worse, that your daughter will be excluded you need to take a stand. If your fiance is okay with her mother including those conditions then maybe it's time to put the wedding on hold in favor of doing some serious couples counseling.\n\nGood luck and let us know how it goes.", "NTA.  This is rough.  She's torn between the new feeling of being connected to her mother on a more normal level (probably for the first time in her life), knowing their time is very limited and wanting to include her in her wedding before she dies.  Can you have two ceremonies, one in her hospital room with very very limited attendees and your traditional wedding?", "NTA.\n\nDoesn't sound like the wife is thinking correctly. She could be dealing with a tremendous amount of guilt, even if it isn't warranted. Your offer of a bedside ceremony and still having your planned wedding in September was a completely fair, even an exceedingly generous, compromise, especially considering you'd be going to this extra effort to accommodate someone who has been openly bigoted to you *and* your child.\n\nI strongly suggest therapy for your wife. As soon as possible. Grief can start well before a death actually occurs. And considering the history, your wife is probably going through things she can't even grasp at the moment.", "NTA \nShe doesn't respects you and is racist about you and your daughter\nYour fiance should also consider her choices tbh she is just going through the pool of emotions NGL she is acting bit impulsive", ">I just don\u2019t want to give up my whole wedding with my family for someone who wasn\u2019t even going to be invited\n\nThen don't.

But, I honestly don\u2019t see your marriage lasting. It seems like this is important to your fianc\u00e9e and her grieving process.

Tell your partner there\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re getting married without your daughter\u2019s presence, and that you think it\u2019s best to postpone the wedding, potentially indefinitely if your partner won\u2019t stick up for your daughter", "YTA for marrying someone so disrespectful and awful.

If you\u2019re willing to do it, i think a compromise in this instance would be a generous and kind thing for you to do (going ahead with your planned wedding and having a ceremony and celebration at the hospital too, maybe even having the hospital ceremony first to appease her) - provided that your daughter is not only allowed to be present but also made to feel welcome by your fianc\u00e9es mother.

Under normal circumstances I\u2019d call your fianc\u00e9 TA for not calling her mom out on not allowing your daughter there (because truly, that was absolutely awful), but grief makes us not see clearly.\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to have a wedding in a hospital with a racist dying woman, and you shouldn\u2019t have a wedding without your daughter there. That\u2019s not a good way to start your lives together.\n\nBut your fianc\u00e9 is grieving and probably panicking a little because she has no time to think things through right now, so she may need grace if she\u2019s not thinking clearly.\n\nI\u2019d suggest talking with her specifically about your daughter, and the fact that you understand her wanting to honor her mom\u2019s wishes because family is important, but you two are starting a family together and it wouldn\u2019t be right to do it without your daughter.\n\nI\u2019d also suggest maybe compromising on something like just spending more time with her awful mom for her sake.\n\nFinally, just prepare yourself for the fact that the next few months might be rough, and build a support system for yourself. Losing a parent is rough, and living with someone dealing with that kind of grief is rough.

Maybe you can sway your fianc\u00e9 by saying it would be a bad omen to do this in the hospital. If not just it give it space. Your fianc\u00e9 is obviously going through a lot with the wedding planning and this family issue. This cannot be what she really wants and must be a need to make amends with mom.", "NTA. Your future MIL is not a nice person and on her deathbed is still trying to dictate her daughter's life. \n\nFrom your comments,  it doesn't sound like they have ever been close or had a good relationship. Likely your bride-to-be is grieving the relationship she never had (and never will).", "NTA. I think you and your wife should talk to a therapist or a grief counselor. This is a really complicated situation and I bet she\u2019s experiencing all kinds of strong, conflicting emotions about her mother and their relationship and the relationship she wishes they\u2019d had. Your wedding and your marriage have unfortunately gotten tangled up in that. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly understandable that you wouldn\u2019t want to give up celebrating with your family to have a hospital room wedding for a woman who doesn\u2019t accept you or your child. But if you refuse and her mother dies and doesn\u2019t get to see her married and she hasn\u2019t had someone to help her process it all, she might take out some of that grief and guilt on you. I think having a professional, neutral party to help you both work through it would be really helpful.", "NTA \n\nTell her if you guys don\u2019t have the wedding you planned, there won\u2019t be one. Your daughter not being allowed because she\u2019s half black?? WTAF is wrong with your fianc\u00e9e? We need to make up for lost time by being with her as much as possible, so she can emotionally abuse us until she dies. Jfc!", "NTA. I feel sorry for your fianc\u00e9 but this is insane. Forbid your CHILD from the ceremony? I would refuse under any circumstances. May she burn in hell.", "NTA. You haven't interfered with her spending these last days with her mother, despite the mother continuing to be a racist asshole. You have simply drawn the line at catering to the racist yourself. That's fair.\n\nBut I think you really need to think harder about whether this is the person to spend the rest of your life with, and force your child to spend years with. Someone who is willing to indulge the remainder of her childhood with. Someone who is willing to indulge a racist? Someone who is willing to exclude her future stepdaughter who is a WoC? That's your Ms. Right?\n\nI think she has revealed something important about herself, and it would be imprudent to sweep this new knowledge under the carpet. The wedding is where the three of you become one family. It should be beyond unthinkable to exclude your daughter from it. If your financee is willing to throw your daughter under the bus on such an important day, don't you think she'll be untroubled about doing it again in the future?  This isn't about where a wedding is held, it's about what kind of person your financee is when push comes to shove. You deserve better. Your daughter deserves better.", "Hold on\nYour fianc\u00e9 is okay with excluding your daughter to appease her racist mother ? And you still want to marry her?\nGrief or no grief, that is unacceptable that your wife is willing to do that. I would let your daughter or yourself in her moms presence. Your fianc\u00e9 is deluded. So how is she going to treat your daughter in the future when she wants to appease a racist person at the detriment of your poor daughter.\nNta but I would reconsider this marriage and a hard no on getting married for your wife\u2019s racist mom. Its a hill to die on", "NTA. Tell her its the original planned wedding or no wedding at all. You should not be forced to cater to a racist regardless of extenuating circumstances.", "Nta. If people can't come cause they are half black would be a big hell no to me. She cut her off cause she's racist and now she's making demands? Sorry but you're are getting married too, you have a say.", "NTA. The mum is racist and unkind, your wife is grieving but it\u2019s madness to indulge this", "Your child can't be there because she's half black...and your fiancee is okay with that.... \nI get that this is a hard and difficult time for her, but wow! Okay... I have nothing, sorry. \n\nNTA", "Nta so racist grandma doesn't want fianc\u00e9's soon to be child there and that's not enough to wake her up?\n\nAt the *very* most, and I mean it as a 'I am doing this favor for you bc dieing or not your mother is an absolute ahole' you could have a second western style ceremony there.", "NTA. What a shitshow.", "NTA- because -\n\"Also her mom said that if we do get married in her room my 8YO daughter can\u2019t be there (because she\u2019s half black)\"\n\nYour daughter not being there isn't optional", "NTA\nShe is grieving \nIt's really sad hw your wedding has been planned by her and your mum, her own mum not involved.\n\nShe's going to lose her mum. And she is going to lose any hope of having the mother daughter relationship she wants - that's likely what she is trying to salvage a piece of now, because soon there will never be a chance of repairing it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine to refuse.", "NTA.  For the racism alone.  Excluding your daughter -- again racism.  A wedding is about both parties. the compromise of a ceremony in the room and then going forward with your wedding is the best idea, honestly.", "NTA. Seriously? She\u2019s on her death bed & still trying to be racist & exclude your kid? Honestly, if your fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re not up for that, I wouldn\u2019t marry her.", "I don\u2019t feel like I can judge this\u2026\u2026 but I will say this: even if you officially marry in the hospital room, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have the wedding\u2026 my fianc\u00e9 and I are getting married in 3 months, we\u2019ll be traveling across the country to get married in my Home state. His grandfather is unable to travel because of his health. So we got \u201cmarried\u201d in his living room, so that he could be there. Granted the official/legal wedding isn\u2019t for three months, but his grandfather got see him get \u201cmarried\u201d. And that\u2019s all that mattered. There are ways to accommodate your situation if you want to.. although I totally get it if you don\u2019t want to, she\u2019s racist, and she brought your child into it\u2026 that\u2019s messed up. Good luck is all i can say.", "NTA But you will be the asshole if you go through with this marriage!\n\nYour daughter is half-black, how do you expect a women who is currently comfortable with her being discriminating against because of the colour of her skin, to love and support her through the discrimination & racism that she will surley face?!\n\nHow do you expect your soon-to-be wife to do the same for you?!", "Nta I'd do both a ceremony with her mother. But keep your wedding your traditions are a part of you and I wouldn't give that up", "NTA\n\nSooo let me get this straight\u2026 you fianc\u00e9 is okay canceling your planned wedding, and excluding you daughter so you can have the ceremony in her racist mom\u2019s hospital room??\n\nHard pass.\n\nEverything else aside, I can\u2019t imagine being with anybody who would find it appropriate to exclude your child from your wedding.\n\nThere are no circumstances where that is OK. \n\nAre you sure she\u2019s the one for you?", "INFO: why can\u2019t you do both? Why can\u2019t you have something small at the hospital and still continue with the 1-3 day Hindu wedding?", "NTA", "INFO:  Why does she think her racist mom wants to be witness to a marriage she doesn't approve of?  What about when racist mom says something shitty and racist during the hospital wedding?", "NAH\n\nDo a zoom wedding. And on your way out of the ballroom, stop by the hospital so she can see you all dressed up.

Would your fianc\u00e9 be open to have a non-denominational ceremony at the hospital with her mom there and you guys still have the planned wedding. While it really sucks about the racist mom, I understand your fianc\u00e9 connecting with mom while she\u2019s palliative. I\u2019m also brown, so I completely understand your reluctance to cater to the racist mom. Would you consider doing it for your fianc\u00e9?

Because it is also my wedding and they think it's ok to ask me to fake a smile to benefit someone who hates me. And let's throw in they also request my daughter get banned from the wedding. \n\nShe may be grieving but her reaction is one of putting a racist on a pedestal", "Sorry, but if asked you to ubject yourself to racism and allow your daughter to be banned from your wedding because she's black that person is an asshole because they're allowing and rewarding racism", "Oh really?

How does op trust her to do what is right for his daughter if she can\u2019t see how wrong her mom is now.\n\nBeing on your death bed does not give you a pass to be racist.

But grieving a parent isn\u2019t logical and she probably isn\u2019t thinking clearly.\n\nShe can love her partner and abhor racism and still be upset that her mom is dying.

Fianc\u00e9e mom is dying and won't be there for any other event.\n\nBut he wants her not to have her mom at her wedding. She can tell her mom that the child will be present or no hospital wedding; he doesn't want the wedding at the hospital either way, he's offering a ceremony but holding out for the big Hindu wedding. \n\nThis is complicated because of the lack of relationship and racism but it's her only opportunity to spend time with her mother; hospice care means she's dying soon.\n\nThey're best calling it off; Fianc\u00e9e will remember not being able to have her mother at the wedding and OP already resents her involvement with her mother's end if life."]}
