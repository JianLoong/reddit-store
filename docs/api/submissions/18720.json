I proposed to her about 5 months ago. We have the wedding planned for early September. We\u2019ve basically planned everything out by now and payed for a lot of things.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has never had a good relationship with her mother. Her moms very racist to me and cut her off after she introduced us. She hadn\u2019t spoken to her mom in nearly 6 years until she found out from an aunt that her mom was in multi organ failure(from drug and alcohol addiction) she isn\u2019t eligible for any transplants but can\u2019t leave the hospital. She\u2019s on like a hospice care plan in the hospital. My fianc\u00e9  has been spending more time with her and since she\u2019s heavily sedated she\u2019s calmer and nicer than usual.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is now saying that she doesn\u2019t want to get married without her mom and she saw some clips of hospital weddings online. She really wants us to get married inside her moms hospital room. Her mom will still barely talk to me and there\u2019s no way she\u2019d be okay with the Hindu preist we\u2019ve hired.\n\nAlso, we were both so excited for this wedding. My family has always treated her well and Indian weddings are very traditional and important. My mom and her planned this whole wedding together(and my mom helped pay) and although she\u2019d probably understand, I don\u2019t want to just cancel the wedding on her. And most of the things we\u2019ve purchased are non refundable.\n\nI\u2019ve said to my fianc\u00e9 that I think it\u2019s a bad idea, maybe we could have a ceremony in her room or something like that but still also have the wedding. But she says she doesn\u2019t want her mother to die before she\u2019s married and she wants her mom to really be there to make up for lost time. I feel like she\u2019s not thinking clearly because of how much she\u2019s grieving right now and she\u2019ll regret it later. Also her mom said that if we do get married in her room my 8YO daughter can\u2019t be there (because she\u2019s half black)\n\nI just don\u2019t want to give up my whole wedding with my family for someone who wasn\u2019t even going to be invited. I\u2019m still willing to compromise but I feel like an AH for not just doing it since she\u2019s going through so much.

That's just...wow. I don't care if she's dying that's despicable.\n\nYour wife is clearly grieving and your solution to have a small ceremony in the hospital room is completely appropriate (in addition to the big family ceremony).  If your wife is okay with not allowing your daughter to be there that's a whole other problem. A big one.\n\nI know she's trying to appease her mother but she's doing so at the expense of your daughter. She's not thinking how this one act will effect your daughter now and in the future. This is not okay. I really hope she is able to see clearly how wrong this is.\n\nIt's not just your wife's wedding, it is yours also. You shouldn't have to give up everything, you can do both. I would definitely force the issue with the hospital room ceremony though - if daughter can't be there then it's an absolute no.", "NTA\n\nThankfully, this is one of those problems where you can just procrastinate and it will solve itself.", "NTA:  I'm never one to say end a relationship but seriously consider if this would be the only time she would just want to deal with being discriminated against.

She's trying to make the most of the time she has left with her mother, and is probably already grieving. ASIDE from the racism (lol but who can put racism aside?), doing this would not mean you need to cancel the wedding you've already planned. This would more akin, perhaps, to a small ceremony relating to the marriage license as some people do at town hall, before the 'big' event. Still though, I think your fiancee will have to sadly accept that despite her strongest wishes, her mother is VERY unaccepting of you, and it's not practical, reasonable, or fair for her to expect you to participate in that.", "You could have a commitment ceremony at the hospital? Its a reasonable compromise IMO because its words without the music and should fulfill your GF's desires to reach out to her mom?\n\nNTA. I would never look at that woman again.

It sounds like she has a complicated relationship with her sorry excuse for a mother. It's still her mother and it can be difficult to navigate feelings like this at milestone events.\n\nBut canceling your actual wedding and EXCLUDING your daughter shouldn't even be an _option_. I am appalled that your s/o would even _entertain_ excluding her. This wedding isn't just about you and your s/o- your daughter is too. Yall are becoming a _family_ and the big wedding you're planning is to celebrate that. \n\nTalking as a step parent please for the love of all things holy _do not marry this woman if she thinks it's okay to exclude your daughter BECAUSE OF HER SKIN COLOR_. \n\nYou and your daughter deserve more.

Why should all wedding activities solely be focused on one woman, and everyone else who is effected by the marriage be ignored---particularly for a  woman who has treated you badly (and has treated her daughter badly as well)?\n\nI don't like ultimatums in general. But when I got to the lines where you say that if you do a marriage in the hospital you can not have a Hindu priest and worse, that your daughter will be excluded you need to take a stand. If your fiance is okay with her mother including those conditions then maybe it's time to put the wedding on hold in favor of doing some serious couples counseling.\n\nGood luck and let us know how it goes.", "NTA.  This is rough.  She's torn between the new feeling of being connected to her mother on a more normal level (probably for the first time in her life), knowing their time is very limited and wanting to include her in her wedding before she dies.  Can you have two ceremonies, one in her hospital room with very very limited attendees and your traditional wedding?", "NTA.\n\nDoesn't sound like the wife is thinking correctly. She could be dealing with a tremendous amount of guilt, even if it isn't warranted. Your offer of a bedside ceremony and still having your planned wedding in September was a completely fair, even an exceedingly generous, compromise, especially considering you'd be going to this extra effort to accommodate someone who has been openly bigoted to you *and* your child.\n\nI strongly suggest therapy for your wife. As soon as possible. Grief can start well before a death actually occurs. And considering the history, your wife is probably going through things she can't even grasp at the moment.", "NTA \nShe doesn't respects you and is racist about you and your daughter\nYour fiance should also consider her choices tbh she is just going through the pool of emotions NGL she is acting bit impulsive", ">I just don\u2019t want to give up my whole wedding with my family for someone who wasn\u2019t even going to be invited\n\nThen don't.

That's hurtful that your fiance would even consider excluding her in that way.", "You don\u2019t have to give up the whole wedding, you can get married in the hospital room and still have the big wedding. \n\nOverall you\u2019re NTA because of the feelings you have towards your dying MIL. But, I honestly don\u2019t see your marriage lasting. It seems like this is important to your fianc\u00e9e and her grieving process. She is going to end up regretting not getting married with her dying mother and she will resent you for it.", "NTA. You\u2019ve given her a compromise and that isn\u2019t enough for her.

Something a lot of people only experience once.", "NTA and the like that really sticks out to me is \u201cmy daughter wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the room because she is half black\u201d\n\nAt this point it\u2019s a very easy solution. Tell your partner there\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re getting married without your daughter\u2019s presence, and that you think it\u2019s best to postpone the wedding, potentially indefinitely if your partner won\u2019t stick up for your daughter", "YTA for marrying someone so disrespectful and awful.

She wants to do the right thing, as she can't get a do-over if she made the wrong decision. And that will cause her to live with guilt.

You need to talk this out with her in a calm minute and should really stand up for yourself for the reasons I named above.

If you\u2019re willing to do it, i think a compromise in this instance would be a generous and kind thing for you to do (going ahead with your planned wedding and having a ceremony and celebration at the hospital too, maybe even having the hospital ceremony first to appease her) - provided that your daughter is not only allowed to be present but also made to feel welcome by your fianc\u00e9es mother. That has to be a non-negotiable. But also, i don\u2019t really think it\u2019s necessary for you to compromise here if you don\u2019t want to.

His parents took this very seriously and have since educated themselves on Hinduism, my native language, and the general heritage their future grandkids will have. The entire world will other them, but I want them to always feel equal and secure in their own family. \n\nIf this has even been brought up in the presence of your daughter, she\u2019s already been othered and made to feel less-than in her own home and family. That will sit with her for the rest of her life. Despite grieving, if your fianc\u00e9e (and you, by tolerating it) is even remotely willing to allow this to happen to her future family, I think you need to have a serious conversation with about what she\u2019s really saying about her morals/ethics and how easily they can be compromised. And I think you need to have a serious conversation with yourself about what you\u2019re willing to tolerate around your child. \n\nYour daughter is innocent. Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother is not. Why is the abuser coming ahead of the victims?", "wtf is wrong with your fiancee that she would subject you and your daughter to this racist?\n\nyou need to rethink this whole thing, man.\n\nyou are NTA.", "NAH (except MIL of course)\n\nThis is a hard situation and there is no right answer. I have experience from your wife's side of things to a point, but I made very different choices-- my mother didn't get a seventieth chance at my expense and my partner's. But I empathize with how hard that choice is, especially when palliative care and the threat of impending death seems to be mellowing things out.\n\nThe fact remains that you and your daughter would not be welcome to your own wedding, and that isn't fair to you or to her. Imagine how that family dynamic would play out after MIL's death-- your daughter's introduction to her new step mother would be that she thought it more important to have her drugged up, hateful, blatantly racist mother at the wedding than the little girl she's going to be a mother to herself. \n\nAnd your religion (assuming you're practicing to some extent, given that you were planning to include a Hindu priest) would also be disregarded. If your MIL doesn't actively object to his inclusion, she would likely still be disrespectful in some way. Then of course there's the rest of your family, who you didn't say would be actively excluded but I imagine wouldn't be able to fit into a hospital room regardless.\n\nThe of course there's you and your comfort level. You are half of the wedding. You are the person she is choosing as her partner for the rest of your lives, and her mother once cut her off just for loving you. Now she wants the ceremony representing the ultimate expression and consecration of that love to be upended and replanned around the inclusion of someone who, at least up until the morphine and deathbed experience, was so violently against it that she was willing to disown her own child in protest? \n\nI know how your wife feels. I know what it's like to desperately want a mother with a history of cruelty to finally apologize and love you and be a mom. Because of that, I know how tempting it is to take a sliver of kindness and love and believe that it's a sign that it's finally happening, because deep down we all believe that family ruptures inevitably come to happy endings-- especially on a deathbed. We can't help but think that every conflict is destined to fade at the deathbed, dwarfed by the reality of mortality and permanent separation. And the scariest thing of all about familial estrangement is having to accept that there is a (good) chance that your parent will die without ever giving you that closure, and you'll be left with the aching feeling of having never been loved or parented or protected with no way to resolve the hurt. I understand that. I am still working through that following my mother's death.\n\nBut as attractive as the promise of deathbed healing is, even the perfect wedding in her mother's hospital room-- where she is sweet and loving to you and respectful of your faith and consistently, unconditionally kind to her daughter-- will not heal the damage she did to your wife OR YOU up to that point. Even if everything goes exactly as your wife is dreaming it will, the damage won't be undone. It's a bandaid. One nice memory that she hopes will cover up all of the painful memories underneath it but that will ultimately just keep them just barely out of sight.\n\nAnd the price for that one nice memory is teaching her stepdaughter that her safety, personhood, and inclusion in the family you're building are less important to her new stepmother than the whims of an old woman who refused even on her deathbed chose bigotry over her daughter. Your marriage will be founded on the memory that your beliefs, family, daughter, comfort, and emotional safety were less important than the lure of an emotional bandaid. \n\nDelusion sounds like a strong word, but that's what this is. I say that as someone who has had the same delusion. Deathbed reconciliations are a delusion, a lie that everyone participates in to avoid addressing the true cause of the estrangement and then clings to after the fact. The family and life that your wife has the opportunity to build with you and your daughter is REAL, and that's where real healing will come from. She's not being rational right now and it's very good of you to understand and hold space for that, but this is not a reasonable thing for her to ask or expect and it will have consequences for your marriage down the line if she does.\n\nThat said, I know a gay couple-- one Mexican Catholic and one Indian Hindu-- who had three weddings to avoid this kind of issue. One as soon as gay marriage was legalized at the courthouse to make it official just in case the tides turned again, one in the Mexican Catholic style, and one traditional Indian wedding.

The part about your mixed daughter not being there is bullshit, so you can obviously push for some of your input to be included, but for the most part try to think of it as a ceremony specifically for her mom.

Surprise!

I made the right choice in the end, but leading up to that I was basically a fucked up three-year-old just crying because there were no right answers. This woman literally tried to kill me when I was a child and even the terror of that experience didn't seem real next to the delusional hope that maybe she loved me now and maybe I would get closure.\n\nIt wasn't until I'd thought through what it would be like if we visited her and imagined how much she could hurt someone I loved-- really pictured it-- that I realized how insane I was being. OP seems to be taking this very stoically and generously, and unfortunately that insulates his fiance from the reality of the damage she is permitting.

She is being an asshole, and she is going to do serious damage (and has already done it).

I was so afraid of her that my brain actually shut down when faced with the prospect of dealing with her even over the phone, but apparently I was the perfect daughter when I did answer-- I just don't remember. It wasn't until she hurt someone I loved that I snapped out of it and cut her off. \n\nGranted, I am absolutely projecting all over this. Hardcore.

NTA.\n\nI say this as someone whose dad died only a couple of months ago: there is NO acceptable reason for your fianc\u00e9e to gloss over her mother's racism. Not towards you, and absolutely not towards your daughter.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is going through a lot. As such, postpone the wedding until she comes to her senses. I hate to say it, but you need to buy time before you marry this woman.  Let the ever gentle hand of Lucifer take her mother peacefully pass to the depths of hell. Then get married.", "NTA. Please please update us.", "NTA\n\nThe is a quote from the Lorax that comes to mind.................", "NTA.  Is your future wife ok with racism against you or your daughter?  That Is concerning.", "Im back.  I read and read and became angrier and angrier on your behalf.  What is wrong with you?! Snap out of this trance your under. Your fianc\u00e9 is coddling a racist, dying, alcoholic and drug addict, and placing you and your family aside.  Why in the Hindu Gods name are you putting up with this and not showing any anger or frustration?  I would never marry someone acting this way, especially after excluding your daughter who is half-black!!! \nThis post is just offensive and triggering!", "NTA have your wedding as planned and then she can wear her wedding dress to the hospital and show her. I\u2019ve seen this before too it\u2019s nice", "NTA. The racist MIL is circling the drain and will be dead soon if she has multiple organ failure in the ICU. Unless the original wedding is planned for the next couple weeks, she ain\u2019t making it. \n\nI normally don\u2019t recommend compromise with shitty parents who are in the Finding Out stage of FAFO, but she\u2019s so out of it she won\u2019t know nor care if the wedding really happened. Have an unofficial ceremony in her room to shut everyone up. \n\nRemember the end of Lethal Weapon 4? No. Well Riggs and his girlfriend did a last-minute unofficial wedding because she didn\u2019t want to give birth without being married, so they just grabbed a Rabbi (closest religious person around) and did a quickie ceremony. \n\nDo that, but maybe have a friend dress as a priest or explain the situation to the hospital Chaplain. Remember, it\u2019s not official until the marriage license is signed.", "NTA", "NTA. Honestly the fact that she has been racist to you in the past, won't speak to you now and won't allow your daughter in the hospital room for this due to her being half black is enough reason to say no. Ask her if she is really okay with you being treated badly and her step daughter being left out.", "> Also her mom said that if we do get married in her room my 8YO daughter can\u2019t be there (because she\u2019s half black)\n\nDo you actually intend to go forward with marrying a woman who would agree to such a thing? \n\nNTA for not getting married in the hospital, but a huge, HUGE asshole, and a bad father, for keeping your fiancee in your daughter's life in any way.", "My take is your fiancee sees getting married to the man her mother is racist about is rubbing her marrying you in mom\u2019d dying face.  Of all the things that mom might welcome, your wedding isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nSo consider presenting that to your wife.  Does she really want to aggravate mom?\n\nSorry this is happening to you.", "Wait, so you're expected to cancel a whole awesome wedding full of all the people you love so that you can have a hospital wedding with your fiance's racist Mom because she \"doesn't want to get married without her Mom there\" even though doing so *requires you to get married without your daughter there*??? HELL NAW.\n\nNTA.", "Nta. Your compromise of doing a ceremony in MIL\u2019s room is perfectly acceptable. I do feel sad for your fianc\u00e9 tho, and I\u2019ll explain why. My dads dad was horribly abusive, to both my dad and his mother (and then to my mom and us kids, whenever we\u2019d visit). My dad still spent his whole life trying to make my grandpa proud, and when that man died, I think it really tore my dad up inside knowing that he would never heal that hurt. I think that may be what your fianc\u00e9 is going through. I think it\u2019s really easy to say \u201cthat person is awful, why do you even want their approval\u201d when you don\u2019t have the kind of strained relationship with your mom that she has with hers. Idk I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong at all for wanting your wedding and for resenting your fianc\u00e9s mom, but also this is going to be a really difficult time for her, and it might be even worse given that she hasn\u2019t had a relationship with her mom for a while. When her mom was in good health, your fianc\u00e9 likely thought she had decades to repair the relationship, and now she is realizing that she doesn\u2019t.

You and especially your daughter deserve better. \n\nThis will not be the only time she will let cruel and racist people harm your family.", "INFO\n\n1. How exactly did your fiancee react whenever her mother said racist things to you?Quietly mumbled an apology to you?  Passive silence?  A half-assed \"Don't say that?\"\n2.

In this case, multiple organ failure.", "Fianc\u00e9e wants mom there. \n\nMom doesn\u2019t want OP, his religion, or his child. \n\nThis is a time where a hard line gets to be drawn.

She need therapy and learnt how to refocus this type of grief.\n\nIn OPs position I would ask fiance what is the difference with the proyected wedding, he didn't say what was the plan, but is easy to assume that after 6 years with no relationship the mother was not invited, so why change the whole wedding for somebody you weren't planing to invite  before just because she is in her deathbed (he said the mother hasn't apologised or changed her ways towards him)?", "She's had six years to come to terms with the consequences of her mother's racism. Yes it's really difficult; my father was an alcoholic who drank himself into a stroke, lingered on for years, and then finally died this March. It was very hard to wade through the love I have for him vs the destruction he caused. But she had Six. Years. Surely she must have thought about it at some point.", "She did. She was NC during that time and it was only end-stage organ failure that reconnected them. I'm guessing it wasn't just the racism but the cumulative effects of her behavior. This is potentially a daughter who grew up being mistreated by her mother, who is now dying and playing nice, hoping for the fantasy of what a mother is supposed to be in her last days.", "You need to run friend. She is grieving. However, if she can not see your perspective in this matter, I would not marry her because:\n\n1. She wants you to commit your life to her, with the only witness being the mother who despises your existence. \n\n2. She wants you to do it without your kid!

At least she's honest. In no world should you appease this woman. Obviously your fiancee is going through a lot emotionally. I really don't know how to help her.

Is it a sign of things to come?", "NTA but your focusing on the wrong thing. Her mom is a racist and you should in no way get married until you talk to your fianc\u00e9 of why the racism is okay now? Your fianc\u00e9 is willing to hurt your daughter for her mom? Push has come to shove and you are in the cold with your daughter because your fianc\u00e9 is choosing her racist mother over you.

Do not have a hospital wedding for a racist.", "NTA. \n\nFrom the heading, it sounded like you were going to be the AH, but with every word you said, your MIL got worse and worse. Then you got to the line where you said she won't allow your daughter to be there and I thought, \"Hell, no!!!\n\nIf your fiance could not live with that decision, I would have a simple hospital wedding and later the real one as planned. It doesn't even have to be a legal wedding in the hospital, more of a commitment ceremony. \n\nNo way would I want a wedding for the sake of someone who barely speaks to me.", "NTA. BUT- but, if it makes your grieving fianc\u00e9 happy you can do 2 weddings. A small one at the hospital so fianc\u00e9 can see mom, maybe get a picture that will be special to her since mom is on the way out, and then another bigger wedding with everyone.

I feel badly for your fiancee, losing your mom is hard, but she can't unilaterally hijack the wedding that belongs to BOTH of you.

Deadbeat,  estranged mother is at the end of her life after decades of addiction and is now dictating how the wedding should be?  Sadly,  it sounds like the fiancee is in la la land, pretending this is the caring,  loving mom she never had and desperately wants some kind of final special memories.

I was more pissed off and angry because her dumb ass ruined any chance of a reconciliation, even though I\u2019m 99.99% sure nothing of the sort would happen. I get your wife\u2019s pain, l truly do.
