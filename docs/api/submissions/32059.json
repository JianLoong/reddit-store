I never saw much issue with it until I became a teenager. About 2 years ago I was forced to pay rent for small things like dating as a minor because they never wanted me to do \u201cgrown up\u201d things like dating. I\u2019ve made a post about it here before (parents were deemed TA) but I have since deleted it in fear they would find it.\n\nFast forward to now, and I am in college and currently have a (M19) boyfriend. I pay rent for them still, but only because I live in their house as an adult. They only started charging me after I lost my virginity to my boyfriend, even though that wasn\u2019t the plan we collectively agreed on. They haven\u2019t been happy that I still make it a habit to see my boyfriend sometimes.\n\nSince then, it feels like my parents have used every trick in the book to keep me in their pocket. It started when they emphasized my  11pm curfew. We already decided on this when I turned 18, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Theyre very strict on curfew. If you\u2019re even a few minutes late they will lock the door on you. I haven\u2019t had that happen because I made sure I was always on time.\n\nThey constantly make new expectations, like if my chores aren\u2019t done, I have to go home and do them. If I\u2019m at school and on the other side of town, I have to go home immediately to do them if I want to hang out with my friends. In order for me to leave the house, the chores have to be done and checked by one of them. If they\u2019re not done and if they\u2019re not checked, I can\u2019t leave. \n\nThe chores also have to be perfect. If there\u2019s even a couple of mistakes they would yell at me and claim that you didn\u2019t do them or that you never cared about the household or family and only cared about being able to go anywhere.\n\nI constantly complain to my friends, boyfriend and therapist about all the things they do. They all agree that my parents are very controlling. My parents sometimes hear me vent and threaten to kick me out for not being grateful. I always feel upset because I always follow the rules to make sure that I never end up homeless. \n\nIt all reached a boiling point two days ago. I was on the phone with my boyfriend, and I started swearing. Swearing at my house is a no-no, so my parents got mad and said that since I wanted to be \u201cgrown up\u201d so bad, I have a month to pack my things and leave. \n\nIt\u2019s been a tough few days. I have a place to live with some friends now, but my parents say that I\u2019m an asshole for not recognizing everything they do for me and for complaining about their rules to other people. At the same time, I think they are being bad parents for putting all of these rules in place just for the sake of control and always finding new ways of keeping me in the house, away from my friends or anything not related to school.

They aren't looking to throw you out, but manage you through coercive control, so this is going to get bad before you get out. If you can, make your final move out date a surprise - give them a date of the end of that month they gave you, get all your stuff moved as soon as possible, and then just stop going home at all. Make sure you have all your documents (I believe social security is a big thing if you are American).

You are 18, you PAY RENT, and you still have a curfew and chores and (ridiculous) rules to follow?  Not how it works.\n\nIf they want rent money, PARTICULARLY BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN LEGALLY AN ADULT, then you are a tenant with the rights and privileges that come with being an adult that pays at least some of their own bills.  I don't mean that you can just trash the house or should never pitch in and help or anything but certainly coming and going as you please at what hours you please with whomever you please and using whatever goddamn shitty language you fucking feel like.   \n\nI'd be going no or very low contact with them.  Once they realize you called their bluff they will start doing everything in their power to manipulate/blackmail you into coming back.  I don't think for one minute they really intend to kick you out-if you begged forgiveness and please-don't-make-me-homeless, etc, I can almost guarantee you would get a last-minute reprieve after they judge you've humiliated and prostrated yourself enough to get back in their good graces.  They want to control y ou and actually kicking you out means they can't do that.  The only other possible explanation is that they really haven't thought this move through-but even if that is the case, I guarantee after a few months, when they realize you really did it and cast them off, the manipulation/blackmail will start up to get you back under their thumb, and they've programmed you your whole life that you can't assert yourself.  It will take a lot of strength to resist that programming; the easier/safer way is to not give them the opportunity to use it against you.\n\n I promise, even if your situation is crashing on your friend's lumpy couch and eating Ramen three times a day, once you get a taste of being out of their house you are going to LOVE your new found freedom and wonder how/why you put with their control so long.  Just as other people cautioned, don't go crazy with your new independence.  Honestly, parents like this set up their kids to fail, because they have been SO controlled their whole lives and never allowed to mess up and learn from a mistake that when they get out on their own they can't be responsible.

I\u2019ve moved out and never considered going back. Tbh my relationship now is 100x better than I ever thought it could be bc there is space to be apart. I only see my parents on holidays now and even then sometimes not. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s easier to appreciate them from afar. But if you decide their behavior is too much just know you could cut contact and it would be fair for you to do so. \n\nWhile you\u2019re away you also need to learn to build boundaries with them and family. If they give you a hard time it\u2019s okay to hang up the phone it\u2019s okay to block them while you have space. It\u2019s okay to say no if they ask for things and it\u2019s okay to shut down family if they try to give you a hard time. It won\u2019t be easy but you do these things for yourself now, they will eventually adjust. \n\nI know we live in a different time than our parents so there will be conflicting sides.

I agree with your therapist. Let's take the gratitude bit. There's harsh parenting (which I'm fairly sympathetic to because it at least accepts the inevitability of ups and downs), and there's controlling parenting, which refuses to accept failure, even once. If your parents kept the same rules, but without trying to demand constant and frivolous enforcement to your comings and goings on a day-by-day basis, I'd say you should have gratitude, you'd just need breathing room from your parents to go out and find it. Here your parents actions are systematically removing everything in life you might have reason to *be* grateful about.\n\nFor whatever reason, your parents have decided to never forgive you for having a romance, and they have made their interactions with you not about your future development and current actions, but about power and control.\n\nThis was probably inevitable.", "\"pay rent for small things like dating as a minor\" - what does this mean?", "Just curious to ask\u2026.
