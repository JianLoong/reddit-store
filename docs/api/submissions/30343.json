This was a busy day as we had two social engagements planned and had a babysitter booked months in advance for the second evening event (social gathering at husband\u2019s friends house). I agreed to attend and had no issues. \n\nHowever when today finally rolled around I found myself the sole parent of our sick toddler and really felt run off my feet all day. Husband did get up with her and started her morning routine, but I did everything else. I offered to stay at home with her so he can go to his first social engagement (friends birthday party) expecting that he would be back in an hour or so, I guess cause I would have done the same if the situation were reversed, although I didn\u2019t explicitly state I expected him home an hour later. He returned two hours later and wanted to work out, meaning baby duties continued to fall on me. I\u2019m pretty irritated (and tired) at this point, having fed her all her meals, walked the dog and taken baby and dog to park for 80 minutes, cleaned the kitchen and did all the housework. I felt I owed him no more of my time and no longer had any interest in going to his friends house tonight. So I canceled the babysitter (she was already paid in advance) and told him so. He lost his shit and started throwing a tantrum about how I\u2019ve ruined everything and is now completely ignoring the baby and blaming me for being a bad wife, mother, bitch etc etc.\n\nI feel bad (kind of) for canceling this social event I knew he was looking forward to but I feel zero affection or altruism given his complete lack of interest in my well being all day and never once thought to do something to make my day easier. Maybe I expect too much? I suppose all mothers have to feel like they\u2019re working two full time jobs and just deal with it? (we both work full time if it matters but had this weekend off).\n\nSo Reddit AITA?\n\nEDIT: I canceled my own plan to go to husbands friends house.

He shouldn\u2019t have expected to have strings attached with this offer. Also is going to the park with your kid and dog such a huge chore? And you should have spoken up about needing a break when he wanted to work out. Also just canceling the sitter without communicating was spiteful and rash. \n\nHis reaction was uncalled for as well.

Is your husband always this emotionally abusive?\n\nIt sounds like you take on the burden of sole parenting most of the time, so he definitely needs to step up. But you need to communicate instead of passively aggressively lashing out. If you are not emotionally safe to communicate your needs with your husband, then there is a much larger problem here that needs to be addressed.", "ESH and I highly recommend marriage counseling. I know having a baby is stressful and tiring and your husband, at least in this situation, does not seem to be pulling his weight, but you need to work on your communication", "I understand your frustration, but in this instance YTA.

If your husband had recognized your needs too, and been prepared to share the housework and childcare as the other parent, we\u2019d never read this post, so ESH (and it sounds like you both could benefit from some immediate marriage counseling). \n\nPlease understand in my opinion you should not have sucked it up and gone to the event anyway, nor do I think your husband isn\u2019t to blame as well; far from it- he acted selfishly and his anger and name calling when you told him you weren\u2019t going is hugely concerning and out of bounds.   A bad mother??!  Wtf \n\nYou both have communication problems and parenting to share and work out.  \n\nHowever OP, YTA here, you\u2019re being passive aggressive trying to get back at him because you know it will upset him, instead of telling him you feel wronged and don\u2019t have the energy to go out, you admit as much in the title of your post.\n\nSidenote, I really don\u2019t understand what canceling the babysitter really has to do with anything other than cementing your unavailability to go, and why can\u2019t he go alone and tell the friends that your child isn\u2019t feeling well and you\u2019re staying home?    It seems like your marriage has a really unhealthy dynamic overall with what we have to go on here.", "NTA and you\u2019re not expecting too much. For him to ignore the baby is disgusting but the part where you said I suppose all mothers have to feel like they\u2019re working two full time jobs and just deal with it\u201d couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. \nI work full time. My husband is active duty navy. If he is not deployed he is my partner in everything. M-Th he does bed time because I have mornings with him leaving for work before I do. I have bedtime F-Sunday because he wakes up with her on the weekends and allows me to sleep in as long as I need. He cleans the house, like the whole house, sometimes even without my help if he\u2019s more free than I am so we can just enjoy the weekend together. He doesn\u2019t need a list or for me to ask him, he just does it. He can work a 24 hour shift, maybe getting 3 hours of sleep, come home, and immediately get down and start playing with her.\nMen not being present fathers or partners does not have to be the standard and you do not have to put up with it.", "Sorry, but soft YTA. \n\nIt seems to me that you were unfair in your expectations and lack of communication.

Secondly,  your husband flying off the handle like that because you have had a tough day while he has been out enjoying himself is abusive. Name calling and ignoring the baby is punishment for not doing what he wants.  This isn't a normal healthy relationship. Get help.", "YTA. This is extraordinarily passive aggressive especially considering zero communication from you on your expectations. Yikes. \ud83d\ude2c", "YTA. You need to work on direct communication. Mind reading isn't an effective strategy for marriage or parenting success. Tell him when you need him to take the baby, don't just sulk. He responded really badly, but from his view, your tantrum came out of nowhere.", "NTA.  Your husband is an ass.\n\nFor those that are questioning this - the babysitter never agreed to watch a sick kid.

Two hours, when you did NOT communicate with him that you wanted him to only go for one hour, is not an unreasonable amount of time to spend out with friends. If you wanted him home earlier, you should have been explicit.\n\nCancelling the prepaid sitter is 100% a \u201ccutting off your nose to spite your face\u201d move. It was crappy for you both, and you\u2019re an AH for doing it.\n\nYou two need therapy and better communication (as well as a firm commitment to stop acting resentfully when unspoken preferences aren\u2019t upheld because the other person isn\u2019t PSYCHIC,) if this marriage is to survive.", "Esh- I can see where you're coming from and y'all just need working on communicating.", "ESH. Your husband is not a mind reader; therefore, you can not expect him to know exactly what you need, when not specifically stated.

And taking kid to the park with the e dog for an hour isn\u2019t a big deal whoop -", "ESH you need to learn how to communicate better. 1 you made assumptions about how long he was going to be gone and then got angry bc he didn\u2019t read your mind. Also two hours seems reasonable to drive there, visit for awhile, then drive back. 2 you never told him your change of plans instead you just went ahead and canceled without consulting him. He is also the ah because he should have known to take over once he got back and he certainly shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. You all sound very immature and need to learn how be better partners to each other.", "Not the asshole.

Yourself out for dinner while she got baby to bed and come home to a quiet evening.  Seems like you created misery for yourself.", "NTA I get why you did this.

I just didn\u2019t want to go with him.", "He got up and attended to the child\u2019s needs, morning is the busiest time. When he went out he was only gone two hours, that\u2019s including travel time.", "If by \"didn't read her mind\" you mean \"didn't stop to think about anyone else\" then yeah that's fair but I don't think you do. \n\nMaybe I'm doing it wrong, but if I knew my partner was sick and alone with our also sick child, I would be aware of the fact that that's so and I would be sure to be quick when I went out because I i love my partner and that's what love looks like to me. \n\nI understand it may not look like that to everyone, but thinking about your sick partner and child seems like the very least one should be able to expect from their partner.", "True. We pay her very well!", "She could have if her partner didn\u2019t take all the downtime for himself earlier in the day. And no-she dosent have to attend her husbands buddy\u2019s party when he\u2019s been a jerk all day", "I agree except I didn\u2019t anticipate having to be run off my feet the whole day while he got to do whatever he wanted. If he pulled his weight today I would have gone.", "So you punish yourself?", "Ya I agree with that, and she offered to let him go. She needs to communicate more", "And I\u2019m glad you think that way, I agree that should be the standard. But OP wasn\u2019t sick (at least from the post that\u2019s what I gathered). \n\nI don\u2019t have kids so I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have to take care of them, but imo 2 hours doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s that bad. If I were that fed up and my husband came home and wanted to work out, id personally shut that down and change over the duties to him. I wouldn\u2019t just expect him to think I was that frazzled over two hours without saying anything", "He didn\u2019t take all the downtime, she offered to do him a favor and let him go for two hours to a friends birthday. She also let him take the workout time by not speaking up. I don\u2019t think he was necessarily the villain or a jerk for not realizing that she needed a break without saying anything. \n\nAnd no, she doesn\u2019t have to attend at all, but the way she went about it wasn\u2019t the best.", ">If he pulled his weight today I would have gone.\n\nBy your own description, you were somehow expected him to read your mind and know what you were thinking and feeling. What I hear is that you completely failed to communicate your wants and needs, and instead acted petulantly when he didn't read your mind. Why didn't you tell him that you needed him to take over the toddler and skip his workout? If you asked and he refused this would be a very different story.  ~~Tentative Y - T - A~~  EDIT: revised judgment to ESH based on comment below.", "You said he did the morning duties and was at a party for 2 hours, then worked out. Unless he was working out for like 4 hours then it seems like he was contributing? And you could have asked for a break instead of him working out. It was like you were testing him and punished him for \u201cfailing.\u201d Does he ever take over duties when you have things to do with your friends?", "Is it punishment,  or not wanting a stranger in her house when she is too tired to attend anyway?\n\nStill ESH.OP, you should have communicated.", "Yea. Martyrdom only works if she does this.", "I\u2019m harsh on people that are scant with details. Work wasn\u2019t mentioned for instance, I\u2019m assuming work is a him issue in this relationship.", "If he\u2019s doing his part as a parent then he should know how tiring minding a child can be some days and should be able to just be in tune w his partner enough to say \u2018hey, you\u2019ve been w the babe all day. I\u2019ll take her for x hours before we go so you can do your thing.\u2019 \n\nEspecially after he went to the party alone and then got to relax for a while longer afterwards. \n\nIt\u2019s not like he was at work. He literally got the day off from daddy duties and didn\u2019t give his wife or kid a second thought", "I guess as parents I naturally thought it would be obvious that one parent does not want to be stuck with the majority of the childcare responsibility. This happens many weekends when I\u2019m not working. He wants a break from work and to relax? Me too. I\u2019m annoyed I think at his lack of respect for me, and my wants, which are no different than his. I agree that better communication would have circumvented all this. I did in fact though tell him he would be on baby duty after he got back, but he didn\u2019t like my tone and walked off.", "He did an hour of the morning. Then he was around but did not help with baby. Then he went to his party, came home, we argued, he worked out then left for his friends house. Soooo he took care of her for maybe 1-2 hours? The rest was me. I also almost never go out as I am too busy but I\u2019m sure he would have helped out if I were gone so that\u2019s a reasonable point.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like the babysitter is a stranger, I\u2019m sure they vetted her and have used her before. Hiring the sitter wasn\u2019t the issue, she just didn\u2019t want to go and canceled last minute. Didn\u2019t seem like a punishment to stay home", "She said they both work full time and this was over the weekend. I guess I\u2019m just confused on your original comment of her being n t a and being pressured into having their kid", "Cute. You\u2019re an idiot but thanks for playing. We are both full time physicians FYI", "He went to a party for 2 hours. He helped do the morning stuff he didn\u2019t get the whole day off. And he wasn\u2019t just relaxing he worked out. Which also probably took like an hour. Yes that\u2019s him time but if op didn\u2019t say anything about not wanting him to do that then why should he assume there\u2019s an issue? Is 2-3 hours of watching your kid really that bad?", "I'll revise my judgment above to E-S-H, but I have to say that it sounds like you both are really immature and need to learn to actively communicate, establish and respect each others boundaries.", "ESH. You both sound very immature and spiteful towards each other. You need to start openly communicating about your needs and feelings", "Well you didn\u2019t state that you argued about him working out specifically. You made it seem like you just expected him to take over without saying anything.", "I must have missed that.", "Guess they give any idiot a degree now days.", "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re a parent or not but does one really need to say let\u2019s try to split the responsibility of raising and caring for a child 50/50? I am not an unfair person. If the situation were reversed and I left baby duties to my spouse for two hours I would come home and be more helpful, asked or not. My error is assuming this is the case for everyone. I am not a stay at home parent and work just as many if not more hours than my husband so it shouldn\u2019t be illogical to assume 50:50 split on baby duties. And it\u2019s not that caring for baby is a chore \u2014 I\u2019m just miffed that my time is not respected and that I\u2019m somehow assumed to have to do more work because I\u2019m the mother.", "\u2026.it\u2019s his kid???"]}
