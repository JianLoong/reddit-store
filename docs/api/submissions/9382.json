The activities seemed perfect, and I was looking forward to this for months because I wanted to propose to her at the end of the trip.\n\n5 days before the trip, Sarah dropped the ball on me that she invited 2 of her friends to meet her there. I was upset because I wanted to spend 1:1 time with Sarah for our anniversary. I feel like it was plain and clear that this was a trip for just us. Even though I expressed my concerns, Sarah insisted that her friends already made plans to come and won't back out.\n\nI decided to accept this because there was no way for me to force her friends to not come (I wish I fought more on this). I figured we could make some changes to our plans, and I would still be able to propose to her privately. Sarah essentially blew me off for her friends and we didn't get any private time.\n\nAfter 3 days of being in second place, I decided to leave the trip and head home. I told Sarah why I was leaving, and she was upset. She told her friends about my decision, and I was ganged up on. They said we were all having a great time. She thinks I'm being a jerk for making her pick between her friends and me (even though her friends weren't invited in the first place). I never had personal issues with her friends prior to this trip. I never made Sarah pick between me or her friends because everyone needs friends outside of a relationship.\n\nI'm at home now and thinking about everything. I have a day to myself before Sarah comes home, so at least I get to relax a bit. Sarah and her friends think I'm overreacting and think I ruined the trip. I think Sarah was disrespectful and rude to me by ruining the purpose of this trip and having her friends gang up on me.\n\nAITA For Leaving a Vacation I Planned for my GF After Her Friends Came Along?\n\nEDIT: This was a planned \\*anniversary/romantic\\* trip. I was clear that we have plans for just us two. We've been on other anniversary trips together without her friends there. We did discuss marriage beforehand, so it's not like a proposal wouldn't been out of the blue.\n\nMINOR UPDATE: My friends are here at the house and they have been running potential interference, just in case her friends try to bombard and harass me.

She obviously couldn't have known you wanted to propose, but that's beside the point. Maybe you would have wanted to invite your friends? Maybe you would have wanted to plan some activities for yourself? She needed to have told you about her friends coming more than five days in advance.\n\nGiven that you've been in a relationship for five years, you know better why this happened than anyone else, but to me, this seems like there was some huge disconnect between your expectations and her expectations. I would figure those communication issues out.", "NTA\n\nThis is seriously one of my biggest pet peeves when people crowbar themselves or other people into a trip without asking.\n\nI tried to setup a memorial day backpacking trip last year where it was supposed to just be my wife and another couple. My wife's friends heard about it and invited themselves (with an 11 yo) and also invited another couple. The final headcount was like 12 or something. Stressed me the F out because I was now the ringleader of all these people, not to mention the logistics of getting all the shuttle figured out. Couple days before the trip, the weather looked like it was going to rain the whole time, so we canceled the entire thing. Such a relief.

You were treated absolutely horribly by your GF.  This is a huge deal.  Not as big as tripping and falling onto some dude's dick, but definitely bigger than switching your brewed coffee with Sanka instant coffee.\n\nYou two need to work this out so it doesn't happen again.", "NTA. Your GF is an incredibly selfish jerk, though. You might want to look into that.

A good partner tries to include you. Does she often railroad your like this? \n\nShe was soooo wrong in all the things she did, but that\u2019s not the big red flag. People make mistakes and learn from them. Her denying that she did anything wrong is the \u201creturn the ring\u201d-behavior.

Will she continue to do so? NTA but hit pause on that proposal until you\u2019ve really worked that issue out.", "100% NTA and Sarah and friends are definitely AH here. After 5 years, I wonder if this is part of a pattern.  Can you really marry someone who won't take your side?  And from a female perspective her friends are now out to get you even if they smile in your face.  Every argument you have with your gf, every disagreement or misstep and their vindictive memories of this will come out against you. \n\nThis may have saved you.

She refused to compromise. She spent all her time with her friends and ignored you.  She could have easily spent a night or two with just the two of you.\n4. She dismissed and minimized your valid feelings. \n5. She tried to play victim when you\u2019re the one hurt.\n5.

Who the heck even does this? She knew you were planning most of the details of the trip. It was clear it was meant for just the 2 of you. Then, before discussing it with you, she invites 2 friends. That's selfish. That's not an intimate trip anymore. It's the girls then you. I would be really upset but before you make any big decisions, discuss this with her and why you feel like it was duper disrespectful. I'm sure she would be pissed if you invited 2 of your friends without asking her.

Big time.", "NTA. But she is, why would anyone invite their friends on an anniversary trip and then get their friends to gang up on you for ruining their fun. They shouldn't have been there in the first place. I would be rethinking if she's as serious about your relationship as you are. Her priorities are questionable. This was a trip to celebrate your relationship. If she was determined to have a trip with her friends, she should have done it separately.", "NTA: Time to end the relationship.", "NTA\n\nWow. The trip sounds amazing. It is perfect for any deserving girlfriend. Anyone truly in love enough to accept your proposal would know this. There are more and better fishes in the sea. Keep looking!", "Please don't follow her massive disrespect with a proposal. She just demonstrated how little weight she gives your relationship, and you as her partner. Her friends are more important to her than the man she's been with for 5 entire years. You guys either need counseling or to end it. But definitely don't reward her during this stage of figuring out wth you're gonna do.\n\nI am saying these things because it's clear she doesn't want to marry you. I think she knew what you were doing and this is her immature way of solving the problem. That's a massive disrespect.", "When she comes back it looks like you guys need to have a serious talk. There was clearly a lack of respect on her part before AND during the trip.

Your GF was right out of order for allowing her friends to accompany you; is she normally this thoughtless? Honestly, I would have cancelled the trip and not gone at all. Given the way she favoured her friends I'd also be very tempted to tell her you planned to propose but that's off the table now.

I would definitely table the proposal for now. \n\nINFO:\n\nDo the two of you live together? Do you pick up most of the expenses? She may be too comfortable with the status quo without any interest in taking the next step - getting married. \n\nOr she may have gotten a case of cold feet and reacted very immaturely.

She thinks I'm being a jerk for making her pick between her friends and me (even though her friends weren't invited in the first place). I never had personal issues with her friends prior to this trip. I never made Sarah pick between me or her friends because everyone needs friends outside of a relationship.\n\nI'm at home now and thinking about everything. I have a day to myself before Sarah comes home, so at least I get to relax a bit. Sarah and her friends think I'm overreacting and think I ruined the trip. I think Sarah was disrespectful and rude to me by ruining the purpose of this trip and having her friends gang up on me.\n\nAITA For Leaving a Vacation I Planned for my GF After Her Friends Came Along?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This was a planned anniversary trip that you had planned for just the two of you for months.

It is very very odd that she tells you less than a week beforehand that 2 of her friends were joining. Did they grab some kind of \"last minute deal\"? Or had they known for some time and just sprung it on you when it was too late to change? \n\nIf after 5 years together, your communication is struggling this much, I would seriously question whether you two have a future together. I would have a serious conversation together and bring up these points:\n\n1. Did she not understand that this was supposed to be a romantic getaway for the two of you, and instead, she made it a \"girl's trip\" with you being made to feel like a third wheel?\n2. Why did she not discuss this with you *before* inviting her friends along? That puts you in the position of having to be the bad guy with her friends. A good partner doesn't ambush their partner like that. And when exactly did they get invited? Because 5 days before the trip is really weird timing.\n3. You clearly went to a lot of trouble to plan this trip - did she not understand that you might have had something big planned on this trip?? \n\nIf she was super young, I'd maybe understand this mix up.

It's not manipulative to be honest about the reason he planned the trip and why he was so upset.
