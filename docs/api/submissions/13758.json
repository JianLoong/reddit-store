He thinks I'm being controlling  by asking him to play elsewhere. I feel he's disrespecting me for choosing not to accommodate what is a very simple, reasonable request. I worry he might be right, because he's still mad at me this morning and wouldn't respond. He said \"You leave your laptop out, so it's your fault.\" I don't put it away because I have Multiple Sclerosis, and use it off and on all the time. (mostly on.

He doesn't \"owe\" me help for anything I can do for myself, even if it's hard.\n\nI know, however, that little resentments can accumulate for people helping take care of someone else.

Need that meant health stuff tho. Sooner rather than later.  I guess that shows on how much I\u2019m posting on here.  Hahaha.", "Michigan.  After the accident I tried just working less, then working desk jobs part time.  By the time I was unable to work at all, I was no longer a \u201chigh wage\u201d person and disability payments are based on your previous 3 years of income.  Had I just stopped trying to work I would have been better off ugh.  Sucks.  We lived in Alabama for half of last year.  No property tax and lower cost of living. Hubby is 71 and had some health problems so we moved back here to be close to family.  We will probably owe taxes this year.  No idea how much.  So scary. We are paying $200 more for the mortgage here than we were in Alabama.  I\u2019ve cut out everything I can think of but it\u2019s really hard.  Now hubby needs another operation (hernia) and I\u2019ve got a few months till I\u2019m looking at another spinal surgery.  \n\nI just don\u2019t know how we are expected to live like this. Just so much stress about bills, the future.  I don\u2019t want to worry my kids (grown with families). They are doing the best they can. I\u2019m sure they would help if they could but we are the parents.  I thought by this time in my life I would be spoiling grandkids.  Lol. Well, maybe with tons of love.  And that\u2019s what counts.", "How do you know what I know or experience? And what\u2019s your answer? She should take any stress from her husband bc she has no income and is disabled?? It goes many ways. Mental health is healthcare. Finding a way to make it happen or lobbing representatives to lobby insurance to cover more is key but just bc it isn\u2019t easily accessible for everyone in every state doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be a priority. It sounds like she loves him and wants to make this work. Don\u2019t get mad that I gave them a fair, honest and reasonable suggestion. No one said it was easy. Marriage isn\u2019t easy. Life isn\u2019t easy.", "Going to be hard for her to lobby anyone for anything if her A H husband breaks her laptop. Maybe he kind of wants that to happen...", "You are 100% NTA - not even for \"losing your shit\" and screaming at him.  What else are you supposed to do??\n\nHe's showing a BUNDLE of red flags here.  First, he's doing something you've repeatedly asked him not to do, when there's no real reason to do it his way.  You have a practical reason for him to stop.  You've explained that reason.  His \"reason\" for doing it his way has been proved invalid - he DID hit your laptop.  He knows it upsets you.  Yet HE'S STILL DOING IT.  \n\nSecond, he's gaslighting you into thinking *you're* the unreasonable one.  You aren't.  You aren't demanding he do some weird, pointless thing just to exercise control over him.  HE'S the one doing that, and he KNOWS it upsets you.  In fact, it looks awfully like he's doing it BECAUSE it upsets you.   \n\nThird, when you FINALLY cracked and screamed at him, he's punishing you with the Silent Treatment instead of talking it out like a grown up.  It's another manifestation of control - you're supposed to admit you were wrong and apologise to him.  You weren't and you shouldn't.\n\nI'll go ahead and say what's REALLY worrying me; this is a classic example of emotional abuse.  People with disabilities face higher rates of domestic abuse than the general population, because you're more dependent and therefore more vulnerable.  Does he often do things you find upsetting?  Make it seem like you're a burden?  Tear down your confidence and self-esteem?  Make you feel like you're walking on eggshells?   \n\nWhat would happen to your ability to communicate with others if he \"accidentally\" smashes your laptop?  \n\nI don't know what to tell you to do from here.  Do you have family, friends or a pastor or doctor you can talk about this with?  Can you look up help lines in your area?  I don't want to freak you out but I'm genuinely worried for you.  You deserve better.", "What if he wants to break your laptop so you'll be more dependent on him?", "Look, I agree with that everyone should have health cover but that's not the immediate issue here.  The OP needs help, and has no money.  They can't wait for the entire economic basis of the nation's healthcare to change.", "Is he jealous of you using your laptop? Is he trying to \"accidentally\" damage it so you have to interact with HIM, or just stop you being able to socialize with others?", "Yeah no, at that point it's stonewalling at best, if not intentional cruelty and contempt.", "NTA this is the kind of thing you need to remind 4 year olds of, not a fully grown man. Continuing to throw the ball where you've asked him not to and his petulant pouting after your apology, makes me think he has some real issues with maturity or he's a controlling AH.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE is the AH.", "I\u2019m real petty. Grab the ball, and throw it at his dangly bits. When he complains, tell him that if he can\u2019t respect your room, then you don\u2019t have to respect his body.", "If the laptop is your lifeline, your connection to the world, is it possible he WANTS to \"accidentally\" break it?\nNTA", "NTA. You also shouldn't have apologized, you are the one that needs to.", "Easy NTA.", "NTA, why can\u2019t he take his lazy ass 3 steps outside the front door to play fetch with the dog? Because he\u2019s picking a fight with you on purpose. And when you rightfully freak out, you get the silent treatment.\n\nHoney, this is looking a lot like emotional abuse.", "NTA and you know he's doing it on purpose to get back at you for whatever reason right? He wants to break your laptop and will blame the dog.", "ESH. None of this makes sense. You would struggle to replace this lifeline laptop but leave it in a vulnerable position part blocking a door but there's another route. I wouldn't struggle to replace mine but wouldn't put it at risk like that. \nPlaying fetch inside the house seems a bit bizarre too on any level. Maybe a Chuhuahua with a soft toy but a ball is just plain stupid.\nMaybe if this door isn't needed block it off entirely. Whole situation just screams manufactured for conflict.", "This is just a crazy situation with childish people.\n\nOP - Please don't throw the ball this way.\n\nHusband - Oh ok.\n\nProblem completely solved.", "If he was like this with everything it would be too easy for you to leave", "Semantics. The word you're looking for is semantics, not symantecs.", "Absolutely my thought. OP never seems to leave her nest, she's married but the laptop is the \"only socializing\" she does? He's still a huge asshole but I think the jealousy reasoning here is obvious. He's trying to get her involved in the family and real world and she's refusing."]}
