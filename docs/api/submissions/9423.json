She is a super smart and cute kid, definitely my favorite out of nieces and nephews. However recently she said something slightly out of pocket and I feel a little guilty for laughing at it. We were getting ready to go out to dinner and her mother (my sister in law) was commenting on the jeans she was wearing, talking about how they were sagging around her hips and didn't fit her well. My niece has always been a bit bigger and just recently has started cross country and track and she had lost a ton of weight so I wasn't surprised. She simply said back, \"Well have you seen Dad's jeans? Better saggy than faggy\" with a smile on her face. I couldn't help but burst into laughter at this and it took me a minute or so to register the weight of what she said and that it definitely wasn't appropriate for a 10 year old (or anyone really) to be saying. However I laughed for awhile just because of how she said it and also the fact that I know my brother wears jeans wayyyy too tight and it doesn't look great on him. Her mother later talked to her about why that wasn't okay to say and she gets it now but afterwards, she came up to me and started getting angry with me for laughing at her which she said would only encourage the behavior. I just apologized and said it caught me off guard and I more so thought it was funny she was so quick to string along words like that. Her mother got angry and said it should never be funny\n\nedit: yes I did talk to her afterwards as well, I told her it wasn't cool and I only laughed because I was just shocked and that she should absolutely never say that.", "created_utc": 1675820775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wjtp6/aita_for_laughing_at_my_nieces_use_of_a_slur/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't follow her around and encourage her to say it, you didn't bring it up again after the fact. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that was ENTIRELY out of left field and came from a source you wouldn't reasonably expect.

As a parent, I DO understand laughing at unexpected things that come out of kid mouths (Truck did not sound like Truck when one of my kiddos was 1 1/2) but as an adult in the situation, you gotta be on guard to not laugh at those unexpected thing cause it absolutely gives the impression that it\u2019s okay when it isn\u2019t. You aren\u2019t a parent though, so that\u2019s part of why this is a more gentle YTA. As part of the adult village around your niece, try to be aware next time.", "YTA. A chuckle at unexpected \"humor\" is understandable. But you say you continued to laugh. Is it really funny? You're 23, not a kid anymore. You must know how impressionable children are. They mimic what they see. You are either truly clueless about children or are homophobic. Maybe both.", "The kid didn't know what they were saying was wrong but you knew. It's not your job to parent the kid but we all have to be aware and not encourage certain behaviors which this would have done. YTA", "NTA - I understand how that can happen. When my daughter was also around eight., we were driving somewhere and talking   about her recent youth soccer game, and my daughter blurts out \"what a motherf*****!\". For half a second we laughed as a knee-jerk reaction, then realization hit. Had quite a talk after that, but it was obvious she didn't understand.

The kid is young and needs to be taught better.", "NAH. Her parents should teach her about slurs and what you should and shouldn't say in public places. But you aren't necessarily TA, since she is only 10 and probably uneducated.", "YTA. Would you have laughed if she dropped the n-word? Slurs aren't funny.", "NTA - since the situation was handled and mom explained to the 10 year old why that\u2019s not cool. I would say y t a if this wasn\u2019t the case. It can be hard not to laugh when kids say wild Shit like this tbh. I guess we should all practice our poker faces lol", "YTA laughing at a slur - it\u2019s not cute or funny, it\u2019s used to dehumanize people.", "YTA. \"Faggy\" is not funny, I don't care who says it, you shut that shit down. Yeah, I've laughed when little kids cuss, but this isn't that. Would you have laughed if she'd said \"Better bigger than (n-word)\" ? I doubt it, because it's not funny.", "YTA. Yikes.", "YTA for laughing so openly and continuing to laugh after registering what she\u2019d said. That kind of thing can cause a positive reinforcement. \n\nMy niece was taught a swear word by a \u201crude boy\u201d at nursery and it was *so hard* not to laugh when the little innocent angel said it but I had to stifle it down because laughing at it made her say it more. \n\nIt sounds like you just laughed and didn\u2019t even attempt to say \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t say that word, it\u2019s really unkind\u201d, but left it up to her mother. So I can see why she\u2019s mad at you that she now has to unpick that. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re *an* AH, but I can see why she\u2019s annoyed at you - from her perspective you\u2019ve just laughed at and therefore tacitly encouraged her child to use a slur.\n\nAnd really - why was the slur funny in the first place?", "Honestly wtf. Where did she hear that language? Not appropriate for a kid to say but I understand laughing at that because it's so out of left field. My dad's best friend's daughter (who was only 4 at the time) once said that her brother (7) was being a dick and when I tell you I nearly fell off my chair. It was so funny. She didn't appreciate my laughing though.", "YTA, that's not something you want to reinforce which is what you did, whether intentionally or not.", "YTA.  Homophobic comments/slurs even said in jest are never acceptable and shouldn\u2019t be tolerated.  You\u2019re 23 and one of the adults in that situation, you should know better.  Even if you initially laughed or even smirked, you should\u2019ve spoken up and explained to her in the moment why comments like that are not acceptable.", "YTA. I understand the way she may have said something would make you chuckle but you continued to laugh even after you understood what she said. It seems like she looks up to you and that told her that it was OK to say such things.", "Yta", "NTA.\n\nDunno why the mother is angry at you, her daughter probably learnt the word from her household.", "yikes you're the AH for laughing at a slur you're a terrible rolemodel...you didn't even tell her that it's rude to say it wtf.", "Nta. People need to light up because of the generation we've got. Now, people are going to downvote this and tell me how horrible of a person I must be, but come on, she's 10 her mom told her that was a bad word and yes you should also sit her down and tell her that you also find it's can be hurtful to say that to people but in the context of this with her mom and aunt around her, its a funny story to share with close friends and family.", "NTA. \n\ni say this as a bisexual woman. \n\nthe kids 10, most likely doesn\u2019t know it was a slur, and was corrected by her mother as well as explained to about why you laughed. kids say out of pocket things on the most unexpected times and it\u2019s hard not to laugh, especially when it\u2019s something you\u2019d never think you\u2019d hear.", "yta", "NTA - Humor comes from a lot of unexpected places. Laughter isn't always endorsement.", "NTA because you talked to her afterwards and explained it wasnt funny you just got caught off guard. Kids do that all the time. \n\nMy nephew got me at walmart when he was 4. Some lady called him cute and went to pat his head and he told her \"back off beeeeeoch\". (Still have no clue where he heard it) and smacked her hand karate style. I laughed so hard I cried and the lady was gone before I could stop. I told him later to never say that word again and why but come on..it was hilariously shocking.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nAs an actual homosexual, I bust out laughing just from reading it. I can't even imagine how hard I would be laughing had I actually heard it.\n\nI think how you talked to her about it afterwards is fine. If it happens again, then probably Y T A. But as it happened here? Definitely understandable.", "Especially with kids. \n\nSometimes the laugh just pops out before you can think. \n\nEverything doesn\u2019t have to be an immediate reaction with kids.

Somebody cancel that 10 year old! Dox her DOXXXX HERRRRR! \n\nbro, it's a kid not understanding what she's saying and catching her adults entirely off guard, chill.", "Woah. No, I wouldn't have, and it gives me pause to see how easily YOUR mind was able to come up with that little rhyme there ...", "Or TikTok. There's a fuckton of racism, sexism, homophobia, etc on that app.", "Honestly, people here must never have been around children before.", "That's great.  I'm still laughing.", "Aunts and uncles have zero obligation to the kids.  Of course it's ok to have favorites (so long as you don't tell the kid).  My dad has four siblings, only one lived in the same state as us.  He liked to fish and would take me with him.  I spent way more time with him than any one else, even my brother who hated fishing.  I was obviously his favorite.  And I'm sure the same dynamic exists in all families.", "Oooo that\u2019s a good one.

Just no bro. What kind of sheltered world do you live in where this is cute? Because it\u2019s really not.", "YTA", "Kids saying inappropriate things they don't understand is almost always funny. As long as you correct them and explain why it's inappropriate and don't make a point of encouraging the behavior going forward, then an unintended laugh isn't a bad thing.", "I might be an asshole, but at least I can correctly identify the difference between logical fallacies and literary devices.", "Swears by kids are funny. \n\nSlurs are not funny (because they are hate speech) and need to be shut down immediately.", "You can find humor in absurdity without condoning the slur. Lighten up.", "Agreed."]}
