When I told him no he accused me of being puritanical and not in step with modern ideas, but I said to him that he's been dismissive of drag before now and treated it as a joke, so his argument's a bit hypocritical about wanting me to dress as a guy and us pose as a gay couple.\n\nIsn't us posing as a gay couple insulting to REAL gay couples?\n\nAs it is, AITA here, or is he?

That\u2019s all I have to say. WTF?", "Yeah\u2026 this is concerning. I\u2019d start asking him a bunch of Why questions to deflect. I\u2019d check his computer to see what kind of porn he\u2019s been watching. Even if you say no and you guys don\u2019t do it, now you have a snippet of what\u2019s in his head. Weird.\n\nETA NTA", "Sorry honey, he is trying to make you look and act like a man. He is experimenting with his sexuality and no you don't have to do it.  Its not modern ideas. Modern idea is both of you go guy ans girl and have a great time", "\"No honey, it's not gay if I give a guy a BJ, because you being there turns it into a perfectly normal heterosexual *threesome*\"", "NTA - he is probably gay and only just realised", "NTA. It started out weird enough, wanting to spend *two weeks* in LA. Then it hit a pothole and flew into oncoming traffic. Change your appearance to hang at a gay bar? Gay bars don't check identities at the door so...you should have a serious discussion with him. He might be searching for his truth.", "NTA and your husbands behaviour is super weird. He wants you to cross dress so he has an excuse to go to a gay bar? It sounds to me like your husband wishes you were actually a man and is having major trouble with his sexuality. This is NOT about vacation plans and you need a serious sit down with your husband about why exploring gay bars, to the extent he wants you to change everything about you that makes you feminine is this important to him. There\u2019s a major underlying issue at stake here.", "This is beyond strange.  I was ready for him to ask you to go golfing when neither of you golf, go deep sea fishing when neither of you like to fish, or something like this.  He's asking you to pose as a gay man and go to gay bars.  I have no clue if that's disrespectful to gay people or not but it is definitely disrespectful to you.  You are not gay and, to the best of your knowledge, neither is your husband.  If he wants to go to a gay bar and you're good with it, fine.  But he basically wants you to alter your appearance and dress like a man.  Something is going on.  NTA.", "NTA - That is really weird.   His request is totally unreasonable (wear a binder?!) and then he tries to twist things around and manipulate you by calling you puritanical.\n\nNot it's not puritanical.    How about he wear a binder on his privates for the whole trip and see if he is enjoying it.\n\nDefinitely NTA and I wouldn't take any shit for not going along with his one sided idea.   This is your vacation too.", "Um.... what? \n\nLA itinerary: Lakers, Museum, Zoo, dress as a man & go to gay bars (where families with \u201cwives\u201d don\u2019t go) ... one thing is not like the other here\n\nNTA", "Queer nonbinary person here.\n\nYou know what's \"in step with modern ideas\"? No longer forcing people to dress/act in a way they don't feel comfortable with to fit into a social situation they don't want to be in. \n\nIf YOU wanted to dress in drag and present as a MM couple that would be fine. If you knew that was a fetish of his and you wanted to play along for him that would also be fine.\n\nHim telling you to do it with no discussion and then trying to shame you by calling you puritanical is NOT OK.\n\nDON'T do this for him until you guys have talked. A LOT. I'd encourage you guys to do some reading surrounding the kink community, because even if this isn't actually a kink for him, the methods of open discussion and negotiating boundaries would be very helpful for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut also way above Reddit's pay grade. You might want to book some counselling sessions for the two of you.", "So you can go to a gay bar without pretending. If he really wanted to dress the part he could go in drag. What he wants you to do is not be you, and that's not cool. I won't even dive into the obvious potential undertones here. NTA", "NTA  He's trying to tell you something.", "NTA.  There is nothing outdated about not wanting to change your preferred gender presentation.  He isn't treating you like a person,  he is treating you like a sex toy.   That's not okay.   Idgaf what his sexual preferences are,  its not okay to make demands like this and try to guilt someone into agreeing. \nYou v are well within reason to hold firm on your no.  I think he may benefit from being honest about what he is looking for.", "NTA - This is a pretty weird request on his part. I mean... yeah I think I'd be looking at him differently. Because he wants to change YOU. And cut your hair?? Uhh....", "NTA. I think you two should consider relationship counseling to unpack this. If you\u2019re not trans, and he\u2019d like a trans partner, you\u2019ve got a disconnect. \n\nDo whatever is fun in LA, but this would made me uncomfortable too.", "Wtf did I just read?\nNTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not being puritanical to not want to  misgender yourself for an entire vacation.", "Nta.  \n\nBut he wants to go out to gay bars and care like a gay couple?  I think you should take the hint here.", "NTA! Your worries are definitely valid, and why should you be forced to do something you\u2019re clearly uncomfortable with while on a supposed fun getaway? \n\nIt could be he\u2019s got feelings he wants to explore and this is his way of including you in that process, so perhaps there\u2019s a way to dig deeper into that without putting him on defense. I\u2019m sure people with more experience will have better insight into a situation like this. BTW, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call him the asshole here, it takes guts to open up about something like this, especially 17 years in. I imagine he\u2019s quite vulnerable. Good luck!", "NTA. \n\nDifferent couples have different comfort levels as far as role play, dress up etc. but as you posted that this request was shocking to you, then I\u2019m going to assume that role play may be something that the two of you don\u2019t typically engage in. And you mentioned that he\u2019s not been accepting of crossdressing people in the past. How has his general attitude about the LGBTQ community been over the past dozen years?\n\nHe\u2019s got something going on in his head that he\u2019s not being fully transparent about, and I supposed there\u2019s a possibility of it going in two different directions. \n\nThe first, which others pointed out, is that he may be realizing he\u2019s been suppressing his own homosexuality or bisexuality which he wants to explore. He feels \u201csafe\u201d exploring that in a big city across the country. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know that heterosexual people can go to gay bars as themselves? \n\nBut asking you to cut your hair? That\u2019s just something that can\u2019t be undone in a night. No. You do not have to consent to that, and saying no once should be the end of that request. I\u2019m all in favor of people being open and accepting about their own sexuality. But he needs to understand that when you are in a marriage, that process can be very difficult and painful for their spouse as well. A couple will need support and guidance through that. Asking you to be his plaything while he stands in front of you fantasizing about someone else is emotionally abusive. \n\nSo, if it\u2019s not the case that he\u2019s having gay thoughts (I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t get that number from The Book of Mormon show out of my head), then the other motive might be worse. Maybe he\u2019s looking for you to disguise yourself because his motive is hate filled toward the LGBTQ community and he\u2019s planning to commit a crime, or gather intel for a group of radicals who may want to commit a crime. \n\nEither way, I think you do need to check out his internet history and try to figure out what his motivation is, so you know how best to safely approach this situation.", "FYI: OP, he's gay. Just in case neither of you realize, he's gay.", "So how does he know about the gay bar vibe. You\u2019re NTA and he is not for at least communicating what he wants but there are so many clubs and bars in LA why the gay bar. Something is going on here big time.", "NTA\n\nRarely I find myself at a loss of words, but this. Oh my goodness.....I can't.\n\nOk so I would just add maybe he is curious and wants to maybe experiment since he can't with a real guy.(I know some people who were straight as a pole with 2 kinds wearing a tutu and wig at pride)\n\nOr maybe this could be some genius friends idea to spice up life(yup a very high possibility)", "NTA. If you are not comfortable with something sexual, your partner should be understanding of that.", "Good luck having a good vacation. You nta. If this is truly out of nowhere, it's pretty seriously different, and I don't know where he would think you would just be like oh okay no problem sounds fun", "NTA. Y\u2019all can literally just go to a gay bar as a normal couple. Him wanting you to not only dress as a man, but to pretend to be a gay couple is also kinda wtf, you know? \n\nAfter this vacation, y\u2019all may wanna invest in some counseling, because there\u2019s something deeper here, for sure.", "If this role play doesn't interest you, don't do it. If it is as weird to you as it is to me, run. If it isn't, the pair of you could come up with an idea to play let's pretend that you're both on board with.", "You live in Texas. Of course your husband  hasn\u2019t shown any gay tendencies. \n\nHe is questioning his sexuality and wants to explore it in a safe environment to see if that\u2019s what makes him happy.  \n\nSorry.", "He sounds like he has a trans guy fetish. As a trans guy myself I get a lot of attention from straight dudes", "INFO \n\nAre you a somewhat boyish/gamine looking woman? petite? asian?\n\nMy point being: perhaps this has been coming for a long time. Often  women with that kind of boyish physique are the last stop a closeted man makes before he comes out.", "NTA, and Im HORRENDOUSLY curious to see if we get an update; it sounds like he's exploring his sexuality and trying to use you to do it. It's awfully immature of him if that is indeed the case; I'd hope someone you spent so much of your life life might at least have enough respect to sit down and have an actual discussion about whats going on instead of just springing this (frankly baffling) situation on you.", "Someone\u2019s peeking out of the closet! \n\nIf he wants to explore his sexuality, then that\u2019s absolutely wonderful. He does not get to make you change everything about you in quite a serious way in order to do that. Seems like he\u2019s got some figuring out to do, and Maybe WITH you, instead of, ya know, demanding you change everything physically about you? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI hope you manage to have a nice vacation!", "Being in step with modern ideas means letting people be themselves.  That's not what he is asking for here.\n\nNta", "What is going on in TX?  Seriously...nta", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know if your husband is being very clumsy about exploring his sexuality or if he\u2019s making some dumb and dangerous choices but this whole story is red-flag city. I truly think that you should not go on this vacation until he\u2019s honest about all of his motives. I wouldn\u2019t go until you\u2019re established with a couples\u2019 counselor, frankly.\n\nBecause, it\u2019s not his possible interest in men that worries me here (though I can\u2019t imagine how this must feel as someone who felt they were one half of a hetero couple up until now), it\u2019s his complete dismissal of you as an autonomous person. *Wear this. Cut that. Grow this. Pretend you\u2019re a man. We\u2019re going to a leather bar! Yeah we\u2019ll hit a few tourist traps. Two weeks of it! Good times, eh\u203d*\n\nHe also hasn\u2019t shared his expectations with you outside of the \u201cshallow\u201d side of things. If you\u2019re meant to go to L.A. gay bars (so far from home and hearth), what\u2019s the point of the makeover? I\u2019m a straight woman who bartended at a gay bar for five years; the owners knew I was straight, customers who asked knew, and plenty of straight folks came through. Wasn\u2019t an issue unless you were being a jerk, and jerks know no gender/orientation, so all jerks were happily escorted out.\n\nMy point being, show up as who you are, the gay bar scene doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s right about the atmosphere of *some* gay bars- they are a lot more relaxing than places where kiddos are running amok. But hubby doesn\u2019t sound like he just wants a chill evening without the trappings of family dining around him. He doesn\u2019t even want to be there with you, as he mentioned they\u2019re not places for wives. He wants you there presenting as his male partner.\n\nAgain I\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s in the wrong for what he may be going through regarding his own sexuality. I am very uneasy with how he\u2019s deputizing you in this adventure without considering possible ramifications though.", "Nta your husband is asking a lot of you, if you don't feel like genderplay you shouldn't be pressured. Counciling or find a way to get your husband to realize the awkward position he's putting you in.", "Your husband says he's not gay? This is fruity and he doesn't see you as a person, but a tool he can manipulate into fullfilling his fantasies. It doesn't matter what his sexuality is, it matters that he's moving you around in his life like a chess piece. He wants certain things but that MUST involve going against how you feel as a gender or you're wrong? \n\nHe sucks, the way he's treating you sucks.", "neither of you are the ah. i wouldn't deny him the \"exploration\" but you should be allowed to decide the part you play and the wardrobe for it.", "YTA And husband is a little wacky. You can go to a gay bar as a heterosexual couple. Gay people have seen \"straights\" before, or at least seen them on TV, and learned not to look down on them anymore.

So my question here is why you couldn\u2019t just go as yourself? I\u2019m not saying *you* wouldn\u2019t be okay with that, but rather wondering why your hubby doesn\u2019t want that? Why does he specifically want you to go in disguise? \n\nHe\u2019s asking you to change your appearance with a binder, that\u2019s one thing, but letting your leg hair grow\u2014which, unless you go in shorts, nobody would see anyway, unless there was bedroom action\u2014and cutting your hair (as opposed to wearing a wig). These things aren\u2019t adding up to me. \n\nHe may have some previously undisclosed kink, and I\u2019m not kink shaming in any way. But he wants to go on a vacation whereby his wife pretends to be a man. Is that *just* while you\u2019re at gay bars, and the rest of the time you get to be yourself? Is he planning on asking you to use a different name? Because unless your own name is one that both men and women can use, he\u2019d be changing your name for the night/vacation as a whole, so that you can pass as a man. \n\nAnd it seems to me that if he is indeed wanting you to pass as a man in a gay bar, then if a guy hits on you both, it\u2019s going to spell trouble if there\u2019s any bedroom action and the guy notices your lack of male genitalia. Unless you disclose you\u2019re a woman before anything happened, any guy would have a right to his feelings over being lied to, but it could get dangerous. It seems overly risky to me. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure any of this is a good idea for you. Have you told him this makes you feel uncomfortable? As your husband, he should understand and accept that. If he doesn\u2019t, then you may need to reevaluate things as they stand.", "NTA. You can totally go to a gay bar without chopping off tire hair and letting your leg hair grow! That's nonsense! Does your husband not understand lesbians exist? Mtf trans people might still frequent gay bars? A gay  man  might bring his straight female bestie to a gay bar. Nobody is gonna kick you out. Try a dry run in Houston if you don't believe me.", "NTA. Seems strange to plan a two week vacation to LA around going to gay bars and pretending to be a gay couple.   You can do that in Texas\u2026.unless he doesn\u2019t want to run into anyone he knows.", "NTA.  There is only one gay club that I ever heard someone make a comment about women being there.  That was The Eagle in Chicago, which is (or was?) a leather bar.  The \"atmosphere\" as he wants to call it was black everything with huge screens showing very close up shots of very male...intimacy.  I would bet all the money in my pocket the name comes from spread eagle, and not uncle Sam eagle.  This might be a chain of bars, so maybe do some research about what you would be getting yourself into, so to speak.\n\nI think you should probably call the Eagle in CA and ask them what they think about this plan. I also think you should go to a gay bar with him closer to where you live to see how he acts and reacts.  He didn't just come up with this place without doing some research, so do some research yourself and ask him why this place in particular?  And why do you have to change your gender?  Or is his end game that you refuse so he can say that he will go himself just to \"see\" what it is all about?  \n\nWhat is your husband's plan if some dudes are actually drunk/high/rolling enough to actually buy your ruse? Is he expecting you to go off with them for a moment of unpleasant discovery?  Does he plan to protect you in case someone takes it poorly?  \n\n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to make your vacation about his fantasy.  And you have much more to figure out than what bar you go to.", "NTA yeah he's gay or on his way. And why are you supposed to carry the load of changing your appearance to suit his needs on a couples' vacation? And do you personally want to visit any of the locations he wants to go to? Sounds like he wants a wingman. And the possibilty of you getting stuck alone at the bar while he takes some vacation strange back to the hotel room.", "NTA! His request is very strange. \n\nNo matter what his motivation, he has NO right to demand you change your appearance and pretend to be something you are not.", "This is quite bizarre. He clearly wants to explore his sexuality / role play, but squashing your very valid questions / opinions as puritanical is ridiculous. Your husband is being a total AH. If you do go on this trip I hope you can enjoy it, as yourself, and not feel pressured into anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable with.

You weren\u2019t disrespectful about it or anything, you just don\u2019t feel comfortable and that\u2019s perfectly understandable and not at all your fault. \n\nHe\u2019s being kind of an AH about it though as it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s taking your feelings into consideration. It sounds more like he just wants you to go along with his idea, shut up, and look pretty, or rather masculine, as it were. If he wants to experiment with his sexuality then that\u2019s a conversation y\u2019all need to have, but trying to force someone to do something they aren\u2019t okay with isn\u2019t the way. \n\nFrom the sound of it, it seems like he\u2019s confused and has some thinking to do. Maybe he was so judgmental and rude about drag shows because it\u2019s something he wants to do, but might feel like it\u2019s wrong therefore is upset at the people who *do* do it since they are able to be themselves while he doesn\u2019t feel like he can be.\n\nEither way, you\u2019re NTA and you and your husband need to have a very open and honest conversation. Something is up and now it\u2019s just a matter of dealing with it, but the right way, meaning actively listening to each other, trying to understand one another, and being completely honest. Good luck!", "Nta but I have concerns about you husband", "NTA If your husband is having questions about his sexuality and is curious, thats okay.  Its like hes testing the waters to see if he can handle being seen with a man, without actually being with a man. You two need a serious talk asap. He may be BI or Pan or what ever floats his boat, but he needs to be real with you. I think he feels safer trying things out away from home in a more open environment than it is in Texas, which I cant really blame him for.  Its up to you if you want to help him explore but I might draw the line at a masculine haircut. You'll be stuck with that for wks afterwards.", "Nta, California is a shit hole right now especially in LA", "He's gay. Soooooo gay.", "Sorry but this sounds ridiculously fake to me", "Highly doubt this is real.  And if it is your husband is gay.  You are NTA for not wanting to do that shit, if it's real.  Which it isn't", "NTA. And there\u2019s way more to this than he is admitting. He is for sure struggling with his sexuality.", "Ummmm there are deeper issues than the vacation.

I may be fat and old now, but I was young and adventuresome then. \n\nSo honestly I'd call his bluff, because I'd be OK with experimentation.  \"Honey, why bother changing how I look?

I walk into this thinking I\u2019m going to call someone an asshole for not wanting to go see the Hollywood sign with their overly excited husband and instead I\u2019m just sitting here way too high for this shit. \n\nAlso NTA though.", "NTA I guess", "This was my reaction too", "Wow, that\u2019s a beautiful idea!", "Wonderful idea!! \n\nWell he would say it's not the same \ud83d\ude44", "I just thought she didn\u2019t want to go to Alcatraz or something.", "Nothing else is needed.", "Okay, so your comment made me laugh. \n\nBut\u2026 what about if there\u2019s a real threesome situation where a guy wants a threesome with them, assuming they\u2019re both male? He\u2019s going to have issues with that (unless he\u2019s bi) once they get to the bedroom and he sees she\u2019s lacking a penis \ud83d\udc40 \nI\u2019m not a gay man (I\u2019m a straight woman, in fact), but I would get angry about feeling lied to (unless they plan to disclose she\u2019s actually female beforehand) and that could spell danger for them both, but highly likely mostly her for \u201clying\u201d.", "for sure experimenting", "> It started out weird enough, wanting to spend two weeks in LA. \n\nRight? That'd be a divorce right there for me. The Horror.", "Binders are no joke and need to be the proper fit. They can't be worn for long periods of time.\n\nAlso why LA for 2 WEEKS??? that's a long time.", "After reading OP\u2019s post all I could think was \u201cwtf did I just read?\u201d And that stood out to me too, there is a huge spectrum of \u201cbar\u201d atmospheres to choose from. He\u2019s either questioning his sexuality or he wants to go to gay bars to gawk.", "An excellent answer. NTA", "OP's husband is apparently  Butters' dad.", "Nope - I'm petite and look more like Bebe Rexha who isn't very boyish-looking!", "Did you just not read the post up until one of the last few sentences? OP doesn't mind going to a gay bar. OP minds going to a gay bar whilst posing as a gay couple when they're not, in fact, a gay couple.", "Maybe read the entire post before commenting\u2026", "You clearly skipped an entire section of this if you think OP is an AH for not wanting to completely change her appearance and pretend to be a man for her entire two week vacay just because her husband wants to be gay in LA.", "This is so much more than just not wanting to go to a gay bar (which OP is fine with, actually). Her husband is requesting she make very specific changes and gender swap while she\u2019s out with him. That\u2019s not just \u201cwacky,\u201d that\u2019s deceitful-especially if intimacy is a possibility- and potentially dangerous to OP if/when someone realizes they penis they\u2019d been anticipating is actually a vagina.", "Did you read the post?\nWhere is it said that she dies'nt want to go in a gay bar?", "I just smoked, hoped on reddit and saw this post so I am right there with you", "Many years ago, when waxing for men was just starting to be a thing, I had a spa day and asked the beautician if she had done that yet. She said the funny thing is that men all think it can\u2019t hurt that much because if it did, we wouldn\u2019t do it, so they were all really surprised. She said every single first timer yelled FUCK! and then apologised", "Just snorted my morning coffee when I read this comment. Well done!", "Oh wow, yes! You are right! You  followed it to the logical conclusion!  There's gonna be one (or more) traumatized LA gay guy.", "Tbf it's honesty hard to transform into an unclockable male-presenting person without really working on it. Drag kings are talented as hell. I doubt a binder and haircut on an unenthuastic OP would be enough to \"fool\" a guy who's looking to hook up with two men. Idk though, you bring up a valid concern for sure.", "> Bebe Rexha\n\n*Googles Bebe Rexha*\n\n\n\nWhoa!  Yeah, that's about as womanly as it's possible to be! This is where the armchair psychologists will dive in \u2014 \"ah yes, he's overcompensating\" *strokes chin wisely* :-)\n\nMight you be interested to do it for one night only?  The leg hair thing is absurd: who wears shorts to a bar? but you could drag up as a bloke for one evening and see how it goes. But of course, while that's a compromise, that's not really a solution to whatever the fuck is going on in his head. I think this is time for mandatory counselling time: a bit for couples and a lot for him individually.", "I'm in the same boat. High as a kite and wondering wtf I just read....", "I wasn\u2019t meaning to question you, if what I said should have been obvious by your comment. Sorry if I offended. It\u2019s hard to interpret certain things via text rather than tone, for me.", "She shouldn\u2019t have to do it at all. OP has expressed that she isn\u2019t into the idea at all. Therefore she doesn\u2019t do it for any nights and they need counseling immediately", "What, no? I'm not offended! I thought your comment was BRILLIANT! I loved it!!  <<THIS IS NOT SARCASM!", "Sorry. I literally have such a hard time sometimes realising whether something I read is sarcastic. It\u2019s why I put /s when I\u2019m being sarcastic, as sometimes with the things I say, I know it could get misinterpreted. Sarcasm is always harder to detect by words on a screen than tone of voice. Especially with strangers. \n\nThat aside though, I\u2019m a bit worried about OP. As I asked in a comment, does he want her to play a guy the whole time or just in gay bars? Does he intend to give her a new name for the trip/nights out? It could get really dangerous. Especially if a gay man goes with them assuming they\u2019re both guys and then realises he\u2019s been deceived. This is not something I\u2019d feel comfortable doing at all. The guy would have a right to his feelings over being deceived, but then if he gets angry and his reaction is violence\u2026 Yeah, just no. It\u2019s not a good idea.", ">whether something I read is sarcastic.\n\n\nyeah it can be hard to tell.", "Sometimes people poke fun at me meanly. Sometimes it\u2019s sarcasm. And I don\u2019t do conflict/drama, so I find it hard to address and fall back on my people-pleasing, apologetic ways."]}
