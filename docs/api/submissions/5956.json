What you don\u2019t do though is pull the children into it. \n\nThere was a lot of drama happening within my family while I was a child, on multiple fronts, but I only became aware of it when I hit my teens because the adults kept us out of it. It was a THEM problem, not an US problem. \n\nWhat your wife did was take a potshot at your mother in front of your children, making them participants in it.

Enfolding your children with the family drama when they're young  and impressionable is very inappropriate.

How could you stand there and let your wife say such a horrible thing to your mother, right in front of her? I think there's a reason your father doesn't like your wife. She sounds like a piece of work. The way you stood by and did nothing as your wife disrespected your mother is horrible. You deserved to be banned from their house and disinvited from the trip. If your father is really abusive and cruel, why do you still associate with him? You and your own wife didn't seem to have a problem being around him as long as you got to go on a free vacation. By your wife's own words, that makes the both of you \"weak and selfish\". It probably isn't because you care that much about your mom if you condone the way your wife treats her. Your inaction speak volumes. Despicable.\n\nAnd if your father really is abusive, your wife verbally attacked an abuse survivor.

Sounds like your wife is also an asshole and that's why she and your father don't get along.\n\nYTA for not buying your own mother a gift. You let your wife, who you KNOW doesn't like your parents, choose her gift which of course is gonna be subpar.\n\nYTA for agreeing to go on a vacation with people who you know are going to butt heads and who don't like each other.\n\nYTA for getting upset that your father rescinded the invitation after the way you and your family treat them.\n\nYTA for thinking that it's the amount of gifts received is what makes someone happy. You support your MIL who is lonely and that is genuinely great! But to then say that your gift doesn't matter since your mom \"makes out like a bandit\" every year as you said is such an awful take. The gift is to show you love and appreciate her. Your wife's gift to her shows that you don't.\n\nYou need to apologize to your mother first of all. Second is keep your wife and your parents separate from each other. Try to make playdates between your mother and kids while your wife is elsewhere relaxing. Have separate Christmas celebrations where you go to your MIL on Christmas and to your mom's on the Eve or a couple days before/after. That way your wife gets her Christmas with her mom and you and kids can still go separately to a celebration with your mom. There are many ways you can make this work but until your wife and dad learn to be respectful to one another then you need to figure something that works for everyone until then. Or take the easier route of apologizing to your mother and telling her you're going low contact.", "YTA. You guys can say what you want, tbh I don\u2019t care about that.

That makes her a bully and the weakest of all.\n\nEdit: OP comments paints the picture that the dad is an AH because that\u2019s his personal opinion from his experiences.

But I'm going to say that there's such a thing as reactive abuse, and this whole scenario has a whiff of it. Sometimes things take years to finally come to a head, and this finally popped like the festering poison it was. Your Dad being pissed that his wife received a \"lesser gift\" than your wife got her own mother.... that's a lot of ego there, and the Narcs always expect to be the \"most favored\" and highest status.

Sometimes kids with wounded feelings don't want to talk to anyone and just want to sulk because they're upset and that's the only way they can express that emotion.

Chances are, your mom is trying to play the role of peace keeper which is typical in a dysfunctional family situation. \n\nNext time just thank her for the gift she brought over and be upset with the person who cancelled the trip, not the person who\u2019s being nice to you. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that your dad set a poor example for you as you were growing up.

You are adults and your parents do not owe you a vacation or anything else at this point.\n\nI\u2019m not so sure that the father is quite the asshole OP says he is. He wasn\u2019t upset at what he received from OP and wife. He was upset about what they gifted mom. That\u2019s not typical of someone who is as selfish as OP implies the father is. OP also seems very envious that his father is apparently retired or otherwise independently wealthy. Note that not only does OP remain in contact but so does his wife. Making it certainly appear that they are willing to leech off someone that they neither love nor respect. That\u2019s really gross behavior.\nSince OP\u2019s post reeks of entitlement and self importance, I\u2019m going with OP and his wife being huge flaming AHs and, sadly, they are doing their very best to pass their entitlement on to the kids. I hope that OP\u2019s mother realizes that OP and his wife are leeches and shakes them off. \nPut on your big boy pants and buy your own family vacation, OP.", "Godamn you're an hypocrit asshole buddy, I can't believe anyone would write this post and not see it.", "Let's see if I'm getting this correctly... \n\nYour mom got less gifts than your wife's mom, your dad likely noticed she was or would become upset, so he defended his wife from feeling less than your wife's mom.

(I'm not my mom's biggest fan either, but I don't involve children in my b.s.)\n\nInstead of being an adult, you tried to stay out of it and it all blew up in your face. \n\nIt sounds like you and your wife are definitely the ahole. Your dad probably is as well, but he has more adult experience with your mom than you, and is probably better at reading her than you are. \n\nMaybe you and your wife can discuss in which topics are and aren't appropriate to involve your children. \n\nThis could've all been solved with a group conversation between the 4 adults. It sounded like a massive misunderstanding that you all kept piling onto until you ran to Reddit. \n\nSwallow your pride, and apologize for the misunderstanding and forget about the vacation.", "YTA and do is your wife.\n\nWhat your wife said oozed entitlement and it's beyond inappropriate to say.

Info - why does your dad dislike your wife? \n\nSecondly, how do we know he\u2019s actually a bad guy and your mom is weak and selfish?

Even claims it is because she never cried as a kid, like kids aren't supposed to cry.\n\n> He openly jokes about not wanting kids but having them to make my mom happy. He laughs about how she didn't want them either past a certain age\n\n> He was jealous of his kids and competed for my mom's attention\n\nSo, he's not a good father but he is a good husband. Maybe that's why your mom stays with him. The guy never wanted children but had them just for her and probably still tolerates them for her.\n\nAnd you think she should leave him because he doesn't like his grown, adult children? A man who loves and cares for her?\n\n> He is extremely judgmental to anyone who couldn't just pull themselves out of poverty as he did. \n\nAlright, so he's a hard worker who managed to raise himself out of poverty.\n\n> He refuses to acknowledge that most people couldn't do what he did. \n\nWhy does he have to acknowledge anything? His life, his convictions. As long as he isn't hurting anybody, why does it matter? Doesn't make him an asshole.\n\n> He makes fun of people who complain about work, but has to take off constantly to go sailing, skips work all the time, and acts like he has any right to talk.\n\n\nHe's rich enough that he doesn't have to constantly worry about his job. He earned that by working hard when he had to. Now, it's his time to relax. So he does have the right to talk. Someone who can't afford a trip unless daddy shells out cash doesn't have any right to criticize how someone spends their hard-earned money.\n\n\n> He is a liar. He claims he can't do certain things (praise, affection) yet can do it with my mom.\n\n\nSo he praises and shows affection to the woman he loves. But not to the children who resent him. I wonder why.\n\n > He moaned about having to go to a kids soccer game but has gone to every one of her performances when it isn't even his thing.\n\nSo, despite it not being his thing, he goes to the performances of the woman he loves. He shows interest in what his wife is doing. This man sounds like a pretty great husband. I see why your mother loves him.\n\n\n\n> He cheats at everything because he is so competitive he can't let a five year old win. He is so insecure he once couldn't figure out some puzzle thing my mom bought during covid, so he paid for a fully constructed one on Amazon and tried to say he did it.\n\nAgain, that doesn't make him an asshole. Petty? Yes.\n\n> He makes snide comments about everything, people's appearances, homes, jobs, literally everything\n\nThe only thing you've said that makes him sound like an asshole.\n\n> He admits he is a hardass at work and none of his employees like him. \n\nSo? There are different styles of management and not everyone cares about being liked by their staff.\n\n\n> He lets my mom throw fits and thinks it is funny\n\nLets? Is she a strong, independent, rich, beautiful woman or is she your fathers slave? Lets?\n\n> He claims he is embarrassed by his ex wife because she doesn't have a college degree and has a tattoo, so no one can know she exists\n\nEveryone has partners they're ashamed of. Why does anyone have to know his marital history? That's private and his choice to keep private.\n\nHonestly, you sound insufferable and entitled, OP.

If Op's mom let her husband be an asshole to the kids mother, fuck her.\nI applaud op for standing by his wife on the contrary. Op's mom is a bad role model of she's enabling her husband and it's crucial that the children understand that. I've seen it in my close family, ruined my mom cause my grandma never wanted to divorce her awful husband and tried to \"fix\" what he's done while meddling in her daughter's family. Weak and selfish are exactly the words. I loved that woman as a mother, but that's the truth.\n\nBest advice to OP is that if you father is truly an asshole, it's ok to not love him and go no contact, your kids will be better of that for sure.", "I see what you're doing.

OP has to keep pretending to love his mom, so he is sure to be in the will and inherit all those nice money he keeps mentioning she has (from her family).
