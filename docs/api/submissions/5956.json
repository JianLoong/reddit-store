What you don\u2019t do though is pull the children into it. \n\nThere was a lot of drama happening within my family while I was a child, on multiple fronts, but I only became aware of it when I hit my teens because the adults kept us out of it. It was a THEM problem, not an US problem. \n\nWhat your wife did was take a potshot at your mother in front of your children, making them participants in it. They were collateral for your father\u2019s decision (which was a response to a choice you and your wife made\u2026.so you may possibly be the source of the issue after all) but your wife brought them into it. \n\nAnd what does it say about you and your wife, that your father is an arsehole but you are happy to take a free vacation from him.

Enfolding your children with the family drama when they're young  and impressionable is very inappropriate.

How could you stand there and let your wife say such a horrible thing to your mother, right in front of her? I think there's a reason your father doesn't like your wife. She sounds like a piece of work. The way you stood by and did nothing as your wife disrespected your mother is horrible. You deserved to be banned from their house and disinvited from the trip. If your father is really abusive and cruel, why do you still associate with him? You and your own wife didn't seem to have a problem being around him as long as you got to go on a free vacation. By your wife's own words, that makes the both of you \"weak and selfish\". It probably isn't because you care that much about your mom if you condone the way your wife treats her. Your inaction speak volumes. Despicable.\n\nAnd if your father really is abusive, your wife verbally attacked an abuse survivor.

Sounds like your wife is also an asshole and that's why she and your father don't get along.\n\nYTA for not buying your own mother a gift. You let your wife, who you KNOW doesn't like your parents, choose her gift which of course is gonna be subpar.\n\nYTA for agreeing to go on a vacation with people who you know are going to butt heads and who don't like each other.\n\nYTA for getting upset that your father rescinded the invitation after the way you and your family treat them.\n\nYTA for thinking that it's the amount of gifts received is what makes someone happy. You support your MIL who is lonely and that is genuinely great! But to then say that your gift doesn't matter since your mom \"makes out like a bandit\" every year as you said is such an awful take. The gift is to show you love and appreciate her. Your wife's gift to her shows that you don't.\n\nYou need to apologize to your mother first of all. Second is keep your wife and your parents separate from each other. Try to make playdates between your mother and kids while your wife is elsewhere relaxing. Have separate Christmas celebrations where you go to your MIL on Christmas and to your mom's on the Eve or a couple days before/after. That way your wife gets her Christmas with her mom and you and kids can still go separately to a celebration with your mom. There are many ways you can make this work but until your wife and dad learn to be respectful to one another then you need to figure something that works for everyone until then. Or take the easier route of apologizing to your mother and telling her you're going low contact.", "YTA. You guys can say what you want, tbh I don\u2019t care about that.

That makes her a bully and the weakest of all.\n\nEdit: OP comments paints the picture that the dad is an AH because that\u2019s his personal opinion from his experiences.

But I'm going to say that there's such a thing as reactive abuse, and this whole scenario has a whiff of it. Sometimes things take years to finally come to a head, and this finally popped like the festering poison it was. Your Dad being pissed that his wife received a \"lesser gift\" than your wife got her own mother.... that's a lot of ego there, and the Narcs always expect to be the \"most favored\" and highest status.
