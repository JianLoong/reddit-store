This week before Thanksgiving I gave a final project on a unit. I explained the directions and gave them several choices for how they wanted to present the material. I also informed them this would be a test grade and that since the material would not be used going forward they could not turn it in after the deadline. I let their parents know as well. During the period I made sure to tell students I was available with any questions they had about the project and answered and gave examples for those who asked. However, a bunch of students chose not to use their time effectively and played on their phones, watched movies or played games on their computers. These are the same students who have done this all year. At this point I decided not to intervene and to simply let them waste their own time and fail. When the missing project caused a lot of them drop to a failing grade I got many angry emails from parents. I explained that they had two full hours to complete the project in class and an additional week at home. I explained the consequences of not turning the project in to the students AND parents and still this occurred and that class time should\u2019ve been more effectively used instead of doing other things.

I\u2019m a veteran teacher myself and have had to give failing test grades out for projects before but that\u2019s only after repeated in class reminders, multiple reminder notes home and a couple of classes detailing the project and having them actively work on it. If they still can\u2019t get it done then that on them. And I\u2019d like to add that even with all that make sure you\u2019re willing to listen to some kids one on one about why it isn\u2019t done  just because there\u2019s always one kid with a legitimate reason why it\u2019s not done.

Then sees who do it.", "NTA for failing them but in all honesty kids are dumb and I agree they need to learn to take school seriously. There could be options like letting them turn it in late for half points, or adding more to the project (i.e. waste more of their time). \n\nI had teachers who refused to budge at all and they were viewed as being AHs because of it.

Learning doesn't happen if the outcome is magically removed.", "NTA.  You laid out the roadmap for them to follow and they chose to ignore you, sometimes the best teacher can be Failure.", "NTA! \nWhen I was in school I was a straight A student despite my ADHD. I would work so hard and be stressed out a lot, but I got my shit done. Then I'd go into class and find that since so many other kids didn't do the work and would fail the teacher caved and either extended time or made the project simpler. It drove me crazy, like my hard work didn't matter in the end. I can think of this happening even once when I was in college. I know it's partially because the school system is set up in a way the a bunch of failing students actually impact the teacher's performance more than their own, but still it would piss me off.", "NTA.  If they don't want to be bothered with the assignment, they can deal with the consequences.  No work, no grade.  I don't know what's so hard to understand about that.", "NTA\n\n\nFinally a teacher who has balls.\nI wish they would do this at my kids school.\nYou told everyone so the ones who didn't find there kids important enough to help them are AH.", "NTA at all", "NTA. I have a 14 year old. If she pulled this shit, I'd be telling her that this is the consequence of not getting her work done.", "Nope, you did your job.  They all just learned a very valuable lesson, and all of the kids you failed just educated the rest of the school that you're a tough teacher.", "NTA - I like the term \"Fucked around and found out\"  which is exactly what the kids did. Stay firm in your decision you are NTA. Too many kids always get a pass in school. I watch kids with end of year scores of F just get pushed to the next grade. It was always bizarre.", "NTA. But you know parents.  They don't care about reason and logic.  And many won't do what they need to do to get their kids in line.  The reality of today is many administrators don't want the hassle of holding the line.  Parents just want the grades, and so do kids. The only ones that are holding people accountable are the teachers.  So expect no matter how many warnings you give, that when the parent comes in to have your head, that they will say you should have given one more.\n\nYou not only have to be in the right, you have to get them to commit to what they would accept as you doing enough to justify the bad grade.  And then show them the extra evidence that proves it. \n\nI have a friend who caught a kid cheating by having his phone in his lap during a test.  His word that the kid was using his phone wasn't enough.  He had to wait until the parent came in and get them to admit that if he actually had a picture that this kid was using his phone then they would agree to a zero.  And then he showed them the picture he took from the back of the room showing the kid doing exactly what he said.  They were soooo pissed.  I am surprised that they didn't say he was just checking his horoscope during the test and try to get him off that way.", "I would say NTA, however, kids should not be allowed to use their phones in class.  Yes they have to learn to control their usage, but for some it is overwhelming.\nIf they couldn\u2019t use phones and still screwed around, yes fail them.  But I think it\u2019s your job to remove that oh so seductive distraction.", "You gave them class time and homework time, made the deadline and conditions clear to both the students and parents AND offered opportunities for them to get help, so NTA. \nTeachers have too much put on them as it is. Coddling 14-15 year olds isn't something you should have to take on as well. My child (14) recently missed a deadline like this, despite my efforts (so much effort lol). I made him complete and submit it anyway and emailed the teacher that we would be grateful for any feedback but absolutely understood that the assignment wouldn't count and that any feedback was 100% up to him, not a demand. \nMy opinions on the school system and teaching methods are a moot point unless I choose to spend my time and energy to contribute to solutions. In adult life you will have to deal with inflexible situations that you may not agree with, so it is a lesson they need to learn. Failing as assignment is a significant consequence, but not as big as ones they could face in later life.", "NTA. You are trying to teach them to become responsible and successful. You were clear about the expectations. \n\nMy girls are both in college now and are appalled by the number of students in their classes who simply don\u2019t turn in work or can not follow simple directions. But it begins in middle & high school. My niece and nephew are still in high school, and they are allowed to turn in all assignments for full credit through the end of the semester and can retake tests (and they attend the top rated public school in our large city.) Some kids will still succeed, but others are being set up for failure with this system.", "ESH - I understand your point, and if it were 1 kid I would understand, but if a bunch of kids in your class are failing, I think that's partially on you.  Your job is to teach them, not just hand out assignments.  They failed their assignments, and you failed to be an effective teacher.  I think you could have done more to explain the consequences and get them more engaged.\n\nUpdate: as far as the whole \"preparing them for the real world approach\", if one of the managers on my team had a bunch of people reporting to them who didn't get their work done, I'd be more concerned about the effectiveness of the manager to motivate them and give them clear direction.", "I'm going to go with an unpopular ESH.\n\n\\- the kids, obvious AH\n\n\\- parents, obvious AH\n\n\\- teacher, you don't need to do the work for them but perhaps give them a timeline of where you feel that should be at certain points or give them a countdown until due date.

A few years ago, a classroom teacher actually contacted me to let me know my daughter had to be asked several times to put hers away. (She would comply, but then bring it back out later within same class period).\n\nWith 50% of the class failing, it does sound like you have a problem with discipline and classroom management. Is this an issue school- wide?", "My only issue is with you not redirecting the kids wasting time in class. That\u2019s literally part of your job (I am also a Secondary teacher).

It'll help you focus your time better\n\nPersonally, I got extremely lucky in the sense that school was easy for me for a very long time.

It's not an ideal setup, but babying them about things they've had plenty of prior warning about right up till they're 18 will only make it worse.", "NTA", "ESH.  The students and parents for the obvious, but you as well, as it IS your job to employ classroom management.  That includes redirecting and implementing consequences in real time if those redirects need repeating.", "NTA - the parents are the AHs for letting their kids get away with that, then having the audacity to complain.", "NTA. I have a freshman and in this scenario I would think you absolutely right to fail him for making bad choices. Schools aren\u2019t preparing children for the real world by not giving them consequences for their choices.", "NTA give them a 10% for a participation trophy. That is what America has become. Just because a student attends class everyday, does not mean they should get a passing grade. In life there are winners, losers, and those that tried but didn't place first. Classes are not worthy of a participation grade, you have to do the work.", "NTA - You provided them with ample time and offered assistance. This is a lesson they need to learn. I am an elementary school teacher and am trying hard to get my young students to learn time management. I also tutor a middle schooler who missed the honor roll last semester because he didn\u2019t turn in an assignment. His parents didn\u2019t complain to the teacher. Now he regularly contacts me to come help him get a head start on his projects well before they are due because he learned the importance of being organized and prepared. (He is not \u201cschool\u201d person, but now recognizes he will do better work and get better grades if he doesn\u2019t waste class time and gets ahead on assignments). I hope your students can learn the sam lesson.", "NTA. I give my college students six weeks in class and half a semester outside to do a final project and I\u2019ve still had to fail some who just didn\u2019t do it. You\u2019re their teacher, not their babysitter, and it\u2019s not your job to coddle them because they couldn\u2019t be bothered to do the work.", "NTA definitely. I have grandsons 11 and 14 years old, both in middle school. They check their youngest son\u2019s school page and look in his take home folder every day. They help him keep track of assignments and progress on projects. He does his homework in the kitchen. \n\nGuess what?  After being treated the same way the 14 year-old does his homework in his room without being asked. He keeps track of his own progress, and asks for help when he needs it. Exactly what you would expect from a child that age. If he drops the ball, he knows he will suffer the consequences. Mom and dad only intervene on their behalf if they feel there\u2019s been some misunderstanding, or if they think there is truly a problem (that rarely happens).", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it is amazing how the parents have the guts to be upset after you explained not only to the students, but to them directly what this project would mean for their grade. When I was in school, the teachers would only explain to the students what projects, tests and other activities are graded and how. Parents had to check with their children or personally come to school to ask the teacher about the curriculum. And 2 hours plus a week is plenty of time for any project at that level. If they aren't capable at 14-15 to prioritize their school work, I think their parents did a lousy job educating them.", "NTA. They had class time and several days on their own. I'm in college as well as teaching part time. My professors routinely give assignments that we have zero class time on and are due on the weekends or during the holidays. I had 3 assignments due during Thanksgiving week and another 4 due in the middle of next week. I have all the materials needed available on Blackboard and in my books, I just have to prioritize doing the work in my own time. \n\nYour job as a high school teacher is to prepare them for college work or working a job, both things demand that a person be able to work on their own without direct supervision. Better to fail and learn that lesson now instead of when it costs thousands of dollars to retake a class or they get fired because they can't fulfill their job responsibilities without someone breathing down their neck.", "NTA. You made it very clear to the kids AND their parents (not something that any teachers of mine ever did when I was in high school) that late work would not be accepted in this case. Yeah I guess post panini it\u2019s much harder to get them to be on task, but they are still 14/15, you shouldn\u2019t need to hold their hands at this point. The only thing I would say here is that hopefully you\u2019re within the school/ district policies here, because you may be told you have to accept late work, or that you are supposed to be trying to keep them on task. It\u2019s frustrating, absolutely. Especially when it happens all the time or it\u2019s the same kid/ group of kids every time. Maybe take a little time next lesson to let them know about the importance of staying on task, because in college their professors won\u2019t hold their hands, if they go into the workforce, their bosses won\u2019t hold their hands. At some point they\u2019re got to start acting responsibly.", "You didn't fail the kids.  They and their parents failed.  NTA", "NTA. As a college professor, I thank you. They come to my classes and think they should be given the same leeway they were given in high school. Yes, they are children in your class, but children need to learn so they can become functional adults. Thank you for holding firm.", "ESH you the least but why ARE you letting students be on their phone watching movies in class?", "NTA. The students need to listen and do the work.", "Info: do any of the students have IEPs? If so, were their IEPs followed? \n\nI am coming at this as a parent of a seventh grader who has an IEP and among his many issues is a severe deficit in executive function. If you give him 2 hours in class unstructured he\u2019s absolutely going to FA. We are working on that, but honestly I don\u2019t see him being able to complete an assignment on something he is not interested in 2 years from now if it\u2019s handed to him without further support. My kid is actually really really off the charts smart- but he\u2019s a hot mess on organizing. \n\nI\u2019m giving a NTA judgement here but I just wanted to mention the whole IEP thing and hope you\u2019ll definitely consider that with kids in your class who may really need some extra support.", "this is gonna get downvoted but... YTA. your job is to teach, not sit there and expect your students to be fully self-motivated and not direct them whatsoever during their class time. the fact of the matter is that you ALLOWED them to goof off during class time instead of working on their project, then seemed to get some sort of smug self-satisfaction about it when they ended up failing because you... let them. what were you doing during those two full in-class hours, anyway?", "Teachers are paid to teach. Not parent. And this is parenting, not teaching.", "That's what is wrong with students today, they don't put in the work.", "NTA. My, my, my. It\u2019s the consequences of their actions coming back to haunt them.", "NTA Honestly, they\u2019re learning a more valuable lesson here than the project itself.", "Gawd I feel so sorry for teachers nowadays.", "Absolutely. \n\n**Natural consequences are SO important for kids at this age! School is socialization, and an essential part of socialization is learning how your action (and inaction) impacts your success.**\n\nWhat I have seen in the last ten or so years of teaching is a combination of learned helplessness, hand-holding, and pandering to parents. Students receive *arbitrary* consequences, like having their phone taken away, or receiving detention, for actions like not paying attention in class, or skipping class. How on EARTH does this translate to the real world? Your boss won\u2019t assign you twenty minutes at lunch to sit and stare at the wall because you were late to work. It will just damage your reputation at work and put your job at risk.\n\n**So much of the intervention that happens at schools currently is to PREVENT natural consequences (losing the credit) from occurring.** Essentially, prevent them from learning to take responsibility for their actions. Take their phone away so they can whine and complain but will have no choice but to do their work. Allow them to have endless chances and extensions when they don\u2019t do what is required to achieve the desired result, so that the school\u2019s / province\u2019s graduation numbers are massively inflated and so that parents don\u2019t have a reason to be upset.\n\nWhat do kids learn from this? That obstacles will be removed from their path, that they deserve endless patience, that they are entitled to special treatment, that their actions do not actually have consequences? Or worse\u2026 that they actually aren\u2019t (in their minds) capable of doing hard things without support?\n\nWhat do kids get out of this? A degree that would allow them to enrol in expensive post-secondary education that they don\u2019t have the skills or self-regulation or self-efficacy to be successful in?  I know so many students who honestly would have been better off dropping out, getting some hands-on work experience that they crave, having a few hard knocks, realizing the value of education, and getting their GED.  Or even just better off failing a course or two early in their high school career, realizing that success means actually applying yourself, and making appropriate adjustments to their work habits to be successful.", "NTA. You were behaving exactly like an adult is supposed to behave. I feel sorry for the children of parents,", "Probably during his regular class time, if time is given to work on their project, there will be  those students who will goof around instead.", "I had undiagnosed ADHD until I was nearly 25, and back in high school, I was a weird mix of you and these kids. Sometimes I would put in 200% effort and finish a week in advance, sometimes I\u2019d procrastinate until the night before and then pull an all-nighter, and sometimes, I begged my teachers for an extension instead. Kept doing this in uni too. And 100% agree with your NTA.\n\nHonestly, if teachers had been harder on me, it\u2019s very possible someone could\u2019ve picked up my ADHD much sooner and present me would\u2019ve loved that. \ud83e\udd72", "I agree although I'm interested in knowing the overall atmosphere/ dynamics of this school. I have two teens in high school right now. This would not happen there. The teachers have control of the classrooms and will call out any individual who is screwing around. They will contact parents if it's a repeat issue. \n\nI can see where that might be more difficult, though, if it's half the class and they don't have the discipline already established.", "My kids' high school gives them a ton of projects. There are usually project \"checkpoints\" with grades posted, so everyone (parents, kids) can see that zero on Checkpoint 1 online. It wound be rare to completely blow off an entire project, because there would have been 3-5 checkpoints posted, and most likely those parents who get outraged about grades wood have stepped in by that point.", "Also just wanted to say- if I were a parent and you looped me in via a communication that did not come home via my child (ie direct email) I would not be upset with you if my kid failed. Because you gave me a heads up, we would be working on it at home regardless I\u2019d what he did in class. If we didn\u2019t work on it at home and I knew about it, that\u2019s on me.", "It\u2019s cute that people are downvoting my IEP comment. Hope all of you never have a child with extra needs.", "The also had a week at home as well not only the time in class by your logic the parents have just as much blame.", "Yeah!!! Back in my day students walked 5 miles up the hill in the snow to school. And when they would run out of ink and led, they would write with their blood. /s", "That will depend on power of the parents and the school administrators.", "To be fair, I could never, ever focus in class as effectively as I could focus at home, so I'd definitely be one of those kids that looked like I did nothing in class.\n\nThat said, I did always get my shit done at home and turn my work in on time, and if I didn't, my parents never would've emailed the teacher - they'd know it was my fault.", "Oh good! You have documentation! I taught for over 10 years and documentation is EVERYTHING. It's great to know you're sticking to your decision. NTA, 100%!", "That will depend on power of the parents and the school administrators. Some are better than others for having the teachers\u2019 back.", "Not everyone who says something about millennials are boomers. I\u2019m way to young to be a boomer.", "Because it was the kids fault that they couldn't take some time to do the project.", "Uphill, both directions!", "Directions unclear, sitting here with a bucket of blood and am getting weird looks. Instructions please?", "\ud83e\udd23", "True but then i suppose he can fight it? In my country he can at least", "Without shoes.", "You\u2019re joking but I walk to school 40 minutes each direction every day, both ways is uphill somehow, and there are no buses that make the way shorter despite the fact that I live in a large city."]}
