This week before Thanksgiving I gave a final project on a unit. I explained the directions and gave them several choices for how they wanted to present the material. I also informed them this would be a test grade and that since the material would not be used going forward they could not turn it in after the deadline. I let their parents know as well. During the period I made sure to tell students I was available with any questions they had about the project and answered and gave examples for those who asked. However, a bunch of students chose not to use their time effectively and played on their phones, watched movies or played games on their computers. These are the same students who have done this all year. At this point I decided not to intervene and to simply let them waste their own time and fail. When the missing project caused a lot of them drop to a failing grade I got many angry emails from parents. I explained that they had two full hours to complete the project in class and an additional week at home. I explained the consequences of not turning the project in to the students AND parents and still this occurred and that class time should\u2019ve been more effectively used instead of doing other things. I got berated for not \u201cbeing an adult\u201d and putting my foot down with the kids and letting them be off task.

You were beyond fair and even went as far to tell the parents about the project. These teens need to learn actions have consequences. Better they learn before they turn 18 and realize jobs and college classes will not be forgiving of ignoring actual work either.", "NTA\n\nThis is a 100% literal FAFO \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAt 14 and 15 they need to learn that they can't do this and expect to pass. Also that parents can't get them out of trouble.", "NTA. You gave them plenty of time and notice. Every action has a consequence, and kids need to learn that. Also they had home time, so why weren\u2019t the parents monitoring that their kids were getting the project done? They had more time there than at school.", "NTA\n\nFormer teacher here.\n\nThey need to learn a life lesson and mom/dad aren\u2019t going to save them if they don\u2019t want to try.", "I'm a teacher and there is no point in asking if you are an asshole. Someone will always critique choices you make. If you reminded the students more frequently they would have acted as if you were nagging them.", "NTA. You are a teacher, not a parent. *They* needed to put their foot down and parent their children, especially since you went out of your way to let them know.\n\nAt 14/15 these kids should be learning to self-motivate and time manage. You laid out your expectations and the consequences. Anything that follows is their own fault.", "If what you\u2019re saying is all true I would say you\u2019re not the asshole. Parents now a days are so annoying but just automatically siding with their \u201cperfect little Angels\u201d and never putting their foot down and be actual parents. Good job fail those shits.", "NTA at all. Perhaps this will be a good lesson for them. I kinda doubt it, but one can hope. I can't believe parents these days. Never ever have I had a beef with a teacher over *my kid* not turning in their school work. And we wonder why people don't want to take up teaching as much anymore. I couldn't do your job, so hats off.", "NTA your a teacher not babysitter. But you won't win, your job will be at risk. A gang of parents can talk bad about you and get you fired. That's what is wrong with students today, they don't put in the work. And parents don't care enough to make them work.", "NTA, you told them what they needed to do You gave them opportunities to do it during your class, you told the parents about the assignment. There's really nothing else you could have done. They are at the age where they can start learning about the real world consequences of their actions. One part that bugs me is that people were on their phones and watching movies on their computers, but I'm assuming this was like a study period and not your actual class?", "NTA obviously... get your documentation ready for when administrators get involved.", "NTA, life has consequences. Those students failed themselves most of all", "NTA Honestly, they\u2019re learning a more valuable lesson here than the project itself.  Actions (or inactions) have consequences. If the parents are coming at you trying to fix their kid\u2019s screw ups, they\u2019re obviously not appreciating that, and likely not teaching it themselves.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t like the \u201cno credit for late work\u201d policy some teachers have, but it was explained to everyone ahead of time, so no fault to OP here. \n\nQuestion, are you going to allow them to do something for extra credit later on?", "NTA. You were behaving exactly like an adult is supposed to behave. I feel sorry for the children of parents, who are unable and unwilling to have their offspring comply to normal rules. Whatever is going to become of them? Hopefully some of them learn from experiences in school, but some will never learn.", "NTa. It\u2019s a good lesson more kids and adults need to learn, actions have consequences.", "I hate to say an Eagles fan isn't an ahole, but here we go, NTA.", "NTA. At that age they are more than capable of making an informed decision regarding time management. \n\nThey chose to play games instead. This speaks more of their home life than of you as it's been consistent.", "So you're the bad guy for letting them do what they've always done for that particular hour but the parents are not responsible for the week at home portion? Or the rest of the year? Interesting logic.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You already know this.  \nGood job on involving parents.  They want to control your classroom but can\u2019t seem to handle the home portion of parenting. It\u2019s easier to simply hand their kids a device than it is to be involved in their lives or learning. Good work, teach; keep it up.\nEdit for spelling.", "NTA. My, my, my. It\u2019s the consequences of their actions coming back to haunt them. How very life-like. \nMaybe the parents should have done their responsibility and made sure their precious brats did their homework at home?", "NTA. They're old enough to understand their actions have consequences.", "NTA. They've got to learn to use their time wisely.", "NTA.Part of your job is to teach responsibility and meeting deadlines.  It is an important lesson for high school students to learn to manage their time and take deadlines seriously.  Projects are important since more and more jobs will be project based assignments.   Those parents are enabling their child's failures and aren't parenting their children.  Parents and students need to learn there are consequences for ones behavior.", "NTA.\nGood on you\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Of course you\u2019re NTA.", "Nta.

They were playing games and watching movies on their computer during class time? If so I don\u2019t think you have particularly good control of your class room. These are 14-15 year olds they need to start taking some responsibility for their work but your a teacher and it doesn\u2019t show you in a particularly good light if you didn\u2019t at least make them stop playing games ect in class time.", "ESH yes, you\u2019re teaching them an important life lesson. But your job is to teach you should have set things up in your classroom so they learn in a graduated way that failure has a price. In other words have something that would not cause a failing grade, but they would still fail if they were not doing it and then later on in the semester, do what you just talked about above, that way they know when advance the price of failure is higher and they also learned", "ESH them because they were lazy and didn\u2019t do the work. You and this is the only reason for the ESH verdict because you allowed them not to work while they were in the room. We can\u2019t judge parents and say they didn\u2019t do their part and you didn\u2019t completely do yours. Had you made them work I\u2019d have your back. I\u2019m a veteran teacher myself and have had to give failing test grades out for projects before but that\u2019s only after repeated in class reminders, multiple reminder notes home and a couple of classes detailing the project and having them actively work on it. If they still can\u2019t get it done then that on them. And I\u2019d like to add that even with all that make sure you\u2019re willing to listen to some kids one on one about why it isn\u2019t done  just because there\u2019s always one kid with a legitimate reason why it\u2019s not done. ( I\u2019ve had students who go home and have to help their family with work just so those family\u2019s can get by. Situations are not always black and white. But for those who are just lazy give them a zero and move on.", "NTA.", "Is a teacher really asking Reddit how to do their job? Wouldn't it be more effective to ask your colleagues or so school administration if your rules are fair?", "NTA. \n\nThere are also a lot of millennial parents nowadays. Many millennials grew up thinking everyone should win and get an award regardless of their achievements. Everyone wins and no one looses. They received awards for just showing up regardless of effort. Nope. Not in your class. \n\nAlso, if you want to be nice, you can give out an extra credit project to the entire class. Give them an opportunity to bring up their grade. Make it extra work that will take an entire weekend. Then sees who do it.", "NTA for failing them but in all honesty kids are dumb and I agree they need to learn to take school seriously. There could be options like letting them turn it in late for half points, or adding more to the project (i.e. waste more of their time). \n\nI had teachers who refused to budge at all and they were viewed as being AHs because of it. They're still kids and should get a 2nd chance as they're still learning how their decisions can screw their lives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They need to learn responsibility. You gave them clear instructions and told them everything they needed to know. If they choose to throw away their time and not do their assignment, that's on them. I can understand putting your foot down for maybe elementary schoolers but high schoolers are old enough to know the consequences of their actions.", "As a parent myself who watched her daughter fail class projects.. NTA. They didn\u2019t put in the work.", "NTA. Those Fs were well-deserved.", "So. You get a trophy.  Everybody gets a trophy.  These parents are jerks.  NTA.  Definitely.", "NTA you let the parents know their children had homework to do and they should have done it.", "NTA. Eff those parents and those kids.", "NTA - let the kids learn. Learning doesn't happen if the outcome is magically removed.", "NTA.  You laid out the roadmap for them to follow and they chose to ignore you, sometimes the best teacher can be Failure.", "NTA! \nWhen I was in school I was a straight A student despite my ADHD. I would work so hard and be stressed out a lot, but I got my shit done. Then I'd go into class and find that since so many other kids didn't do the work and would fail the teacher caved and either extended time or made the project simpler. It drove me crazy, like my hard work didn't matter in the end. I can think of this happening even once when I was in college. I know it's partially because the school system is set up in a way the a bunch of failing students actually impact the teacher's performance more than their own, but still it would piss me off.", "NTA.  If they don't want to be bothered with the assignment, they can deal with the consequences.  No work, no grade.  I don't know what's so hard to understand about that.", "NTA\n\n\nFinally a teacher who has balls.\nI wish they would do this at my kids school.\nYou told everyone so the ones who didn't find there kids important enough to help them are AH.", "NTA at all", "NTA. I have a 14 year old. If she pulled this shit, I'd be telling her that this is the consequence of not getting her work done.", "Nope, you did your job.  They all just learned a very valuable lesson, and all of the kids you failed just educated the rest of the school that you're a tough teacher.", "NTA - I like the term \"Fucked around and found out\"  which is exactly what the kids did. Stay firm in your decision you are NTA. Too many kids always get a pass in school. I watch kids with end of year scores of F just get pushed to the next grade. It was always bizarre.", "NTA. But you know parents.  They don't care about reason and logic.  And many won't do what they need to do to get their kids in line.  The reality of today is many administrators don't want the hassle of holding the line.  Parents just want the grades, and so do kids. The only ones that are holding people accountable are the teachers.  So expect no matter how many warnings you give, that when the parent comes in to have your head, that they will say you should have given one more.\n\nYou not only have to be in the right, you have to get them to commit to what they would accept as you doing enough to justify the bad grade.  And then show them the extra evidence that proves it. \n\nI have a friend who caught a kid cheating by having his phone in his lap during a test.  His word that the kid was using his phone wasn't enough.  He had to wait until the parent came in and get them to admit that if he actually had a picture that this kid was using his phone then they would agree to a zero.  And then he showed them the picture he took from the back of the room showing the kid doing exactly what he said.  They were soooo pissed.  I am surprised that they didn't say he was just checking his horoscope during the test and try to get him off that way.", "I would say NTA, however, kids should not be allowed to use their phones in class.  Yes they have to learn to control their usage, but for some it is overwhelming.\nIf they couldn\u2019t use phones and still screwed around, yes fail them.  But I think it\u2019s your job to remove that oh so seductive distraction.", "You gave them class time and homework time, made the deadline and conditions clear to both the students and parents AND offered opportunities for them to get help, so NTA. \nTeachers have too much put on them as it is. Coddling 14-15 year olds isn't something you should have to take on as well. My child (14) recently missed a deadline like this, despite my efforts (so much effort lol). I made him complete and submit it anyway and emailed the teacher that we would be grateful for any feedback but absolutely understood that the assignment wouldn't count and that any feedback was 100% up to him, not a demand. \nMy opinions on the school system and teaching methods are a moot point unless I choose to spend my time and energy to contribute to solutions. In adult life you will have to deal with inflexible situations that you may not agree with, so it is a lesson they need to learn. Failing as assignment is a significant consequence, but not as big as ones they could face in later life.", "NTA. You are trying to teach them to become responsible and successful. You were clear about the expectations. \n\nMy girls are both in college now and are appalled by the number of students in their classes who simply don\u2019t turn in work or can not follow simple directions. But it begins in middle & high school. My niece and nephew are still in high school, and they are allowed to turn in all assignments for full credit through the end of the semester and can retake tests (and they attend the top rated public school in our large city.) Some kids will still succeed, but others are being set up for failure with this system.", "ESH - I understand your point, and if it were 1 kid I would understand, but if a bunch of kids in your class are failing, I think that's partially on you.  Your job is to teach them, not just hand out assignments.  They failed their assignments, and you failed to be an effective teacher.  I think you could have done more to explain the consequences and get them more engaged.\n\nUpdate: as far as the whole \"preparing them for the real world approach\", if one of the managers on my team had a bunch of people reporting to them who didn't get their work done, I'd be more concerned about the effectiveness of the manager to motivate them and give them clear direction.", "I'm going to go with an unpopular ESH.\n\n\\- the kids, obvious AH\n\n\\- parents, obvious AH\n\n\\- teacher, you don't need to do the work for them but perhaps give them a timeline of where you feel that should be at certain points or give them a countdown until due date.

If it was the former then I\u2019m leaning toward Y T A because you should be setting the tone for appropriate classroom behavior.
