Since I'm finishing up my masters degree right now, I know I'll have way too much free time given that I no longer will be in school or have a significant other for the foreseeable future. But, the ultimate fuck you for my ex would be to double up my money and show her what she fumbled. \n\nI work from home for a tech company. I do well financially, I only work realistically 5-10 hours per week and I'm paid for full time hours. I'm interviewing for another tech job right now and I'm hoping I land it so I can just do both full time.\n\nI was talking to one of my buddies over the weekend. He manages a local company and does all of the hiring for them. He mentioned that if I don't land this second job, he's got another remote tech job that he doesn't feel like interviewing/hiring for, and I could have it if I wanted it. \n\nMy parents have been gone for a couple months doing some travelling. I called them to tell them about how the interview process was going and that I think I have a good shot at landing the job. I also told them about how I have a backup plan for a second job. She instantly dismissed everything I said and immediately mentioned \"your brother would want that second job\". \n\nI'm struggling to see if I'm being greedy by wanting the second job, even though I've been interviewing/applying to jobs for a couple months now. \n\nNote - He's the baby of the family. When I was in my undergrad & working, he was an alcoholic/addict. Anything that needed to be done (regardless of what I had on my plate) was expected of me, and never asked of him. When they left for their 2 month vacation, my mom asked me to make sure I cooked for him, clean the house and do all of the general maintenance that homeownership involves. They even paid for his entire undergrad, while I graduated with 25k debt. Mind you, mine was slightly more expensive, but the principle of it still bothers me. \n\nObviously I want to see my brother succeed, but I'm torn about this whole debacle. AITA for taking the job that's being handed out IF the one I'm interviewing for doesn't work out?\n\nSince it\u2019s been asked a few times - my brother and I are best friends to this day, despite all of the extra stuff that\u2019s been added to my plate over the years from his mistakes & laziness", "created_utc": 1691529636, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lut5a/aita_my_mom_thinks_i_shouldnt_accept_job_offer/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend offered the job to YOU because he knows your character, your intellect, your work ethic, and felt based on those he could offer YOU the job without an interview.  No guarantee he feels the same about your brother.  \n\nAnd if your brother is not the same caliber as you in professional terms, recommending him for the job could burn you a bridge and lose you a friendship if it goes south.  You never know when you might want that again.  Maybe you take the first job, it sucks, and you want out after a few months.  You keep your friend around, you might have an easy out.  You recommend your brother, you might be stuck and down a professional contact who could have really come in handy.\n\nJob offers are not transferrable.  They apply only to the person they were offered to.  YOU were offered the job, not your brother.  You can't just pass it along, and it would be professionally foolish to try unless you think your brother would truly be a good fit.", "NTA.\n\nIf you've been offered a job by someone and don't take it, you *can't* just hand the offer to someone else.

Your brother needs to learn to fend for himself and your parents need to stop enabling him. You are under no obligation to find him a job, or to give him yours. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. His being unemployed is not your responsibility.", "That\u2019s\u2026. not how jobs work. You can\u2019t just give a job offer to someone else. NTA.", "NTA.  \nThat's a toxic family you got there. Stay away, live the life YOU want for YOURSELF, and get (if you don't already have one) a healthy friends circle. Friends are the family you choose after all.  \nGet that job. It's lined up with YOUR name on it, not your brother's. Your mother's opinion and favoritism have no value here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat a ridiculous idea. Don't give up your job for your brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Joboffers simply don't work that way.", "Yeah, NTA. That job offer was offered to you and not to your brother. Also, as someone has already asked, is your brother even capable of doing it? Then we get to the matter of your brother being 25 years old. He is perfectly capable of looking for his own jobs. Tell your family no and go LC/NC with them if you have to. There's only one golden child here and it's not you.", "NTA what they're asking if you is ridiculous.  First of all you shouldn't be guilty into turning down a job you want. Work takes up a massive portion of our waking hours so if you have the opportunity to work somewhere you think will be fulfilling then don't pass it up. \nSecondly, that id simply not how job offers work! \"Thanks for the offer but I'll have to turn it down, take this person youve never interviewed instead\" you'd be laughed out of the building.  \n\nAlso if your brother is in recovery I imagine it will do wonders tor his self esteem and sense of achievement to get himself a job on his own merits. \n\nTell your family that you'll take the job if you want it and that you have all the faith in the world that your brother can find something he's passionate himself.", "NTA\n\nFor one you're the one being offered the job. Not your brother. For two recommending your brother for the job places both your reputation, and your friendship on the line, and thirdly, you are not responsible for your brother. Period.\n\nIf your brother wants a job, he can do the work, and get one. If your mom wants him to get a job then she needs to make sure he does that. There is however no version of this story that makes it your responsibility to get him a job, or give him one that was offered to you.", "NTA and Hell No.  Mom is brazen to ask you to hand over a hard-won business opportunity that you've worked for, then again; they are  enthusiastic to coddle him within a dysfunctional co-dependence so the 'ask' is not a surprise. They easily throw 10k's++his way to ensure he achieves. \n\nYou earned the 2nd job with talent and tenacity. I'm blown away they cannot see they hold drastically different expectations between a 26 and 25 year old son. Reading this is tiring and it reeks of BS you've had to endure for years.\n\nPerhaps mom wants an easy answer for son #2 while, once again, not acknowledging or congratulating you on you achievements...(and here's the kicker)...**.that you created**. Your brother needs to create something on his own.  Don't cave to this request plus your reputation is on the line should you 'get him' a job.  Best to you in all that you pursue.", "NTA families members working for friends is not usually a good idea and that fact is compounded by his issues. Why doesn't mom apply for jobs for him?", "You're not best friends. You're his, but he's not yours. Look at the bigger picture. It seems that what is needed is for you to take  a step back and keep all of them at a distance. NTA", "NTA that\u2019s not how job offers work. She\u2019s delusional. What are you supposed to call them up and say, \u201cyou know what? Don\u2019t hire me, hire my unqualified brother instead\u201d that\u2019s a joke.", "Dear OP you earned that job through your own effort so NTA to you. You would be an AH to yourself if you decline the job offer and give it to your unemployed brother. You get that job offer and start with the new company.\n\nMy advice to you is do not listen to your mum. Don't let your brother take the job offer from you when he did not go for the interview himself. Don't let mum guilt you into thinking you are some greedy ambitious person who only thinks for himself. Your mum is being naive to think a job offer can be easily handed down to your unemployed brother. I am sorry that your mum did not tell you how proud she is of you which shows she favours her other son over you\n\nAsk yourself these questions. If you let your unemployed brother take your job offer, do you think he will be as conscientious and hardworking as you? Do you think he will be punctual and able to complete those projects well if given the chance? If your brother shows he has a bad work ethic in that role you are meant to take up he will be embarassing both himself and you\n\nYou got this job offer fair and square so don't decline it. Be proud of yourself", "Hate to burst mommy and daddy's bubble, but there's no \"giving it to your unemployed brother\".  I realize job hunting sucks; I spent a whole year after college unemployed, unable to collect unemployment from temporary summer jobs (1 year on the job minimum), disability (Asperger's doesn't count apparently, but an invisible back injury/pain does?), nothing.  No one helped me beyond sending me postings for a job I'm likely eligible for.  No one vouched for me, stuck their neck out for me, or leveraged networking connections to help, not even family or friends.  It sucks, but guess what?  Tough.  That's the job market for you, and it's never kind if you're applying while unemployed, especially entry level.  \n\nEven if you did want to \"give\" your brother your job, it's not going to happen:  Employers like someone that shows initiative, that meets qualifications, that does things themselves.  Your brother clearly doesn't fit the bill.  If he wants to get one himself, he can start by applying by himself, asking said person for a job, doing his resume, CV, whatever, and turn it in (if he even qualifies).  If he can't even clean up after himself or cook meals for himself, he sounds absolutely helpless.  That's not your problem.  Must be nice that mommy and daddy picked up the tab for his schooling; I'd kill for such generous parents.\n\nThat all being said, NTA.  You want him to succeed, tell him to send his resume in to your friend and see if he fits the bill.  If he rejects your brother, it isn't your fault at all.  Take the second job though if you get it; a lot of good jobs get filled the way you're going.", "NTA The job was offered to you not your brother. Your Mom has some messed up\nThinking.", "NTA.  He can find his own damn job.", "Uhhh\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t take the job if offered, they\u2019ll go with the next one in line not offer it to your brother\n\n\nIs she implying your brother pretend to be you or something?\n\n\nNTA for getting a 2nd job except to job #1", "INFO:  Is your brother qualified for the job?

That's not how huring works.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to give", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to give", "If you \"give\" that job to your brother, you'll be \"helping him out every once in a while\" ALL the time.", "NTA", "What are the odds that if your brother did get the job with your friend, that you would be doing all of \\*his\\* work as well as your own?\n\nMom: \"Just finish off this project for your brother, you wouldn't want him to become unemployed.\"\n\nSorry, but if brother is so incompetent that he can't do basic self-care e.g. cooking, cleaning the house, then he's not employable. Do not recommend him, you will endanger your friendship.", "Exactly.\n\nDoes the brother even have qualifications?", "Neither can the brother.  Job offers can't just get transferred like that.  It's not how any of this works.", "Also, job offers don't work like this.\n\nIf I was the employer and OP tried to pass the job offer onto someone else, I wouldn't hire either of them.", "Nope. His degree is political science, mine is data science.", "To be honest, I think my mom is overcompensating now because I was always the golden child. Good grades, multi-sport athlete and everything came easy to me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I got into post secondary that she really started coddling him and putting more on me.", "Well, I\u2019m trying my second one now. If I can manage just those two, $160k + bonuses is more than enough for me. I guess I could probably manage three though, that\u2019s what my buddy who offered me the fallback job does.", "Does your mother not realize that or is it the kind of job that anyone can do? Either way, your mother is a trip. Your brother needs to figure out his own shit or forever be lazy. I think being coddled is a special kind of disease given only to the baby in the family. I got one myself.", "They can switch roles too, it\u2019s not uncommon and it\u2019s still toxic", "NTA\n\nDo you really want to screw things up with your friend? Then recommend that your alcoholic / addict unemployed brother who I guess still lives at home should have the job.\n\n*You* someone would employ. Your brother --- not so much.", "NTA, but is he even qualified for it?", "NTA\n\nA parent shouldn\u2019t tell one child to give up an opportunity for their sibling, even as adults.\n\nYour mother is engaging in favoritism and infantalizing your brother. Asking you to keep an eye on him/be there if he needs a little extra support to avoid relasing?\n\nGreat.\n\nTaking on his adult responsibilities *like cooking and cleaning for him*???\n\nAbsolutely not.", "No no no. And move out. No more taking care of a grown ass man!", "NTA.. reccomending him for the job could backfire. But you know the situation best. There may be other ways to help him out, it sounds like you want to help get him launched....", "NTA. Evenif you pass up a job offer, that doesn't mean he would get it.", "NTA. Your brother didn't interview and he might not even be qualified for the job.  It's one thing to suggest that your brother applies to a job but it's on him to get the interview and land the job. This is ridiculous.  If I interviewed somebody and they told me that sorry but I should hire their sibling for the job, I definitely would not hire either of them", "NTA and you\u2019d be a fool to pass the job to your brother. If he messes up it reflects poorly on you. And this isn\u2019t me dogging him. Just this week a friend told me they were looking for someone and if I knew I\u2019d anybody, and I do, but the other friend who wants a job is not reliable. I won\u2019t put my name on the line for someone who won\u2019t be able to fulfill the responsibilities. \n\nAnd a side note? You sound badass. I\u2019m sure your brother is your best friend for good reasons. Yet he won\u2019t do much for himself at this rate. You might want to consider pulling back when you can since your parents set the tone for enabling him.", "NTA, but you can't seriously call someone who makes you do everything for them your best friend. Listen, you have worth, go get some friends.", "NTA\n\nJob offers generally are not transferable", "The job was not offered to your brother. NTA", "NTA. The job was offered to YOU, not a lazy loser who may not even have the basic qualifications. If your brother wants a job, he can get off his ass and start looking for one.", "NTA It was offered to you, not your brother. Rather absurd they think you can just give him your job.", "NTA Because your buddy offered you the position--he didn't offer bro. If, **if** theoretically it was an open position for whoever wanted it you could feel conflicted, but that isn't the scenario.", "NTA. Jon offers are not transferable. Your friend probably has a second choice in his mind if he's taken applications for the job from the people who've already applied. You can't just say \"you want to hire me? Cool, hire my brother instead,\" like its an ice cream cone you don't want, your friend will just go with his second choice.", "[removed]", "You're 26. You've got plenty of time.\n\nAnd I'll bet you learned a lot from your relationship.", "You're really bitter about this breakup.

Your brother can find his own employment. Don't enable him. Your mother is not helping him. If you interview for the job, get the job, and then your brother is the one who starts, you are committing fraud. Live an ethical life and you'll have no regrets. If your brother starts pretending to be you, you're in for a rough ride. Don't do it.", "NTA.  \n\nJob offers aren't really transferable, and your brother is more than old enough to do his own job hunting.\n\nIf your mother doesn't think he should do any of the work, then she is agreeing to support him indefinitely, and that is her choice.", "NTA. It's up to your brother to find his own job", "I just qualified for the olympic but my mom said I should give my spot to my brother.", "NTA. You can't just transfer a job offer to someone else. Imagine telling the hiring person/ HR, \"actually, I'm not interested, but my brother (who you've never met) will be accepting in my place\"?!", "NTA why on earth does your mom think he is qualified? and your friend would likely not offer that role to him it was offered to you.,", "NTA - the job haven\u2019t been offered to your brother. You skipped the interview process by the fact the one recruiting know you, your ability to do the job. You aren\u2019t being greedy for other proposal. \n\nQuite delusional from your parents to expect your brother to be extended the same confidence to be fitting the job offer without interview, to the point they have the audacity to think you have the ability to give him your spot. \n\nThe job was offered to you. Your brother is entirely an other person. You may recommend him if you decide to not take up the offer. However it doesn\u2019t means your brother will even get to be interviewed.

It also happens at the expense of loving and opportunities for the other siblings (anybody also please correct me if i missed something in the definition)"]}
