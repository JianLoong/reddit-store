She was married to Scott and had three children with him who are now 11, 12 and 14. Scott and my grandkids stayed part of the family and last year Scott remarried. His current wife is Beth. We all knew Beth for a few years prior to the wedding and she was always very friendly. Though at times she could be a little pushy. Scott would always handle that though. After they got married Beth's pushiness got worse and Scott appears to have lost control.\n\nBeth was upset when she dropped my grandkids off one day that we had not added photos of her to our house and commented as such. In our living room we have a display with photos of our kids and their weddings. She felt her and Scott's wedding should be there.\n\nShe was upset when my grandkids spent Mother's Day with us and our extended family and we did not include her. Scott wasn't invited either. Mother's Day is a difficult day for him due to a bad relationship with his own mother. But Beth said we should invite her too because she's part of the family and then she said she's one of our kids too. I asked her what she meant and she told me she is obviously going to be one of our kids now that she's the mother figure for our grandkids. I told Scott what she said and he was embarrassed and told me he would speak to her.\n\nBeth was also upset when my husband posted on Facebook to say something about our kids and she didn't get mentioned as one of our kids, but as Scott's wife (we mentioned Scott and how wonderful he was to Abby and how wonderful he is as a father).\n\nFor my grandson's 14th birthday, we were all together and he wanted a \"mom's side\" photo. Beth attempted to get into the photo and when Scott tried to remind her she said she's part of the family now. He pulled her aside and the photo was taken without her. But she told one of my sons after that she felt like we weren't treating her as a daughter and then said Scott never treated her as a lesser wife.\n\nWe saw them a little over Christmas and Beth was upset that we got them a joint gift (for her and Scott) instead of getting her one alone. She told me she's tired of feeling like she's not really family and she said she feels like we always put Abby first when she's here now. I saw red after this and I told her she can never take my daughter's place and the fact she ever thought she could is outrageous. She told me the kids call her mom and they think the world of her so why wouldn't we. I told her the kids have always called her Beth when I hear them and she turned around and said that's our fault because the kids should be calling her mom and they don't. She lost it from there. Beth stormed out and I explained what happened to Scott. He apologized and left the kids with us so he could speak to her.\n\nI think they worked it out but Beth said I was needlessly cruel to imply she's not as good as Abby and doesn't deserve to be our daughter.

Beth sounds nuttier than squirrel shit.", "NTA: Beth has some issues she needs to work out. Insecurities about her place in the family. That doesn't mean you have to make her feel like a daughter. It's lovely you invite her to family events at all. Many grandparents would only take the children.\n\nScott needs to work with her on this. Mother's Day can be a special day for the two of them to be kid free (Honestly, many moms would die for a day off!) It sounds like he is trying though.", "NTA. I'm sorry, but does Beth think that because Scott was married to your daughter, and now he's married to her, that she is (by some ridiculous logic puzzle) your daughter now? That because her husband's kids are your family, that she is too?\n\nYou don't owe her *anything*. You are accepting because she's now family adjacent, and because arguing with her could affect your relationship with your grandkids. But she isn't your daughter, or your daughter-in-law.", "NTA - She is being far too much here.

You are not wrong. She needs to understand her position is SIL\u2019s wife, and maybe step mom. If the kids want to call her that, it has to be their choice. But 7yrs isn\u2019t so long that they don\u2019t remember their mother. And her trying to erase her memory to them is just too far. She needs to learn her place.", "Yikes. \n\nNTA\n\nScott needs to shut this down immediately.", "NTA \n\nScott needs to reevaluate who the hell he married.

Do you have any idea her relationship with her immediate family looks like?\n\nIf she has no relationship with her family, it sounds like she was hoping she could have a family by marrying scott but since it sounds like he has a bad relationship with his mother and he's close and a part of your family she thought maybe she could integrate with yours???", "NTA.\n\nThat is some Grade-A audacity on her part. My head just can't wrap around how she thinks she is so special that she xan replace your daughter.

She needs therapy badly!", "INFO: Are you absolutely, completely certain Beth knows that Scott is your son-in-law, not your son? It's hard to see how she could not know that, but the only other explanation I see here is that Beth is batshit.", "NTA.\n\nShe didn't get adopted by you because she married Scott. She isn't and never will be Abby. She isn't her replacement because she's here now. You weren't needlessly cruel, you was truthful and honest. She's expecting you to jump into loving her like a daughter like Abby never existed or mattered to you, the kids, or anyone else.\n\nI don't know what type of delulu Beth has convinced herself with, but this isn't going to work out like she thinks. Of course, the kids don't want to spend mothers Day with her. She isn't exactly being subtle about the boundaries she's willing to skip across with you, I suspect that it's the same at home, maybe worse.\n\nBeth needs a therapist.", "NTA; might want to double check she\u2019s not pressuring the kids when Scott\u2019s not around, too. She seems to be trying to erase Abby.", "NTA. you are not scott\u2019s parents. you are the grandparents of his children. beth is your grandchildren\u2019s stepmother, she is not really related. it\u2019s INCREDIBLY weird to me she is trying to push herself into a family she\u2019s not actually part of.", "NTA.  She isn't your daughter, she is your grandchildren's stepmother.  End of story.", "Given the children\u2019s ages and the potential to have a relationship with them that does not necessarily need facilitating by dad (eg guessing the oldest at least has their own phone)I would be starting to slowly phase out the parents even if this includes dialling down a relationship with their father, unless he is prepared to address the issues with his new wife.  Invite the kids over, offer to take the kids out for the day. Unhinged step mother not included.", "NTA.\n\nDoes Beth have her own family?", "NTA. Good Lord. First, I am very sorry for your loss. Second, this sounds weird and a bit troubling. Beth is acting like she married your son after his first wife passed and you\u2019re not accepting her. But Scott is your son-in-law so really Beth has no actual family relation to you outside the fact that she is your grandchildren\u2019s stepmother and your son-in-law\u2019s wife. Even so, you accepted her as much as anyone would-or could-reasonably expect you too. She needs to accept her role in the family as it is-or speak to a professional if she can\u2019t.", "NTA she sounds a bit unhinged. She married your son in law. That doesn\u2019t make her your daughter!", "I think that Beth has forgotten that you did not marry or adopted her and that you aren\u2019t her husband\u2019s bio mother. I think her expectations for this relationship is all over the place and she\u2019s acquainting acceptance from you with acceptance with her new family.", "NTA.  It's weird to expect a widower's in-laws to accept his new wife as their own daughter. If she wanted a Mother's Day celebration with her stepkids, then she should have worked that out with her husband instead of trying to crash your event.", "NTA- Beth needs some serious therapy because she is out of her mind. Scott needs to rethink the marriage because she is going to damage the kids with the way she\u2019s acting. Stepmother from hell.", "Ummmmm..... How old is she? WOW...... You're her husbands in-laws (and not her family0. Of course she's NOT family. NTA. But she's unhinged.", "Nta. Block her from seeing your social media's.\n\nTell Scott that you don't wish to cause difficulties for him but Beth is no longer welcome at your house/events. Her constant disrespect of your deceased daughter is not acceptable and its causing your family further grief and pain.The kids are old enough to maintain a relationship outside a caretaker so if Scott isn't able to drop them off kr bringvthem around arrange through him a neutral location or collect form school etc. For that yo change Beth need to attend therapy and understand that her expectations/demands are unreasonable and hurtful and stops.", "What in the Single White Female...\n\nNTA.\n\nBeth married your son-in-law, not your son. At best, she's your children's step-mother, but has zero relation to you because no matter how much you love ***HIM***, her marriage *to* him doesn't make *her* **YOUR** daughter-in-law.

This is so triggering\u2026..NTA, but you have to let the father know you don\u2019t want anything to do with HIS wife, WHO is not your daughter, what does she want ?? everyone forget the mother of the kids I\u2019m here now??? Sheesh!!", "My mom died when I was four years old. Everyone involved is dealing with a no-win situation the best they can. \n\nKudos to Beth for *wanting* and *trying* to be a family member.

You are already going way above and beyond with how kind you are to her now. She has to have some self awareness that her very presence would not be possible if not for the untimely death of YOUR child. She\u2019s not even your daughter in law. She\u2019s your daughter\u2019s widower\u2019s second wife. You owe her nothing more than the cordiality you afford a stranger.", "She needs a therapist.", "I\u2019m going to give an alternate way of thing of this. You have lost one of the most important people in your world and she will never be replaced in your hearts. You also have a woman that wants to make your grandchildren happy, and wants a relationship with you as well. Maybe she\u2019s coming in a little hot, but she\u2019s trying. Isn\u2019t that better than someone who tries to keep those kids away from you? \n\nSometimes family chooses you.  Don\u2019t turn them away because of your loss. What would your daughter want?", "NTA it's weird behaviour from her to keep pushing this image but why isn't Scott doing anything about it? It must be upsetting to your grandchildren to watch what's going on. It doesn't sound like a healthy family life at all", "NTA did she really expect you to put her first over your daughter because she married your SIL?", "NTA\n\nThis is so strange... why doesn't Beth bark up Scott's parent's tree?", "NTA - that lady has mental health issues and needs to go to therapy.", "NTA. She ISN'T your daughter; she is married to the father of your grandkids. I get where she is coming from but she is going at it all wrong. \n\nShe is probably upset that the kids don't call her Mom and other aspects of her life that make her realize that she will never truly be their mother.  She needs therapy.", "This can NOT be real. If it is, Beth is insane. That is scary behavior!", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve been perfectly nice to Beth as Scott\u2019s wife, but she isn\u2019t and can never be your daughter and she\u2019s way out of line. Maybe she feels insecure about her status as Scott\u2019s second wife, but damn.

For an adult to not understand that boggles me.", "NTA Beth is unhinged \u2026 she needs to accept her place of his wife , she is not your child", "NTA - Beth sounds delusional and crazy. Poor Scott.", "NTA - You have no relation to Scott other than him being the guy who was married to you deceased daughter. Beth has even less relation to you.\n\nShe isn't family to you, she's just the step-mother of the grandkids who don't even treat her as a mother.\n\nThis is Scott's problem to deal with and if he can't then I see nothing wrong with what you said.", "This kind of scenario is sadly common. Beth is jealous and resentful of your daughter. She's treating death similar to divorce, in that the new wife should supplant the former one. This rarely works out in cases of divorce, but most people don't understand that death is not a failure of a partnership, and that a stepparent can never take the place of the deceased no matter what they do or don't do. If a parent dies when a child is four years old or older, which is the case with your grandchildren, they have living memories of their mom that can not be taken away from them. They may never call Beth mom and that's not due to anything you have done.\n\nYou have maintained a close relationship with your son-in-law and grandchildren, and that makes Beth feel even more excluded. There is no path forward for her. \n\nI do think Beth's expectations are unreasonable and that you're in no way in the wrong. Having said that, if you can find it in your heart to reach out to her, she might benefit from a day walking in your shoes-- if she's mature enough to handle it (and that may not be the case.) Have you ever sat down with her privately and shown her photos of your daughter growing up, shared some of your memories and how devastating it was to lose her? Tell Beth that not a day goes by that you don't think of her. Your daughter is irreplaceable. You're glad that Scott found someone to share his life with and you hope that they remain happy together. You're glad she's become stepmother to your grandchildren. No one is saying that she's not as good as Abby, but she will never be able to compete with a ghost and she needs to stop trying. In fact, the more she pushes this issue the less likely it becomes that the kids will ever see her as any version of mom or that the two of you will have any sort of meaningful connection. Abby still lives in spirit and in the memories of those who love her. Beth can become a meaningful addition to the story but she can never just step into the space Abby left behind. She cannot just nominate herself to be your surrogate daughter. It has nothing to do with deserving. If that's too painful for her to endure, then I fear you're in for a difficult time. \n\nHaving said that, I invite you to consider ways in which you may hold some hidden resentment towards her for seeking to take your daughter's place. She is a reminder of what's been taken away, but that's not her fault. There's no manual for moving on and continuing to live and love after a beloved dies. Unfortunately, Beth has gotten herself into a situation that hasn't gone according to her expectations. Your daughter, in death, has become an immortal mother, someone almost perfect, even in their imperfections and idiosyncrasies, and just about everyone involved (perhaps including Scott) if they could would do just about anything to have her back. You've all got to find some way to live without her and Beth has to accept that she will always have a different place in your lives. It doesn't have to be lesser, but it will always be other. You're NTA but I do feel sad for Beth. She's seems very immature and/or unprepared for this responsibility, and she's truly suffering because of that.", "I am going to say NTA - but (going to play devils advocate) could she be feeling that you aren\u2019t accepting of her as the kids stepmom or mother figure? Have you said anything around the kids about her being not good enough? Or about these situations? Maybe not in the same room but could they have overheard? \n\nHer actions may seem unhinged but also the actions desperately trying to be seen as the woman who is raising 3 kids who are never truly going to be hers even if she sees herself as their mom/mother figure.\n\nI am going to point to the line where she says they don\u2019t call her mom because of you (the our fault). Something else seems to be going on at home that you are not aware of. \n\nYes she can never replace your daughter but a lot of stepmoms spend a lot of time feeling unwelcome or as imposters. And you stated that SIL is not close w his own mother which probably makes you the closest to an active mother in law for her.\n\nI am sure I am going to get downvoted but whatever. Like I said I am playing devils advocate and I am going to recommend that instead of just complaining to your SIL you ask him what is going on.", "NTA", "NTA and maybe y'all should stop inviting her over for a while", "NTA.

Not that it\u2019s an excuse for her behavior but it would make things make a little more sense. That being said, Beth sounds completely unhinged and I would recommend she gets into some kind of counseling immediately. The fact that because she married your SIL makes her your new daughter is ridiculous. Sounds like your family and Scott had been handling things beautifully until Beth wrecking balled her way in. I hope you can sit with Scott and have a frank conversation. Definitely NTA.", "Nta is she on another planet no one is ever going to replace your daughter, I wonder if she is as pushy with Scott's mum because it's a very strange situation on her part where she feels the need to be center of attention", "NTA. Beth needs help. Not only is she trying to take the place of the kid's mother, but trying to take the place of your daughter?? I don't know how Scott puts up with that.

I might get the confusion when it is a kid, but his woman is old enough to be married and still thinks this way... \n\nI seriously do not get that attitude.

She's not your daughter, she can never be your daughter, and there's something broken in her brain to think she can. I'm a stepmom and my boy lost his mom at a very young age. I met them 2 years after his mom had passed, when he was 4. His dad and I made sure he had a good relationship with his moms family, always getting him to family dinners, sleepovers, holidays, etc. Over 20 years, I've built a relationship with his moms family that I would consider like extended family, however I have never expected to be included in any of their family activities or have pics of myself in their home. In fact, we have made sure over the years to provide them with photos of my boy on his own when we do family pics.  \n\nI've been invited to the dinners or celebrations over the years, but with very few exceptions, I've excused myself if I'm able. They aren't my family and it's not my place to replace his mom, my place is to support him the best I can to have a relationship with her family. \n\nI really don't have a good suggestion to get her to snap out of her delusion, but I hope for the kids' sake she does figure it out before she does real damage to them. Good luck, OP. Keep doing everything you can to support the kids and help them keep their mom's memory alive, I have a feeling she's trying to erase her in their home. You might also help them to get any keepsakes or photos out asap to keep them safe.", "NTA.  Beth is horribly insensitive.  I\u2019m sorry you have to endure her.", "NTA. Beth is out of her mind. If I were you I would make it clear that one further crack about being apart of YOUR family (she is Scott's family, and maybe even your grandkids' family, but there is no world in which marrying your son-in-law gives her the right to usurp your daughter's place in your heart, life, and memory) and she will be banned from your home and any gatherings you hold, forthwith.   \nIf she cannot deal with reality and act respectfully, she does not deserve the privilege of being allowed in your life.", "This sounds like one of those made for TV movies where the nice innocent lady is really a psychopath. \n\nShe sounds like she needs mental help.

She loves Scott. And you are creating an arbitrary line (in your own grief at the loss of your daughter?) and forcing her to the other side of it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath, work out what they really want (trust me, you want a healthy relationship with Beth, because while she might be the step parent, she is going to be first on the invite list to those kids\u2019 weddings, before YOU if you make this problematic), and find a way to get along. No you don\u2019t have to put photos of her and Scott next to the photos of your daughter and Scott, but you keep saying they are family, and yet\u2026 really... They aren\u2019t.

Of course nobody can take Abby's place, not even another daughter as they are all their own person. \n\nIt also sounds like you're all having difficulty adjusting to Scott having a new wife which is understandable. That must trigger a lot of pain for you all as it's evidence that Scott and the children are starting a new phase of their lives, without Abby. \n\nPerhaps you and your family could all stop excluding Beth if Scott is there. For example, she may be included in big group photos, if Scott's in the photo she could be too.

She was married to Scott and had three children with him who are now 11, 12 and 14. Scott and my grandkids stayed part of the family and last year Scott remarried. His current wife is Beth. We all knew Beth for a few years prior to the wedding and she was always very friendly. Though at times she could be a little pushy. Scott would always handle that though. After they got married Beth's pushiness got worse and Scott appears to have lost control.\n\nBeth was upset when she dropped my grandkids off one day that we had not added photos of her to our house and commented as such. In our living room we have a display with photos of our kids and their weddings. She felt her and Scott's wedding should be there.\n\nShe was upset when my grandkids spent Mother's Day with us and our extended family and we did not include her. Scott wasn't invited either. Mother's Day is a difficult day for him due to a bad relationship with his own mother. But Beth said we should invite her too because she's part of the family and then she said she's one of our kids too. I asked her what she meant and she told me she is obviously going to be one of our kids now that she's the mother figure for our grandkids. I told Scott what she said and he was embarrassed and told me he would speak to her.\n\nBeth was also upset when my husband posted on Facebook to say something about our kids and she didn't get mentioned as one of our kids, but as Scott's wife (we mentioned Scott and how wonderful he was to Abby and how wonderful he is as a father).\n\nFor my grandson's 14th birthday, we were all together and he wanted a \"mom's side\" photo. Beth attempted to get into the photo and when Scott tried to remind her she said she's part of the family now. He pulled her aside and the photo was taken without her. But she told one of my sons after that she felt like we weren't treating her as a daughter and then said Scott never treated her as a lesser wife.\n\nWe saw them a little over Christmas and Beth was upset that we got them a joint gift (for her and Scott) instead of getting her one alone. She told me she's tired of feeling like she's not really family and she said she feels like we always put Abby first when she's here now. I saw red after this and I told her she can never take my daughter's place and the fact she ever thought she could is outrageous. She told me the kids call her mom and they think the world of her so why wouldn't we. I told her the kids have always called her Beth when I hear them and she turned around and said that's our fault because the kids should be calling her mom and they don't. She lost it from there. Beth stormed out and I explained what happened to Scott. He apologized and left the kids with us so he could speak to her.\n\nI think they worked it out but Beth said I was needlessly cruel to imply she's not as good as Abby and doesn't deserve to be our daughter.

It\u2019s possible your family is Scott\u2019s only family and Beth is being left out of a huge aspect of her husband\u2019s life.

I can see how she could feel that she isn\u2019t being treated apart of your family and to be honest it\u2019s because she\u2019s not. You shouldn\u2019t have to treat her as apart of your family.

She may not be your biological daughter but she's your daughter in law. Embrace her. Be happy the kid's have love around them.

That was entirely up to them, and neither he nor I pushed it. When we had our son together, he was treated like a grandchild as much as my other kids. \n\nAgain, there was no pushing on anyone\u2019s part. They lost their son. My children lost their father.

Yes, you were harsh, and yes, this undoubtedly hurt her feelings, but I can\u2019t think what else she expected with this kind of behavior.

Would she have wanted to push into your family if Abby and Scott had simply divorced? No. So this is even worse. It\u2019s disrespectful, rude and frankly insane.

She's going to double down with the kids now.", "NTA Of COURSE you aren't. But I am going to urge some serious caution here. Beth is totally delusional at BEST. And she seems to be very controlling. And you are the grandparent. And your daughter is no longer living. And those kids aren't old enough to insist on seeing you or to go see you independently. And for all intents and purposes, Beth is their mother. Do you see where I am going with this?\n\nThe VERY most important thing in this entire equation is your grandkids and your access to them, FULL STOP. You are taking for granted that you will always have access to them, and maybe you will, but few things are certain when a controlling and delusional, unstable person is a part of the equation. Especially when that person has power in the situation, which she does. More than you do.\n\nBeth is galling and insulting to a massive degree. I lost a son and so I UTTERLY appreciate your pain at the loss of your Abby. But I bet hard money that your daughter would also want you to do anything in your power to make the situation work for the sake of the kids she isn't here to raise. Even if that means giving in a bit and trying harder to have a relationship with Beth. Get her her own gift. Take her to lunch and talk to her. Split mother's day with her (she IS the one that is here raising them. Painful, I know, but it is also the truth). No amount of gall swallowing is too much as long as it means you have full access to those kids. Because she WILL start pressuring him to withold them from you. It is likely only the newlywed status she is in that is stopping it.\n\nI know this sounds terrible but I envy you so much. I would give everything I own to have a piece of my precious boy alive to love on in a grandchild. Let alone multiple grandkids. Nothing is as important as those children. Honestly, if it were me I would comply with every single thing Beth wanted because there is nothing more important than keeping that access to those children certain. There is no way Beth could ever replace Abby. So, knowing that do the things she asked for matter at the risk of having a rift with the woman mothering your grandbabies matter enough to risk what could happen? I hope I have not offended you here, I am just trying to go big picture and tell you what I would do if I was in your shoes. Shoes that I would give ANYTHING to be walking in.", "NTA. She sounds like someone who would off somebody and take their life over like name, family, ect. Im so sorry for the loss of your daughter and she\u2019s horrible for acting like she can replace her.

Id imagine Scott would have none of that, but when she\u2019s alone with them?", "It's bad enough that Beth is trying to erase Abby as the kids' mother, but to try and replace Abby as OPs daughter is disgusting and disrespectful.

Not saying Scott cheated, but Beth sounds obsessed with \"becoming Abby\" or taking Abbys life for herself", "I agree NTA, but just a thought. Does she have a family of her own? It\u2019s apparently not clicking in her head that this is an issue.  I would never want to replace a child of my own with another.

This is very worrying and I'm wondering if there is some sort of mental health issue here, like the hand that rocks the cradle.

Completely unhinged.", "Hmmm, the photo thing gave me pause. It was the kid who wanted the photo of \u201cmom\u2019s side\u201d and made me wonder if Beth is pushing more boundaries at home and the kids just want to have something that\u2019s theirs and a connection to their mom. Beth is pushing way too hard on too many boundaries and has completely misunderstood the kindness that OP and family have extended to her bc that is not the norm.", "Scott needs to shut this down a year ago, alas.", "The more I think about it, the more I think you have hit the nail on the head.

So, if what I'm reading is correct, Abby is upset she's not been included as Scott's wife/step-mother on Mother's Day (that's fair I guess, but for how long?), maybe she's also upset that **her** husband and their (shared) children to take photos and that this happens in every single photo/situation? I can understand this is an adjustment, and I'm sorry for your daughter, but why is Scott welcomed but not Abby?\n\nWhy does a \"mom's\" side photo include Scott? Let grandma have a photo with the grand children alone if that's what she wants, but what a strange loophole for Scott to avoid the situation entirely to gaslight his wife for a to avoid the awkward elephant in the room you've all invited to this party.", "YTA. If anything happens to Scott, Beth is going to take those kids and move as far away from you as she can.  And who can blame her?  You could be kind, and tell her that although she'll never be your daughter, she is the honored step-parent to your grandkids.  \nI also don't get why you expect HER step-kids to show up at your house on Mother's Day.  Scott should be starting the tradition that Mother's Day is spent with Beth and her family if she has any, because it's not Grandparents Day, it's MOTHER'S DAY. And if Beth's mother isn't in the picture, then celebrate with Beth alone, the woman who is taking over the parenting role for those kids.\nFor the grandson's 15th, Beth should have a celebration at her house without you. Have her family over, or have his friends over, or celebrate as a nuclear family.  Screw you since you don't think of her as family.  Why should she put up with that?  \nSo Beth will never take Abby's place.  Good.  Daughters aren't replaceable.  But choosing to accept some members of Scott's family and not others makes you a HUGE A**H*LE.

I can see from her position that she feels she's in unspoken competition with a dead woman, and she wants to be a part of your family, but you clearly don't see her as such.  It's obvious to me she feels she needs to push to force you to accept her.  It's obvious she can't and won't replace your daughter. That's a given. You don't have to treat her as if your son-in-law is cheating on your daughter's memory and she's the \"other woman\".  Ask yourself why she wants to be seen as a daughter figure. Maybe she doesn't have a great relationship with her own parents. You still have a great relationship with your son-in-law. She wants that relationship with you too.", "ESH.

Your daughter is gone, and I am so, so sorry for that. If this family sticks together, Beth is their mother and they are all going to need that support to work through this tricky period. \n\nReally, your relationship should reflect more what you want your grandchildren to have vs how you want to act. \nAt any point in time, Scott can stop visiting with the kids. Beth could convince him to move away because she feels so much animosity towards you. \n\nYou should be bringing her into your family like a daughter. I know I would want my parents to do that for my SO should I die. And I know his family would do that for my new husband should their son die.

Your daughters widower stayed in close contact with you after she passed and made sure you got to have a solid relationship with your grandkids.

To want to be treated like their daughter?  If Beth would have said I know  I will never replace your daughter but I'm going to be the best mother and wife I can be, there wouldn't be an issue.

Can you explain where you're getting your doubt to benefit from? It's not like what she's doing is harmless, and she is not the one dealing with the trauma of losing a parent/spouse/child. I didn't lose my parents, but they divorced when I was young and I ended up with two shitty step parents who liked to meddle and assert their authority where it wasn't appropriate. I would have preferred a disinterested but respectful step parent (or if they'd just stayed boyfriend/girlfriend) as opposed to the ones I got that constantly inserted themselves and stomped my boundaries, but I still had both parents.", "Does she? Why is she with these people then? She could skip seeing them entirely, but instead she\u2019s hoping for more of a relationship.", "This is what I was thinking, too. I almost think ESH. Beth\u2019s comment about Abby was absolutely insensitive and she did make an AH of herself, but it sounds like she\u2019s been taking pride in parenting her step-kids for years and wants to feel integrated into this blended family. I can\u2019t imagine the pain of losing a daughter, but I also can\u2019t imagine how hard being married to a widower must be. \n\nIt sounds like Scott is closer to his late-wife\u2019s in-laws than his own parents, or Beth\u2019s. If Beth is expected to **spend every holiday with Abby\u2019s parents** (and doesn\u2019t even get to spend time with her step-kids on Mother\u2019s Day) I can totally see how she\u2019d want to feel valued as an important member of the family. She is important and stepped up as a mother figure to OP\u2019s grandchildren. \n\nI think all the folks claiming she\u2019s jealously, psychotically trying to replace Abby are taking things in such bad faith. Some of her efforts sound a little delulu and tacky, but she\u2019s not a random girlfriend who should be grateful to even get an invite. She\u2019s Scott\u2019s legal spouse who has adopted his and Abby\u2019s children as her own. She enthusiastically chose to marry a widower with three children and has built her life around them. \n\nThe kids aren\u2019t adults and I think OP was an AH for twisting the knife by emphasizing that Beth isn\u2019t their mom. She\u2019s been their stepmother for years. She\u2019s had to love and support her spouse and stepchildren through the loss of OP\u2019s daughter, his wife, and their mom.

NAH for sure but y\u2019all need to start talking and realize Beth isn\u2019t going anywhere.  OP is systematically excluding Beth from every family event while making a point of including Scott, who is no more closely related to OP by blood than Beth is.  Heck, it sounds like she is deliberately trying NOT to have a relationship with Beth.  That is her prerogative of course, but I find it surprising that people can ignore the kind of mixed message this gives.  They are treating Scott like a son, but not her.  It isn\u2019t unreasonable of Beth to feel like she is being deliberately excluded, because she IS being deliberately excluded.  And while OP is not TAH for not loving or treating Beth like a daughter, Beth is also not TAH for feeling slighted.  You\u2019ve got a choice OP: either tell Beth you want nothing to do with her, or figure out a way to reckon with your grief for your daughter while still treating Beth like a human being and the mother of your grandchildren because, news flash, that\u2019s what she is!", "This is the most balanced answer I've seen so far.  To me, it doesn't sound like Beth is trying to replace Abby, it sounds like Beth is trying to be a mother to her husband's children.\n\nThe primary figures in these children's lives will be their biological father and their step-mother.  As you said, she is the one who is putting in the days and nights to raise them.\n\nThe grandparents seem to have an either-or mentality: they are acting like having Beth be the step-mother to the kids somehow invalidates their daughter also being their mother.\n\nBeth sounds like she is working very hard to be a part of her kids family, and her husband's former in-laws are working hard to keep her out.\n\nI'm sure there is a lot of pain to go around with the loss of Abby, but shutting out the kids current mother isn't going to bring her back or do any good for the kids.\n\nParents and step-parents are the immediate family to the kids; grandparents are extended family.  If the grandparents want to be a positive part of the kids' lives, they need to treat the Beth like she is a part of the family.", "I actually agree Beth is trying to earn love. She's not necessarily wanting to replace their daughter. She should be the one with the kids on Mothers day as if they ever hope to have such a relationship again a step mother will be a good thing for them. You should be happy Scott found a woman willing to love his children and him that's not always the case. Maybe talk about boundaries with Beth and find out why she is trying to get your approval so badly. Let her know gently that you don't wish to have a close relationship with her.

But again, it\u2019s on Scott to help her with that and he doesn\u2019t seem to be doing much of anything. IMO, OP is NTA but Scott definitely is AH and Beth is bordering on it.", "The photo thing sounded unhinged - i understood it was a photo of their maternal family not of mothers, she had no business in it. Her role as stepmother and a maternal figure to the children is separate and needs to be nurtured - and respected for sure, if shes not nuts, I get its hard, but her relationship with her husband's dead wife's family should be cordial and not much else. If it grows to friendship great. She will never be their daughter or one of their children."]}
