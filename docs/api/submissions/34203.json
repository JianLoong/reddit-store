She was married to Scott and had three children with him who are now 11, 12 and 14. Scott and my grandkids stayed part of the family and last year Scott remarried. His current wife is Beth. We all knew Beth for a few years prior to the wedding and she was always very friendly. Though at times she could be a little pushy. Scott would always handle that though. After they got married Beth's pushiness got worse and Scott appears to have lost control.\n\nBeth was upset when she dropped my grandkids off one day that we had not added photos of her to our house and commented as such. In our living room we have a display with photos of our kids and their weddings. She felt her and Scott's wedding should be there.\n\nShe was upset when my grandkids spent Mother's Day with us and our extended family and we did not include her. Scott wasn't invited either. Mother's Day is a difficult day for him due to a bad relationship with his own mother. But Beth said we should invite her too because she's part of the family and then she said she's one of our kids too. I asked her what she meant and she told me she is obviously going to be one of our kids now that she's the mother figure for our grandkids. I told Scott what she said and he was embarrassed and told me he would speak to her.\n\nBeth was also upset when my husband posted on Facebook to say something about our kids and she didn't get mentioned as one of our kids, but as Scott's wife (we mentioned Scott and how wonderful he was to Abby and how wonderful he is as a father).\n\nFor my grandson's 14th birthday, we were all together and he wanted a \"mom's side\" photo. Beth attempted to get into the photo and when Scott tried to remind her she said she's part of the family now. He pulled her aside and the photo was taken without her. But she told one of my sons after that she felt like we weren't treating her as a daughter and then said Scott never treated her as a lesser wife.\n\nWe saw them a little over Christmas and Beth was upset that we got them a joint gift (for her and Scott) instead of getting her one alone. She told me she's tired of feeling like she's not really family and she said she feels like we always put Abby first when she's here now. I saw red after this and I told her she can never take my daughter's place and the fact she ever thought she could is outrageous. She told me the kids call her mom and they think the world of her so why wouldn't we. I told her the kids have always called her Beth when I hear them and she turned around and said that's our fault because the kids should be calling her mom and they don't. She lost it from there. Beth stormed out and I explained what happened to Scott. He apologized and left the kids with us so he could speak to her.\n\nI think they worked it out but Beth said I was needlessly cruel to imply she's not as good as Abby and doesn't deserve to be our daughter.

Beth sounds nuttier than squirrel shit.", "NTA: Beth has some issues she needs to work out. Insecurities about her place in the family. That doesn't mean you have to make her feel like a daughter. It's lovely you invite her to family events at all. Many grandparents would only take the children.\n\nScott needs to work with her on this. Mother's Day can be a special day for the two of them to be kid free (Honestly, many moms would die for a day off!) It sounds like he is trying though.", "NTA. I'm sorry, but does Beth think that because Scott was married to your daughter, and now he's married to her, that she is (by some ridiculous logic puzzle) your daughter now? That because her husband's kids are your family, that she is too?\n\nYou don't owe her *anything*. You are accepting because she's now family adjacent, and because arguing with her could affect your relationship with your grandkids.

You are not wrong. She needs to understand her position is SIL\u2019s wife, and maybe step mom. If the kids want to call her that, it has to be their choice. But 7yrs isn\u2019t so long that they don\u2019t remember their mother. And her trying to erase her memory to them is just too far. She needs to learn her place.", "Yikes. \n\nNTA\n\nScott needs to shut this down immediately.", "NTA \n\nScott needs to reevaluate who the hell he married.

Do you have any idea her relationship with her immediate family looks like?\n\nIf she has no relationship with her family, it sounds like she was hoping she could have a family by marrying scott but since it sounds like he has a bad relationship with his mother and he's close and a part of your family she thought maybe she could integrate with yours???", "NTA.\n\nThat is some Grade-A audacity on her part. My head just can't wrap around how she thinks she is so special that she xan replace your daughter.

She needs therapy badly!", "INFO: Are you absolutely, completely certain Beth knows that Scott is your son-in-law, not your son? It's hard to see how she could not know that, but the only other explanation I see here is that Beth is batshit.", "NTA.\n\nShe didn't get adopted by you because she married Scott. She isn't and never will be Abby. She isn't her replacement because she's here now. You weren't needlessly cruel, you was truthful and honest. She's expecting you to jump into loving her like a daughter like Abby never existed or mattered to you, the kids, or anyone else.\n\nI don't know what type of delulu Beth has convinced herself with, but this isn't going to work out like she thinks. Of course, the kids don't want to spend mothers Day with her. She isn't exactly being subtle about the boundaries she's willing to skip across with you, I suspect that it's the same at home, maybe worse.\n\nBeth needs a therapist.", "NTA; might want to double check she\u2019s not pressuring the kids when Scott\u2019s not around, too. She seems to be trying to erase Abby.", "NTA. you are not scott\u2019s parents. you are the grandparents of his children. beth is your grandchildren\u2019s stepmother, she is not really related. it\u2019s INCREDIBLY weird to me she is trying to push herself into a family she\u2019s not actually part of.", "NTA.  She isn't your daughter, she is your grandchildren's stepmother.  End of story.", "Given the children\u2019s ages and the potential to have a relationship with them that does not necessarily need facilitating by dad (eg guessing the oldest at least has their own phone)I would be starting to slowly phase out the parents even if this includes dialling down a relationship with their father, unless he is prepared to address the issues with his new wife.  Invite the kids over, offer to take the kids out for the day. Unhinged step mother not included.", "NTA.\n\nDoes Beth have her own family?", "NTA. Good Lord. First, I am very sorry for your loss. Second, this sounds weird and a bit troubling. Beth is acting like she married your son after his first wife passed and you\u2019re not accepting her. But Scott is your son-in-law so really Beth has no actual family relation to you outside the fact that she is your grandchildren\u2019s stepmother and your son-in-law\u2019s wife. Even so, you accepted her as much as anyone would-or could-reasonably expect you too. She needs to accept her role in the family as it is-or speak to a professional if she can\u2019t.", "NTA she sounds a bit unhinged. She married your son in law. That doesn\u2019t make her your daughter!", "I think that Beth has forgotten that you did not marry or adopted her and that you aren\u2019t her husband\u2019s bio mother. I think her expectations for this relationship is all over the place and she\u2019s acquainting acceptance from you with acceptance with her new family.", "NTA.  It's weird to expect a widower's in-laws to accept his new wife as their own daughter. If she wanted a Mother's Day celebration with her stepkids, then she should have worked that out with her husband instead of trying to crash your event.", "NTA- Beth needs some serious therapy because she is out of her mind. Scott needs to rethink the marriage because she is going to damage the kids with the way she\u2019s acting. Stepmother from hell.", "Ummmmm..... How old is she? WOW...... You're her husbands in-laws (and not her family0. Of course she's NOT family. NTA. But she's unhinged.", "Nta. Block her from seeing your social media's.\n\nTell Scott that you don't wish to cause difficulties for him but Beth is no longer welcome at your house/events. Her constant disrespect of your deceased daughter is not acceptable and its causing your family further grief and pain.The kids are old enough to maintain a relationship outside a caretaker so if Scott isn't able to drop them off kr bringvthem around arrange through him a neutral location or collect form school etc. For that yo change Beth need to attend therapy and understand that her expectations/demands are unreasonable and hurtful and stops.", "What in the Single White Female...\n\nNTA.\n\nBeth married your son-in-law, not your son. At best, she's your children's step-mother, but has zero relation to you because no matter how much you love ***HIM***, her marriage *to* him doesn't make *her* **YOUR** daughter-in-law.

This is so triggering\u2026..NTA, but you have to let the father know you don\u2019t want anything to do with HIS wife, WHO is not your daughter, what does she want ?? everyone forget the mother of the kids I\u2019m here now??? Sheesh!!", "My mom died when I was four years old. Everyone involved is dealing with a no-win situation the best they can. \n\nKudos to Beth for *wanting* and *trying* to be a family member.

You are already going way above and beyond with how kind you are to her now. She has to have some self awareness that her very presence would not be possible if not for the untimely death of YOUR child. She\u2019s not even your daughter in law. She\u2019s your daughter\u2019s widower\u2019s second wife. You owe her nothing more than the cordiality you afford a stranger.", "She needs a therapist.", "I\u2019m going to give an alternate way of thing of this. You have lost one of the most important people in your world and she will never be replaced in your hearts. You also have a woman that wants to make your grandchildren happy, and wants a relationship with you as well. Maybe she\u2019s coming in a little hot, but she\u2019s trying. Isn\u2019t that better than someone who tries to keep those kids away from you? \n\nSometimes family chooses you.  Don\u2019t turn them away because of your loss. What would your daughter want?", "NTA it's weird behaviour from her to keep pushing this image but why isn't Scott doing anything about it? It must be upsetting to your grandchildren to watch what's going on. It doesn't sound like a healthy family life at all", "NTA did she really expect you to put her first over your daughter because she married your SIL?", "NTA\n\nThis is so strange... why doesn't Beth bark up Scott's parent's tree?", "NTA - that lady has mental health issues and needs to go to therapy.", "NTA. She ISN'T your daughter; she is married to the father of your grandkids. I get where she is coming from but she is going at it all wrong. \n\nShe is probably upset that the kids don't call her Mom and other aspects of her life that make her realize that she will never truly be their mother.  She needs therapy.", "This can NOT be real. If it is, Beth is insane. That is scary behavior!", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve been perfectly nice to Beth as Scott\u2019s wife, but she isn\u2019t and can never be your daughter and she\u2019s way out of line. Maybe she feels insecure about her status as Scott\u2019s second wife, but damn.

For an adult to not understand that boggles me.", "NTA Beth is unhinged \u2026 she needs to accept her place of his wife , she is not your child", "NTA - Beth sounds delusional and crazy. Poor Scott.", "NTA - You have no relation to Scott other than him being the guy who was married to you deceased daughter. Beth has even less relation to you.\n\nShe isn't family to you, she's just the step-mother of the grandkids who don't even treat her as a mother.\n\nThis is Scott's problem to deal with and if he can't then I see nothing wrong with what you said.", "This kind of scenario is sadly common. Beth is jealous and resentful of your daughter. She's treating death similar to divorce, in that the new wife should supplant the former one. This rarely works out in cases of divorce, but most people don't understand that death is not a failure of a partnership, and that a stepparent can never take the place of the deceased no matter what they do or don't do. If a parent dies when a child is four years old or older, which is the case with your grandchildren, they have living memories of their mom that can not be taken away from them. They may never call Beth mom and that's not due to anything you have done.\n\nYou have maintained a close relationship with your son-in-law and grandchildren, and that makes Beth feel even more excluded. There is no path forward for her. \n\nI do think Beth's expectations are unreasonable and that you're in no way in the wrong. Having said that, if you can find it in your heart to reach out to her, she might benefit from a day walking in your shoes-- if she's mature enough to handle it (and that may not be the case.) Have you ever sat down with her privately and shown her photos of your daughter growing up, shared some of your memories and how devastating it was to lose her? Tell Beth that not a day goes by that you don't think of her. Your daughter is irreplaceable. You're glad that Scott found someone to share his life with and you hope that they remain happy together. You're glad she's become stepmother to your grandchildren. No one is saying that she's not as good as Abby, but she will never be able to compete with a ghost and she needs to stop trying. In fact, the more she pushes this issue the less likely it becomes that the kids will ever see her as any version of mom or that the two of you will have any sort of meaningful connection. Abby still lives in spirit and in the memories of those who love her. Beth can become a meaningful addition to the story but she can never just step into the space Abby left behind. She cannot just nominate herself to be your surrogate daughter. It has nothing to do with deserving. If that's too painful for her to endure, then I fear you're in for a difficult time. \n\nHaving said that, I invite you to consider ways in which you may hold some hidden resentment towards her for seeking to take your daughter's place. She is a reminder of what's been taken away, but that's not her fault. There's no manual for moving on and continuing to live and love after a beloved dies. Unfortunately, Beth has gotten herself into a situation that hasn't gone according to her expectations. Your daughter, in death, has become an immortal mother, someone almost perfect, even in their imperfections and idiosyncrasies, and just about everyone involved (perhaps including Scott) if they could would do just about anything to have her back. You've all got to find some way to live without her and Beth has to accept that she will always have a different place in your lives. It doesn't have to be lesser, but it will always be other. You're NTA but I do feel sad for Beth. She's seems very immature and/or unprepared for this responsibility, and she's truly suffering because of that.", "I am going to say NTA - but (going to play devils advocate) could she be feeling that you aren\u2019t accepting of her as the kids stepmom or mother figure? Have you said anything around the kids about her being not good enough? Or about these situations? Maybe not in the same room but could they have overheard? \n\nHer actions may seem unhinged but also the actions desperately trying to be seen as the woman who is raising 3 kids who are never truly going to be hers even if she sees herself as their mom/mother figure.\n\nI am going to point to the line where she says they don\u2019t call her mom because of you (the our fault). Something else seems to be going on at home that you are not aware of. \n\nYes she can never replace your daughter but a lot of stepmoms spend a lot of time feeling unwelcome or as imposters. And you stated that SIL is not close w his own mother which probably makes you the closest to an active mother in law for her.\n\nI am sure I am going to get downvoted but whatever. Like I said I am playing devils advocate and I am going to recommend that instead of just complaining to your SIL you ask him what is going on.", "NTA", "NTA and maybe y'all should stop inviting her over for a while", "NTA.

Not that it\u2019s an excuse for her behavior but it would make things make a little more sense. That being said, Beth sounds completely unhinged and I would recommend she gets into some kind of counseling immediately. The fact that because she married your SIL makes her your new daughter is ridiculous. Sounds like your family and Scott had been handling things beautifully until Beth wrecking balled her way in. I hope you can sit with Scott and have a frank conversation. Definitely NTA.", "Nta is she on another planet no one is ever going to replace your daughter, I wonder if she is as pushy with Scott's mum because it's a very strange situation on her part where she feels the need to be center of attention", "NTA. Beth needs help. Not only is she trying to take the place of the kid's mother, but trying to take the place of your daughter?? I don't know how Scott puts up with that.

I might get the confusion when it is a kid, but his woman is old enough to be married and still thinks this way... \n\nI seriously do not get that attitude.

She's not your daughter, she can never be your daughter, and there's something broken in her brain to think she can. I'm a stepmom and my boy lost his mom at a very young age. I met them 2 years after his mom had passed, when he was 4. His dad and I made sure he had a good relationship with his moms family, always getting him to family dinners, sleepovers, holidays, etc. Over 20 years, I've built a relationship with his moms family that I would consider like extended family, however I have never expected to be included in any of their family activities or have pics of myself in their home. In fact, we have made sure over the years to provide them with photos of my boy on his own when we do family pics.  \n\nI've been invited to the dinners or celebrations over the years, but with very few exceptions, I've excused myself if I'm able. They aren't my family and it's not my place to replace his mom, my place is to support him the best I can to have a relationship with her family. \n\nI really don't have a good suggestion to get her to snap out of her delusion, but I hope for the kids' sake she does figure it out before she does real damage to them. Good luck, OP. Keep doing everything you can to support the kids and help them keep their mom's memory alive, I have a feeling she's trying to erase her in their home. You might also help them to get any keepsakes or photos out asap to keep them safe.", "NTA.  Beth is horribly insensitive.  I\u2019m sorry you have to endure her.", "NTA. Beth is out of her mind. If I were you I would make it clear that one further crack about being apart of YOUR family (she is Scott's family, and maybe even your grandkids' family, but there is no world in which marrying your son-in-law gives her the right to usurp your daughter's place in your heart, life, and memory) and she will be banned from your home and any gatherings you hold, forthwith.   \nIf she cannot deal with reality and act respectfully, she does not deserve the privilege of being allowed in your life.", "This sounds like one of those made for TV movies where the nice innocent lady is really a psychopath. \n\nShe sounds like she needs mental help.

She loves Scott. And you are creating an arbitrary line (in your own grief at the loss of your daughter?) and forcing her to the other side of it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath, work out what they really want (trust me, you want a healthy relationship with Beth, because while she might be the step parent, she is going to be first on the invite list to those kids\u2019 weddings, before YOU if you make this problematic), and find a way to get along. No you don\u2019t have to put photos of her and Scott next to the photos of your daughter and Scott, but you keep saying they are family, and yet\u2026 really... They aren\u2019t.

Of course nobody can take Abby's place, not even another daughter as they are all their own person. \n\nIt also sounds like you're all having difficulty adjusting to Scott having a new wife which is understandable. That must trigger a lot of pain for you all as it's evidence that Scott and the children are starting a new phase of their lives, without Abby. \n\nPerhaps you and your family could all stop excluding Beth if Scott is there. For example, she may be included in big group photos, if Scott's in the photo she could be too.

She was married to Scott and had three children with him who are now 11, 12 and 14. Scott and my grandkids stayed part of the family and last year Scott remarried. His current wife is Beth. We all knew Beth for a few years prior to the wedding and she was always very friendly. Though at times she could be a little pushy. Scott would always handle that though. After they got married Beth's pushiness got worse and Scott appears to have lost control.\n\nBeth was upset when she dropped my grandkids off one day that we had not added photos of her to our house and commented as such. In our living room we have a display with photos of our kids and their weddings. She felt her and Scott's wedding should be there.\n\nShe was upset when my grandkids spent Mother's Day with us and our extended family and we did not include her. Scott wasn't invited either. Mother's Day is a difficult day for him due to a bad relationship with his own mother. But Beth said we should invite her too because she's part of the family and then she said she's one of our kids too. I asked her what she meant and she told me she is obviously going to be one of our kids now that she's the mother figure for our grandkids. I told Scott what she said and he was embarrassed and told me he would speak to her.\n\nBeth was also upset when my husband posted on Facebook to say something about our kids and she didn't get mentioned as one of our kids, but as Scott's wife (we mentioned Scott and how wonderful he was to Abby and how wonderful he is as a father).\n\nFor my grandson's 14th birthday, we were all together and he wanted a \"mom's side\" photo. Beth attempted to get into the photo and when Scott tried to remind her she said she's part of the family now. He pulled her aside and the photo was taken without her. But she told one of my sons after that she felt like we weren't treating her as a daughter and then said Scott never treated her as a lesser wife.\n\nWe saw them a little over Christmas and Beth was upset that we got them a joint gift (for her and Scott) instead of getting her one alone. She told me she's tired of feeling like she's not really family and she said she feels like we always put Abby first when she's here now. I saw red after this and I told her she can never take my daughter's place and the fact she ever thought she could is outrageous. She told me the kids call her mom and they think the world of her so why wouldn't we. I told her the kids have always called her Beth when I hear them and she turned around and said that's our fault because the kids should be calling her mom and they don't. She lost it from there. Beth stormed out and I explained what happened to Scott. He apologized and left the kids with us so he could speak to her.\n\nI think they worked it out but Beth said I was needlessly cruel to imply she's not as good as Abby and doesn't deserve to be our daughter.

When we had our son together, he was treated like a grandchild as much as my other kids. \n\nAgain, there was no pushing on anyone\u2019s part. They lost their son. My children lost their father.

And you are the grandparent. And your daughter is no longer living. And those kids aren't old enough to insist on seeing you or to go see you independently. Do you see where I am going with this? \n\nThe VERY most important thing in this entire equation is your grandkids and your access to them, FULL STOP. You are taking for granted that you will always have access to them, and maybe you will, but few things are certain when a controlling and delusional, unstable person is a part of the equation. Especially when that person has power in the situation, which she does. More than you do.\n\nBeth is galling and insulting to a massive degree. I lost a soo n and sI UTTERLY appreciate your pain at the loss of your sweet girl. But I bet hard money that your sweet girl would also want you to do anything in your power to make the situation work. Even if that means giving in a bit and trying harder to have a relationship with Beth. Get her her own gift. Take her to lunch and talk to her. Split mother's day with her (she IS the one that is here raising them. Painful, I know, but it is also the truth). No amount of gall swallowing is too much as long as it means you have full access to those kids. Because she WILL start pressuring him to withold them from you. It is likely only the newlywed status she is in that is stopping it. \n\nI know this sounds terrible but I envy you so much. I would give everything I own to have a piece of my precious boy alive to love on in a grandchild. Let alone multiple grandkids. Nothing is as important as those children. Honestly, if it were me I would comply with every single thing Beth wanted because there is nothing more important than keeping that access to those children certain. There is no way Beth could ever replace Abby. So, knowing that do the things she asked for matter at the risk of having a rift with the woman mothering your grandbabies matter enough to risk what could happen? I hope I have not offended you here, I am just trying to go big picture and tell you what I would do if I was in your shoes. Shoes that I would give ANYTHING to be walking in.", "NTA.

If OP is more family to Scott than his own, Beth may be interpreting (with weird mental gymnastics) that since OP has pretty much \u201cadopted\u201d Scott as their son, that makes her their daughter.  my head hurts just trying to understand her.", "It confuses me too, but there are too many posts on this sort of topic for me to see it as an aberration anymore.  Someone or something out in the world at large is spreading this crazy viewpoint. It should really be stopped.  \n\nA partners former in laws owe new partner and any kids they bring into the relationship nothing beyond civility.", "I feel this is more on the husband. The children should still have a close bond with the grandparents, but why is the husband still spending time with them? Perhaps that is part of the problem. He has sort of moved on by getting remarried but not really because he is still spending holidays with his former in-laws? Maybe Beth is struggling because the husband is not making her feel secure, like she is just a replacement wife and mom but will always be second best\u2026 Beth isn\u2019t handling it well but I kind of feel for her.\n\nETA, OP is NTA. The husband sounds like he may be though \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My sister died early, it\u2019s hard to think of her husband dating someone who would be a mother figure in my nephew and nieces lives.  I\u2019d hate to have her around on the holidays tbh.  So in many many ways NTA for just being nice and swallowing that grief back to have her around.  But I understand Beth to a point, she\u2019s the only mom they have now, that\u2019s the situation.  The youngest was 4 when his mom died.  Maybe this is her family and she plays the mother role to them in their daily lives, and wants the kid\u2019s grandparents to make her part of the family, which I get, but you can\u2019t make people love you.  You darn sure can\u2019t demand it and you\u2019re being selfish to demand it out of people who lost a loved one.  I hope they can all learn to communicate better and express their needs going forward because this life is too short to fuss and fight like this", "Seems to me everyone involved needs therapy.", "Well, to play devil's advocate to your devil's advocate - OP lost her DAUGHTER. Beth is causing her grief by forcing her way into her life, in a role that is NOT HERS. \n\nIf she feels like an outsider when everyone is cordial, that's on her. She IS the outsider, and she SHOULD have way more grace for the family that LOST THEIR DAUGHTER vs making completely unhinged demands.\n\nShe is NOT the kids' mother. They are allowed to treat her as a step mother (or dad's wife as many people use instead). She doesn't get to force them to call her mom - that's up to them. We have no idea how poorly she's treating the kids at home.\n\nSo save your oh-so-clever devil's advocate perspective and consider reality, and what OP is dealing with.", "Whew, YTA saying a MIL is \"not a mom\"", "I replied this somewhere else, but to repeat myself, I don't think anything written in the post supports your idea that she's been \"blatantly excluded\". She is being invited to events with her husband. They included her in joint gifts (which, in my family at least, it's incredibly common for husband/wife duos to get joint gifts), and they included her in their Facebook posts. \n\nBeth's main complaint seems to be that they won't treat her as a replacement daughter. She's not. She has no right to be included in maternal family photos because she is *not a part of that family.* She is a part of Scott's family. These aren't Scott's parents. It's his family that has the responsibility to make her feel included, not his late wife's.", "Funny, when you have valid points but it doesn't agree with the majority, you get downvoted, rather than someone making a comment about why they disagree. Will probably get downvoted for this comment too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Agreed and agreed.\n\nBeth is nuts. OP put up with more than enough until now.", "Beth HAS a place. She's Scott's wife. She's the step mother of the kids-- and the kids and Scott are the ones who decide what that role looks like.\n\nOP might be close to Scott, but she lost her daughter. Beth forcing herself in shows absolutely NO consideration for the family who actually had a loss her. She's making herself a victim when she's LITERALLY the least victimized person. \n\nHonestly, it's fairly pathetic. OP has included her, but she is under no obligation to give her a role that is NOT BETH'S.", "Think about it this way. Let\u2019s say Scott and Abby divorce instead. If Scott remarried, his new wife would not be invited to things, she would not be called \u201cmom\u201d by the kids. It\u2019s the same difference in the reality of this situation. The fact that they have a good relationship with Scott is great, but even if they didn\u2019t, they\u2019d have zero obligation to invite Beth to anything. And don\u2019t say \u201coh but they do have a good relationship\u2026\u201d, that doesn\u2019t matter. Beth is NOT their family by any means and any kindness extended should be just that. Beth is WAY overstepping her role and bounds. That behavior should be nipped in the bud asap.", "This comment should be higher up. \n\nBeth is in an impossible position and it sounds like she\u2019s trying really hard to fit in and be part of the family since she is your grandkids stepmom now.", "You realize OP wouldn\u2019t have to do any of that if Beth wasn\u2019t pushing boundaries right ? They had a good relationship before the wedding.", "[removed]", "Where the fuck do you live where it's common for the new wife joins the dead wife's family? That's not common at all-- not even a little bit, certainly nowhere in North America, and very few places in Europe. \n\nIt's common for her to join her HUSBAND'S family. What kind of entitled BS is this?", "Why would Beth expect to join her husband\u2019s late wife\u2019s family? I could understand joining her *husband\u2019s* family, but OP isn\u2019t related to her husband. \n\nAnd they should involve Beth in Mother\u2019s Day activities IF the children want. It sounds like the children spend time with maternal relatives on Mother\u2019s Day to remember their mother.", "Dude they\u2019re not even related why should they have photos of her in the house. The only connection is their grandkid.

It sounds like they still are including her and inviting her to events that the husband is also invited to. That's perfectly normal behaviour. Joint gifts are also perfectly normal. Referring to her as his wife, perfectly normal. \n\nDemanding to be referred to as someone else's child? Unhinged. Demanding to have your wedding photo included in the home of someone you are not related to? Also, unhinged. \n\nIt sounds like Beth has some issues she needs to work out, possibly stemming from a bad relationship with her own family.
