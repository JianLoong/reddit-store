Your response was correct to this. You were TA to tell them you like Mary better and don\u2019t like Anne much. \n\nYou are also TA for not finding out what the conflict is about. It may be stupid high school stuff, but stupid high school stuff can have a huge effect on your life. There are some things in life that are unfair to ask someone to get past in order to have a cordial relationship with someone.\n\nThere is a serious conflict between your daughter-in-law and future daughter-in-law, which means it\u2019s also between your two sons. You are choosing to ignore it and act like it isn\u2019t a big deal even though it is seriously affecting the whole family. \n\nYou should consider having everyone attend meditation with a counselor to get to the root of the problem and to see if anything can be resolved. If everyone sticks to their sides and nothing is resolved, and likely won\u2019t be, then you need to be prepared to discuss a compromise with everyone while still under mediation. \n\nOP, you should prepare for possibly having to do things, like vacations, separately with each family. Everyone should likely (depends on what the issue is) be able to agree to do a Holiday here and there all together cordially enough. Since this is a them problem they can\u2019t solve, everyone should also agree that the brothers can spend time together and together with you, without wives or talk of wives, without interference or repercussions by wives. \n\nAlso, you should all discuss what happens when kids come along. There should be a hard rule that nothing bad is EVER said about the Aunt or Mother to or around children. Cousin relationships should not suffer because of parent\u2019s issues. Again there should be an agreement about being able to have all cousins together, without mothers (obviously when they are not babies) if needed, for get-togethers. Everyone needs to be on the same page and aware what the conflict, and its lack of resolution, means for future interactions and relationships. \n\nSorry OP. Sadly this is not something you can sweep under the rug or ignore. This is a situation where, while they are adults and need to be treated as such, you still need to be the parent.
