{"id": 28281, "submission_id": "170i9af", "title": "AITA for treating my stepson differently to my biological son?", "selftext": "I (38f) am a mother to my biological son Kai (10m) and a stepmother to my husband James' (42m) son from his first marriage, Luca (12m).\n\nThis subject has been the source of some arguments in our family so looking to get some honest opinions!\n\nJames and I have Luca every Thursday, every other weekend and parts of school holidays. Luca's mother remarried a man who is a lot wealthier than us and so the kid has a lot of nice stuff, designer clothes, games consoles, goes on fancy holidays with them etc. We aren't on the poverty line by any means but times are tough and we don't have a lot of disposable income right now.\n\nThis December I want James, Kai and I to go on holiday because we haven't been away at all this year. James wants Luca to come because he thinks it isn't fair if Kai goes on holiday and he doesn't. However Luca has been on fancy holidays abroad twice this year with his mum and stepdad, and we would struggle to afford flights, meals etc for a fourth person.\n\nWe didn't really argue about this as I think if James can find the money then Luca definitely should come, but it's more about this perceived 'unfairness' that I think isn't true. Because by that logic it's 'unfair' on Kai that he didn't also get to go on three holidays this year. (I don't think that's true, I'm just saying that logic cuts both ways)\n\nThe 'unfairness' rose its head last week again though when I bought Kai a Nintendo Switch because he did really well at school, and I didn't have the money at the end of the school year but I do now. James said to get 'big presents' for one child and not the other was again 'unfair'. It didn't seem to matter that Kai's was a reward (and that Luca has a Switch already anyway), but that I \"can't treat them differently\".\n\nJames gave another example that I occasionally take Kai to the cinema on a Tues/Weds (we have 2-for-1 tickets on Tues/Weds with our car insurance) but not on a Thursday when Luca can come. This is \"treating them unfairly\" even though it's purely a ticket cost thing - cinemas are so expensive if 4 of you go! (Of course, Luca goes all the time with his mum and stepdad...)\n\nSo now I'm a \"bad stepmother\" because of these examples... and I'm so frustrated by it. I love Luca and I'm not trying to exclude him at all, but our kids are in different situations and surely it's 'unfair' on Kai to not do nice things for him if we can't necessarily do it for both every single time. James has been quite nasty (he has a bit of a temper) suggesting I'm not happy to have Luca as my stepson, when that isn't true at all. AITA?\n\nedit: Kai is James' biological son. Sorry I thought that was obvious but I realise it's only obvious to me!!\n\nedit 2: yes, we should've amended the plans for the holiday to go to a more affordable place so that we can bring Luca, rather than making it reliant on the funds being available. I 100% accept that and I feel like an absolute idiot and a dreadful person for not immediately doing so.

Nothing.\n\nThe vacation issue: If you going on vacation is during time that Luca would normally be with you, then you should be taking him with you. If not, then you have no need to.", "NTA: I however think Luca should be asked to go on holiday with you because it\u2019s not about holiday it\u2019s about quality time with his dad.

I think you are both advocating for quality time with your children. I do have a suggestion though. You say:\n\n>This December I want James, Kai and I to go on holiday because we haven't been away at all this year.\n\nMaybe it would be better if it's just you and Kai that go on a holiday together, and then James and Luca can do their own vacation together as well.", "I don't agree with this \"everything with children needs to be fair bullshit\" every kid is different. Every situation is different. Sometimes one kid gets advantages; sometimes it's the other kid. Even with full siblings in the house at the same time full time. \n\nLife isn't fair and situations/ circumstances change. \n\nI have an 8 and 3yo. Sometimes running errands the 3yo gets hungry and gets McDonald's. Pick 8yo up from school and they think it's \"unfair\". Did I not buy you Starbucks yesterday morning and the 3yo didn't get anything? \n\nOr I bought 8yo BIG gifts for their bday/ holiday. They're 8. The gifts are usual bigger or more expensive in nature. Family claims it's unfair.  My 3yo got twice as many smaller gifts (still not equal in monetary value) but they're both happy, stop making waves. \n\n3yo gets a new hot wheel EVERY SINGLE TIME I get groceries once a week. 8yo claims unfair.  Um ma'am,  I give you $10 allowance each week. That hotwheel costs me $1.50. Do u want a hotwheel each week too or your allowance that you can spend on whatever you want? \n\nIt all evens out later. It's not unfair or favoritism at all. NTA", "I don't see a problem with the movie..life doesn't stop because Luca is with his mom.  And I don't see a problem with the reward switch (so long as Luca is similarly awarded things for success) but taking a \"family\" vacation without Luca is not OK.  It is all of you, including your husband, saying Luca is not part of the family.", "NTA your husband isn't being very logical or sensible about this.  All your reasons are valid.", "Info:  How is this vacation being paid for?  Because I'm curious why you're saying your stepson can come as long as your husband figures out how to pay for him.  Why aren't you figuring this out together?", "Nta how does Luca feel? Honestly when people have money, I find they don\u2019t actually care about it as much as people who don\u2019t. He probably doesn\u2019t even realize that Kai got the switch and he didn\u2019t type deal. I get the holiday thing but has james talk to his ex to see if they can work out a deal? Kai shouldn\u2019t loose out. This seems like a shitty situation but james is not helping", "Your husband is making really unfair comparisons. It should more focus on what you as a mother are doing for kai and what luca's mother is doing for luca. Similarly, if one were to compare how Luca's stepdad treats Luca, is your husband treating kai similarly? I guess not, so why don't you start making those comparisons, of how the step dads treat their step sons and then see if your husband understands the issue. \n\nNTA btw.", "The fact you mentioned your husband has a bit of a temper and is acting nasty towards you is a huge red flag to me.\n\nI watch a lot of true crime, and people described that way by their significant others or family members,friends, etc. tend to be extremely abusive.\n\n\nYou should probably look at your relationship with your husband before worrying about affording a vacation.", "INFO: OP, did you start dating James before or after Luca was born? Was James still married at the time?\n\nAnyone else notice the boys\u2019 ages are super close? Luca was probably just over a year old when OP got pregnant.", "NTA. But I suggest marriage therapy ASAP cuz I don't see this getting better as both boys get older & more expensive. \n\nTrip: as you noted, Luca goes places Kai can't. Perhaps your ex could ask his xw to split the cost of Luca coming with y'all.\n\nSwitch: You bought something for the child who earned it. A child who isn't gonna get it any other way/household.\n\nMovies: I agree with some of your logic, but perhaps if there is a movie you know Luca might want to see, see about swapping the Thursday that week to T/W for movie night.\n\nAt the end of the day, YOU are not responsible for providing for Luca.\nThat is what his mom & dad are for.\nIMHO, you & James need to discuss how this is going to work going forward.\n\nCollege is coming - does he expect your household to provide equal amounts to both boys even tho Luca will also have the resources of his mom?", "It honestly sounds like your partner is feeling insecure in his ability to provide for both of their children and is taking that insecurity out on you and your son.\n\nI really don't see how any of this is unfair to your stepchild or how rectifying the situation as your partner sees fit will make it more fair; wouldn't it just make it unfair in your bio kids favor this way, since he doesn't get all the same things that step kid gets from his legal guardians?\n\nNTA, but I think your partner is for projecting his feeling onto you and for potentially alienating his kids from each other and himself with this \"fairness\" nonsense.", "NTA but this is extremely complex stuff. There isn't any simple answers here.\n\nThe sad fact is, Luca is not a full member of your family. The reasonable thing to do is try to work out how to include him where you can, without making that the cause of Kai (and yourself) missing out. Your husband is working on the belief that Luca should be included in everything, which if he had infinite resources would not be a problem, but it isn't reality.\n\nIt might seem reasonable to split things, so taking Luca every other time you go to the cinema - but you can't feel half a part of a family. He's either one of you, or he isn't. It is likely that, as time goes on, Luca will start excluding himself from these events. If you don't take him on holiday with you this time, there probably won't be another. He's almost a teenager. Kai meanwhile gets less of a dad because of all of this, which isn't fair on him either.\n\nSo - key issue - communication with James. He's being an AH by making you the bad guy when the reality is, you have to make difficult choices due to limited resources. He's refusing to do that, and so you get to be the bad guy. Then he's blaming you for having to deal with the reality he refused to face. Pin him down, get him to see things from your point of view. Not that he has to agree to all your solutions, but that he does not get to say you are the bad stepmother for saying Luca shouldn't go on holiday with you without him being the bad father for refusing to take his other son and wife away even once this year. You should be able to debate these decisions without being accused of being a wicked stepmother. This isn't a disney movie.", "You aren't the ah for going to movies with only Kai. You are allowed to do mother/son things with your son. Not an Ah for the switch as that was a reward for hard work. Now, your husband can agree to give luca a reward for his hard work.\n\nYou would be an Ah to go on vacation without him. It doesn't matter if Luca goes on several vacations with his mother and step father. This is a family vacation and that is something you should all do together. \n\nSince you asked only about the vacation, YTA", "NTA - your husband is just feeling guilty and putting that on you", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is setting up the whole of the family to fail. \n\nYou're not Luca's mom. He has a mom. You're his dad's new wife. The whole of the family isn't mixing. There are clearly separations and boundaries. From what you've described, Luca has no reason to connect to you. From what your husband has implied, the only true real way for fairness is to have his previous wife include Kai in everything of the same standard has to be applied to Luca.\n\nKai knows there's a difference and a separation between families. Everyone does. Your husband is the one creating problems because he's trying to FORCE the situation to change. Your husband is the only one who is trying to change it. He's the one with a problem.\n\nBy pushing this, your husband would be creating a rivalry or a reason for Luca and Kai to dislike one another. They're kids and kids can easily be influenced by others, especially parents, and hold onto incorrect perceptions as they grow. Those perceptions can continue even if the reality is different. They can also harm a kids development.\n\nJames is most likely feeling inadequate and is using dysfunctional behavior to make himself feel better rather than accepting reality or getting help. If he's not letting go of this or seeing sense, he needs help. There's nothing good about what he's doing. Doing what he wants without the $$$ to fund it could lead to financial abuse.", "I don\u2019t think the situations you\u2019re comparing are the same thing though? Because you are Luca\u2019s stepmother and your husband is his father, Luca\u2019s mom is no one to you nor your son. It really shouldn\u2019t matter that you give your child gifts, but the vacation? Go alone with your son. Kai gets more time with James than Luca does. Also, I don\u2019t know why but I was getting like bad vibes from the way you talk about Luca getting gifts and vacations. Anyway YTA", "OP. I (and my sis) was treated totally different by my stepmother at my Dad's house than her kids.\n\nShe made it totally obvious that we were on a lower tier of respect than her own and she showed it in many ways. She thought we had it so good at my Moms house, just like you. She thought because my mom had a good job and we had things, our life there was perfect. What she didn't know is there we were constantly physically and emotionally abused and my Mom was never home because she worked 8-4 and went to school 6-10. My Dad's house was our place of refuge but since we were excluded there we had no adults in our lives we felt like cared about us and no adults we could go to if we had a bad day. In response I isolated myself from the world.\n\nAlways being excluded fucked me up and I cannot form relationships with peers or be in a romantic relationship because I don't trust anyone because that's what my Dad and Stepmom taught me with the obvious two-tier treatment.\n\nMovies and small things don't matter but the big things do. Kids don't have the emotional capacity to understand adult things. Like you're mentioning, money was the excuse we were treated not as well. Money is a huge point of trauma for me because it made me feel like a financial burden.\n\nAt this point since the poor treatment from her won't end and my Dad won't stick up for me after i've now had 3 \"come to jesus\" talks with him, I'm considering never seeing them again. I don't want that because I love my Dad but the ongoing poor treatment brings up the ongoing-trauma of the last 22 years. If they're never going to respect me as an adult woman, why should I?\n\nYour actions here may have big, long-term consequences and you need to be ready for them.", "definitely YTA whatever his son gets from his mother and her husband doesn't matter. you guys are going on a family trip and his son should be included. Now the gifts like the switch or going to the movies i don't see a problem with it.", "YTA, because of the family holiday.\n Both kids are James's sons. Even though Luca has spent time with his mother and stepfather, he also needs time with his father and brother.", "YTA\nIt is of no consequence what Luca does with his mother and her spouse.\nThat is HER family, they can behave how they like and they have no legal or genetic tie to Kai.\n\nHowever Kai and Luca share a father. That's your family. It is important that your husband treats his sons equally. You're his wife so, by extension you should treat them equally.\n\nIf you can't afford to take both children on holiday, you go somewhere cheaper or stay at home.\n\nIf you can't afford a present for both children, they share or they don't get a present.", "You're horrible.", "YTA. It is none of your business or concern what goes on at moms house. That never even enters the equation. In your house things need to be fair, period. Your husband is also an AH for allowing his kid to be treated like an afterthought. He needs to put his big boy pants on and make it clear this crap won't go on any longer.", "So both boys are half brothers and you prefer your own son. Yet you entered a relationship with a man who already had a son   You definitely can and should treat them equally \n\nTalk about the jealousy you show your stepson.   Christ sake do better as a grown woman", "YTA:  You're failing to realize something. Yes Luca has been on 3 vacations this year. But your husband has had 0 vacations with him this year. So don't you think when he gets one he would like his son to be with him?", "NTA\n\nThings just aren't \"fair\" it's just the way the world is\n\nFrom your reply it sounds like Luca is happy coming over & loves his little brother so it sounds like a James insecure issue to me", "NTA, for the holiday, yes both boys should get to go but if it\u2019s at a time where Luca isn\u2019t usually with you I understand why they wouldn\u2019t. \n\nBut the movies, they are on a day Luca is not with you.  \n\nThe switch, assuming you didn\u2019t give it to your son in front of Luca I don\u2019t see an issue there either. Maybe you did give it to him in the presence of Luca though and left that bit out? That would make you the AH and I see why your husband would have a problem.\n\nYour child shouldn\u2019t go without just because your husband also has a child. It would be different if Luca lived with you full time but he doesn\u2019t and the extras sound like they happen when Luca isn\u2019t around. I think husband just feels insecure about his limited financial situation.", "YTA. It's not about the number of holidays that Luca gets to go on verses holidays for Kai. It's about Luca getting the quality time with his dad.", "Yta.  You seem to be hung on to the fact that your stepson gets a lot of opportunities from his mother and stepfather.  That doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t get any from his father.  The fact that you and your husband earn far less than his mother and stepfather means that everyone has less opportunities.  You don\u2019t get to do more for your son because your stepson gets more stuff from his mom. It is your duty to spread your resources and opportunities equally amongst the two boys.  If you cannot afford to take both boys on vacation, then don\u2019t go.  If you cannot afford to take both boys to the cinema, then don\u2019t go.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to do things occasionally with just your son but if you never take your stepson to the movies, that wrong.  What rewards have you given your stepson?  Rewarding your son for hard work isn\u2019t wrong, but both should be rewarded for hard work.", "ESH - not bringing Luca at this age will hurt his relationship with your husband, now and in the future. \n\nYou deserve alone time with your son, so I think the movie time is nice. The switch example is fine alone too. But to exclude from what otherwise looks like a family vacation is different - that's how it's going to be remembered.

So don't let your husband make you feel bad. \n\nAs for the holiday? Well, I won't say you are wrong, but I don't think a shared experience like that and excluding your stepson will really help even things out. It's a family bonding event. Think of the good it can do instead of economic fairness. I think you can let him come and it be just fine. \n\nAs for a switch and movies? The switch is debatable. I personally favor you on that as long as your son is willing to share it under normal circumstances. I don't see the movies as bad at all, though. I think that is beyond nitpicking from your husband's side. If he really cares have him go pick up his son and take him to the movies. You can't put everything on hold for weekends.", "Nta what's your husband do for your bio son? Is he completely fair in every aspect or is he a hypocrite?", "I feel bad for Luca. He didn\u2019t choose to be second best to his father\u2019s family. The trope of the \u201cevil step parent\u201d is a thing for a reason.

However, unless you're leaving out some big details here, I think NTA.\n\nKai's switch was a reward, right? Not just a gift? That's fair. Plus, since Luca has a switch already this would enable the boys to play some games together and trade pokemon and all that crap. There wasn't a need to buy Luca one. And you could talk about giving Luca a reward for academic performance, but it sounds like you don't actually get to see him very often during school weeks so I can see why you wouldnt. Still, maybe bring it up with your husband.\n\nAs for the vacation, if his mom and stepdad can help contribute, or like you said if James can find the extra money, then yeah luca should come. But as you said, you dont have those funds, and luca has been abroad before with his mom and stepdad while kai hasnt.\n\nFor the movie tickets, maybe occasionally you can send luca and kai to see a movie together on a thursday using the 2-for-1 deal.

Maybe you could even use that time to do something nice with your husband", "YTA. Op you keep comparing what Luca mother does for him compared to what you and your husband can do for Kai. There is one thing that Kai has compared to Luca and that is he has both parents in the same household while Luca has to split households, and based off of the kids ages Luca was not even 2 years old when his dad started a family with you.", "NTA.

It is unfair to exclude Luca from family things.

The boys should be treated reasonably equally *by their families*; Luca has 2 families, Kai only has one. Luca's family owes nothing to Kai and it doesn't sound like they ever have Kai over or anything, he's Luca's half-bro but he's a non-entity to Luca's mother and stepdad. That's not unfair, it's just reality. \n\nThe movies are a non-issue because Luca isn't around on those days, obviously if he was at your home when you were taking Kai to the movies he should come too. But your family doesn't have to suspend its normal activities in wait for Luca to be there. \n\nThe vacation is a bigger issue, and I think Luca would feel rejected by his dad and stepmom if he can't come. Kai feels no such rejection because Luca's family isn't his family (he might be jealous, but it isn't a rejection by family).", "NTA. You need to fix this dynamic, and you might need more tact, but your husband James seems to think he got a second mother for his bio son, and that you can't have a separate connection with your biological son, the one that came out of you. \n\nHere's the problem. When you  married James you accepted Luca, you accepted that your husband is his father. It sounds like you sort of see him as having his own thing with his mum/stepdad and as a guest in your life, but to James when Luca is over it's one big family time. So to your husband you are dividing his family, while to you, you have a family of three plus another boy. \n\nThis can rip you apart if you're not careful. Dealing with multiple children is brutally hard timewise. I can't have like-to-like relations with all the kids in my life, and I can't always dedicate equal amounts of time to them. Sometimes I'm spending multiple evenings working on an essay with one, then it's driving lessons with another, then it's fishing with a third. I can't try to give them equal amounts of time each day or take them all fishing. But each kid needs alone time with an adult. Each kid needs to feel fully supported and feel my full commitment. And I can't wait for them to express that need, they shouldn't have to. I should pre-emptively be making meaningful time for each of them. \n\nYou are making meaningful time for you bio son. It sounds like hubby is making meaningful time for his boys. It sounds like you two need to figure out how to have meaningful \"all four of you\" time, I think that is what hubby wants. Because James has two sons. What happens elsewhere doesn't matter to him, you  married a dear man who wants to be a good father. How your husband treats Luca reflects on how he will treat Kai. If you start balancing out what the step-family does with what James does, you turn James into a half-father.

And that mostly it doesn't suit you if it costs you money.\n\nLook, I sympathise, truly. My sister is in a situation very much like yours, except that she is in James' position, where her oldest children have a father who is quite well-off, lives overseas, and can afford to take them on fancy vacations, etc. with his new wife, and she has additional children with her new husband, and they actually are very financially limited.

Luca's mother remarried a man who is a lot wealthier than us and so the kid has a lot of nice stuff, designer clothes, games consoles, goes on fancy holidays with them etc. We aren't on the poverty line by any means but times are tough and we don't have a lot of disposable income right now.\n\nThis December I want James, Kai and I to go on holiday because we haven't been away at all this year. James wants Luca to come because he thinks it isn't fair if Kai goes on holiday and he doesn't. However Luca has been on fancy holidays abroad twice this year with his mum and stepdad, and we would struggle to afford flights, meals etc for a fourth person. \n\nWe didn't really argue about this as I think if James can find the money then Luca definitely should come, but it's more about this perceived 'unfairness' that I think isn't true. Because by that logic it's 'unfair' on Kai that he didn't also get to go on three holidays this year. (I don't think that's true, I'm just saying that logic cuts both ways)\n\nThe 'unfairness' rose its head last week again though when I bought Kai a Nintendo Switch because he did really well at school, and I didn't have the money at the end of the school year but I do now. James said to get 'big presents' for one child and not the other was again 'unfair'. It didn't seem to matter that Kai's was a reward (and that Luca has a Switch already anyway), but that I \"can't treat them differently\".\n\nJames gave another example that I occasionally take Kai to the cinema on a Tues/Weds (we have 2-for-1 tickets on Tues/Weds with our car insurance) but not on a Thursday when Luca can come. This is \"treating them unfairly\" even though it's purely a ticket cost thing - cinemas are so expensive if 4 of you go! (Of course, Luca goes all the time with his mum and stepdad...)\n\nSo now I'm a \"bad stepmother\" because of these examples... and I'm so frustrated by it. I love Luca and I'm not trying to exclude him at all, but our kids are in different situations and surely it's 'unfair' on Kai to not do nice things for him if we can't necessarily do it for both every single time. James has been quite nasty (he has a bit of a temper) suggesting I'm not happy to have Luca as my stepson, when that isn't true at all. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You say that if stepson should automatically be invited with you and your husband, then your son should be automatically invited with them.\n\nBut your son has nothing to do with their family. He\u2019s not their stepson in the same way theirs is yours.\n\nIt might seem unfair that you would have a larger financial burden, but that\u2019s just the reality of having a larger family than theirs.\n\nTo put it another way, when they go on holiday it\u2019s just your son\u2019s brother who goes away. If you go on holiday, it\u2019s your stepson\u2019s brother and his own dad who are going on holiday - his dad without him.\n\nThe two situations aren\u2019t the same, if you really want to apply logic.\n\nI think YTA tbh. I can understand where you\u2019re coming from but disagree.", "Why would it be double the rooms to add one more boy?", "See, when you say \"all\"...", "Guess the weird part is why is it left to him.

Your husband really needs therapy.", "It sounds like Luca is loved when he is at your house which is what is most important.", "Super that you can see the sweet and thoughtful kid behind his expensive toys and designer clothes. The love and connection between brothers is very important and you, as loving and considerate person should focus on it.   \nAll in all, after years, your son won't remember what present he got to his 12th birthday, but will always remember the fun and joy you all have had on a family camping trip or an evening of board games.   \nSomething just occured to me - the cinema. Can't boys just go together to the cinema, without you? You can do some shopping or meet a friend in this time. I bet they would be very happy if they can go to the movies just they two. Of course, you or your husband have to drive them there and then fetch them, but two tickets are cheaper than four ;).", "> Like Kai is really not interested in football at all and Luca is, so James takes him to games.\n\nIf your partner can understand that this isn't a case of unfair treatment, they should be able to apply that understanding to these other situations as well. \n\nThat's why I was leaning towards them being insecure in their parenting, although it seems to be more focused on the child that doesn't live with you, which makes sense. The issue is that they're taking it out on you and your son by insulting/accusing you of being a bad mother to a child who isn't yours and expecting you to change how you interact with your child and theirs.\n\nI think they believe they're a bad father to their other child and are trying to overcompensate. It'll only lead to resentment from you and your son towards both your partner and your step son and probably sour the relationship on the step son's side of things with all you (including their dad) as well.\n\nI recommend this for everyone (lol), but both individual and family therapy might be a good thing here; especially for your partner and their insecurities.", "Also, on the movie thing - around me, matinees are still much discounted. Is that not a thing where you live, because doing a matinee once a month with both boys would seem to be a fun family thing? Maybe you skip the two-for-one for a week or two to make it happen?\n\nAlso - after listening to the Happiness Lab, it's experiences that make people happy, not things as a rule. So try to plan fun experiences on weekends.\n\nAlso, equity versus equality is an ongoing issue in many families. This should be explored with your husband either one-on-one or in parenting classes or couples' therapy.", "Luca spends the majority of his time with his bio mom and rich stepdad going on vacations and getting stuff. You're saying Kai can't have anything nice because Luca will be jealous the 1/4th of the time he's there?", "Yup. I was pointing out the problem as I see it. Luca is split between two families. It sucks to be the kid in the middle of a divorce. As I said further down - you can't feel half a part of a family. The father has a point. But so does OP. Better that they deal with it together than James dictate a bad solution and then cast OP as the bad guy.", "I think the reason people are hung up on the vacation and not the other things are because Luca\u2019s dad is involved with that. The other things you brought up are you doing things with your son, which isn\u2019t much of an issue, because as a stepmom, you really don\u2019t have an obligation to ensure fairness between your son and stepson. Luca has two parents, you\u2019re not one of them, of course you can prioritize your son to a certain extent when considering your own time and resources.\n\nWith the vacation, however, if there\u2019s a vacation where your husband can only afford to take one of his sons, then your husband is right that he just can\u2019t afford the vacation.

Coming into it with this mindset.\n\nThat said, you and your partner need to sit down properly and communicate, perhaps with a counselor to keep things less emotional. That you said something about a temper is a second reason to do so.\n\nYou spending 1-on-1 time with Kai is completely reasonable and good parenting. Every parent should try to get to know their children 1-on-1. Your husband should be doing the same with each of his kids.\n\nMy advice to **you specifically**, is to completely remove from your consideration anything that Luca gets or does with his mother and stepfather. They're actions are none of your business and should not be part of your consideration when dealing with the boys. The only exception that comes to mind immediately is sharing when at your house. A counselor might be able to assist in understanding reasonable boundaries for the boys as well.\n\nPretty much, talk. Talk to your husband until you know every angle of his perspective and he yours. Tear down each point you have to its foundation, then do it again. This is the only way to have true understanding of each other and, at least what I consider a true partnership.", "They're not your resources. They are family resources. And yes, they need to be spread in a fair manner among the boys. And we're more hung up on vacation.

If his father is willing to pay for Luca to come along on vacation, why would you try to prevent it?", "When do the brothers get to do fun outings (like the cinema) together?

It would be absolutely despicable to exclude him from this trip.", "So can I ask what does James do with Kai? \nI have read a lot of comments and responses and it all mentions James/Luca, Me/Kai. Where is James/Kai? I feel sorry for Kai if I\u2019m honest. \nWhen is it ok for Kai to do stuff with just his dad. Just because he lives with him doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t have time aswell. \nYou get moaned at for buying/spending time with Kai, but it seems that Kai only does \u2018fun stuff\u2019 when Luca is there.

The vacation is completely different to seeing a movie or getting a new console that the child already owns.

OP married knowing she would be a step-parent and that the child also had to be considered. \n\nIt's not the financial stuff Luca is gonna miss out on it's the experience of spending time together as a family.

A cheaper location, hotel or shorter vacation, you don't just push one child out because they aren't biologically yours and already had a vacation (out of their control) this year.\n\nEdit: I've just realised that the husband is the father of Kai. This means OP has been in Luca's life probably for 11 years. You've been in this child's life pretty much all their life and you still don't seem to see them as family.

OP should definitely talk to her husband about not saving all activities for when Luca is around.\n\nBut with the vacation aspect, that's one of those things where you just have to accept that life isn't fair, and certain things aren't going to be equal over all. Is it fair that Kai gets a single household and parents that are together, while Luca has to go back and forth, missing out on time with both his parents? No, but that's just the way it is. \n\nAnd what in my opinion they should be doing is just downgrading the vacation plans until their budget allows for everyone to be involved- some compromise is necessary. It's possible to have nice vacations without flying anywhere for most people, and the difference in hotel rooms for one kid versus two isn't huge. Kai does deserve a vacation, but I don't think he should be having one at the cost of the father never taking Luca on a vacation.

YOUR son can understand that he\u2019s got a second family so some things are a little different but instead you put the burden on your stepson to understand he gets nothing so you can give everything to your son because his mom has money.

It sounds like James doesn\u2019t want to live his life without Luca. And when Luca is there, he will do stuff with just him, which is complete BS.

She\u2019s clearly envious of the money that his mom has because she constantly is bringing it up to justify why Luca shouldn\u2019t get anything from her.

Get a grip, the father is being an AH. He's taking away from one kid on the principle of being \"fair\". At the same time, his son from another marriage gets all the perks because he has another set of parents that can provide for him and his father is taking away from his other son to also provide for him. That's ridiculous. OP NTA *at all*, and the father needs to stop being childish and controlling.
