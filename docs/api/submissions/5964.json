While his two daughters have been doing it, not without protest, his son insists he simply cannot. He says it is triggering for him because it remembers him about how he used to wet the bed until he was 13. I have no problem with this, there is aready enough people changing diapers and he is helping with other stuff but my husband insists that he has to do it and that if he keeps resisting we should punish him.\n\nMy husband says it is sexist for us to make his daughters change diapers but not his son but I think that is not a fair assessment of this particular situation.

He\u2019s traumatized, not sexist, and it is not a fair or correct correlation to  ask he swallow his feelings because it appears sexist. How would it make sense to encourage your boy to hide his feelings and fears (toxic masculine behavior) in order not to be perceived as a privileged white male? That\u2019s equivalent of girls who felt they had to be tomboys to not to be labelled like \u2018girly girls\u2019 - we know now that\u2019s just reverse discrimination (or whatever it\u2019s called). \n\nYour stepson is genuinely disturbed, and you\u2019re being a good parent by listening to his needs (and not letting a progressive ideal cloud his needs). Let him keep helping with the baby, he can help in other ways and it\u2019s important all kids learn they can do that and to accommodate each other at those times by picking up slack for each other.\n\nOn the househelp side, they\u2019re employees not servants. And it\u2019s definitely good your kids learn to be self sufficient and helpful because those employees don\u2019t work for them. They work for you. Kids can rely on the help when they afford and know how to manage employees - for now the staff help you and your husband manage the household and tasks you asssign. This differentiation was a game changer for us growing up with help. Friends who had servants and treated them as such had more entitlement and lack of compassion/respect toward their staff. You may actually miss where the privilege and entitlement can take root if you think having staff excuses kids from learning life skills and caring for others. Even at the expense of their own effort and sometimes discomfort (within reason), it\u2019s important we learn to care for others (especially when we don\u2019t have to).\n\nJust separate your objectives do not to get crossed wires.
