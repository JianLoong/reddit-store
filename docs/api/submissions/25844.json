I bought a great toilet from one of those giant stores and it was only $150.  New shower hardware including great rain shower shower head, knob and faucet for the tub portion was probably no more than a few hundred dollars.  You can replace what is there for a ton less than $1,200.  It\u2019s not that hard to replace those things since you already have the plumbing in place.  Probably the worst part is lifting the toilet out and the new one in.", "NTA. I would give her all the credit too.  \nLove your snark, \"beautiful coral colored toilet\".

You\u2019re factually correct that it was her idea, and I completely understand your frustration with her asking you to lie, but there\u2019s really no need to rub her face in it like this. \n\nJust get your contractor back out to install the new fixtures and be done with it.", "YTA.\n\nRather than dealing with the situation like a grown up, you are attempting to shame your wife with public contempt.\n\n[According to John Gottman, contempt is the number one predictor of divorce.](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-contempt/).

What do you hope to achieve by making snide remarks about the outdated items being your wife\u2019s doing? Either get over this issue and accept your current bathroom, or use your words to talk to your wife about updating the toilet and shower. If the plumbing is correctly located, you could DIY for a fraction of the cost.", "YTA\n\nYes it was her decision initially, but you agreed with her and decided to go along with it. There was nothing stopping you from calling the contractor and getting the desired changes. Once you agree with her it becomes a joint decision and you have equal responsibility. \n\nYou are only being petty and vindictive and trying to shame her.
