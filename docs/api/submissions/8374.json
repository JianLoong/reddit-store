And they will not be AHs for choosing their kids ahead of your wedding.\n\nOr you can say very bluntly - \"Well-behaved children are welcome.  Disruptive children and their parents will be escorted out\"  And enforce it.  This, however, is almost certainly guaranteed to stir the drama pot.\n\nBut saying \"cousin A\" can come but \"cousin B\" cannot is also going to stir the drama pot even worse  IMHO.", "YTA this isn't a childfree wedding. You have what sounds like many kids coming of a variety of ages. I can understand why others would be upset that theirs didn't meet a behavioural standard. Also, you had to know that when parent of kid that wasn't invited and showed up and saw other kids, there would be questions. Honestly I would go full child free.\n\nEdit - changed from NTA to YTA", "Overall you're **NTA**, but just barely, so you should probably consider a few things if you want to continue to not be the AH here, because you're teetering perilously close to that edge:\n\n1) It was super tacky to be discussing who is and isn't invited to the wedding at a family get-together with other relatives in attendance. Save those discussions for private. It wasn't your aunt's business, but she wouldn't have overheard if you hadn't been discussing it in a completely inappropriate setting, where you were very likely to hurt someone's feelings. \n\n2) Stop using the term \"child-free\" in reference to your wedding. That's not what this is, and when you use that term you sound like you either don't understand what it means, or like you're being a hypocrite (or an AH). You don't want a child-free wedding. You just want a wedding where you invite the people you want to be there, and you don't invite those you'd rather not have there. Which . . . is how all weddings work. Some of the invitees will be children, but you are not inviting every single child you are related to. That doesn't make it a \"child-free wedding\" OR a \"children welcome\" wedding. It makes it a wedding where people who are invited are welcome to attend. It's really that simple. \n\nAnd if someone asks why some kids are invited and others are not, or complains about it, the answer is just as simple: you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DISCUSS BEHAVIOUR, because that is rude and hurtful AF and completely unnecessary; rather, you say that, \"Regretfully, we obviously cannot invite every single person in the extended family to the wedding; we have chosen to include a handful of kids that we feel particularly close to, just as we've had to limit the adult invitations in the same way.\" Simple. If they argue any more, you say, \"I'm sorry, I\"m really not comfortable discussing this further.\"\n\nYou're NTA for now, but Y-W-B-T-A if you use the term \"child-free\" or otherwise present this as some sort of hypocritical selection process. Stop making things complicated.", "YTA\n\n\"I want a child free wedding, but with kids\" makes no damned sense.

It's 100% your wedding and you invite who you want, you're paying to feed and entertain your guests. I just wouldn't tell people you are having a child free wedding because your going to upset some parents who think their little terrors are angels.

Don't use that term unless you mean it.\n\nI'm kinda on the fence, but I think I'm leaning towards NTA. It's your wedding and you decide whom you invite. Nobody has a right to attend besides bride and groom unless invited, family or not. If certain family members would disturb the wedding or ruin the experinece for the both of you, not inviting them is absolutely valid.\n\nIt does leave a bitter taste though.

No doubts.", "NTA because technically you can invite anyone you want. However, by choosing some kids and not others, you're going to get push-back and it could be ugly and you will be see as an AH. You don't say how many children you want to have at the wedding, but my suggestion would be to not have children at the wedding OTHER THAN THOSE IN THE BRIDAL PARTY, and find a way to incorporate the children you want there into it. Be creative. \n\nOther options : 1) no children at the ceremony, but have them at the reception; 2) if there's somewhere at the venue large enough hire sitters and have all of the children there, if they have a TV stream the wedding in for those children who might want to watch; or 3) have the ceremony and reception child free, and have a party at your or someone else's home pot-luck style with anyone who couldn't attend and the children. Again, be creative.", "NTA you can invite who you want to your wedding but don\u2019t mention it is child free when it isn\u2019t. \n\nno one should be asking you to explain your wedding guest list although be prepared for some tantrums from the adults", "Unfortunately, by accepting only \"approved\" children you are now the judge.

But it is your wedding and you shouldnt have to include kids who potentially or likely will cause disruptions & chaos, and take the focus away from celebrating your nuptials.\n\nThe only way i can see you could possibly get by with doing what you suggested, would be to give all the kids that you want to have present for the wedding, some role in the wedding.  Maybe several flower girls/guys and maybe the older one could be an honorary bridesmaid.  That way you could send out invites honestly stating it is a child free wedding.  And if people come to the wedding and get upset because their precious little one wasnt invited  but they see other kids there, you can honestly say the other kids werent invited but were part of the wedding party.  If you choose this route, it would behoove you not to advertise in advance the fact that the younger kids are part of the wedding.", "ESH.

I wanted my daughter from a previous marriage to attend, but I did not want two certain nephews there.\n\nFor some context, we married at a wonderful winery, and alcohol was served. Children were actually allowed. However, I told my family that children were not allowed and that I paid extra for my daughter to attend. (I did not, but the owner of the Winery had no problem supporting my story).\n\nThe problem with my two nephews is that they do not respect anyone. At all. When I told my sibling that their children wouldn't be allowed to attend, one of them said he would just sneak in and that he would carry a knife in case anyone stopped him. My sibling laughed and thought it was a great idea.

For whatever reason some people think their kids are just fine. They need to be relieved of that misconception. You don't pile it on but 'well, Johnny deliberately knocked over Mary's cake and used the candles to set the drapes on fire and I'd really like to avoid that sort of thing' is perfectly reasonable. \n\ntbh, my family is fun, loving, kind, and direct. Any adult could rein in any kid if the parents weren't in striking distance (to be clear, no striking was involved). And we've had a time or two when my cousins were told by an aunt that if their kids kept it up they weren't invited to the next gathering because she valued her possessions. They were miffed at first but after asking around were told that yes, their kids were out of line and it was getting worse they took stock and things improved. Most don't like to be told they're wrong but if it's justified the honest ones will be grateful.\n\nMaybe this will be the wakeup call and that family will be honestly welcomed later.

Screamers well beyond the age where screaming randomly is acceptable. Kids are left to their own devices and any misbehavior is ignored or countered with trailer park yelling.

You will not be going CF because you don't intend to punish the well-behaved kids for the sins of their cousins. But I'm direct and not everyone likes that.\n\nMy take is too many people get away with bad things because others want to 'keep the peace' which I call cowardice. Now, babies cry, toddlers have meltdowns, some old people talk loud because their hearing is going and some folks have dementia. Point is, there are lots of valid reasons for people to do things that would take away from a silent occasion like a ceremony and some may even detract from a reception. But respectful people manage their behavior or that of those in their charge. So a parent keeps the little ones out of the church, a spouse gives the sign to lower the volume, that sort of thing. The person isn't at fault for what they do, but someone makes sure it doesn't bugger up someone's big day. But, when inattentive and unconcerned parents let their kids run wild, nope, all bets are off. These people don't suffer consequences and they should.
