Our house is full of food, I had just bought groceries. I went to the gym a bit before she was home, and on my way home about 8, I stopped for Arbys because I hadn\u2019t eaten anything to for dinner yet. My partner is a vegetarian and it was 8: I didn\u2019t bother asking if I should pick something up for her.\n\nBig mistake, apparently. She was pretty upset that I didn\u2019t call to offer even though she would have said no. It escalated a bit and I finally said something like \u201cI\u2019m not your caretaker\u201d. And I flipped the scenario: she\u2019d been home for hours and known I was out\u2026why didn\u2019t she think to offer me some dinner? That seemed to me a symmetrical consideration. \n\nShe then called her parents on speaker phone to ask them about their opinions on the matter: color me shocked they agreed completely with her and had some interesting remarks about how I\u2019m \u201calways so self-centered\u201d (but that\u2019s an issue for another time). \n\nThe whole thing left me feeling like I was being punked: I was honestly laughing till I realized she was being serious. So I am wondering AITA? It seems silly but this has become a major sticking point in our relationship, since we\u2019re at a pretty critical junction (about to move 7 hours away, looking at real estate together, etc). \n\nBackground: we both work full time. I work from home. Most of the time, I cook dinner for the both of us. I make coffee and breakfast (usually simple, like toast and eggs) every morning before work. She is perfectly capable of doing these things (I.e. no disabilities etc.) over the 4 years of our relationship probably 75% of the food she\u2019s eaten has been prepped by me: I don\u2019t make a habit of doing this sort of fast food thing.", "created_utc": 1680024659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124w3p3/aita_didnt_offer_fast_food_dinner_i_knew_she/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's likely been catered to by her parents her whole life, and now expects that from you.", "NTA. Her calling her parents about this is super childish", "She called her parents?? How old are you guys? \nI have never asked my family to get involved in my relationships. She\u2019s the AH.", "I disagree w/ posters - I think NTA. It would have been nice to have called her to see if she wanted something as a courtesy. \n\nWhat's up with her calling her parents? That's a whole other level of childishness right there.", "NTA. Based on how much you contribute food wise and this incident was not a repeat scenario, I would say your GF may be very childish and codependent. You normally take care of the food so she now expects it from you. With her being vegetarian, that does make quick fast food options a bit scarce depending on where you live. It is understandable that you assumed she had already eaten or prepared something since she had been home for a bit before you. I take it that she may have just wanted it to be offered even though she was going to say no, and that neediness can be a bit offputting for some.\n\nA HUGE red flag is when a partner involves their parents in a disagreement with their partner. Parental over-involvement will create tension. It is biased because 99.99% of the time, the parents will take their child's side, and no real issues will get resolved. I'm no counselor, but something tells me this relationship will only get more stressful with time if this keeps happening over something this small. Working these issues out before big plans like looking into real estate together could be a good idea.", "NTA. But the fact that you choose to live with a partner who behaves like a petulant teenager who calls her **parents!!!** for their opinion after a fight puts you very close to AH territory. She is a major AH because you just went food shopping and filled the kitchen with groceries. She should have made something to eat if she was so famished!\n\nYou need to seriously re-evaluate this relationship because the 2 of you are clearly NOT the only ones participating in it. And she called and put them on *speaker?* That\u2019s just creepy! RUN! It will not get any better!", "ESH. It's not end of the world,  call your parents but if I'm getting a treat/takeout/fast food to eat at home I'd always check with my hubby if he's home bc food envy is real. Doesn't Arby's have yummy poppers?", "ESH - it's a general unspoken rule that if you're out and you're bringing food home, you call the other household members and ask if they want anything. Yeah, she's a vegetarian, but those milkshakes are good, so are french fries. As to whether or not she could have made anything for you is a red herring. The topic was you didn't ask her.\n\nCalling her parents on speaker phone to discuss the was very immature and I believe your relationship squabbles should stay between the two of you. Her parents shouldn't be privvy to that information.", "nta\n\nbut i would think long and hard if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who calls her parents whenever theres an argument. thats ridiculous.", "For clarity: I\u2019m M31, she\u2019s F35", "Four years?  What the hell is actually fueling this?  There is so much more here we don't know, but based on the post NTA and yikes.", "ESH.\n\nThis isn't about Arby's. This is clearly an underlying issue regarding her not feeling cared for and thought of. You obviously share some resentment towards her as well.\n\nInstead of making snide comments at each other and phoning a friend\" to weigh in with bias, you both need to sit down like adults and work this out properly.", "Completely NTA. There isnt anything for her there anyway. Your not responsible for bringing her food! You need a new girlfriend!", "NTA.   \nShe needs to get over herself.", "NTA. Why are you with her?", "ESH\n\nAsking her even though you know she'd say no shows her that you care about her. It's a nice gesture to do for your partner. Doubling down instead of seeing that makes YTA.\n\nShe overreacted though. Which is why she's also TA.", "Man you need a new girlfriend", "So, your normal schedule that you cook for her?   \nDid you tell here before hand that you wouldn't be cooking today?", "NTA. You went Arby\u2019s \u201cWe have the meats\u201d so why would you ask? Also calling her parents is childish and petty", "ESH. You both could have offered something to the other, you both didn't.  Why would you offer fast food when she doesn't eat it? That makes no sense, other than maybe she would have said \"could you stop at X for Y for me instead please\"\n\n She called mommy and daddy? Red flag to me, IMO.", "ESH\n\nYou got home after 8pm. Your partner was home from 6pm. \n\nShe easily could have made dinner already--you both should have communicated the plans for dinner then imo.\n\nYou decided to go out and grab fast-food, a place you knew didn't have options for what she eats. You could have asked her if she'd like you to pickup something else on your way home and you didn't.\n\nShe made it a bigger deal than it is.\n\nRelationship just sounds immature. You guys should effectively communicate plans for dinner or have fall-backs. If she knew you'd be out late at the gym after work, she probably should have had known to make dinner, or at least ask you about it. You also could have quickly called after the gym to ask if she'd like fast food.", "ESH\n\nWhat the fuck with your gf calling your parents in order to ask them about their opinions on your relationship??\n\n>It escalated a bit and I finally said something like \u201cI\u2019m not your caretaker\u201d. And I flipped the scenario: she\u2019d been home for hours and known I was out\u2026why didn\u2019t she think to offer me some dinner? That seemed to me a symmetrical consideration.\n\nNeither is she your caretaker.\n\nPlus, as far as I know, there was nothing that you could get from Arby's for her, if she's vegetarian.\n\nOP, you should think twice or have a chat with your partner before moving somewhere else with her, she shouldn't be asking her parents what they think about what you do. Yes, she could do a little bit more for herself, but that doesn't mean that any of you should take care of each other, unless you want to.", "ESH. You could have still called and asked if she needed anything on the way home. I know my man does that and we both work full time too. However, it does sound like she is entitled and taking you for granted. Unless she is somehow making up for your majority share of the cooking, it sounds like a big imbalance in the relationship. Expecting you to do the majority cooking without contributing equally in other ways is not healthy unless there is full understanding and acceptance on both sides. Calling her parents is a big AH move too. This is a problem you two need to work out and it's none of their business. Does she normally use them to fight her battles? If so, then that is going to be a huge problem. Sounds like you two need to work a few things out before going forward.", "ESH. You both neglected to communicate what the dinner plans were, so were both at fault here. \n\nNot knowing if she\u2019d already cooked for you, you should have called to ask that and let her know you were stopping for food regardless. And she could have wanted a drink or dessert, but you didn\u2019t ask. \n\nShe should have asked you if you wanted her to make something to eat together after the gym and not freaked out about not being asked about your fast food (though I think it was mildly rude).", "ESH \n\nI suspect that it\u2019s not about food, per se, it\u2019s probably that she has grown accustomed to you providing dinner and when you didn\u2019t, that disrupted her routine and expectations. \n\nSo she was probably hungry and feeling disrupted, and communicated her frustration poorly. You escalated it. \n\nI hope y\u2019all can communicate and sort this out", "ESH, Inconsiderate not to ask.\nEdit to ESH,  wht tf is she calling her parents.  This is a calm discussion between you two about how she felt not being taken into consideration.", "YTA - there\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t realize that she gained 100lbs. You\u2019re either exaggerating or she knows.", "ESH\n\nYou tell your sigoth if you're picking up food, regardless of where from, to see if they want any OR you pick them up something you know they'd like even if they don't end up being hungry.\n\nIf money is tight, and you can't afford a second meal, then eat at home \ud83d\ude02\n\nHer calling her parents, or anyone to include them in the argument in the moment, was completely inappropriate and borderline toxic behavior. Not healthy communication in a relationship at all, but it seems that's part for the course here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
