Our house is full of food, I had just bought groceries. I went to the gym a bit before she was home, and on my way home about 8, I stopped for Arbys because I hadn\u2019t eaten anything to for dinner yet. My partner is a vegetarian and it was 8: I didn\u2019t bother asking if I should pick something up for her.\n\nBig mistake, apparently. She was pretty upset that I didn\u2019t call to offer even though she would have said no. It escalated a bit and I finally said something like \u201cI\u2019m not your caretaker\u201d. And I flipped the scenario: she\u2019d been home for hours and known I was out\u2026why didn\u2019t she think to offer me some dinner? That seemed to me a symmetrical consideration. \n\nShe then called her parents on speaker phone to ask them about their opinions on the matter: color me shocked they agreed completely with her and had some interesting remarks about how I\u2019m \u201calways so self-centered\u201d (but that\u2019s an issue for another time). \n\nThe whole thing left me feeling like I was being punked: I was honestly laughing till I realized she was being serious. So I am wondering AITA? It seems silly but this has become a major sticking point in our relationship, since we\u2019re at a pretty critical junction (about to move 7 hours away, looking at real estate together, etc). \n\nBackground: we both work full time. I work from home. Most of the time, I cook dinner for the both of us. I make coffee and breakfast (usually simple, like toast and eggs) every morning before work. She is perfectly capable of doing these things (I.e. no disabilities etc.) over the 4 years of our relationship probably 75% of the food she\u2019s eaten has been prepped by me: I don\u2019t make a habit of doing this sort of fast food thing.", "created_utc": 1680024659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124w3p3/aita_didnt_offer_fast_food_dinner_i_knew_she/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's likely been catered to by her parents her whole life, and now expects that from you.", "NTA. Her calling her parents about this is super childish", "She called her parents?? How old are you guys? \nI have never asked my family to get involved in my relationships. She\u2019s the AH.", "I disagree w/ posters - I think NTA. It would have been nice to have called her to see if she wanted something as a courtesy. \n\nWhat's up with her calling her parents? That's a whole other level of childishness right there.", "NTA. Based on how much you contribute food wise and this incident was not a repeat scenario, I would say your GF may be very childish and codependent. You normally take care of the food so she now expects it from you. With her being vegetarian, that does make quick fast food options a bit scarce depending on where you live. It is understandable that you assumed she had already eaten or prepared something since she had been home for a bit before you. I take it that she may have just wanted it to be offered even though she was going to say no, and that neediness can be a bit offputting for some.\n\nA HUGE red flag is when a partner involves their parents in a disagreement with their partner. Parental over-involvement will create tension. It is biased because 99.99% of the time, the parents will take their child's side, and no real issues will get resolved. I'm no counselor, but something tells me this relationship will only get more stressful with time if this keeps happening over something this small. Working these issues out before big plans like looking into real estate together could be a good idea.", "NTA. But the fact that you choose to live with a partner who behaves like a petulant teenager who calls her **parents!!!** for their opinion after a fight puts you very close to AH territory. She is a major AH because you just went food shopping and filled the kitchen with groceries. She should have made something to eat if she was so famished!\n\nYou need to seriously re-evaluate this relationship because the 2 of you are clearly NOT the only ones participating in it.

Doesn't Arby's have yummy poppers?", "ESH - it's a general unspoken rule that if you're out and you're bringing food home, you call the other household members and ask if they want anything. Yeah, she's a vegetarian, but those milkshakes are good, so are french fries. As to whether or not she could have made anything for you is a red herring. The topic was you didn't ask her.\n\nCalling her parents on speaker phone to discuss the was very immature and I believe your relationship squabbles should stay between the two of you. Her parents shouldn't be privvy to that information.", "nta\n\nbut i would think long and hard if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who calls her parents whenever theres an argument. thats ridiculous.", "For clarity: I\u2019m M31, she\u2019s F35", "Four years?

This is clearly an underlying issue regarding her not feeling cared for and thought of.

Why are you with her?", "ESH\n\nAsking her even though you know she'd say no shows her that you care about her. It's a nice gesture to do for your partner.

You could have asked her if she'd like you to pickup something else on your way home and you didn't.\n\nShe made it a bigger deal than it is.\n\nRelationship just sounds immature. You guys should effectively communicate plans for dinner or have fall-backs. If she knew you'd be out late at the gym after work, she probably should have had known to make dinner, or at least ask you about it. You also could have quickly called after the gym to ask if she'd like fast food.", "ESH\n\nWhat the fuck with your gf calling your parents in order to ask them about their opinions on your relationship??\n\n>It escalated a bit and I finally said something like \u201cI\u2019m not your caretaker\u201d.

That seemed to me a symmetrical consideration.\n\nNeither is she your caretaker.\n\nPlus, as far as I know, there was nothing that you could get from Arby's for her, if she's vegetarian.\n\nOP, you should think twice or have a chat with your partner before moving somewhere else with her, she shouldn't be asking her parents what they think about what you do. Yes, she could do a little bit more for herself, but that doesn't mean that any of you should take care of each other, unless you want to.", "ESH. You could have still called and asked if she needed anything on the way home. I know my man does that and we both work full time too. However, it does sound like she is entitled and taking you for granted. Unless she is somehow making up for your majority share of the cooking, it sounds like a big imbalance in the relationship. Expecting you to do the majority cooking without contributing equally in other ways is not healthy unless there is full understanding and acceptance on both sides. Calling her parents is a big AH move too. This is a problem you two need to work out and it's none of their business. Does she normally use them to fight her battles? If so, then that is going to be a huge problem. Sounds like you two need to work a few things out before going forward.", "ESH. You both neglected to communicate what the dinner plans were, so were both at fault here. \n\nNot knowing if she\u2019d already cooked for you, you should have called to ask that and let her know you were stopping for food regardless. And she could have wanted a drink or dessert, but you didn\u2019t ask. \n\nShe should have asked you if you wanted her to make something to eat together after the gym and not freaked out about not being asked about your fast food (though I think it was mildly rude).", "ESH \n\nI suspect that it\u2019s not about food, per se, it\u2019s probably that she has grown accustomed to you providing dinner and when you didn\u2019t, that disrupted her routine and expectations. \n\nSo she was probably hungry and feeling disrupted, and communicated her frustration poorly. You escalated it. \n\nI hope y\u2019all can communicate and sort this out", "ESH, Inconsiderate not to ask.\nEdit to ESH,  wht tf is she calling her parents.  This is a calm discussion between you two about how she felt not being taken into consideration.", "YTA - there\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t realize that she gained 100lbs. You\u2019re either exaggerating or she knows.", "ESH\n\nYou tell your sigoth if you're picking up food, regardless of where from, to see if they want any OR you pick them up something you know they'd like even if they don't end up being hungry.\n\nIf money is tight, and you can't afford a second meal, then eat at home \ud83d\ude02\n\nHer calling her parents, or anyone to include them in the argument in the moment, was completely inappropriate and borderline toxic behavior.

I note that my mother would absolutely agree with her and her parents and she would *throw a shit fit at me* if I didn't get her food or at least offer her food. Some people are like that, probably the \"acts of service\" love language people in particular. In her language, you just proved that you don't care about her, unfortunately. \n\nI hate to say it, but what you probably should have done was hit some fast food joint that had reliable veggie options (I presume if you've been with her long enough, you know which ones better than I) and gotten her something.", "NTA. Were some of the things, just a smidgen harsh\u2026 like the \u201cI\u2019m not your caretaker.\u201d, though not any less true\u2026yeah. But\u2026would I have made the exact same comment and made a hypocrite of myself on the same situation\u2026also\u2026.yeah. \n\nIt didn\u2019t even have to be a \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you cook for me?\u201d scenario. If she didn\u2019t want to cook all she needed to do was text and say \u201chey, are you picking up anything after hitting the gym?\u201d That way she could find out quickly and in the most undisruptive way if she would be fending on her own for food that night. It\u2019s super easy and takes less than a minute. Nevertheless, she didn\u2019t ask, so she cannot be mad that you didn\u2019t tell. \n\nYou\u2019re exactly right that it makes her a hypocrite via the example you provided her. And not only is she a hypocrite, she is an immature and petty hypocrite. Worst kind, if I might add. Gtfo while you can", "NTA", "NTA. If you had called, she probably would have gotten mad at that, too, and said something like \u201cafter all these years you still don\u2019t know that I\u2019m a vegetarian\u201d?

And this \u201calways self centered\u201d thing seems to be a big backstory of accusations and toxicity.", "I don\u2019t have any comments about you dinner thing but her calling her parents to involve them in your issues seems like more of a big deal to me. I personally had this issue with my husband until recently and it\u2019s not a fun experience. \nLike usually when we fight or have difference in opinions he would usually say call your mom and ask her if this is weird but during one extremely sensitive matter I did the same where I called his mom and he was so embarrassed and mortified. It\u2019s stopped now but it\u2019s extremely childish and doesn\u2019t actually help to involve other people in your relationship issues be it small or big.", "NTA but calling her parents to take her side is a red flag. Don\u2019t underestimate this issue", "Is this how you want to live your life?", "ESH here for lack of communication. Sit down and have a conversation about what\u2019s really going on because there are bigger issues here than dinner.", "Wow, she is 35 and called her parents??  Good luck with the relationship, one knows it's tanked when the gf or bf involves parents on minor arguments. \n\nNTA", "Rule number one: never don\u2019t bring snacks. Snacks always welcome. Need snacks. French fries are available at Arby\u2019s. Anyway, probably unpopular opinion buUUUuuuut **ESH** she didn\u2019t need to flip out and call the parents. And OP you flipping it around like that was super poopy of you.", "NTA. You could've called and asked, sure. But you don't for various reasons. You're not an AH for not asking. She'd been home for awhile, she could've eaten something or called to ask what your plans were. She's not an AH for not doing that either. She is an AH for bringing it to her last parents like that. Your relationship is between you two. \n\nDon't buy a house with someone you're not married to. Don't buy anything with debt with someone you're not married to. That's financial advice 101.", "ESH. I\u2019d be super peeved if you were my boyfriend and didn\u2019t think to offer to bring me food - that\u2019s pretty inconsiderate. Even if you don\u2019t think she\u2019d say yes, it takes what, 30 seconds to text her and ask? \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have called her parents though, super weird and an asshole move.", "Your girlfriend's parents said that you are self-centered because they're mad at you for taking their daughter away. Take their opinions with a grain of salt. NTA. Your girlfriend is being unreasonable.", "She's 35. Thirty fucking five. Tattling to her parents.", "Idk that one negates the other. Being inconsiderate and not asking if she wanted something isn\u2019t suddenly not rude because she tattled on him. It\u2019s ESH for me.", "Um\u2026where in the post is there anything about her weight?", "**crying** I\u2019m needed this laugh. Thank you.  I will find the perfect award for this lovely moment!", "The \u201cnot your caretaker\u201d comment was better than the flipping the narrative to blame her\u2026 ESH", "Arby's fries all food in the same oil.

I\u2019m embarrassed for her.", "I think you're responding to the wrong comment of mine.", "If you don't eat meat and then eat something fried in animal fat or the same oil as meat, you can get sick. It might not happen every time, and it doesn't happen to every vegetarian/vegan, but it happens. Even those who don't take a moral issue with it may avoid fast food fries because of that", "Not necessarily. Many vegetarians include animal fats in the same category as meat (which makes sense) \n\nSo no fries or anything else cooked in animal fats. Or gravy that uses meat broth. \n\nNo cheese if animal rennet is used.\n\nNothing that uses gelatin.", "Oh. Wait isn't most cheese made with rennet? Does that mean my fucking vegetarian spaghetti recipe I've been making not vegetarian BY TOPPING IT WITH MOZZARELLA.", "My apologies, I\u2019m a little hangry and not thinking clearly. \n\nNo one got me Arby\u2019s today, if you can\u2019t tell.", "Maybe.
