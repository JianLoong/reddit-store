Normally we stay at the lake, but this year we're staying at an air bnb with a pool.\n\nThe first few days, his little cousin (14F) wasn't getting in the water. I asked her why, she let me know it was her \"time of month.\" I asked if she uses tampons, she said no, she doesn't like them as they are uncomfortable. I left the topic alone and just tried to console her. \n\nA few days later, she's in the water, but her older sister (17F) is not. \n\nHer(17F) boyfriend, who's also 17, is staying here with us, and he's playing with the kids in the water while she sits out with the dog. \n\nI asked her the same thing, was she going to get in the water today? She said no, it's also now her time of month. I said if she liked to use tampons, she said she doesn't mind them but her mom doesn't want to buy them for her (for what I assume are misogynistic reasons, bf's family is very very traditional.)\n\nI got kind of upset and told her that I would buy some for her tomorrow (today) and keep them in my room if she needed any. I mentioned in to my BF later on and said I thought it was weird that her mom prevented her from using tampons. \n\nHe told me I should definitely NOT buy any for her as that would not only overstep her mother (which I understand) but also \"send the wrong message.\" I asked him what he meant, and he starts spewing out misogynistic nonsense.\n\nBasically his points were \"she shouldn't be putting anything up there,\" so I reminded him that tampons are sanitary and non-sexual, and that since it's a pool vacation she will miss out. He said it's about \"protection\" which really pissed me off. I mean the girl is 17 years old, a senior in high school, her boyfriend is literally here with us, (Like newsflash???) \n\nHe was very respectful about it and said it was just his opinion, but I'm still upset over this ideology. That's not the point of the post though.\n\nWIBTA if I bought my BF's little cousin tampons today so that she can get in the pool water??", "created_utc": 1689352781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zla5k/wibta_if_i_bought_tampons_for_a_teenager/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would you ever want your potential future children to be with a man who thinks tampons or not OK? I wouldn\u2019t buy them NTA.", "NTA - beyond how archaic the ideology they consume is - you didn't give them to her, you told her that you'd get some and keep them in your room if she wanted any. You made her an offer that she can take up or refuse and didn't force it on her. If you had given her the box and insisted she use them then maybe I'd see where an issue could arise, but there's nothing wrong with empowering her to have the option.\n\nAlso, jfc why do people still believe in this bs?", "YWNBTA for buying her tampons.\n\nHowever if you stay with someone who actually believes that kind of ignorant misogynistic nonsense, you would be.", "NTA.\n\nI had a similar experience as a young teenager where my grandmother said tampons were for married women only. Such a ridiculous opinion to have and my cousin bought some for me because it\u2019s what I preferred to use at 15. Tampons do not take away your virginity. If a girl wants to use it she should be able to! Her parents\u2019 lack of education is sad.", "You really wana be in a relationship with a perso. Who sexualizes inserting a tampon? \n\nGirl, No. NTA\n\nBut id buy her some low key, dont say anything else about it to anyone. Enjoy whats left of the vacation, go home and dump this boy.", "NTA. Like you said, it's for sanitary purposes. Your bf and his family are making it sexual for no reason. After this vacation, I'd take a long good look at who you're with. If you guys end up getting married, he'll do the same to your daughter (if you have kids)", "NTA you are not forcing her to use them you are just telling her where to find them if she wants them. But \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9on the BF", "NTA\n\nAlthough if you're in a place where there's a nearby shop that she could purchase her own tampons, you could simply hand her a $20 and have her go get them herself.\n\nThis all just bewilders me because by 17 I was buying my own supplies anyhow. My mom had NO input and I would have been creeped out if she'd tried to have input.", "There is such a fucked up and creepy need some people feel to \u201cprotect\u201d a girls vagina. It\u2019s nauseating. Prohibiting her from using tampons at 17 years old is outrageous. You\u2019re NTA, but I\u2019d buy them for myself and offer one for pool time.", "NTA. \n\nHer bf is literally there with them??? What do they expect is going on with her and the bf. Their reason of the tampon giving a sexual stimulation is just thrown out the window logically since the bf is there. \n\nThat logic and ideology is so so disgusting. I would consider leaving him simply because that\u2019s not someone I\u2019d wanna deal with or be around that type of family long term. They sound like they\u2019d be horrible in laws.", "Nta. Uhh your boyfriend is a misogynist.", "NTA - you did a nice thing for the girls, but please stop and take a long hard look at your relationship.  That's great that your BF was very respectful while spewing his misogynistic nonsense, but this is how he will be with any children you have.  If you stay with this man and have children with him, he will not allow his daughters to use tampons in order to protect them.  And honestly, it makes me wonder if he's judging you for using them as well.\n\nI mean, lord only knows what other deep-seated idiotic ideas he's hiding from you.", "NTA. Some of these people in the comments are insane. It\u2019s a tampon - it\u2019s not her mum\u2019s right to ban them. She\u2019s not buying them probably in fear he mum finds them, but OP is offering to keep them on her person and since it\u2019s a shared house, OP would also probably take the blame for any in the washroom bin should the mum be insane enough to see one and start bringing in the priests so she can be wed to the tampon that took her innocence. \n\nPlus considering 17F said she doesn\u2019t mind them, I\u2019m gonna bet she\u2019s probably used one already. Borrowed from friends most likely.", "You\u2019re wrong about one thing. The ideology IS the point of the post. This family (and I am including your partner) is fully of misogyny and simply inaccurate positions pertaining to women\u2019s health.

Certainly before you have a child that will be raised in that circle.", "NTA if you just buy them and leave them in your room for her to make a choice. Minor or not, I strongly believe that 17 is old enough for a person to make their own choices concerning menstrual hygiene. Who would even know?\n\nIf you and BF are sexually active then you should consider your future based on what he told you. Because at best might be a hypocrite, at worst he just told you what he thinks your value is.", "NTA. People who think tampons are sexual in any way need to get over themselves. I\u2019ve used them almost exclusively for most of my bleeding life and it has never once felt sexual.", "NTA. Parents' preferences are unimportant when it comes to what kind of sanitary products their kid uses, especially when it's restricting their daily activities. \n\nI refuse to wear tampons personally, but that's out of choice as I find them uncomfortable. I would never forbid my daughter from wearing them.", "I have no judgement on the issue as a male but your boyfriend\u2019s behavior is.. startling. I would be reevaluating that decision after this is done.", "NTA.  At least BF is \"respectful\" in his backwards views and being clueless?  OP, be thankful for this insight into how he views women in general, any potential children, and perhaps you as well.", "NTA.  As to your bf's opinion - why is he weighing in on something that's none of his business?  He needed a heads-up in case she stopped by the room, but he should not be talking about his sisters' private parts.", "Nta but does anyone else find it weird that the parents won't buy tampons for a 17 YO but they bring her BF on a 10 day trip?  That seems....odd.", "NTA. Run from this dude. It's not traditional. How can it be traditional when tampons are a relatively new invention? It's misogyny straight up. It's only religious if the family ALSO wouldn't let a male gynecologist examine her. Such a crazy idea from ignorance, borne now by assholes' wings. \n\nAs far as the girl. You already told her uncle, who agrees with the parents. There will be drama for the girl. Since you aren't inserting it yourself, I can't see how you would get in trouble. Also, maybe it would give her some confidence that this is messed UP.", "NTA for buying menstrual products for people that need/want them. Definitely not cool staying with a misogynist who spews deeply ignorant and harmful bullshit no matter how respectfully he does it.", "The concept that a period and tampons is sexual is misogynistic and outdated. All women have periods and use sanitary products. It\u2019s completely ridiculous to associate using a tampon with intercourse. Your bf and his family are living in the dark ages and you may want to find someone in 2023. Huge red flag for you!!!!", "Where tf do you live where people are so sexist they don\u2019t allow tampons ??? Lmao", "NTA, but be prepared for a lot of BS if these backwards people find out about it. My biggest concern is how they will treat this poor girl if they find out. Are they going to start making wild assumptions she\u2019s sexually promiscuous or shame her? If I were you I would buy them and then pretend to be on my period myself if anyone asked (if box/wrappers were found in garbage bin etc). That would require your bf being ok with keeping up that lie though. He sounds very misogynistic and likely to start a huge argument with you about it even if his family never finds out. Personally this would be a HUGE red flag to me and I wouldn\u2019t want to date someone with these views or be forced to vacation with people like this.", "NTA\n\nProviding teenagers with appropriate menstrual\nsupplies and educating them on how their bodies work is actually associated with higher self esteem and increased bodily autonomy as an adult.\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to admit that you\u2019re the one who got her tampons. There are also ways they can be discreetly hidden in things like make up bags or pencil pouches. Her family doesn\u2019t even have to know. Just make sure that she knows that she needs to remove them frequently, to avoid touching the tip before inserting them, and to wash her hands before and after use. \n\nI think one of the nicest things someone has ever done for me in high school is lend me a tampon when my period came early. There\u2019s so much shame surrounding that as a teenager. Trust me, you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "WTF with everything I just read...\n\nYour boyfriends family sucks. \n\nYou are NTA", "NTA let the girl enjoy her vacation and you may need to have some serious convos with bf soon", "NTA\u2026but run girl! Like he clearly has the same views as his parents\u2026at some point he will have those views towards you or any daughters you have, if you get married and have children.\n\nRUN!", "NTA for meaning well, but this is a battle you won't win. Please consider if you want to continue a relationship with a misogynistic AH who doesn't understand basic female anatomy. His entire family sounds disgusting and I pity his sisters.", "Him saying \"it's about protection\" and making it sexual really feels like he's saying \"protection of her virginity\" or maybe even her hymen (yes I know that's not all girls and gets torn my a million things but he definitely doesn't think that way), and that using a tampon or inserting anything might equate to no longer being a \"true virgin\" or some backwards, misogynistic garbage. Get the tampons for the poor girl and GTFO of the relationship if anyone objects, you are NTA for explaining women's bodies and looking after this kid.", "Aaaaand this is why people's opinions need to stop being presented as facts.\n\nCos people, more often than not, are wrong.\n\nNTA.\n\nBuy the tampons, applicator variety, few different sizes if possible, and let them both know if they have questions about how to use them.\n\nPeriods are crap, and absolutely something we should not be kowtowing to in 2023 because of outdated ideas over tampons. They should be enjoying the holiday too.\n\nSounds like they've grown up hearing negative shit about tampons so it might take a while to undo that damage.", "Op as a 45 year old male.  Tell your \"BOY\" friend he needs to grow the fuck up", "I cannot believe people like this still exist", "NTA. Buy them. What\u2019s wrong with your BF, and what are you getting out this relationship?", "I would say buy them but keep it a secret between you and the cousin. If something happens or someone finds out and gets upset then at least you can have the peace of mind knowing that you did the actual right thing. \n\nNTA", "NTA and I feel so sorry that those girls are being raised to think that their bodies are meant for men to use", "NTA, buy some of thr maxi ones for display purposes and going forward, make orgasm noises when inserting tour tampons so that your bf can get his head out of his ass. A polite misogynist is still a misogynist.", "NTA. But to deal with their views without overstepping, I got some period swimwear from the store before because I can't use tampons. This might be a good alternative?", "NTA - I\u2019d tread carefully for her sake, she\u2019d be the one that will get the backlash if the family find out. Keep them in your room and available for her, if she wants to take you up on the offer she can. \n\nAlso maybe time to reevaluate your relationship given your boyfriends misogyny. Doesn\u2019t matter how \u2018respectful\u2019 he is, he still views women and consequently you as less than him.", "NTA!!! I cannot BELIEVE people are against this!!! **TAMPONS DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO YOUR BODY THAT COULDNT ALREADY HAPPEN NATURALLY.** I cannot seriously fathom this logic. I cannot fathom anyone forcing their daughter to sit in diapers for a week every month because theyre not *allowed* to use a significantly cleaner methodology.\n\nIMO? Buy her tampons and dumb his useless rear end behind. This kind of way beyond prude behavior makes me feel like youre all raising nuns. \n\nI seriously. Cannot believe. Her family is sexualizing tampons. At 17. Omfg", "NTA. I was raised with these beliefs that in my case were cultural miseducation because my I\u2019m a first gen American. I didn\u2019t wear tampons until I was 22 because no one had ever taught me to wear them and I was terrified of hurting myself because of my lack of education about it. 17 is old enough to know what kind of sanitary items she prefers and make decisions about it without input from parents. \n\nI do agree you\u2019re going to have sit down with the boyfriend after this trip and see if you can educate him directly or if this is a lost cause. If it is a lost cause, ask yourself if you want to have this argument with him in 10-15 years about your own potential daughters if you want children.", "NTA,  people need to get over it. There's nothing sexual about tampons. Keep his view in mind if you ever consider marriage or children with this man.", "this is crazy to me. im muslim wear hijab and all, things people consider \"very religious/traditional\" and my dad has been buying me tampons since i was 15 lol. id even text him and specify which brand\n\nNTA but I imagine it would be the girl in a very hard spot if her family found out, so you SHOULDN'T buy her tampons, as unfortunate as it is.\n\nI'd also dump ur bf", "NTA for buying tampons- just make sure she is aware of the risk of TSS and knows to changes them frequently.\n\nEnjoy your vacation!", "NTA but your bf\u2019s family(not the daughters)sounds like assholes including your bf. This just seems like some serious misogyny and we all know the main source of that. Even if saying it gets you banned from this sub.", "NTA,\n\nYikes. Her mom must be one of the weird ass evangelicals that think tampons and dildos are the same thing.", "Buy her a diva cup instead, no cramping, shorter period and less evidence for mom to find.", "NTA- because, well, common sense.\n\nBut I wonder if you still want to stay with your bf. Do you want these people as In Laws?", "NTA if she comes for them that\u2019s her choice. Nothing wrong with giving her the option. Mom doesn\u2019t need to know everything, and honestly has no say on this matter. It\u2019s her body.", "NTA. buy her some tampons, teach both girls how to use them, and throw in some sex ed while you\u2019re at it bc i guarantee they\u2019ve only been taught abstinence, if anything at all.", "I think you would be the asshole for not, now. What if she asks you for one and you broke your promise? All you told her was you were buying tampons and she can ask for them. You\u2019re just buying tampons not forcing her to use them. Tampons are so much more comfortable and it\u2019s super weird people want to be in the business of monitoring other people\u2019s snatches. YWNBTA.", "Tell your boyfriend he needs to stop using toilet paper, because nothing should be touching his ass. Also, YWNBTA, but do you really want to stay with this heathen?", "NTA. Buying someone a necessary hygiene product is never the wrong thing. Your BF is being a moron.", "Think about whether you would want someone with this attitude to someday be a father to any daughter you might have.", "NTA.

I wouldn\u2019t try to change their way of thinking it just won\u2019t happen", "Don't get involved in this till she's 18 at least (get away from these people they sexualized a kids privates and a tampon) and I don't usually tell people run away from relationships but RUN", "You can tell him til you're blue in the face that these ideas are misogynistic, but he learned them from the woman he loves and (presumably) respects most, so that's likely to be a losing battle. He may come to realize the foolishness of it eventually, but it's going to be a lot of work and a long time to unlearn what he's been taught. \n\nThe girl will be an adult soon and can make her own decisions then. If you're inclined, you could say something about how those ideas don't match your experience and if she needs products or advice she can come to you, but I'd leave it alone beyond that.", "NTA. These girls should have accurate education and a choice about what they do with their own bodies. \n\nTheir family need proper education as well. What a bunch of misogynistic ah\u2019s. \n\nAnyone who thinks tampons are destructive, or in any way sexual, or dangerous, or somehow wrong, is an ignorant piece of trash.", "NTA\nJust the hero these teenage girls need on this vacation.", "Your heart's in the right place, wanting the girls to be able to enjoy time in the water, which is why I'm voting NTA. I would definitely ask the parents if it's okay to buy her some JUST so she can get in the pool.", "NTA This rhetoric is so ignorant and misogynistic. Putting in a tampon is like the dentist\u2019s finger in your mouth after the freezing kicks in. There\u2019s little sensation mostly pressure and it\u2019s kind of creepy until you get used to it. It\u2019s the opposite of sexy and with experience becomes like blowing your nose. I don\u2019t get why anyone would think a dry cottony-papery skinny little cigarillo thing could feel good. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA, and I'd say either try to find a way to break the cycle of misinformation/misogyny with your boyfriend.  If that doesn't work, definitely think about whether or not this is someone you wanna spend your life with.\n\nI dunno if you want/plan on having kids, but if you end up having a daughter with him, there is a HIGH likelihood that he will try to pass on his (very very shitty and wrong) opinions to her.  MIL absolutely will, and having to fight with grandma forever doesn't really sound super fun to me.", "Tidbit for the younger girl that said they're uncomfortable: my daughter is a very small 11 year old and she is not comfortable even trying a tampon yet, and I completely understand, so I got her period swimwear (a plain black bikini bottom so she can match with any of her other swimsuits when needed). Seems to work great so far. \n\nThat said, nta, and your boyfriends opinion has absolutely, like below zero, no weight here. A 17 year old is old enough to go out and buy them on her own if she even wanted, let alone to take then from a family member.\n\nEta, because AITA is insane, this isn't a reason to dump your boyfriend. He's just ignorant right now. He can learn.", "NTA, in fact you should do it. These teenagers deserve better and helping them is the morally correct thing to do. Overstepping their mother and \"sending the wrong message\" is a good thing to do.", "Not a AH but I think you should just stay out of it. If that's her mom's rule even if it's idiotic don't encourage her to break it. As for your relationship I think you guys should really talk about your beliefs on things now so you can end it if you're not compatible.", "NTA!\n\nBut just an fyi, you are overstepping her mother and this will create issues in the family if you plan to stick around.", "You have brought up several points. The tampons, her mothers decision, her motives and your bf opinions and reasons. \nWhile your opinion about tampons is certainly valid, you are not the girls mother and she is a minor. You have the right to protect her from abuse, but not to make decisions about her health especially when you know it is not something her mom agrees with. \nWhether you agree with her mom is a different matter. It really doesn\u2019t matter why she decided this. It\u2019s not your choice. \nYou have the right to disagree with your bf and/or his reasons. That also is a different matter\nWhile you are clearly concerned and wish for the girl to have a good time, You would be TA if you did this. Let mom and daughter reach their own conclusions as well as bf, whether you are in the relationship or not.", "Men should have no opinion.", "YTA\n\nParents get to raise their kids according to their values. Maybe try talking to mom. Say you noticed the girls skipping out on swimming and ask her if she needs tampons and start a genuine conversation. Going behind a parents back to talk about anything at all with their kids is creepy.", "NTA\n\nIt would be good to have a talk with your boyfriend tho. His opinion is bigoted and wrong, but I've met COUNTLESS of people who share the same idea. It comes from a place of ignorance, usually learned from parents/other authority figures. I remember growing up and having many friends not wanting to use tampons, because they didn't want to \"lose their virginity\". \n\nI know it sucks and you shouldn't feel obliged to do it, but have a talk with your bf, maybe send him some articles about the issue. If he still refuses to see how harmful his ideology is, I would reconsider your relationship with him.", "Unpopular opinion, but YWBTA. It\u2019s not your kid, so you don\u2019t have a say in the matter. I strongly disagree with the family\u2019s thoughts in this matter, but it doesn\u2019t matter what I think, either.", "YWBTA. With that being said, you're not wrong. You should probably have conversations post-vacation with a pretty clear line drawn.", "ESH  \nNot allowing tampons for that reason is... weird and possibly assholish but if you buy them tampons and the mother finds out it's gonna be a shitty situation for the children.", "You wouldn\u2019t be TA, but you would absolutely be overstepping your boundaries.

I\u2019d still do it anyways in this instance. \n\nAlso your BF is a walking red flag. If you think there\u2019s not more where that came from you\u2019re super mistaken.

But honestly, if you haven't changed your tampon before the \"danger time\" being after 8 hours, you deserve to get it. \n\nAnd honestly, that is completely disgusting.

Everyone in this story sounds like a weirdo except the two teens who would probably rather if everyone leaves them be.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your business. 17 is old enough to buy (and hide) her own. You can buy them for yourself and offer them or mention they are available if anyone needs them but don't buy them for her specifically because all you will do is cause more problems and it will be very uncomfortable with the whole family disliking you while on vacation", "YTA, If you buy them for her over her mothers wishes since she is not 18.  I also recommend dumping the BF over his misogynistic views.", "Soft YTA. Your intentions are in the right place and the mother and bf are either uneducated or mysogenists, but again overstepping her mom when there is no threat to the daughter isn't your place. You might even get her in trouble if her family found out she used a tampon (I know that would have gotten me in trouble).", "YTA... you need to respect other mothers wishes. The 17 year old is also capable of buying her own tampons.. same for the 14 year old for that matter.

Only because she is a minor and her parents are still responsible for her. 18+ I would say NTA, because it's her choice.\n\nI also have conservative parents and I also asked my friends for tampons when I was like 19, and they gave me, so I am all for helping a girl out, but I would never buy tampons for a minor that isn't my child.", "YWBTA.

Absent their parents actively abusing them in some way, you have no right to inject yourself into their relationship. \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t actually have any idea why mom doesn\u2019t want to buy them; you seem to believe they\u2019re a bunch of backwards bigots, and you\u2019re assuming her motivations.

Normally we stay at the lake, but this year we're staying at an air bnb with a pool.\n\nThe first few days, his little cousin (14F) wasn't getting in the water. I asked her why, she let me know it was her \"time of month.\" I asked if she uses tampons, she said no, she doesn't like them as they are uncomfortable. I left the topic alone and just tried to console her. \n\nA few days later, she's in the water, but her older sister (17F) is not. \n\nHer(17F) boyfriend, who's also 17, is staying here with us, and he's playing with the kids in the water while she sits out with the dog. \n\nI asked her the same thing, was she going to get in the water today? She said no, it's also now her time of month. I said if she liked to use tampons, she said she doesn't mind them but her mom doesn't want to buy them for her (for what I assume are misogynistic reasons, bf's family is very very traditional.)\n\nI got kind of upset and told her that I would buy some for her tomorrow (today) and keep them in my room if she needed any. I mentioned in to my BF later on and said I thought it was weird that her mom prevented her from using tampons. \n\nHe told me I should definitely NOT buy any for her as that would not only overstep her mother (which I understand) but also \"send the wrong message.\" I asked him what he meant, and he starts spewing out misogynistic nonsense.\n\nBasically his points were \"she shouldn't be putting anything up there,\" so I reminded him that tampons are sanitary and non-sexual, and that since it's a pool vacation she will miss out. He said it's about \"protection\" which really pissed me off. I mean the girl is 17 years old, a senior in high school, her boyfriend is literally here with us, (Like newsflash???) \n\nHe was very respectful about it and said it was just his opinion, but I'm still upset over this ideology. That's not the point of the post though.\n\nWIBTA if I bought my BF's little cousin tampons today so that she can get in the pool water??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In my opinion, the only part where OP might be crossing the line, is that these are cousins - not siblings; or how long they've known the family members - like if it was her first time on this family vacation - or they've been together for 3-4 of these trips.", "Yeah but we men are dumb and sometimes need to just hear it. I had never heard of planned parenthood growing up in a small town. It might be common knowledge to some but\u2026", "I mean if she values the relationship, she should at least try.

If he\u2019s just ignorant, then it\u2019s a bit concerning how little he\u2019s learned about the female reproductive system as a man in his mid twenties. Is he afraid to learn? Doesn\u2019t care? What\u2019s behind it?", "I think it depends on the reason. I've been married for 21 years, and my husband is still weirded out by tampons, not that he thinks they are sexual- he gets grossed out by periods- its stupid,  but not a reason to divorce him. He doesn't object to me buying them for or teenage daughters, but he would probably die of embarrassment if he had to buy the. Again, stupid,  but a small thing in the scheme of things.

If she was still alive, I'd bring that up. \ud83e\udd23", "Absolutely not, I went to a Catholic school so I was as misinformed as you. First of all, virginity is a ridiculous concept with no clear lines. Most people mean that the hymen is intact. This is also misinformed because (as I also wasn't taught) the hymen can break for many reasons that have nothing to do with sex, and will often be broken before the first penetration. Horse riding, gymnastics, or any strenuous exercise can cause it to break. If tampons hurt to insert or remove you are using a size that is too large, just size down and you should be fine. Some people find them uncomfortable and that's a totally fine reason not to use them. I recommend the channel MommaDoctorJones, she's a board certified gynacologist and that's where I learned the majority of what Catholic school didn't teach me. The channel is a safe space for all genders. I hope this helps!", "No, there is no physiological difference between a female virgin and a virgout (someone who is not a virgin)\n\nThe hymen is does not cover the opening of the vagina, and is not automatically broken by sex. Think about it, if the hymen covered the vagina how would the blood get out?\n\nA healthy hymen is shaped like a donut, and while certain activities, like PIV sex can damage it, it can repair itself to a large extent. Sex will not automatically harm the hymen, if the woman is properly prepared.\n\nTampons are unlikely to damage the hymen, because they are too small and women insert them gently. \n\nUncommonly the hymen does develop such that is a barrier. Surgery is needed to treat the problem, as it can cause severe infection. (They cut a hole in the hymen, nbd).", "No", "That\u2019s not the case for everyone.

She\u2019s not a \u201ctampon pushing weirdo\u201d for trying to make sure the girls enjoyed their vacation WITH A POOL!

Idk what's wrong with girls supporting girls.", "I mean it's a question girly. Again she was being helpful.

Speaking as a woman, a 54-year-old woman at that, asking if they wanted to use tampons so to enjoy the pool is not only *not* weird or creepy, it's extremely reasonable.

At 17, I'd have been more likely to ask her directly but definitely wouldn't have blinked at the question. I'm sorry you see women helping women, girls helping girls, and - yes - women helping girls as something creepy and weird because it's not. At all.", "Dude trust me, if they're not buying then for her, she's definitely not gonna tell her parents OP helped her out.", "So you believe that because the 17 year old wants to use them, but mentioned her mom won\u2019t buy them for her, she should not be given that option?

Or if the parents were vegetarians, should you not offer a 17 year old a meal with meat? 14 is trickier, because if they go against their parents it could get them in trouble and you have caused that, but at 17 they're old enough to decide to go against their parents beliefs when it comes to their own bodies.", "No she said she doesn't mind them but mother dearest won't let her.

That's a weird thing to say.", "Yes, you absolutely can, especially when the parents are idiots.", "Of course you can. The parent might be mad, but who cares? Anyone can tell a child about things that exist in the world. Ideally, of course, it would be age appropriate. But tampons for teenagers is totally appropriate.

It\u2019s up to the kid if they want to obey the parents. But to purchase an item for a kid after their parents said they cannot have it, is overstepping a boundary.

Even if the other person STRONGLY, DEEPLY disagreed with my parenting, they still wouldn\u2019t have a right to intervene. Even if they thought that me providing my child with puberty blockers was harmful to my child, they would STILL be overstepping a boundary by undermining me as a parent. This is the same.
