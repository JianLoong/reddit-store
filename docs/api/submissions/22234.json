{"id": 22234, "submission_id": "14zla5k", "title": "WIBTA if I bought tampons for a teenager?", "selftext": "I'm 24F on a yearly, ten-day long vacation with my BF(24M) and his family. Normally we stay at the lake, but this year we're staying at an air bnb with a pool.\n\nThe first few days, his little cousin (14F) wasn't getting in the water. I asked her why, she let me know it was her \"time of month.\" I asked if she uses tampons, she said no, she doesn't like them as they are uncomfortable. I left the topic alone and just tried to console her. \n\nA few days later, she's in the water, but her older sister (17F) is not. \n\nHer(17F) boyfriend, who's also 17, is staying here with us, and he's playing with the kids in the water while she sits out with the dog. \n\nI asked her the same thing, was she going to get in the water today? She said no, it's also now her time of month. I said if she liked to use tampons, she said she doesn't mind them but her mom doesn't want to buy them for her (for what I assume are misogynistic reasons, bf's family is very very traditional.)\n\nI got kind of upset and told her that I would buy some for her tomorrow (today) and keep them in my room if she needed any. I mentioned in to my BF later on and said I thought it was weird that her mom prevented her from using tampons. \n\nHe told me I should definitely NOT buy any for her as that would not only overstep her mother (which I understand) but also \"send the wrong message.\" I asked him what he meant, and he starts spewing out misogynistic nonsense.\n\nBasically his points were \"she shouldn't be putting anything up there,\" so I reminded him that tampons are sanitary and non-sexual, and that since it's a pool vacation she will miss out. He said it's about \"protection\" which really pissed me off. I mean the girl is 17 years old, a senior in high school, her boyfriend is literally here with us, (Like newsflash???) \n\nHe was very respectful about it and said it was just his opinion, but I'm still upset over this ideology. That's not the point of the post though.\n\nWIBTA if I bought my BF's little cousin tampons today so that she can get in the pool water??\n\n\nINFO:\n-The mother of the girls is bf's aunt, not\nhis mother\n\n-I've been with bf and his family for nearly 6 years\n\n-We are staying in a remote location, she wouldn't be able to purchase anything without the help of an adult with a car\n\n-She didn't express that she wanted a tampon, I offered and she said thank you, but did seem generally indifferent\n\n-She does have an older sister (our age) who could have helped her and I'm not sure why she didn't ask\n\n-I'm only assuming that this is the reason her mother won't let her use them, I should get a clear reason from her mother but am afraid it will create tension\n\n\n***UPDATE!!!!!!!***\nThanks for the awards!! I've thoroughly enjoyed reading all the comments and hearing some other opinions. \n\nThank you for the people who offered alternative solutions, like a menstrual cup or period underwear, it's just not feasible given our location for the trip. And thank you for those who urged me to talk to BF. We had a long conversation about this and I showed him the post and comments. He admitted that it may not have been his place and that he could change his opinion over time, but for now still holds that I shouldn't overstep the aunt.\n\nI'll continue to pry deeper into his ideologies that have recently been popping up and see if he's willing to learn more about women and sexism. \n\nIt was also admittedly wrong of me to jump to conclusions regarding her mom's perspective, as someone also mentioned that it could be another concern, like money, high risk of TSS, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, due to all of this period talk, I have started my cycle as well (great) and have purchased tampons that are wholly and intentionally just for me. \n\nTaking all of the comments and opinions to heart, \nI'll see if she's swimming again the next time. (We didn't end up using the pool today) And I will just mention again that I have some tampons in my room if she needs some, and leave it at that and nothing more. I can't just leave it in the open in the bathroom as period products \"make the men uncomfortable.\" \n\nI'll also talk to her older sister about it, who I'm decently close to and find out what's going on regarding that. She has much more say-so than I in the girls life and would be able to make a better decision. \n\nBut it's the best solution I can come up with without overstepping boundaries, just offering it, and keeping it accessible, instead of forcing it on her.", "created_utc": 1689352781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zla5k/wibta_if_i_bought_tampons_for_a_teenager/", "score": 2811, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would you ever want your potential future children to be with a man who thinks tampons or not OK? I wouldn\u2019t buy them NTA.", "NTA - beyond how archaic the ideology they consume is - you didn't give them to her, you told her that you'd get some and keep them in your room if she wanted any. You made her an offer that she can take up or refuse and didn't force it on her. If you had given her the box and insisted she use them then maybe I'd see where an issue could arise, but there's nothing wrong with empowering her to have the option.\n\nAlso, jfc why do people still believe in this bs?", "YWNBTA for buying her tampons.\n\nHowever if you stay with someone who actually believes that kind of ignorant misogynistic nonsense, you would be.", "NTA.\n\nI had a similar experience as a young teenager where my grandmother said tampons were for married women only. Such a ridiculous opinion to have and my cousin bought some for me because it\u2019s what I preferred to use at 15. Tampons do not take away your virginity. If a girl wants to use it she should be able to! Her parents\u2019 lack of education is sad.", "You really wana be in a relationship with a perso. Who sexualizes inserting a tampon? \n\nGirl, No. NTA\n\nBut id buy her some low key, dont say anything else about it to anyone. Enjoy whats left of the vacation, go home and dump this boy.", "NTA. Like you said, it's for sanitary purposes. Your bf and his family are making it sexual for no reason. After this vacation, I'd take a long good look at who you're with. If you guys end up getting married, he'll do the same to your daughter (if you have kids)", "NTA you are not forcing her to use them you are just telling her where to find them if she wants them. But \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9on the BF", "NTA\n\nAlthough if you're in a place where there's a nearby shop that she could purchase her own tampons, you could simply hand her a $20 and have her go get them herself.\n\nThis all just bewilders me because by 17 I was buying my own supplies anyhow. My mom had NO input and I would have been creeped out if she'd tried to have input.", "There is such a fucked up and creepy need some people feel to \u201cprotect\u201d a girls vagina. It\u2019s nauseating. Prohibiting her from using tampons at 17 years old is outrageous. You\u2019re NTA, but I\u2019d buy them for myself and offer one for pool time.", "NTA. \n\nHer bf is literally there with them??? What do they expect is going on with her and the bf. Their reason of the tampon giving a sexual stimulation is just thrown out the window logically since the bf is there. \n\nThat logic and ideology is so so disgusting. I would consider leaving him simply because that\u2019s not someone I\u2019d wanna deal with or be around that type of family long term. They sound like they\u2019d be horrible in laws.", "Nta. Uhh your boyfriend is a misogynist.", "NTA - you did a nice thing for the girls, but please stop and take a long hard look at your relationship.  That's great that your BF was very respectful while spewing his misogynistic nonsense, but this is how he will be with any children you have.  If you stay with this man and have children with him, he will not allow his daughters to use tampons in order to protect them.  And honestly, it makes me wonder if he's judging you for using them as well.\n\nI mean, lord only knows what other deep-seated idiotic ideas he's hiding from you.", "NTA. Some of these people in the comments are insane. It\u2019s a tampon - it\u2019s not her mum\u2019s right to ban them. She\u2019s not buying them probably in fear he mum finds them, but OP is offering to keep them on her person and since it\u2019s a shared house, OP would also probably take the blame for any in the washroom bin should the mum be insane enough to see one and start bringing in the priests so she can be wed to the tampon that took her innocence. \n\nPlus considering 17F said she doesn\u2019t mind them, I\u2019m gonna bet she\u2019s probably used one already. Borrowed from friends most likely.", "You\u2019re wrong about one thing. The ideology IS the point of the post. This family (and I am including your partner) is fully of misogyny and simply inaccurate positions pertaining to women\u2019s health.

Certainly before you have a child that will be raised in that circle.", "NTA if you just buy them and leave them in your room for her to make a choice. Minor or not, I strongly believe that 17 is old enough for a person to make their own choices concerning menstrual hygiene. Who would even know?\n\nIf you and BF are sexually active then you should consider your future based on what he told you. Because at best might be a hypocrite, at worst he just told you what he thinks your value is.", "NTA. People who think tampons are sexual in any way need to get over themselves.

Parents' preferences are unimportant when it comes to what kind of sanitary products their kid uses, especially when it's restricting their daily activities. \n\nI refuse to wear tampons personally, but that's out of choice as I find them uncomfortable.

I would be reevaluating that decision after this is done.", "NTA.  At least BF is \"respectful\" in his backwards views and being clueless?  OP, be thankful for this insight into how he views women in general, any potential children, and perhaps you as well.", "NTA.  As to your bf's opinion - why is he weighing in on something that's none of his business?  He needed a heads-up in case she stopped by the room, but he should not be talking about his sisters' private parts.", "Nta but does anyone else find it weird that the parents won't buy tampons for a 17 YO but they bring her BF on a 10 day trip?  That seems....odd.", "NTA. Run from this dude. It's not traditional. How can it be traditional when tampons are a relatively new invention? It's misogyny straight up. It's only religious if the family ALSO wouldn't let a male gynecologist examine her. Such a crazy idea from ignorance, borne now by assholes' wings. \n\nAs far as the girl. You already told her uncle, who agrees with the parents. There will be drama for the girl. Since you aren't inserting it yourself, I can't see how you would get in trouble. Also, maybe it would give her some confidence that this is messed UP.", "NTA for buying menstrual products for people that need/want them. Definitely not cool staying with a misogynist who spews deeply ignorant and harmful bullshit no matter how respectfully he does it.", "The concept that a period and tampons is sexual is misogynistic and outdated. All women have periods and use sanitary products. It\u2019s completely ridiculous to associate using a tampon with intercourse. Your bf and his family are living in the dark ages and you may want to find someone in 2023. Huge red flag for you!!!!", "Where tf do you live where people are so sexist they don\u2019t allow tampons ??? Lmao", "NTA, but be prepared for a lot of BS if these backwards people find out about it. My biggest concern is how they will treat this poor girl if they find out. Are they going to start making wild assumptions she\u2019s sexually promiscuous or shame her? If I were you I would buy them and then pretend to be on my period myself if anyone asked (if box/wrappers were found in garbage bin etc). That would require your bf being ok with keeping up that lie though. He sounds very misogynistic and likely to start a huge argument with you about it even if his family never finds out. Personally this would be a HUGE red flag to me and I wouldn\u2019t want to date someone with these views or be forced to vacation with people like this.", "NTA\n\nProviding teenagers with appropriate menstrual\nsupplies and educating them on how their bodies work is actually associated with higher self esteem and increased bodily autonomy as an adult.\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to admit that you\u2019re the one who got her tampons. There are also ways they can be discreetly hidden in things like make up bags or pencil pouches. Her family doesn\u2019t even have to know. Just make sure that she knows that she needs to remove them frequently, to avoid touching the tip before inserting them, and to wash her hands before and after use. \n\nI think one of the nicest things someone has ever done for me in high school is lend me a tampon when my period came early. There\u2019s so much shame surrounding that as a teenager. Trust me, you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "WTF with everything I just read...\n\nYour boyfriends family sucks. \n\nYou are NTA", "NTA let the girl enjoy her vacation and you may need to have some serious convos with bf soon", "NTA\u2026but run girl!

Please consider if you want to continue a relationship with a misogynistic AH who doesn't understand basic female anatomy. His entire family sounds disgusting and I pity his sisters.", "Him saying \"it's about protection\" and making it sexual really feels like he's saying \"protection of her virginity\" or maybe even her hymen (yes I know that's not all girls and gets torn my a million things but he definitely doesn't think that way), and that using a tampon or inserting anything might equate to no longer being a \"true virgin\" or some backwards, misogynistic garbage. Get the tampons for the poor girl and GTFO of the relationship if anyone objects, you are NTA for explaining women's bodies and looking after this kid.", "Aaaaand this is why people's opinions need to stop being presented as facts.\n\nCos people, more often than not, are wrong.\n\nNTA.\n\nBuy the tampons, applicator variety, few different sizes if possible, and let them both know if they have questions about how to use them.\n\nPeriods are crap, and absolutely something we should not be kowtowing to in 2023 because of outdated ideas over tampons. They should be enjoying the holiday too.\n\nSounds like they've grown up hearing negative shit about tampons so it might take a while to undo that damage.", "Op as a 45 year old male.

This might be a good alternative?", "NTA - I\u2019d tread carefully for her sake, she\u2019d be the one that will get the backlash if the family find out.

I cannot BELIEVE people are against this!!! **TAMPONS DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO YOUR BODY THAT COULDNT ALREADY HAPPEN NATURALLY.** I cannot seriously fathom this logic. I cannot fathom anyone forcing their daughter to sit in diapers for a week every month because theyre not *allowed* to use a significantly cleaner methodology.\n\nIMO? Buy her tampons and dumb his useless rear end behind. This kind of way beyond prude behavior makes me feel like youre all raising nuns. \n\nI seriously. Cannot believe. Her family is sexualizing tampons. At 17. Omfg", "NTA. I was raised with these beliefs that in my case were cultural miseducation because I\u2019m a first gen American. I didn\u2019t wear tampons until I was 22 because no one had ever taught me to wear them and I was terrified of hurting myself because of my lack of education about it. 17 is old enough to know what kind of sanitary items she prefers and make decisions about it without input from parents. \n\nI do agree you\u2019re going to have sit down with the boyfriend after this trip and see if you can educate him directly or if this is a lost cause. If it is a lost cause, ask yourself if you want to have this argument with him in 10-15 years about your own potential daughters if you want children.", "NTA,  people need to get over it.

What if she asks you for one and you broke your promise? All you told her was you were buying tampons and she can ask for them. You\u2019re just buying tampons not forcing her to use them.

Seems to work great so far. \n\nThat said, nta, and your boyfriends opinion has absolutely, like below zero, no weight here. A 17 year old is old enough to go out and buy them on her own if she even wanted, let alone to take then from a family member.\n\nEta, because AITA is insane, this isn't a reason to dump your boyfriend.

His opinion is bigoted and wrong, but I've met COUNTLESS of people who share the same idea. It comes from a place of ignorance, usually learned from parents/other authority figures.

Normally we stay at the lake, but this year we're staying at an air bnb with a pool.\n\nThe first few days, his little cousin (14F) wasn't getting in the water. I asked her why, she let me know it was her \"time of month.\" I asked if she uses tampons, she said no, she doesn't like them as they are uncomfortable. I left the topic alone and just tried to console her. \n\nA few days later, she's in the water, but her older sister (17F) is not. \n\nHer(17F) boyfriend, who's also 17, is staying here with us, and he's playing with the kids in the water while she sits out with the dog. \n\nI asked her the same thing, was she going to get in the water today? She said no, it's also now her time of month. I said if she liked to use tampons, she said she doesn't mind them but her mom doesn't want to buy them for her (for what I assume are misogynistic reasons, bf's family is very very traditional.)\n\nI got kind of upset and told her that I would buy some for her tomorrow (today) and keep them in my room if she needed any. I mentioned in to my BF later on and said I thought it was weird that her mom prevented her from using tampons. \n\nHe told me I should definitely NOT buy any for her as that would not only overstep her mother (which I understand) but also \"send the wrong message.\" I asked him what he meant, and he starts spewing out misogynistic nonsense.\n\nBasically his points were \"she shouldn't be putting anything up there,\" so I reminded him that tampons are sanitary and non-sexual, and that since it's a pool vacation she will miss out. He said it's about \"protection\" which really pissed me off. I mean the girl is 17 years old, a senior in high school, her boyfriend is literally here with us, (Like newsflash???) \n\nHe was very respectful about it and said it was just his opinion, but I'm still upset over this ideology. That's not the point of the post though.\n\nWIBTA if I bought my BF's little cousin tampons today so that she can get in the pool water??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
