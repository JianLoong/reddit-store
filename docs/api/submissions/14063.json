Here is my go to script when other people want to use my money or resources.\n\nGC to mom, dad, older sisters, brother, and niece:\n\nSorry, I am an asshole for not letting brother and niece move in with me.  I'm working on that with my therapist/priest/rabbi/shaman (pick one).  My therapist/priest/rabbi/shaman says I'm making progress but an not all the way there.\n\nMom and Dad, I think that brother is lucky to have you two as parents and is lucky that you two are moving into your own apartment/house where brother can move in with you.  I'm sure that the three of you will be happy together and will pool your money together to make this possible.  This kind of behavior is positive reinforcement for me.  \n\nDear sister #1.  I can only be awed by your grace in letting brother and niece move in with you until mom and dad can find a place where all of them can live.  I'm sure that having brother and niece living with you is the exact example you want to show me.  \n\nDear sister #2, just like dear sister #1 your grace in this matter is the example and the guiding light that I need.  It is so helpful that you have agreed to help with a monthly stipend for brother so that he can care for our niece.  \n\nDear Brother and Niece, as you can see with the exception of me, because I'm still somewhat of an asshole, all of the family is helping and stepping up to help both of your lives better.  I will be sharing all of this with my therapist/priest/rabbi/shaman as example's of how I want to be when I grow up. \n\nAgain, I am a lucky man to have you all as family and shining examples.", "Never give him the option of staying, make that clear and to stop bringing this conversation up.", "Of course the sisters want the brother to live with OP -- otherwise he'd try to move in with them.", "I'm actually having surgery in a couple weeks, so I've been preparing for that. Nobody believed I was having issues until the surgery became a certainty.", "If he won't even pay $350 for a house he just wants to mooch off you & I'm guessing use your parents for child care.
