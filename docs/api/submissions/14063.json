Just try it!), and they will depend on you for EVERYTHING. I\u2019m a nurse, I\u2019ve seen it SO many times when parents move in with kids. Siblings are the worst in these situations. Whatever you do, I wish you the best, but I sure hope you stand your ground because you just have no idea how bad this could get for you overnight.", "Why don\u2019t your older sisters let him move in with them if they\u2019re that concerned about his living arrangements. Oh, I forgot, then he would be their problem and not your problem. Stand firm and don\u2019t let him move in.", "NTA for not letting him move. Siblings are probably giving you grief because they don't want him living with them so need to make sure he is set up elsewhere. Hold firm and do not let him move in.", "Your siblings don\u2019t love him more, they just don\u2019t want to deal with him either, which is why they are trying to guilt you into doing it. NTA.", "Stand your ground.  If you let him in, he will be out of a job in just a few months.  You will be the one raising his kid.  If your parents keep nagging you tell them they might want to move in with him to help out.  If your sister keeps nagging you tell her that she is more than welcome to let him move in with her or pay his rent.", "**NTA no, absolutely the fuck not**.\n\nThat you even question it shows how manipulative they\u2019ve all been. **I\u2019m sure you know this by now but let me remind you, if you let him move him he will never move out. Not only because he\u2019ll somehow never have the money to move back out, but because of the manipulation. What you\u2019re dealing with now your deal with 10 fold when you tried to kick him out**. As of now he knows he\u2019s doesn\u2019t have ownership of your home but he feels entitled (already a huge fucking problem). Once he moves in and stays for awhile he\u2019s no longer going to see it as your home but as \u201chis home\u201d or \u201cthe family home\u201d once that happens his entitlement will become uncontrollable. Call the cops to evict him uncontrollable, and if you think your family thinks your TA for not letting him move in, think of what they\u2019ll call you once they consider it his home too and you have to remove him by force. You need to have a frank conversation with your parents no matter how uncomfortable that may be for you, I\u2019m willing to bet they\u2019re a big part of the reason for this. I also want to preface what I\u2019m about to say by saying you absolutely don\u2019t have to mean this but you without a doubt need to say it. \n\n**Remind them that this is your home, that you\u2019re doing them a favor by letting them live with you because you love them but that they have zero say over how your home is handled and whom is allowed inside. That if they refuse to respect you and your wishes that they\u2019re free to move out and live with your brother themselves but that hell will freeze over before you contribute to their enablement of your brother let alone enable him yourself**. That you feel bad for his daughter sure but that she is not your responsibility and that you refuse to be coerced into believing that your brother and his daughter are your responsibility to take care of. They\u2019ll probably eventually say \u201cbut he\u2019s your brother\u201d \u201cfamily takes care of family\u201d remind them that, family taking care of family does not equal financially sponsoring family. It means babysitting on occasion, and driving each other to doctors appointments etc. Now your sisters - and this one might be tough for you as well but the next time they bring it up tell them you refuse to discuss the issue further, that you refuse to change your mind and that any further manipulation will result in you ending the phone call and going low/no contact with them (again you don\u2019t have to mean it, but you need to say it so they know that they\u2019re manipulations will not only not work but will negatively affect their relationship with you). **Your sisters also don\u2019t have room to speak when it\u2019s not them that would be sacrificing their home, income, and sanity. It\u2019s easy to be generous with other peoples things and money, he\u2019ll I\u2019d actually tell them if they bring it up to you again you\u2019ll tell your brother they said he\u2019d be welcome in their home** and watch them shut up.\n\nThey also probably know that if they can\u2019t convince you, your parents will probably move onto manipulating them and they\u2019d rather it be your issue which goes to show they don\u2019t believe a word they actually say to you. **You\u2019re gonna have to grow a spine and become okay with them thinking you\u2019re being a dick. You\u2019re not, I know you\u2019re not, this entire thread knows you\u2019re not, and even they know you\u2019re not. Thing is when someone wants something from you so bad they\u2019ll do or say anything to get it. From false promises \u201cI\u2019ll pay x or do y if you do z\u201d, to insults of character \u201chow could you be so selfish\u201d, \u201cyou really don\u2019t care about anyone but yourself\u201d, \u201cwhen did you become such an insensitive asshole\u201d etc. They don\u2019t believe any of it despite what they\u2019ll tell you. Thing is when people are in those situations they say anything they can hoping it\u2019ll stick. That they hit your pride just hard enough, you\u2019ll fall on your knees apologizing trying to convince them you\u2019re not what they\u2019re claiming: until you give in to their demand**. As far as your brother just grey rock him, don\u2019t let him get a rise out of you just say \u201cI already said no\u201d \u201cthis isn\u2019t up for discussion\u201d \u201cyou can either drop it or I\u2019m hanging up\u201d \u201cif you bring it up one more time I\u2019ll be forced to block you\u201d and if he keeps going, follow through.  \n\nETA **Your parents will probably be the hardest for you because I\u2019m sure you love and respect them, they wouldn\u2019t be in your home otherwise. But they clearly have no respect for you so you have to have some for yourself**. They coddled your brother and that was their mistake, it\u2019s not on you to pick up where they left off. Also If you do, he will never learn to be self sufficient because he\u2019s always going to assume someone will bail him out to make his life easier. As of now he\u2019s having to bust his ass to provide for his daughter, if you\u2019re the one providing her with a bed to sleep and food to eat his motivation is gone. If he doesn\u2019t learn now he never will.", "NTA", "NTA. He wants free rent and free childcare. Mark my words, you and your parents will suddenly be the only ones taking care of his daughter if he moves in.", "Or they can take your parents and then your mom will invite him to live in their house too.", "Came here to say this.\n\nI'd tell them how wildly inappropriate it was to tell the brother he could move in without consulting OP, and remind them even moreso since he has demonstrable issues with being responsible and making good choices.\n\nI'd also let them know if they so much as SUGGEST he moves in one more time, they can start looking for their own place (and then yay, OP's brother can have roommates)!", ">remind them even moreso since he has demonstrable issues with being responsible and making good choices.\n\nDon't even, \"You know how your brother is! He just needs time to sort himself out and a bit of help from family! We should be helping out so he can get on his feet!\"", "Can you imagine getting a house for 350 a month and having your parents get you TWO jobs and STILL being unable to act like an adult? Wtf"]}
