The noise was louder than anticipated and if they idled for more than a few minutes I could smell the exhaust. So...it depends? If the apartment was an add-on and they cut corners, it could be unpleasant. This would be the landlord's fault though, not yours.\n\nAt the end of the day, they knew they were risking this exact issue when they chose an above-garage rental without checking out what happens when someone uses the garage. It isn't your fault and you're NTA.\n\nBut if you want to compromise, it would be reasonable to start your car/bike in the garage and then back it onto the driveway to warm up.\n\nETA PSA: you know this isn't safe for YOU, right? Letting your car idle in an open garage for several minutes is an unsafe practice as it can still risk carbon monoxide buildup towards the front of the garage.", "It says that's your assigned spot?\n\nI'm torn.
