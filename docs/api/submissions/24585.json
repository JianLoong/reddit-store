I was obviously in heaven, and he went because I wanted to go. When we got to the \"cheese fudge\" (no, idk what that means, but it was tasty), he ate a sample before I could tell him what it was. He told me how much he enjoyed it, and I verified multiple times that he meant it. Then I told him.

I can't eat pizza other people ordered which has cheese on it at all.", "Omg I love Gordon Ramsey I really should\u2019ve looked that up", "Well, let's put it this way.\n\nYou know that some people in the world eat foods that in *your* culture are not eaten, right? For example, if you're an American you probably don't eat crickets or guinea pigs or horses, but you know that *other* people eat those things. And if you're not Jewish or Muslim (or vegetarian!) you probably eat pork, but you're aware that some people don't eat pork, yes?\n\nSo let's imagine that I give you a smoothie and I don't tell you that my secret ingredient is cricket powder. I actually *would* tell you that, but let's say that for whatever reason I just didn't think of it. Perhaps later, when I tell you that your smoothie was made *with bugs* you'll feel a little sick. Bugs aren't food! They're vermin! You were okay with it when you ate the food, but you're not okay with it anymore. Or maybe you went a Peruvian restaurant, you're not familiar with the cuisine, and you didn't realize that the food you ordered was made of guinea pig. You think it tastes good, it's all fine - but when you look up the recipe later you find out it was made with a guinea pig! And you feel a little sick at the idea that you ate a *pet* and thought it was *meat*.\n\nYour aversion is *cultural*. You've slotted some things into the 'food' category based on what your *culture* says is and is not food, and you probably don't really think too much about it. It's just ordinary, everyday.\n\nBut another person's aversion might be just as valid even if it's kinda random instead of cultural.", "aw somebody's feelings got hurt.\n\nyou're so full of shit. you make me laugh.", "Left beef none pizza.", "such great and selfless friends you have, willing to sacrifice themselves to rid you of your cheese.\n\nIf you need one more to help make things more bearable with this disgusting burden  just let me know.", "here's a thought: it's not up to you or OP or anyone else to decide what a person should or shouldn't eat. if someone doesn't want to eat something, for WHATEVER reason, why would you stand by and silently watch them eat something you prepared that has that ingredient?!"]}
