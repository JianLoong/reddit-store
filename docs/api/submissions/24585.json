They just gave up before they found them.\n\nI used to be married to a guy who, as a young child, decided he no longer liked cheese. Of any type. At all.

I was obviously in heaven, and he went because I wanted to go. When we got to the \"cheese fudge\" (no, idk what that means, but it was tasty), he ate a sample before I could tell him what it was. He told me how much he enjoyed it, and I verified multiple times that he meant it. Then I told him. His reply? \"Oh, I was just being polite.\" Dude...\n\nDisliking cheese had literally become his sole distinguishing personality trait by that point, so he couldn't possibly fathom that part of his identity being threatened.
