I was obviously in heaven, and he went because I wanted to go. When we got to the \"cheese fudge\" (no, idk what that means, but it was tasty), he ate a sample before I could tell him what it was. He told me how much he enjoyed it, and I verified multiple times that he meant it. Then I told him.

They literally said that. \n\nSome people are just irrational about this issue. Like it's perfectly fine to say it's rude, or unsafe if you don't know it's an allergy.

If your mom didn\u2019t make the food, and if her aversion to cheese is that big of a deal to her, she should have asked the chef (you) if there was cheese in it before taking some. On the other hand, you may not have directly given the meal to your mom but again, if her aversion to cheese is that big of a deal, you should have told her there was cheese in it when you walked in on her having some. I think people are getting hung up on the fact that \u201cit\u2019s just cheese\u201d and \u201cshe enjoyed the dish\u201d so it doesn\u2019t matter. Another comment mentioned cooking something with ground up cat (which made me very disturbed), but it did sway my opinion. If you were a vegetarian because you had an aversion towards eating animals and you started to eat a dish that you didn\u2019t realize had meat in it, wouldn\u2019t you be upset if the person who cooked it didn\u2019t tell you there was meat in it when they saw you eating it? It wouldn\u2019t matter if you were enjoying it, you still would want to be told so that you could immediately stop eating it. If you then found out a few days later that you ate meat, it\u2019s not unreasonable for you to become nauseous at the thought of having had eaten an animal.", "Drama queen!

Raving at how  delicious the sauce was.  About 3/4 of the way through the 2nd, I noticed my mom had a huge grin.\nSo I ask \"what?\".
