Clarify that you don't think their basic, but just that your fiance, and yourself do not feel the need to have these traditional things.

It\u2019s also okay to explain your reasoning behind not following certain traditions, particularly when pushed.

Small etc.) different they've all felt very the same to me since it's, get married, then have a party. I agree with you there even though you worded it terribly to them.\n\nHowever a wedding is more than that. It brings people together literally to celebrate you coming together and that is important to those who feel close to the couple. You're bringing important people from your past who may never see each other again to celebrate your future.\n\nSo maybe give yourself credit for not being basic yourself and do something creative or different if you want.

It's a part of my identity and I think getting married is a flimsy excuse for changing it, esp. since I don't necessarily see marriage as any sort of achievement that would warrant a big change like that.
