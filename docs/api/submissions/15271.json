Sounds like they badgered you into that answer by not accepting your more diplomatic/polite answers- they kinda left you no choice :P \nI don't do parties, don't really see the appeal, and I can imagine being pestered about this to a point where I'd just be like \"yes, I would rather sit at home than spend my free time with y'all, all parties are basically the same anyways\" and sure, my friends could interpret that as me calling them boring and poor party planners when it was really about any and all parties.

You told them more than once you weren't interested.\n\nHere is the deal, they were LOOKING for something to be offended about. Sounds like they all want the wedding and the ring and they kept pushing you b/c they wanted to know why you were rejecting what they wanted. They wanted to be able to argue that what they wanted is what everyone wants and there is something wrong with you and that you are judging them. They were never going to accept that your rejection of these things wasn't a judgement on them, espically due to the large expense of the decisions involved here.\n\nThere wasn't an answer here that wasn't going to lead to them confirming their suspicions that you are judging them. \n\nI know this b/c I didn't want an engement ring or public wedding, and I wanted absolutely nothing to do w/ the white dress. Most of my friends 100% understood, but when the subject came up w/ family, co-workers or acquaintances, if Inavoided an answer, they would press and when I gave an answer, no matter what I said, no matter how I phrased it, no matter how much I made my answer \"about me and what I'm comfortable with\", so many were really personally offended.\n\nI even had a boyfriend who was offended b/c I didn't want a big engagement ring. He made decent money and wanted to be able to show it off and thought his friend's and co-workers would look down on him if I wasn't sporting a huge diamond. It was so bizzare and completely unexpected.\n\nSo yeah, they were not offended b/c \"you called them basic\", they were offended before that and were just looking for a hook to hang they could hang their feelings on.", "ESH\n\nYour friends need to be more understanding about why you don't want a wedding.  I can certainly relate, if I get married again I definitely do not want a traditional wedding. But your friends need to understand that personal preferences are exactly that - personal. Weddings aren't your thing. Just like anything else that others might find really engaging or exciting that someone else just doesn't enjoy.\n\nHowever, your calling their weddings \"basic\" and \"identical\" was definitely an insult to them. Not because ooooh how dare you say they were basic but because although weddings are not a big thing to YOU, they were big deals to THEM. A lot of brides, I'm gathering your friends including, put a lot of time and effort into trying to make their weddings \"their own\". Into trying to make them memorable events. Your comment basically told them all that time and effort and pride they put into it was wasted and useless, and now their feelings are hurt.  I get that's likely not how you intended it, but just like your friends have to understand that weddings just aren't your \"thing\", you need to understand that the way you phrased your comment was hurtful to them.", "NTA.

Not being into having a wedding seems pretty normal to me anyway.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nIf you are all friends, then they should know enough about you to accept that a big ceremony isn't a thing for you. \n\nBut there was no need for you to justify your own choice by insulting theirs, and there's no way you weren't aware that was what you were doing with your \"basic\" comment.", "YTA\n\n>I personally find it all pretty basic that we all have identical weddings and wear identical rings.\n\nI get that you were talking about your own preferences, but can't you see how all the friends you're talking to who had those identical weddings wearing identical rings might feel offended by this comment?\n\nYou could've worded it a lot more diplomatically.", "NTA...They asked, and I'm sure you explained yourself.  In the same way you accept their values, they have to accept yours.", "NTA.\n\nThe questions they ask come not from a place of interest, but from a place of normalcy in society. These kinds of questions exist to reinforce standardized behavior.\n\nIt would be annoying if you brought this up every time you were faced with any conversation about anyone getting married. But as it is, you went above and beyond attempting to keep the peace.\n\nLike anything keeping the peace, only you can decide when the energy invested exceeds bothering.", "NTA because they need to realize that traditional weddings to get married aren't for everyone and are very financially taxing and stressful to prepare for and in all honesty they should be jealous of you for not dealing with all of that. A marriage is about love and there is no need for all the fanfare that is a wedding if you don't want it.", "NTA! I was you a few years ago. People were soooo annoying with their questions. Even now, I often get asked if I regret not having a \"proper\" wedding. \n\nI totally don't blame you for telling them the real reason behind your decision. At least they won't ask again!", "NTA, no apology is needed.  They are ridiculous for being upset about it.  Clarify that you don't think their basic, but just that your fiance, and yourself do not feel the need to have these traditional things.  You don't really need to justify it to anyone and I think you guys are pretty smart for saving all the cash that you would have spent on a day for everyone else to celebrate anyway!", "NTA. I agree with you and also have no desire to contribute to an oversaturated wedding economy.\n\nEveryone's wedding day is special to them personally, I understand that.

You\u2019ve answered honestly, stating that you feel that the experience special or unique enough for you to feel comfortable dropping that kind of money on it.\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to explain why you\u2019re not interested in something, even if other people are. It\u2019s also okay to explain your reasoning behind not following certain traditions, particularly when pushed. Most of all, it\u2019s okay to have different priorities to the people around you.", "NTA - they kept asking because they didn\u2019t like your answer. Well now they really don\u2019t like your answer and it is on them for continuing to push.", "NTA \nThey are mad because they didn\u2019t want a real answer, they either wanted to feel superior or convince you that their way is the way to go. \nDifferent doesn\u2019t mean better or worse it just means other and you are allowed a different opinion and different interests. Good on you for knowing what you want and being secure in yourself.", "NTA but yes you should have continued to hold your silence.   You can see why your friends are upset.", "If that was your first answer you'd be Y T A. But if they kept asking after you tried being polite,yeah they brought it on themselves.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It sounds like this is the second plus time you've had this conversation. They wouldn't accept your polite answers the first them. So this is what they got.", "ESH - They should have stopped asking when you said it just wasn't for you. That being said, you went all in with the honesty thing. You are entitled to your opinion. But even if people badgered you share that opinion, they are still allowed to take it personally and be upset by it.", "ESH A wedding is 2 people getting married and many that I've been too including my own are ridiculously expensive, and while ostensibly and even seemingly (outdoor/indoor destination, big. Small etc.) different they've all felt very the same to me since it's, get married, then have a party. I agree with you there even though you worded it terribly to them.\n\nHowever a wedding is more than that. It brings people together literally to celebrate you coming together and that is important to those who feel close to the couple. You're bringing important people from your past who may never see each other again to celebrate your future.\n\nSo maybe give yourself credit for not being basic yourself and do something creative or different if you want. Or just do nothing, but this would also mean that to them that you don't value your friends as part of your marriage.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a part of my identity and I think getting married is a flimsy excuse for changing it, esp. since I don't necessarily see marriage as any sort of achievement that would warrant a big change like that.
