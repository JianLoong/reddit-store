Because from the coworkers response, even if OP hadn't said anything when handing them the ice scraper, she knew what was expected of her with it.

It was in response to someone else.\n\nOP didn't say in their original post that they communicated with the coworker about scraping off their car, just handed a scraper to them.  It takes zero effort to say 'please'.  Communication is a necessity, even if something someone thinks something is easily 'inferred'.  People aren't mind readers.\n\nIf someone drove off without saying a thing to me, after saying they'd take me home - I'd be pissed off too.  This is why I'm not saying ESH.\n\nI also feel like there's more to this than OP is saying - and I'm trusting my gut here.\n\nI don't really care if people don't agree with me.  I still think OP was the AH for leaving their coworker and just driving off without saying a thing.", "Per OP\u2019s comments, they asked her to scrape her side and said the heater would do some of the work and OP would do the rest.
