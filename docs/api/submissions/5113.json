In my case it depends on my customers and I have 1 that, around Christmas time always has a few more orders that need to go on a night flight or early morning flight so I Monitore them as they are expensive.\n\nWell this morning we were off from work and my car was frozen. In Germany there was a warning for slippery roads etc. so I expected this.\n\nI sprayed some anti ice to make it easier but still pulled out the scrapers and gave her 1 as the spray doesn\u2019t work on thicker ice. \n\nShe was like why would I scrape ice ?it\u2019s your car! I shouldn\u2019t have to this!\nI just looked at her finished scraping the ice went into the car and drove off didn\u2019t say a word went home and slept until now 2pm \nTbh i was sooooo tired a nightshift after a weekend .. pulled an all nighter .\n\nShe blew up my phone wit messages and calls. Called me all types of mean names and claims I have to pay her taxi as she didn\u2019t prepare herself for the bus.(whatever that means )\n\nSo am I the ah?\n\n\nEdit:\nThank you all for your insight I\u2019d like to clarify some things\n\nI\u2019m 25 female\n\nI had to drive an extra 5 minutes to pick her up and another 5 to make up for that time \n\nI left her in a 24h industrial area for logistic company\u2019s which you can only enter with a card after you passed a police check (meaning you have a white west) at 7:15am i usually arrive for work at 6am if that means anything (if this indicates where I live pls don\u2019t comment it )\n\nSam has a bus card paid for by our workplace i know this because wall of us have one.\nWe are required to wear masks at work when talking to customers, drivers or general outsiders(ppl outside or company ) so I knew she had one.\nIn Germany you still have to wear a mask in the train busses etc and since her bus card is integrated in her company card which she need to clock in I believe she had everything at hand.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask her for money or anything back as a matter of fact I was once in her situation although i was underage and couldn\u2019t have a license. That bis times didn\u2019t match my off times so I\u2019d often ask if someone drive by the station or anywhere near where I lived so that I walk the rest of the way of whatever was possible. I always tried to make it as easy as possible for the person doing me a favor if that meant scrapping is that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. As a matter of fact I had always made it a habit to leave a few minutes earlier and scrap the ice before the person came when they lived close by.\nI\u2019d also try to repay the favor whether it\u2019s money a coffee or whatever. Mind you most of these were friend or close co workers so ppl I took my lunch with, drunk coffee or smoked with.\n\nSam and I aren\u2019t friends I only see her max 10 minutes in the morning for a short this is open and keep an eye on that meeting(handing over) \n\nI talked to a few coworkers and they told me to write in the GC and those of them that regularly work Night Shift said \n1. she in fact took the bus home not the taxi\n2. She did similar stuff to others ranging from not paying gas money to even coming repeatedly too late and not scrapping ice \nThey said they would have warned me had they known I\u2019d take her to work\n\nI did say something when I held the scraper to her I said: just Scrape the window on your and the tiny one behind (opel Corsa drivers will know what i mean lol) the rear window has a heater and I\u2019ll do the front and my side since I had the telescope scrapper and it just wouldn\u2019t make sense to scrap my side.\nthan she said what she said and proceeded to go on her phone while I scrapped.\n\nLast but not least yeah I should have said something in those situations I fall back into old habits aka not talking not communicating properly I usually have to make a big effort but in that moment I was too tired I hadn\u2019t slept for close to 24h which doesn\u2019t excuse my actions so thank you and I will apologize to her about not making telling her this properly but not that I left her behind idk I feel like that was my moment.", "created_utc": 1671455981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zprdyq/aita_for_not_taking_my_coworker_home_like_we/", "score": 1863, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
