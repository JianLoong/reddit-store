I've worked really hard for it, and I'm proud of what I've achieved. My cousin, let's call her Lisa, is aware of this. She's been having some car trouble lately, and her vehicle is in the shop for some major repairs.\n\nLast week, Lisa asked me if she could borrow my car for a few days while hers is getting fixed. She told me it would be a huge help for her since she's got work and other commitments to attend to. Now, normally, I'm all for helping family out, and I don't mind sharing when it's necessary.\n\nHere's where things got tricky: Lisa is a bit notorious for not treating other people's stuff very well. She's a bit reckless, and I've seen her mishandle borrowed items before. My car is my pride and joy, and I'm just not comfortable lending it to her.\n\nI told her that I'm sorry about her situation, but I couldn't lend her my car. I offered to help her find alternative transportation options like car rentals or ride-sharing apps, but she got upset with me. She said I was being selfish and that family should always help each other out no matter what.\n\nNow, my other family members are divided on this. Some are on my side, saying I should protect my investment, while others think I should've just let Lisa use the car temporarily since family should stick together.\n\nSo, AITA for not lending my car to my cousin in her time of need? Did I make a selfish choice, or was I right to protect my property?

Here's a personalized explanation of why  I could be perceived negatively:\n\nFamily Bonds: It's common for people to believe that family should support each other through challenges. Lisa reached out to me when her car was in the shop for major repairs, a situation that caused her considerable inconvenience. By declining her request, I might appear as if I prioritize my car over assisting a family member during a tough period.\n\nBalancing Priorities: While it's entirely reasonable to want to safeguard my valuable asset, it's important to consider the context. Lisa's need for my car was temporary, and her request wasn't for an extended period. Refusing without further discussion might convey that you prioritize my car's well-being over helping my cousin during a temporary hardship.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Was she in an accident, or is it just a shitty car that needs a lot of work done?\n\nRegardless, you're under no obligation to let her borrow your car. Just because you have something that someone else doesn't have, they aren't automatically entitled to use it.\n\nKnowing her history, it's not a selfish choice. It's a smart choice.

I'll also take a guess they wouldn't want to lend their car either and are hoping you take the fall.\n\nWhat are the chances those family members would be pushing your cousin to repair any damages made to your vehicle? Would family help each other out when it comes to replacing your panels after they get scratched up?
