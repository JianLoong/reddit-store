Why are you still dating someone who treats you like an ATM, not a partner?", "NTA, however I do believe this relationship can be salvaged. If you leave now without understanding your part in this mess, you will not learn from this and put yourself at risk of repeating this pattern again. I was in your shoes once. It took me a lot of learning and reading to realize that I was the main reason my husband was not working. I was so eager to please him, never asked for help, treated him like I was his mother and never said no or established my boundaries. I set up a system that worked without him having to get a job. Your words tell him that you are stressed and struggling, but your actions are telling a different story. You continue to cover for him and pay all the bills, there is food in the fridge and roof over your head. He has no incentive to grow up. Here is what I did 1) started to treat my husband like an adult and stopped telling him what to do. I stopped giving him advice he did not ask for and stopped jumping in to solve problems for him. If he complained about money or stress, I simply told him that I believed in him, and that he is smart and resilient enough to figure out his finances. \n 2) I started to say thank you and be grateful for everything he was already doing for our family. Every day I would find something to thank him for. 3) I told him that our financial situation is not working for me. Instead we opened a joined bank account and each contributed 2k a month. This money is used for mortgage, food, car and childcare.The rest of my salary went into my savings. 3) I was fully prepared to sell our house and have bills not paid if he did failed to contribute to our joined account. I wanted to see what my husband is capable of when he was responsible for half the bills. I did not know if he would step up to the plate and meet challenge head on, or if we would end up selling the house. This is the hardest part. You need to make peace with the fact that you contributed your half, and the rest is your man's responsibility. Do not cover the rent, bills, food or pay anything on top of the agreed amount. Result: my husband went from being unemployed to getting a job, then getting a much better job, then starting a successful business in addition to his main job. He took a loan out for his own business and paid it off completely in less than 6 months! I am so proud of his growth, its awesome to see him becoming more responsible. All I had to do was stop mothering him", "All I can see from your post is that you are putting in a lot of work to this relationship while he coasts along.
