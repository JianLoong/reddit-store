And it is nice to attempt helping others to eat when the calendar is busy.\n\nBut to my view, you could now be clinging to your concept.  And tunnel-visioning about it.  As a result it appears to me you are failing to apply an equity lens, failing to realistically roll out your budget, and putting your ego into play for your pizza idea.\n\nAs an initial matter, the appearance of the new social worker has altered the eating pattern.  Equity requires feeding her too, or feeding nobody.  Her protest is not first needed.  Because the eating pattern has changed, your pizza deal is now inadequate.\n\n2nd, you have commented a lot about finding money or pulling funds together.  But I would ask, is it really sound procurement?  Public bodies and schools must scrupulously avoid personal use of public funds, which is why in government work there are only very, very limited opportunities for food purchases.  In one comment you referred to a lack of \u201cnice things.\u201d  It is more, that public employees cannot personally benefit, as I have said.  \n\nOne limited opportunity could be if there was a \u201cteam building\u201d event, such as a group training for a day, and a lunchbox was included, one for everybody, with vegetarian/kosher/halal options being available.  The public benefits from a work group that functions well together, thus the expenditure is supportable.  \n\nIn your case though, I t does not sound like your pizza procurement\u2014and it is a procurement under public contracting rules\u2014is part of team building.  So I would ask, is it really appropriate to snip pennies here and there, from other budget line items, to fund your venture?\n\n3rd, you are really, really clinging to your pizza concept.  Stepping back, as we are able to do as observers, your cling really looks like ego and thinking errors to me.  I can certainly understand that helping people slake their hunger can feel like an accomplishment.  But in your cling you are failing to see outside views, which are correct views, and you are failing to see other options.  \n\nYou keep coming back to the \u201cdeep discount\u201d which you negotiated.  It feels like you cannot release yourself from the result you have achieved, because it came from your efforts.  Which, is ego.  And you are kind of crashing and burning here over ego.  Not a good look for what should be a flexible, top-level managerial view of the whole organization.\n\nThe emerging picture to me is, that you do not have a budget line item for the meal; you do not have a public purpose for the meal; and you are providing for your staff inequitably.\n\nTime to drop this venture altogether before you get into trouble with HR as to the employee, or with finance department as to the budget.\n\nAnd maybe also chill.\n\nYTA.", "And this person is in charge of educating kids, I bloody disgusting!!!!", "NAH\n\nEmployee is not entitled to free food, and she's also not entitled to special custom free food because a book from 2000 years ago told her the regular free food isn't good enough", "YTA.\n\nYou're not buying 1 pizza for 19 people, you're probably buying 5/10.

Teachers have the authority to negotiate food in their contracts. 2 years from now their contract is up they\u2019re welcome to bring this to the bargaining table. In the meantime I\u2019m trying my best with minimal funds to help out my staff and throw them a bone. No other principals have done this and based on the entitlement of this thread I see why.", "So because I want to provide a nice gesture to my staff and one person opts out I need to pay out of pocket every time? How much do you think principals make? In what other industry would we expect bosses to pay out of pocket for an employee meal?", "For some people bigotry is like oxygen lmao.", "Don't use big words if you don't know what they mean. Literally nothing i said was bigoted.", "I mean yeah she could have gotten a cheese pizza. But if 99% of the people liked the pep then i say thats a win. Shes not an asshole for providing free food for people. She literally tried to do the right thing and made it half cheese. Just for one person. And still gets called an AH\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Mind saying what city you live in? I guarantee I can easily find an Italian joint with a cheese pizza at a base price with toppings at an additional cost. \n\nI have NEVER seen it differently unless there is a special.", "I've never seen a place, where a margherita is not atleast 1$ cheaper than the next cheapest option. Literally just looked in the 3 local pizza menu's I had at hand, and all of them have the margherita 1$ cheaper than the next cheapest pizza.", "You are so fucking obsessed with this. You're wrong. Take your L and drop it.", "I do not have a link to every pizza place I\u2019ve ever been to, sorry \n\nBlocked for nonsense", "The original pizzas were just flatbread with tomato sauce. The buffalo that produced the milk from which the mozzarella was made wasn't even introduced into Italy until well after the pizza was invented.", "Take a walk.", "potato v potato", "Agreed.", "lol no", "Either everybody brings their own food or nobody does. You do not, as a leader, deliberately exclude one person.", "It can accommodate everyone if they make it a vegetarian pizza!", "19 people get cheese when they'd have preferred pepperoni, but they still have a tasty meal, and 1 person is content with the cheese. Everyone eats, and no one has to buy extra food.\n\nOr, 19 people get pepperoni and one person has to buy extra food. That's where the discrimination comes in. In no scenario do the 19 have to buy extra food.", "Then it is not a need for the pepperoni people either.", "OP is still discriminating against her employee on the basis of religion. You look really foolish defending her.", "You are not trying your best - you can get a damn cheese pizza.", "The school board comment was meant to be sarcasm. I\u2019m sure they would love to hear that you\u2019re taking money out of a discretionary fund of your school budget & buying everyone (except 1 teacher) dinner. \n\nPerhaps you could ask all the teachers how to solve this problem. Maybe collectively someone might have an idea of how to come up with a solution. (Also sarcasm) \n\nThere\u2019s no entitlement here. It\u2019s just rude. You\u2019re hosting a party (with school funds) & purposely not including one of the staff members based on religion. If that works for you then go ahead & do it your way.", "The entitlement is that peoples preference, not need of pepperoni, is more important than a need", "This isn't entitlement. It's holding up a mirror showing you the truth of your actions that you want to deny. You keep arguing in the comments instead of listening like a good educator would. Since you seem to believe that you're still right, even when it's been pointed out over & over that you're not, I must ask *why* are you posting here since you're refusing to listen to the judgment that *you* asked for?", "She didn't opt out.\n\n***You excluded her!***", "Yup. Yta.", "She didn\u2019t opt out, you are deliberately excluding her due to her religion. Opting out requires options. She had no option.\n\nYou are discriminating against your employee on the basis of religion. That is illegal. You will lose your job if you keep this up, I promise you.", "She didn't opt out, you did not accommodate her and therefore exclude her.", "Bosses all my life have paid out of pocket for dinner\u2026sounds like you\u2019re just cheap", "Based on your comments i'm guessing you know intimately how that feels.", "Chattanooga Tn! If you can find it let me know please. I\u2019ve never seen a price difference for cheese pizza vs a one topping. It should be cheaper, don\u2019t get me wrong but it\u2019s just not.", "Yes... OP should be bought a smaller one for them but 1/20 should not dictate how everyone else eats.\nEdit\nOP, YTA for not figuring out how else to feed one person.", "Lol, yes.", "This is about common sense not defending OP. Religion shouldn\u2019t be up for debate in this scenario. Someone religion is exactly that their religion. They should be free to belief it and practice their customs as long as in such that it does not impact and limits others. Now is this such a small issue? I mean it a pizza so ofcourse it is, now should OP ask if the other teachers are okay with just cheese? Yes ofcourse another no brain but if rightly or wrongly the majority of them still want something on the pizza that does not meet with the requirements of one individual why is it such a big fucking deal? It shouldn\u2019t be.", "You're an idiot.", "She 100% opted out. Choosing to follow a restricted diet is not on anyone else. This is no different that if she was doing keto and couldn\u2019t eat the crust.", "She's a school principal, she's not rolling in the dough. Jfc.", "Take a walk.", "Common sense would be to provide a pizza for your staff that all staff can eat. Basic cheese and tomato pizza is suitable. As the person in charge, the head needs to provide for all, not most, of their staff. Anything else is not fair.", "The one individual is being excluded and forced to buy food out of her own pocket whilst everybody else gets free food. \u201cEveryone else wants pepperoni!\u201d is just a convenient but VERY TRANSPARENTLY BIGOTED excuse to for exclusion. What don\u2019t you understand about that? You\u2019re fucking dense huh", "Yeah, I kind of agree here. This seems like a slippery slope. When does the accommodation end? What if Jenny and David have a gluten allergy, Steve and Tara are lactose intolerant, Jamal is allergic to tomatoes, Sally just doesn't care for pizza? Like it becomes impossible to accommodate all this under a reasonable budget, and the principal shouldn't be expected to pay out of pocket. So, then it becomes no food parties at all.", "It's nothing like keto. It's like if she was catholic and it was lent.", "Do you know how much principals make? Lol", "\"Everyone likes this and it's what we ordered for years\" is only 'transparently bigoted' if you're fucking crazy.", "Which is also exactly like choosing to go keto.", "Its still a voluntary choice"]}
