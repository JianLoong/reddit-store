She started school this year and I found out from a friend who\u2019s daughter goes to her school there that she has almost no school supplies, a backpack that\u2019s held together by duct tape, and old clothes that barely fit.\n\nI see no reason why my aunt can\u2019t afford to buy her the things she needs since we give her more than enough money and she probably gets government benefits too. I asked my cousin and she told me that our aunt often tells her that she\u2019s a burden and she didn\u2019t know that we give her money. I confronted my aunt and she said that we don\u2019t give her enough (bullshit) and said that if I care about her so much I can take her. \n\nI talked to my wife about her living with us and she is fine with it. We both have good jobs and are childfree so we can definitely afford it. My wife\u2019s sister (21F) also lives with us and when she found out she was mad. She said she doesn\u2019t want to live with a kid and she\u2019s only living with us because we\u2019re childfree. I told her that a low maintenance teen is very different from a screaming infant and my cousin isn\u2019t going to bother her. \n\nMy SIL has been sulking in her room since I told her and she called her mom. My MIL called me yesterday and yelled at me for spending so much on her while making her daughter pay to live with me ($500 for rent, food, and utilities) and told me that if I let my cousin stay with me then my SIL is going to move out. My wife thinks we should invite my MIL over and talk to them. I think they\u2019re being unreasonable.

If she's not wanting to spend $500 (sounds like she complained to mom on the phone about 15f potentially not paying) she will have a bit of a shock when she sees what an apartment costs to run on her own.  I guess MIL is upset because the kid's on YOUR side of the family, and therefore shouldn't be entitled to your collective money with your wife.

If your SIL wants to leave, let her.  She is living in your home. Period.  Let her know that she has absolutely no say in who else lives there and if she is upset, it probably would be better for her to maybe live on campus instead or in her own studio apartment.
