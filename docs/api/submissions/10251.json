Lying isn\u2019t great but pregnancy is allowed to be personal. Chances are if you would have said \u201cthat\u2019s a rude question\u201d when he asked, then he would have fixated on that and spiraled into a series of questioning. He needs to get over it.", "NTA and Congratulations! \n\nIf you had answered with anything other than a No, your dad would have been all \u2018why are you being evasive? You didn\u2019t say no, so she is isn\u2019t she!\u2019 And then he\u2019d be off telling everyone and the wedding would have been all about the pregnancy. And your bride (now wife) would have been upset on her wedding day.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d have wanted was to announce a 2 month pregnancy to every last friend and family at my wedding. It\u2019s too early and there is too great of a risk of losing it at that point. A wedding is very emotionally charged and I\u2019d have gone into an anxiety spiral thinking about what ifs. Besides it feels like it\u2019d jinx things.\n\nHonestly lying is the only thing you could have done. Good for you. Also your dad is TA", "So she was 2 months pregnant at the time?\n\n* Why would they even feel the need to ask about that? That sounds like they didn't approve of the wedding and thought you wanted to do this for reasons other than love. Clearly not because she was showing at the time.\n* You decided to get married way before she got pregnant.\n* Most people don't tell other people they're pregnant until way later than 2 months. Yes, that can include close family members.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Medical information is private. Dad needs to get over himself.", "I didn\u2019t tell anyone I was pregnant with my third till I was 3 months, not even my parents. If someone asked me before that I would have lied and said no because ITS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS. How I chose to share my personal matters is my choice. How I want to share my pregnancy is up to me and my bf. NTA.\n\nAnd it\u2019s rude to ask questions like this because you never know what they might be going through. Getting pregnant is not as easy for some couples and it can be a sensitive topic.", "Geeze!  You NEVER ask if a woman is pregnant let alone on a wedding day!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nRude, invasive questions about private matters do not warrant truthful (or, imho, even respectful) responses.", ">My brother thinks I am the asshole because I know our dad is different and gets fixated on things, and lying is one of those things.\n\nYour brother is an enabler and your dad is old enough to understand that sometimes he needs to let it go. He should also learn that he is not entitled to information on other people's lives and shouldn't get upset when he is lied to when asking inappropriate questions. NTA", "NTA. Pregnancy is something that is announced, not inquired about. Very rude of your father and none of his business.", "Best response I ever found for nosey questions: *\"Why are you asking?\"*\n\nAnd to their lame followup justification, look puzzled and ask *\"Yes, but why is that any concern of yours?\"*\n\nUsually folks slink away and I don't have to escalate to Defcon 3 (*\"Don't you think that's a very intrusive question to be asking me?\")*\n\nOP if your dad ever dares to raise the topic again, tell him *\"I have my own life, and I won't be answering questions that are none of your business, Dad. So don't ask them if you don't want a BS response.\"*\n\nMeantime, soft YTA for putting yourself on thin ice by lying, when you could have shut down the question like a boss by pointing out that it was inappropriate and disappointing.\n\nPS Congratulations on your baby girl!!", "NTA at all, lying about private matters when people are up in your business is completely fine. People who are saying otherwise are just.... lying. They'd do the same thing if it was a personal invasive question they weren't ready to answer", "NTA, your dad should be more fixated on being a grandfather", "NTA. If you wanted him to know she was pregnant obviously he would already know. If you ask questions like that you can and should be lied to. It's supremely selfish to expect anything else.", "One of the wisest things anyone ever told me was \u201cJust because someone asks a question doesn\u2019t mean they are entitled to the answer.\u201d\n\nIt perfect horrible to ask if someone is pregnant on their wedding day. NTA", "NTA. The only time I would dream of saying something that might suggest that I thought a woman I know was pregnant is if I could actually see her crowning", "NTA. It's never okay to ask if someone is pregnant, and the asked party doesn't owe the asking party a certain type of response. It was shitty of him to ask in the first place, and extra shitty to bring it back up.", "To me, NTA. It's really no one's business.", "NTA.", "NTA. He only asked to be an ass imo.", "NTA. If you were ready to announce back then, you would have; he had no good reason to ask.", "This is a tough one. Strictly speaking, that\u2019s a personal issue, and you\u2019re totally NTA for lying about it. However, your reasoning and the way you handled it makes it so that YTA. \n\nIf you had lied at the wedding and then later just said \u201cya know we weren\u2019t ready to tell people yet and talking about it at the wedding wasn\u2019t an appropriate setting\u201d, you\u2019d be totally fine. As they\u2019re your parents, it\u2019s not like they weren\u2019t gonna find out eventually. Parents can 100% be irritating, but I think them asking if they\u2019re about to become grandparents (whether it\u2019s the first grandchild or not) definitely isn\u2019t irrelevant", "YTA\n\nYour dad was right.  If you found the question rude, then you should have said so.  Downright lying was an AH move, though.", "YTA. Tell him he's being rude if you want.", "You\u2019re not the ah for not telling him, as that\u2019s your decision. But, you shouldn\u2019t have lied, just tell him it\u2019s a rude inappropriate question especially on that day and walk away. Also, it should have been very obvious that he would figure it out eventually and be upset especially If you know lying is a big thing for him. I guess I\u2019m going NAH. I don\u2019t think youre an ah I just think you could\u2019ve handled it better.", "YTA for being so irritated with him. He had a suspicion and asked you. From what you wrote you don't suspect he had any malicious intent with that question, as you would've said it. To be honest, it sounds like you dislike your father. It could have been quite a nice father-son bonding moment, you smiling knowingly when he asked but no. \n\nAgain: YTA not for not telling him but because you are snotty about something so harmless.", "YTA\n\n>well then why not say that? Why lie\n\nHe's right though. You lied to your father's face, over something you have every right to tell him it's not ok to ask, then not answer his question. You showed your father a lack of integrity, which has to be disappointing.", "Why is it rude your dad of all people asking if his daughter in law is pregnant? I understand you guys not wanting to announce it just yet but you could have told him the truth and asked him not to tell. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou should have just told him the question was offensive or something to that affect. You lied knowing that eventually everyone would know it was a lie. It shouldn\u2019t have been an issue to begin with. I suggest getting a good book on boundaries. You have a family now. Learn how to shut people down so that it\u2019s not an issue later.", "ESH.\n\nWrong to ask, wrong to lie.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
