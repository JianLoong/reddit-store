You suck because it feels weird to lie that she was pregnant if it was obvious. Why else would your father ask if you were already engaged for the year, and it was clearly not a shotgun wedding. Maybe he has a moral foundation where he feels like a couple should not even attempt to have children until marriage, but we both know that that assumed morality doesn't necessarily apply to your situation. Or maybe he's just nosy. Both circumstances are equally lame, so I get the apprehension. So why not just tell him, \"that's a rude question, I'm not going to answer it, and if you have a problem with that, you can go mingle with someone else or leave.\" I just find it weird to lie when you can just brush it off and have the same effect. I'll also add that if you're gatekeeping the pregnancy info, which I understand in most circumstances, then you can't be surprised/annoyed when you have a kid less than 9 months later after your marriage and instead of him asking \"why did you lie\", he'd be feeling bitterness about the fact that he wasn't involved. You kinda enabled the bitterness when the lie is added to it. Idk just my opinion on that front. I feel like telling him to chill and we may or may not talk about it will yield a better result than just lying, but that's just me. It seems pretty clear that you and your Dad aren't close, so that distinction may not matter, but I'm just making the point that the direct lie feels unnecessary.\n\n\nYour Dad sucks because he's very entitled to knowledge of anything going on in his kid's life. There are some parents who  just sit in bewilderment about why their kids do what you did. The reality is that when a parent interjects themselves into their adult children's lives, it's usually because that parent has deep rooted feelings of guilt or insecurity, but they never address those feelings through direct communication with their kids. It's always being nosy, upset, or just trying to stir up some drama on the most important times in their kid's life. I'm making quite a few assumptions with this, but my dad pulled this crap on my wedding day, but instead of asking why he wasn't a groomsman at my wedding, he decided to strut his wife who he left my mom for and punch my groomsman in the face. I went NC literally right after that moment, and it's been a net positive in my life. I use this example because it just seems there's some info being left out about the role, or lack thereof, your dad has had in your life. Probably wasn't a huge role or maybe the role was just as crap dad, but the post on its face reads as if you're not the biggest fan of your father. \n\nYou're entitled to set whatever boundaries you want in your relationship, but I think the lying only enables shitty behavior, not constructive behavior. When bad behavior is enabled, drama and the consequences of it start to affect your life in bigger and unintended ways. I don't think you're an asshole, I think you're very aware of your life and your family, I just think if you're trying to engage in having a more positive life, then you gotta nip the bs in the butt by enforcing boundaries without lies. Telling your Dad, \"Hey I'm getting married, leave this alone and if you got a problem with that you can go\" will do you way more favors than lying. Sorry for the essay.", "NTA.

That information is between her, her doctor, and anyone *she* chooses to talk about it with.", "NTA That sort of news is none of his business until you are ready to tell him.", "NTA. I was 2 months pregnant at my wedding too. I got asked why I wasn't drinking, and said I was taking antibiotics. Nobody but my mom believed me, and yet I still never got asked that. It's a rude question, and should be announced when the parents are ready.", "NTA and congratulations to you & and your wife!", "It wasn't like it was  your body he was questioning. \n\nGood on you for not letting your fathers quirks matter more then the overall comfort of your wife \n\nNta", "OP should have responded \"y\u00e8s, but it's okay, it's not mine.\" A clearly sarcastic answer like that tells Dad it was not appropriate to ask.", "NTA. If yall weren't announcing the pregnancy at that time there is no exemptions to who you tell. He should respect your wishes", "NTA. Ask a question that is none of your business and rude to boot, you are asking to be lied to.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t the time or place for him to be asking that question.", "And being told the wrong time of an event affects the person being lied to. What material difference does knowing whether she was pregnant on any given day have on him.", "If your mom buys that answer then good for you.  Most people will take that answer as default confirmation and then you are doing harm by not protecting your SO\u2019s medical info and also ruining her wedding day in the case of this situation.  Sometimes you have to lie to protect people from others who cannot stop pushing esp on her wedding day.  \n\nYour mom may be a more decent person and not push it but it sounds like Op\u2019s dad is borderline malicious in his quest to know the truth and would not buy that answer.  \n\nIf I can answer with a jedi lie I do bc I do not like lying and do it sparingly but also strategically, but given what op said about their dad the only other option that only works if you are skilled in manipulation, like I had to be to survive my dysfunctional family, is to flip it with something like, \u201comg dad are you trying to say my bride is fat on her wedding day? I cannot deal with this right now, you better not repeat that to others or ask anyone else esp not her bc this day is about her.  We will talk about this later.\u201d\nAnd then never talk about it later.  \n\nMy personal fav is implying my being pregnant at any given time is like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat situation.  Until I check I am both pregnant and not pregnant and halfway through that explanation over the years people stopped bothering me.  But gotta set that one up far in advance.  It\u2019s a long term payoff move.", "She doesn't buy it but she clearly knows she's not getting an answer because it's none of her damn business. \n\nIt's sounds like you have a more sarcastic approach to defuse things and kudos to you for that. I'm definitely more blunt and got this way because of manipulation and now I simply don't give a shit.", "Yeah it\u2019s hard. I describe my job before COVID-19 as running a preschool because that\u2019s basically what it was. There were so many times I wanted to strangle someone.", "Yes. Try on top of that 35 year old tell me that so and so did this, go fix it. It\u2019s like your in your late 30ds solve your disagreements yourself.", "No he doesn't.   Many people hide their pregnancies  for valid reasons.  It isn't ANYONES business until the couple deems it so.", "I teach middle school, so trust me, I understand. I hear \"Ms. Cooperart make him/her stop touching me\" so many times I hear it in my sleep now, lol. Still, we wouldn't do it if it wasn't worth it, right?", "Bruh how can the couple deem it so if you think the father of the child doesn't have right to know.", "It was the dad/father in law.  The son lied to his dad about his wife being pregnant.", "That\u2019s completely fine but his father is also allowed to be bothered without people telling him \u201cit\u2019s none of his business\u201d\n\nIt absolutely can be his business. Key word CAN. It totally depends on what the norm is in your culture.", "Read my comment again\n \nThe potential father has right to know if his partner is pregnant. I didn't say grandfather. You said NO ONE has reason to know.", "Looks like you\u2019re too busy trying to be right rather than read.", "Regardless of culture norm, it is 100% the right of the parents when to announce a pregnancy.\n\nToo many people use the excuse \"because they're family\" to entitle themselves to personal information of other family members. Blood does not automatically give you that right.", "I think you either don\u2019t understand the meaning of the word pedantic or you don\u2019t understand the importance of acknowledging that trans people exist and their lived experiences are important. \n\nIt is not pedantic to acknowledge trans experiences, it is vital and potentially life saving. But sure, go on with your feelings of annoyance that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your world view."]}
