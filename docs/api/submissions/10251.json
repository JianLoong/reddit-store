If anyone's looking for a default 'mind your own business' answer to this, may I suggest this routine: \n\nOne: \"Always possible, right honey?\" \\[giant theatrical wink\\] \n\nOther: Well, we don't have a cabbage patch, I haven't seen any storks around the place, but we have been shagging like bunny rabbits, so sure, there's always a chance!\" \\[giant theatrical buttgrab of partner\\] \"Is that enough information or shall we tell you about\" \\[other partner clamps hand over mouth to stop them\\] \n\nOne: \"Nooooo, this is not the right company for the banana story!\"", "NTA \n\nDad you get fixated on people telling lies \n\nI get fixated on people asking personal medical information when it\u2019s none of their damn business \n\nYou\u2019ll get told stuff when we decide it\u2019s time to tell you stuff and not before \n\nDo not ask private personal questions again or you\u2019ll risk getting lied to \n\nNow learn from it and move on or you\u2019ll not get to spend time with your family", "Also I can\u2019t stand when ppl say \u201cyou know how he/she is\u201d, as if anyone could not improve themselves.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your dad was being inappropriate. You didn't owe him that information.", "Okay but I love the dad\u2019s parade quote.", "Info: why did he ask that. Did he pick up on her not drinking when everyone else was or was it a comment on her appearance or something else? It's not that big a deal if you pick up that someone could be pregnant?\n\nI'm not sure it matters that much but everyone here seems very immature. Like when he asked why you lied why did you not give him a reason, just tell him you wanted to keep it to yourselves for a while? You seem to have gotten very defensive over a reasonable enough question.\n\nI'm leaning towards nta but maybe esh (except your child of course. Congrats!)", "NTA of course he would get a no to such a rude and invasive question, to which the true answer he was not owed nor had any business knowing until you were ready to tell him. Anything but a no would have been taken as a yes and obviously exposed something you weren\u2019t ready to tell him.  If he can\u2019t understand that then that says much more about him than you.", "NTA. Your dad isn\u2019t entitled to any answers from you about ANY questions. You\u2019re not a child anymore. He needs to stop with the holier than thou attitude. \n\nYour wife\u2019s status of reproduction is only your dad\u2019s business if you and your wife want it to be. He needs to back up and know his role.", "Why is your dad so interested in your\u2019s and your wife\u2019s sex life?\n\nNTA and well done for keeping your dad out of your bedroom.", "NTA-- I have had 4 people ask me if I was pregnant in the last couple years and I lie about it each time. DO NOT ASK, it's none of your business.", "NTA- You just don\u2019t ask even if you have suspicions you just don\u2019t ask it\u2019s rude and invasive. There is so much going on in pregnancy especially in early stages that it can be and is very scary some people are happy to announce early others rather keep to themselves either way it\u2019s up to the couple on who they tell when they tell and how they tell. Just because you ask doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to a answer or even a correct answer. \n\nAnother thing If op had of said yeah she is then who would of the dad told? Who would of overheard? A pregnancy is very personal to each individual.", "NTA - for obvious privacy reasons.  Your dad is being a bit obtuse about the whole thing, but he might not be TA here either tbf.  \n\nI also want to point out my response to \"what time is the 2:00 parade is a stupid question, but I wouldn't tell someone it was at 3:00.\" would be something along the lines of, yeah, I would tell them it's at 3, just to see how gullible they are.", "[removed]", "NAH youre dad is right, you need to get better at avoiding questions. you did NOT need to tell him \"yes\" or \"no\". you should have said \"what the hell kind of question is that?\"", "YTA Why lie? It's seems like pettiness on purpose and makes you distrustful", "I'd say a soft AH. Assuming you're a regular family that gets along with everyone. I feel like any dad would be curious if he's about to be a grandfather. I'll agree you should never ask a woman.  But you're both family. Why is it inappropriate? It's not like he had malicious intent. People say it's not his business, but if he's about to be a GRANDFATHER, I mean kind of is. Like I said, he has a right to be curious. Now you have the right not to tell him, obviously. But saying it was a \"stupid question\" is kind of stupid because that implies the pregnancy isn't an important event. I mean there was other ways to address the problem instead of getting all defensive", "Surprised no one has gone ESH on this one because that is what it looks like to me.\n\nYour dad was rude to have asked that question and had judgmental intentions when he asked it. But lying in response is wrong too. I'd say your dad is more of TA but you both are in the wrong here.", ">Why would they even feel the need to ask about that? \n\nI'm guessing he saw her avoiding alcohol (I was plied with SO MUCH on my wedding day). Still none of his damn business tho - people have so many reasons for not wanting to drink, but the *second* a woman 1. declines alcohol at an event or 2. dares to have any sort of nausea, ya just know it's gonna be \"PREGNANT?\" time by busybodies.", "Yeah the fianc\u00e9\u2019s pregnancy was none of the father\u2019s business, and seeing as so many things can go wrong during a pregnancy (not to mention how stressful it is) it\u2019s understandable to not want to divulge a lot of information to other people. And with the way OP\u2019s dad seems to be dragging this out, I\u2019m sure it will only push OP to tell him LESS going forward.", "[removed]", "Tell that to my dad", "When my parents moved back home with my brothers they were at a block party on the street my grandparents lived. My dad saw someone we knew and apparently asked my mom if the person was pregnant. She wasn\u2019t, she had just gotten really fat in the 3-4 years they were away.", "Because it's a weird question to ask?", "My friend did not know she was pregnant until 6 months. She was an adult. She also got a regular \"period\" during that time which is why she had no idea", "Yeah, but my guess is he saw her avoiding champagne/bar.", "Maybe you should try replying to all his rude questions with \"Why do you ask?\". Why did he ask that question? Was he implying it was a shotgun wedding?", "Sounds like he's on the Autism spectrum.", "Ok totally off topic but I work at an nonprofit community center that\u2019s for disabled adults and the community. There\u2019s this one guy, John (not his real name) who will ask the same question over and over until you answer it and then ask you the question again 5 seconds later. My friend who\u2019s the cofounder had some health issues in the two years before COVID-19 ( he almost died the second time). John kept asking where my friend was/ what happened. I just had to keep lying to him.

She\u2019d seen a bunch of doctors/done a whole lot of tests/tried what they recommended with no success and was waiting to see this top fertility specialist. So of course when she finally got in to see her, she requested her own tests and when she got the results back, her response was \u201cyou\u2019re actually already pregnant\u201d. Yet I was the opposite- everyone pretty much knew I was pregnant before I even hit 12 weeks because I was so sick and I looked like I was carrying triplets (why are short, petite girls always attracted to big, tall guys?)", "Watch out for those fingernails though, they're like little daggers!", "Woman here.

Especially at a wedding, where news like that is going to travel fast. I can't understand why dad would even ask - at the very least, why not wait, and ask in private, after the wedding day?", "Fair enough, that's exactly why I said: we have massively different cultural references, and it's not rude to ask women here because we don't have those risks. But this being reddit, people just downvote because it doesn't fit their cultural scheme. Anyhow, thanks for explaining that side of it.", "I'll just go ahead and cancel out a couple of those down votes! I love learning cultural differences!\n\nI'm in the UK, and we're very wary of asking anyone if they're pregnant. Not because we're not nosy, we absolutely are, but because we're terrified of being wrong!\n\nThe only time you should comment on a woman's pregnancy is when she's so obviously pregnant she's about to pop! Then, if she seems approachable, it's okay to ask when she's due, if it's her first, and if she knows the gender. If she looks tired or grumpy, you may offer her a seat, or offer to help her carry things.\n\nThat said, way too many people think that having a baby when you're in a same sex marriage somehow means you can ask whatever you like... \ud83d\ude11"]}
