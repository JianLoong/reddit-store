Sounds to me like you were embarrassed you got your fianc\u00e9 pregnant and didn\u2019t want to tell your dad or maybe you thought your dad would be disappointed-either way lying makes you the AH.  If it private- say so. Your dad made a valid point.  He didn\u2019t lecture you on safe sex or sex before marriage.  If you are not that close why did you invite him to fly in for a wedding and spend money?  Your dad isn\u2019t fixated on things- you lied when speaking the truth was possible:  \u201cDad, I\u2019d rather not discuss that,\u201d or \u201cDad, that is a rude question; I am not answering it.\u201d  He brought up the conversation the second time because he realized his son can\u2019t tell the truth.  Look at what you wrote.  He discussed your dishonesty not the pregnancy. You we\u2019re getting married and about to be a dad- I think it\u2019s time you learn to tell people the truth no matter the situation or person with whom you are speaking. Seems the issue is with you making boundaries and honesty.", "YTAH- you had other options- answered truthfully, declined to answer politely, declined to answer and explained you found his question intrusive- or simply ignored it. \nThere was no reason to lie- other than you chose to", "Or maybe... don't lie and be honest that you don't want to share about your reproduction before you're ready to talk about it? It's an absolutely appropriate answer. Instead of you know, lying in someone's face and having the truth come out.\n\nThe amount of times people had \"preemies\" which were clearly full term is laughable. The truth comes out in a from of a live human and proves you're a liar.", "This is the only correct answer if one chooses to engage.", "I think you're on to something. Asking prying questions about OP's dad prostate or other bodyparts could do the trick.   \n\"Dad, how about your bowel movements? I've heard people your age should up their fiber intake to make sure you poop in an appropriate timeframe. Have you been pooping well? Does it smell worse when you eat red meat?\"\n\nNTA", "I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I know you're busy. I really do. But I have just one more question.", "No it was not. It was their pregnancy they have the right to decide when to disclose that information.", "OPs dad doesn\u2019t sound like the bonding type.", "He didn't want to tell him his wife was pregnant. His right.", "It would not. Unless the answer to a question about pregnancy is an outright \u201cno,\u201d it might as well be a \u201cyes.\u201d", "After finally telling them about number 2 I would have gotten medieval on their asses. DH should have told them to back the hell off the second time as well. \n\nIt's just wildly inappropriate to presume you even get an opinion let alone sling it at the couple. And zeroing in on you to blame us outrageous.", "Even if it was past that date, they had every right to choose their moment to share. And there are lots of reasons why the wedding may not be that moment.", "HOW is that a fair question? It\u2019s shockingly rude.", "Because he didn't want to give this information to his father.", "It was. The wife was 2 months pregnant she could've lost the pregnancy. \nYou are lied to all the time with this attitude.", "Because obviously nobody can be trusted not to blab all over town (EXCITED GRANDPARENTS!) and the couple gets to decide who they'd want to be in the know in case of miscarriage. Their decision.\n\nI have experienced a relative \"just letting it slip once (a lie)\" and then being congratulated in the days after my miscarriage. While still processing the raw emotions, not reliably able to keep my composure. And while loss should be normalized etc., people deserve to do their crying in a safe space with safe people, not someone who heard it on the grapevine. \n\nThey also deserve the opportunity to share the good news themselves, when THEY want to. \n\nFor both of these reasons, it's a stupid question at the wedding - if you have to ask, it's NOYB by definition. If you were in the tellable group you'd already know. And asking later why you weren't told is also stupid. Miscarriage and wanting to plan your announcements aren't exactly Stephen Hawking-level concepts. \n\nThe grandparents 0% need to know until the couple decides they do. It's not like being in the know sooner will make the baby arrive sooner. \n\nI kinda think at the birth the dad wasn't just backing the hell off and enjoying the gradkid's arrival, as he should have been. People usually get defensive when the other person is digging in and making it a Thing.", "It was not wrong.", "Yes there is. They were not in the 3 month mark, it was not his place to disclose this information unilaterally. He", "It doesn't sound like he's going to be a great grandpa.\n\nNTA", "It was a rude question.", "It shouldn't been asked. If they wanted him to know they would've told him.", "He is not privy of this information. People usually wait until 3 months to disclose.", "Not only this, but if he'd said yes or sounded cagey at all, dad might have blabbed to the entire group, shifting the focus from the couple in love and pledging their lives to each other, to \"new baby!!\" The purpose of a wedding is not to announce a pregnancy, just like a funeral is not the time to announce someone's engagement, and someone else's baby shower is not the time to come out to your family, etc.", "I think it all depends on how well you can keep your mouth shut.  Do the parents get the concept of not wanting everyone to know because you want to announce the news yourself?  Do they understand you not wanting anyone else to know until after three months so that you don't have to tell alot of people there isn't going to be a baby if something goes wrong at the critical three month point?  If so, then you might in fact want to tell the four (if they're all around) Grandparents-to-be early, exactly so that you'll have a support system if you need it.  There's no shame in miscarriage, and you shouldn't have to go through it alone.\n\nHowever, I have a suspicion OP's Dad isn't that kind of parent.  NTA.  Telling the Grands earlier than other people is a courtesy due to them being the next closest people to baby.  It's not a requirement or mandate.", "[removed]", "Congratulations and every happiness to your new family!\n\nIf dad brings this up again, tell him that NOBODY acknowledges pregnancy during the first trimester. And that this is a \u201chim\u201d problem to need to insert himself into personal information.", "NTA- she wasn\u2019t far enough along for you to feel comfortable disclosing, it\u2019s none of his business , you weren\u2019t married because she was pregnant- not that it matters , and you didn\u2019t want him to disclose it to anyone else in your big day. You had no other choice . I\u2019m sorry your dad is a jerk or lacks social skills or both .", "Good rule of thumb: if you have to ask, you're not someone they're telling. If they're telling anyone.", "What does that matter? Asking if a woman is pregnant is generally considered rude no matter who gets asked the actual question.\n\nEspecially on a wedding day.", ">I ask women are they pregnant all the time lol I ask their ages too, shocker.\n\nThat makes you the rude one,even if you don't realize it yet.", "As a non-American woman who had to deal with infertility and several miscarriages, let me tell you that you are an asshole.", "What you are saying is  I act like a jerk all the time and OP is wrong to put people like me in their lanes.", "I like how you mention asking about age - *another thing you know is rude.*\n\nYou're not edgy, you don't do this, and you know it's rude. Stop lying for clout.", "It\u2019s not standoffish. She was 2 months pregnant. 1 in 4 will miscarry before 12 weeks. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business.", "Tip: If you haven't been told, then you're not someone who makes the cut of being told at that point. The cut may be \"the couple and medical people.\" There's no reason to ask no matter what you think you observe. No reason to expect to be told the truth if you do ask.\n\nBut you're right that \"we weren't telling people yet because of miscarriage\" should shut down every objection afterward. \n\nEvading the question would have just been taken as a yes.\n\nIt would be smart for women to cultivate a lie about why they're avoiding alcohol because intrusive relatives will run with it regardless.", "A parent who's not entitled to the information till the people whose info it is are ready to share.", "The time for personal questions ended when the child becomes an adult and independent of the parent. It was literally OP\u2019s wedding day. He\u2019s grown up. His dad needs to remember he\u2019s no longer an active parent of a minor, he\u2019s a peer of an adult child.", "Just because ur a parent doesn\u2019t give you the right to ask personal questions especially when they\u2019re an adult. It\u2019s not a valid question either especially if he had no reasons to ask either.", "I just simply disagree is all and think OP was a little too sensitive. Seems like his parents already had a gut feeling anyway.", "Based off a question???", "The pregnancy isn\u2019t the point.  If he doesn\u2019t want to disclose or discuss he needs to say that, make his boundaries known, not lie.", "So what? They\u2019re still not entitled to information about her womb before she\u2019s ready to share it", "I had the same thought.", "I was thinking that as well. OPs dad sounds absolutely obnoxious and horrible to deal with.", "That still doesn't give him free reign to not drop the subject when he's told to. I find alot of autistic people, particularly the men, use that as an excuse to be as insensitive as they please because no one has ever held them accountable for their words. It's chalked up to \"well he's just autistic\" or \"well we know how Dad is, you know he gets hung up on things\". Autistic or not, making a mountain out of a mole hill over his son choosing to keep his wife's pregnancy private for the time being, *particularly at the wedding*, is ridiculous. Especially with his dad framing it like it was some egregious betrayal of a lie.\n\nEDIT: Before anyone asks, I'm not being abelist, I'm also on the spectrum and the issue of how men with autism are treated/what we expect from them vs how women with autism are treated/what we expect from them is an ongoing conversation that's really only just started within the last few years.", "Or he could be an asshole who uses \u2018I hate being lied to\u2019 as a stick to beat his children with.", "If you really read OPs post it's obvious that his father has some issues with obsessing (OCD or something on the autism spectrum) and deflecting wasn't going to work).  You'd be right if dad was neurotypical and just an ass but it sounds like that's not the case and OP dealt with the situation in a way that addressed his father's neurodivergence.", "And he didn't want to tell him. That's his right.", "Yes! Because there was nothing to communicate to the father. They didn't want to and he was being rude.", "lol no", "That shouldn't be confirmed if the couple didn't feel ready", "Based off his literal stated belief (as recounted by OP) the he's entitled to a truthful answer even to an admittedly inappropriate question.\n\nI'd be worrying about boundary stomping.\n\nI'd also be worried about his willful disregard of the perfectly fine reasons not to announce a pregnancy a) at 2 months and b) at one's wedding.", "Too easy for that to become, \u201cYou\u2019re dodging the question, I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\nI have had to lie to folks rude enough to ask about a pregnancy, it absolutely can be a boundary setter.", "What answer he would infer from this since he is all over business that are not theirs.", "To a lot of people, that is a clear \"yes\". Anything other than a straight \"no\" is an affirmation.

The lie shut down the conversation where refusing to answer would have been seen as either confirmation or an opening to continue investigating. \n\nAs OP has said, his dad likes to be proven right so I did not believe \u201cThat\u2019s a rude question\u201d would have been the end of it.", "SO true!\nSpeaking as a petite young woman with a giant boyfriend \ud83e\udd23", "Hey, at least your 4 year old knows what a chickpea is.
