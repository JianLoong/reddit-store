If his academics wouldn't get into one of them then look at Florida, Boston College, Wisconsin, Texas, Georgia Tech, Georgia, or Ohio State.  A player actually good enough to be offered scholarships by the best programs is also being offered admission to a number of highly regarded academic institutions.", "NTA - even if he makes it to the nba, does he know what the actual success record is for professional athletes? Most don\u2019t last long and due to lack of planning end up broke\u2026", "NTA. I\u2019m in a rare position to contribute here as someone who actually works in the pro basketball world (though not in scouting or for a team). Some stats for you:\n\n- There are 450 full-time roster spots in the NBA and 90 two-way spots (which earn only five figures each).\n\n- There are 358 Division I basketball teams, each with up to 15 players apiece. There are also dedicated pro prep programs (G-League Ignite, Overtime Elite) and a plethora of foreign players all trying to make the jump to the NBA. This effectively means that thousands of players are fighting for one of those 540 spots each year.\n\n- Many of those 540 spots are locked into multi-year deals. In a given offseason, maybe half of those 540 spots are \u201cavailable,\u201d and most of them are taken up by players within the existing pool changing teams. Not all 60 draft picks each year ultimately make a team. Most undrafted players get a shot at Summer League or training camp before fizzling out and either playing in the G-League or abroad or beginning a new, non-playing career.\n\n- The average NBA career is four years. The reality is that long-time veterans skew these numbers. The median is closer to two I believe. If you can stick around and get to a second contract, you have a chance at life-changing money, but you don\u2019t just have to squeeze into the 540 to get that, you realistically have to be in the top third or so of that group (teams have to think of you as a long-term starter to make a multi-year, multi-million dollar commitment).\n\n- Getting any sort of guarantee of life-changing money as a rookie comes down to being a first-round pick. Fortunately, you should already have an idea of whether or not this is possible. The majority of FRP\u2019s are underclassmen, as teams believe younger players have more long-term upside. It\u2019s possible for a freshman to buck class rankings, but not many do it each year. So where do the major ranking sites have your son? If he\u2019s a top 15-20 prospect in his class, he has a real shot. If he\u2019s No. 90? Outside chance. If he\u2019s No. 190? He probably isn\u2019t even gonna get the playing time as a freshman to prove himself. You can still make the NBA as an upperclassmen, but it gets rarer every year. Generally, teams think if someone could have played in the NBA at a younger age, they would have. But basically, the guys who get drafted high are usually teenagers who spend a year in college but were destined to go pro for years in advance. You\u2019ll know if this is your son.\n\nYour son might make the NBA. I don\u2019t know who he is or where he\u2019s going to school, but if he believes it\u2019s possible, I\u2019m inclined to believe that\u2019s an informed belief. However, the sad reality of anyone trying to reach the NBA is that these are the likeliest outcomes, in order:\n\n1. Doesn\u2019t reach the NBA because they\u2019re not good enough.\n2. Doesn\u2019t reach the NBA because of injuries.\n3. Reaches the NBA only briefly, as a Summer League/training camp player who then needs to survive in the G-League or on 10-day contracts.\n4. Reaches the NBA and builds a sustainable career there.\n\nThere is a small subset of players who should be prioritizing playing for a school that will maximize their pro potential. Maybe that\u2019s your son and maybe it isn\u2019t. But I\u2019d say that the majority of D1 prospects should assume they won\u2019t be playing professional basketball, or at least that they shouldn\u2019t treat it as a given. I would advise them to prioritize a) academics, b) culture (where are you going to enjoy yourself and grow as a person?) and c) coaching staff (ultimately you\u2019re much better off at a slightly less prestigious program if it\u2019s with a coach that believes in you and has a strong vision of how to help you become the best player you can be). The last thing you want is to go to a basketball powerhouse and not play because every other kid on the team was a similarly talented prospect and only realize after the fact that you missed out on a better college experience. That\u2019s my two cents.", "This is an excellent point!", "This should be top comment.

Because if he\u2019s good enough to be getting D1 offers, he should be looking into maximizing the basketball aspect of the school. Even if he\u2019s not a 1-and-done lottery pick, he could make a ridiculous amount of money as a second round pick or even playing overseas in Europe/Australia. He can always go back to school after his playing career is over. Also let\u2019s not pretend that any university he plays for is really going to look out for or care about his actual education. There\u2019s special tutors and test banks for athletes. Let him use this very limited opportunity to max out what he can be as a player and then adjust. Playing D1 basketball can open a lot of doors through boosters & alumni programs too.", "Going with a small Y T A, only because him believing you don't have faith in him can be detrimental to his self esteem. It would have been better to phrase it differently. For instance \"You don't know what the future holds, you're going to need a fall back if you ever get injured\".  Or, \" you should major in business when you do make it to the NBA you'll know what you're doing with your money instead of relying on someone who might cheat you.\"  Business is a good major for athletes intending to go pro.  Another option is kinesiology, which can help him understand how to keep his body in shape as a professional athlete.", "NTA. I'd be ashamed I raised a kid so completely clueless though.

You see all the time that first round picks, even lottery picks, fizzle out of the league in a few years.

Yes, the NBA is the peak of the sport, but if it can't be done, there are other opportunities.\n\nBut once all that is over, in roughly 10 years, there needs to be something else, and academics are important.  A lot of former players go back to school to complete their degrees, or they even work on them during the off-season of their playing careers.  He needs to keep these things in mind, while also trying to prove his abilities to the scouts out there on the court.  Every professional athlete, from those who have achieved greatness, to the 15th man on an NBA bench has to stop playing basketball some day.

We were all heartbroken for him. It absolutely happens. He tore another labrem a year later trying to get back into it (hip then shoulder respectively). So the poor guy has had two surgeries. It hurts not seeing him live his dream but he picked a good school for education and heads up (coaches) the recreational team, I believe its called. He actually helped start the team and im so proud of him.

I have an uncle who is tangentially involved with the basketball program at a D1 school, and one of the things he tries to tell all the players who come through is that they *really need* to focus on their academics too, and specifically warns them about the chances of winding up broke, even if they make it big first. I don't know if any of them have listened, but he keeps trying.\n\n(My uncle could have played pro basketball, but it was the 60s, when pro players had to have a job in the off-season, so he decided against it and just went to work after he graduated. He grew up lower-middle-class, and eventually made his fortune by working his ass off and then investing wisely.
