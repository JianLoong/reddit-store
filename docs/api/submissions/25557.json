You didn't say he wouldn't get into the NBA, you even encouraged him to continue to pursue his passion.

It\u2019s a hard conversation and you\u2019re doing the adult thing. Had the same convo with my dad when I was going to school. And I had the same response as your son.", "NTA, there's a big difference between \"will never make it to the NBA\" and \"*may* never make it to the NBA.\" You're not crushing his dreams, just telling him there are no guarantees and he needs a backup plan. And that's true - he does need a backup plan. Everyone does. Even the most talented and promising athletes can get injured and find themselves out of a job.", "I'd be curious what the actual arguments here were, assuming this is real.  Looking at both is a perfectly reasonable option, there's no reason to dismiss basketball powerhouses out of hand, just scrolling through the latest US News rankings, Duke is 10, UCLA is 20, Michigan and Virginia are tied at 25, and North Carolina is 29, all of whom have made at least one Final Four in the past 6 years and there are plenty of credible basketball programs that are ranked alongside them.

You really shouldn't have added that in.", "INFO: you say your son is a senior this year, so his first year of college will be next? The real question is whether he shows up on 2025 mock drafts, particularly in the first round. Also which schools specifically he\u2019s received offers from. \n\nIf he\u2019s good enough to receive offers from Kentucky, Duke, Kansas, etc and is showing up on draft boards, he really should make it a priority to go where he can best maximize his potential for the NBA while also making a tidy sum of NIL money. That means somewhere he will get playing time, with a coach that will prepare him for the NBA, and a school with regular TV games. \n\nIf he\u2019s being recruited by smaller D1 schools, he does need to focus more on his education, because it\u2019s more likely that he\u2019s going to graduate.\n\nETA: keep in mind that if it\u2019s clear after his first year that the NBA isn\u2019t going to happen, he can enter the transfer portal to a school where his academic goals can be met better.", "If your son was trending towards a career in some other competitive field, such as teaching, you would absolutely be the asshole.  However, there are less than 1000 NBA players out of eight billion humans on Earth.  That would equate to odds of less than 0.0000125% that your son will play in the NBA.  And that\u2019s only assuming he makes the roster.  A lot of teams employ seven- or eight-man rotations except in garbage time, so his odds of getting regular minutes is less than half the odds he makes a roster.\n\nIs that something your son would want?  It might be, especially if he\u2019s very team-centric.  At the same time, though, it\u2019s a long, hard, highly-competitive process he will have to go through.  It\u2019s not for people who are anything but 1000% committed.\n\nI\u2019m voting NTA \u2018cause you\u2019re definitely not wrong for wanting the best for your son.  Maybe encourage him to see if there are careers in the business side of basketball (like game-day operations, merchandising, scouting, or the like) that he would enjoy.  That\u2019s a means for meeting in the middle.\n\nDisclaimer \u2018cause I know people are going to ask.

NFL scouted but his height was a no go. Good news he was at a top school and got good grades so he has a profession outside of football. Even playing D1 isn\u2019t enough to ensure professional play.

It might soften the message.", "You can still tell someone a backup plan is smart without crushing Them like she did. YTA", "truth!", "He\u2019s his parent.
