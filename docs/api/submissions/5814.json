She also said she wasted her money on the photos because she wanted some with the whole family, but now we\u2019ll have to take different ones since my daughter and I aren\u2019t in those.\n\nI offered to send her the pictures that Sage and I took at home but she refused those and said that at this point I was just mocking her.
