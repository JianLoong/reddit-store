It looked like he might be talking to the Alexa sitting at the table. My mom started smiling really big and asked me if I could make it look like her dog was asking the Alexa to play \"Who Let the Dogs Out\". I edited the photo, and it looked pretty cringy, but my mom loved it. She asked if we could put that on the back instead of the other photos. I said of course. One side was a cute photo of my family and the other was a funny photo of my mom's dog. We printed them and sent them out.\n\nWhen the card my wife and I had ordered arrived she was pissed. She went off on me for putting the quote \"a photo of that nasty ass dog with a stupid meme a 10 yo could've thought of\" I'd known she hadn't liked my mom's dog very much but I didn't think she'd get this mad. Since we are hosting Christmas she didn't want the ugly card I made with my mom displayed she made another Christmas card and told me to send them out to everyone with apologies for the joke card. I said no. I changed 2022 to 2023 on the card she made and said we'll use them next year. I put them in a box and that was that. My wife is beyond furious telling me I chose my mom over my life partner. She's been tearing the house apart trying to find the cards she made.\n\nBefore I was so confident that I was right but seeing her this mad has made me wonder AITA?\n\nEdit: The card was written in my family's name (mom, dad, siblings, siblings s/o, me) My older brother suggested couples therapy which my wife and I think is a good idea.

Apologize for sending a card?  Really?  I am sure no one is offended.  \n\nAt the same time when you say your mom is dying \"soon\" but that is by your calculations two-ish years away, I wonder if maybe your partner feels like her desires are an after thought, because it has to be all about mom for the next 2+ years.

You do not know me or my family at all.", "I get it but I can imagine this from the wife\u2019s perspective\u2026mom always gets her way because \u201cthis might be her last Christmas/thanksgiving/New Years/birthday etc.\u201d \n\nBut the truth is mom might live another ten years and any one of us can get hit by a bus tomorrow. I just don\u2019t think impending death is a great reason to give someone their way when a decision should be up to someone else. We\u2019re all dying. Cheers lol.", "Sorry that was unclear let me try again\n\nWhen I was with my mom and I saw her so happy I just felt like she was so happy I  wanted her to be happy so I did it. I wasn't thinking of my wife in the moment I was thinking about my mom\n\nSorry if that doesn't answer your question", "No need to apologize! People saying YTA gives me good feedback on how to be better for the future. This is definitely a one time thing.", "It isn't. My dad was with us and loved the idea and my siblings and their s/o all put a lot of good work into the front of the card. This isn't a tradition just a one-time thing.", "From one of OP's replies, she said that her mom is the one that usually handles the Christmas cards for the family. So it really sounds like the wife and OP are the ones who need to send out their own in the future.", "I doubt due to your wife's response that what your saying  is completely factual.", "Yeah but a good and happy life doesn't mean doing everything a person wants. You could have compromised.", "But still the card the the OP's family card like I can understand her getting mad if they did this to their own like couple christmas card but it's his family I think they should be able to decide wat goes on the card without their being this kind of blow up after lol", "Mom should get her way on her family card. This wasn't the wife's card to control.\n\nIt was also a card that mom always wanted to send.\n\nYou must be a wonderful comfort to people in your life since people with terminal conditions shouldn't get their way. \n\nWe will all die some day, but I assure you that is not the same as having a terminal condition.", "Is it always like this?", "Who suggested it? Was there a specific reason for wanting to do these cards this year?\n\nHoliday cards are a big deal where I am from. Most families don\u2019t send out one card from the whole family, it\u2019s usually each nuclear family does their own. Most times the cards are planned family photos (that are expensive, professional family photos run anywhere from $300 to $500 where I am), and include a bit of info on the family for the year (what each kid was doing/into). These are sent to friends and family and some colleagues. They can be funny, but it depends on the family sending them.\n\nIt sort of sounds like some members of your family (your wife) wanted this to be a real professionally done deal. And that the photoshopped dog photo was a big slap in the face to that. It seems like your mom and dad have a different sense of humor than your wife. Which is fine, then just send out separate cards.\n\nI don\u2019t know why you are gatekeeping the different cards. Yeah your wife overreacted at first, but I can see where I would also be pissed if I put a lot of hard work and paid good money for family photos and someone just crapped on all that work and time by adding a photo I did not approve to my card. Let your wife send out the cards she wants (without her originally snarky retort that she has since backed off of). \n\nNext year, every part of the family sends out their own card they want to send out. \n\nHolidays are so stressful, don\u2019t make it harder than it needs to be. Be the bigger person and help diffuse the situation.", "I typed this out pretty quickly I just need responses from someone who wasn't family or friends and had a bias. So I may not have included everything just what I thought was important. My wife does have anger issues though.", "I didn\u2019t think much about death until my dad passed away unexpectedly last year. He was 71 and in excellent shape with no known health problems. There are many older, sicker members of my family still alive today.\n\nIt\u2019s silly to make decisions based on who you think will die first. No one knows.", "Can you elaborate?", "It was my mom's idea and we did it for her so she could be happy. \n\nThis wasn't something we'd ever heard of so we thought why not try something \"fun\" this year.\n\nYeah you're definitely right my wife wanted something very professional and my parents wanted something cute, funny, wholesome, etc\n\nThanks for the advice!", "We are talking about a damned Christmas card that a terminally ill woman wanted to put on her family holiday card and he spoiled brat of a daughter in law who threw a tantrum.\n\nI don't think it's a stretch to say that she should get what she wants.", "I think they meant to ask, do you always think about your mom and disregard your wife's feelings?\n\nAlso, I understand wanting to make your mom happy, I seriously and honestly do, believe me, but you shouldn't forget your wife's feelings and how she will think. Why not make those the \"family\" cards and have separate ones for your household or everyone's household?", "This was a big communication break down of expectations. I think some heartfelt apologies and hugs could go a long way. I think if you started by apologizing to your wife and give her the cards she wants to send out, or even mail them out for her, it would do wonders. And tell her that next year you will send out your own cards and you can help your mom and dad send out their own quirky ones. We all make mistakes, no reason we can\u2019t move past them.\n\nGood luck, OP!\n\nMy final verdict:NAH", "Ok \ud83d\ude43"]}
