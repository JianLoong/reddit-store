It looked like he might be talking to the Alexa sitting at the table. My mom started smiling really big and asked me if I could make it look like her dog was asking the Alexa to play \"Who Let the Dogs Out\". I edited the photo, and it looked pretty cringy, but my mom loved it. She asked if we could put that on the back instead of the other photos. I said of course. One side was a cute photo of my family and the other was a funny photo of my mom's dog. We printed them and sent them out.\n\nWhen the card my wife and I had ordered arrived she was pissed. She went off on me for putting the quote \"a photo of that nasty ass dog with a stupid meme a 10 yo could've thought of\" I'd known she hadn't liked my mom's dog very much but I didn't think she'd get this mad. Since we are hosting Christmas she didn't want the ugly card I made with my mom displayed she made another Christmas card and told me to send them out to everyone with apologies for the joke card. I said no. I changed 2022 to 2023 on the card she made and said we'll use them next year. I put them in a box and that was that. My wife is beyond furious telling me I chose my mom over my life partner. She's been tearing the house apart trying to find the cards she made.\n\nBefore I was so confident that I was right but seeing her this mad has made me wonder AITA?\n\nEdit: The card was written in my family's name (mom, dad, siblings, siblings s/o, me) My older brother suggested couples therapy which my wife and I think is a good idea.

Immarure and childish. Lacking in compassion and kindness. I've never met her, but based on this incident alone, I already don't like her.

Why couldn't you have told her about it? It involves her too! And hiding the cards from her is beyond childish. I don't like her reaction being so harsh because who really cares about the cards that much, you had a reason for picking that picture, but you just refuse to let her have any say in these cards and thats just wrong and unfair. You can't spend the rest of your Mom's life treating your wife like shit if you expect to spend the rest of yours with her.

If you're exaggerating, then she's NAH too.)\n\nHere's what I read: My mother, who has had health problems for her entire life, is getting older and more fragile (as we all do). We don't think she'll make it for more than 3 years (or she could make it another 5 or 10 or more.) So we're doing everything the way she wants, disregarding our SOs' wants, even though, statistically, we'll be with them for many more years.\n\nI, of course, could be reading it wrong but look closely at how you've been with your mom vs your wife and see if there is anything to the fact that you might, just \\*might\\*, be catering to your mom over your wife \\*too much\\*. Because this isn't about a Christmas card. If things were as cut and dry as you say, your wife wouldn't be freaking out about a dog on a Christmas card. And, I'll be honest here, why are you so set on using your mom's dog on \\*your\\* Christmas cards? Why not let your mom have the dog and you and your wife have something else? That's why it seems to me like a little too much of you deferring to your mom and ignoring your wife. Her OTT reaction and you not seeing the compromise.", "ESH. 1. You put your mom\u2019s dog on a card from you and your wife without her consent. Need I say more? 2. You\u2019d mom is using her condition to influence you. 3.

Just don\u2019t display either.", "INFO: why couldn't you have done a half batch of both?\n\nThey're clearly both excited about the card but I get why your wife wants a card of her choosing to go out to her contacts.", "NTA: as you state multiple times in the comments, it\u2019s your mom\u2019s fucking Christmas card. Your wife can have her own cards. Unreasonable behavior.", "ESH, you more - but not your mom. Should you have spoken to your wife before sending the cards? Your wife could have shown more empathy and not pit herself against your mother. But in this case you failed to communicate with her, and dug yourself a nice little hole.

Almost no one remembers Christmas cards.  No one especially remembers the back of Christmas cards.  And if they do, they certainly don't care.  Except apparently your wife.  Apologize for sending a card?  Really?  I am sure no one is offended.  \n\nAt the same time when you say your mom is dying \"soon\" but that is by your calculations two-ish years away, I wonder if maybe your partner feels like her desires are an after thought, because it has to be all about mom for the next 2+ years.  And if so you both need therapy together and individually.  This is a tough situation to be in for everyone, and telling her that she just needs to suck stuff up for 2 or more years will build a whooole bunch of resentment that you might not recover from.  Everyone needs to be sensitive to everyone cause no one has gone through this before.", "This was so simple.
