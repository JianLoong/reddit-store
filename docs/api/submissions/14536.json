YTA. You literally know that your nephew is the favorite, and your niece had to go to the doctor. That kid could've waited until his sister could go as well. What made you think this was a good idea?

It was he couldn't see the movie exactly when he wanted to?\n\n He's 17 and you just validated his need to get his own way over his sister's medical needs.

You should have asked his parents before you took him anywhere. You are inserting yourself into their family issues, and that is not your place.

What's your deal?", "YTA. You knew what you were doing. Just own up to it and be ok with it. How much does it suck for Sadie to have to get a medical condition for her parents to pay her any attention. Think about that for a second. You obviously don\u2019t agree that the golden child needs to get off his throne otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have done it. Also, it\u2019s never too late for a parent to do right by their child.

Without talking to his parents or anything. You could have easily offered to take both kids another day but you chose not to.", "Dude, come on, YTA majorly. That was a huge F you to everyone except Shawn. To Sadie who wanted to go with Shawn and is suffering in her own body.

He's not a young child, and you've admitted he's been treated favorably over his sister until very recently. \nHe explicitly told you he was not to see the movie without the family, and you completely disregarded his parents wishes or the impact on your neice. \nYour nephew needs to learn some empathy and that the world doesn't revolve around him.", "OK .... so you write:\n\n>*Recently talked to Shawn and he told me how he wanted to watch the new Mario movie at the cinema but was not allowed to because Sadie wanted to watch it with him and the day he wanted to watch it was her doctor's appointment.*\n\nAnd you seriously have to ask if YTA? **Of course YTA.** It's not like Shawn was never going to be able to watch the film, he just had to wait a day or 2.\n\nGenuinely curious, OP: Why did you do it?", "YTA\nYou not only went against the family's explicit wishes for going to the cinema together, you also did it in a way that excluded your niece who has been traumatised by neglect and is struggling with a serious skin issue.

Really going against the grain here. I\u2019m a parent, and regardless of that, stupid rules are just begging to be broken.

This is pure conjecture, but watching that movie together is a weird thing for Sadie to insist on - perhaps she is enjoying having a little bit more power in the family too for once and this is a power flex.\n\nAll of that is irrelevant, however.

He should be able to watch a PG movie on his own if he wants to.", "YTA. you're an adult intervening because a child isn't the favorite anymore and you think he should be. fucking pathetic.", "YTA.

OP for not asking permission before taking his nephew after finding out this was supposed to be a family thing for sure. But at the same time, with his sister becoming his parents' (understandably) primary concern, it seems that his nephew is feeling neglected and OP was just trying to cheer him up so parents are also kinda the AH for ignoring one of their kids. The only ones who don't suck here are the kids.", "NTA. A 17 year old boy can't go see a movie without his 15 year old sister? That's dumb.", "ESH. You maybe should have talked to the parents. But I don\u2019t think that would do any good since the parents seem to be okay with bouncing around favorites. They created the problem with Shawn by favoring him and now favoring Sadie. If they can\u2019t treat all their kids equally they don\u2019t need kids. However I understand Sadie needs more attention now that she\u2019s sick but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that by favoring children they created the problem themselves. They\u2019ve also got to understand Shawn is 17 and technically almost an adult. Forcing him to wait to see something he wants to see because his sister can\u2019t go with him? That\u2019s going to create bad blood between siblings. The 17 year old may not want to see the movie with his little sister. Maybe he wants to go see it with friends. He\u2019s almost an adult and trying to force something isn\u2019t helping anything. I understand you did what you did to try to cheer him up so I can\u2019t blame you for that. I still say the worst offenders here are the parents for creating the whole situation in the first place.", "I guess the bigger problem here is that the parents think by making Shawn wait to watch the movie, they are making it even for Sadie. But is it really? He is a 17 year old and if he doesn't willingly wish to wait for his sister then all his parents have is 1 more year where than can MAKE him do such things. \n\nYou could have let him know how much it would mean to his little sister but no you simply made him think it's okay to have no consideration for his sister's feelings. \n\nEAH here except for Sadie!", "ESH you should have asked permission before taking him to see the movie, and your brother and sil need to realize that they are Already focusing basically all their time and attention on Sadie and they do in fact have other children who needs attention, care and Not to be constantly pushed back and put after Sadie. \n\nThat\u2019s a brilliant way of alienating siblings. \n\nWhich they likely have already caused to some degree as Shawn didn\u2019t have a wish to watch the movie with Sadie at all.", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t allowed to watch the movies without his sister? That\u2019s ridiculous. They are 2 separate ppl and don\u2019t have to do everything together.", "YTA. The only thing you did was teach Shawn that he could still be favorite and get his way,as long as he calls his Uncle. \n\nBeing equal isn't a punishment, it's the right thing and should have been corrected a LONG time ago,and this just undone any work they had/have done. \n\nYou had 2 choices,tell your nephew that he'd be okay and have him wait for after his sister's appointment or asked if you could take BOTH,you still managed to pick option 3,exclude you niece, like what has  happened for her entire life(at least by her Dad.)

Maybe he could learn to be patient with his sister who is in constant discomfort.\n\nAnd as I have mentioned above, if he is upset, the uncle aka OP could've asked him to speak with his parents and communicate his feelings to them.

The fact is that the parents banning a 17 year old from seeing a movie when he wants so he can  watch it with his sister is incredibly controlling. How is a 17 year old wanting to watch a movie being doted on or recieving special treatment. Maybe he is a superfan of mario which is why he wants to watch it early. If he was a 12 year old i could understand him needing to learn to be patient so he can watch it together with his family but this guy is 17. He should be allowed to watch movies by himself. The only reason OP had to take him is because his parents insisted he watch it with his sister who is acting entitled in needing him to watch it with her.", "It is not irrelevant. Shawn was asked to do ONE THING. ONE THING. To do a nice thing and watch a movie with his sister. Apparently he couldn't do that and decided to go around what his parents asked him to do to get his way. OP's sister has every right to be upset with them.", "So he wanst banned from seeing the movie, he was told to wait.
