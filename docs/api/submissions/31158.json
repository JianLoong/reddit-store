{"id": 31158, "submission_id": "17xh5ph", "title": "AITA for Thinking I Shouldn't Have to Cook if I am a guest for Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "My mom (55) invited both my boyfriend and I for Thanksgiving. I am 30 and my boyfriend is 33. My mom lives about 5 hours away, and we would have to drive Wednesday evening in order to be there for the holiday. While discussing the plans for Thanksgiving, my mom said she was ordering a turkey and was expecting my boyfriend and I to prepare a side each. I was taken by surprise because I have hosted her multiple times and never asked her to prepare any meals, and even when asking for help while cooking, for instance if she could bring me flour from the pantry...she laments that she is the guest and should be served and shouldn't have to help. I expected the same would go for us if we were guests, but I guess I was wrong? On top of that, she doesn't even have a place for us to rest, she said she has an air mattress that we can rest on during the 2 days we would be there in her one bedroom apartment. Every time she visits us, we prepare our guest room with nice bedding and make sure the bathroom is clean for her.\n\nI found out last night, that she corralled my grandmother (76)  into making desserts. To me it sounds like she is getting another stress free Thanksgiving while the rest of us have to cook. To make matters worse, she even expects me to cook at my home and then somehow pack the sides that we made and drive 5 hours to her apartment with them, because she doesn't want us to use her kitchen to cook. When I suggested that I just make the sides at her house because driving with perishable food would be a hassle, she said I would need to give her money so she could by the ingredients. After going through all of this, I rescinded my invitation to have her over for Christmas, because it is clear this is a one sided relationship in which she expects everything to be prepared for her. AITA for thinking her request is outrageous and selfish?\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nI have decided to just suck it up and make the sides. In fact, I will probably make some extra things such as gravy and cranberry sauce because my mom can be a bit forgetful at times. I also, rescinded my Christmas invite instead of just cancelling for Thanksgiving because my mom has already spent money on ordering a turkey. My issue wasn't having to bring something to the holiday, but rather my mom's hypocritical attitude that she shouldn't have to bring anything when I am the one hosting. My qualm about the one bedroom thing wasn't that my mom should magically come up with 5 star accommodations, bit that we have an option where she could just come over and we all have more room to move around.  4-5 people and a dog is a lot for a smaller one bedroom place. \n\nI will admit that I am mostly upset with my mom as well, because she has had a history of being selfish and always putting herself first above others. In addition to this she tries to always either borrow money or literally scavenge around our home to see what she can take home for herself (plates, cups, decorations, furniture pieces, etc.). On top of all of this I have had to somehow manage maintaining a relationship with her while she struggles with mental illness as well. All of this can be exhausting. I know for some this sounds like excuses, but it is just part of my side of the story. Overall, I will try to be grateful for what I have and just bring some already prepared food.", "created_utc": 1700233790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xh5ph/aita_for_thinking_i_shouldnt_have_to_cook_if_i_am/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom is definitely being an AH for not letting you cook there but many holiday hosts appreciate guests to bring sides or help with the meal somehow to help lighten the loads. Some sides can travel some can't but being upset that you've been asked to help contribute food is also an AH move. Kinda also sounds like you expected a magically larger space to stay at which isn't reality.

My cousins family does that thing where all the men pretend their wives aren't stressing and toss a football around or watch a game and no one brings dishes. So on and so forth.

She also was super excited for us to visit, but maybe she is just excited to have everything just the way she likes it.", "Also ordering premade sides or purchasing them if possible closer to where she lives also makes a lot more sense.", "It\u2019s okay to support from afar. Your compliance is misinterpreted and her behavior is narcissistic.\n\nShe is catching up on milestone achievements in her life, but her relationship with you and nurturing this doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority. \n\nShe has no problem continually demanding things from you and her mother- with no intention of reciprocating- the bare minimum being providing a full thanksgiving meal.", "*I am 30* \n\nYou don't sound like it. Get a hotel, help with the dinner and act as if you're visiting family, not completing some community service so you don't have to go to jail. How many people do you think are psyched to sleep on the air mattress, deal with relatives, have to cook and travel?\n\nYTA", "it's pretty normal to contribute sides. ESH.", "NTA - but she is older.  Why not just make something that doesn't need to cook (salad?) and bread and leave it at that?  Or if there is somewhere in your town to eat out just say lets go out to eat?  I'd book a hotel room as well.  Lets you rest without her walking in on you anyway.", "DONT GO", "Your mother is high maintenance and has trained everyone around her to just go along \"cause it's easier,\" or she's gonna throw a hissy fit. \n\nIf you're doing all the work anyway, tell her that you'd be more comfortable hosting at your own home. She can bring the turkey she ordered and that's that. \n\nYou are a grown adult and are allowed to say no. Your mother is using manipulation tactics because they work. Stop letting them work or learn to quit complaining when she does the same old behaviors.\n\nYou owe her less than nothing based on your replies, so the fact that you're even willing to acknowledge her existence is something.", "NTA - I would look into an inexpensive hotel for you and your BF to use while you're there instead of the air mattress.  That way everyone can have some privacy.\n\nAlso, don't forget that you can order/purchase pre-made food from grocery stores and other food retailers.  I know many places sell sides that you can just take and reheat.  The Honey-Baked Ham company has especially good ones, as does Publix (if you'll be in the south).\n\nMy aunt used to act like this.  She probably still does.  She'd get together with my parents and all of her siblings and their families and she would sit in the kitchen and gossip with everyone while everyone else prepped/cooked and she sipped a cup of coffee.  When we asked her to snap green beans, she said \"oh, I'm on vacation!\" and didn't lift a finger.  \n\nSo you're the only one who can decide if you want to have her come back or not.  I have a feeling that if you really do ban her it's going to be very impactful to your future relationship with her.  But if you do let her come for Christmas, I'd make it really clear over Thanksgiving that you expect her to be a FAMILY MEMBER when she visits, she is not a \"guest\".  She will be expected to help when she's staying with you.", "I have never gone to a meal I was invited to without bringing something. I think it's odd that you think that's odd. I wish my mom was still here to ask me to bring a side for her Thanksgiving dinner. You have the right to decline the invite instead of bitching about it. I won't even touch the fact that the accomodations aren't comfortable enough for 2 freaking days", "NTA this is why I keep my mom at arms length away. She is also a very selfish person and pulls the same crap.", "NTA \n\nJust get a can of cranberry sauce to chill in fridge and a bag of instant potatoes to microwave", "Just tell her she will be expected to abide by the same rules when she comes to your house for Christmas - prepare and cook 2 sides, bring them from home, do not use your kitchen, and re-heat them once she arrives. If she agrees, you'll do it now.", "It is a little inconvenient to bring a premade dish, but logistically it may make the most sense. Purchasing a ready cooked turkey also makes the most sense. It\u2019s faster to heat up than cook, and it guarantees it won\u2019t be dry like 98% of home cooked turkeys.  \n\nAs a large extended family, who gathers weekly and makes 6-8 dishes for dinner, oven space was a huge struggle for heating and cooking. Even with 3 dishes in the microwave and 3 on the stove timings can be difficult. I can\u2019t imagine doing that one some of the apartments kitchens that have a smaller stove than we have.  \n\nWe caved this last year an bought a hot box. It\u2019s been one of our favorite purchases since we can keep food warm and it alleviates so much stress. It\u2019s going to come in handy this year for the holidays especially with everyone in our family bringing dishes.", "No, I am 30. We just have different life experiences. Thanks for your opinion though, also I guess you didn't get around to reading the entire post with the update. Thanks for giving me your 2 cents though.", "For some reason, she is fixated on having us stay there with her. Also, I guess I could buy a salad. Last time I bought a salad, she nagged that I didn't make it correctly. Also, she already ordered a turkey, so she is dead set on having things a certain way. I think I just stressed myself out too much thinking about stuff, because I still have school work and actual work, and I need to find time to make food, because she seems intent on having us cook traditional thanksgiving sides. We decided on dressing and dirty rice. I also and going to the store to get gravy and cranberry sauce.", "It sounds like going there is stressful and just plain sucks. Why not just say, \"Hey, we're just not up for driving five hours to argue and have a crappy meal we made half of and drove all the way with, we're just going to stay home and have thanksgiving here.\"\n\nNTA. Why put up with a crappy holiday?", "I will admit, I don't like my mom, BUT we are family and I love her. I have had to deal with a lot that I am not able to fully put in this post when it comes to me and her. I posted an update though. Thanks for giving me another perspective though.", "OP, I would stop by a restaurant along the way and pick up two sides. Is there a Boston Market or a grocery store along your route that you could pick up a couple of sides, take a pit stop, and get back on the road? I think it's tough to travel with food for that many hours - food safety is a thing.", "The day you start cutting those obligations in your life out is the day you start being free.  It's amazing.  \n\nStart making your relationship with your mother on your own terms.  Invite her to specific, limited holidays and don't make a big to do for her.  Also, don't let her impose on you or take things from your apartment.  She's taking advantage of you."]}
