She came in a brown paper bag with a red ribbon my mom tied, apparently she found her in the gutter. Anyways. \n\nMy husband wants to have his family over for Christmas. I don\u2019t really like them that much but I don\u2019t mind them either. The issue is that his mom and sister are both really really allergic to cats. The first Christmas we were married they stayed over for two weeks, and I sent Raindrop to a cat boarding place. Last year my family stayed over so it was fine. This year he says it\u2019s his family\u2019s \u201cturn\u201d so Raindrop will have to go to boarding again, but I said I don\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s my last Christmas with her. He says I\u2019m being stupid and sentimental and his family\u2019s feelings are more important, because Raindrop won\u2019t mind going to boarding.

The dandruff is like little shards of glass.  It will be on hair that's shed and just naturally fall off the body on its own.  Every rug and item of furniture that the cat regularly spends time on will be saturated with the dandruff.  Every time someone walks on the rug or disturbs the furniture will cause an invisible cloud of dandruff to puff into the air.  If your home uses forced hot air or air conditioning, unless it has a grade A filter on it, it will cause every room in your home to be cat-dandruff infested.\n\nIt would require removing the carpets, plastic covering the furniture and putting air purifiers into every room and on your furnace/AC and letting those purifiers run for several weeks before it would be OK and even then his family may still have allergy issues.\n\nNTA, your house was \"fine\" 3 years ago because it was less infested with dandruff.  It now has 3 years of buildup and simply putting the cat into boarding isn't going to help.\n\nETA: you should probably do your own investigation into how to make your home hospitable for his family.  You may be able to super clean some rooms and put in air purifiers in those rooms and then restrict your cat to your bedroom (put a litterbox and food dish in there for it).", "NTA\n\n> Her name is Raindrop.\n\n> She came in a brown paper bag with a red ribbon my mom tied, apparently she found her in the gutter. \n\nRaindrop came from the gutter! \ud83d\ude0d", " *He says I\u2019m being stupid and sentimental and his family\u2019s feelings are more important, because Raindrop won\u2019t mind going to boarding*\n\nWhy are his family's feelings more important than yours?

You\u2019d have to wash all the curtains, clean out the ducts, shampoo all the couches, wash all of your clothes (yes the ones in the closet). \n\nHaving people with a cat allergy stay more than a couple hours in a home with a cat is insane.

Regardless of how much cleaning you do,  and if you even remove your beloved kitty from the home ( I have 2 ) there will still be some \"residue\" of kitty somewhere in your home that will trigger their allergies.

The pet died that very night. she didn't know that beforehand of course, but she did know it was going to die soon which is why she had wanted to cancel going to hubby's concert but she was guilted into going (or guilted herself into going).\n\nYour loyalty should be more to your cat, given her physical state, then to hubby's family that is in perfectly fine shape. your house, your rules. if you go to their's, you don't bring the cat. they come to your house, you decide about the cat. it is your cat's home, not theirs. see if they can get allergy shots, and otherwise invite them over next year but do not go against your instincts on this or you will regret it and resent him for it", "Awww NTA. \n\n\nBut your partner is a massive AH.

Non-cat people (or people who aren\u2019t super into pets at all) generally don\u2019t understand cat people. Sending the cat to boarding isn\u2019t a big deal to them. Not because they\u2019re bad people, they just don\u2019t understand the bond. They probably think boarding is no big deal since you did it last time and are not thinking of it from your perspective. However, you\u2019re not wrong for not wanting to board the cat. \n\nI think there are good ways to compromise. Can you thoroughly clean the house and can they all take allergy meds? Can the cat be constrained to one room/area of the house to avoid direct interaction?", "NAH\u2014I have a serious cat allergy and asthma, and short of washing every piece of furniture, all walls, and cleaning all the duct work I could never spend a night in a cat owner\u2019s house.

(And if that\u2019s the plan, is that going to work for them, or is being in the same house as a cat when they\u2019re there during the day going to be an issue?) Is there a less extreme way to handle this, like sequestering Rainbow in a room away from them? Also, if Rainbow goes to boarding, is *that* actually going to work for them? Some people with severe allergies would react even being in a house where a cat lives, even if said cat is not present at the time. (Residual hair, etc.)\n\nGenerally speaking, you need to be aware that an allergy is a big deal and his family deserves, at the very least, to have *information* about what will be going on with the cat. If you decide you\u2019re not willing to board it, you need to notify them ASAP, so they can decide not to come if that\u2019s the most appropriate course of action for them. YWBTA for sure if you did not address this issue in advance. As for whether YWBTA for essentially choosing your cat over your ILs\u2026 That depends on your (and your husband\u2019s) relationship with them, how often you are able to see them, *etc.*\n\nKeep in mind that your cat does not know that it\u2019s Christmas or care one way or the other.

I\u2019m 32 and he\u2019s 37. I have had my cat since I was in middle school, she\u2019s now 19 and has arthritis and kidney disease. Her name is Raindrop. She\u2019s my best friend I don\u2019t know I I\u2019ll live without her. This will probably be my last Christmas with her, and I got her as my Christmas present in 8th grade. She came in a brown paper bag with a red ribbon my mom tied, apparently she found her in the gutter. Anyways. \n\nMy husband wants to have his family over for Christmas. I don\u2019t really like them that much but I don\u2019t mind them either. The issue is that his mom and sister are both really really allergic to cats. The first Christmas we were married they stayed over for two weeks, and I sent Raindrop to a cat boarding place. Last year my family stayed over so it was fine. This year he says it\u2019s his family\u2019s \u201cturn\u201d so Raindrop will have to go to boarding again, but I said I don\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s my last Christmas with her. He says I\u2019m being stupid and sentimental and his family\u2019s feelings are more important, because Raindrop won\u2019t mind going to boarding. She likes the people there and has stayed several times. Am I really being selfish?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your cat is 19 years old with health issues - what if her time is limited?

They were 17 year old. Nothing would have made me send them to boarding or to live with someone else. I loved those cats dearly and miss them every day, and from how you describe Raindrop you feel the same. You will regret sending her to boarding - especially if the worst should happen or she needs to be taken to the vet etc.\n\nI would suggest you ignore your insensitive husband and talk with his family directly. Inform them of the situation, and ask them if you together can find other living arrangements for them. It would after all be the best solution since they won't risk an allergic reaction and you won't have to worry about Raindrop.\n\nI would also have a serious conversation with your husband about respect and how he has mistreated you (and Raindrop) in this.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

If lovely Raindrop is kept to your room and away from them, it sounds like their allergies could probably be managed with medication if being in the hoise around the dander was ok last time. And perhaps they could stay a shorter time, too, because a fortnight is a very long time!\n\nI do think your husband is insensitive and uncaring to try to minimise your feelings about Raindrop.

I'm a believer that pets are family and should never have to be displaced. Also, your home is full of cat dander so they are likely to have reactions whether you board your cat or not. It might've worked the first time they visited because you were newly married. Another possibility is to put your husband's family in a hotel or rental. They'll be much more comfortable and you can spend as much time with Raindrop as you can. I lost my cat last year at 19 and I'd give anything for extra time with her. At any rate, you're not being selfish. Raindrop is family and your feelings should matter more than your husband's family, quite frankly.

I have to do my best to make her last days good ones.  Does your husband's family understand that?", "Frankly, a friend of mine's vet said her cat who is the same age is too old to be boarded.

Why should poor Raindrop get kicked out of her home??\n\nAdd to that her health issues, it's super important she's with you so that you can give her her meds in the right dose at the right time. Boarding her would be a huge risk (no such issues for a young healthy cat). Plus the stress of the relocation on such an old cat could be very bad for her health.\n\nAnother person commented on how cat allergies work in relation to the dander she sheds and is infused into your house (sorry if it sounds bad, it's not, it's normal, and human skin cells are in that mix too. Yay life and all it's gross aspects \ud83d\ude06). So clearly they're exaggerating their allergies if they were fine with Raindrop simply being away last time. The allergens were still present!!

My cat is a shy boy, but *every single time* since I got him that I have been at the point of meltdown from stress, or have been in a meltdown, he has been there and followed me back and forth and stuck with me until I could accept comfort (which he then provided with purrs). I don't mean meltdowns over silly things like the wrong flavor of cake or not liking what someone else did that has no effect on me. I mean meltdowns from fearing the worst about rent money, to meltdowns from missing Mom, to a meltdown because the black cat I was caring for died from a shot wound, etc. There is nothing wrong with providing that same level of care, comfort, and loyalty in return, even with a cat.

If we have guests who want to stay with us and are allergic we will vacuum and deep clean the whole house, change the filters, and run air purifiers. The cats will still have run of the house but we will keep them out of the room you are staying in. If you are not staying overnight with us then we can keep the cats in one room for the  couple of hours that you are visiting but not longer than that.\n\nI take this approach because the cats deserve to be comfortable in their home and if you need to be completely away from cats in order to be comfortable that is your responsibility, not mine.
