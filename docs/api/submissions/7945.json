I am a relatively wealthy software engineer, and I have been trying to be financially responsible to save money for retirement and my children's college.\n\nAfter getting into a few medical TV shows, my wife has had an obsession with being a doctor and has been trying to convince me to pay for her applications to multiple medical schools. I think this is a stupid decision because my wife has been out of her communications degree for eleven years now, and she hasn't even taken the MCAT or anything like that. And if by some slim chance she gets into medical school, her tuition would wreck our finances and cause all sorts of problems with childcare.\n\nI tried explaining to her that this decision isn't realistic and suggested that she tried to do some other training like being a CNA to get a taste for the medical field first, but she got mad at me and said that I am stealing away her career aspirations. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Here's some context from my comments:\n\n\"I told her I would support her taking a smaller step into the medical field by becoming a CNA or nurse first, because it's more realistic for her to get that position and then advance to medical school. Also, I never forced her to stay at home and do childcare. I do a third of the housework on top of my job, and she asked to stay at home since we got married. She just recently changed her mind.\"\n\n\"I understand your concern. I don't overly restrict her spending, and any financial rule that we create that is imposed on her is also imposed on me. All large scale financial decisions, over $1000 have to be approved by both of us to occur. We both can buy necessities, and anything we want underneath $1000 occasionally. Since her 50 applications exceed $1000, we both needed to approve and I don't approve at all.\"\n\nEDIT 2: More context from relevant things I addressed in comments:\n\nAdditionally, my wife is refusing to take the MCAT despite my encouragement to do so first, because she thinks studying for it will slow down her timeline. And to those who are suggesting I agree to let her apply to fewer schools, she does not like that compromise. She insists she has to maximize her chances by applying to at least 50. She also doesn't like the compromise I offered  of trying another medical career first like nursing.", "created_utc": 1674347967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10i6gbi/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_go_to_medical_school/", "score": 6345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Retired nurse here. Ask her if she would apply to nursing school. If she has her bachelor's degree (any field, as long as it's a bachelor's degree), she can apply for a 16 month accelerated RN bachelor's program. She can always pursue more advanced degrees if she chooses. She'll soon see how television programs in no way ever reflect reality. There's a huge demand for nurses, but again, she will quickly realize why there's so many positions available. :/", "NTA. Tell her to prepare for MCAT. See how dedicated she is and I doubt she would pass. I have had friends fail and they were well prepared and just out of school.", "NTA\n\nThis is terribly unrealistic, and 50 applications is an enormous amount of money. With a communications degree, she likely doesn't even have the required coursework for medical school. Perhaps she should try the MCAT first, to see if she really wants to do this?", "NTA\n\nThis doesn't sound like a case of letting her go, the title makes it sound like you're literally forbidding it\n\nI just don't know if this is something she has a legit interest in or a \"I watched Scrubs and now I have a romanticized fantasy of being a doctor because I can do that too\" scenario\n\nI don't know the full process of becoming a doctor, but med-school is not easy to get into", "NTA!!\nI came here prepared to call you the AH based on the title but kinda sounds like she may be the AH. Her degree isn\u2019t science based so does she have any scientific background?\nMaybe just pay for her to take the MCAT so she understands this isn\u2019t the field for her. Side note: I have no idea how much the MCAT is, I know I only paid around 125 for GRE and as a software developer(no kids tho) this seems a small price to pay to nip this nonsense in the bud.", "INFO: Has she successfully taken and done well in all the pre-requisite courses for med school? (Eg organic chemistry, calculus, etc)", "NTA. If your wife had a communications degree 11 years ago, she might have to take some undergrad courses to meet the pre-req's before she can even start applying. If she starts on undergrad courses right now, she'll be in her late 40's before she becomes a doctor depending on what specialty she decides on. And will likely have to relocate for med school and residency. That being said, it won't cost that much time or money if she wants to take some undergrad physiology and anatomy undergrad courses, and go volunteer in a hospital (because TV shows are generally not realistic representations of reality).", "NTA. My wife won't let me go to the moon. Go figure. Seriously though, your wife should take the MCAT first then figure out how realistic those schools are and narrow it down a bit. Submitting 50 applications when you don't even know how competitive you'll be is insane. There's a lot of middle ground here and ways to be supportive without tilting at windmills.", "NTA. You\u2019re not telling her no, but your asking her to realistic. She might not even be eligible for med school with a communications bachelors and no MCAT. Maybe instead of nursing, ask her to take some college classes just to get a better sense of the field", "Sounds like OP\u2019s wife can afford 2-4 applications under the general financial rules they\u2019ve agreed on. If she can find that many schools that will consider her to have met pre-reqs in terms of her decade old class work, lack of MCAT, and (presumable) lack of patient care hours. Most schools require all of those, not sure if any require none of them. NTA for refusing to agree to any more than that number, given the lack of prep she is willing to put in. 50 would be wild even if she HAD put in a couple year\u2019s prep.\n\nThe tone of this comes across AHish, but that could be explained by reasonable frustration. Freedom to have dreams doesn\u2019t mean freedom to ruin the family\u2019s finances and spend tens of thousands of dollars on wishful thinking.", "NTA. As much as I believe everyone should be able to follow their career she\u2019s not being realistic. On top of money for school, you\u2019ll have to find someone full time to take care for he children. That\u2019s going to cut into your finances. And she\u2019s not going to be able to replenish that money quickly with her career. In addition\u2026she thinks TV shows depict what a medical career is like??? She needs to grow up. Looks so glamorous in tv. Nice ward rounds to show off what you studied. Sleepless nights look nice when you have a makeup artist on set fixing you up to continue to look good. They show you studying for 5 mins on screen and that\u2019s enough to pass exams. Yeah she needs to get some real world exposure.", "NTA. Your wife is in for a rude awakening if she is basing her decision on her watching medical TV shows. Your suggestion of taking the MCAT and/or getting her feet wet in a smaller position in the medical field first is reasonable. No med school is going to accept somebody with no MCAT and an 11 year old communications degree lol", "NTA, I\u2019m a pre-med student and there is so much work that goes into applying to medical school. Not just the MCAT, but also the required science coursework, the clinical experience, shadowing doctors, volunteering, research, recommendations, etc. Applying with little to none of these would be an insane waste of money. If she\u2019s really interested in a medical career she can start accumulating these experiences and apply later. People spend their entire undergrad years + gap years to become competitive applicants to medical/dental/PA/etc. school, and even then there\u2019s no guarantee of admission. Tell her to read the neurotic premed subreddit lol.", "NTA, she\u2019s needs more realistic expectations. Nursing school if affordable, not sure what part of the world your from though.", "NTA\n\nNot sure how you separate your finances but if you guys set aside individual fun money maybe she can spend that on her \u201cDream\u201d. Straight out applying for 50 different medical schools is nuts though.", "NTA. Just an FYI, she literally can\u2019t apply to medical school without meeting certain course requirements first (organic chemistry, bio, etc). There is also no credible medical school that will accept you without an MCAT, that\u2019s part of the process. \n\nIt sounds like she hasn\u2019t actually put much work into researching this. I would tell her that if this is ultimately her dream then you want to support it, but you need her to actually look into what is required to get into med school and how long it will take after to actually make money and become a doctor. She\u2019s going to have to take some basic weeder prerequisites first anyway. Maybe she will excel at them or maybe it will give her the reality check she needs. Grad school is tough, med school is the literal worst.", "NTA, but I have trouble believing she could do well enough in the pre-med course work and MCATs to get into Medical school.   Even getting into nursing school is tough these days", "The application fees are likely literally there to discourage spurious candidates like your wife. You can feel 100% secure in the fact that she will not be getting into any medical school with an academic record as you describe, and make your financial decisions accordingly.", "NTA.  This is a highly expensive sudden want of hers and the reality is far far different than TV shows.  She\u2019s not even used to a full time job, much less a physician\u2019s job in a hospital, residency etc, school studies and advanced degrees.", "NTA, her idea is completely ridiculous and not thought out at all. You're supportive of her entering the medical field in a sane way. She's not going to get into med school after being out of academia for 11yrs, especially without a degree in a related field.  If she was serious about this, she needs to research, study, talk to admissions counselors, and figure out what she needs to do.  How is she planning on paying tuition?  Who is going to handle childcare? \n\nI've changed careers a few times and I know what it takes. You don't need to take this seriously because she's not taking it seriously. \n\n50 applications? Insane. She has no idea what she's doing.", "NTA \n\n>my wife is refusing to take the MCAT despite my encouragement to do so first, because she thinks studying for it will slow down her timeline.\n\n >After getting into a few medical TV shows, my wife has had an obsession with being a doctor and has been trying to convince me to pay for her applications to multiple medical schools\n\nWhile worded poorly, your wife is being extremely unrealistic and unreasonable. Wanting to go to medical school because of ER and Grey's Anatomy is like wanting to become a cop because of Knight Rider. Medical school is expensive, difficult, and time-consuming, and your wife wants to do it because of television. She does not want to work her way up, she wants to start on third base.", "NTA but maybe she can volunteer at the hospital to see what the work is like. If not get an administrative job and see if she liked the environment. Medical school is a big commitment I think there should be a little more research like informational interviews before jumping in to that commitment. There is also adult scholarships. Sometimes hospitals pay for schooling if you work there.", "NTA. Perspective - the medical school associated with the hospital I work at accepts ~250 students each year.  They have 5-10k applicants and weed it down to 1500 to interview. From those 1500, they select the 250 they accept.  Competition to get in is ridiculously high.   This isn\u2019t just a daytime student hours either.  If by some miracle she was accepted, she would be in school for classes for 3 years and have to do rotations through the hospital.  Then a minimum of 3 years of residency.  If she wants to specialize, that\u2019s another 3-4 years AND includes being at the hospital overnight sometimes more than one night a week.  I wanted to be a doctor- before I had kids.  My husband told me I had to choose - kids or med school. I chose kids.  I don\u2019t regret it. I went to nursing school and love what I do. You have made reasonable suggestions for alternatives.", "Here's the thing, with a communications degree it's highly unlikely that she has the pre-requisites or academic coursework needed for medical school. It's doubtful she'll get in, but she does have the right to want to try.  If I was you, I'd consider the following:\n\n1) She studies and takes at the MCAT. You can afford that expense.  What I suspect is her score won't be that great, but maybe she'll surprise everyone. \n\n2) Also, have her fill out her FAFSA to see her financial aide options. Again, I doubt based on what you have said she'll qualify for any financial assistance.\n\n3) In the meantime, I'd use a site like Parchment and put in my GPA, school's I'd like to apply to, etc. This app tells you what your chances are of being admitted based on your data. When my girls applied to colleges it was spot on.  For example, UCLA was a 4% chance and my youngest didn't get accepted; however, other schools had higher matches and she got accepted to several of them.\n\n4) If her MCAT, GPA, etc. look good and if it appears she has the requirements to apply, I'd set a fair number of applications. For us, it was 10 schools for each of our girls; 50 is an insane amount of applications - to me it shows a lack of focus or realistic understanding of her options (but this is me). She could pick a lower tier school that's affordable, some state schools, and a couple dream schools and apply. Then, you wait and see. If she gets accepted, it's time to get real on finances. \n\n5) If she gets in, she can start applying for scholarships and financial aide. If after all this, you can afford it, then I'd say encourage her to attend and figure out a way. Commit to the first year and see how it goes.\n\nLastly, I think you have to find a way to support her and let her find out on her own way in her own time what her chances are of getting in to med school. For me, when I heard communications degree I saw an uphill climb. If her degree had been in the sciences, then I'd feel more optimistic. BUT, it's on her to figure it out.\n\nNAH - her for wanting to follow a dream; you for being concerned about finances, but \"letting\" her do something is a tell and it shows that you see yourself as being superior. You want to check that too.", "She'll be 40 ish before she can start paying off medical school loans. Such a big decision that both people need to be on board with it. NTA", "NTA. Your wife has the right to want to study and pursue her dream. However, you are right to suggest she should dip a toe into the medical field first as diving right in can ruin your financial stability.", "Your title \u201cnot letting my wife\u2026\u201d is poorly phrased and sounds very controlling. However, my fianc\u00e9 went to medical school (in the US), so I know how expensive that process is and agree it would wreck most people\u2019s finances. Furthermore, if she\u2019s sending out applications now then that is a complete waste because they will automatically be denied due to not fitting the criteria. If she has been out for 11 years and had a communication degree, she is probably lacking many prerequisites and the MCAT. Then she could send out applications. \n\nPerhaps a better solution would be having her shadow some physicians and start working on the prereqs. \n\nNTA for not wanting to spend a ton of money without fully thinking it through.", "Is she ok in general? Seems like more conversation is needed. Is this out of character? Could she be experiencing mania?", "NTA. To put it simply, your wife is delusional. Medical school is notoriously hard to get into. Nearly all medical schools require an MCAT score. Not to mention, a communications major would not have taken even half the science courses required. Plus, she's been out of school for over a decade? Most schools probably won't even look at course requirements outside of 5 years. She has literally nothing on her academic resume for schools to even look at her application. She'll get filtered out before an actual person even lays eyes on her application because there's so many requirements she won't even meet. Any considerations of applying is just a waste of money. If she wants to go to medical school, she literally needs to start from scratch.", "NTA \nShe should begin by looking at what prerequisites she has to have in her undergraduate work before she could apply to medical school. At bare minimum. She needs organic chemistry, biochem, biology, anatomy, physiology, and I have no idea how many more exist now.\n\n In other words, she's going to need 2 years of undergrad work at a minimum before she'll be ready to make the applications to medical school", "NTA. But. Let her apply.   She won\u2019t pass the MCATS and you\u2019ll be done with it.", "NTA, but let this play out.  If she is that far out with a non-STEM degree, she needs to probably do some pre-reqs and start work on the MCAT.   Let her pursue that to see how dedicated she is.  If she nails it, all the better and let her pursue it.   If she doesn't, let her see for herself when to quit and you aren't the bad guy.", "NAH\n\nWith a bachelor's degree in communications, your wife probably doesn't have the prerequisite undergrad courses to apply med school.  You're correct that it would be wasteful for your wife to just blindly apply.\n\nHowever, there's no real harm in telling her, \"I know you've been wanting to apply to med school.  You should look into the minimum requirements to apply to see what you would need to do.  For instance, you might need some Biology and Chemistry classes, and to take the MCAT.  If you need to take more undergrad classes, you could look into taking those at the local community college.\"\n\nOne of two things is probably going to happy en after you have that conversation:. Your wife will do the work required and kick butt and figure out how to become a doctor or, more likely, she will lose interest once she figures out how much work us required to become a doctor.  Your wife might even take a class or two before stopping, but also might not make it past the pipe dream phase. \n\nBut you lose nothing by supporting your wife in doing the work to figure out what's actually required.  And you wouldn't be the one to dash her dreams.\n\n(My husband and I have had this kind of conversation more than once in our 20+ year marriage.  There's been the \"way to make tons of money on stocks that no one else has figured out\" to which I said, \"You could have $X from our savings to prove out your idea, but no more than that if it loses money.\". And there's been multiple business ideas to which I've said, \"Great!  Let me know when you have a business plan for me to review.  We can talk about it more  after I've read the business plan.\". But I've always been supportive.  If things don't work out, it's because the business plan never gets written, not because I wasn't supportive.)\n\nSo, encourage your wife to develop her plan.  And if she says that some schools don't require the MCAT, ask what schools those are and what undergrad prerequisite classes she needs to take.", "NTA. She clearly doesn\u2019t understand how these kinds of things work. My guess is that she\u2019ll become obsessed with something like making illusion cakes or whatever in another month", "NTA.  Med school has pre-reqs.  She needs to do those first.", "Usually I'd be all about \"letting\" your wife do what she wants (and I only use that word because you did), because it's not on you to \"let\" her do anything. She's an adult, she can do what she wants. You're equals in a marriage, she doesn't need your permission.\n\nThat said, this one is a little different. Your wife has been out of school for a decade, and her undergrad degree was in communications of all things, not medicine or biology or chemistry or anything like that. Does she really think she's going to get into medical school? Sounds like she doesn't know shit about that area of science. And she wants to go to medical school because she watched some doctor shows on TV? Like... um.... no. Just, no. if she was a teenager who was still in school and about to go to college or starting out college and is in the middle of her educational path, that would be much different. But this doesn't seem like that sort of case. As a result, this sounds like a colossal waste of money and it's going to put a lot of stress on everyone. \n\nI'm not as concerned about the time away from home thing, because you're rich. Hire a nanny. She isn't handcuffed to the house any more than you are.\n\nI'm voting NTA on this one, but as I said, this seems like a different case than the usual misogynistic \"I'm not letting my wife do things because I'm the man and I'm in charge\" bullshit we usually get.", "NTA. Read the title and came here with guns blazing but, no. Your wife is not aware of all of the steps it would take for her to even *qualify* to submit an application to medical school. Your wife probably doesn\u2019t even have all the prerequisites necessary to apply for nursing school with her background, much less medical school. It would take a ton of work and time to accomplish that. It\u2019s nice that she feels excited about something but both you AND your wife already made certain lifestyle choices, namely having a family, that don\u2019t allow space for her to both train for, and later have, an extremely intensive career without massive changes to your family. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable for you to not be okay with those changes. Listen, I wanted to be Meredith Grey just as much as the next binge-watcher, but we gotta keep things in perspective!", "NTA. The jump from SAHM to medical school is HUGE. Support her dreams but they need to be realistic. It isn't realistic to expect you to support her going to school for years on end, residency, etc. The agreement right now was that she's the SAHM and it needs to be a reasonable agreement to change. This isn't reasonable; she's asking you for a full ride to college.", "NTA. If she hasn\u2019t taken the MCAT and has a non STEM degree and it\u2019s been that long since she\u2019s been in school, she\u2019s being completely unrealistic. She needs to try the MCAT or apply to maybe 1 school and get rejected first. Medical school is 4 years (in the US) plus 2-5 years residency plus maybe a 1-3 year fellowship as well. Plus the 2-8 years residency/fellow pays peanuts so on top of the time commitment you\u2019d be getting in the hole financially. Also, majority of US doctors who started med school with 0 student debt have loans in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Tuition is no joke.\n\nETA: residents often work 80+ hours a week and often make less than minimum wage when all is said and done. Medical school is the easy part, is she aware of this?", "Hi there. First of all to get into any medical school you need a competitive MCAT score depending on DO or MD ( at least 498, if you have a 3.8+ GPA ). Also all medical schools require pre reqs such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, physics and so on. I doubt she has taken any since her major was communications. If she wants to go back to school, take the pre reqs and then take MCAT and be ready in three years then it is plausible. Time is not on her side nor is the gravity of the competitiveness of getting accepted. My buddy is in medical school right now at age 39. I wish you both best of luck.", "NTA. That's a Huge thing to jump into. Starting by ensuring you actually like the work and the field as a CNA, or can handle the amount of study required by taking the MCAT is way more reasonable.", "NTA but the way you word a lot of this is concerning. Not \u201csupporting\u201d my wife would sound better. \u201cLetting\u201d sounds very controlling from the out set.", "INFO: How old are your children?  How expensive are the next steps with applications and the MCAT and prereq coursework?", "NTA, you gave her an alternative. She didn't like it. She is hoping to do something realistically impossible. She came at you with her head in the clouds, and you planted her ass firmly back on the ground, it is called tough love.", "INFO:\n\nIs applying to medical school even the first step in the process? Could she say study for the MCAT first?", "NTA. \n\nBut if you want, you can try researching the courses and lesson teached in med schools and buy her a books or two. \n\nIf she likes it, is passionnate about it and is able to get to learned what is asked, maybe give her a chance.", "NTA. I have a marketing degree and decided to go back to school for a medical career. She is nowhere near where she needs to be for a doctor (or even a CNA at this point). I took all the pre med classes at community college (they are difficult classes) before taking any entrance exams. You need a very solid foundation before pursuing a medical career. Instead of literally throwing away money on med school applications that will 100% be rejected. Suggest she take the pre med classes (chemistry, microbiology, anatomy/physiology, organic chemistry) she will actually need before applying. If she does well in those classes, THEN, she can take a MCAT prep course. Your wife's current plan is ridiculous and a complete waste of money. She would not only be wasting money, but also the admissions officer's time. Has she even bothered to look up the prerequisites she needs for med school?", "It sounds like your wife is having a bit of a mid-life crisis. You both should probably consider therapy to deal with underlying issues. It\u2019s an unrealistic goal if she\u2019s not prepared to do the pre-requisite work. If she\u2019s unwilling to budge from her idea, you could go along with her plan to apply, but I think you would need to be prepared to support her for the inevitable let down after receiving the rejection letters.", "NTA but your phrasing sucks. \"not letting\" gives controlling vibes. \", Not supporting unrealistic goals\" would've been a better way to phrase", "After reading your comments, NAH. It sounds like maybe she's just genuinely uncertain of what medical school entrance entails. Maybe find an admissions counselor to help your wife get a better picture of what a competitive application would entail. Might help if you're not the one telling her that she realistically can't get in. \n\nThe idea about her doing a different medical position is also a great idea, but I do get why she might have taken that as you saying she's not good enough to be a \"real\" doctor. Again, hooking her up with some good resources and support people who understand the medical school system might help there too.", "INFO:\n\nAre you not \"letting\" her or are you just not subsidizing her? These are two very different things.", "NTA depending on how you approached it. If you actually said what you posted you are an AH. Rather than telling her what you think, approach it in an open, positive way but ask some questions. I expect she is tired of being a SAHM and would like to pursue something fulfilling outside of that. Maybe she could start by doing some volunteer work at a local hospital or take some intro classes at the local college. Compromise on having her apply to a few schools, so she can understand the requirements.

You need prereqs, volunteer experience, MCAT, not to mention that medical tv shows are a horrendous misrepresentation of medicine. \n\nI hope she also has some idea of how grueling medical training is. No matter what your field, it\u2019s basically a seven year minimum commitment. I have several loved ones who are in various medical fields at various levels. Let me say this clearly - I would never be able to do what they do. \n\nThe training programs alone leech away your soul - you do not sleep. You eat poorly, whenever you can. You sometimes work 12+ hr days for 14 days in a row and then get two days off, and then do it again the next week. You have extremely limited time to do anything outside of your job during training. You absolutely have to LOVE medicine to get through it. You have to love trying to help people as they naysay you, cry, yell, have mental breakdowns, occasionally try to physically attack you. You face the realities of people from walks of life you may have never encountered and see how unfair life can be. You have to emotionally get through the number of people you cannot save no matter what you and your team do. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how they do it. \n\nYour wife needs a reality check.", "NTA. OP, another thing to note is that a lot of med schools require applicants have an understanding of what being a doctor entails. Normally this is done through shadowing other doctors, but I had friends who did it working as EMTs, nursing assistants, etc. Some schools require a significant amount of hours spent in the field. You\u2019re already on the right path encouraging her to try a related but more accessible health career, and in fact that will probably end up being essential to her applications if it goes that far.", "NTA\n\nMaybe she will find some new tv shows soon.", "NTA. There is clearly a big gap in her education that spans 11 years including her initial BS degree not even being in a STEM field.

Those classes can take a few years before she can even apply to Med school!", "When she told you she passed her prerequisites, are you sure she knows what the actual prerequisites are? It would be bizarre in the extreme for a communications major (or any non-bio or chem major) to take all the med school prerequisites unless she had been planning on med school at the time. You don\u2019t take two semesters of organic chemistry as a fun elective.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being completely honest with you about pre reqs. Plus, if she just passed, there\u2019s no way she\u2019d pass the MCAT, or get a high enough score to be considered a viable med school candidate.\n\nPlus, she needs to know that those expire after a certain amount of time.", "Even in the Caribbean you need biology and chemistry.", "It's not that she \"probably wouldn't get in.\" There is no way in hell that she will get in. You're 100% safe here. Let her fail. No need for you to be the one who tells her what she can't do. Let her try. It will keep her from fighting you on it.", "Nursing isn't a step into becoming an MD, it's an entirely separate pathway for a very different job.", "Phlebotomy is also a good and quick way into the medical field.", "That is not a good solution. Why would you want to add 4 more years of nursing school if she ends up going to med school.

But you\u2019re N T A for considering the financial implications of it.  \n\nThere is a lot that doesn\u2019t make sense here, though:  \n\n1) If she wants to go to med school, jumping in with applications is just a waste of time and money.  If she\u2019s planning on going to school in the US, she needs the MCAT.  And she needs a good score.  Suggest an MCAT prep course.  You don\u2019t just walk into a full-day (expensive) standardized exam with zero prep.  It will also be a litmus test for how she might handle the rigors required of med school.  If she can\u2019t handle a simple test prep class, she\u2019ll never handle med school. \n\nTangentially, I don\u2019t think a communications major would have the advanced science classes required.  Unless it was a science communication program.  Maybe? \n\n2) Med school applications are not $20 a pop.  They\u2019re more like $100-300 a pop.  And they\u2019re a LOT of work.  You don\u2019t just throw them out into the wind hoping one will stick.  You select a few specific programs that your strengths and experience will give you an advantage for acceptance, and that focus on your interests.  I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s looking at that suggests 50 applications are needed, or that 50 applications will be a reasonable amount of work to complete. \n\nAside from the above nonsense, the suggestion that she find an intermediate stepping stone is reasonable, but you should look into the difference of actual job duties between CNA and one of the many varieties of nursing credentials.  A bachelor\u2019s would put her well beyond the prerequisites for a CNA, which is also a job very limited in actual medical involvement.  It\u2019s mostly assist with bathing, dressing, feeding, cleaning, type duties.  But a couple years of working as a CNA would be much better to have on a med school applications than her current \u2026.checks notes\u2026\u2026nothing.  \n\nBeyond the financial considerations, you\u2019ve not mentioned the logics of pursuing a career as a physician.  \n\nShe\u2019s looking at a year (at least) of prep work and applications.  Then, even if she gets into a *local* school, it\u2019s going to be absolutely constant work.  Especially if she\u2019s never done core science classes.  That\u2019s a totally different type of studying from her communications degree.  She\u2019s looking a full work day\u2019s worth of classes, then many hours of study at home in the evening and on weekends to keep up.  Just for the first 4 years.  Your oldest will be 10, at least.  After she graduates, it\u2019s on to 2-4 years of residency working 60-80 hours a week, with consecutive days of not even coming home.  (Again, depending the specialty.)  Your kids will be teenagers by the time she even starts a career.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s IF she gets into a local school.  She\u2019ll very likely, need to move for 4 years of school, then probably move again for residency, depending on what field she wants to pursue.  There is absolutely no guarantee she\u2019ll get accepted to local programs at either point, so you need to discuss if your career would allow you to follow her\u2026.wherever. \n\nI get that you view this as a whim, and maybe it is.  But you can support her exploring the possibilities without being an AH about it.  If it is some romantic notion on her part, it\u2019ll pass.  If she\u2019s the type to dig her heels in just because someone told her \u2018no,\u2019 it won\u2019t. (And that personality trait would serve her well as a doctor.) But your support in her dipping her toes in and you NOT having a \u201ctold you so\u201d attitude if she changes her mind will be essential if you want to keep this marriage.", "Maybe she has ADHD, I do the same things where I become extremely obssessed with something and normally never follow through or finish said obsession. I will also develop hobbies and spend an astronomical amount of money and again never really finish them or fully commit to them. I just got my nursing degree and I agree she should start as a CNA then PCA then RN then doctor or nursing practitioner. I did this and it allowed me to see it was more then just a whim. I also recommend she goes to therapy, because that can heavily influence her life if it hasn\u2019t already and set her up to be disappointed with people if they don\u2019t say yes.", "I don't recommend starting with nursing -- very different role and career track (and can also be competitive).

It makes her feel like you aren't supporting her.\n\nThe one I would definitelly focus on is the MCAT requirement.  She can even talk to counselors and what not and get the confirmation she needs to take that test.\n\nIf she is type this would work on, maybe have her take the test without prep.

Nursing is an entirely separate profession from doctoring. One doesn't lead into the other. Nurses can get a Masters or Doctorate in Nursing, and become a Nurse Practitioner, but you don't go from CNA to Nurse to Doctor. A BSc in Nursing won't help her progress to being a doctor.\n\nNurses get into the nitty gritty hands on, and a lot of what you see on TV is what nurses actually do. There's a lot of diversity in the profession, so you can transition towards a lighter duty career if you need to (such as towards retirement). This might appeal to your wife, if she's getting her idea of the medical field from TV. \n\nBut don't assume you can go from nurse to doctor. It's simply not how it works. You'd have some of the same prerequisites to get admitted to the program, but you'd more or less have to start over from scratch if you wanted to change professions.\n\nI'm sorry to say that most nursing schools won't accept university classes that are over ten years old. I doubt medical schools will either. \n\nTL;DR: nursing and being a doctor are completely different", "Then she needs to be realistic and grow up   No one applies to that many.", "I still don\u2019t understand why her goal is to apply to 50 schools, is that the minimum requirement to join medical school", "Lmao then she needs to grow up", "I certainly don't think there are 50 that would let her apply without it.", "Shoot, just buy her an MCAT test prep book so she can see how unrealistic this entire plan is.", "Then she needs a reality check.", "We wouldn\u2019t even see it because she\u2019s missing the MCAT so her application would never even be complete.", "Yeah, I'm very confused by the idea of starting with nursing school, as if Doctor was a promotion from Nurse.

Then there\u2019s the reality of healthcare in America, it\u2019s good to know if you want to take all of that on.

I have a PhD in an unrelated field, but I teach a lot of pre-med students. I\u2019m basically brought to tears when I hear how much work they have to do, and how much pressure they\u2019re under.

Then if she decides she does in fact want to do this the \u2018right way\u2019 and take the classes and do the extracurricular experiences required, and put it in the work to apply to med school, she will have ruined her chances because the MCAT score is pretty much permanent and will tank her application. \n\n\n\n\nI suggest doing something that may open her eyes to the reality of the medical school experience, that does not leave a permanent transcript behind.", "NTA.

If your wife is seriously interested in the medical field, she should talk to a counselor at a nearby college about career ideas & how to get there. You should keep in mind that even a BSN or other RN level nursing school would have upfront downsides, both in terms of cost & time required, but the eventual rewards of a career as an RN would pay off for your family.

Happy to report though I am now presently 32 and actively in my 2nd year as a pharmacy student. Jumped in as head first as I could. OP's wife absolutely could go be a doctor if she wanted at her age. But she would definitely need to take some pre-reqs I 100% guarantee she doesn't have. And she has to take the MCAT. Period. She cannot move forward without those. And med school is still hard to get into. It's not a guaranteed, so you can't just half ass those parts. \n\nI think OP is being reasonable in trying to compromise. He's right, it's very expensive and difficult to become a doctor. If she's serious, it can be done. But I also get that she is deeply unsatisfied with her life presently and is looking for what might be a new direction she wants. Right now, medical shows look great, so she thinks it might be the thing. Of course, as I suspect most of us know, real life healthcare is nothing like the shows. I think OP might want to help his wife figure out a direction that will fullfill her and not leave her disappointed (if she fails) and stressed (doing any of it).", "I\u2019m a clinical pharmacist in a hospital so I work with a variety of doctors every day. You could not pay me enough to switch places with them. In this day & age it\u2019s just such a thankless job. So much stress for not nearly enough pay.", "Same lol. I really wanna ask OP but I\u2019m trying to be respectful.", "I think there could be several different possibilities. It\u2019s possible she actually wants to go to med school and is being naive as well as not taking the initiative to research the process. However, it also strikes me as a possibility that she wants to return to work but is afraid of failing. Or that she feels like she\u2019s failed by not having career.  Therefore, perhaps she is subconsciously setting up a scenario for failure or as an excuse why she doesn\u2019t have a career.  I think op and his wife need more in-depth conversations.", "I laud you for your career change. You approached that change with the diligence that is required.  However, op\u2019s wife is not.  Her insistence on applying without looking into med school carefully makes me think there\u2019s potentially a different problem here.", "Yeah, my uncle was valedictorian and had to go all the way out to Kansas for vet school because it was the only place that accepted him. That was in the 70s, I'd imagine it's even more competitive now.", "Thank you. I agree about OP's wife. It can be done, but you really have to apply yourself and work your ass off. Her comment about not wanting to waste time studying is telling, because studying is all you do when you hit medical school. She needs to do a lot of research, like what these school require (like classes and GPA and \n MCAT scores). Otherwise, blindly applying to that many schools is just a waste of time and money. I think there is something deeper wrong with her. She needs a change, direction, but she is trying to jump head first into an unrealistic (at this time) option. I hope he is able to help guide her to a path she wants and will excel at. I don't think being an MD is the path she thinks it is, and ultimately the path she wants.", "YTA in how you are handling this. The correct move is to encourage her and get her in contact with someone at admissions at a medical school to break down to her what she is actually trying to get into. Having a professional tell her yes, you need to take the MCAT is different than you telling her. Having someone in admissions let her know her degree in no way translates to medical school means more than you telling her that. However, you are mostly TA because you are squashing her dream. Let her try. There is nothing to gain by keeping imposing restrictions on her other than making yourself the scapegoat in why she never did anything with her life professionally.

Additionally, Med school is really hard, if she can\u2019t do well on the MCAT how will she do well for medical test? I have taken stem tests, they are not easy.\n\nI\u2019ll also add there are \u201cmedical\u201d programs that don\u2019t require the MCAT or anything and sketchy medical schools(especially in the Caribbean, there are good ones there but it\u2019s way harder regardless) that don\u2019t but you won\u2019t get into residency let along become a doctor with those.  At best you become a pseudo doctor maybe doing first aid or chiropractic stuff(know a guy who went to a school like that, wasn\u2019t a true medical degree, he became more like a self help person with massages, athlete ica and vitamins) at worst you lose your money for nothing.\n\nMedical school is hard, and it\u2019s followed by a just as hard residency.

I chose to be a doctor and I knew what I was walking into. I almost cried this week but that\u2019s because I was overwhelmed with a situation a first week doctor rarely gets put in. Tbf I\u2019m in a rural area and I was prepared for this potentially happening and I only worked 4 hours overtime so that\u2019s pretty good. Showers are good places to cry in fyi.", "In the U.S. the pay for doctors is generously reasonable. \n\nBeing a doctor - at hospitals especially - can definitely be grueling work and long hard hours. But the doctors definitely get paid handsomely for it, as they should.", "I searched for a comment with the word \"delusional\" because that pretty much nails it.  Her degree was in communication so she had no hard science classes that would prepare her for med school.  Somehow she is so smart she will be able to skip the hard science classes that all pre-med students take and doesn't need to take the MCAT.  This is **pure lunacy on her part**. OP has been more than fair by suggesting alternatives to ease into a career in the medical field.\n\nI honestly wonder if his wife isn't somewhere on the BPD spectrum cooking up a cockamamie plan like this.  \n\n**OP needs to take steps to protect his finances and do whatever he can to get them into couples therapy, NOW.**  \n\nNTA", "Husband is a physician and he says the TV show that has the most realistic portrayal of med school/ residency/ practicing was Scrubs lol", "Oooh Ive seen every episode of Supernatural. Brb gonna go fight demons and monsters!", "NAH\n\nI am going to say N-A-H because of the lack of MCAT and, presumably, medical school prerequisites.\n\nIf she had those lined up, I would think very differently.\n\nHer age should not be a factor. 35 may not be the median age for medical school in the US, but it is far from unheard of.", "If she thinks she needs to apply to 50 schools to \"increase her chances\" of getting into medical school, she already knows she's not getting in. At least subconsciously.\n\nThat's an obscene number of applications.\n\nShe refuses to even study for the MCAT. If I were OP, i would not take her seriously in this at all. This is not how a serious person pursuing a dream acts...", "The average is 30 schools for the first part of the apps so 50 isn\u2019t totally unreasonable if you\u2019re under qualified and casting a wide net. But without the reqs and mcat, letters of rec, clinical/ research experience she has no shot", "Yeah there\u2019s no way - I was literally a biology major and didn\u2019t have the prerequisites when I checked them out after I graduated\u2026", "Hahahaha I didn't realize this was an ADHD thing for so long. I have learned so many hobbies that I have bought tons of supplies for and then just never continued with.", "You can get a doctorate in nursing. The ceo of the hospital I'm employed at has one.

Those classes alone would not only test her commitment to these dreams but can usually start weeding people out fairly early on", "Why does that cost money at all? What are you paying for? Also do schools really require an application fee where you live, and why?", "Like half of the prereqs are chemistry classes.", "Current PA here who is a former tutor/coach for med school applicants. I can offer some insight into the path she'd need to take for both. \n\nBut first, I'm a little concerned about how you are describing her recent goals, especially this need to apply to 50 school s. Is this very out of character for her? Has she been sleeping well? This could easily be a 'mid-life crisis ' of someone that isn't satisfied with where they are in life, but I'm also a little worried she could be having a manic episode. If she has been sleeping very little, or her speech is very very fast in a way that's different, I'd recommend you seek medical care as soon as possible.\n\nFor what she needs to do for either PA school or med school, she'll need:\n\n 0) pick schools nearby she wants to go to, and research their requirements \n\n1) undergrad classes\n\n2) medical field experience\n\n3) testing and applying\n\nSo realistically, she's married, she has a family. These plans are going to take ~5 to 10 years of her life, I assume she does not plan on moving away from you her family. If she does, you should be looking at counseling services not reddit (not a joke, please do that anyway honestly. Something is going on and it would help her to talk it through with a professional). Check the programs near you, make a checklist, do those things.\n\nShe first needs to take pre-req classes at the undergrad level. Bio, chem, biochem, anatomy, etc. Check the med school and Pa school programs nearby and see what classes they require. Even if she has taken those classes before, she will likely need to retake them as she graduated a long time ago and has not been active in a field that would suggest she's retained that knowledge. \n\nConcurrent to taking undergrad classes, she'll also want to gain experience in the field. For PA school this will need to be patient care hours and needs more hours than medical school. PA typically likes applicants to be more experienced and capable since the program is so much shorter.\n\nShe'll probably need GRE for PA school, will definitely need MCAT for med school. She'll want to wait until she's through the undergrad classes to take those though, to maximize her score.", "Yea I got diagnosed last year as an attempt to record my lectures in uni, and turns out I actually had adhd. It explained why I talk so much (to the point of over sharing), why drinking caffeine doesn\u2019t really affect me, my list of hobbies and new found excitement, I honestly left that meeting with my psychiatrist a bit shocked lol. ADHD in women used to be and still is diagnosed later in life and missed in childhood because like so many other things we have different signs and symptoms and it\u2019s missed very commonly.", "To clarify, applying isn't going to be \"over $1000\" in the sense that it might be 1200 or something.  It's going to be more like 2-3k.  $1000 is just their threshold.", "I agree. She should see if she can volunteer/shadow in a hospital first if she\u2019s intent on becoming a physician", "Yeah I doubt a communications major was taking a bunch of o-chem just for fun lol", "> she could explain extenuating circumstances (childcare responsibilities) for not taking the exam for schools that require it\n\nFucking amazing. They will laugh at her.", "Honestly trying to say she was too busy to complete a basic requirement for admission is only going to hurt her application more. If she can\u2019t make time to study now, why would things change if she was admitted?", "They'll toss her application without reading anything. \n\nWhat she's insisting on is so detached from reality that I think you should seriously consider having her see a psychiatrist. She might be experiencing a manic episode.", "There are only a couple dozen med schools that don't require an MCAT score for admission, and several are EAP programs, which would require being admitted to, and graduating from, undergrad at those same schools. There's no way a program will give her resume a look unless she takes the MCAT, and if her undergrad degree is in comms, I doubt she has the prereqs she'd need. She'd probably have to do a post bac first.", "It *is* possible. My cousin had an MBA working in international business, and decided to go to med school after his brother had a very rare medical situation and he got interested. He was married and I don't remember the exact timeline but during the course of med school, residency, fellowship, etc he had 8 kids.\n\nThat said his wife is a nurse anesthetist, his father is a dentist, our grandfather and great grandfather were doctors and our uncle is one\u2026 so he was very aware of the realities/demands of the field and getting through a professional doctorate program. Also probably not much difference in work hours from his previous career anyway. But it can be done and he\u2019s now an orthopedic surgeon.\n\nIf OP\u2019s wife was really serious she would start with taking pre-req classes and study for the MCAT though.", "She's said she does even want to take the MCAT because she doesn't want to waste her time studying, it will slow her down. That's where a compromise career like nursing sounds better. She doesn't seem to want to do the work, so she should do a similar job with fewer prerequisites.", "I worked in a clinic part time in undergrad and all the doctors would offer me this advice and I'd always be like, 'Not planning on it!' because they were all so miserable.", "She should watch ER. That show made me wonder why anyone gets into the medical field at all. Lmao", "It\u2019s lupus", "Right, so the easiest solution is let her try and watch her crash and burn and just cost yourself the money and your wife\u2019s self esteem.\n\nReasonably I think OP needs to push the studying for the test, because as others have said her dreams aren\u2019t unrealistic, it\u2019s just the way she\u2019s choosing to pursue them and when.\n\nShe\u2019s in a hurry, as if becoming a doctor won\u2019t take 6-8 years of additional schooling for her to begin with.", "Organic chemistry and physics killed a lot of pre-med dreams at my college.", "It\u2019s never lupus.", "I was thinking this as well.... That OP's wife is pursuing a ridiculous path that she has no chance so she can claim to the \"victim\" of unfair admission practices, or whatever.\n\nThe fact that OP's wife won't consider CNA or RN training to get a realistic view of medicine, not just from TV drama, tells me this is a fantasy.", "> It\u2019s possible she actually wants to go to med school\n\nShe probably does, but people get half-baked ideas in their head all the time and it falls to other people to talk sense into them about what's actually feasible. That gets reversed back anytime the person doesn't like the answer as controlling or gatekeeping. OP is already fallen into that trap by repeating the phrasing she no doubt used on him \"he's not allowing her\".\n\nReality is that she's not approaching this in a serious way, but now it's framed as a man controlling and/or gaslighting her so she can cognitively dismiss the holes in her plan.", "When you consider that a lot of them are $400k+ in debt for med school though, their paycheck really isn't high enough.", "> Just wanted to point out, people that attend medical schools that don\u2019t require the MCAT (Caribbean schools) have a significantly harder time matching into residency, if they do so at all. If she wants to go down this path with a realistic chance of becoming a doctor she needs to understand how difficult it really is\n\nHeck even most Caribbean schools require the MCAT, they just are willing to accept a sub 500.", "But she\u2019ll have to take prereq courses which is hella expensive", "I hadn't even thought of that, such a good point. Is she applying to medical school in the Carribean? Those are easier to get into, but the commute is killer lol", "Let\u2019s move past the application issue for the moment. Has she explained to you what the plan is if she actually gets in? She won\u2019t, but she obviously thinks it\u2019s a possibility somehow. Is she planning to relocate your whole family or leave you and the kids? Does she think she\u2019ll be able to take classes online?", "The only place that will accept her is one of the fake Caribbean schools where she'd end up with 300k in loans.", "Not entirely true. They acctually like if you get non stem degrees because your a more unique candidate. Issue is you usually have to tack on several more semesters to get all the more reqs", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she has the prerequisite classes though, if her degree is not in STEM and she wasn\u2019t planning to go to medical school back when she was in college.", "Assuming they are in the US, the only place that might take her without an MCAT score is a Caribbean school. Every US-based school requires an MCAT and an application isn't considered complete without at least listing a date to take one, so applying would be a complete waste of time and money for her at this stage. There were a few exceptions during the height of COVID, but those evaporated pretty quickly. It's an absolutely essential step in the process, not a waste of time. \n\nI more wanted to point out that you absolutely can go to med school without a STEM degree. I and many of my classmates are doing it. A STEM degree isn't a guarantee of success and a non-STEM degree is certainly not a guarantee of failure. The days of only getting into med school with a biology major have long since passed.", "I've heard that one is one of the more realistic depictions of a hospital.", "ER...  Yea.  It was a depressing fucking show that launched Clooney's Career.  But I never missed a week"]}
