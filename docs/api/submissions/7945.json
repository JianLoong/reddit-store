I am a relatively wealthy software engineer, and I have been trying to be financially responsible to save money for retirement and my children's college.\n\nAfter getting into a few medical TV shows, my wife has had an obsession with being a doctor and has been trying to convince me to pay for her applications to multiple medical schools. I think this is a stupid decision because my wife has been out of her communications degree for eleven years now, and she hasn't even taken the MCAT or anything like that. And if by some slim chance she gets into medical school, her tuition would wreck our finances and cause all sorts of problems with childcare.\n\nI tried explaining to her that this decision isn't realistic and suggested that she tried to do some other training like being a CNA to get a taste for the medical field first, but she got mad at me and said that I am stealing away her career aspirations. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Here's some context from my comments:\n\n\"I told her I would support her taking a smaller step into the medical field by becoming a CNA or nurse first, because it's more realistic for her to get that position and then advance to medical school. Also, I never forced her to stay at home and do childcare. I do a third of the housework on top of my job, and she asked to stay at home since we got married. She just recently changed her mind.\"\n\n\"I understand your concern. I don't overly restrict her spending, and any financial rule that we create that is imposed on her is also imposed on me. All large scale financial decisions, over $1000 have to be approved by both of us to occur. We both can buy necessities, and anything we want underneath $1000 occasionally. Since her 50 applications exceed $1000, we both needed to approve and I don't approve at all.\"\n\nEDIT 2: More context from relevant things I addressed in comments:\n\nAdditionally, my wife is refusing to take the MCAT despite my encouragement to do so first, because she thinks studying for it will slow down her timeline. And to those who are suggesting I agree to let her apply to fewer schools, she does not like that compromise. She insists she has to maximize her chances by applying to at least 50. She also doesn't like the compromise I offered  of trying another medical career first like nursing.", "created_utc": 1674347967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10i6gbi/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_go_to_medical_school/", "score": 699, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Retired nurse here. Ask her if she would apply to nursing school. If she has her bachelor's degree (any field, as long as it's a bachelor's degree), she can apply for a 16 month accelerated RN bachelor's program. She can always pursue more advanced degrees if she chooses. She'll soon see how television programs in no way ever reflect reality. There's a huge demand for nurses, but again, she will quickly realize why there's so many positions available. :/", "NTA. Tell her to prepare for MCAT. See how dedicated she is and I doubt she would pass. I have had friends fail and they were well prepared and just out of school.", "NTA\n\nThis is terribly unrealistic, and 50 applications is an enormous amount of money. With a communications degree, she likely doesn't even have the required coursework for medical school. Perhaps she should try the MCAT first, to see if she really wants to do this?", "NTA\n\nThis doesn't sound like a case of letting her go, the title makes it sound like you're literally forbidding it\n\nI just don't know if this is something she has a legit interest in or a \"I watched Scrubs and now I have a romanticized fantasy of being a doctor because I can do that too\" scenario\n\nI don't know the full process of becoming a doctor, but med-school is not easy to get into", "NTA!!\nI came here prepared to call you the AH based on the title but kinda sounds like she may be the AH. Her degree isn\u2019t science based so does she have any scientific background?\nMaybe just pay for her to take the MCAT so she understands this isn\u2019t the field for her. Side note: I have no idea how much the MCAT is, I know I only paid around 125 for GRE and as a software developer(no kids tho) this seems a small price to pay to nip this nonsense in the bud.", "INFO: Has she successfully taken and done well in all the pre-requisite courses for med school? (Eg organic chemistry, calculus, etc)", "NTA. If your wife had a communications degree 11 years ago, she might have to take some undergrad courses to meet the pre-req's before she can even start applying. If she starts on undergrad courses right now, she'll be in her late 40's before she becomes a doctor depending on what specialty she decides on. And will likely have to relocate for med school and residency. That being said, it won't cost that much time or money if she wants to take some undergrad physiology and anatomy undergrad courses, and go volunteer in a hospital (because TV shows are generally not realistic representations of reality).", "NTA. My wife won't let me go to the moon. Go figure. Seriously though, your wife should take the MCAT first then figure out how realistic those schools are and narrow it down a bit. Submitting 50 applications when you don't even know how competitive you'll be is insane. There's a lot of middle ground here and ways to be supportive without tilting at windmills.", "NTA. You\u2019re not telling her no, but your asking her to realistic. She might not even be eligible for med school with a communications bachelors and no MCAT. Maybe instead of nursing, ask her to take some college classes just to get a better sense of the field", "Sounds like OP\u2019s wife can afford 2-4 applications under the general financial rules they\u2019ve agreed on. If she can find that many schools that will consider her to have met pre-reqs in terms of her decade old class work, lack of MCAT, and (presumable) lack of patient care hours. Most schools require all of those, not sure if any require none of them. NTA for refusing to agree to any more than that number, given the lack of prep she is willing to put in. 50 would be wild even if she HAD put in a couple year\u2019s prep.\n\nThe tone of this comes across AHish, but that could be explained by reasonable frustration. Freedom to have dreams doesn\u2019t mean freedom to ruin the family\u2019s finances and spend tens of thousands of dollars on wishful thinking.", "NTA. As much as I believe everyone should be able to follow their career she\u2019s not being realistic. On top of money for school, you\u2019ll have to find someone full time to take care for he children. That\u2019s going to cut into your finances. And she\u2019s not going to be able to replenish that money quickly with her career. In addition\u2026she thinks TV shows depict what a medical career is like??? She needs to grow up. Looks so glamorous in tv. Nice ward rounds to show off what you studied. Sleepless nights look nice when you have a makeup artist on set fixing you up to continue to look good. They show you studying for 5 mins on screen and that\u2019s enough to pass exams. Yeah she needs to get some real world exposure.", "NTA. Your wife is in for a rude awakening if she is basing her decision on her watching medical TV shows. Your suggestion of taking the MCAT and/or getting her feet wet in a smaller position in the medical field first is reasonable. No med school is going to accept somebody with no MCAT and an 11 year old communications degree lol", "NTA, I\u2019m a pre-med student and there is so much work that goes into applying to medical school. Not just the MCAT, but also the required science coursework, the clinical experience, shadowing doctors, volunteering, research, recommendations, etc. Applying with little to none of these would be an insane waste of money. If she\u2019s really interested in a medical career she can start accumulating these experiences and apply later. People spend their entire undergrad years + gap years to become competitive applicants to medical/dental/PA/etc. school, and even then there\u2019s no guarantee of admission. Tell her to read the neurotic premed subreddit lol.", "NTA, she\u2019s needs more realistic expectations. Nursing school if affordable, not sure what part of the world your from though.", "NTA\n\nNot sure how you separate your finances but if you guys set aside individual fun money maybe she can spend that on her \u201cDream\u201d. Straight out applying for 50 different medical schools is nuts though.", "NTA. Just an FYI, she literally can\u2019t apply to medical school without meeting certain course requirements first (organic chemistry, bio, etc). There is also no credible medical school that will accept you without an MCAT, that\u2019s part of the process. \n\nIt sounds like she hasn\u2019t actually put much work into researching this. I would tell her that if this is ultimately her dream then you want to support it, but you need her to actually look into what is required to get into med school and how long it will take after to actually make money and become a doctor. She\u2019s going to have to take some basic weeder prerequisites first anyway. Maybe she will excel at them or maybe it will give her the reality check she needs. Grad school is tough, med school is the literal worst.", "NTA, but I have trouble believing she could do well enough in the pre-med course work and MCATs to get into Medical school.   Even getting into nursing school is tough these days", "The application fees are likely literally there to discourage spurious candidates like your wife. You can feel 100% secure in the fact that she will not be getting into any medical school with an academic record as you describe, and make your financial decisions accordingly.", "NTA.  This is a highly expensive sudden want of hers and the reality is far far different than TV shows.  She\u2019s not even used to a full time job, much less a physician\u2019s job in a hospital, residency etc, school studies and advanced degrees.", "NTA, her idea is completely ridiculous and not thought out at all. You're supportive of her entering the medical field in a sane way. She's not going to get into med school after being out of academia for 11yrs, especially without a degree in a related field.  If she was serious about this, she needs to research, study, talk to admissions counselors, and figure out what she needs to do.  How is she planning on paying tuition?  Who is going to handle childcare? \n\nI've changed careers a few times and I know what it takes. You don't need to take this seriously because she's not taking it seriously. \n\n50 applications? Insane. She has no idea what she's doing.", "NTA \n\n>my wife is refusing to take the MCAT despite my encouragement to do so first, because she thinks studying for it will slow down her timeline.\n\n >After getting into a few medical TV shows, my wife has had an obsession with being a doctor and has been trying to convince me to pay for her applications to multiple medical schools\n\nWhile worded poorly, your wife is being extremely unrealistic and unreasonable. Wanting to go to medical school because of ER and Grey's Anatomy is like wanting to become a cop because of Knight Rider. Medical school is expensive, difficult, and time-consuming, and your wife wants to do it because of television. She does not want to work her way up, she wants to start on third base.", "NTA but maybe she can volunteer at the hospital to see what the work is like. If not get an administrative job and see if she liked the environment. Medical school is a big commitment I think there should be a little more research like informational interviews before jumping in to that commitment. There is also adult scholarships. Sometimes hospitals pay for schooling if you work there.", "NTA. Perspective - the medical school associated with the hospital I work at accepts ~250 students each year.  They have 5-10k applicants and weed it down to 1500 to interview. From those 1500, they select the 250 they accept.  Competition to get in is ridiculously high.   This isn\u2019t just a daytime student hours either.  If by some miracle she was accepted, she would be in school for classes for 3 years and have to do rotations through the hospital.  Then a minimum of 3 years of residency.  If she wants to specialize, that\u2019s another 3-4 years AND includes being at the hospital overnight sometimes more than one night a week.  I wanted to be a doctor- before I had kids.  My husband told me I had to choose - kids or med school. I chose kids.  I don\u2019t regret it. I went to nursing school and love what I do. You have made reasonable suggestions for alternatives.", "Here's the thing, with a communications degree it's highly unlikely that she has the pre-requisites or academic coursework needed for medical school. It's doubtful she'll get in, but she does have the right to want to try.  If I was you, I'd consider the following:\n\n1) She studies and takes at the MCAT. You can afford that expense.  What I suspect is her score won't be that great, but maybe she'll surprise everyone. \n\n2) Also, have her fill out her FAFSA to see her financial aide options. Again, I doubt based on what you have said she'll qualify for any financial assistance.\n\n3) In the meantime, I'd use a site like Parchment and put in my GPA, school's I'd like to apply to, etc. This app tells you what your chances are of being admitted based on your data. When my girls applied to colleges it was spot on.  For example, UCLA was a 4% chance and my youngest didn't get accepted; however, other schools had higher matches and she got accepted to several of them.\n\n4) If her MCAT, GPA, etc. look good and if it appears she has the requirements to apply, I'd set a fair number of applications. For us, it was 10 schools for each of our girls; 50 is an insane amount of applications - to me it shows a lack of focus or realistic understanding of her options (but this is me). She could pick a lower tier school that's affordable, some state schools, and a couple dream schools and apply. Then, you wait and see. If she gets accepted, it's time to get real on finances. \n\n5) If she gets in, she can start applying for scholarships and financial aide. If after all this, you can afford it, then I'd say encourage her to attend and figure out a way. Commit to the first year and see how it goes.\n\nLastly, I think you have to find a way to support her and let her find out on her own way in her own time what her chances are of getting in to med school. For me, when I heard communications degree I saw an uphill climb. If her degree had been in the sciences, then I'd feel more optimistic. BUT, it's on her to figure it out.\n\nNAH - her for wanting to follow a dream; you for being concerned about finances, but \"letting\" her do something is a tell and it shows that you see yourself as being superior. You want to check that too.", "She'll be 40 ish before she can start paying off medical school loans. Such a big decision that both people need to be on board with it. NTA", "NTA. Your wife has the right to want to study and pursue her dream. However, you are right to suggest she should dip a toe into the medical field first as diving right in can ruin your financial stability.", "Your title \u201cnot letting my wife\u2026\u201d is poorly phrased and sounds very controlling. However, my fianc\u00e9 went to medical school (in the US), so I know how expensive that process is and agree it would wreck most people\u2019s finances. Furthermore, if she\u2019s sending out applications now then that is a complete waste because they will automatically be denied due to not fitting the criteria. If she has been out for 11 years and had a communication degree, she is probably lacking many prerequisites and the MCAT. Then she could send out applications. \n\nPerhaps a better solution would be having her shadow some physicians and start working on the prereqs. \n\nNTA for not wanting to spend a ton of money without fully thinking it through.", "Is she ok in general? Seems like more conversation is needed. Is this out of character? Could she be experiencing mania?", "NTA. To put it simply, your wife is delusional. Medical school is notoriously hard to get into. Nearly all medical schools require an MCAT score. Not to mention, a communications major would not have taken even half the science courses required. Plus, she's been out of school for over a decade? Most schools probably won't even look at course requirements outside of 5 years. She has literally nothing on her academic resume for schools to even look at her application. She'll get filtered out before an actual person even lays eyes on her application because there's so many requirements she won't even meet. Any considerations of applying is just a waste of money. If she wants to go to medical school, she literally needs to start from scratch.", "NTA \nShe should begin by looking at what prerequisites she has to have in her undergraduate work before she could apply to medical school. At bare minimum. She needs organic chemistry, biochem, biology, anatomy, physiology, and I have no idea how many more exist now.\n\n In other words, she's going to need 2 years of undergrad work at a minimum before she'll be ready to make the applications to medical school", "NTA. But. Let her apply.   She won\u2019t pass the MCATS and you\u2019ll be done with it.", "NTA, but let this play out.  If she is that far out with a non-STEM degree, she needs to probably do some pre-reqs and start work on the MCAT.   Let her pursue that to see how dedicated she is.  If she nails it, all the better and let her pursue it.   If she doesn't, let her see for herself when to quit and you aren't the bad guy.", "NAH\n\nWith a bachelor's degree in communications, your wife probably doesn't have the prerequisite undergrad courses to apply med school.  You're correct that it would be wasteful for your wife to just blindly apply.\n\nHowever, there's no real harm in telling her, \"I know you've been wanting to apply to med school.  You should look into the minimum requirements to apply to see what you would need to do.  For instance, you might need some Biology and Chemistry classes, and to take the MCAT.  If you need to take more undergrad classes, you could look into taking those at the local community college.\"\n\nOne of two things is probably going to happy en after you have that conversation:. Your wife will do the work required and kick butt and figure out how to become a doctor or, more likely, she will lose interest once she figures out how much work us required to become a doctor.  Your wife might even take a class or two before stopping, but also might not make it past the pipe dream phase. \n\nBut you lose nothing by supporting your wife in doing the work to figure out what's actually required.  And you wouldn't be the one to dash her dreams.\n\n(My husband and I have had this kind of conversation more than once in our 20+ year marriage.  There's been the \"way to make tons of money on stocks that no one else has figured out\" to which I said, \"You could have $X from our savings to prove out your idea, but no more than that if it loses money.\". And there's been multiple business ideas to which I've said, \"Great!  Let me know when you have a business plan for me to review.  We can talk about it more  after I've read the business plan.\". But I've always been supportive.  If things don't work out, it's because the business plan never gets written, not because I wasn't supportive.)\n\nSo, encourage your wife to develop her plan.  And if she says that some schools don't require the MCAT, ask what schools those are and what undergrad prerequisite classes she needs to take.", "NTA. She clearly doesn\u2019t understand how these kinds of things work. My guess is that she\u2019ll become obsessed with something like making illusion cakes or whatever in another month", "NTA.  Med school has pre-reqs.  She needs to do those first.", "Usually I'd be all about \"letting\" your wife do what she wants (and I only use that word because you did), because it's not on you to \"let\" her do anything. She's an adult, she can do what she wants. You're equals in a marriage, she doesn't need your permission.\n\nThat said, this one is a little different. Your wife has been out of school for a decade, and her undergrad degree was in communications of all things, not medicine or biology or chemistry or anything like that. Does she really think she's going to get into medical school? Sounds like she doesn't know shit about that area of science. And she wants to go to medical school because she watched some doctor shows on TV? Like... um.... no. Just, no. if she was a teenager who was still in school and about to go to college or starting out college and is in the middle of her educational path, that would be much different. But this doesn't seem like that sort of case. As a result, this sounds like a colossal waste of money and it's going to put a lot of stress on everyone. \n\nI'm not as concerned about the time away from home thing, because you're rich. Hire a nanny. She isn't handcuffed to the house any more than you are.\n\nI'm voting NTA on this one, but as I said, this seems like a different case than the usual misogynistic \"I'm not letting my wife do things because I'm the man and I'm in charge\" bullshit we usually get.", "NTA. Read the title and came here with guns blazing but, no. Your wife is not aware of all of the steps it would take for her to even *qualify* to submit an application to medical school. Your wife probably doesn\u2019t even have all the prerequisites necessary to apply for nursing school with her background, much less medical school. It would take a ton of work and time to accomplish that. It\u2019s nice that she feels excited about something but both you AND your wife already made certain lifestyle choices, namely having a family, that don\u2019t allow space for her to both train for, and later have, an extremely intensive career without massive changes to your family. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable for you to not be okay with those changes. Listen, I wanted to be Meredith Grey just as much as the next binge-watcher, but we gotta keep things in perspective!", "NTA. The jump from SAHM to medical school is HUGE. Support her dreams but they need to be realistic. It isn't realistic to expect you to support her going to school for years on end, residency, etc. The agreement right now was that she's the SAHM and it needs to be a reasonable agreement to change. This isn't reasonable; she's asking you for a full ride to college.", "NTA. If she hasn\u2019t taken the MCAT and has a non STEM degree and it\u2019s been that long since she\u2019s been in school, she\u2019s being completely unrealistic. She needs to try the MCAT or apply to maybe 1 school and get rejected first. Medical school is 4 years (in the US) plus 2-5 years residency plus maybe a 1-3 year fellowship as well. Plus the 2-8 years residency/fellow pays peanuts so on top of the time commitment you\u2019d be getting in the hole financially. Also, majority of US doctors who started med school with 0 student debt have loans in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Tuition is no joke.\n\nETA: residents often work 80+ hours a week and often make less than minimum wage when all is said and done. Medical school is the easy part, is she aware of this?", "Hi there. First of all to get into any medical school you need a competitive MCAT score depending on DO or MD ( at least 498, if you have a 3.8+ GPA ). Also all medical schools require pre reqs such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, physics and so on. I doubt she has taken any since her major was communications. If she wants to go back to school, take the pre reqs and then take MCAT and be ready in three years then it is plausible. Time is not on her side nor is the gravity of the competitiveness of getting accepted. My buddy is in medical school right now at age 39. I wish you both best of luck.", "NTA. That's a Huge thing to jump into. Starting by ensuring you actually like the work and the field as a CNA, or can handle the amount of study required by taking the MCAT is way more reasonable.", "NTA but the way you word a lot of this is concerning. Not \u201csupporting\u201d my wife would sound better. \u201cLetting\u201d sounds very controlling from the out set.", "INFO: How old are your children?  How expensive are the next steps with applications and the MCAT and prereq coursework?", "NTA, you gave her an alternative. She didn't like it. She is hoping to do something realistically impossible. She came at you with her head in the clouds, and you planted her ass firmly back on the ground, it is called tough love.", "INFO:\n\nIs applying to medical school even the first step in the process? Could she say study for the MCAT first?", "NTA. \n\nBut if you want, you can try researching the courses and lesson teached in med schools and buy her a books or two. \n\nIf she likes it, is passionnate about it and is able to get to learned what is asked, maybe give her a chance.", "NTA. I have a marketing degree and decided to go back to school for a medical career. She is nowhere near where she needs to be for a doctor (or even a CNA at this point). I took all the pre med classes at community college (they are difficult classes) before taking any entrance exams. You need a very solid foundation before pursuing a medical career. Instead of literally throwing away money on med school applications that will 100% be rejected. Suggest she take the pre med classes (chemistry, microbiology, anatomy/physiology, organic chemistry) she will actually need before applying. If she does well in those classes, THEN, she can take a MCAT prep course. Your wife's current plan is ridiculous and a complete waste of money. She would not only be wasting money, but also the admissions officer's time. Has she even bothered to look up the prerequisites she needs for med school?", "It sounds like your wife is having a bit of a mid-life crisis. You both should probably consider therapy to deal with underlying issues. It\u2019s an unrealistic goal if she\u2019s not prepared to do the pre-requisite work. If she\u2019s unwilling to budge from her idea, you could go along with her plan to apply, but I think you would need to be prepared to support her for the inevitable let down after receiving the rejection letters.", "NTA but your phrasing sucks. \"not letting\" gives controlling vibes. \", Not supporting unrealistic goals\" would've been a better way to phrase", "After reading your comments, NAH. It sounds like maybe she's just genuinely uncertain of what medical school entrance entails. Maybe find an admissions counselor to help your wife get a better picture of what a competitive application would entail. Might help if you're not the one telling her that she realistically can't get in. \n\nThe idea about her doing a different medical position is also a great idea, but I do get why she might have taken that as you saying she's not good enough to be a \"real\" doctor. Again, hooking her up with some good resources and support people who understand the medical school system might help there too.", "INFO:\n\nAre you not \"letting\" her or are you just not subsidizing her? These are two very different things.", "NTA depending on how you approached it. If you actually said what you posted you are an AH. Rather than telling her what you think, approach it in an open, positive way but ask some questions. I expect she is tired of being a SAHM and would like to pursue something fulfilling outside of that. Maybe she could start by doing some volunteer work at a local hospital or take some intro classes at the local college. Compromise on having her apply to a few schools, so she can understand the requirements.

You need prereqs, volunteer experience, MCAT, not to mention that medical tv shows are a horrendous misrepresentation of medicine. \n\nI hope she also has some idea of how grueling medical training is. No matter what your field, it\u2019s basically a seven year minimum commitment. I have several loved ones who are in various medical fields at various levels. Let me say this clearly - I would never be able to do what they do. \n\nThe training programs alone leech away your soul - you do not sleep. You eat poorly, whenever you can. You sometimes work 12+ hr days for 14 days in a row and then get two days off, and then do it again the next week. You have extremely limited time to do anything outside of your job during training. You absolutely have to LOVE medicine to get through it. You have to love trying to help people as they naysay you, cry, yell, have mental breakdowns, occasionally try to physically attack you. You face the realities of people from walks of life you may have never encountered and see how unfair life can be. You have to emotionally get through the number of people you cannot save no matter what you and your team do. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how they do it. \n\nYour wife needs a reality check.", "NTA. OP, another thing to note is that a lot of med schools require applicants have an understanding of what being a doctor entails. Normally this is done through shadowing other doctors, but I had friends who did it working as EMTs, nursing assistants, etc. Some schools require a significant amount of hours spent in the field. You\u2019re already on the right path encouraging her to try a related but more accessible health career, and in fact that will probably end up being essential to her applications if it goes that far.", "NTA\n\nMaybe she will find some new tv shows soon.", "NTA. There is clearly a big gap in her education that spans 11 years including her initial BS degree not even being in a STEM field.

When I was considering applying to DO schools, the Med school advisor told me I\u2019d have to retake some pre reqs because I graduated from undergrad 5 years ago and that was considered too \u201coutdated\u201d for them! \nMed schools will want those pre reqs finished before she applies. Those classes can take a few years before she can even apply to Med school!", "When she told you she passed her prerequisites, are you sure she knows what the actual prerequisites are? It would be bizarre in the extreme for a communications major (or any non-bio or chem major) to take all the med school prerequisites unless she had been planning on med school at the time. You don\u2019t take two semesters of organic chemistry as a fun elective.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being completely honest with you about pre reqs. Plus, if she just passed, there\u2019s no way she\u2019d pass the MCAT, or get a high enough score to be considered a viable med school candidate.\n\nPlus, she needs to know that those expire after a certain amount of time.", "Even in the Caribbean you need biology and chemistry.", "It's not that she \"probably wouldn't get in.\" There is no way in hell that she will get in. You're 100% safe here. Let her fail. No need for you to be the one who tells her what she can't do. Let her try. It will keep her from fighting you on it.", "Nursing isn't a step into becoming an MD, it's an entirely separate pathway for a very different job.", "Phlebotomy is also a good and quick way into the medical field.", "That is not a good solution. Why would you want to add 4 more years of nursing school if she ends up going to med school. Nursing school isn\u2019t a step on the way in med school, it\u2019s a completely different program.", "Firstly, YTA for immediately shutting her down and for the way you\u2019re condescendingly approaching her request.  But you\u2019re N T A for considering the financial implications of it.  \n\nThere is a lot that doesn\u2019t make sense here, though:  \n\n1) If she wants to go to med school, jumping in with applications is just a waste of time and money.  If she\u2019s planning on going to school in the US, she needs the MCAT.  And she needs a good score.  Suggest an MCAT prep course.  You don\u2019t just walk into a full-day (expensive) standardized exam with zero prep.  It will also be a litmus test for how she might handle the rigors required of med school.  If she can\u2019t handle a simple test prep class, she\u2019ll never handle med school. \n\nTangentially, I don\u2019t think a communications major would have the advanced science classes required.  Unless it was a science communication program.  Maybe? \n\n2) Med school applications are not $20 a pop.  They\u2019re more like $100-300 a pop.  And they\u2019re a LOT of work.  You don\u2019t just throw them out into the wind hoping one will stick.  You select a few specific programs that your strengths and experience will give you an advantage for acceptance, and that focus on your interests.  I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s looking at that suggests 50 applications are needed, or that 50 applications will be a reasonable amount of work to complete. \n\nAside from the above nonsense, the suggestion that she find an intermediate stepping stone is reasonable, but you should look into the difference of actual job duties between CNA and one of the many varieties of nursing credentials.  A bachelor\u2019s would put her well beyond the prerequisites for a CNA, which is also a job very limited in actual medical involvement.  It\u2019s mostly assist with bathing, dressing, feeding, cleaning, type duties.  But a couple years of working as a CNA would be much better to have on a med school applications than her current \u2026.checks notes\u2026\u2026nothing.  \n\nBeyond the financial considerations, you\u2019ve not mentioned the logics of pursuing a career as a physician.  \n\nShe\u2019s looking at a year (at least) of prep work and applications.  Then, even if she gets into a *local* school, it\u2019s going to be absolutely constant work.  Especially if she\u2019s never done core science classes.  That\u2019s a totally different type of studying from her communications degree.  She\u2019s looking a full work day\u2019s worth of classes, then many hours of study at home in the evening and on weekends to keep up.  Just for the first 4 years.  Your oldest will be 10, at least.  After she graduates, it\u2019s on to 2-4 years of residency working 60-80 hours a week, with consecutive days of not even coming home.  (Again, depending the specialty.)  Your kids will be teenagers by the time she even starts a career.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s IF she gets into a local school.  She\u2019ll very likely, need to move for 4 years of school, then probably move again for residency, depending on what field she wants to pursue.  There is absolutely no guarantee she\u2019ll get accepted to local programs at either point, so you need to discuss if your career would allow you to follow her\u2026.wherever. \n\nI get that you view this as a whim, and maybe it is.  But you can support her exploring the possibilities without being an AH about it.  If it is some romantic notion on her part, it\u2019ll pass.  If she\u2019s the type to dig her heels in just because someone told her \u2018no,\u2019 it won\u2019t. (And that personality trait would serve her well as a doctor.) But your support in her dipping her toes in and you NOT having a \u201ctold you so\u201d attitude if she changes her mind will be essential if you want to keep this marriage.", "Maybe she has ADHD, I do the same things where I become extremely obssessed with something and normally never follow through or finish said obsession. I will also develop hobbies and spend an astronomical amount of money and again never really finish them or fully commit to them. I just got my nursing degree and I agree she should start as a CNA then PCA then RN then doctor or nursing practitioner. I did this and it allowed me to see it was more then just a whim. I also recommend she goes to therapy, because that can heavily influence her life if it hasn\u2019t already and set her up to be disappointed with people if they don\u2019t say yes.", "I don't recommend starting with nursing -- very different role and career track (and can also be competitive).

While still competitive, makes a little more sense than nursing with her goals\nShe DEFINITELY will not get into med schools in US without recent MCAT and probably updating prerequisites \n\n(I'm a doctor)", "I think the nurse route is going down the rabbit hole.  It makes her feel like you aren't supporting her.\n\nThe one I would definitelly focus on is the MCAT requirement.  She can even talk to counselors and what not and get the confirmation she needs to take that test.\n\nIf she is type this would work on, maybe have her take the test without prep.  Let her see what her year one fellow students will know on the first day of class as compared to her.", "Hey, this isn't how the medical field works. Nursing is an entirely separate profession from doctoring. One doesn't lead into the other. Nurses can get a Masters or Doctorate in Nursing, and become a Nurse Practitioner, but you don't go from CNA to Nurse to Doctor. A BSc in Nursing won't help her progress to being a doctor.\n\nNurses get into the nitty gritty hands on, and a lot of what you see on TV is what nurses actually do. There's a lot of diversity in the profession, so you can transition towards a lighter duty career if you need to (such as towards retirement). This might appeal to your wife, if she's getting her idea of the medical field from TV. \n\nBut don't assume you can go from nurse to doctor. It's simply not how it works. You'd have some of the same prerequisites to get admitted to the program, but you'd more or less have to start over from scratch if you wanted to change professions.\n\nI'm sorry to say that most nursing schools won't accept university classes that are over ten years old. I doubt medical schools will either. \n\nTL;DR: nursing and being a doctor are completely different", "Then she needs to be realistic and grow up   No one applies to that many.", "I still don\u2019t understand why her goal is to apply to 50 schools, is that the minimum requirement to join medical school", "Lmao then she needs to grow up", "I certainly don't think there are 50 that would let her apply without it.", "Shoot, just buy her an MCAT test prep book so she can see how unrealistic this entire plan is.", "Then she needs a reality check.", "We wouldn\u2019t even see it because she\u2019s missing the MCAT so her application would never even be complete.", "Yeah, I'm very confused by the idea of starting with nursing school, as if Doctor was a promotion from Nurse.

Becoming a CNA gives you clinical experience that might help you get into medical school, but it will not help you decide if you\u2019d like being a doctor.

Medical School is very expensive, then you add in residency, and fellowship and it becomes an even longer costlier process. Then there\u2019s the reality of healthcare in America, it\u2019s good to know if you want to take all of that on.

Only 1 or 2 don't \"require\" the MCAT, but good luck getting in without one. Caribbean schools don't, but there are several extremely good reasons to not go to those which you can find online. It would also be very strange to me if she took multiple semesters of chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and physics (the prerequisites) as a communications degree but I don't know her story.

For example, she didn't let me buy new fencing for our house because it was too expensive, and I had to respect her decision. We only make large financial decisions (over $1000) together, so we \"let\" each other make those purchases. In this case, it would be purchasing 50 applications for medical school which exceeds that threshold.", "This is true. Sorry I was so negative?", "I think their point is that he works outside the home and she works inside the home and raises their children. They're a team but he does not see their money as their money but as his money.", "Totally agree. I would actually be worried about her mental health - this plan is a little nuts!", "Wait... what?", "Medical School is like 200k. If she\u2019s using their money she got to ask him first. It\u2019s the same the other way around.", "Yes, I know she would have to do medical school anyways. But at least having some sort of medical career first would increase her chances of acceptance to medical school by showing more demonstrated interest and commitment to medicine. Also, I think it would be an opportunity for her to dip her toes into the field of medicine before making huge commitments.", "I know she will have to apply to medical school regardless, but being a nurse first would give her more medical background and exposure, as well as show more demonstrated interest in healthcare to medical schools.", "That's the job my aunt started out doing, she's now a cardiac surgeon, so I disagree. It's not everyone's path, but it is a path", "It might be sarcoidosis!", "It\u2019s my understand that there are only around ten medical schools in the US that don\u2019t require the MCAT.  If she\u2019s looking at Caribbean medical schools, they have a bad reputation because they accept students who are unprepared for the rigors of medical school. As a result, they tend to have high attrition rates, poor medical licensing exam pass rates, and poor residency match rates.", "Probably not the issue at play here, but lots of qualified people have slim chances and need to apply to multiples schools.  There just aren\u2019t enough spots for everyone qualified.", "Also is the whole family supposed to up and move to one of those 50 medical schools? They can't live within commuting distance of 50 medical schools.", "AMCAS\n\nAmerican Medical College Application Service", "I'm guessing from an internship or something as pre-med in undergrad school.", "I searched job postings at my hospital and found one with on the job training. There\u2019s CNAs/nurse techs, phlebotomists, volunteers working with patients", "Seriously. Something doesn\u2019t add up. Someone\u2019s an idiot and I can\u2019t figure out which one. Or it\u2019s fake", "Yeah.\nI am a vet, my sister is a nurse practitioner and both us it was a delay of at least 4 years from undergrad. And my sis was a polysci major. NO prerecs from colleges You don\u2019t just decide to apply to med school. After 11 years.", "I don\u2019t understand this\u2014are there less than 50 schools that don\u2019t require the MCAT.\n\nIs she planning on uprooting the family when she goes to med school, assuming you don\u2019t have 50 med schools in your immediate area?  Is she planning on going off on her own?", "Ah ok.", "And a sense of what it is like to be back in school at this stage of her life.", "She won\u2019t even take the MCAT though, so she\u2019s not serious about this in any way.", "I also went to undergrad and a top business school, our graduate schooling wasn\u2019t nearly as long. Not only do they have to go to Med School, they have to do residency, where they get paid peanuts and work just as if not longer hours than the jobs you can get straight out of school from a top MBA program. \n\nMy friends who went to med school have debt issues that make mine look like an electric bill. They won\u2019t start making \u201cdoctor money\u201d until their early 40s if they don\u2019t start med school until their mid 30s. And unlike business, there aren\u2019t just jobs everywhere, it requires a lot of moving around and applying, etc.", "Let her try? If it didn\u2019t affect at all then by all means. Her decision is selfish and affects the family. Her husband wouldn\u2019t meet his financial goals even though he\u2019s presumably been working his entire life because his wife had a tv-inspired aspiration in the middle of her life. If she wants it so badly, she can pay and do the work for it. Given how she isn\u2019t even willing to take the MCAT, I\u2019d be surprised she\u2019s willing to do this though", "PA is not a stepping stone to becoming a doctor, it's its own career. it's a similar career to being a physician that is much more achievable for her at this point. But people should not become PAs with the end goal of becoming a doctor. Nor should they become nurses with this goal.\n\nThe type of job you are thinking of would be for her to work as a scribe (TONS of premeds work as scribes) or medical assistant, those are entry level jobs that don't require new degrees (like nursing would) that will get her exposure to the medical field.", "That's fine if she doesn't want a different career, but she'll need clinical experience, volunteer experience (same experience can count for both), MCAT, and probably updated prerequisite coursework too. Applying now has 0% chance of admission so will ALSO slow her down compared to doing her research and figuring out what will lead to better odds of admission her first try", "PA is definitely more aligned than nursing. I'd drop the nursing idea completely. Before all that though, she's going to need to do some serious research on prereqs for either PA or MD. And I think she's going to be shocked by what she discovers. Invest in some Kleenex before she gets to googling.", "100% agree. And now from OP\u2019s comments, I see that she\u2019s planning to use their kids as an excuse for why she can\u2019t do the MCAT\u2026 I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll go over well with admissions officers.", "I have a communications degree. I was required to take a grand total of two science courses, one lab and one non-lab. My \u201clab\u201d course was a 100-level meteorology class with a workbook.", "It\u2019s common as pre-med is a common starting point for people. I had all the requirements for med school and it made me realize I didn\u2019t want to be a doctor. But I spent two years (almost 3) taking classes. Ended up a therapist instead", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too unusual; people change majors. Both my sibling and I switched from STEM majors to liberal arts- not because we were bad at it or unable to do the work, but because we had internships that showed us that the work aligned to those degrees wasn\u2019t particularly enjoyable.\n\nI still think she\u2019s probably incorrect about the MCAT and should take that prior to applying, so OP is NTA on the applications part. But a CNA is so far from an MD I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d even suggest that, and the whole childcare thing really bothers me.", "She won\u2019t have ANY CHANCE if she doesn\u2019t take the MCAT! Only a very small selection don\u2019t require it but those are schools most people would never recommend, like the Caribbean schools. Is she going to a BA/MD program?? Like\u2026why is she so adamant about not taking the exam? It isn\u2019t comparable to the GRE. She sounds totally ridiculous, in my opinion. With her degree being 11 years old, some medical schools won\u2019t EVEN TAKE THOSE PRE REQS! Lots of schools require them to be in the last 5 years! Has she done any research, or does she think Grey\u2019s Anatomy gave her all the answers?", "Is your wife's mental health okay? Could it be that she's just feeling really unfulfilled in her life at the moment and is grasping at something she thinks might bring her some fulfilment? It seems that her expectations are so unrealistic and grandiose that there might be something else going on here.", "Shouldn\u2019t she just apply to the 15 crappiest, since they\u2019re the ones most likely to admit her? I mean, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s very nice, but I\u2019m pretty sure Harvard is a no go.", "Are there 50 medical schools that don\u2019t require the MCAT? I thought it was like 10.", "She doesn\u2019t have any chances sans MCAT. She sounds like she hasn\u2019t even read up on this. Please have her pull up the requirements for 10 schools so she can get the reality check she needs. I would not be flushing down the equivalent of college tuition for this.", "My wife mentioned some names like Toledo and Ichan, and she said that she could explain extenuating circumstances (childcare responsibilities) for not taking the exam for schools that require it. I honestly don't even know if schools that require it will consider her application even if she tries to use the excuse of extenuating circumstances.", "Yea, I figured. I mean, I knew lots of premeds back in undergrad. Every single one was obsessed with making sure they dotted every i and crossed every t because medical school applications were so competitive.  For every single medical school.", "Let her apply to every school that doesn\u2019t require the MCAT.", "Perhaps she can start with the ones she can afford then. Or an MCAT study course?", "Regardless, these applications to med school will not happen for at the very least a year as she needs to obtain extracurriculars, prerequisite course requirements, MCAT, letters of recommendation, long before using a credit card to make a payment \n\n\nSo this won\u2019t happen for a while, which means y\u2019all have quite sometime to discuss this maturely as two grown adults who have chosen to live each others lives together", "At this point that\u2019s not completely true; they\u2019re taking overflow of completely qualified people who simply cannot find placement due to the competition. \n\nI have a cousin (now a successful surgeon) who got something like 95th percentile on the MCAT and a 3.9 GPA who couldn\u2019t find a school to accept him. So he went to the Caribbean and he\u2019s well-known for how skilled he is in his field. Things are different now.", "People sometimes opt for Caribbean medical schools because of unfortunate academic circumstances as well; going to an international medical school is not necessarily a determination that someone might be \u201cunprepared for the rigors of medical school.\u201d There are plenty of Caribbean graduates who are now successful doctors; I know a few myself. But you are correct in saying that the residency match process is definitely tougher for IMGs.", "Thanks!", "Yeah given that she\u2019s supposedly saying the MCAT isn\u2019t necessary, this is either a poorly written fake or the wife is woefully ignorant", "A very similar situation has been posted about here before, wish I could find a link to it.  But similar mid-30s wife who wants to go to med school with absolutely no background knowledge at all", "Yeah, something about this post seemed off to me.  Someone with a decade old communications degree will have to go back to school and complete a lot of prereqs in addition to taking the MCAT.  If she did and OP paid for her classes, I don\u2019t understand why he would object to paying application fees.  This comes across as fake.", "Yeah I am betting she has something similar- I have four degrees and not a single one of them would get me close to med school!!", "Another med student noted in the comments that 11 year old \u201cpassing\u201d grades even if she has the course work probably won\u2019t cut it at all. OP noted she claims to have \u201cpassed\u201d the classes and does not seem confident that she excelled.", "You need clinical experience to get into most medical schools, and being a CNA counts for that. People often realize after interacting with patients and the healthcare system that it's not what they thought it would be.", "Agreed, it sounds like she hasn't done her research or is ignoring everything she doesn't want to hear.", "She's kidding herself. Maybe book her an appointment with an admissions specialist or career counselor. Ostensibly to help her get in, but actually for a reality check?", "Out of curiosity I just looked it up for Toledo and this is what they state for admission requirements \"MCAT taken no earlier than December, three years prior to matriculation year.  Exceptions may be made for students accepted through one of our early assurance programs.\"\n\nI'm a current med student, at this point, she's not going to get in, in no reality does she get into any med school. Having kids is actually not that uncommon in med school these days, but you still need to take the MCAT. She also is going to need to prove to the schools that she can handle the coursework, and so even if she could get it waived she needs to do well for her to improve her application and prove she can handle the rigors of med school. If she couldn't study for the MCAT with kids how is she going to study for classes?\n\nShe also has at least two years of pre-med coursework to get through to even meet minimum requirements. Not to mention the soft requirements to be a competitive applicant of volunteering, shadowing, and research.\n\nYou don't need to crush her dreams herself though, let her apply, not to 50 schools, and fail, and let it shake out on its own. Hopefully she'll figure it out and get a reality check somewhere in there.\n\nLastly, if she is actually serious and starts figuring things out, **have her consider PA school.** Shorter, cheaper, less competitive admission requirements (arguably), and she'll be out and practicing within two years rather than 7+ for med school. The work of a PA is much more similar to the work of a physician than a nurse.", "LOL no. No school that requires an exam will waive it because you\u2019re too busy taking care of children.", "They won\u2019t. She again sounds like she has zero idea of how this process works. Also Ichan definitely requires the MCAT. That is connected to a major hospital system in NYC. No way", "That\u2019s not how admissions work\u2026. Her application will not be considered complete without all the requirements (MCAT) and her transcripts showing the grades she got in the science classes that are required. \n\n\n\n\nWhere is she planning to get letters of recommendation?", "She refuses to take the MCAT first, and says she needs to do a very large number of applications to boost her chances of acceptance.", "OP suggested that his wife start by taking the MCATs. She refused. \n\nIf she\u2019s not willing to take that minimum step, then she has no idea what applying to medical entails.", "They probably are aware of their reputation and worked to make it better.", "Yeah. The gre is longer required for vet school. But you have to taken the pre-Rec. I went to\nVet school in Australia, I tried transferring to the US but couldn\u2019t because if 1 prerec. And I was already IN vet school there.", "Maybe she just wants over $1000 for something else he'd disapprove of and thought he'd go for this.", "Yep and being out of work. No clinical experience. No MCAT. I\u2019m not sure she knows how hard it is to get into any grad school", "I'm an attending physician and agree, especially the rec to look into PA school", "This right here is why you're NTA", "Her chances are 0. If you don\u2019t mind my saying, it\u2019s incredibly arrogant of her to think she can get into med school on a whim when med students prepare to get into med school for most of their lives, including a 4-year bachelor\u2019s degree geared toward the endeavour. I have a PhD in an unrelated field, but I teach a lot of pre-med students. I\u2019m basically brought to tears when I hear how much work they have to do, and how much pressure they\u2019re under. The ten years of post-secondary that I had to do was nothing in comparison.  \n\nOf course, you don\u2019t have a hope of convincing her of all that. I would recommend following the great advice of many of the other comments here and gently suggesting that she take other steps toward her goal besides just applying. Even just studying for the MCAT \u2014 not necessarily taking it \u2014 will give her an idea of the technical knowledge required that she simply doesn\u2019t have.", "This makes no sense. She cannot apply without an MCAT score.", "I am so curious about this.  What 50 schools are there that don't require an MCAT score?", "This may be tedious but sit down with her. Go through the list of schools she wants to apply to and put into google [I failed to get into X school with these stats] and let her see the high stats of everyone that failed to get into that school. She needs a dose of reality.", "She probably refused because one does not take the MCAT before all the other things. In fact the MCAT should be done last. Taking the MCAT is not the \u2018minimum\u2019 step. It\u2019s the last part before submitting your application", "Because the overfill of students who were absolutely qualified needed schools, too. \n\nAt this point they\u2019re accepting mostly students \u201cprepared\u201d for the rigors of medical school.", "I have three siblings who are doctors and a parent who was on the admissions committee for a medical school for over a decade. \n\nI am more aware of the process of applying for medical school than I would like. \n\nSo, while I am aware that in a traditional path for applying to med school taking the MCAT would come towards the end of the process. \n\nHowever, she doesn\u2019t want to take it at all because she doesn\u2019t want it to \u201cslow down\u201d her timeline. She is asking for money to submit applications now. So it is unlikely she is willing to do all those other things you mentioned. Which also cost money. For example, classes to cover pre-requisites, cost tuition. Things that will need to be discussed in the immediate future. \n\nAlso, your score on your MCATs often determines which medical schools you are competitive for, so if she\u2019s ready to submit applications, then her taking the MCATs is a step she should be planning to take now.", "I also know how it works, having been through it myself. \n\n\n\nMy point is that if she takes the MCAT now, she will score terribly. Then if she decides she does in fact want to do this the \u2018right way\u2019 and take the classes and do the extracurricular experiences required, and put it in the work to apply to med school, she will have ruined her chances because the MCAT score is pretty much permanent and will tank her application. \n\n\n\n\nI suggest doing something that may open her eyes to the reality of the medical school experience, that does not leave a permanent transcript behind."]}
