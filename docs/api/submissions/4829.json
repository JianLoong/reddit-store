{"id": 4829, "submission_id": "zmw7zy", "title": "AITA for telling my mom that my plans aren't her business and not to rely on me so much?", "selftext": "I (20F) currently live with my mom (my parents are divorced and I do stay at my dads too occasionally, but primarily at my moms because I don't really get along with my step mom) and pay a very reasonable amount of rent every month to her. My mom is engaged, but her fianc\u00e9e doesn't live with us, and they have a dog together who stays with us 100% of the time.\n\nI work a full time job (9-5 M-F). While I understand that even though i'm an adult, I'm living under her roof and there are still rules I have to follow, she likes to try to dictate where I spend my weekends which as been going on for months now. \n\nShe'll ask me what my plans are for the upcoming weekend on like a Monday or a Tuesday, to which I'll always almost reply with \"I have no clue yet\".\n\nShe'll then get annoyed at me and tell me that she plans on doing x, y and z on the weekend and that she NEEDS to know what I plan on doing so that she can plan around me and her plans don't end up \"screwed\".\n\nShe'll also make these plans and expect me to either be home to watch the dog, or ask if I can go to my dads on the weekend and take her and her boyfriends dog with me, because she can't take their dog with her for whatever reason. (I love their dog like he's my own, but at the end of the day it's not my responsibility to have him with me all the time).\n\nThis past weekend I had made plans with my boyfriend and he was going to come over to my moms house. As usual my mom asked me what I had planned for the weekend and I told her. She told me that her fianc\u00e9e is coming over and to go to my dads or my grandparents because she wants to have the house for just the two of them (her fianc\u00e9e still lived at home with his mom, so his place was kind of out of the question). \n\nI told her that I'm sticking to my plans and staying home. She told me no, don't be here. It turned into a very heated argument and I held my ground. She told me to not be home or that she will tell me to get out. I told her that is if thinks she's going to dictate where and what I do with my weekends off, then to not expect me to pay her rent. I also told her that I'm not going to be taken advantage of and give her money that I'm working for just for her to treat me like this and use me as some babysitter, as I have my own life. \n\nShe called me selfish and a b\\*tch and said that it's her house so she'll do what she wants.\n\nI ended up packing a bag and staying at my dads for a few days. I am now back at my moms and we are currently not speaking to each other.\n\nMy dad agrees with me that what she did is fucked up, while my grandparents are trying to stay \"neutral\" and feel that it is her house so she can do as she pleases. Her fianc\u00e9e doesn't know that any of this happened.\n\nSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1671138680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmw7zy/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_plans_arent_her/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mum can't have it both ways.", "NTA, may be her house but as I saw on Judge Judy, If she wants to treat you like a child she can't take your rent. If she takes your rent your a tenant and she can't dictate your life.", "NTA if things happened like you said, but you need to find a new living arrangement. This is clearly not working out for either of you.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t know why you came back.  This is clearly not working, and you should just find a place that won\u2019t tack free dogsitting on to your obligations or try and kick you out every time having a roommate around is inconvenient.", "NTA. You pay rent, you're allowed to be there.\nBest solution is to move out (maybe your dad will agree for you to move in with him if you pay him a similar rent). She gets her house to herself, you dont have to deal with her kicking you out of your own home.", "Um, forget the judgement, You just need to live elsewhere.", "NTA - I think your mom is trying to hold on to the relationship that you two had when you were in high school.  It might not be a bad idea for you to get your own apartment, then it's a non-issue.  If you stay, the two of you need to have a very non-emotional conversation about your expectations of each other, because it won't really work as a roommate-type relationship.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to move out. Your mom is being manipulative and demanding expecting you to basically revolve around her needs.\n\nAnd if she's literally telling you to leave while you pay rent to stay there, she's being unreasonable and absurd.", "NTA, but move out.

Is she your mom or your roommate? Roommates have one expectation and \u2018moms\u2019 have another. There is nothing wrong with telling your mom that she\u2019s treating you like a freeloader and not a roommate.  \n\nMy thoughts\u2026NTA. But I\u2019d maybe look at finding an apartment and moving out of mom\u2019s house and take away the blurring of the lines there between mom and roommate. Roommates have no right to demand you vacate your home so they can naked fun times with the significant other. If you want to stay where you are then you need to sit mom down when emotions are calm and hammer out what she expects from you as a renter and decide from there if you are willing to meet those requirements. If this is an ongoing issue as it sounds you\u2019re probably best just taking away the issue by moving out and maintain the relationship with your mom.  Just my $0.02.", "NTA. Your mom is controlling and the only way you're going to be able to get out of this conundrum is by moving out.", "NTA. She is being selfish and unreasonable. Hopefully you'll be able to move out soon so she can plan knowing that you won't be there every weekend.", "NTA but you definitely need to move out.", "NTA. You pay rent and are a tenant. Look up the tenant laws where you live. It would probably also help to have a rental agreement if you don\u2019t already have one.", "NTA. You pay rent. That makes you a tenant. Short of a bug bombing type situation, your landlord is not justified in demanding that you not be present on a whim. She may not like that but she is out of luck. She has zero right to dictate anything in your life. She can't have her cake and eat it too.

Yes.  IF she had done it differently, given you a bigger heads up, asked nicely, would you have agreed?

Can\u2019t your mom just get wet and wild in her house without the dog and you watching them. You could stay with your dad and pay him rent. You could split a place with your bf.
