It is best for you to help you moving on from all of the ill will and anger you harbor towards him. This can affect your health.  Communication without anger can help both sides of this. Your father may shed some light on where he was emotionally during this period.   He may have given all that he was able to give at the time.  People are at different places and abilities at different times.  Forgiveness is more for your recovery.", "ESH. Mostly you and your mother. Stuff happens to everyone all the time when they need them the least, that\u2019s just life. By forgiving your father you could be opening up a whole new chapter of your life.", "Yep, he wasn't much of a father when it really mattered and he's still being an ahole about it now.", "Forgiveness maybe for her/his recovery but it doesn't matter where he was emotionally. He's the damn parent.  You don't get to peace out. He even admitted he wanted to keep his single lifestyle. \n\nSo, if OP becomes homeless,  disabled  or needs money, do you think that deadbeat is going to stick around? OP has already mourned the loss of her father and all she has is a sperm donor. She owes him nothing."]}
