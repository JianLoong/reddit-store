I would see her switch when talking to her friends or family. Like girl you\u2019re juggling three different languages at once???? Same thing with the other friend, knows at least 3-4 languages and thinks her English is crap of all things.

He was wrong here, but truth is, the more time that passed the weirder it would seem when it did come out she speaks Spanish. He would also assume she was being sneaky to see what he\u2019s said about her.

Like wtf?", "Spanish is my FIFTH language. So definitely not first, second, third, nor fourth....", "In OP's case she knew he spoke Spanish and didn't say anything. He also never asked and living in Germany where many residents speak multiple languages it wouldnt be weird to ask.

I speak (bad) spanish and my partner speaks fluent Spanish and we both have always seen it as an insult. I", "That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she speaks the language. He could have assumed (and he seems pretty selfish so I could see it) that she was watching to learn for him not that she already knows.", "He assumed because she has had months to tell him she can. It wasn't an assumption based on nothing. It was based on him living his life with her, and her lying by omission that she can speak the same language as he can.\n\nAdd to his friend issue, he now knows private conversations he thought he could have in Spanish with her there, he now knows she was eavesdropping on.", "I\u2019m talking about the boyfriend\u2019s reasoning mostly.

I\u2019m saying it\u2019s super weird to assume that a European doesn\u2019t speak Spanish *because* they\u2019re white, since Europe has Spain, which is where Spanish comes from, where there are a lot of white people. I\u2019m not saying Germans speak Spanish. If the boyfriend said \u201cshe\u2019s German she doesn\u2019t speak spanish\u201d that would be different.

Besides, he didn\u2019t say that she doesn\u2019t speak it because she\u2019s white, he said it\u2019s because she\u2019s a gringa. I think there\u2019s more of a cultural attachment than a racial one.", "Aah, got it. Thanks for clarifying.", "Perhaps it's just my perspective. I'm used to people sharing the languages they speak in the US and outside of the US. Not that people just start raffling off languages that they speak but that it comes up when people are close even if it's not the language that they speak with each other. So my viewpoint is skewed because I'd say \"Hey I speak German too\" doesn't mean that's the norm with everyone.", "It might not come up if you know a random slew of languages, but I do find it very weird that you wouldn't mention that you knew your bf's first language.\n\n Maybe he'd prefer to speak in that language generally? You'd think OP would casually mention that they knew Spanish, near the start of their relationship, to find out."]}
