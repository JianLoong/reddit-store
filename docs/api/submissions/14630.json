At least the friend was considerate enough to ask upfront vs call her a \"gringa\" (not exactly an endearing term).", "And to your boyfriend about his mother tongue? OP sounds like she\u2019s 15 ngl.", "By sheer numbers and influence Castellano is much more associated with LATAM than Spain; same with how despite Portuguese being an European language you have Brazilian cities with more speakers than all of Portugal and Portugal's domain on the language is effectively dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole colonizer language thing is also very easy to gloss over because of how, with all due respect, barebones and de-centralized the native languages are in the bigger countries.\n\n\n\n\nIn countries like NZ where the natives were a unified group it's somewhat easier to revive native languages, same in Ireland or Wales where there is a homogeneous group that was opressed and not a huge diverse group of peoples all lumped into the same identity.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Americas where most native languages had no written form, have a very different syntax and there are dozens of them it's hard to consolidate a project to revive them.\n\n\n\n\nAnd you're right that it's messed up how some countries *glares at argentina* like to pretend that they're European enclaves in the Americas instead of former colonies. Still, I find that aside from a more general \"latino\" identity there's no real other alternative due to how miscigenated everyone is.", "No it\u2019s not. I speak Spanish language. Most people commenting on this post don\u2019t. It means a foreigner, usually an English speaker who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish.\n\n[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola](https://dle.rae.es/gringo?m=form)", "It's like she's waiting to catch him talking bad in front of her. \n\n@ OP When u met I'm sure he would've been stoked to speak in Spanish with you. Now you're a liar to him.", "You don't even receive TVE? In Belgium you get Italian, Spanish and Portuguese public television by default (probably plenty other) in any tv (cable/telco/satellite) subscription.", "I absolutely don't think op is an asshole, but if she watched the telenovela from a German TV channel, it likely had German texts. I'm European and my knee-jerk reaction would be to assume they watched the show with texts.", "Their friend asked if she spoke Spanish or not that\u2019s not a conversation", "So much this. Im a native english speaker living in NL. Most dutch people can understand you okay, but have more than a 5 minute conversation and you'll see that the english really falls off. They think they speak better english than they really do. The phrase charcoal engels is there for a reason.  \n\n\nThe 3.2 average in the NL is not what people think it is. Those 3.2 languages are dutch, english, frisian(dutch dialect) and french/german. The french and german are considered to not be known enough to have full conversations but only enough to ask for say directions or where an item is.  \n\n\nI have 2 children going to highschool here and languages have dropped drastically. They used to give the option of having a real 3rd language however due to the teacher shortage thats been going on for years, thats no longer a thing.  \n\n\nMy daughter is in HAVO, on a path to become a doctor which requires her to know at least 1 more language by uni, and currently they only teach dutch and english. They gave her the option to learn german, french and spanish, all of which she chose, but they are self taught with book instruction only. No teacher input on if she's actually speaking it properly. Luckily for her between her dad and myself we got her covered as we speak them fluent enough to help her.", "But telenovelas are very specific. I definitely notice whether a telenovela is on or whether it's an american soap opera. When living in Germany I would definitely notice anything on the telly that wasn't in German.", "Because German channels are known for having telenovelas and subtitles /s  \nShe's from Germany, not (South-)Eastern Europe. At minimum he could've asked how come she's into telenovela. The second question would've been how come she isn't watching them dubbed", "This is like assuming everyone in Asia speaks Chinese", "Why? There are a lot of European languages. Most Germans *don't* speak Spanish.", "And the most commonly foreign languages offered are englisn, French and german\u2026 not spanish (at least in northern european countries) so its absolutely logical to assume someone who is already speaking english as a foreign language doesnt understand spanish\n\nAs she is weird as hell saying it stung he didnt specifically ask.. this is info you offer to others not pout and wait to be asked", "But he\u2019s not from Germany so A) might not know or B) she added Netflix translation subtitles. She didn\u2019t make it sound like they watched them together so all he might have heard was Spanish but doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t make assumptions. And considering he obviously made assumptions with what he said to his friend why are all of you arguing these points? I\u2019m addicted to this thread but I need to quit it man. Common sense isn\u2019t so common."]}
