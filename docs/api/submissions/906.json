You did nothing wrong, but I think we know why she's not the ex-gf.", "Info: Do you have feelings for A?", "NTA, as long as you weren\u2019t doing it ulterior motives, only you know that not us.  Kinda weird to even ask if you know you weren\u2019t doing it maliciously\u2026.", "NTA\n\nNow we know why the couple broke up. At any rate, you posted a moment. Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA controlling ex girlfriend is uncomfortable with platonic friendships. Couple breaks up and the guy seeks friendships for stability, ex kicks off as she's insecure. Guaranteed she was projecting her own feelings on to you and was either cheating, wanting to cheat, or has someone else now. Ignore her and move on. Happy posting", "The ex draws a wrong conclusion based on photos you post on Instagram. No, of course that makes you NTA. That ex is definitely TA for the drama she makes of it.", "nta. A's ex girlfriend sounds like a jealous ah, because there's nothing wrong with posting your friends on social media.", "NTA she has no claims to him lol", "Not as of now, Last year i did but backed off when i found he had a girlfriend. We're really good friends :)", "NAH - as long as you really don't have feelings for him, being friends with him is not an assholish thing, nor is posting pics of him. \n\nHOWEVER, if it was known you had a crush on him previously, I can understand why his ex is upset to suddenly see you two in your insta feed... she's hurting and lashing out, and based on your prior feelings, i can understand why she would... (and the rest of the choir's responses are likely split on which of you they are closer to, so whether they are hearing your current feelings, or your old feelings)."]}
