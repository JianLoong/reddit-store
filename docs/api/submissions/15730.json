Both of us are into video games so it was fun to do it together. Then something happened in January and I told her I would never play video games with her again. She was home from school while I was in school and my parents let her use the family computer to game. We're only allowed to game on the family computer so we don't spend too much time on it. During Covid one of my friends made us a Minecraft server that we still play on sometimes. We've done so much on that server too. While my mom was in the room my sister went into the server and destroyed stuff that my friends and I had built, got most of our materials blown up, broke stuff that took us forever to get working and then she crashed the server. I came home while she was still playing and saw that she had crashed a server. She's not super into Minecraft but she has played it and knows what she's doing in that game and when I saw what server she did that to I was pissed. I told my friends and the friend whose parents paid for the server was able to get it back up and we saw what she had done. I told my sister she had no right to do that crap. She told me it was just a server and we could make another one and she was just having fun. I told her since she found it fun I would not play video games with her anymore because she disrespected my work and my friends work.\n\nMy mom was surprised I was so angry and I had to explain to her what she did. She told my sister no computer time while she was home from school and she should apologize. My sister didn't then because she thought I'd change my mind when I wasn't angry anymore. I'm not angry with her now but I'm sticking to no video games together. I don't trust her and she doesn't deserve to play with me after what she did. She apologized to me but refused to apologize to my friends. I'm so lucky they weren't mad at me too, because I know it was my account she used to do it. I told her my answer was no. This was a few weeks after it happened and now it's been a few more weeks and this weekend we both had no plans and she wanted to play video games together and I said no. She said she was sorry and begged and started crying. I told her my answer was still no. I told her she's saying sorry because she doesn't want the consequences of what she did but she didn't apologize to everyone she did it to. My parents are divided over this because mom thinks I shouldn't give consequences forever while my dad said since I'm not treating her badly or refusing to spend any time with her, this is fair given what she did and given she would not apologize to my friends (something my parents have told her she should do and have given her consequences for not doing).\n\nMy mom told me I should reconsider and I am being harsh. That I looked at my crying sister and refused to give in which seems kind of mean. My sister believes I hate her even though I told her I don't.

By OP giving into the crying, would it reinforce that expectation and behavior?", "You know what my mom always told me growing up, \u201cyou should forgive people when they make mistakes, because you\u2019ll want people to forgive you as easily when you make mistakes.\u201d Dog does the punishment fit the crime? Lmao she\u2019s a 12 yo kid who did something stupid. Grow the fuck up. ESH. I have a younger brother that consistently did things that pissed me off but I always forgave him and if he wanted to spend time w me doing something both of us loved I would be damned if I didn\u2019t take every opportunity to do it w him and because of that we are both in our 20s and are best friends.", "NAH, but you\u2019re basically punishing a different person at this point. She\u2019s 12. It wasn\u2019t a pattern of bad behavior and she didn\u2019t know what she was doing at the time.

Don\u2019t let it become a pattern, make regular backups.", "No one is an arsehole here because, although you're both behaving like children, you are both children so it makes sense. Refusing to play with a 12 year old ever again is immature, but you're 15, so you're not an arsehole for behaving immaturely. \n\nI'm sure that game was really important to you and your friends, and you're upset that your sister didn't see that. It doesn't sound like she was giving a fake apology, she almost certainly didn't realise how important it was to you, even if she understands what Minecraft is and how it works, that doesn't mean she would have anticipated your reaction. She's 12! And I'm not surprised she doesn't want to apologise to your friends, she's probably embarrassed and slightly intimidated by them. I find 15 year old boys kind of intimidating tbh and I'm an adult!\n\nHow long are you planning to avoid playing games with her? For the rest of your life?\n\nWhen my uncle was about 8 or 9 and my mum was about 14 or 15, she had a go playing a video game that my uncle had been working on for weeks, died and lost all of his progress. He was absolutely furious. Now, they look back and laugh, because they're both adults. Last summer, we went on a big family holiday to Scotland. I brought my Switch, and we all played together. Imagine if my uncle had said \"I'm not playing with Cathy because she lost all of my progress on a game 40 years ago!\" That would be stupid. So you'll have to give up on this eventually. \n\nWhy not give her another chance, explaining to her that you're still upset about the Minecraft thing and if she does anything like that again you will be really upset and won't play with her again for another 3+ months.", "Find a different video game to play if you don't trust her on Minecraft.\n\nI recommend sims 3, but then I've been playing that game on and off since I was about 15 so I'm biased.", "Yeah, I mean, we still watch movies together and I have played outside with her and stuff. But video games are off the table for me now. It's still clear I expect her to apologize to my friends. She still refuses to.", "She hasn't said why she won't apologize. She just refuses. Has refused it when I told her to, when mom told her to and when dad told her to.", "She did know what she was doing.

As a young girl, apologising to a group of older boys has to be very daunting.", "Welcome to having a child in your house. She\u2019s learning, testing boundaries. Your server was a casualty. It sucks, and it hurts. Do you think she wanted to permanently damage the two of yours relationship? Are you going to let her?", "They lost 2 days off progress on the server 3 months ago.

I don\u2019t care about the theoretical about things that didn\u2019t happen. \n\nYou continuing to not play video games with her isn\u2019t productive or nice of you. You said this happened \u2018during COVID\u2019 and you\u2019re still punishing her about it. \n\nYou\u2019re a teenager too, but take my advice. Forgive your sister and make her happy. You don\u2019t need issues in your relationship, and this grudge isn\u2019t benefitting anyone.", "Ok, you might be right and she might be going through a phase where she wants to break stuff as kids do especially when they\u2019re going through puberty. But surely there are games you can play where it\u2019s not possible to break anything? Like Mario kart? And there are things that aren\u2019t video games where she potentially could break things? That\u2019s what doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\nAs I say, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an arsehole but surely you agree with me that you would be an arsehole if you continued to refuse to play games with her even 40 years into the future? It just seems a shame if you both had a shared hobby and you never play games together again because she made one mistake. Obviously it was a very big mistake but I think you should hold the boundary for a bit longer so she knows you\u2019re serious, and then give her another chance.", "No, this happened in January.

Your uncle is your uncle and OP is OP. They are two completely different people in two completely different scenarios. Stop projecting your case on OP. Your mother made an honest mistake once. OP's sister intentionally made multiple mistakes on many occasions. He can refuse to play video games with his sister even 60 years from now and still not the AH. He's not cutting her out of his life, he's just refusing to play video games with her because of her own actions. \n\nAlso, you said your uncle and your mother are cool now. But you never mentioned how long did it take for your uncle to forgive your mother's honest mistake? \n\n>It just seems a shame if you both had a shared hobby and you never play games together again because she made one mistake. \n\nThis is a minimalization of what she did. The sister did not make one mistake, she made several mistakes in a long period of time.\n\nTo elaborate:  \n_She destroyed her brother and his friends' hard work FOR FUN (first and biggest mistake).  \n_She brushed it off when her brother confronted her.  \n_She refused to apologize to him and only apologize when she realized he wasn't gonna play video games with her anymore.  \n_He told her to apologize to his friends & she refused.  \n_Her mother told her to apologize to his friends & she refused.  \n_Her father told her to apologize to his friends & she refused.  \n_Until now, she still refuses to apologize to his friends and try to cry and beg to avoid owning up to her mistakes. \n\n>Obviously it was a very big mistake but I think you should hold the boundary for a bit longer so she knows you\u2019re serious, and then give her another chance.\n\nShe knows OP is serious. It's just that her ego or whatever reason she has is more important than playing video games with OP for her to refuse to apologize to his friends (who she wronged).", "do you not have a backup?", "There was a backup but it didn't include everything that was on the server when she destroyed it. My friend's brother helped with the backup but we lost about two days of work with the backup.", "oh, you lost 2 days of work? It seemed from the rest of your explanation it was 2 years?\n\nShe made a mistake, but she is 12...", "12 is old enough to understand not to break people's things. We learn this in kindergarten. She fucked up, refused to apologize, and is reaping the consequences of her actions.", "We had a backup of the server but that backup was not entirely up to date. My sister did not know there was a backup though and the original server had over 2 years of work in it.", "NTA First, you are proving to be a man of your word. You told her you'd never play video games with her again and are currently sticking with it. She will learn that you are not issuing threats but are telling the truth should a similar situation arise.\n\nSecond, she was given an out. She is the one not choosing to take it. You asked her to apologize to everyone involved. If she is truly remorseful she would be begging for forgiveness. She doesn't regret what she did, only that she has to face the  consequences of her actions.\n\nThird, she destroyed any trust you had in her. She used your information to destroy it. This could have easily gone very badly if your friends had blamed you and I wonder if she was jealous of you and your friends.\n\nIf you give in now then she will learn that crying and pouting or complaining to your mom will work to get her out of trouble. This cycle will continue over and over. \n\nI'm glad that your dad has your back. You are being an amazing big brother and an outstanding human by being civil to her and not holding a grudge against her in other areas of your lives.", "NTA.  Good for you for insisting that she apologize to your friends.    \n\n\nTrust is important in relationships.  She should learn now that there are consequences.  Those consequences can be permanent. You can\u2019t do or say any nasty thing, and then insist that people just get over it.  Certain words or action can destroy a relationship completely. She\u2019s lucky you still do other things with her.", "Nope. NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re giving her a valuable, cheap life lesson.", "NTA - I would say this is a fantastic way to have handled this. There's an idea called natural consequences, so if a kid spills or breaks something, the natural consequence of that would be having to clean it up or fix/replace it (with help depending on age/ability). In this case, a time out or a loss of screen time has no link to the incident and won't teach the kid how to handle themselves with this sort of thing in the future. \n\nWhat you have done is a perfect natural consequence for what your sister did, well done!!", "NTA\n\nGreat job at making her realise that people may wanna not trust her to play with her if she breaks that trust once.", "NTA, but also a valuable lesson in taking regular backups.", "Nta. Your mom realizes if she keeps giving in when she cries, she is reinforcing that behavior & your sister will do it just to get her way?!? She isnt sorry, you dont wait weeks or months to apologize & expect anyone to believe you really mean it", "NTA: I remember reading a story about a some siblings who had a similar incident. Brother had destroyed a whole garden land his sister and created on Minecraft and the parents punished the son as if he had done this IRL. He got to keep his computer time but he was only allowed to rebuild his sisters world until it was done before he could do his own stuff.", "> My mom told me I should reconsider and I am being harsh. That I looked at my crying sister and refused to give in which seems kind of mean.\n\nWho cares if she's crying?  12 is too old to be crying to get what she wants, and your mother is backing her up?  That's ridiculous.  Just curious, does your mother favor your sister because she's younger, because she's a girl, or both?\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Never forgiving her would be excessive and a bad idea, but you have given her a reasonable out. She only needs to apologize. Your parents should talk with her about this and stop making you do all the work. Facing what she did and apologizing would be a good experience for her, but it's her parents' job and not yours to get to the bottom of why she doesn't want to do that.\n\nTry to speak in more positive terms, even though you're the wronged party. Tell her that you don't hate her, that you love her, but that she didn't only hurt you with what she did. She needs to apologize to everybody who shared the things she broke before things can be like they were.", "NTA.  You aren't punishing her forever, you are punishing her until she apologizes to your friends.  That is 100% fair.  \n\nShe is 12, and she is at an age where you can be more blunt.  Tell her to grow up, and that her crocodile tears don't mean anything until she owns up to what she did to all parties involved.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. She is plenty old enough to understand what she was doing.\n\nThat said, I don't think you should hold this over her forever. I think you insisting that she apologise to your friends whose work she destroyed is very fair, and I would add that she has to actually be sorry, as well. If/when she has genuinely apologised to all of you and accepted responsibility for her actions, it might be time to play together again.", "Nta\n\nWhy she refuses to apologize to your friends?", "NTA. You are still being respectful and you still spend time with her. But she destroyed a multi-year project between you and your friends. That is significant. \n\nWere you using realms?

Tell your mom that your sister crying is manipulative and you don't give in to that kind of behaviour.", "NTA, if it was a 0 year old even a 5 or 6 year old hitting a computer is understandable, but she destroyed the server knowing what she was doing.", "NTA. She is learning that when you betray someone\u2019s trust, whether it be someone as close as your brother or someone as random as a stranger, they likely won\u2019t want to engage with you anymore. She did something she knew was wrong and would upset someone for her own entertainment and now she can do that on her own.", "Maybe she's jealous of your friendship with your friends? Or of how good the server looked? \n\nDefinitely not defending her. I'd be as mad as you in this situation and you're doing the right thing here. Don't break your stance or she'll learn that she can get away with such behavior.\n\nI'm just trying to understand what might push her to do this, as she knew how much effort you put into it. The only thing that comes to my mind is jealousy or envy.", "NTA \n\nNo she needs to apologize to your friends. Until then no gaming together. She\u2019s 12 she should understand there are consequences to her actions. You still talk to her and spend time with her and no being mean. You aren\u2019t doing anything wrong.", "NTA - I did something similar when I was younger cause I was annoyed at brother over something completely stupid and being young and dumb I thought it would be funny way to get him back. Safe to say I didn't play games with him for a few years and I definitely learnt my lesson\nAll these people who are like but she crying , she's crying cause she facing the consequences of action, give in now and all she does learn is that if she turns on the water works she can get whatever she wants, u can't back down now.", "NTA.  She knew what the fuck she was doing.", "> 12 is young enough that she might not have fully grasped the harm she was doing in the moment...\n\n12 is also old enough not to be rewarded for crying to get her way, as OP's mother is doing.", "OP's sister is clearly already doing it just to get her way.  I'm guessing OP's mother has expected him to do whatever his little sister wants for a long time.", ">you should forgive people when they make mistakes, because you\u2019ll want people to forgive you as easily when you make mistakes.\u201d \n\nHow does that apply here? The sister didn't make a mistake, she intentionally went into the server and destroyed a lot of work. It's not like something went wrong with the computer or she accidentally shut it off or something. It kind of sounds like you're comparing this to her dropping and breaking a plate or something, when that's not the case. This is like her deliberately throwing the plate againat the floor. \n\nIf OP were to intentionally go into one of her games and delete all her progress, would you call that a mistake? Would you be pushing for the sister to play with him again?\n\n>I have a younger brother that consistently did things that pissed me off but I always forgave him and if he wanted to spend time w me doing something both of us loved I would be damned if I didn\u2019t take every opportunity to do it w him and because of that we are both in our 20s and are best friends.\n\nIt's not like OP is suddenly completely avoiding his sister. He says he still spends time with her and they do other things together, just not video games. Which is reasonable-why would he want to play with her qgen he now knows how little she actually cares about it and how easily she's willing to destroy something he enjoys? 12 is plenty old enough to learn there are consequences for your actions, and that sometimes, you're responsible for damaging a relationship. Her actions hurt OP, and now she has to deal with him not wanting to engage in one activity with her. \n\nOP alao doesn't say anything about how long he's going to not play video games with her. Maybe he feels like he just needs a break while he tries to get over her behavior. Maybe he's being cautious bc he doesn't think she really regrets it and is willing to do it again if he just forgives her. Maybe he'd be willing to play video games with her again at some later date.", "OP might be willing to do that, but his sister still hasn't apologized to all the people she harmed, even after her parents told her to do so.", "She's crying to get her way.  OP shouldn't reward that behavior, even if his mother thinks he should.", "It's weird that you (a 15 yo) is the most mature person in AITA in a while.\n\nNTA.", "Want to be clear 100% NTA and I think you're in the right \n\nI also think your sister was jealous that your friends were \"stealing\" game time with you.", "Maybe she's jealous of your friends? Maybe she sees gaming as an \"us only\" thing, so you playing with someone else might have triggered it.\n\nI had a friend who's younger sister was glued to her and hated when she played with other people she even hit me once and broke some stuff because we were going somewhere without her.\n\nYou're NTA and I think you're handling it well.", "If you could literally read 10 more words, I specifically state that it's also old enough for her to understand that this is a natural and fair consequence to her actions. \n\nNowhere did I say she should be rewarded to \"crying to get her way\"", "His sister is a 12 year old girl who did something stupid. My friends and I once had a world we built that my brother tnt bombed the fuck out of when I was 16ish and he was 10. I was pissed for like 2 hours, but when I talked to my friends about it we all just started laughing our asses off about it because it was a stupid fucking Minecraft world. Honestly perusing the subreddit for as long as I\u2019ve had has made me appreciate tf out of my family and parents because everyone here is so childish and wrong sometimes. Think about it. Hurting your 12 yo sister by not letting her do something for months that she loves doing w you, because she did something stupid. And every idiot here is going oh yeah completely N T A. I\u2019ll 100% stand by my verdict.", "I'm with you, OP.  I think it's appalling that she did all that, and now she's crying to get her way and your mother wants *you* to reward that behavior.", "I think this is spot on.", "You're not wrong. This is most likely why she doesn't want to apologise, because she recognises that what she did was wrong and is ashamed of it. She is close enough to bro, and it's within the \"family\" sphere so she is comfortable admitting to that mistake to him. But doing it with other, older boys? Very daunting, even if she recognises that she should. \n\nNote that this is not saying she shouldn't apologise, there should be some way to work this out that balances her fear and the need for her to apologise, such as a letter. But yes, I can absolutely see why a 12 year old girl wouldn't want to be emotionally vulnerable with a group of boys that she doesn't know.", "I agree that could feel very intimidating to a 12 year old girl. \n\nHowever, they should alleviate that aspect by offering her alternate ways to apologize, with parents there, by letter, individually on a phone call, etc.", "i\u2026 huh? she intentionally ruined a server OP and his friends had worked on? she\u2019s old enough to apologize, she\u2019s old enough to grasp consequences.\n\nlike fr it\u2019s not hard to apologize and admit what she did was wrong. i was a young \u201cgirl\u201d and i still apologized to older boys when i messed up", "It\u2019s a pattern of not apologizing. Every day for months she has made the choice to not apologize.\n\nThe mom is the reason this kid is the way she is. She thinks she can just wait out consequences. I\u2019m glad dad and OP have their heads on straight.", ">Have you met kids?\n\n*Have you met bad kids? \n\nYes. And it's no help enabling their bad behaviors.", "I\u2019m as baffled by these judgements as you are. Truly bizarre.", "Her intention was to destroy it all."]}
