Both of us are into video games so it was fun to do it together. Then something happened in January and I told her I would never play video games with her again. She was home from school while I was in school and my parents let her use the family computer to game. We're only allowed to game on the family computer so we don't spend too much time on it. During Covid one of my friends made us a Minecraft server that we still play on sometimes. We've done so much on that server too. While my mom was in the room my sister went into the server and destroyed stuff that my friends and I had built, got most of our materials blown up, broke stuff that took us forever to get working and then she crashed the server. I came home while she was still playing and saw that she had crashed a server. She's not super into Minecraft but she has played it and knows what she's doing in that game and when I saw what server she did that to I was pissed. I told my friends and the friend whose parents paid for the server was able to get it back up and we saw what she had done. I told my sister she had no right to do that crap. She told me it was just a server and we could make another one and she was just having fun. I told her since she found it fun I would not play video games with her anymore because she disrespected my work and my friends work.\n\nMy mom was surprised I was so angry and I had to explain to her what she did. She told my sister no computer time while she was home from school and she should apologize. My sister didn't then because she thought I'd change my mind when I wasn't angry anymore. I'm not angry with her now but I'm sticking to no video games together. I don't trust her and she doesn't deserve to play with me after what she did. She apologized to me but refused to apologize to my friends. I'm so lucky they weren't mad at me too, because I know it was my account she used to do it. I told her my answer was no. This was a few weeks after it happened and now it's been a few more weeks and this weekend we both had no plans and she wanted to play video games together and I said no. She said she was sorry and begged and started crying. I told her my answer was still no. I told her she's saying sorry because she doesn't want the consequences of what she did but she didn't apologize to everyone she did it to. My parents are divided over this because mom thinks I shouldn't give consequences forever while my dad said since I'm not treating her badly or refusing to spend any time with her, this is fair given what she did and given she would not apologize to my friends (something my parents have told her she should do and have given her consequences for not doing).\n\nMy mom told me I should reconsider and I am being harsh. That I looked at my crying sister and refused to give in which seems kind of mean. My sister believes I hate her even though I told her I don't.

Separately, is there a negative female stereotype of women crying (honestly or not) as a method to get what they want? By OP giving into the crying, would it reinforce that expectation and behavior?", "You know what my mom always told me growing up, \u201cyou should forgive people when they make mistakes, because you\u2019ll want people to forgive you as easily when you make mistakes.\u201d Dog does the punishment fit the crime? Lmao she\u2019s a 12 yo kid who did something stupid. Grow the fuck up. ESH. I have a younger brother that consistently did things that pissed me off but I always forgave him and if he wanted to spend time w me doing something both of us loved I would be damned if I didn\u2019t take every opportunity to do it w him and because of that we are both in our 20s and are best friends.", "NAH, but you\u2019re basically punishing a different person at this point. She\u2019s 12. It wasn\u2019t a pattern of bad behavior and she didn\u2019t know what she was doing at the time. Her digging her heels in sucks, but again, she\u2019s 12.\n\nForgive, but don\u2019t forget. Don\u2019t let it become a pattern, make regular backups.", "No one is an arsehole here because, although you're both behaving like children, you are both children so it makes sense. Refusing to play with a 12 year old ever again is immature, but you're 15, so you're not an arsehole for behaving immaturely. \n\nI'm sure that game was really important to you and your friends, and you're upset that your sister didn't see that. It doesn't sound like she was giving a fake apology, she almost certainly didn't realise how important it was to you, even if she understands what Minecraft is and how it works, that doesn't mean she would have anticipated your reaction. She's 12! And I'm not surprised she doesn't want to apologise to your friends, she's probably embarrassed and slightly intimidated by them. I find 15 year old boys kind of intimidating tbh and I'm an adult!\n\nHow long are you planning to avoid playing games with her? For the rest of your life?\n\nWhen my uncle was about 8 or 9 and my mum was about 14 or 15, she had a go playing a video game that my uncle had been working on for weeks, died and lost all of his progress. He was absolutely furious. Now, they look back and laugh, because they're both adults. Last summer, we went on a big family holiday to Scotland. I brought my Switch, and we all played together. Imagine if my uncle had said \"I'm not playing with Cathy because she lost all of my progress on a game 40 years ago!\" That would be stupid. So you'll have to give up on this eventually. \n\nWhy not give her another chance, explaining to her that you're still upset about the Minecraft thing and if she does anything like that again you will be really upset and won't play with her again for another 3+ months.", "Find a different video game to play if you don't trust her on Minecraft.\n\nI recommend sims 3, but then I've been playing that game on and off since I was about 15 so I'm biased.", "Yeah, I mean, we still watch movies together and I have played outside with her and stuff. But video games are off the table for me now. It's still clear I expect her to apologize to my friends. She still refuses to.", "She hasn't said why she won't apologize. She just refuses. Has refused it when I told her to, when mom told her to and when dad told her to.", "She did know what she was doing. She knows enough about the game and the way she did it was very deliberate and intentionally done. Done for fun. But she still went out of her way to destroy everything.", "Feels like your projecting your own sibling stuff on to OP.\nHis sister is 12 and a child - yes.\nBut this is the age where she should start to learn boundaries with her brother.\n\nShe\u2019s not in elementary/primary school anymore to be destroying her brothers stuff - and blame it on her age.\n\nYou mention he should forgive her and make her \u2018happy\u2019.\nShe made him and several other kids unhappy, because she wanted to have fun destroying their server, INTENTIONALLY!\n\nRemember she still refuses to apologise to everyone.\n\nThis is a reasonable punishment.\nHe still spends time with her, just not with something that is his personal hobby.", "We can do other things together and we do actually do other stuff together. But I don't trust her anymore.", "It's not just Minecraft. We never really played that together. It's the fact she went in and did that because she found it fun and she knew what she was doing. Also the fact she didn't just do it to me but to my friends as well.", "You\u2019re doing great. You\u2019re dad is the correct one here. NTA", "Think about it from her perspective. As a young girl, apologising to a group of older boys has to be very daunting.", "Welcome to having a child in your house. She\u2019s learning, testing boundaries. Your server was a casualty. It sucks, and it hurts. Do you think she wanted to permanently damage the two of yours relationship? Are you going to let her?", "They lost 2 days off progress on the server. She was surprised they were upset by her destruction. I agree she should apologize, but I disagree with your judgements. She\u2019s 12 and this isn\u2019t a pattern of behavior.", "Why don\u2019t you trust her? Is it because she doesn\u2019t want to face up to a group of older boys and is likely embarrassed? Or do you really think she\u2019s do something like that again, even after seeing how upset you were? Because if you really think she\u2019s that vindictive, then you wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with her at all surely?", "then she shouldn't have destroyed their stuff.  12 is plenty old enough to know that kind of bullshit won't fly.  and whining about her punishment isn't gonna help either.\n\ny'all are NTA, but your sister sure is.", "Right, a young girl finds it very daunting to apologize to a group of older boys but has no problem destroying their hard work FOR FUN \ud83d\ude44", "I think she thought I would be okay with what she did. She didn't just mess with me either and could have made my friends less willing to play with me.", "I think she could do it again. The fact is she knew how much work went into that server, she meant to do what she did and that made me lose trust in her. Other stuff I am willing to do with her but I am not risking her spoiling games like that again and ruining hard work.", "Yes... Have you met kids?", "There you go, she didn\u2019t know how attached you were and how upset you would be. Now she does. I don\u2019t care about the theoretical about things that didn\u2019t happen. \n\nYou continuing to not play video games with her isn\u2019t productive or nice of you. You said this happened \u2018during COVID\u2019 and you\u2019re still punishing her about it. \n\nYou\u2019re a teenager too, but take my advice. Forgive your sister and make her happy. You don\u2019t need issues in your relationship, and this grudge isn\u2019t benefitting anyone.", "Ok, you might be right and she might be going through a phase where she wants to break stuff as kids do especially when they\u2019re going through puberty. But surely there are games you can play where it\u2019s not possible to break anything? Like Mario kart? And there are things that aren\u2019t video games where she potentially could break things? That\u2019s what doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\nAs I say, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an arsehole but surely you agree with me that you would be an arsehole if you continued to refuse to play games with her even 40 years into the future? It just seems a shame if you both had a shared hobby and you never play games together again because she made one mistake. Obviously it was a very big mistake but I think you should hold the boundary for a bit longer so she knows you\u2019re serious, and then give her another chance.", "No, this happened in January. The server has existed since the start of Covid. There was more than two years of stuff in that server.", ">As I say, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an arsehole but surely you agree with me that you would be an arsehole if you continued to refuse to play games with her even 40 years into the future?\n\nBs. Your uncle is your uncle and OP is OP. They are two completely different people in two completely different scenarios. Stop projecting your case on OP. Your mother made an honest mistake once. OP's sister intentionally made multiple mistakes on many occasions. He can refuse to play video games with his sister even 60 years from now and still not the AH. He's not cutting her out of his life, he's just refusing to play video games with her because of her own actions. \n\nAlso, you said your uncle and your mother are cool now. But you never mentioned how long did it take for your uncle to forgive your mother's honest mistake? \n\n>It just seems a shame if you both had a shared hobby and you never play games together again because she made one mistake. \n\nThis is a minimalization of what she did. The sister did not make one mistake, she made several mistakes in a long period of time.\n\nTo elaborate:  \n_She destroyed her brother and his friends' hard work FOR FUN (first and biggest mistake).  \n_She brushed it off when her brother confronted her.  \n_She refused to apologize to him and only apologize when she realized he wasn't gonna play video games with her anymore.  \n_He told her to apologize to his friends & she refused.  \n_Her mother told her to apologize to his friends & she refused.  \n_Her father told her to apologize to his friends & she refused.  \n_Until now, she still refuses to apologize to his friends and try to cry and beg to avoid owning up to her mistakes. \n\n>Obviously it was a very big mistake but I think you should hold the boundary for a bit longer so she knows you\u2019re serious, and then give her another chance.\n\nShe knows OP is serious. It's just that her ego or whatever reason she has is more important than playing video games with OP for her to refuse to apologize to his friends (who she wronged).", "do you not have a backup?", "There was a backup but it didn't include everything that was on the server when she destroyed it. My friend's brother helped with the backup but we lost about two days of work with the backup.", "oh, you lost 2 days of work? It seemed from the rest of your explanation it was 2 years?\n\nShe made a mistake, but she is 12...", "12 is old enough to understand not to break people's things. We learn this in kindergarten. She fucked up, refused to apologize, and is reaping the consequences of her actions.", "We had a backup of the server but that backup was not entirely up to date. My sister did not know there was a backup though and the original server had over 2 years of work in it."]}
