It was the only thing I was buying.\n\nAt the grocery store I went to, there are self check-out lanes that do not have an item limit.  You can go with 1 item or 100.  I get in the shortest lane, and the person in front of me has already checked out, and is bagging her items.  She has a good amount of stuff still to bag.\n\nI scan my bag of lettuce, and then place it on the conveyor belt, so that the system can sense the weight of the item.  I take my hand, and hold it on the other side of the bag of lettuce so that it doesn't move down the belt and interact with the other customer's items.  I go through the process of paying.  She is still bagging while I am doing this.\n\nThe other customer is annoyed that I am ringing up my item, and tells me that I should have waited until she was done with bagging before I made my purchase.  I said, \"It's only one item\".\n\nSo, AITA?  Should I have waited for her to finish bagging before I started ringing up my item?  Or, was it OK because I made sure that my things didn't interact with hers, and she was free to take as long as she needed to bag.\n\nEdit:  I want to add, that this was a full grocery store checkout lane, not the kiosk with the computer and the bagging space together. I was at the front interacting with the computer, and the other customer was 5 feet away at the end of the lane bagging.

My store doesn't even have self checkout, so everything is bagged for them, and they still take forever. As long as you have enough space to pay and you don't bump into them at all, go ahead and pay. They can be mad or they can move faster. Definitely NTA", "NTA- just based on myself, I personally would rather you go ahead and use the register while I'm still bagging then to be holding people up. I used to do all my grocery shopping late at night due to my work hours and the store I went to only had like 1-2 registers open at that time. Most of the people coming in were only getting a few items and I would get all kinds of dirty looks from people who had to wait for me to ring up a whole cart full of stuff when they only had a few items. I even overheard a lady complaining one night saying \" who does their major grocery shopping this time of night?\" I was like \" a single mother who works 80 hours a week and this time of night is the only time I have to do it!\"", "I'm going with a light YTA because you should at least have asked if you could go ahead with your item. People are a bit more conscious of others being close to them the last couple of years, so a quick, \"Hey, I've only got one thing, do you mind if I scan it?\" could have gone a long way.", "NTA. It was one item. You hurt her in no way. I have seen this done many times usually with more than one item and have never seen any issue with it. Seriously can\u2019t imagine someone actually being upset by it. \n\nAlso, I wish more of the questions on here were so low stakes. The low stake questions tend to bring out a larger variety of perspectives.", "NTA. I literally don\u2019t understand what her problem was and she was way out of line. You stopped your stuff from mixing with hers, you didn\u2019t interact with her, you weren\u2019t in \u201cher space\u201d, and it\u2019s literally 1 item. I would be so grateful if someone did this while I was bagging. It\u2019d make me feel bad if someone was waiting on me while i frantically bagged a ton of stuff to get out of their way. Is she that self centered that she needs an audience of people watch her bag her stuff? People saying any other judgment are absolutely ridiculous.", "How were the tacos?", "NTA. I\u2019ve been annoyed when someone starts scanning their items and sends them on down the belt into mine while I\u2019m bagging. Even if it\u2019s something small, it\u2019s rude and makes me feel rushed. But you had one item, were conscious of where it was at all times, and didn\u2019t affect her in any way. You did fine.", "I say NTA. A cashier where I live would have started checking out the person behind me while I\u2019m still bagging!\ud83d\ude02No issue for me!", "NTA. OP had one item. Took them maybe a minute to pay for. And op stated the lady is 5 feet away. She can go on with her business bagging and op wouldve been gone before she even finished.", "I thought maybe it was one of those tiny little checkouts with like, a register and a bag next to it and you were literally shoulder to shoulder, and I was thinking it was a tough call. I mean, I would hate it if someone did that but I'm super sensitive about random people being too close to me. But a full on grocery lane? NTA even a little bit. We even have a local chain that has two bagging lanes because even with a cashier, it's expected that one customer will be done and still bagging, and the cashier will already be scanning the next person's items. Five feet is plenty of room for her to do her thing and you to check out. She doesn't own the lane, and if she wants to camp out she needs to come at a much less busy time.", "YTA. Slow down and wait your turn. You made the other person feel rushed. There was no reason to start your checkout before she had finished hers.", "NTA. No reason to not bag as you go. I\u2019ve never seen anyone do it any other way.", "NTA\n\nPeople using those longer self checkout need a second person with them. Otherwise they take too damn long bagging things up.\n\nYou had one item, didn't mix with their stuff, and its not their self checkout.\n\nThey can go to a cashier if they need to.", "YTA\n\nYou should have waited or asked. Basically she has the space until she's done bagging.", "This is why I love Aldi and their packing shelf", "NTA\n\nShe should have moved her items to the side to bag up. This is the policy in Aldi or Lidl.", "Eh, yta but not buy an insane amount. Respect other people\u2019s space and if they\u2019re not done with something, wait til they\u2019re done. It\u2019s just kinda rude, even if you were trying to not interrupt her bagging her stuff up. She wasn\u2019t done, and you overstepped on a social boundary.\n\nEdit: barely ta, and it\u2019s something that I might do if I was in a hurry and not being conscious of other people.", "NTA. Especially because you physically stopped your one item from running into hers.

You didn't do anything to interfere with anything she was doing, she's just upset that you exist, apparently.", "NTA grab and go!", "YTA - would it have killed you to wait until she was done using the station for you to get up in her space? Good god, I don't understand how some people never learned the concept of taking turns.", "NTA.  She was done with the register, you didn't touch her stuff or interact with her at all, there was no reason to wait on her to clear her stuff off the deck before ringing up your one item.", "I definitely don\u2019t like people entering my space like that in public. So I think this is a per person basis. To me, you would be pushy and I would feel extremely rushed and aggressively confronted .\n\nTo you, this is just efficiency. A harmless way to let her bag at her pace while you do you and ring up your own stuff. \n\nI always give people their space and I always try to remember that the person behind me may not view things the way I do.\n\nIn my eyes YTA, in some you\u2019re NTA. So just go with understanding it\u2019s all gonna be viewed a little differently person to person.", "YTA \u2013 You inserted yourself into her personal space. That's just awkward and unnecessary.", "NTA. One item. She needs to get over herself.", "Yta. Its like when youre in a buffet line and someone reaches into your space because they just cant wait even a millisecond", "NTA  You kept your stuff separate from hers and didn't interfere with her at all.  \n\nI actually like self check out when I have a handful of items. I can get it done quicker than a new checker could, anyway.", "NTA. People get so butt-hurt about the littlest things. Maybe she should have went through a line with a cashier/bagger. Some people have stuff to do and use the self-checkout as a faster means to get through the store.", "YTA depending on where you live, but I wouldn\u2019t care. In many places, it\u2019s generally considered an invasion of personal space (especially post-Covid). Having only 1 item isn\u2019t relevant-you think it is because it ensured that you didn\u2019t have to interact with the previous customer, but that person doesn\u2019t have the benefit of knowing that like you do.\n\nEdited to add that I\u2019m not a fan of the customer\u2019s behavior either. She/He could have ignored you, but as we aren\u2019t knowledgeable about her triggers, I can\u2019t judge enough to say ESH.", "YTA, mostly because even if you hold down your lettuce, you made the other customer's items mash together when the belt moved. Also it's just overall rude.", "YTA. Finishing up at the register (especially finalizing bagging or putting change back in your wallet) is already awkward enough. I can't imagine dealing with some AH who can't wait 2 minutes for me to finish up my turn at the register.  \n\n\nIt's like the slides at the playground all over again.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t in her way at all! It\u2019s pretty selfish of her to not want you to scan your one item while she\u2019s hogging up a self-checkout line with a ton of items - even if that\u2019s not the rule for the store, it\u2019s still rude.", "NTA and she's out of line.  Why should you wait another 10 minutes for her to putz around with her groceries when you literally had just one item to scan and run.  Some people will dig for anything to be upset about.  Ignore and move on.", "Nta\n\nYou're supposed to bag as you ring things up in a self checkout, her items should have already been in bags by the time she paid.", "Uhm\u2026 tbh idk it depends on the person. I personally wouldn\u2019t mind but i can see why ppl might think it\u2019s impolite or even rude.\nBut for me personally NTA", "I don\u2019t Y T A, I think she just felt flustered/rushed and your presence heightened it.", "Yta. Wait your turn. Even when it's inconvenient", "Don\u2019t you have the dividers you put on the conveyor belt? In the UK you put one down and start putting your shopping on the check out.

What I'm saying is, when I see someone behind me, and I get that feeling that I'm holding up the natural flow of operations, I get the hell out of the way. I allow people to go around me if I'm doing something that takes up more time. If what they're doing doesn't affect me at all, I encourage the cashier to help the other person while I sort out my nonsense to the side.\n\nThis happened to me twice just recently, once at a pharmacy because I had to leave the counter to find something that was now on the shelf in a nearby aisle instead of behind the counter like usual. It only took me a couple seconds to run and grab, but I was holding up the flow, and encouraged the lady behind me in line to move up and be served in my place while I ran to the aisle. She only took a few moments and then I fell right back in my place.\n\nThen it happened at a supermarket in the very same way OP mentioned, except I was the bagger. The cashier rang up all my stuff while I bagged. I was halfway done when he finished, so I paid, and he asked if he could help me bag. I could have held up the line and had him help me do something I could do myself. Instead, I urged him to take the next customer, which only had a few things, and that customer and I ended up walking out of the store at the same time. She thanked me for allowing her to squeeze in while I finished up, and we went our separate ways with smiles on our faces.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is there's rude ways to go about it, and this definitely doesn't seem to have been one of them. Some people just aren't conscious of others around them and harbor that \"me me\" attitude. We all have lives and we all have things we're rushing to get to. There's no reason for this to have upset the bagger or become any kind of confrontation.\n\nYES - People are still very weird about the social distancing thing, and rightfully so. I still wear my mask in stores whether it's required or not just because I'm used to the precautions we've all been taking day in and out for the last few years. But distance wasn't a problem in this situation.\n\nYES - People can get defensive or feel rushed in this kind of situation, but it was one single item that didn't affect the bagger in any way, shape, or form. OP wasn't rushing the bagger out of the area so they could bag their own things. OP clearly didn't even interact with the bagging area since they weighed the item and then picked it up so it didn't go near the other customer.\n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sure the bagger in this situation also despises those plastic sticks people put down on the conveyor between customer purchases. God forbid your items touch the conveyor while mine are touching it.\n\nWould bagger feel defensive and rushed if their clothes were in the dryer and I put mine in the washer, or should I let the vacant machine go unused for an hour and a half while their downy fluffs? D:", "You're only a Jr AH here.   Ever hear of personal space & C19, another 120 seconds isn't a lot of time to wait for you to not crowd her.", "Soft YTA but only for not asking first, from my perspective it would have given me mad anxiety if someone did this unexpectedly while I was packing my stuff or made me feel like I was a serious irritant by taking too long, there wasn't a massive cause for the other person to get annoyed but I would be pretty stressed in this situation", "NTA You didn't get close to her, you're fine. I would have been grateful that you didn't wait on me.", "NTA, but only because I learned that some places have full size checkouts for self checkout? Wut. That's a dumb waste of space that is bound to be slower than a smaller kiosk that allows you to bag as you go. At a smaller checkout you'd be the clear AH since you're getting in someones personal space, and I'd still ask first next time, but you're okay here.", "NTA. I've seen dividers that are available to separate the orders while bagging. It's more efficient and didn't harm her or her things.", "NTA because it was one item.  I've had people do this where they're shooting stuff down the conveyor into my groceries and those people suck.  You had one item, managed it so it didn't come into contact with her groceries, kept the line moving while she bagged, and got yourself out of the store.  Maybe she felt rushed, but you weren't actively interfering with her bagging, so I say it was fine. \n\nThough I do agree with the folks who suggest that you could have alerted her that you only had the one thing.  That might be a strategy for next time.", "I went to the grocery store yesterday and got about 10 - 15 things. Checker rang me up, took my money and then said that she would bag my order after she rang the lady behind me who only had a gallon of water. No problems. Very little delay.\nIt's always best to ask first.", "I am confided why self-checkouts have a belt, but NTA.", "NAH, \n\nYou kind of went against unwritten social rules of self checkout. It\u2019s typically one person at a time and the space is yielded after the person is finished. \n\nI understand why she was annoyed, but at the same time, you didn\u2019t actually disturb her in any way.", "I see what you're saying, but still the other people in line have as much right to use the self checkout lanes and take their time as you do. So yeah, YTA. \n\nI absolutely hate it when people do this. I'm aware you're waiting. I'm trying to get my stuff bagged. I have social anxiety and when people do this I feel even more rushed and in the way. BUT if someone is in line behind me with a single or few items and I have a full cart I offer to let them go first (assuming I'm not already in the process of scanning.)", "NTA with one item in my opinion. She felt rushed even though you did not intend that to be the case.", "YTA", "Gonna go with a light YTA\n\n\n\nIt's not like you were on your way to perform heart surgery or something, you were just buying lettuce. Why couldn't you wait the 30 seconds for her to bag her groceries? I hope your tacos tasted awful.", "NAH.  I see your point, and I see her point.\n\nI, personally, am inclined to lean your way, based on your description of it as a full-sized checkout lane with a self-payment terminal bolted on at the front.  But I also see her take.  For example, some stations would throw a shit fit about 'please place your item in the bagging area.'\n\nJust shrug your shoulders and move on with your life.  As you say, low stakes.", "I really don't care if you are TA or not - but OMG!! I cannot stand people who spend forever bagging their groceries while others are waiting. I haven't seen this as much of an issue with self-checkout but there are the people who expect the cashier to bag every item, the people who don't want too many items in any one bag, the people who didn't bring enough bags, the people who have to pitter and patter and fuss about everything. This is just a crabby vent but people, please! Be prepared, make the process go quickly. We all have other things to do!!", "I'd second this, and I am notoriously impatient in checkout lines (I hold it in, but it does bug me.  First world problems)", "Personally I would feel MORE rushed if I saw someone waiting for me to finish bagging my items. By OP going ahead, the lady had more time to bag without holding up the line. \n\nI\u2019m so confused by all the Y T A votes!", "How would that rush the other person?  Paid, grabbed and left.  Cashiers do it all the time.  are they all assholes too?", "Not that kind of self checkout lane.", "~5ft is not personal space in any way", "Lmao he litteraly had one single item. It is dumb to wait ten minutes when you can finish before her", "> I would have been very happy if the dude had stopped his crap from running into mine.\n\nStolen comment.", "I find it very frustrating when people with a cart full of stuff use self check-out. I know there was no limit, but it kind of seems like it\u2019s an unspoken rule to only use it when you have 15 items or less. NTA", "My grocery store has the exact same set up he talks about. There is a conveyer which weighs the item as it moves and dumps it in a bagging area. And if you step away from the scanner to throw things in bags it starts beeping \"If you are finished scanning please press 'Finish and pay.'\" There is no real way to bag as you go without having a second person. And they don't send baggers to the self lanes.", "Edit wasn't there when I commented, but I stand by my statement. \n\nSomeone can't start ringing up their things if you pay after you've done everything else, including bagging.", "Where I live, sometines self checkout is the only thing open.\n\nI HATE self checkout most of the time (I rarely go in for just 1 or 2 things).  So I get so angry when I roll up with a cartful and find that I can't use a normal register.", "At one local grocery in my area you have to ask an employee for any bags after you scan your items.", "At mine you have no choice. The anti theft item weighing thing loses its shit if it detects the weight of bags on the shelf before you're done paying and locks up and requires manager bypass, which takes about 5 mins if you're lucky before someone gets around to noticing the issue and coming over there. So unless you want to fuck up the line and make your trip like 4x as long, you have to check out and then bag.", "They do, and it drives me up the damn wall. Just take the 10 seconds to let the scales register your bags on the shelf at the start, and pack as you go. \n\nThankfully the stores I go to have \"scan as you shop\" options as well so you can literally just scan the checkout barcode, pay and leave \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nBut yeah, on the rare occasions I'm at the normal self checkout I mostly just seethe inside at how oblivious people are.", "At my store that has this, there\u2019s a little gate that swings out to separate your stuff from the previous person who might still be bagging\u2026 so I feel like this is a normal thing to do. But maybe they don\u2019t have the gate (OP used her hands)", "I don't know about elsewhere but our Kroger has always been a bit aggressive about how long you have to bag items between scanning and not letting you take bagged stuff off the bagging area. So I've frequently found myself piling my items in the area to keep the machine from yelling at me.", "\"If you have finished scanning...\" haunts my dreams. The machine will start fussing in the amount of time it takes to remove a full bag to the cart and open a new one. I only shop in the middle of the day on a weekday or at opening time on Saturday morning now so there's no one waiting around as I toss stuff in the bagging area and then bag it strategically.", "I still haven't recovered from when they changed the voice and we got tomatoes because the energy was, \"Put your *CLUSTER TOMATOES* in the bag.\"", "Hmm. That's getting a bit close to her personal space. I'd have waited."]}
