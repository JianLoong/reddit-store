Please note, legally, he cannot take away any money you have earned or anything you have bought with your money if you are in North America or Europe, mileage varies elsewhere. In the US he also can\u2019t take away anything that\u2019s explicitly been called \u201cyours\u201d that was \u201cgifted\u201d to you, but that\u2019s harder to enforce. \n\nHim throwing away your brother\u2019s shoes was straight up illegal, just like beating your brother would be, which I only say to illustrate that it\u2019s irrational and just because other people in your family are enabling it does not make him right and you wrong. This is weird on his part, as is the doubling down.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your dad sucks.", "Nta. Your dad sounds like a piece of work, and mega controlling. Especially considering you even help him pay the bills- he has no room to talk to you about what you do with your extra money! What you did was an act of kindness, and not a waste. I hope you have the opportunity to get out of that household as soon as youre able. Good luck to you and your brother with your dad and the shoes. Do what you need to survive in that house especially at your age but if you have room to stand your ground, stand your ground. This is abusive behavior from your father towards both you and your brother and if you dont stand your ground to it, itll enable it further. I'm sorry you are living there and going through this. Please remember that just because your family is taking his side in this moment it doesnt mean you are wrong. I have a hunch this is a situation where they just want you to apologize rather than him because he is too hard to deal with/know that he wont but they want the situation over with so they put it on you.", "NTA Your father is abusive. Hide the shoes and ignore him until you can move out. Stop paying the bills. You will need that money to move out. It\u2019s your parents\u2019 jobs to provide for you - not the other way around.", "Sometimes, the silent treatment is a gift, not a punishment if you view it the right way.\n\nNTA - you are a kind sibling with a good heart."]}
