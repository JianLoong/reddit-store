Sorry for the long post.\n\nBefore my wife (30F) and I (32M) got married, we had already agreed that she would be a stay at home mom, as my job was enough to support us. She would cook, clean, and take care of our children. There was never any issue with this until now.\n\nFor a little background, we have 3 kids, two of which are in elementary school, and one is almost years old. My wife also used to have an impulse buying issue, where she would invest or buy large amounts of things we don't need, so I decided to give (both) of us a budget of $500 each month to spend on fun stuff or stuff we only *kind of* need. I also work long hours, so when I get home for dinner it's usually around 6-7.\n\nAnyways, one day we installed a baby monitor in the baby's room, and I often checked up on the baby during my lunch break. One day during lunch, I overheard my wife talking to another person, who she instructed to clean, cook, and take care of our child. At first I thought it was one of her friends, which I thought was a bit weird, but later I learned that every month she uses some of her \"fun\" money to hire someone to cook, clean, and take care of our child. I have nothing against hiring help, but there are two facts I'm a bit confused about. One of them is about how she lied to me, and specifically went behind my back, but the other one is a bit more complicated. (I have not confronted her yet) I don't necessarily know how I feel about her, as a SAHM hiring help to do her job for her? I work long hours, yet she doesn't have to do anything all day. Then again, it is HER money that she can use for ANYTHING she wants so... WIBTA if I confront her and ask her not to?\n\nI also learned later that she even hires people from task rabbit to put together shelves etc. Basically anything that she doesn't feel like doing, she pays someone else to do.\n\nEDIT: I now realize that I was 100% the asshole, but I realize I didn't make clear how long this has been going on for.

If she wants to use her \"fun\" money to hire a babysitter for a couple hours, that shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nBut, hiring someone to watch your kids is something she should have talked with you about first. I get the feeling she did it because you have some unrealistic ideas of what her day is like. How much of a break is she getting when you come home? Little to none, I suspect.", "You WBTA for asking her to stop hiring help with her discretionary funds - with the exception of childcare, because it\u2019s reasonable that you be involved in the selection of your child\u2019s babysitter, if you want to be. \n\nIt is worth investigating why she lied to you. Is she dishonest or does she feel judged by you? It\u2019s also fair if you\u2019d like to discuss the possibility of her returning to the workforce.", "Thank you all for your opinions, I now realize that I was being very ignorant about what she does all day, and very idiotic.

I think help is fine, she just should have told you", "Info: How often does she hire work?\n\nInfo: How much house work and child rearing do you do?\n\n[Edit based in additional info from OP:]\n\nTo update the post with info, she has hired help almost daily for about 3 months and he assists with all housework and kids on the weekends and does some chores when he gets home due to his hours during the week. Seems the statement \u201cI work long hours, yet she doesn't have to do anything all day.\u201d may be because she isn\u2019t currently doing any of the SAHM duties at the moment\n\nI think you and your wife need to sit down and talk. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask her why she needs so much help and discuss hiring occasional help during the week and vetting options TOGETHER if she is feeling overwhelmed. You have the right to know who is interacting with your kids too.  But demanding a full stop could be an AH move if she feels like she gets no help during the week\n\n\nThe following is the original response, keeping it in for context\n\nYou two need to talk about this. If you aren\u2019t helping her with house work and child rearing on a daily basis, then yes, youu would be\n\nEspecially with this toxic viewpoint of (and I\u2019m quoting you here) \u201cI work long hours, yet she doesn't have to do anything all day.\u201d\n\nThis is something we see a lot. I work a \u201creal\u201d job so you have to take care of everything at home. Being a stay at home parent is hard because it NEVER STOPS. She is working literally 24/7. These spouses with your expressed viewpoint usually have this toxic home responsibility division. Having some help is not a bad thing\n\nAnd they usually don\u2019t help out at home because \u201cthey make the money\u201d. But like I said, you get days off. You go off the clock everyday. She doesn\u2019t. Kids always need parenting. Dishes and laundry always have to be done. Houses always have to be cleaned.  Meals always have to be made. She doesn\u2019t get to clock out EVER if you don\u2019t help her, so she may be getting the help you should be giving from a paid helper. And having a young kid around can make these things hard to do solo. \n\nNow I agree, this is usually something that couples should discuss. But I have a feeling you have expressed that you don\u2019t have to help with these things because you have an outside job.  If she is using her \u201cfun money\u201d to get a break with something you don\u2019t help with and she never gets a break from otherwise, then you world be a serious AH", "Unpopular opinion but I say NTA for a couple of reasons.... The first which is huge to me is you're both the parents so decisions regarding the kids should be made together. I would be livid if i found out my son's father was hiring people to care for him DAILY and i was never told. If this was an occasional thing to get a break that's one thing but that's your home and kids too, if this is a daily thing you should have been consulted. Noteworthy but kind of irrelevant: if it was an afternoon a week or something i think it should come from shared finances and not be entirely her responsibility to pay for. Additionally I'm confused by the people upset that you said she's doing nothing all day because \"kids and the home is a real job.\" It absolutely is but that's the issue, she's not doing that, she's outsourcing it so she can do whatever she wants. I would absolutely feel betrayed if i were you to find out months down the road that you have no idea what's going on every day in your own home.", "This is pretty unfair assertion\n>she doesn't have to do anything all day\n\nHow many hours / month of help has she hired? I doubt it's significant, considering the budget.\n\nYTA", "Nta it doesn't seem like she's doing much at all", "Do you cook, clean, and do child care on evenings and weekends? If not, she\u2019s working all day, into the evenings, and on weekends. She needs a break, and if you don\u2019t want to take on some of that work to give her one, you should be hiring someone to do it every once in a while together. It\u2019s a conversation I think she should have approached with you, but she did spend her own allotted money on it at least. If it\u2019s something that really eats at you, take a week off work when you can and have her do nothing, or go away. Watch the kids, cook, and clean (and not just enough to get by, but to the standards try at she does and you expect) for the week and see how much work it is. She is absolutely NOT doing nothing all day and if you have any doubt in that you need to step into her shoes to appreciate what she does. If you\u2019re against the idea because you don\u2019t want to spend your time off doing all that work, consider that she doesn\u2019t get any full vacation off at all then, so using yours to take her role and free her time up makes sense. Plus, if you truly think she has nothing to do so much of the time, then it should still be a break for you. \n\nI think, given what you\u2019ve said, YTA, but the info above would help.", "So you think she does nothing? Send her on vacation... by herself. Anybody want to bet how many days he can do before he craters?? I think 3 days.\nYou get the kids, the schedule the housework (never ending) grocery shopping, cooking and clean up. Make sure homework is done. By yourself no calling family in to take them cause you really need to get some sleep.", "Edit: \n\nESH\n\nIf you can afford hiring help for your kids, it should be encouraged to help reduce the stress of raising 3 kids.\n\nHowever, not telling you about hiring people is a crazy breach of trust. It\u2019s also your home and children. You should have a say in who enters your house and who helps raise your kids.", "YTA - you do have vacation time at work? You know the time you take to get away from work. This is her time that she uses her fun money for. Why call it fun money if you can't spend it so you can have time away to have fun.", "YTA it's her money to spend and taking care of small chidern is not an easy task", "Oh boy this is a big one! If there weren't kids involved I would say she can do whatever she wants with her money. However, anyone that watches your children should be thoroughly vetted by both of you! Now if this was a relative that just needed a few bucks and wife wanted a break I could get her doing that on her own. But if she's hiring somebody from outside the family/friends group then yes you absolutely 100% have a right to know and see the person's credentials, plus meet the person before they ever see your child!\n\nPlus the fact that you have three small children in the household, you should not have a rotating cast of characters coming through the house to do little part-time jobs here and there. I don't know how to say this nicely, but these are people that don't have regular jobs, right? They can't hold down a job and your wife is basically opening the door for them and letting them take a look around at what you own. That just doesn't sound smart to me.", "Yta, \"she doesn't have anything to do all day\" except take care of the kids and house. Get the school agers off to school, run errands, grocery shop, meal plan, clean, cook, book appointments, plan around the kids schedules. So what if she hires someone to helpnout once in awhile to get a break? \n\nShe obviously can't be hiring someone fulltime for only $500/month.", "YTA. It is her money, and if that's how she wants to use it then she can. A SAHM is doing a full time job anyway, it's a good thing that she can get help.", "I feel like we need more info. Is it your wife\u2019s choice to be a SAHM? Is she happy with it?", "YWBTAH.  If she's using her spending money as she likes, you agreed.

Seriously?!? Picture your life without her for a moment, and now imagine how much money you have to spend on childcare, a cleaner, and a personal chef. \n\nI also work long hours, but I can guaran-fucking-tee that my husband, who is also a stay-at-home dad, works LONGER hours. Raising children and running a household is HARD WORK. \n\nLike everyone else said, it's her damn money to spend the way she wants.\n\nDo better.", "NTA.\n\nWho is going to be taking care of your child should be a team decision.\n\nAlso if she's not going to watch your kids, how about getting a job instead?\n\nAlso major red flag that she didn't tell you about it.", "Yta. \n\nYou go to your job Monday to Friday, you come home and leave your work at work.\n\nA stay at home parent is on duty 24 hours a day. You do her job for a week and see if you don't want some time off.\n\nShe should have talked about bringing in help or what help she needs if overwhelmed at times.", "YWBTA the fact that you are asking the question disingenuously means you already know the answer. Don\u2019t hide behind words and false narratives.", "NAH...\nYour wife has a lot of work to do.. being a SAHM is not to be underestimated.. so its okay if she needs help and uses her money to pay for it.\n\nBut. She should never have kept this in the dark. You are just as much a parent as she is, beinf a SAHM doesnt mean you get to make all the decisions yourself.\nIf this help is active in YOUR home around YOUR children then you should get a say in who you hire!", "WNBTA. Look, being the primary care giver is monotonous. It\u2019s absolutely great if you can break up that monotony so you can remember how much you love the kids.And hiring for people for taskers is less of a thing.\n\nBut no one cares for a kid like a parent. The whole idea of being a sahm is that the kids are going to get way better care. (Also, for a lot of people that aren\u2019t you it\u2019s not financially possible to hire care.) So yeah she\u2019s being dishonest about how much of that awesome superior care she\u2019s actually giving. And if that\u2019s part of the reason your willing to grind it out while she has a possibly leisurely life it might not be right. Unless that\u2019s not the whole picture.", "YTA.\n\nBeing a SAHM is a seven day a week job.  It's completely understandable why someone would need a break.", "Sort of WBTAH. I\u2019d definitely have a problem with someone coming in my house who I didn\u2019t know watching my kid/s and never even finding out. Even if she\u2019s home- does she ever leave while this is going on? Who the heck are they? Background checks? What about the random workers? A regular cleaning person once a week or two/ whatever- that\u2019s her choice, her funds etc. Childcare is a safety issue- those are not just her kids. What if there was an emergency? And the biggest issue was the secrecy. Maybe she knew you\u2019d be judgy? Time for better communication and mutual appreciation and support all around.", "Yes YAAH!", "NTA with a condition.\n\nYou do need to communicate expectations of how you are going to work together to raise and care for that family. If she just started doing it and you really found out in the moment, not with her telling you her intentions there is something weird there. Almost like potentially shame for spending money in that manner and it was hidden.\n\nBig bad take as others have pointed out is thinking that you have a job and she has a job and she's \"cheating\" her job. You only have one life, if there are shortcuts to make it enjoyable and it brings no negative effect to others why not use it?", "NTA.  I would be very worried indeed about who was in my house and exactly who was raising my child. It sounds like discussion needs to happen here.", "NTA as a working mum with no help I do all your wife does in less time, she doesn't need help", "How is she able to hire people to come almost every day if she only has 500 a month? That's not even enough for one person if they're coming regularly, unless 500 a month is worth a lot where you live.", "NTA\n\nI have read your comments and all the weird lies your wife tells is strange. I would be concerned too.\n\nMaybe she is bored? Maybe getting a job outside of the home would be a healthy outlet? A chance to socialise with other adults.\n\nYour kids are in school now so don't need a parent there 24/7.", "NTA: who watches your kids should be a mutually agreed upon thing. Also the lying, you can\u2019t have trust if she\u2019s lying to you.", "I think what is happening is that your  expectations are so high for your wife that she is embarrassed about needing help and feels you would judge her for it. Think of it like this. Do you get a lunch break? She doesn't. She doesn't get bathroom breaks or any kind of respite. If she needs to hire someone to do the dishes or clean the house, or to just give her a break through the day, that should be something she should feel comfortable bringing up to you. I can tell by your comments about her having nothing to do all day that you haven't spend much time caring for a toddler, older kids, and keeping the house clean. \nShe should absolutely talk to you about who she is paying to watch the kids but other than that I would say YTA for not being supportive, or creating the illusion that she cannot talk to you about this.\nIt does sound like she has some impulse control issues or is perhaps struggling with depression and that she feels alone. It's actually good that she has taken control of her impulse buying and is actually using that money to make her daily life easier instead of checking out/doing retail therapy. That's amazing. Perhaps you should talk to her about hiring a babysitter or mommy's helper for a couple hours a day or a day a week to give her a break. She probably feels overwhelmed and at least she's using the cash to limit her load instead of buying things she doesn't need. \nSo overall I'd say NAH depending on how you tackle the situation: do you \"confront\" her with the fact you've seen other ppl there over the security camera and blame her for not yelling her and judge her for needing help? Or do you ask het how she is feeling, how she is managing, and that you've seen some things on the footage and that you're wondering if you did something that made her feel like she needed to hide this from you, and ask if she needs some time off or help around the house? Inquire instead of judge. That's the difference between YAH and NAH.", "NTA \n\nchildcare arrangements are/should be a joint parental decision but she\u2019s gone behind your back and got someone in to do it all. That\u2019s out of order. Her getting people in to do minor tasks around the home isn\u2019t unreasonable because not everyone is competent or comfortable doing them. Her lies about hand making stuff that she didn\u2019t points to something else entirely. You need to sit down and find out what\u2019s really going on, if she\u2019s really feeling overwhelmed or if it\u2019s something else.", "No fucking way did you just walk on up here and say that she doesn\u2019t have anything to do all day. Yes indeedy you would be the asshole. You better change that attitude real quick because child support is gonna be a lot more than $500 a month for those maintenance-free kids you think you have.", "YTA. Taking care of 3 kids and a home is a lot of work. You feel that she is doing nothing all day and that shows you dont really know what youre talking about. \n\nSecondly, she is spending money from her allocation of USD 500/-. Its her money to sspend how she chooses. Why does it bug you so much? Do you feel like she is doing something out of your control? If yes it says a lot more about you\n\nOh and does she know you are monitoring the baby while youre in the office? If no, thats a major red flag for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
