Anna & I sleep in separate bedrooms while John sleeps in the living room (even though there's a bed in Anna's room, but he said he felt uncomfortable with that & we obviously aren't forcing him to do anything). \n\nI both study & have a part-time job, so most of the time I'm not in the apartment. I always make my bed, clean the dishes I use, pick up any wrappers, clothes, personal belongings etc. I've left behind. \n\nWhen my friends are over, I clean up after them & I've never made a mess & expected my roommates to clean it. I don't interact with Anna & John that much because I'm almost never around them, but I've been around enough to know that when John wakes up, the living room (which also doubles as a kitchen) looks like a pigsty. There's dishes everywhere, clothes on the floor, wrappers, deodorant & razors (yes, used razors) on the table & kitchen counters... \n\nHe never cleans it up himself because when Anna cleans her dishes & puts away her things, she cleans & puts away his stuff, too. I don't care because if she wants to do that, she can feel free to do so & I don't bother her. \n\nThe problem began earlier today, when she was washing his dishes & putting away his things. I was on a call with a friend about an important essay that I had to write, when she literally screamed at me to come help her with all of the garbage. \n\nI politely told her that I was busy at the time and had to meet my friend in twenty minutes, & that the trash John left behind was easily an hour of work. She started calling me lazy, yelling at me that I never help her when she cleans, that I just go out all day, etc. \n\nWhen I said I clean up after myself & asked her why she wasn't screaming at John even though he's the one that left the apartment looking like a bomb explosion site, she said, \"Because he's a guy and that's just not expected of them to know. *You* should know better. Women from my country know this, guys aren't really bothered by messes so it makes sense why he wouldn't clean.\" \n\nThe whole time she was yelling & calling me lazy, a pig, etc. & I told her, \"I have no obligation to clean up after a man I don't know, and neither do you. When I leave to study in your country & start living off of it is the moment I'll share your values but for now, I don't really care about them.\" \n\nShe got even angrier, started insulting me personally & a bunch of other things, & I told her that if she likes how the women in her country behave *that* much, then maybe the solution to her problems is that she should just go back to her country & leave me alone. \n\nI think I might be the asshole because she's a product of the environment she grew up in & maybe part of it isn't her fault. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670278267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdlo4b/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_to_go_back_to_her/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was prepared to let you have it, but your statement actually made sense in context.  When you move to a new country and live with people from that country, you should be ready to be accepting and tolerant of that country's customs.  If she's really so hung up on upholding her original country's traditions and customs, then she really should consider going back.  I'm saying this as a first generation immigrant to the United States.", "NTA. Everyone is responsible for cleaning up after themselves.  Anna is enabling John and John is using Anna.

She cements herself into being an asshole by descending into the name calling mode.", "You know, this might be the one case where \"go back to your country\" is actually a valid thing to say. Anna is going on about how women in her country know how to clean up after men, and that men are all slobs who aren't bothered by cleanliness, and demanding that you act in a way that she considers culturally normal in wherever-she-comes-from.\n\nSo I'm saying NTA.", "Nta \n\nI was going to day yes BUT she started with the country thing and was on a high horse \n\nThis is a shit living arrangement.

John is continuing to behave like an untrained animal because she is enabling it.  She needs to learn to draw boundaries and quit abusing you and calling you names because you don't buy into her misogynistic world view.", "NTA - she was trying to push her values onto you. I don't think it's wrong to say what you did in this particular context to remind her that if she is living in a different country she has to respect their values or go back to hers if she can't. It would be different if you tried to criticize her way of life and then because you did not like her cultural values told her to go back to her country.  \nHowever I'd have a serious talk with her on how she has to respect your values just as you respect hers and that calling you names is not allowed. Also you two should talk to John and decide if you want him to move out if he does not start picking up after himself or she can continue picking up after him.", "NTA she is the one who brought up her country", "Tell her lazy pigs come in both sexes.

You have no reason to clean anyone's messes but your own and you are right, if the culture where she is living is unpleasant to her then the obvious solution is to live somewhere with a culture she likes.", "NTA!!!!

She shouldn't be enabling John's behaviour and making you share in her crazy rationalisation of that enabling. You need clearer boundaries as flatmates, and if you're going to have someone sleeping in the living room (far from ideal) then they need to be someone who can clean up after themselves. John is obvious an asshole because he thinks it's ok to leave the place a mess and have other people clean up after him.", "YTA for the bigoted statement, but everything else is understandable.you shouldn\u2019t be cleaning other people\u2019s mess, but you also shouldn\u2019t make such rude statements to your friend", "ESH. I understand why you were frustrated, you shouldn't have to be the babysitter of two grown ass adults, however of all things you could've said you said something racist? Really?", "YTA for throwing out a stereotypical, inflammatory comeback. Your frustration is understandable and even your specific frustration regarding her perception that it is not a man's job to clean up after themselves and that you are responsible for your roommate's mess solely because you are a woman. That being said, you did exactly what she did by telling her to go back to her own country, which is to become defensive when faced with cultural standards that differ from your own.\n\nYou're right, she is the product of her upbringing, as much as you are of yours and in her eyes, you were as wrong as you believe her to be. Knowing that, there could have been a more empathetic conversation around the differences in expectations based on cultural upbringing and what specifically everyone's responsibilities are within the household. I don't blame you for responding as you did, but it was a missed opportunity for both of you to learn something and to develop a more holistic understanding of one another.\n\nEdit: everyone else obviously sucks too. John for being lazy and allowing others to clean up after him and Anna for enabling his lazy/misogynist attitude and yelling at you for not doing the same.", "ESH\n\nShe was rude, you were rude.\n\nYou could have left it at \"You're not in that country anymore\" and left it at that.\n\nYour point was correct, your delivery was over the line.\n\nSuggested verbiage:\n\n*I am only going to clean up after myself. I am not going to clean up after you, and I am not going to clean up after John. We are not in your country and I am not a member of your culture. Even if we were, I'm a grown adult capable of making my own decisions and this is the decision I am making.*\n\n*If we all need to sit down and have a discussion about how chores are handled, let's schedule it. Otherwise, this is what I choose to do, and what you choose to do is up to you.*\n\nOutside of that I would suggest that you have this conversation, John included, and determine who is going to continue living there and what their responsibilities are going to be. Should have had the conversation when everyone moved in, but you're young enough to probably have not foreseen the need. Lesson learned for next time.", "YTA - You are right to be upset with your roommate not cleaning up, but instead of just arguing that you went full racist.", "ESH it sounds like she was majorly out of line, but \u201cgo back to your country\u201d is just an unacceptable thing to say, full-stop. Would you have felt justified in calling her a racial slur because of her bad behavior? No? This is the same thing. Please learn from this. \n\nBtw, it is not your responsibility to clean up for anyone else, so I agree she was 100% in the wrong there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
