First of all, thank you for all the attention and some of your comments were absolutely hilarious. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a field day going through all of them.\n\nA lot of people suggested just making my mom pay for the dress, but I was debating the suggestion of just being a guest (though a lot of you agreed with me to just not show up)\n\nI ended up calling my mom and was going to make a decision with however it went. She started off the conversation that she didn\u2019t need me to be apart of the wedding party because her and my dad were \u201chaving trouble having the best people\u201d (aka no one will do it again lol) so they were going to scratch that part of the wedding and it was \u201call about them anyway\u201d. So I told them I was coming as a guest and after I made plans with my cousin to give me a lift so I wasn\u2019t spending a single cent on going to their wedding.\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I go over to their house for dinner once a month so we went over there Saturday. As I mentioned before in a  comment or two, my fianc\u00e9 grew up financially insecure and so I struggle with convincing him to do something nice for himself once in a while. I did however just convince him to spend part of our savings to do a really nice honeymoon in Greece since we are doing a small wedding. It took some pulling of teeth but he now won\u2019t stop getting travel books and researching and it makes me so happy to see him excited about this. \n\nIt was a fairly pleasant dinner until my own wedding planning came up. I told them that we were pretty much set with the wedding, but we were having out details on Greece. My mom got visibly upset and excused herself and my dad followed. I was pretty confused but they came back and my dad calmly explained that my mom feels very hurt that I\u2019d be willing to spend thousands of dollars on my honeymoon but wouldn\u2019t shell out money for their wedding.\n\nI was pretty dumbfounded and said \u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nSo yeah I got kicked out of the house and uninvited from the wedding\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f not super torn up about it, and this is now my fianc\u00e9s favorite story to tell\ud83d\ude02 Happy holidays ya\u2019ll!", "created_utc": 1672245110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxdzcf/update_aita_for_not_going_to_my_parents_wedding/", "score": 8051, "replies": ["Congrats!

How can she even compare your own (first) wedding and honeymoon to her 4th failed attempt. How dare you invest in your own honeymoon when you could have thrown away the money for her pleasure!

Still NTA.", "Honestly, it sounds like your parents desperately need to be the center of attention and when they aren't they either get married to each other again or get a divorce.

I hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have a great wedding and beautiful life together. Try to use your parents as an example of what not to do.", "As a woman, I don't know either, but I suspect it's true", "Maybe they're religious?
