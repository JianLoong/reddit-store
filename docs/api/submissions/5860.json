First of all, thank you for all the attention and some of your comments were absolutely hilarious. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a field day going through all of them.\n\nA lot of people suggested just making my mom pay for the dress, but I was debating the suggestion of just being a guest (though a lot of you agreed with me to just not show up)\n\nI ended up calling my mom and was going to make a decision with however it went. She started off the conversation that she didn\u2019t need me to be apart of the wedding party because her and my dad were \u201chaving trouble having the best people\u201d (aka no one will do it again lol) so they were going to scratch that part of the wedding and it was \u201call about them anyway\u201d. So I told them I was coming as a guest and after I made plans with my cousin to give me a lift so I wasn\u2019t spending a single cent on going to their wedding.\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I go over to their house for dinner once a month so we went over there Saturday. As I mentioned before in a  comment or two, my fianc\u00e9 grew up financially insecure and so I struggle with convincing him to do something nice for himself once in a while. I did however just convince him to spend part of our savings to do a really nice honeymoon in Greece since we are doing a small wedding. It took some pulling of teeth but he now won\u2019t stop getting travel books and researching and it makes me so happy to see him excited about this. \n\nIt was a fairly pleasant dinner until my own wedding planning came up. I told them that we were pretty much set with the wedding, but we were having out details on Greece. My mom got visibly upset and excused herself and my dad followed. I was pretty confused but they came back and my dad calmly explained that my mom feels very hurt that I\u2019d be willing to spend thousands of dollars on my honeymoon but wouldn\u2019t shell out money for their wedding.\n\nI was pretty dumbfounded and said \u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nSo yeah I got kicked out of the house and uninvited from the wedding\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f not super torn up about it, and this is now my fianc\u00e9s favorite story to tell\ud83d\ude02 Happy holidays ya\u2019ll!", "created_utc": 1672245110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxdzcf/update_aita_for_not_going_to_my_parents_wedding/", "score": 4354, "replies": ["Congrats!

How can she even compare your own (first) wedding and honeymoon to her 4th failed attempt. How dare you invest in your own honeymoon when you could have thrown away the money for her pleasure!

This warmed my cockles.", "Pretty funny update really. Your mother likes to be centre of attention doesn't she? Still NTA.", "Honestly, it sounds like your parents desperately need to be the center of attention and when they aren't they either get married to each other again or get a divorce. Getting uninvited is for the best. Frankly, the rest of the family should stop indulging them and I'd bet money this nonsense would stop.

I hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have a great wedding and beautiful life together. Try to use your parents as an example of what not to do.", "As a woman, I don't know either, but I suspect it's true", "Maybe they're religious?

But I think at this point it has reached a level of ridiculousness that OP can just have fun with it.\n\nOP, first, call your Grandparents and explain what is going on and your Mom's ridiculous request. Tell them that you plan to have fun with the request (though you won't be purchasing the dress) but you need to know some background information from them.

Because you guys are planning and paying for your 4th wedding together, I haven't asked you to drop cash on mine.

They are obviously addicted to drama and attention. Combine that with their anger that you aren't complying with their wedding demands is a recipe for disaster at your wedding.\n\nAt minimum, your mom is showing up in a wedding dress, guaranteed. And they'll hijack your wedding speeches for another vow renewal of their own.\n\nThey are desperate for attention.

At some point they need some self awareness and it sounds like no one has it. At about my 5th step dad come on! What the hell do these people expect? Do we need to spell it out really? Things my mom got pissed off about, me suggesting a punch card, saying she can do X with her next husband,  saying just live with them - don't get married again. Sigh. It was hard for me too. If they need you to spell it out at some point, write a letter. Make if painfully clear to them and then take a good long break. I doubt it will help because they seem incredibly self absorbed.
