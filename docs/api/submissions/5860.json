First of all, thank you for all the attention and some of your comments were absolutely hilarious. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a field day going through all of them.\n\nA lot of people suggested just making my mom pay for the dress, but I was debating the suggestion of just being a guest (though a lot of you agreed with me to just not show up)\n\nI ended up calling my mom and was going to make a decision with however it went. She started off the conversation that she didn\u2019t need me to be apart of the wedding party because her and my dad were \u201chaving trouble having the best people\u201d (aka no one will do it again lol) so they were going to scratch that part of the wedding and it was \u201call about them anyway\u201d. So I told them I was coming as a guest and after I made plans with my cousin to give me a lift so I wasn\u2019t spending a single cent on going to their wedding.\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I go over to their house for dinner once a month so we went over there Saturday. As I mentioned before in a  comment or two, my fianc\u00e9 grew up financially insecure and so I struggle with convincing him to do something nice for himself once in a while. I did however just convince him to spend part of our savings to do a really nice honeymoon in Greece since we are doing a small wedding. It took some pulling of teeth but he now won\u2019t stop getting travel books and researching and it makes me so happy to see him excited about this. \n\nIt was a fairly pleasant dinner until my own wedding planning came up. I told them that we were pretty much set with the wedding, but we were having out details on Greece. My mom got visibly upset and excused herself and my dad followed. I was pretty confused but they came back and my dad calmly explained that my mom feels very hurt that I\u2019d be willing to spend thousands of dollars on my honeymoon but wouldn\u2019t shell out money for their wedding.\n\nI was pretty dumbfounded and said \u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nSo yeah I got kicked out of the house and uninvited from the wedding\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f not super torn up about it, and this is now my fianc\u00e9s favorite story to tell\ud83d\ude02 Happy holidays ya\u2019ll!", "created_utc": 1672245110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxdzcf/update_aita_for_not_going_to_my_parents_wedding/", "score": 637, "replies": ["Congrats! Enjoy Greece!", "I seriously can\u2019t believe your mom is trying to overshadow your wedding with her 4th wedding, not even waiting for you to have your moment!", "Sounds like the best outcome honestly, and I am still laughing about your mother being shocked that no one wants to give her the full treatment for her fifth or whatever wedding.\n\nI have an aunt who's been married something like 8 times, and the last two she just did a quick standup wedding in a garden type thing, because it turns out that no one wants to shell out money or buy presents for your fifth wedding to yet another loser.", "No worries, you can catch the next one (/s)\n\nYour vacation to Greece is more meaningful- and important. Happy holidays.", "I am glad you have a good sense of humor about this really unhealthy situation! Sometimes, that's the very best tactic in life. \n\nIt's the Mr. Bennett philosophy from \"Pride and Prejudice\" If you're unlucky enough to be surrounded by absurd people, at least enjoy the show.", "Great response! Have a fabulous time in Greece!", "Glad you and your fiance have a good wedding and honeymoon planned. \n\nSo I am from a poor background and moved into well paid working class. I have spent a pretty penny on myself, I could never pay $1500 on a dress let alone ask someone else to spend that. Can you share a link to this dress? \n\nSorry your parents are causing issues.", "Man that makes me feel good.  Especially since your mom dropped that shit about you not \"using your privilege correctly\" or whatever, just because you wouldn't shell out for her costume party.", "You, my dear, are a rock star! I love it! I hope you have exactly the wedding you want, the honeymoon of your dreams and wish you all the best!", "This is a good update to the other story. Can't help having parents like these", ">I was pretty dumbfounded and said \u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nThe way I laughed!!! \n\nGood for you. Don't go anymore to their weddings.", "Oh wow! You should be spending money on your first wedding and they should be ashamed of themselves.", ">\t\u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nMic drop.", "Your mom sounds like the type of person that if you were to end up in the hospital, after she got there all she would do is talk about how bad the traffic was and what an ordeal it was for her to get there.....\n  \ngood on you for getting fiance to go to Greece, enjoy!", "Your mom is hilariously over the top. She clearly loves all the drama. Congratulations on your honeymoon! Sounds dreamy! So glad you no longer have to worry about the 4th wedding. Although I bet momma drama llama won't be able to leave you alone lol.", "NTA, again.\n\nAnd you are the GOAT for that comeback \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "How ridiculous can one person be?\n\nI hope you have a wonderful wedding, and an adventure filled honeymoon.", "She is mad you're going on a honeymoon but won't spend thousands of dollars on her fourth wedding to the same guy? Your mom is deranged.", "Hahahaha, brilliant! Congratulations on your own wedding and have tons of fun in Greece!", "Aw congratulations have a fabulous wedding and honeymoon,  I love Greece too. You and your fiance are sensible about money, you will do well in life.", "Your parents need to understand your not a yo! Yo! \n\nAnd nor are your friends they cannot expect everyone to shell out money for continuous weddings!\n\nThey should honestly be not wanting to constantly put of their friends.\n\nI am actually going to go against the grain and say if they rarely Fight they maybe should be together.\n\nBut they need to work on actually staying together.\n\nSince you do have funds I would meet them in the middle and say no money for them at this time.\n\nBut if they can stay together no separations and  no divorces for let\u2019s say 10 years then you will be happy to throw them a Party\n\nIt\u2019s fine if they want to get married again but they can show their commitment to each other but actually sticking together.", "Your mom is mad you won\u2019t pay to go to her fourth wedding with the same man she\u2019s been with for years? It\u2019s common knowledge what people do for their own wedding isn\u2019t what they\u2019d to for someone else\u2019s. Also, why don\u2019t they just go to therapy? Or just schedule an annual giant party? Or have an open marriage if they get bored once in a while with each other. They are very weird and clueless. People aren\u2019t trying to interrupt their lives every few years because your parents want attention.", "Geeeez. How can she even compare your own (first) wedding and honeymoon to her 4th failed attempt. How dare you invest in your own honeymoon when you could have thrown away the money for her pleasure! My eyes are rolling in my head. I'm not sure about your father, but your mother sounds very self-centered.", "no, you will catch their next ones!", "Oh lordy. Your parents are a trip. Enjoy your happy life and don't let those two...people....disturb you further.", "NTA for this one as well.", "It's so absurd, even without any of the extra context, to say \"I can't believe you're willing to shell out thousands of dollars for your OWN HONEYMOON and not for a  $1,500 dress for me\". I'll give people a few hundred for a wedding gift and dress up fancy, but obviously my own wedding is my priority. In what universe would it not be?", "Honestly, at this rate, just go no contact with your parents because it sounds like they are a piece of work and a headache. Congrats on your wedding and have a ball on your honeymoon. You and your future husband.", "It\u2019s not easy to upstage Elizabeth Taylor, but damn.", "Hilarious, thanks for the update!! Contact Netflix and sell the movie rights! I am serious, that would be a comedy I'd watch! No need to a full story, the context is enough and the writers will fill in the rest! Seriously, give it a try! This would make your parents so much more annoyed.", "Hahaha", ">\u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nLMAOOOOO", "Hahahaha!! This whole story is so weird and I love your comment about only getting married once.", "Your fianc\u00e9 is far more important than your parents.  You chose him and you didn\u2019t choose your parents.  Good for standing up for him!", "That is what is called a perfect mic drop! Well done and enjoy Greece!!", ">So yeah I got kicked out of the house and uninvited from the wedding\n\nTOTALLY WORTH IT. Good for you!!", "Bahahahahaha. This warmed my cockles.", "Pretty funny update really. Your mother likes to be centre of attention doesn't she? Still NTA.", "Honestly, it sounds like your parents desperately need to be the center of attention and when they aren't they either get married to each other again or get a divorce. Getting uninvited is for the best. Frankly, the rest of the family should stop indulging them and I'd bet money this nonsense would stop. I suspect the reason they keep doing it is because they keep getting the levels of attention they crave.", "Oh man, I love it when posters take the time to give us updates! Have a WONDERFUL time in Greece, and we\u2019ll be waiting for update number two in a few years about parents\u2019 divorce and wedding number five \ud83d\ude04", "Not only that, but her fourth wedding to the same person! These people have more money than they know what to do with, jfc.", "Someone needs to tell the parents that they can date without getting married.", "The mom's comment about them being willing to spend money on their own honeymoon but not her parents' fourth wedding to each other is just the kind of comment a wealthy narcissist would make. Not everything is about you, mom.", "I wonder if they or one of them is addicted to being the center of attention and throwing a big party. I heard once that one of the big reasons for weddings is because its as close to a princess coronation as they are likely to get which is why its a big deal to many women. I don't know if thats true (i am not a woman so...).", "5th wedding *to the same man*. \n\nWhich is like 10x worse. You already know it won\u2019t work the first 4 times.  It honestly just looks like an attention/gift grab.", "This \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23   considering OP parents ....there will always be another one \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yes - good on you OP for bypassing the drama of their wedding.  I hope YOUR wedding is fabulous and your honeymoon is awesome. Glad it appears that you aren't taking this whole thing with your parent's 4th wedding all that seriously.", "I really really really don't get why the mom couldn't just buy the damn dress for her. Oh wait, it's because she's a wealthy narcissist who doesn't understand how money works.", "For real. Like, they know that anniversary parties and vow renewals exist, right? Heck, even open marriages. They don't have to get divorced every time they want to throw a party.", "Wait, what?\n\nYou mean they can bang without having a wedding ring on her finger? /s\n\nI don't understand these parents, it feels like they are trying to use Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as marriage \"advisors\". I am truly curious as to why they keep marrying and divorcing, are they unable to work out petty differences? Are they serial cheaters? \n\nOP, thank you for the update. I hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have a great wedding and beautiful life together. Try to use your parents as an example of what not to do.", "As a woman, I don't know either, but I suspect it's true", "Maybe they're religious? No sex outside of marriage, so they get divorced to find another partner, only to realize that no one else can stand them, and then they give it another go until another potential partner arrives. I feel like OP's parents are using their privilege incorrectly."]}
