First of all, thank you for all the attention and some of your comments were absolutely hilarious. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a field day going through all of them.\n\nA lot of people suggested just making my mom pay for the dress, but I was debating the suggestion of just being a guest (though a lot of you agreed with me to just not show up)\n\nI ended up calling my mom and was going to make a decision with however it went. She started off the conversation that she didn\u2019t need me to be apart of the wedding party because her and my dad were \u201chaving trouble having the best people\u201d (aka no one will do it again lol) so they were going to scratch that part of the wedding and it was \u201call about them anyway\u201d. So I told them I was coming as a guest and after I made plans with my cousin to give me a lift so I wasn\u2019t spending a single cent on going to their wedding.\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I go over to their house for dinner once a month so we went over there Saturday. As I mentioned before in a  comment or two, my fianc\u00e9 grew up financially insecure and so I struggle with convincing him to do something nice for himself once in a while. I did however just convince him to spend part of our savings to do a really nice honeymoon in Greece since we are doing a small wedding. It took some pulling of teeth but he now won\u2019t stop getting travel books and researching and it makes me so happy to see him excited about this. \n\nIt was a fairly pleasant dinner until my own wedding planning came up. I told them that we were pretty much set with the wedding, but we were having out details on Greece. My mom got visibly upset and excused herself and my dad followed. I was pretty confused but they came back and my dad calmly explained that my mom feels very hurt that I\u2019d be willing to spend thousands of dollars on my honeymoon but wouldn\u2019t shell out money for their wedding.\n\nI was pretty dumbfounded and said \u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nSo yeah I got kicked out of the house and uninvited from the wedding\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f not super torn up about it, and this is now my fianc\u00e9s favorite story to tell\ud83d\ude02 Happy holidays ya\u2019ll!", "created_utc": 1672245110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxdzcf/update_aita_for_not_going_to_my_parents_wedding/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Congrats! Enjoy Greece!", "I seriously can\u2019t believe your mom is trying to overshadow your wedding with her 4th wedding, not even waiting for you to have your moment!", "Sounds like the best outcome honestly, and I am still laughing about your mother being shocked that no one wants to give her the full treatment for her fifth or whatever wedding.\n\nI have an aunt who's been married something like 8 times, and the last two she just did a quick standup wedding in a garden type thing, because it turns out that no one wants to shell out money or buy presents for your fifth wedding to yet another loser.", "No worries, you can catch the next one (/s)\n\nYour vacation to Greece is more meaningful- and important. Happy holidays.", "I am glad you have a good sense of humor about this really unhealthy situation! Sometimes, that's the very best tactic in life. \n\nIt's the Mr. Bennett philosophy from \"Pride and Prejudice\" If you're unlucky enough to be surrounded by absurd people, at least enjoy the show.", "Great response! Have a fabulous time in Greece!", "Glad you and your fiance have a good wedding and honeymoon planned. \n\nSo I am from a poor background and moved into well paid working class. I have spent a pretty penny on myself, I could never pay $1500 on a dress let alone ask someone else to spend that. Can you share a link to this dress? \n\nSorry your parents are causing issues.", "Man that makes me feel good.  Especially since your mom dropped that shit about you not \"using your privilege correctly\" or whatever, just because you wouldn't shell out for her costume party.", "You, my dear, are a rock star! I love it! I hope you have exactly the wedding you want, the honeymoon of your dreams and wish you all the best!", "This is a good update to the other story. Can't help having parents like these", ">I was pretty dumbfounded and said \u201cWell we are willing to have an expense on the honeymoon because we are only getting married once \u201c\n\nThe way I laughed!!! \n\nGood for you. Don't go anymore to their weddings.", "Oh wow! You should be spending money on your first wedding and they should be ashamed of themselves."]}
