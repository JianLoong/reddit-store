Anna is married to Gavin and has a stepdaughter Hazel (16F). Anna and Gavin have been together for 6 years and married for 4. Both girls live with Anna and Gavin full time due to Piper's dad being deceased and Hazel's mom being a deadbeat. Hazel sees Piper as her sister while Piper does not return the sentiment and really doesn't seem to like her very much. She's fine with her but doesn't like to hang out with her and always seems to see spending time with Hazel as a chore. This could be in part because ever since they moved in together Anna and Gavin have decided they will do certain things together every week and they do not get to say no to it. Hazel loves it but Piper hates it.\n\nBoth girls love The Hunger Games. Piper has read all the novels, including the newest one. Hazel is yet to read the latest novel. The girls also love the movies and so Anna and Gavin decided they would see the new movie together. Piper said she wanted to go with her friends but Anna told her she would go with her sister.\n\nPiper went to see it with her friends anyway and Anna found out. She asked Piper why and Piper told her she wanted to go with her friends, she wanted to enjoy seeing the movie and not be stuck with a burden while watching it. Anna decided to ground Piper and told her she will learn to love and appreciate her sister or she will end up grounded a lot until she moves out.\n\nAnna was annoyed that instead of being apologetic Piper just complied and has not shown any appreciation for Hazel since. She was telling me all this and I sarcastically told her that it's sure to help their family punishing Piper for going to the movie without Hazel, when she has been telling her for a while in different ways that she doesn't like Hazel. I also made a comment that forced proximity always makes relationships so much better. Anna told me I wasn't a parent of teens so I didn't get it and it was rude to sarcastically talk about her parenting.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703280411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18opdlf/aita_for_sarcastically_telling_my_sister/", "score": 2653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to stop pushing. \n\nIf she still doesn't get it, find someone she does not like at all and tell her she is going to spend time with this person until she loves them or else. \nIf she still doesn't get it, then she is a lost cause and deserves whatever happens.", "There is a good possibility that if Anna had just left them both to it themselves since the beginning Piper wouldn't mind having Hazel tag along probably even ask her to go.\n\nIt's getting forced to spend time together that's the problem nobody wants to be forced to spend time together it doesn't matter if its step siblings or blood siblings.\n\nEven if two people are genuinely close it can cause problems hell look at the Pandemic how many couples split up and families had fights \nbecause they were forced to spend time together with no way out of it now they could have spent just as much time together willingly with no problems because you know the door is there you know you can just walk away but getting forced into it is a problem.\n\nOn another subject.\n\nWhile its said Piper has friends to go with doesn't Hazel or could that be part of the problem from Hazel's side she doesn't actually have many or any other friends of course it could be she does have friends and it was more the point she thought they were going together  maybe she thought that was their special thing especially if she knows they aren't that close she thought this was the one thing they bonded over \nwhich could have hurt her feelings when she found it wasn't she may  even turned down a chance to watch it with friends or her friends simply aren't into that film or books just because you are friends doesn't mean you like everything each other likes.", "NTA\n\nIt's a basic rule of human nature.

Her comment on not wanting to see the movie with a burden was unnecessarily harsh. There isn\u2019t any indication in this story that the step sister did anything to merit that comment other than to ask the question and try to engage the daughter more. I simpler and truthful response would have been to say she really just wanted to see the movie with her friends. \n\nThe mother in this case may want to consider backing off pushing her daughter into more activities with the step daughter as that is obviously leading the daughter towards resentment rather than indifference.

Anna is married to Gavin and has a stepdaughter Hazel (16F). Anna and Gavin have been together for 6 years and married for 4. Both girls live with Anna and Gavin full time due to Piper's dad being deceased and Hazel's mom being a deadbeat. Hazel sees Piper as her sister while Piper does not return the sentiment and really doesn't seem to like her very much. She's fine with her but doesn't like to hang out with her and always seems to see spending time with Hazel as a chore. This could be in part because ever since they moved in together Anna and Gavin have decided they will do certain things together every week and they do not get to say no to it. Hazel loves it but Piper hates it.\n\nBoth girls love The Hunger Games. Piper has read all the novels, including the newest one. Hazel is yet to read the latest novel. The girls also love the movies and so Anna and Gavin decided they would see the new movie together. Piper said she wanted to go with her friends but Anna told her she would go with her sister.\n\nPiper went to see it with her friends anyway and Anna found out. She asked Piper why and Piper told her she wanted to go with her friends, she wanted to enjoy seeing the movie and not be stuck with a burden while watching it. Anna decided to ground Piper and told her she will learn to love and appreciate her sister or she will end up grounded a lot until she moves out.\n\nAnna was annoyed that instead of being apologetic Piper just complied and has not shown any appreciation for Hazel since. She was telling me all this and I sarcastically told her that it's sure to help their family punishing Piper for going to the movie without Hazel, when she has been telling her for a while in different ways that she doesn't like Hazel. I also made a comment that forced proximity always makes relationships so much better. Anna told me I wasn't a parent of teens so I didn't get it and it was rude to sarcastically talk about her parenting.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why does it have to be all or nothing when there\u2019s such a clear compromise?\n\nNTA obviously.", "NTA.  When will people realize that they can\u2019t force a relationship with step family?  All your sister is doing is making your daughter despise her stepsister even more than she already does.", "NTA. She probably does actually feel burdened by the fact her time isn\u2019t important and can be trampled whenever the need suits another. \nI can\u2019t fault her for daring to put herself first in this situation despite hurting the youngers feelings because she doesn\u2019t seem to have that intention she seems to desire personal independence.", "NTA, but to be effective, leave the sarcasm off and just speak earnestly and compassionately.", "NTA. You are very much correct, forcing Piper to hang out with Hazel will turn dislike into hatred. This will NOT help AT ALL.", "NTA.

This will only build resentment. \n\nThey need to make peace that they\u2019re never going to get the picture \u201cperfect family\u201d where everyone just gets along and is happy all the time.

It does not work. Anna\u2019s \u201cgrounded until you love Hazel\u201d approach will only build resentment. Not only for Hazel but Anna and Gavin too.", "NTA. Goodness she lost her dad and now her mom, who should have her back, is telling her that if she doesn't give up her own feelings and be a good enough sister she is willing to make her life full of suffering till she can't be forced anymore?

Just wait until Piper turns 18, moves out, and never looks back. Even Stevie Wonder can see this train wreck coming.", "NTA. If anything, What Anna is doing will just make Piper resent Hazel even more. Why shouldn't she have a social life without her stepsister? If Piper was being explicitly mean in excluding her I might understand but punishing her for not wanting to hang out with Hazel is unreasonable and unfair.", "NTA. Reality checks sometimes hurt.", "I\u2019m an only child. I definitely was glad after seeing the biological siblings go at it so much. Only downside was I had no one to blame to get out of trouble. Even when adults there\u2019s still a lot of fighting, ugh", "I'm a parent of teens.  You are absolutely right.", "NTA. If you can, see about setting some space aside for Piper? I have a feeling she'll be fleeing the nest ASAP once she turns 18, and will need somewhere safe to land.", "NTA. Forcing the two of them together is just going to make Piper resent her stepsister, especially since she's being punished for not spending time with her. Stepfamilies aren't always an easy family dynamic for teens to adjust to and while Piper could have been nicer about it (not calling her stepsister a burden), I imagine this has been going on for a long time and she's tired of it.", "NTA. Maybe you could have told your sister this seriously rather than sarcastically, but that probably wouldn't have worked either given her response was 'you're not a parent, you don't understand'. I'm not a parent, either, but I have nieces, and I have a sister. Pushing me and my sister together when we were kids just made our relationship worse. To be fair, that wasn't my mum, that was my nan doing that, my mum was fine with me and my sister hating each other as long as we weren't all out fighting, which did happen sometimes. That's probably the nicest thing I can say about my mum, though. \n\nHere's what's going to happen with your sister's strategy. Piper will continue not spending time with Hazel. She'll try even harder than she is right now to do things without her. She'll take the punishments, growing more and more resentful of Hazel, her mum, and stepdad each day. She'll possibly start acting out in other ways, too, as why not? She's going to get punished anyway. She'll tell her friends that the only way Hazel can make friends is by people being forced to spend time with her. She'll complain so much to her friends that Hazel may end up being excluded at school as well. Then, as soon as Piper is old enough to legally move out, she'll be gone and NC. And your sister will come crying to you, complaining about her 'ungrateful' daughter and how much 'better' Hazel is, and wondering why her daughter just cut and run. \n\nThis is the natural course of forcing step siblings to spend time together against their will. Piper will never forget that Hazel came first to her mother and her own feelings, desires, and autonomy was denied constantly to make Hazel feel better. This is such an obvious consequence to this strategy, playing out time and again, that it honestly makes me wonder about the metal aptitude of parents who still try it. \n\nEspecially in this case. It's been *6 years* since these girls became a family, and the more they've been forced together, the more Piper has pulled away. It's obvious to anyone with eyes and so much as a single brain cell that this strategy is doomed to fail. This is the way you destroy blended families, even biological ones for that matter, not make them work.\n\nYou could try talking to your sister or her husband again. I highly doubt sis will listen, but husband might if you haven't tried him before. And let Piper know she always has a safe space with you, whether that's to vent or have a place to stay for a night, or maybe even let her stay with you while she finds her own place in a couple years. It will likely help her a lot knowing her aunt gets it.", "NTA.  Has anyone talked with Hazel about this?  Unless she's clueless, she must realize that Piper doesn't enjoy being forced to hang out with her.  I'd think Piper and her friends wouldn't be particularly nice to her.  In two years, your sister will be asking why Piper doesn't interact much with her family and stays away as much as possible.", "NTA.  \n\nA cat analogy for you:  \n\nIf you get a new cat, you don't take the new cat and the old cat, throw them into a closet and shut the door.  They'll fucking murder each other.\n\nInstead, you pretty much leave them to their own devices.  Worst case scenario, after some time, they accept there's another cat and they civilly avoid each other.  More often than not though, after enough time passes, you'll catch the cats snuggling up to each other.", "NTA. She is oblivious to the reality", "I get the feeling that the sister favors Hazel to her own daughter. Nta.", "NTA but Anna's got to realize that Piper's going to bolt at 18, right? And go low or no contact.", "NTA\n\nI'm a parent and I can't even get my daughters to like each other and they're fully genetically related. You can't force a relationship between two people. Piper might not *still* feel this way if she had just been given space to begin with. Your sister is wrong and they need to stop trying to force it. Piper doesn't have to like Hazel. The only requirement should be that they are civil to each other and no mistreatment.", "NTA. If she doesn't want your input, she should keep it to herself.", "NTA and you should sit your sister down and tell her that forcing her into hanging out with her stepsister is only going to make Piper hate her and everyone else and she won't see her again after she leaves for college.", "NTA.

Piper is being forced to hang out with hazel to the point she can\u2019t even go out with her friends without getting in trouble. \n\nYou said you would punish her for not listening to you but that isn\u2019t why she is being punished but because she didn\u2019t take hazel.", "How was she excluded they are still going to see it as family?", "Piper doesn't care for her stepsister. It's unfortunate but it happens, though it might not have reached that point if her mother had let things develop naturally instead of 'forced family fun' time. Mom has turned Hazel into a burden.", "Your telling me that you would commseriate with teh idiotic punishment that OPs sister did? \n\nSeriously she is forcing her daughter to have a sisterly relationship and its not working. Sitting there and doing what you suggested just is so stupid. \n\nLike are you like this in you personal life cause its pretty stupid standing around and agreeing with idiotic things.", "No, I am not.  I am saying I would have listened, given the responses you found so idiotic, made popcorn, and watched the fall-out. What I would not have done is told another parent how to parent.\n\nDoing what I suggested guarantees she won't lose the relationship with her sister. It doesn't mean she agrees, just that she's vaguely paying attention to what is being said.\n\nYes, I am actually like this in my personal life. I was still speaking to my 2 brothers who have since passed. I am also on speaking terms with the other 6 siblings because I have never once told them how to parent their children, and they have never told me how to parent mine. Yes, we all have different parenting styles, but it's not our place to interfere with each other. Parenting is between the 2 people that made the child.", "So you would be fine with letting your niblings be abused because their parents can \"parent\" how they like? \n\nSeems like a shitty life", "FFS, huge difference between abuse and trying to force 2 kids in the same house to get along. You are seriously grasping at something that isn't there with that one. Just because I can let them get it wrong and have to live with the consequences of their own choices doesn't make for a shitty life. It leads to a lot of humor, so it's quite entertaining for me. Life is all in how you look at it. Waste all your time spouting opinions that others will ignore anyway if you want to. Just seems like a huge waste of time and effort to me.", "So abuse is humour? Im just following your logic about not butting in cause thats what you said not me. parenting is between the two parents that made the kid right? So if they are beating them or abusing them you would laugh it off and watch it happen. \n\nIm literally following your logic here"]}
