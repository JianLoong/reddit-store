Fast forward to 2016, my mother passed away. Her sister/my aunt asked me for the necklace, the day of her funeral. I told her I didn\u2019t know where it was, which was true. I talked to my dad and siblings about it; we all agreed to keep the necklace with the rest of my mom\u2019s things. Which remained untouched for 5 years. My dad suddenly passed 11 months ago. Same thing happened. My aunt asked about the necklace after his service. And I told her I\u2019d look for it. It made my siblings so angry, they didn\u2019t even invite her back to the house. We all went out to eat, just to avoid the aunt coming to my parents house. She asked me about it a few more times, as we cleaned the house out. I told her I hadn\u2019t seen it, and that  many people had gone through her jewelry. Which is true. My cousins and in laws tore through my mom\u2019s things.\nThe truth is, I have it.
