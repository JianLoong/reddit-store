If she wanted to make sure she was celebrating her daughter while piggybacking on your organization skills and your daughter\u2019s party, she should\u2019ve checked her daughter\u2019s calendar better. I am a bit surprised your niece didn\u2019t say anything to her cousin, though.", "NTA.\n\n\"Hey, you're throwing a party! Can I piggyback on it to have my party with you? But you need to change your date for me...\"\n\nYou did this, which was beyond necessary.\n\n\"Oh, uh, I forgot that I can't make the date that I told you to change it to. I know that it's all planned and people are coming, but can you cancel everything since the date I told you was wrong? It would make me feel bad if your party wasn't about my daughter.\"\n\nUh, no.", "NTA, she should take hers and her daughters needs more seriously.", "NTA. It was her own fault and you were already accommodating her by hosting a party for both girls and then making sure to choose a date that supposedly would work. Her reaction reeks of entitlement that she wanted you to do ANYTHING further to accommodate their changing needs, especially when she couldn't be bothered to even find out about the dates of her daughter's travel. At this point she's back to having the responsibility of throwing her own celebration for her daughter, or not, but you did more than enough and she was out of line.", "NTA. SIL is entitled and unrealistic. Ignore her.", "NTA. On a side note, if SIL lost custody, doesn\u2019t know where her daughter will be when, and easily forgets things, it\u2019s time to look into a medical condition or issue", "NTA.\n\nShe should have taken her own needs more seriously. She couldn\u2019t check the dates her daughter was going to be out of the country? That\u2019s ridiculous. Her inability to ascertain simple information is not your failing.", "NTA. SIL and her lack of awareness are the cause of all the conflicts here.", "NTA. 35/60 guest showed up...Yeah probably because the other half of the invite guest were the other persons guest.", "Definitely NTA. Is your SIL always this entitled? She sounds like an irresponsible AH. Anyway, I'm glad your daughter got to enjoy being the star of her own party and I hope your niece is having a great time away from SIL.", "No, you're NTA.\n\nYour SIL doesn't seem to understand how much planning goes into a party like the one you organized. She also seems quite flaky. \n\nI don't think this is a conflict worth permanently falling out over, but demanding an apology is understandable.", "Of course not. If your SIL didn\u2019t bother to have a conversation with her daughter about a party she wanted to mooch off that\u2019s not your fault. I imagine she would have wanted some of your niece\u2019s friends attending so why wasn\u2019t any planning put in?  You did the right thing and had a party for your daughter. It\u2019s her problem if she missed out.", "NTA - we actually just had a similar situation where two parts of the family had graduation parties on the same day and neither was willing to change the date. NAH there but obviously it affected turn-out for the family members who had to choose one or the other. And as you might suspect, one family's party was much better attended - oh well for the other family.", "NTA. She's an entitled ditz.", "It\u2019s weird your niece didn\u2019t tell your daughter ahead of time about being away that weekend. Wonder if her trip was planned at the last minute, with SIL promising a date change\u2026", "NTA for not changing the date but refusing to speak to her until she apologizes seems childish.", ">I refuse to speak to her till I get an apology.\n\nThat seems like overkill.\n\nRescheduling the party because of her bizarrely poor planning was a hugely unreasonable ask, and you're NTA for refusing. But demanding an apology before you speak to her seems unnecessary, unless you're looking for an excuse to avoid her anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
