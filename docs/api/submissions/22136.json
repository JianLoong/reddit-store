If she wanted to make sure she was celebrating her daughter while piggybacking on your organization skills and your daughter\u2019s party, she should\u2019ve checked her daughter\u2019s calendar better. I am a bit surprised your niece didn\u2019t say anything to her cousin, though.", "NTA.\n\n\"Hey, you're throwing a party! Can I piggyback on it to have my party with you? But you need to change your date for me...\"\n\nYou did this, which was beyond necessary.\n\n\"Oh, uh, I forgot that I can't make the date that I told you to change it to. I know that it's all planned and people are coming, but can you cancel everything since the date I told you was wrong? It would make me feel bad if your party wasn't about my daughter.\"\n\nUh, no.", "NTA, she should take hers and her daughters needs more seriously.", "NTA. It was her own fault and you were already accommodating her by hosting a party for both girls and then making sure to choose a date that supposedly would work. Her reaction reeks of entitlement that she wanted you to do ANYTHING further to accommodate their changing needs, especially when she couldn't be bothered to even find out about the dates of her daughter's travel. At this point she's back to having the responsibility of throwing her own celebration for her daughter, or not, but you did more than enough and she was out of line.", "NTA. SIL is entitled and unrealistic. Ignore her.", "NTA. On a side note, if SIL lost custody, doesn\u2019t know where her daughter will be when, and easily forgets things, it\u2019s time to look into a medical condition or issue", "NTA.\n\nShe should have taken her own needs more seriously. She couldn\u2019t check the dates her daughter was going to be out of the country? That\u2019s ridiculous. Her inability to ascertain simple information is not your failing.", "NTA. SIL and her lack of awareness are the cause of all the conflicts here.", "NTA. 35/60 guest showed up...Yeah probably because the other half of the invite guest were the other persons guest.", "Definitely NTA. Is your SIL always this entitled? She sounds like an irresponsible AH. Anyway, I'm glad your daughter got to enjoy being the star of her own party and I hope your niece is having a great time away from SIL.", "No, you're NTA.\n\nYour SIL doesn't seem to understand how much planning goes into a party like the one you organized. She also seems quite flaky. \n\nI don't think this is a conflict worth permanently falling out over, but demanding an apology is understandable.", "Of course not. If your SIL didn\u2019t bother to have a conversation with her daughter about a party she wanted to mooch off that\u2019s not your fault. I imagine she would have wanted some of your niece\u2019s friends attending so why wasn\u2019t any planning put in?  You did the right thing and had a party for your daughter. It\u2019s her problem if she missed out.", "NTA - we actually just had a similar situation where two parts of the family had graduation parties on the same day and neither was willing to change the date. NAH there but obviously it affected turn-out for the family members who had to choose one or the other. And as you might suspect, one family's party was much better attended - oh well for the other family.", "NTA. She's an entitled ditz.", "It\u2019s weird your niece didn\u2019t tell your daughter ahead of time about being away that weekend. Wonder if her trip was planned at the last minute, with SIL promising a date change\u2026", "NTA for not changing the date but refusing to speak to her until she apologizes seems childish.", ">I refuse to speak to her till I get an apology.\n\nThat seems like overkill.\n\nRescheduling the party because of her bizarrely poor planning was a hugely unreasonable ask, and you're NTA for refusing. But demanding an apology before you speak to her seems unnecessary, unless you're looking for an excuse to avoid her anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA.\n\nOut of interest is your husband supportive on this?", "NTA. Why do I have a feeling that even if you did change the date that might not have worked out for SIL either. She sounds very clueless and self centered. I doubt you'll ever get that apology so enjoy your break from her.", "Guess we know why SIL doesn\u2019t have custody.

So many fewer things for her to keep track of.", "NTA and it seems pretty obvious why your SIL doesn\u2019t have custody of her kids\u2026", "Wonder why she does not have custody? She does not even know the dates her child is abroad! NTA but she is", "NTA.\n\nYou have a whole list of things, just here, that your SIL owes you apologies for.  And she did more than this, aimed at your daughter?   Sounds like she's pretty much toxic, entitled, selfish, clueless, --about half the thesaurus' adjectives. \n\nNot talking to her until she gives a real apology seems like wisdom, to protect yourself from her next selfish scheme, and to protect your daughter.", "NTA especially considering your daughter didn't want a joint party to begin with", "NTA, your SIL sounds like a gem...", "NTA she should\u2019ve been more proactive in checking the dates, she\u2019s inconsiderate", "Oh, I thought at least they were friendly enough to talk about a joint party they were supposedly having and enjoying together. Even more not the asshole, then.", "Stand your ground on the apology. That's such a common A H move to just wait and then pretend nothing happened. If she won't admit she was wrong to lash out at you, you don't need her in your life. \nAnd super NTA. I don't think some people realize what a lot of extra work all this caused you.", "So what is your husband's take on the situation?

Sounds like your SIL doesn't think things through.  Glad your party worked out for your daughter.  Don't expect apologies from entitled people.", "NTA. I see why she's not the primary caretaker... She should have confirmed the date. Changing a party 2 weeks before the party is not easy.", "NTA at all! It was super kind of you to agree to share a party and accommodate her custody agreement. It\u2019s insane how she wasn\u2019t even grateful or aware enough to try to meet you half way. I probably wouldn\u2019t be speaking to her either.", "Your SIL seems selfish, entitled, disorganized and irresponsible. No wonder she doesn\u2019t have custody of her kids.

When my daughter graduated family wanted a shared party.   We had five family members graduate the same year.  Nope.  They had there own friend groups from different schools.  They each deserved their own party.  But if we did I know my in laws would have their crap together.", "NTA. Probably one more reason why SIL does not have custody of her children.", "NTA. But here's my free advice: Don't do SIL any more favors. She's a user. People like her are never satisfied, and they never appreciate anything. Just say NO.", "NTA", "> My daughter didn't want to have a joint party to begin with, but did it to be nice.\n\nThis is the only place you venture into AH territory, you should have respected your daughter more and said no from the get-go.", "You all are nice and already earned your crown Jewels in heaven.

You acted like an adult. She acted semi-functional.", "NTA. As others have said, she piggybacked off your party and you very generously planned everything 4 months in advance.

My parents did this for a cousin of mine who I fucking HATE, and it ruined graduation for me. None of the attention was on me, only him, and I had to deal with his casual homophobia and racism and holier than thou Bible thumping nonsense on a day that was supposed to celebrate one of the biggest accomplishments of my life. \n\nI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t end up working out, but I hope you keep your daughter\u2019s feelings in mind more going forward.", "So, she invited 20 people you didn't know? Did she tell them her daughter wouldn't be there? Did she pay anything towards it?", "Everyone should accommodate MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE", "NTA.\n\nThis entire situation is solely the fault of your SIL. She assumed that everyone would bend over backwards to accommodate her and then was offended by reality.", "Let me get this straight, she asked to join in on your daughter graduation party, you spesficly choose a date for Her 4 months in advance, and no where in those 4 months she told her daughter about the party or asked her if she was available on that date? Did she expected her daughter to be available no matter what? I guess she's the kinda person that only care about herself. Including to her daughter. NTA", "SHE should have taken HER needs more seriously. It was kind of you to accommodate her daughter in the first place, sad that it didn't pan out but that's totally on her.", "Agree, I would expect an apology for her rudeness considering she piggy-backed off your party in the first place and it\u2019s her own fault she got the date wrong. NTA.", "The bit that gets me is you did take her needs seriously. She didn't take her own needs seriously until it was too late to change.", "YTA for forcing your kid to share the party with someone she doesn't like. You were fine till this point but you suck for that", "NTA. And I'm glad she doesn't have custody. It's nice her daughter has a consistent and loving parent that takes care of her. And in case that's not clear, I'm not taking about the mother.", "NTA- plans sometimes fall through. It was your sisters fault but even it wasn't it was still unreasonable to ask you to change things at that point.", "NTA... she needs a calendar and for people to stop covering for her", "NTA but the silent treatment isn\u2019t good either.  Remind her she owes you an apology but I don\u2019t see the point of refusing to speak to her until you get it.  She sounds immature because she clearly didn\u2019t make her daughter\u2019s party a priority.  As a mom I wonder how the hell she couldn\u2019t know that?  But point being she\u2019s immature and you\u2019re never going to get an apology out of her.", "Oh yea that's some pretty important context. Definitely NTA if your daughter didn't even want a joint party but did so to be nice.", "Hold it there buddy, you don't know if the mother pressured her daughter to agree or not. She may have made the decision on her own to include her cousin."]}
