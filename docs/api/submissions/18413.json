I'm fine with this as she has some dietary restrictions and I know she does thorough research before adding any place to the list.\n\nLately, when I've been on lunch break at work, I've been going to places on the list and trying them out to see if I'd like them for a date night and so I can figure out if I think my wife would like those places, too.\n\nUnfortunately, my wife is taking this in the wrong way and is getting upset at me and saying I'm choosing to experience new places without her I know she wants to go. I don't see the big deal as we can just go again together. She says it's about going the first time together, not me going without her . That she feels second rate when I choose to eat at a place I know she's been looking forward to trying with me for the first time. I keep trying to explain that me going alone is different and us going together is still special, even if it's no longer my first time there and to be fair, I'm only doing it because I want to make sure it's a place that has good options for her. She says I'm an AH and she's no longer going to share any new restaurants she wants to try with me because I don't care about her wants and feelings.", "created_utc": 1685313771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ude61/aita_for_experiencing_restaurants_without_my_wife/", "score": 712, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you think you need to eat there first to decide if *she* would like it? Isn\u2019t she the one putting them on the list\u2026?", "YTA.  You see how important it is to her and it is such a little thing, why would you take that away from her?\n\nAnd how many opportunities does she get to go to a restaurant without you?  How about you give her a break one night to let her experience a restaurant without you?", "YTA because you\u2019re married to someone who\u2019s explained her reasoning and you just disregard it. How about if you make a list of all the movies or Netflix shows you plan to watch together. Then you find out she watched them all beforehand and you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s surprised at the endings. It\u2019s something akin to that.", "Your wife puts all this effort into researching restaurants for the two of you to experience together, then you go and eat there without her. YTA.\n\nYou can only do something for the first time once; she wants to share that with you, but you apparently don't. Would you go by yourself to see a movie that she's earmarked for a date night?", "YTA. Just go to different restaurants. You now know this hurts her feelings. Why do it?", "YTA. This is the food equivalent of watching your \u201ctogether\u201d TV shows without her. Stop doing that.", "YTA when does she get to try new restaurants on her lunch break? or is she a sahm an stuck with the kids everyday", "Dude, she already put those places on the list. You don\u2019t need to go there in advance to see if she\u2019d like them, she clearly already does. It\u2019s a bucket list, and you\u2019re completing it without her. YTA.", "YTA. Do you also give her a play-by-play in excruciating detail of your lunch visit? Might as well drive the whole nail in.", "YTA.  Stop trying to argue with your wide and get the internet to back you.  YTA for that too.   Take her to a restaurant, watch the kids more, and be a better partner.", "Oh please. This is something your wife wants to do together. Are you incapable of looking things up to see if you would like them as well like your wife does? You're on Reddit you clearly have internet access. YTA", "YTA. In a comment you state on this list are 8-10 restaurants that she researched to ensure she could eat there. You admit you've been to 6 of those because you wanted to try it out. It's never going to be your first time there again. You won't experience that first with her. You idk if you're controlling or want to one up her by being yes this place is so good.  \n\nI am positive these aren't the only ten restaurants in your area. Why you have to try them all before her is beyond me. If I were her I'd start having date night by myself. Especially since in another comment you watch shows she has mentioned while she handles the kids..\n\nYou just seem to like doing everything before her. Or just too lazy to Google search another restaurant.", "INFO - When you go to these restaurants during your lunch break, are you alone?", "It sounds like she has communicated her desires to you quite clearly. And you are ignoring them. YTA\n\nYou also try to justify ignoring her clearly communicated desires by saying you want \u201cfigure out if [you] think [she] would like those places\u201d. She didn\u2019t ask you to do that. YTA", "YTA. This is important to your wife and upsets her, so what joy do you get in doing that? You said you want to try new things, and also that your wife has some dietary restrictions, so why don't you check out restaurants on your own with foods you'd like to try but usually can't due to these dietary restrictions? I'm a kosher Jew with chilli allergies... my husband is also Jewish but doesn't care about kosher requirements, and he can eat just about anything, so it makes sense for him to go to Mexican or Thai restaurants without me. Be creative like that.", "YTA. She built a list of places to try together and you went to them. What don't you understand about that?  She is not stupid - we all know that you can go to restaurants multiple times, but the point of the list was to experience new things **together**. The fact that you are so unbelievable insensitive to that is absurd. Even in the comments, you keep harping \"we can always go again its special the 2nd time cause it's her\". That's not going to save you. \n\nThe point was to go together and have the moment together. You've taken the newness of it away.", "OP, just stop with the justifications in the comments. You watch the shows she says she wants to watch without her, you go to the restaurants she wants to go to. She's asked you to stop. You clearly do not want to stop for some reason, despite the majority saying YTA. Stop antagonizing her", "Do you even like your wife?  YTA, and a deliberately obtuse one.  She\u2019s has communicated to you, rather clearly, what she wants. She doesn\u2019t want, or need, for you to vet the restaurant, first. She -wants- time, with you, to try something new, together. Not you first, together. Your actions scream, \u201cI know better than you, and I don\u2019t trust your decision making skills\u201d.

She wants to spend that rare time alone together with you checking out a new spot, and there's no reason for you to go to these places first. I could see you going to cool places that she wouldn't be able to eat at or places you were more interested in, but she has a list of places she wants to go to with you and I can see her point, as silly as it might sound to some.", "Dude, you\u2019re totally TA. \n\nDate night is about experiencing something new together. She\u2019s not a child, and you\u2019re not *her*, so you don\u2019t get to prejudge what she will and won\u2019t like. \n\nFind your own new restaurants to visit during your lunch break. It seems like you\u2019re letting her do all the legwork for your new experiences.", "Dude. Pretty much every place has the menu online. She\u2019s an adult and doesn\u2019t need you to scope out restaurants for her. YTA", "YTA and your comments make you even more of an AH because it shows that you honestly don't care how your wife feels at all as long as you think you're right.", "YTA  \nYour wife wants to go with you to try a new place, not to have you decide for her if it's a good place. She's very specific. It's about going together for the first time together. Not you going separately, checking it out, and then deciding for her if it's good for her.", "It sounds like you\u2019re specifically picking places to eat of the list she made for date night. Like, you\u2019re literally going into your shared google doc and specifically picking places you know she wants to go with you. Come on man. This was not hard. YTA.", "Yta if it's not a big deal then stop. It's a big deal *to her* and you don't care, so stop doing it.", "God you\u2019re a real jerk. I feel so bad for your wife being trapped with an asshole like you who completely devalues the labor she\u2019s trying to put in to keep your relationship alive. Stop being so selfish.", "YTA.... just YTA dude. If its upsetting her then its obviously not a  great idea.", "YTA. So your wife is doing all of the work of finding new places but gets none of the rewards because you are going without her. It\u2019s clear you don\u2019t give a fuck about her because it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve don\u2019t this repeatedly knowing it upsets her and your answer is to shrug and keep doing it. She deserves better. \n\nI hope she finds a bunch of shitty restaurants and puts them on the list and you go without her and have a miserable time.", "YTA. Did it ever cross your mind, that enjoying new experiences together is your wife\u2019s love language? It\u2019s not just about the restaurants, it\u2019s about the fact that your wife feels that you don\u2019t value the time and effort she puts into scouting out new places for you both to try together for the first time, therefore creating the feeling that you don\u2019t value her.\n\nEdit: Everyone keeps telling why you\u2019re the AH, and all you do is continue to argue. You know at this point, it\u2019s hurtful to your wife, yet you don\u2019t seem to care that it is. Expect a breakdown of your marriage if you can\u2019t correct such a simple, small thing for her. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but it is to her. If you keep going on the way you have been, your wife will continually feel less and less valued by you. And for every way she doesn\u2019t feel loved and cared for by you, trust me someone out there can and will make her feel that way.", "Info: do you often have trouble with empathy?", "YTA twice over. I hope your wife starts a new list full of crap restaurants to keep you busy, and that she goes out to the cool restaurants with people who actually care about her.", "Ok OP, I read every single one of your responses and can say, with absolute certainty, YTA. Your wife has clearly communicated to you that you going to these specific 8-10 restaurants without her hurts her and you have stated, with apparent glee in some cases, that you went because they looked interesting and you were too lazy to do your own research, which you also do with TV shows that she would like to watch with you. You have told her three things with these actions:\n1. You do not care about her feelings as she has asked you stop and you not only have actively refused, you had to ask the internet if you were wrong, thereby discounting HER telling you already that YTA. You also have told her that your date nights together are not as important to you as they are to her because you are taking the experience of first away. Yes, it is her first time, but she is telling you that she still wants to have \"firsts\" with you, like when you were dating, before she was a mom. She wants the romance and the excitement and you are taking that away. \n2. That you ultimately cannot be trusted to not use the information she gives you against her. She told you her interest and you did it without her, knowing that she now won't want to do it. This is why she will stop sharing with you, her interests and ideas, because she cannot trust you. \n3. That you are lazy and are unwilling to do the emotional and mental labour needed to make a successful relationship. You took her research, rather than do your own, even though she has asked you to stop. This tells her that the success on the relationship, the success of the family will rest on her and she is not to rely on you to bring anything more to the table, that you are done growing. You have told her that you are not her partner, but just another person to take care of. \nDid you mean to say all that, byignoring her requests, probably not, but that's what you said to her. I suspect that she will start closing down and only talk about the kids soon, effectively ending the conversation between the two of you.", "These are particular restaurants that she picked that fit her dietary restrictions. You are using her list to spice up your lunch. YTA", "YTA.\n\nLook at it from her perspective. She is a SAHM who freelances. She doesn't have the time or freedom to just try new things individually so when she does have a spare moment, she spends time researching new places that she could experience with you on date night. This means to her, date nights are extra special because she gets to try something new with someone she loves.\n\nSo when you flippantly decide to have lunch at these places she's earmarked for your special time together, she sees you as flaunting your freedom to try new things and making her special date night less special because you've already had the experience. If I see a movie by myself, I'm going to be less invested in it when my husband and I watch it together. It's the same thing with the restaurant. She wants you both to be in awe of the tiki bar together, but you are taking that feeling away because you've already experienced it.\n\nAnd what's more, she communicated quite clearly that she wants to go with you to these places. And you are ignoring her wishes. Do you know how often the SAHM's wishes get ignored? Often. So stop. This is one very minor thing you can do to make her happy.", "YTA", "Maybe you should be going home for lunch or waiting to share the opportunity. Does she have uninterrupted breaks to try new restaurants on her own? If not, YTA", "YTA \n\nIt makes her feel unimportant and devalued, maybe stop seeking validation on the internet, apologise and stop doing it.", "My boyfriend once played a game and watched a couple of movies I had mentioned being interested in, arguing that he would still play/watch with me. I explained it was not the same once he had already experienced them without me. So, do you know what he did? Stopped doing that. And do you know why? Because he is a good boyfriend who cares about my feelings.\n\nYTA", "YTA - you're doing an activity your wife wants to do together by yourself. Then you're going home and telling her whether she'd like it or not. \n\nShe already told you she wants to go. She doesn't need you to tell her what she wants, she already decided!", "YTA it matters to her. Also, I\u2019d be pissed that you get to lunch out so much. Does she?", "INFO:\n\nIs your wife a SAHM?\n\nIs she home all day long with the kids? \n\nSo she has dietary restrictions and does research on it. \n\nWHY do you find joy in ruining something that brings her joy? It sounds like this is the main thing you gain from doing this. Getting to go home, and laugh at her and make her upset, sort of like punishing her for staying home with the kids while you c an freely roam for lunch.\n\nSHE MAKES THE LIST of places. You don't do squat to help her. You just stomp over it and make her unhappy.\n\nIt sounds like you genuinely don't like this woman, and you need to impart some misery to her day in order to feel good. Where is it coming from?  Are you resentful of something? Angry with her? Want her to feel badly and you like making her upset? \n\nDo you like knowing that each time you do this, you remind her \"of her place\"? That's she's just a mother and not worth experiencing this joy?", "YTA - soft at first but after reading your comments more and moreso because you keep saying it\u2019s different if you go together. NOT FOR HER. She wants to see YOUR first experience with the food and vibes as well, not be shown around by you on your high horse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to compromise and just say okay we\u2019ll go together. It\u2019s not like a list of 100 but just 8-10 - which seems pretty reasonable.", "YTA I feel sad for your wife.", "Yeah, you\u2019re kinda being the a** - if anything, why not scope out places she hasn\u2019t found yet? It\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re wanting to \u201cget ahead\u201d of her or something- is it that big of a deal to wait and try it together?", "YTA. You can argue til you're blue in the face that it shouldn't effect her dining experience if you go there alone first, but you're wrong, because SHE IS TELLING YOU NOT TO DO IT. It doesn't matter what your thoughts are, she is telling you that something you are doing is upsetting her and you KEEP ON DOING IT. You are selfish, full stop.", "YTA.\n\nYour reasoning sounds like the garbage my ex used to spew.", "I get what you're saying, but YTA. This is clearly important to her (and she explained very well why!), how hard is it to just wait for her? And I hate your excuse. You need to see if it would be a good place for her even though by your own admittance she does very thorough research beforehand? I call bullshit, and I don't blame her for keeping you in the dark moving forward. It shouldn't even be a big deal but you had to make it one by making a whole post about it, instead of just waiting until you could go together.", "YTA - You're deliberately going out of your way to do something your wife has expressly told you she doesn't like. Doubly so when you add in watching shows she wants to see without her. Seems like you lack basic respect for your wife's feelings. She's right to be upset at you.", "YTA.\n\nIt changes the dynamic completely.\n\nShe wants you to experience it together, as equals.\n\nBut now, you've already been. You're the expert. You know what's going on. She's the new one. She doesn't know what to expect. \n\nIt's no longer a shared experience of newness together. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis feels like a power move.", "YTA-your comments you keep adding make you more and more of an AH. I\u2019m to the point where I\u2019m shocked you got this woman to marry you in the first place!", "YTA\n\nWould you go and see a movie without her, to see if she'd like it?\n\nDon't do it with restaurants either. It's the experience of going there for the first time together. You're robbing her of that.\n\nTake of your logical hat and put on your husband hat.", "YTA...and your post is fake", "Hmm, is this a control or anxiety thing? If it bothers her that you go without her first, why not just allow it to be a surprise for you both? Are you comfortable going to a place for the first time together?", "She wants to go to the restaurants for the first time WITH YOU, as a mutual, shared, experience. Are you really this dense, or just utterly self-absorbed? And your comments just make it even worse, btw. YTA", "YTA do you even like your wife!.", "You are deliberately hurting your wife and don't care. When Reddit says YTA , you argue about it. Are you deliberately obtuse? Doubt it. You just give zero fucks about the feelings of the woman who is at home raising your children. In about 7 years, when she finally has enough and walks away, you will be back here telling us \"I don't understand, it came out of nowhere! All I did was leave a dish by the sink! Next the receipt for that new sushi place I went to without her!\" (See link referenced above by another Redditor) \n\nDon't say we didn't warn you.", "Do you even like your wife?\n\nYTA", "YTA. Never do this. Maybe it's the 18 years experience I have, but she clearly wants to do this TOGETHER. Not \"oh yeah, that place you wanted to try? It's good.\"", "YTA do you, like, hear your wife's requests and say to yourself, excellent, another chance to make her feel second rate. Is it because you know she can do better then you?", "YTA  It wasn't about the restaurant for your wife, it was to have a special experience with the man she cared about. You didn't go for her, if you had she would have been with you. But you preferred to have the experience on your own, showing her you care more about yourself than her. That anything she wants will always come second to your own. You care more about yourself than you do your wife. She should start leaving you at home with the kids and going out to these restaurants on her own because you obviously don't want to go with her.", "YTA. No need for explanation because literally everyone here collectively agrees and explained why", "YTA\n\nAnd from your comments, I wish a thousand years of food poisoning on you.", "If my husband did this to me, it would lead me to be less interested in planning date night and likely lead to not even wanting date night.  YTA.  You're alienating your wife and you don't even seem to care after multiple people have pointed it out.  \n\nShe's starting to resent you and that's a marriage killer.", " YTA  YTA  YTA  YTA  - this would make me FURIOUS. The list is SACRED. If my SO went to places in the list without me they'd be in serious trouble.", "YTA", "YTA 100%", "YTA.\n\nYou say you're only going there for her, to check they have good options for her. That's fine, but she has now explained to you how she feels about that, that it cheapens the shared experience.\n\nSo at this stage if you insist on continuing trying them solo first, you are going to have to admit that it's not being done with the intention of putting your wife first.", "YTA\n\nCan\u2019t you see it\u2019s really not about the food but having the experience of trying new things with you? Not only that she puts the time to research these places and you\u2019ve been \u201cgoing to places in the list\u201d to see if YOU would like them for date night. Your wife has already picked those places, you going ahead to make sure they have options for her is a cop out. You wanted to go for yourself, plain and simple.", "YTA, \n\nYou get to go out to a nice meal that she would want to have but she\u2019s home with the kids, and you think that\u2019s okay? You need to knock this off and also make up for it by making sure she gets some extra days to herself where you stay home with the kids and she goes out to eat or gets a massage or something.", "YTA. Your wife has said she specifically wanted to experience these for the first time with you but you want to go first because she's basically giving you lunch spots to try out on your own. Do you not get a spoonful of guilt with every bite that goes down knowing you're deliberately going against her wishes? Weird.", "Oh, YTA in so many ways...oh, my dude. How do you not get that your long leisurely lunches to check out restaurants prior to taking your wife \"to experience for the first time TOGETHER\" is definitely not okay. I mean, traumatic brain injury? Does your wife get the opportunity to check out half the restaurants FUCKING ALONE before you go together to check them out for the first time? Because until that happens,  you need to just stop. And buy your wife a spa day. Because this is pretty basic stuff. It's hard not to imagine that you are obtuse about other pretty basic stuff. Pack a lunch for a week or two, save the money and spend it on a luxurious spa day for her.", "You have nice intentions but YTA and your wife\u2019s point hits the nail on the head", "YTA, you know the list is FOR BOTH OF YOU to go together. You even acknowledge the fact that she takes time to research places FOR BOTH OF YOU and yet you still choose to go by yourself. \n\nYour wife perfectly explained her feelings and reasoning for being upset and yet you're doubling down on being a jerk.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore you knew that it mattered to her - that she wanted to share the exploration with you and did not want you to prescreen - you weren't doing anything wrong.  But now that you know, it's unfair of you to flout her request.   (Unless it's a special situation like your boss decides to take your department out to one of the places on the list - and in that case, you apologize and let her know that it wasn't your choice.)", "YTA. Here\u2019s an idea. Why don\u2019t you do some fucking work and find your own restaurants that she CAN\u2019T eat at and go there because you\u2019re being ridiculously cruel and callous.", "YTA. I\u2019ve read some of your responses and comments and let me just say you are purposefully upsetting your wife. And you dang well know it. She\u2019s asked you not to go to restaurants or watch shows she\u2019s put on a list so you immediately do those things. She is telling you that it upsets her. Watch other shows and go to different restaurants. It\u2019s simple to do those things but you will continue to ignore her feelings because you are being an AH.", "I think she needs to stop sharing the list with you! You are using it to sabotage what she is trying to accomplish.", "YTA- It is not just a resturant. It is an experience she looks forward to trying with you!!!. Nowadays you can look up menus online so there is absolutely no reason to go and check out the menu for her.", "YTA. Date night is a chance for you two to do something together that\u2019s fresh and new. You remove the \u201cshared experience\u201d part of that when you jump ahead and filter her experience. If you\u2019re that fortunate to have other restaurant options that are not on her list, go to those places and save the list for date night. You screwed up and owe her an apology.", "YTA you purposefully choose the restaurants you know she wants to go to with you, but cannot because she is at home taking care of your eight year and 6 month old children. she has explained why what you are doing hurts her and you do not care to change your behavior. you know it is something that is special to her, but you continue to go against her wishes.", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to care about your wife or her feelings. You sound like the kind of person who purposely spoils the ending of movies.", "Kind of yes. Maybe she is also reacting a little bit to much but I can understand it. The whole thing is about trying something new TOGETHER. That is the fun part. If one of them has already tried the restaurant the exciting part is gone.", "YTA. Look at all these comments, dude. Grown some impulse control and stop going to places your wife wants to go with you for the first time. Stop being lazy and find other places to eat that aren't in your list. Put some effort into your relationship and take the mother of your children out to dinner.\n\nYou are hurting your marriage with you inconsiderate thoughtlessness. Do you get it? You are jeopardizing your relationship because you're lazy and inconsiderate.", "YTA. If I tell my husband I want to go to someplace new together and he decided to go there alone before we did, I'd be very hurt. I want that first time going to a new place to be that special sort of date, and it won't feel like that knowing that he's gone there first without me. I'd feel a bit different it was something with his parents, because while that would suck, I know he'd likely didn't have a choice. But to willingly go by himself? Nope, that'd be painful for me.  \n\n\nYou're taking the joy from your wife by going alone, and on top of that, you're not trusting her to figure out if she wants to go to a place based off of her dietary restrictions. By checking out the place yourself and then trying to act like it's \"helping\" when it's not, you're disrespecting her and her hard work in vetting the place. And now she's telling you how she's feeling, and you're still trying to find a way to disrespect and minimize her feelings so you can feel like you're \"right\". You're not. I don't blame your wife for no longer wanting to share things with you, and I'd honestly be surprised if she says she doesn't want to do date nights anymore if all she's going to feel like is a second fiddle. Stop going to the places she wants to go to together until after you go for the first time, and listen to your wife when she says you're hurting her and apologize to her right away. Don't listen to your ego and double-down.", "Oh, but see, this can come across as a control issue and about not being at the same level when trying out something. Knowledge is power. She wants to go on a discovery **with** you. That's some of the fun. But then you've been there already, and suddenly you're the expert and the one in the driver's seat. She's just the passenger.\n\nWhat if there was a TV series you had agreed to watch together, but she had started watching it on her own and argued that it didn't matter because \"it's different when we're watching it together\"? NO!

We try to get in a monthly date night without the kids. Sometimes my wife will find a restaurant she'd like to try and put it on our list of places to check out. I'm fine with this as she has some dietary restrictions and I know she does thorough research before adding any place to the list.\n\nLately, when I've been on lunch break at work, I've been going to places on the list and trying them out to see if I'd like them for a date night and so I can figure out if I think my wife would like those places, too.\n\nUnfortunately, my wife is taking this in the wrong way and is getting upset at me and saying I'm choosing to experience new places without her I know she wants to go. I don't see the big deal as we can just go again together. She says it's about going the first time together, not me going without her . That she feels second rate when I choose to eat at a place I know she's been looking forward to trying with me for the first time. I keep trying to explain that me going alone is different and us going together is still special, even if it's no longer my first time there and to be fair, I'm only doing it because I want to make sure it's a place that has good options for her. She says I'm an AH and she's no longer going to share any new restaurants she wants to try with me because I don't care about her wants and feelings.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Perfectionist tendencies, details oriented etc.  This can be a great thing but you are letting your desire for perfection get in the way of your relationship goals.  Refocus dude!

But there are certain places Ive told him 'Do not go here without me' and he knows. Its not hard to listen.", "YTA. It's obvious. Thing is, if you both experience a place for the first time, you're communicating and meshing your feelings together about the place. The sights, smells, tastes... You can love the place. You can hate the place. It's still an experience you'll have in common with her. It could strengthen your bond just because you both agree that the food was mediocre and the waiter forgot your drinks three times. You can both complain about it and laugh along later.\n\nShe wants that connection with you and you're wasting it on clients and the need to check out a place because it sounds cool. If you don't understand this, then maybe you never will. Taking care of kids is hard and doesn't end at bedtime.

It\u2019s honestly that simple not to be the AH here.", "YTA, but you already knew that.

You are taking away that opportunity by going ahead of time. \n\nAlso, why do you feel the need to scout it first when you yourself say you KNOW she researched thoroughly?

Well, every time you glibly cast her feelings aside, you just lose a part of her trust in you and your marriage. I\u2019ve been married over 28 years. Early in our marriage, my hubby expressed what I thought where \u201clittle things\u201d and I didn\u2019t pay attention. Guess what?

You experiencing it alone ahead of time changes the dynamics of date night and you're no longer \"in it together\". Stop going to these places without her if you want to fix this. It's pretty simple and you can make different choices, this is not her asking too much of you.", "yta.  It's like watching a show when you know she wants to watch it with you.  Yeah.... you can watch it again... but the mystery is gone.  Why is your wife handling bedtime with kids with different ages... while you watch netflix?", "YTA. I bet your wife would like a lunch out too. Why not go home and look after the children snd let her go and check it out?  Or better still do as she has asked and explore together - why can\u2019t you accept her wishes- you are making her feel invalidated.", "YTA - she does all this work researching and finding new places to try with you just for you to go off alone and enjoy them first. Go with her for the first time. If you like it then go back for lunch on your own.", "YTA\n\nBut seriously everyone. He\u2019s just saying crap to annoy us all.

Because it is a really big thing to her, and you are choosing to disrespect her wishes. \n\nThis is rather like when a man has an affair and says, \"But it meant nothing\". This is the ultimate insult. If it mean nothing, why would he risk everything? Why would a man choose to hurt his wife over nothing?", "YTA and a big one! Apart from the fact it for you to go together... on a date! You are essentially treating yourself while your wife gets nothing and rubbing it in that you are doing it at places she wants to go. Honestly that would be a therapy before divorce reason for me how selfish you are.", "YTA. That\u2019s not why you\u2019re doing it. Don\u2019t gaslight us and her. It\u2019s to have a lil treat.

A spouse is more important.", "YTA, my husband does this, but with anime I want to watch. She picked the restaurant out, she saw online/through research that she can/wants to eat there, as you said, and then you go and eat there without her. She wants to experience the restaurant for the first time with you, but because you go there first, it takes away that \"we are experiencing this together\" feeling. It cannot be difficult to eat elsewhere and wait for your wife, especially knowing she is dying to try it.", "That's like agreeing to watch a show together and watching episodes without her. Yta", "YTA. You said she does thoroughly research before adding a restaurant to the list; why would you need to test out the restaurant to see if she'd like it when she's already done the research and decided it's something she would like?

There'd be people find with you doing this, and people who aren't. Now that you know your wife *doesn't* like you doing this, you stop, obviously.\n\nWhat you don't do is persist, and explain your reasons for doing it.

Maybe if you ate out less for lunch you could afford to go on a date more than once a month.  My husband would never regularly eat out without me let alone eat out at restaurants I was looking forward to going to for dinner.

Just don\u2019t go to those places first", "Don't marry or be in a relationship with someone if caring about their feelings is too much work.", "Answer: don't get married if you have to ask if you're supposed to care about other people's feelings.", "If you\u2019re in a rlshp with someone that you want to keep and u want to keep it loving and kind, then yes u have to care about their feelings \u2026 especially if their request is for u to do/not do something relatively easy and benign, but will have a big impact on them feeling heard and cared for", "Yes bc it's not really about the restaurant, it's about doing things together and experiencing it together. If it hurts someone you love yes you should care.", "Its soooo passive aggressive. He KNOWS exactly what he's doing and rationalizes that he's checking it out for HER...like it's a favor... how many of these places did HE suggest for this list? Did he check em out and make sure they're ok?  No? Only hers? Mind f*ckery. That's what it is. \ud83d\udea9", "He seems to think that it's OK to let his wife do all the hard work by researching restaurants yet give nothing back. I have multiple dietary requirements and even I can find places to eat (even when travelling) fairly easily. He is having his cake and eating it here.", "You keep saying the same thing. People keep telling you YTA and what you're doing is deliberately hurtful to your wife. Accept the judgement you asked for. Think about something from her pov for five minutes. Jeez! It's not like you don't understand what she wants. You just don't think that what she wants counts for anything. That's horrible of you. Y! T! A!", "The way I see it, you\u2019re telling her your experiences (singular) take priority over experiences as a couple. Even if it seems like a dumb concern in your eyes , it\u2019s a selfish gesture to continue going against her wishes because you can\u2019t wait a few extra days to try it with her. I suspect it\u2019s less about the actual action and more about the selfish intentions behind it. As a SAHM,  she has probably does not have the same freedom in her day to put a self-serving decision over a kid or family centered one. That\u2019s why date nights might feel more important to her than to you.", "How she feels does not appear to matter to you. For this reason alone I am giving you a YTA. You have ways you think she SHOULD feel and do not take into account her actual feelings.", "I hope she goes with someone else because she deserves better then you", "You sincerely can't be missing this much emotional intelligence... Do you really believe what you're saying?? Either way, you know it hurts your wife, yet you don't care and continue the same behavior. Don't be surprised when she stops feeling the same for you. You blatantly disregard her feelings. She won't be able to keep caring for yours forever when it's so one-sided. YTA, in case you were still confused.", "We know how you feel\u2026 now pay Attention to how she feels! Yta", "It hurts you zero to wait to experience the restaurants your wife does all the research for because you can't be bothered for the first time together. Your wife has told you and been very clear that it hurts and ruins the whole point of it for her to do the research you don't want to do to have fun date nights you guys can experience for the first time together. Unfortunately for your wife, you also give zero shits about how she feels because it inconveniences your lunches.", ">but I don't feel like I took it away since we can both still go together\n\nShe feels different, and you simply don't care.  YTA.\n\nYour poor wife.  You don't listen to her, and you're clearly not listening to the 300+ people thus far who are trying to explain this to you.", "[removed]", "Reddit, where someone who admittedly can\u2019t maintain friendships let alone relationships gives relationship advice.", "Yep. Typical redditor jumping to conclusions with one piece of information thinking they have intimate knowledge about the entire relationship.", "Then I'm sorry to say you both picked bad partners.", "What if they didn't make that vow? Lots of people write their own, you know.", "It\u2019s one thing to have experienced somewhere before under different circumstances, but the restaurant list is the WIFE\u2019S list that she found that met her dietary needs that they could experience ON DATE NIGHT! He didn\u2019t happen to go there for work one time. \n\nThen when she explained her side he disregarded her feelings that she shouldn\u2019t be having them. Really?! He gets to dictate her feelings?!\n\nLike others have said\u2026no way is this an isolated issue. \n\nNeeds to pull his head out of his butt!", "Sounds exhausting. I think I'll enjoy being single, then. Going to whichever restaurant I want, whenever I want.\n\nNeither waiting for someone to take me, or having to wait for someone to go with me. \n\nPeople should be aware of the benefits of single life- and that it's a legit option. Not just something that happens to people.", "OP doesn\u2019t love his wife. OP only loves himself. OP is YTA", "It's worse than that. He likes hurting her and cruelty is the whole point of what he's doing. It has nothing to do with restaurants or tv shows, the point is that she values those things so he will destroy her ability to enjoy them. \n\nYou can tell the difference between the people honestly asking us for advice and passive aggressive sadists who experience a thrill when they inflict cruelty on the people who love them. *They're only here to get off on hearing us tell them how awful they were. It makes them giggle.*\n\nThey do it for the same reason people troll and prank others, but this is more sinister because their victims *love and trust* them. They're going \"haha you unsuspecting sucker, I totally got you and I will keep getting you until there's nothing left of you or the things you care about.\"", "Yeah, I'm not sure why people disagree, I really hope this the majority don't think this is a healthy way of thinking.", "Yeah you seem really sorry", "he\u2019s definitely not a bad partner. he does 100% of the childcare when he gets home from work, cooks dinner every night & does the grocery shopping, does all the dishes & 95% of the laundry, and is loving & involved with our child, booked me a solo trip to visit my best friend out of state for Mother\u2019s Day. it\u2019s just a product of the situation, all of my SAHM friends feel it too. they can never understand what it\u2019s like to not have the freedom they do because they don\u2019t understand it\u2019s a freedom. it\u2019s frustrating that he can leave work on a lunch break to get a hair cut, but I can\u2019t even go to a doctor appointment solo. has nothing to do with his character. and for me it\u2019s exasperated by a completely inflexible job (military), so even when he wishes he could help he often can\u2019t. the burn out is real. having a child completely changed your relationship dynamic & it requires a lot of communication to work thru issues like this.", "Great, please don't inflict yourself on anyone.", "I\u2019ve always loved being single as well. But even single people care about other\u2019s feelings \u2026 unless you also have no friends or rlshps with other people at all. \n\nI\u2019m not single anymore, but I still go to restaurants alone, travel alone, and do all of the things I enjoyed as a single person. But sometimes I do those things with my partner too. Or with my friends. And sometimes I do them solo. I don\u2019t wait for someone to take me to a place I want to see or wait till they\u2019re available if I wanna go \u2026 unless it was something  like this, where the place wasn\u2019t even on my radar until my partner told me about it and they let me know they wanted me to go together.\n\nETA: It\u2019s good you\u2019d like to remain single though since I agree, your views about others feelings don\u2019t seem conducive to a good rlshp. Good for u having the self awareness to realize that instead of making some poor person miserable like what OP is doing.", "I don\u2019t think getting in a relationship is going to be an issue", "I totally agree. It makes me wonder what else is going on in their relationship, and what other enjoyments she has, which he seeks to control and ruin. Does he tell her what to wear? Who to hang out with? Does she want to experience things with him so much because she has nobody else to enjoy these things with and has a case of Stockholm Syndrome? I wish that there was a way to see if OP's wife is OK, because I am genuinely concerned about her.", "Yeah lol. I don't really have any friends. I have family, but even being around them too long annoys me. I guess I've spent too much time alone. I've forgotten how to be around others. Even before Covid.\n\nAlso, lately, I think I'm losing empathy for others. That may just be a bipolar thing though. Idk. Should probably inquire about that.", "I am, too and I'm worried he's probably going to mess with his kid's heads, too. I wish we could talk with her.", "Even if you don\u2019t want to have rlshps with other people I agree investigating a new lack of empathy is worthwhile. Lack of empathy for others can influence how we view / feel about ourselves, and I hope you at least care about your own feelings.", "I'm glad I'm not the only person who saw red flags, to be honest. Makes me feel less... exaggerating.", "They count on good people giving them the benefit of the doubt since good people can't imagine acting like that. It's scary because lot of people who do this seem like really nice people. \n\nEveryone always told me how lucky I was to have such a wonderful mother but they had no idea who she really was, and if I shared individual incidents, they'd say things like oh surely she didn't mean to hurt me and look how well I turned out, she couldn't have been *that* bad. The problem is hard to describe, so it's almost impossible for people like OPs wife to get support.\n\nEta at least she still has enough self regard to tell him he's an AH. I hope she listens to her gut and gets away"]}
