First my brother did about 2 years ago. I first heard from my mom that it was because I made a political comment he took offense to, then later she said it was because he didn\u2019t like how I treated her. I tried to reach out to him but never received a response. So, about a year ago I stopped trying though I do still send holiday and birthday cards to try to make it clear the door is open.\n\nMy sister has stopped talking to me over the past 6 months. She said it was because I don\u2019t treat my mom well (her words were \u201cOnce you have an acceptable relationship with mom, I will consider having a relationship with you\u201d). She would not elaborate or give specifics. I do not know what \u201cacceptable\u201d is. She has since not responded to any attempts at communication. My mom has since told me that both my siblings have a list of things I\u2019ve done wrong stemming from after my son was born about 8 years ago (I had postpartum depression and \u201ccried too much\u201d) up until this past spring when I apparently made a reference to \u201cyou people\u201d when I was visiting there very rural, very conservative community (which, admittedly, is not my favorite place). My mom said they don\u2019t want to interact with me because of these things. \n\nHere\u2019s my issue with it - they never told me anything bothered them. I never had a chance to explain a miscommunication, take back a bad choice of words, or change a behavior. If I had any idea my actions were so terrible it was worth throwing away our relationships, I would have tried to discuss it, avoid certain topics, or change my behavior. But I was given no opportunity to do so. I certainly do have a very tense relationship with my mom, but it\u2019s a two-way street. I\u2019ve been in counseling for years because of this and have worked hard on trying to make it better, but it\u2019s very challenging when only one person is engaged in the fixing. My mom recognizes we have a tough relationship, she doesn\u2019t think she needs counseling because \u201cnothing is wrong with her.\u201d wEe do talk about our relationship, the arguments we have, and try to get along. She said I\u2019ve never done anything remotely close to making her want me out of her life and she doesn\u2019t understand my siblings. If it\u2019s relevant I live far away from them and only see them about 2-3 times per years. We have children and I\u2019d especially like to keep relationships civil especially because of them (I want to know my nieces and nephews, want my children to know their aunts and uncles, and the cousins adore each other).
