I'm the breadwinner while he is the primary care giver for our daughter. Our schedules work for the most part but I really need more time to decompress. I'm a lawyer while my husband works in academic research. Our days start by me getting up around 7 to get breakfast ready and my daughter would wake up around 7:30. I will feed her and then go take a bath together. My husband would be up by 8:30am and he will be dressed and ready by 9 as I leave. I try to finish work till 5-6 but end up usually finishing by 7:30-8pm on good days. \n\nDuring this time, my husband cleans up the house, makes lunch and dinner, drops of lunch for me and runs his errands for the house. He also plays and takes care of our daughter while also teaching her both our native languages. He will get some of his work for his job that he can do remotely done when she takes her naps. He will leave for work around 6:30, his work is walking distance from our place while mine is a drive away. Since, I'm often not able to make it home, our daughter will be with either his mother, my sister or our neighbor who also has a 2-year-old. This puts additional pressure on my plate to get home quicker to relieve these people from this additional duty. My work already required me to work twice as hard as most of my counterparts because this is such a high-pressure job with a lot of internalized sexism. I had cut my maternity leave short and come back early because my coworkers warned me about how people were eying my clients and position. Just to prove myself, I had to work even harder. \n\nWhen I get home, I'm burnt out. I don't get any time to decompress really as I have to take care of my daughter as soon as I get back until her bedtime at 9. I'd then finish whatever little work I can which I had to abandon to get home in time. By 10 I'm spent and just crash in my bed and maybe get an hour to myself until I fall asleep. My husband will come back around 12-12:30am and fall asleep. \n\nThis was working but I'm spent. I can't do this anymore. If my husband quits his job, I won't have the extra pressure to rush home nor would I have to wake up early and take care of our daughter right away. I'd also be able to get at least some time to myself. His job doesn't really pay as much and mostly covers his personal expenses and a few bills which my salary can easily cover. I pay for most of the stuff here and it's important that I am able to work at my best for that salary\n\nI had a conversation with him where he was very defensive and didn't want to quit as its fulfilling and has been his dream for a long time despite it not being practical at this point in life and well out of frustration, I called his job a hobby since it doesn't pay much and doesn't really contribute to the household. I know it was harsh but at the end of the day it is the truth. He's not been his cheery self for a few days now and is barely talking to me.

Aside from running the experiments and doing other types of research activities, it also involves things like teaching classes, mentoring more advanced students, writing papers and giving presentations at professional conferences to share the things you've learned in your research, and much more.\n\nIf you're getting paid to do something, it is a real job.  Even if it doesn't pay as much as being a lawyer.  \n\nPublic school teachers aren't paid much, but it is a real job. The janitor who cleans your law office isn't paid much, but it is a real job. If your firm has a secretary or receptionist, they aren't paid much, but it is a real job.  When your daughter is ready for daycare or preschool, the people who take care of her and teach her won't be paid much, but it is a real job.\n\nYour husband is putting in a full day's work of childcare and housecleaning, and then turning around and doing another full day's work of academic research, something that requires one to be at the top of their game in terms of focus, intellect, and creativity.\n\nIf your job is supposed to end at 6:00, and you are routinely staying until 7:30 or 8:00, you have poor time management skills. \n\nAnd if your agreement with your husband is that you will come home and take over childcare when he has to go to work, and you are instead staying at work that late, you are betraying his trust and your word to him.\n\nYou don't say what type of research he does.  But universities and colleges do not pay people for their hobbies. The government and various foundations do not give out grants just to fund people's hobbies.  Whatever his field, the things that he discovers in his research help us better understand and interact with the world. \n\nThe computer you use for your work, the online databases that make your research into the law regarding a case, the carpet on the floor of your office, all exist because people were doing basic research that laid the foundation that allowed these things to be developed.", "YTA, if your salary can pay for so much more hire some help. Can your husband change his hours to work during the day and you guys pay for daycare? Working outside the home is important to some people. His work sounds important to him", "YTA - the fact that you make more money is irrelevant here - it sounds like your husband definitely contributes fairly to housework and childcare - academic research is an important field and NOT a hobby - you\u2019re a massive asshole for belittling his job like that. If you make good money, why not hire a nanny who can relieve the pressure you feel to rush home? You need to check yourself and apologize to your husband for trivializing his career.", "YTA. This is so rude and dismissive. You're husband isn't to blame for your inability to put boundaries in place with your work. If you should leave by 6 leave by 6. If you can't  ever leave by 6 then hire a nanny for the regular hours you guys need, or have a conversation with your neighbour/family who are currently filling the gap about having a more concrete arrangement so you don't feel you' re putting them out. \n\nYou could have talked to your husband or your work or your friends and family about options, dictating how you want him to live his life around your schedule is AH behaviour.", "YTA. You\u2019re making this out to be about his job when in reality, it\u2019s your job that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s a pressure cooker that made you cut your maternity leave short and you get home when most people have already eaten and are watching Jeopardy. Yes, yours pays more, but it\u2019s your job that\u2019s wreaking havoc in your life. If your husband is getting paid for what he does. It is not a hobby. It\u2019s only a hobby if he is self-employed and is running in the red from year to year. Also, when you had a child, this is what you signed up for. Without that time with her, the two you aren\u2019t bonding as mother and daughter. Are you proposing that your husband now spend every waking hour with her while you work all day, come home, and then crash on the couch? A few weeks of that and just wait and see how you feel when she prefers daddy over you in everything. It will only build animosity between you and your husband and daughter. Be a good lawyer and instead of going to trial, try to reach a settlement. Instead of \u201ceither/or\u201d thinking, think \u201cand.\u201d How can both of us do our jobs? Have you thought about finding another job that isn\u2019t quite so demanding? Have you thought of every possible solution where you and your husband can work this thing out? In the end, what you did was elevate your work above his and that\u2019s pretty crappy.

Ummmm. Why did you have a kid?\n\nHe loves his job. So he keeps his job! \n\nYou need to find work, life, balance better. Not stay at work 500 hours and worry about working more to prove yourself. Basically you had a baby, work like you had a baby, don\u2019t cut your maternity leave short to stop your colleagues taking your job! Personally I\u2019d say look for a better and more fulfilling job in a more supportive workplace. Don\u2019t ask your husband to give up his work to support your toxic work environment", "YTA. You can't expect him to be \"cheery\" after you insulted his work just because he doesn't make as much money as you.

So you spend less than 2 hours per day with your child and you want your husband to quit his job so you can parent less. Got it. Again, YTA.\n\nYou're the one who chose to dedicate your life to your firm instead of your family, don't expect to drag your husband down with you.", "YTA, honestly it sounds like your husband is carrying most of the workload at home. While you seemed to have actively put yourself in burnout by going out of your way for work. I understand that you\u2019re the breadwinner but that means nothing when your husband is pulling more than his fair share of the weight when it comes to your child and home.", "YTA for calling his job a hobby and telling him to give it up. Would it be possible to hire a sitter or nanny? There are other ways to get the help you need besides forcing him to quit something he's passionate about", "YTA - if the roles were reversed and he was the breadwinner, saying your job is nothing but a hobby and asked you to quit, how would that make you feel? You'd probably think he was sexist, selfish and being oblivious to your feelings and selfworth.\n\nHave an actual conversation with him, try and find a solution that can work for both of you.", "YTA. \n\nYou want him to quit your job *so you can dump more child care on him so you can work more*.", "YTA. \nWhile i can sympathize with having to prove yourself as a woman and the added stress it gives, it does not give you the right to act the way you are acting. Telling him his job is basically \u201cmeaningless\u201d and telling him he should quit is extremely selfish. How would you feel if sometime told you to quit your career because it wasn\u2019t a \u201creal job\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m very interested in seeing what his job is, to see what you classify as a \u201creal job\u201d.", "YTA\n\nWhat if your husband says you should quit because it stresses you out and you are not helping him out with childcare?", "YTA\n\nyouve shown yourself to be money focused and dismissive of something highly meaningful in the eyes of your loved one. no point in apologizing because you say 'it is the truth'...gee.\n\nthe guy probably has some serious doubts about you as a human. I dont think he is just hurt by your hurtful behaviour. I reckon he is wondering if his efforts (family, kid, 'hobby') are even worth it for spending a life with someone like you:/", "YTA. His \u201chobby\u201d is likely keeping him sane. I\u2019m not reading here that he has any more downtime than you, and he\u2019s clearly pulling his weight in terms of the household. \n\nYou\u2019re in a stage of parenthood that is absolutely brutal. I honestly don\u2019t really remember much from those years (I\u2019m also a breadwinner and mother) - it\u2019s just a blur with some photos to remind me of what I did. It will get better for you both, but right now you both deserve to have what you need to get through it. \n\nHire someone to watch her if that\u2019s within your budget so you both have some breathing room. Survival itself is an okay goal for the time being.", "YTA and demeaning. You know you can find another job that allows you to have a work life balance. Your husband's job isn't a hobby. Maybe it's time for you to get off your high horse and hire a nanny.", "You're a massive AH and I'll echo those who've suggested you spend of that money on help.", "YTA. You showed utter contempt for his job by calling it a hobby. You get paid more but that doesn\u2019t mean your job is somehow superior to his academic research. As for him quitting, I certainly wouldn\u2019t if I were in his shoes. You don\u2019t just leave academia and then easily return to it. Plus why should put himself in a position where he\u2019s completely dependent on you financially.\n\nI understand why you can\u2019t maintain your current pace but perhaps you should consider a different job with not as many demands.", "YTA. There are so many issues you face as a direct result of choices you make but that you hold other people responsible for. You are being condescending when you tell your husband his job is nothing more than a hobby. What you are suggesting is that your husband should dedicate his life to seeing your needs are met. How about you change your job. There must be other ways to work as a lawyer than the position you currently hold.", "YTA\n\n\nWhy did you have kids if you don't want to be a parent?\n\n\nAlso, it sounds like you have the funds to get a childminder/babysitter until you get home from work.

You would likely work longer hours and lose your relationship with your child and husband.", "YTA\n\nInstead of devaluing your husband and putting down his career choice, put more effort into finding childcare, since you can obviously afford it. I don't see how someone as educated as a lawyer doesn't understand that having him quit his job decreases your household income more-so than hiring a nanny or using a daycare would. If you're uncomfortable with a nanny, then you should 100% be on a waitlist for a daycare.", "YTA. You want to be able to take a break and get out of caring for your daughter but if he quits his job then when would he get a break?

Imagine being upset over a job he loves. He deserves a divorce and someone who will support him.", "be a better parent and partner; be there for your daughter and husband. You\u2019re exhausted? So is he, working and taking care of a kid is no easy feat. Even if he did become a SAHP, it wouldn\u2019t be an excuse for you to slack off on childcare In the evenings.

You have zero right to ask him to give up his dream just so you can decompress. i\u2019m sure that him leaving for work is his way of decompressing from the stresses of watching your child all day, which is a job in and of itself. If you want to decompress, figure out a way to leave work earlier and do some work remotely. you say his mom watches your daughter while he leaves? so why is that such a stressor then for you to get home? figure it out before your marriage fails, because insulting your husband isn\u2019t going to work.", "YTA\n\nClearly you need a reality check if you are dedicating that much time to work and want to increase your workload. \n\nNevermind the fact that you husband is in effect balancing TWO jobs, aka the full time home-maker and his actual job, and you think YOURE the one who's burnt out? \n\nAdults need outside interaction, away from their home and children. Child free time is especially important for him since he's doing the lions share of the work where your home and daughter are concerned. \n\nThe fact you have devalued his job to the point you called it a hobby is ridiculously offensive and you really need to take a step back and stop treating your partner like he is nothing more than a slave to your career and ambitions while telling him at the same time that what he does holds no value.", "YTA.  You completely devalued his career.", "YTA for calling his job a hobby. You are killing yourself at a high-pressure job that keeps you working late and seems to make you miserable.

Just like you say his job isn\u2019t practical, why can\u2019t you change jobs? You demean and degrade your husband by likening his job to a hobby.

But from my perspective that\u2019s more because your workplace is toxic and sucks.

I get that it's a dog eat dog world out there in corporate America but you're the one working 80 hours a week and blaming your husband's job for **your** exhaustion. Your family or your job.

He also plays and takes care of our daughter while also teaching her both our native languages.\"\n\n  \nThat sounds like a huge contribution.

This sounds like a you problem, and you're just feeding into all that misogyny by playing their game.\n\nYour husband's job is important too. It gives him a sense of purpose, contributes to the household income, and he could well be setting the groundwork for a good career. Something has to give - but he doesn't need to sacrifice himself at your alter", "Omg YTA. You're working 10 hours a day, parenting for 2-2.5 and getting an hour to yourself. Your husband is parenting for 7 hours, while working and doing housework, and working for 6 hours outside the home. When is his hour to himself?\n\nThe parenting is not what is burning you out, its your job. \n\nAnd yes, as a former academic researcher, him taking three years off will severely hurt his chances of coming back. Permanent jobs are damn near impossible to find and if he's got one and its close by, he might as well have hit the academic lottery. It doesnt matter how much his boss likes him, his job will be in high demand and wont be there for him.", "YTA - I feel terrible writing that, but you are. My husband and I were in a similar position 4 years ago and we had to drastically change our expectations to fit around our kids. I\u2019m a lawyer as well, I moved roles and sectors to be home for my kids and partner. I know it feels overwhelming now, but start putting feelers out. \n\nAlso there are many reputable agencies that will support you finding care. Again, I was in the same boat (long waitlist for childcare facilities). Ask around and start interviewing. It took me probably a solid 12 months to find someone who works well with our family. She\u2019s been with us for 3 years and we would move heaven and earth to keep her on (increase pay, support her bringing her grandchildren over, extra food, etc). I agree, it\u2019s so hard finding someone you trust, but def start now. \n\nYou might not have time for it, but start seeing a therapist for you. What you said to your partner is really belittling. Remember, you\u2019re in this together. If you start \u201cfighting each other\u201d it\u2019s already over. Apologise to him and start therapy about learning how to communicate your needs in a constructive manner. \n\nBest of luck OP", "YTA. I also read some of your comments. I can understand finding the right fit for a nanny can be hard but have you looked into a company that help you find one that will fit with your family and send a different one when needed?\n\nYour husband deserves to be able to go after his career too. And what you said crossed a line.   I know are are stressed and at a point but getting your husband to give up his work is not the answer when you both have the means to pay for professional help.", "YTA.

I'm the breadwinner while he is the primary care giver for our daughter. Our schedules work for the most part but I really need more time to decompress. I'm a lawyer while my husband works in academic research. Our days start by me getting up around 7 to get breakfast ready and my daughter would wake up around 7:30. I will feed her and then go take a bath together. My husband would be up by 8:30am and he will be dressed and ready by 9 as I leave. I try to finish work till 5-6 but end up usually finishing by 7:30-8pm on good days. \n\nDuring this time, my husband cleans up the house, makes lunch and dinner, drops of lunch for me and runs his errands for the house. He also plays and takes care of our daughter while also teaching her both our native languages. He will get some of his work for his job that he can do remotely done when she takes her naps. He will leave for work around 6:30, his work is walking distance from our place while mine is a drive away. Since, I'm often not able to make it home, our daughter will be with either his mother, my sister or our neighbor who also has a 2-year-old. This puts additional pressure on my plate to get home quicker to relieve these people from this additional duty. My work already required me to work twice as hard as most of my counterparts because this is such a high-pressure job with a lot of internalized sexism. I had cut my maternity leave short and come back early because my coworkers warned me about how people were eying my clients and position. Just to prove myself, I had to work even harder. \n\nWhen I get home, I'm burnt out. I don't get any time to decompress really as I have to take care of my daughter as soon as I get back until her bedtime at 9. I'd then finish whatever little work I can which I had to abandon to get home in time. By 10 I'm spent and just crash in my bed and maybe get an hour to myself until I fall asleep. My husband will come back around 12-12:30am and fall asleep. \n\nThis was working but I'm spent. I can't do this anymore. If my husband quits his job, I won't have the extra pressure to rush home nor would I have to wake up early and take care of our daughter right away. I'd also be able to get at least some time to myself. His job doesn't really pay as much and mostly covers his personal expenses and a few bills which my salary can easily cover. I pay for most of the stuff here and it's important that I am able to work at my best for that salary\n\nI had a conversation with him where he was very defensive and didn't want to quit as its fulfilling and has been his dream for a long time despite it not being practical at this point in life and well out of frustration, I called his job a hobby since it doesn't pay much and doesn't really contribute to the household. I know it was harsh but at the end of the day it is the truth. He's not been his cheery self for a few days now and is barely talking to me.

Then he goes to work doing something that means something to him. When is his couple of hours to himself? I have been a stay at home mom and a working mom. Both are exhausting, yet you seem to think that you having me time is more important than his work that he loves. Either hire a nanny to come to the house until when he leaves for work (because you don\u2019t like daycare) and keep them there until you get your me time.

He does the majority of everything to do with child and house and it\u2019s still not enough for you. You want him to quit his job, let you lie in, let you work late, give up his own enjoyments so that you can \u201cdecompress\u201d. This is what being a working parent is.

I would do anything to not have to be the bread winner, but both my husband and I realize that it has to be me. At least for now. I love spending time with her, but I cannot have the fact that I need to get her looming over my head while I'm at work. I can't afford to make mistakes in that cesspool.", "I am at 3000 characters, there was so much I wanted to talk about.", "While it should be included, doesn't change anything. If the kid is important, move to a different area & job that affords a significant presence in the child's life.\n\nOtherwise, she doesn't actually care about raising a kid, just her own needs(cause \"career\" trumps all).", "Well done. Very succinctly put forth.", "It's not the best but it's what we have", "Many workplaces have a no compete clause in their contracts, meaning you cannot work for a \u2018competitor\u2019 once you quit your current place of work for however many months.", "It's so sad for the husband and child. Both are treated like burdens she's having to carry instead of being loved and respected family members.", "*The wait-list.* The one she's definitely not actually on.", "It\u2019s academia. Personal relationships matter, but it\u2019s still an incredibly competitive field, and in three years he won\u2019t be in touch with any recent developments in his field that haven\u2019t been made public (which usually takes years due to publishing standards). \n\nYTA, and don\u2019t blame it on your job because 1.) you haven\u2019t tried to look at possible alternatives and 2.) you belittled your partner\u2019s life work. Get off of your incredibly expensive high horse, apologise, and try looking for alternatives.", "Calculating on a safe return after three years is extremely unreliable. No matter what you tell yourself here", "Okay but you didn't answer the second half of the question. What if the roles were reversed? Suppose your husband earned several times what you currently earn as a lawyer, and asked you to quit your legal hobby and take care of the home? Would you happily agree? Would you not be offended by him relegating your entire career as an attorney to a mere hobby?", "Well you\u2019ve certainly got it all figured out, what do you need us for?", "Don\u2019t forget to tell your husband what you will be sacrificing in this little negotiation, since you want him to give up, weekends, and presumably family time, since it doesn\u2019t sound like, you two spend any other time together. \nYou are all anout what he should give up, and don\u2019t care much for his fulfilment, so if you approach this conversation like that, expect him to rebuff you.", "Wonderful, good luck!", "I find it really hard to believe that ALL of the recommended babysitters or nannies hired were terrible. In my experience, as an Early Childhood Educator, parents who run through caregivers are usually difficult or let their child get away with anything. There were multiple nannies and only one common denominator: your family. Also wow, sound more condescending.", "This reads like the plural  \u201cyou and your husband\u201d and not necessarily you specifically. \n\nThe point being made is: Either y\u2019all are hiring the wrong people or yall are horrible to work for.", "Why is it that you view nothing as your fault? It\u2019s either your husband who is wrong, or it\u2019s your work\u2019s fault. \nWhat responsibility are you taking? Spent the weekend researching nannies and daycare yourself since your look down on his choices so much.", "Where did they go?", "Most of the time, especially for a kid as old as two, parents will outright ask the nanny to take the kid outside at least for one and a half hour....\n\nI wouldn't be surprised how she just assumed it's the same as everywhere else. The battery sounds like an unfortunate one time experience. (Also damn, I'd be so uncomfortable babysitting with cameras everywhere)", "You can't even give your daughter 2 hours of attention a day \n\nNo. I don't think you feel bad and I don't think you are a good parent \n\nYou care more about your success and happiness than your family and their happiness", "> I would do anything to not have to be the bread winner, but both my husband and I realize that it has to be me.\n\nWhat steps have you taken to change this? Because you've made several comments along these lines indicating you'd rather have more time at home, but unless you're actually doing something about it, then it's all just talk. And talk is cheap.\n\nIf you're serious you should be working towards changing this.", "The word count doesn't apply to edits at this point. You can add to it without being penalized.", "Honestly OP, I don't think you should be putting so much pressure on yourself to be the sole bread winner. Your work life balance sounds absolutely crazy and working 50+ hours a week with no time with your family isn't healthy. Do you not have family nearby like your or his parents/siblings that would be happy to help with childcare? \n\nI would see a financial planner as well to work out how you can achieve your financial goals or your acceptable standard of living without killing running yourself into the ground with work. It may be that you have to make some lifestyle changes or it'll take you longer than planned to reach your goals. \n\nGentle YTA for being dismissive of your hubby's job.", "Those are not typically enforceable. They're just used to scare you into thinking like op does. They can't prevent you from working.", "Agreed :( I hope that she gets a wakeup call about what's truly important before she loses both.", "If he asked me to quit my job and was making more than me, I'd do it. Law used to be fun and my passion until I got my job and saw how truly awful it was. I thought I could change things around here, so I tried to get up the ladder. I did make some positive changes and I like to think help pave the path for other women along with my mentor. Then I got pregnant. The fight to change things is no longer worth it. I hate my job now. I would do anything to have the passion and excitement he feels about his job.", "Sorry about my tone. I know you're trying to help but I'm a little on edge and the love of my life hasn't spoken to me for the last few days despite me apologizing multiple times.", "Feels like you're taking your day out on op rather than offering anything constructive at this point. I'm saying this as someone who agrees with your premise and I don't really like op.", "What success? I have to work the way I do to be able to keep paying the bills. I haven't gunned for anything on a professional level since I came back. I don't care about promotions or titles or getting the bigger office. All I care about is that I am able to provide my daughter with a good future and hopefully not miss out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFine I'm a shit parent. You got what you want? Don't you think I know that. Do you want me to give her up? Should I just sign away my rights and just run away?

The company will want to protect their own interests, which is why the clause exists for workplaces where information is sensitive.", "So true. :(", "So it kind of sounds like you're burnt out from your job more than your parental responsibilities, and you're envious that he enjoys his job while you hate yours.\n\nRather than making him quit his job so you're both miserable, why don't you look at changing to something less intense? You might take a paycut, but would it be more of a paycut than him giving up his job entirely? And even if the answer is yes, surely the improvement to your quality of life would be worth it?", "His job that you want him to quit\u2026", "So you're trying to make him as miserable as you are?\n\nGet out of this heinous job, find something with a charity or non profit and make a difference the way you wanted to. Respect your partner's work and accept that earning less does not diminish the work of the worker - it diminishes the priorities society has established.\n\nMaybe you can save your marriage if you wake up now. Your job is not more important.", "I would say I hope he leaves you. But, you probably be happy this way he can have sole custody and you don't have to bother with your child.", "The love of your life is hurt because you chose to put yourself and your career above him, your kids and your own mental health. The love of your life is hurt because you chose to belittle his field of work, and you told him to quit something he genuinely loves to do so you can continue to self sabotage yourself to ruins.", "I had a great day but thanks for your concern \n\nSorry for hating dead beat parents who can't be fucked raising their kids.\nMaybe it's from working with amazing kids who have parents like OP. \n\nOther people have already offered solutions and OP just doesn't care and doesn't want to make a change.", "God i can see ur gonna be the mom that goes \u201cwell i guess im just a terrible mother then\u201d if ur daughter brings up issues she has with u in the future", "The problem is that you are extreme. You act like you must live in poverty, or are rich and working 15+hours a day. You do the extreme thing with the nanny situation too. \n\nFind another job while you are working. It's not that hard. Lower your standards of living. You don't need the best school districts, your baby isn't even going to school yet.  You can even downsize. Sure your kid will have a bit less, but she'll know your face.", "Bullshit. You can't be a very good lawyer if you are only making the minimum with your husband's income as well \n\nYour pride is far bigger than the love for your daughter or husband \n\nThis entire post you have painted yourself as the victim but the truth is husband is working far more hours than you, as he is being the parent and working. \n\nAnd you don't understand it isn't about making interent strangers happy. It's about actually taking care of the kid YOU DECIDED TO HAVE", "Try to let the haters roll off your back. As a former CF person that has a 2 yr old daughter now, I commiserate with you. You're doing your best. \n\nFortunately I was in the position to give up my job and eventually care for her.\n\nYou might consider a foreign au pair as an option if it's available to you... I know a family where I live that has one and they love it.", "I don't have any concern for you or your day. I was being polite. Chill the fuck out. Nobody likes a bully. Just because op is an asshole doesn't mean you should be also.", "I am not making the minimum. I make good money but that requires me to work the way I do.

We also have a house fund because soon my daughter will need more space in a few years.", "We don't have space for that right now. Maybe once we're able to move."]}
