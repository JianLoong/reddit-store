I was stranded an hour from home in a bad area, unable to find a way back. The trains were shut down, and in my desperation, I called my sister Morgana for help. Her response shocked me; she said she was too tired from work and wouldn't come to pick me up. She suggested I either walk or wait at the station until the trains resumed.  \nTragically, my decision to wait led to a mugging. I was violently attacked, lost my wallet, IDs, and even my computer. Fortunately, a police officer came to my aid and gave me a ride back home. I made it clear to my sister that I would never forget this incident and that she shouldn't expect help from me when she needed it.  \nFast forward to the present, it's been ten years, and my parents treated the family to a cruise. My girlfriend and I made a trip out of it, driving down two days ahead to stay in a hotel. Then, at midnight on the eve of our cruise, my sister called in a panic. She had gotten into a fight with her boyfriend, who had subsequently left with the car. Now, she was unable to drive to the cruise dock the next day, stranded outside her boyfriend's house with only her purse.  \nShe asked us to make a ten-hour round trip to pick her up, which would have disrupted our plans significantly. In response, I texted her that sometimes life throws curveballs, and she should wait for the buses to start running to get back home. I figured she'd be okay waiting outside on a bench all night, just like I had all those years ago. She called me an asshole, and her boyfriend eventually returned, driving them to the cruise together. \n\nShe told our parents about the incident.  \nTo my surprise, our parents sided with me, stating that she had done the same thing to me in the past and that if she was going to treat me poorly, I had every right to reciprocate. Eventually, she apologized, but I reiterated that she shouldn't expect me to be there for her in the future, given her past actions.  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for refusing to help my sister after she left me stranded years ago?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1694047124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c1elc/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_sister_after_she/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had a phone to call an uber to get her to a hotel - not an option that existed for you 10 years ago.", "NTA - You had the right to refuse just based on the 10-hour round-trip; the vengeance for past mistreatment is just icing on the cake. Given the fact that your sister wouldn't help you when you were in a genuinely dangerous situation, really makes it ridiculous that she expected you to help her when the worst thing that would happen to her is not getting to enjoy a vacation.", "NTA.  Revenge is a dish best served cold.", "NTA. Fuck around, find out.", "NTA", "NTA. She wasn't there for you when you needed help, and I didn't see anywhere in your post where she apologized prior to her *own* predicament. I'd also note that things have changed since 10 years ago, and services like uber and lyft are far more common.", "She left you and you got assaulted. \nYou didn\u2019t go pick her up and she tragically\u2026.might have missed out on a cruise? \nNo way, NTA. I\u2019d take that grudge to my grave.", "The two situations are totally different. If she had an immediate concern for her safety, she should have called someone closer than 5 hours away.

But\u2026you definitely could do with some therapy to let go of resentment from 10 years ago. I\u2019m not saying what happened to you wasn\u2019t traumatizing - it sounds absolutely terrible. But to be holding it as a grudge for 10 years waiting for a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment is a bit messed up.", "INFO: AITA loves these tales of retribution, but if this really happened, how do you feel after finally acting on the grudge you've nurtured for a decade?

And most defintely nta!\n\nKarma can be a bitch.", "NTA.  You're not committing to a 10 hour drive means she would have had to miss a cruise, her not being willing to drive could have cost you your life, and you did suffer significant consequences.  I'm glad your parents defended you here.  Yes, therapy might be good, but you'd be well within your rights to demand your sister wasn't allowed on the cruise in the first place, or any other family vacations.", "NTA.  Turnabout is fair play.", "Nta at all! My god I'm glad you survived", "NTA even without the backstory (a last minute ten hour drive is an unreasonable ask) nor do you owe your sister a relationship after she declined to come get you or help brainstorm a solution. Full stop. Choosing to disengage from you in that moment of need is enough to permanently end the relationship. But unless there\u2019s something missing, your sister is not solely responsible for the attack you endured, just as you wouldn\u2019t have been if she were attacked on that bench overnight. She didn\u2019t drive you to that area and leave you; she didn\u2019t agree to pick you up and then not show up. Even if she had started towards you, you could have been attacked when she was en route. If she were exhausted, she could have been in an accident on the way, or you both could have been together.

You noped out. She dealt with her drama.", "This is the point that many people commenting on this post are overlooking. OP was mugged and could have been killed. And, the sister has NEVER apologized for her actions towards OP?! This is why their parents took OPs side on this matter.

She ended up having gallstones and had to have surgery. But outside of a medical emergency (cause I am not cruel) I am not going to make sure she gets to go on a nice cruise when she couldn't be bothered to help me back then.", "It was not a gotcha moment.\n\nI have been consistent with her since that moment. I don't give her rides, we don't exchange gifts, I don't hang out with her. If my parents invite us both places, I go because I want to see my parents and other siblings. I don't have the energy or the spite to continue a grudge that long.\n\nBut yeah, saying back to her what she said to me felt good.", "I don't see why therapy is needed when it took OP's sister ten years and having been stranded herself to realize what an AH she was. Not rescuing her for something less of a problem is itself therapy.", "This comment is scarily detached from actual human emotion.", "I went on a cruise with my parents that my sister happened to attend. \n\nI am also not looking to punish my parents by making them decide which child to have at which event. I can be in the same room as my sister and not bring other people into it. It's been ten years. But I have been clear with her, that the only reason I see her is because my parents invite her. I am not friends with her, I am not close.", "You only get banned if you break rule one repeatedly without changing your behavior. \n\nOh, and by the way, \"I'd say [blank] but then I'd get banned\" is going to count as one of your warnings as you're trying to get around the rules.", "We really don't. I think the longest conversation we have had in ten years was about my mom getting skin cancer removed. I am not gonna make my life harder for her.", "Yeah, so she probably still doesn't understand why you were ever even upset about it, right? Your sister sounds as clueless and self-absorbed as mine. I haven't talked to mine in nearly a decade (except for once for 12 seconds earlier this year when it was unavoidable). I hope to never see her again.", "Uber started in 2009 but who knows if drivers would pick up someone in a bad area by 2013?", "It was kind of you to drive her during a medical emergency.  I would have told her to call 911 or Uber.  But I can be stone cold when I've been screwed.  You are, again, NTA.", "You conveniently ignored the hard part of my question.", "I get how 10 years ago feels like some archaic time in your distant past. I'm just reminding you that cellphones and Uber were in full swing back then.", "I keep my morals at \"would I drive a stranger at a party to the ER if they needed it?\" And the answer is yes. If my sister had been a stranger at a party having medical issues that needed attention, I would have absolutely have driven her.\n\nLeaving to drive five hours to get her for a cruise? Absolutely not.", "That's not a fair question to ask, and if OP has any brains of course they're not answering that.  It's a lose-lose question, no matter the answer.", "No, you asked a load question that there is no real answer for.", "I think she is giving as much care for her sister as her sister did to her. It's not a concern, so it's not worthy of an answer."]}
