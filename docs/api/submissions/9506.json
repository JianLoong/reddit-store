Speak to a lawyer.  She doesn't want to end up with nothing so she's blowing hot air but she may be nasty enough so that you both end up with nothing.\n\nThere's a reason why your mom only got 6% and everyone else got more.  Your mother wasn't your grandmothers dependant and she wasn't left out of the will (so you can't argue she wasn't forgotten about).", ">I sent her a text telling her that I won\u2019t be signing this paper, but I\u2019m willing to work something out so long as it\u2019s in writing,\n\nNo. Stop. Do not give her *anything*. Sign nothing, agree to nothing, just say \"No.\"\n\nNTA for standing up for yourself\n\n>she is threatening to take this all the way to the end and says the lawyers will take all of the money if I want to take it to court and nobody will get anything\n\nDo not take legal advice from your opponent.", "Op's grandma left OP's mom the lowest share. My guess is grandma knew that OP's mom is the least deserving- and she gave 30% to her grandchild precisely so that OP doesn't have to be dependent on her mom. \n\nMom is proving grandma's instincts correct.\n\nOP, get a good lawyer and after this settles, AVOID your mom as much as you can. \n\nNTA.", "Yeah, I\u2019m wondering if the friend really \u201ctricked\u201d grandma at all tbh.", "Your mum is trying to scare you and it's working. \nConsulting with a lawyer will not make you bankrupt, and would probably make you aware of options and protections you didn't know you had.", "NTA. Your inheritance still trumps hers, so if you have to choose between giving it to her or spending it all on lawyers, at least the lawyer option drains her as well for some \"you reap what you sow\" justice.", "i am in Australia so this may not apply but I know some of the universities here have free or subsidised clinics where law students give advice (under the eye of their lecturers etc).  We also have legal aid for people on low incomes. Perhaps see if there is so similar near you.\n\nmind you I always thought legally contesting a will meant any fees come out of the estate ie the estate hires a lawyer who defends the will. Who is the executor and has the will been through probate?   \nNTA for wanting to keep what has been legally bequeathed to you.", "NTA. Get a lawyer. She is money hungry. And I would tell you to block her, but don't; just don't respond. Anything she sends your way, including her friends and other family members, should be documented for the case.", "NTA. Make sure that\u2019s even a legit letter from the lawyer by checking against their website and calling for verification they sent it. If it\u2019s real, get your own lawyer. \u2018Trust me\u2019 is bs. Your mom is greedy.", "Your cousins really signed over $56,000 because they felt bad? You need a lawyer because there has to be other information you're not aware of going on. NTA. Go get a lawyer before you sign anything.", "NTA", "Do not trust her!\n\nDo not give your (mom) **bully** money!\n\nDo not believe her threats, those are empty!\n\nNTA", " I recommend a lawyer, I'm just here to point out assholes and occasionally make one of myself.", "NTA.\n\n> She also guilted me telling me how hard this court case has been and that she has had a hard year.\n\nVs.\n\n> Now she is threatening me with lawyers and telling me to is whole ordeal is going to be expensive and mediation starts on 2/15 so I better get a lawyer.\n\nSame person said these two things?  Seems like if this was such an ordeal, the last thing I\u2019d want to do is go through it again.\n\nAlso, the \u201ctrust me to take care of you part\u201d.  Ask the McDonald brothers how that worked out for them.", "Your mother literally threatened you. She's so vindictive that she's happy to force you to spend the inheritance on lawyers if it means you won't get anything. That right there is proof that you can't trust her. She's greedy and selfish. Don't give her a cent. NTA", "You definitely need a lawyer.", "NTA. I get that you are worried about what it will cost to initially consult an estate lawyer, but you need to get over that because your mom is committed to suing. You need to know what your rights are and how strong a case she has. This isn't going away if you avoid consulting an attorney. It will be worse if you don't. You will have handed her the power to walk all over you in court because you have left yourself uninformed and undefended. Whereas when you go to a consult you might just hear an attorney confidently reassure you that she doesn't have a leg to stand on, that she will be laughed out of court, and will owe you legal cost fees. Maybe you hear more mixed news. Maybe you even get advised to hand over the inheritance immediately because your case is so flimsy. Who knows. But your weakest possible position is to postpone reaching out for help and information. It's also the most stressful position, because you are left to worry without information. Getting informed will allow you to make the least costly, least stressful, most productive decisions for your interests. Call the bar association today and ask them for referrals.", "How is it so easy in America to go against a will? Can someone explain that to me?", "NTA get your own lawyer and DO NOT communicate with her any longer, have the lawyer do that, respect your Grandmothers wishes", "NTA. You sign it over, you get nothing. You fight it and you *may* get nothing with lawyers getting the bulk. \n\nFight this like hell, to the end. Your mum is\u2026I just would not let her get away with this shit.", "NTA If your mother got her share, the cousins\u2019 share, and the 50% recouped from the friend less 75,000 and legal fees, she probably ended up with close to $200,000. Why does she need your money?", "Hmm...a mum who is heartbroken that her own son and mother do not give her their money but who has no problem taking them to court...so, in her opinion, everybody else must be loyal to her but she is entitled not to do that.\n\nNTA.", "OP, absolutely do not say that to her and especially don't put that in writing to her. Your mom is determined to take this to court, and when she does that statement will be portrayed as an admission that it's her money.", "The mom going to sue her child over his grandma's inheritance is not an asshole according to you?", "Even though she said exactly the same thing?", "The way I read it, she didn't exactly win the first case.  It sounds more like a negotiated settlement.  The other woman walked away with some money + her lawyer's fees covered.   Many people will settle just to avoid dragging out the case."]}
