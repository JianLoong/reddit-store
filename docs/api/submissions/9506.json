If it had been there wouldn't have been a settlement.   \n2.  The fact that the cousins signed over their inheritance (probably after being threatened by OP's mom with her nuclear option to bankrupt the estate and bury them in legal fees.)

IF the will had been invalidated or set aside there would be no need for your to sign away any legal rights since in the absence of a valid will you'd have no legal rights.\n\nAssuming you are in the US, FIRST start with contacting the lawyers handling your grandmother's estate and politely enquire what is going on with your inheritance.

Be clear with them that you have no intention of disclaiming any of your legal rights to your inheritance--and follow that up with a letter reiterating your intent to claim your portion of the estate.\n\nIMMEDIATELY respond to the letter from your mom's lawyer saying that you will NOT be signing away your right to your portion to the estate under any circumstances and ask for all details about this \"mediation\" on February 15th.

Send this via trackable mail and make a copy of the letter.   \n\n\nCall your local bar association and get a list of lawyers in your area who specialize in estate law.

You can also complain to that state bar association if indeed a real lawyer is threatening a frivolous lawsuit in an already litigated matter.
