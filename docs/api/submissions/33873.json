A minute? 10 minutes?

One thing that\u2019s verrrrry consistent is that dudes, especially dudes under the age of 25, have a tendency to think if a woman only gets upset about something when they\u2019re already in a bad mood, it\u2019s not a \u201creal\u201d grievance. *This is extremely false.* \n\nWomen, particularly women with less relationship experience, are told from the time we\u2019re very young that being angry or unpleasant is never okay. Treating us like our anger is not the airing of legitimate frustrations because it only comes out when we\u2019re too exhausted and beaten down to hold it back not only resends the old bullshit message that we\u2019re expected to be sweet and nice all the time, it also tells us that you don\u2019t believe we can be rational when we\u2019re upset, which is completely false (and gives us still more legitimate reasons to be angry with you). \n\nIt\u2019s not okay for your wife to refuse to work on venting her frustrations in ways that you can understand, and if she\u2019s criticizing you severely and regularly, she needs to work on controlling that behavior. But if you\u2019re so clueless that you don\u2019t know sitting on your butt doing nothing when you\u2019ve already been home long enough to get engrossed in TV while your sad, tired, frustrated wife prepares and serves you dinner, then you can count on her being frustrated with your insensitive behavior in perpetuity. \n\nYou should both look for some resources for improving your emotional intelligence and develop skills for advocating for yourselves that don\u2019t include being oblivious to your partner\u2019s needs (you) or constantly nitpicking in ways that are too critical and vindictive to encourage productive problem solving and vulnerability (her).", "INFO: was she like this before marriage?", "NTA\n\nBut you also need to stop apologizing when you don't need to.", "Yeah, he was watching TV while she served dinner...
