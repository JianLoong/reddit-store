They\u2019re just honoring his wishes lol", "NTA. Your brother and his wife sound absolutely perfect for each other in all of their entitled selfishness. The fact that she has this pattern of trying to force relationships is gross.

She is making it about herself and her precious crotch-gremlins and sounds like she thinks she can make them one big happy family. That isn't going to happen, and if the adult kids have no interest in getting to know their half-siblings, it's their choice.", "NTA.

Why not say so?\n\n\"I have talked to them, they have no desire to meet your kids.

It\u2019s not really anything to do with you either\u2026", "NTA\n\nShe needs to knock it off.", "You said his abandoned sons are grown?  I'd say it's their decision to make then.

I understand you don\u2019t want to reveal your position and you\u2019re not obligated to, certainly if the boys don\u2019t want you to either, but instead of being harsh to her you need to either clam up and cut her off too, or further involve yourself by explaining to the boys what she\u2019s doing and ask how they\u2019d like you to handle it/possibly communicate to her.", "NTA. You were just giving her good advice. And there is no reason for you to help her facilitate this idiot bUt faMILeee plan of hers.

You're not an asshole for telling her its probably a bad idea.", "NTA what a B", "Why is this your business?\n\nThe older two are adults and completely capable of telling her to F off.

The same woman who called you a liar about her deadbeat husband now thinks the children he abandoned owe HER something? When she pays all the child support her husband blew off, maybe.

I hope you can encourage their connection eventually and help protect the older sons from having to interact with their dad. Wife needs to seriously butt out of the situation.
