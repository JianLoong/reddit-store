Why should you foot the bill for her and her baby daddy's poor decisions.  It's the baby daddy's grandparents turn.", "NTA, you have every right to be unhappy given that thus far you have been a part time care taker and provide partial support to your daughter and grandchild.

Your daughter is being foolish and irresponsible and now she needs to face the consequences of her ill thought out actions.

You have every right to tell the truth, she needs to face her own responsibilities.", "NTA , because you are only trying to get her to take up her responsibilities as a mother and provider however because you enabled her behavior the last time she thinks that going forward you will give in and do the same. Also question are the two children for the same father ?", "NTA\n\nHer irresponsibility is not *your* responsibility. She doesn't need two kids if she can't afford the one she has.\n\nI don't think it's wrong for you to be upset when she is using you as a babysitter and a free place to stay. You didn't sign up to raise your grandkids.", "NTA. Is the girl familiar with birth control?", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter is my sister. When she got pregnant the first time, we bent over backward to help her. I became a single teen mom when she was 15, and she didn't learn from my mistakes. While I was still struggling when she got pregnant at 18, I still did everything I could to help her, as did my parents, who were not wealthy, and we all worked full time. When she got pregnant with her second, we were not happy and shared that as we were all still supporting her. She called us names and was horrible to us until she called crying for help. Less than a year after that, there was baby #3. She blamed us for her continued struggles and how we never helped enough or supported her in her desire to have kids. Even though I had previously moved out of my deceased grandmothers home that I lived in and rented a place so she could live for free to raise them. She let it fall in disrepair, and it was condemned. A year later, she was pregnant with #4. There were complications, and she lost the child and had a hysterectomy. Even more sadly, our family was so relieved/happy we actually felt bad enough we got therapy because, who thinks like that?! \n\nIf you don't stick to making her take responsibility, you'll be paying for her and her kids like my parents still are for my sister 9 years later. \n\nI refused to have sex for so long after I got pregnant on BC as a teen.

We're going to shower them with gifts and help and attention!\" and then the young Mom gets used to being the \"young Teen Mom\", so they get pregnant AGAIN, and are shocked that the reaction isn't overwhelming delight.

One accidental pregnancy in college is one thing, and it's great that you were willing and able to help her out, but a second one?? When she's still not in a position to raise and support a child on her own? Did she learn nothing from the first? Well, by that I mean, did the first one not drive home the reality of her fertility, and motivate her to do more to prevent pregnancy? \n\nBut of course, by asking \"did she learn nothing?\" I am of course walking right into the following response, \"uhh yeah, she learned she can get knocked up and mommy and daddy will pick up the burden so she can keep living her life,\" which yeah, I agree, it is likely that that is how she chose to interpret the situation. It sucks when people like OP decide to help out their grown kids in a bad situation, and instead of appreciating the help and making a point to do better, the kid chooses to believe they can just be reckless and won't have to deal with any real consequences from their actions.", "NTA sounds like she\u2019s so used to being accommodated that she thinks everyone will just jump at the chance to do many more years of what I\u2019m assuming is free labor.

It also sounds like she should be considering seeking child support from the fathers of these children.", "NTA\n\nLook, my mother got pregnant with me very young.

Although sometimes I wish my parents were more involved or that we could do more to see them, and they complain a lot that we don't visit more, etc.... But it is what it is.

I paid rent to my parents, they watched my kid on weekends when I was at work. Now that I own my own home, they watch my child in the morning and get them to school, and sometimes when I have to work late they fill in that gap by picking my child up, or if I have to work nights she stays at their house. Notice this isn't them being the childcare provider.

Then sit down with her afterwards and express your concerns and any changes you feel necessary, which IMO are that she needs to figure out how she's going to support herself, share that info with you, and an ETA of when she can strike out on her own if that's the ultimate plan. OP you're not enforcing your adult daughter to be responsible for her life. It's probably out of love and a desire to provide for your child, so I can't bring myself to call you a full AH for that. \n\nShe's TA though. I feel very confident in saying that she is overtly relying on y'all to finance her decision to have another child, which is selfish. Presumably she cannot provide for herself and two children if she's still living at home with one child. She's presuming on her current financial situation which is very clearly supplemented (fully funded?) by you and your husband. Y'all obviously don't intend to continue to financially support her indefinitely. Complaining about it or making a snide comment isn't the way to move forward.

Perhaps she thought you would be super excited to have a second grandchild. Obviously, you\u2019re not. NTA. This is tough. You may need to finally enact tough love, and just have her find other living accommodations (perhaps, with the father of her second child).

Also, isn\u2019t another grandchild a happy thing even if the situation is not? Straight up telling her you weren\u2019t happy for her was a bit harsh. She won\u2019t ever forget that moment.
