INFO: what part of your post made them start talking about prison? Some kind of visa thing?", "I read your post a couple times trying to figure out what the CEO was upset about. I couldn't see anything wrong.\nNTA. \n\nCongratulations on your accomplishments!", "I\u2019m so confused. NTA. Just out of curiosity if your first language English? Coz maybe surreal has a double meaning in your language?", "NTA. Because this isn\u2019t a situation where you could possibly even be an asshole. This probably doesn\u2019t belong here. Unless you\u2019re leaving out some major details, clearly this CEO guy has some screws loose.", "NTA. You have proof of your doctorate from the university.  I would email your transcript or other proof to the HR director of the company and let them know about the zoom meeting.  Let them know you quit because of the harassment during the meeting and they threatened you with prison.", "Question - do they think you *haven't* got a doctorate? because that's the only way I can make any sense of this. Did you put that you have a doctorate on your application when you got the job?", "This sounds like there's a language barrier issue here.\n\nAlso sounds like some weird cultural issue happening.\n\nNTA.\n\nCongratulations on the doctorate.\n\nI wouldn't have quit.\n\nBut, I would definitely not want my company doing business with these people.", "I find this story strange.   NTA I guess but it doesn't compute.", "INFO: \n1. what language specifically did your CEO find objectionable? Eg, Did you use profanity in your post? Did you insult any people or companies?\n2. What specific facts/statements in your post did the CEO find implausible, so that they would accuse you of being a liar and a fraud?\n3. Are you bring given a chance to prove the truth of your post? Have you asked for an opportunity to present your evidence?", "NTA Apparently all of them never made it past Elementry School. Such a waste of their time. To bad you quit, this is definitly an HR problem. I would have given a copy to HR, tell them they might check on their education, since none of them had the werewithall to check the Uni you graduated from, before accusing you of lying, fraud, ect. Also remember pointing a finger at a person ... 3 are pointing back at you.", "Are you a woman? In a patriarchal country? Can\u2019t imagine the issue otherwise.", "NTA - there is nothing wrong with using the word surreal. It just indicates how you were feeling about your situation at that time. The CEO is the asshole.", "I'm struggling to work out what you could've possibly done wrong, and how on earth they were upset with you and mentioning prisonn\n\nNTA at all. Any further context as to why they may of been so mad?", "You should sue if you can. Making false threats, spreading libel, harassment and intimidation that caused you to feel unsafe. They gaslit you to the nines but I don't think you can sue for being gaslit lol", "and you didnt think to prove all of this?  if u have transcripts etc of your education and age etc then they are in the wrong.  they cant put in prison for something that is the truth that can be proven in a court of law.  sounds like some missing parts of the story here", "According to Merriam-Webster, surreal means \"marked by the intense\u00a0irrational reality of a dream.\" It doesn't mean unreal. It's a whole different prefix. Unfortunately, it sounds like your CEO is an idiot. I would say he should crack open a dictionary from time to time, but let's be honest, if he saw this definition he'd probably ask why you were posting about your dreams on LinkedIn.

If there was nothing they could imprison you for then why quit?", "This makes no sense at all.", "NTA  congratulations on all you\u2019ve achieved. Quitting was a good move. Forget those people and their ridiculous remarks.  You don\u2019t need that negativity in your life.", "I'm going with nah i don't want to accuse you of lying but something is clearly missing here you don't get to CEO while being completely braindead. I also doubt an entire room of adults would react this way to the word surreal", "I think they didn\u2019t believe that I had legit received a doctorate at age 22, and was trying to conceal the fact by saying that it felt surreal, ie not real.  But I\u2019m not sure why they threatened me with prison honestly.", "Happy cake day!\n\nOP, NTA. I also can't figure out what you did wrong, outside of making them jealous of your early success.", "My first language is not English. Surreal to me means that I can hardly believe it.", "I put it on my application. I also have all the transcripts and diploma to back it up. They just didn\u2019t like me saying that it felt surreal I guess..", "1. He didn\u2019t like the word surreal. Maybe thought I was narcissistic or something? And 2. Nothing, I just thanked everyone that helped, the organizations that sponsored me, expressed my feelings of happiness and surreality, and said I look forward to joining X company as a Y associate.", "Basically I got really paranoid that they\u2019d try to frame me for a crime I didn\u2019t commit.", "None of this makes sense, not sure why you would quit a job over this.", "That makes no sense at all I hope you can find another job. Doctorate at 22 is a helluva accomplishment and that's a perfect use of the word 'surreal'.\n\nUnbelievable, fantastic, dreamlike. Not \"a lie\".", "Then that's on them. Seriously? They sound unintelligent or just jealous of your accomplishments. A lot of crabby old people out there.", "Did you go to college at 15? Are you Sheldon Cooper???", "Do they have one of those stupid \u201cif you lied to get your job, we\u2019ll prosecute you\u201d clauses in the employment paperwork? I bet that\u2019s what has their underwear in knots, OP. They don\u2019t know about smart people, or early college programs, or the definition of surreal. You\u2019re fine, kid. NTA, they\u2019re just not terribly bright. Congrats on your Ph.D!", "Yes that\u2019s what it means to me too but does the equivalent word in your language have another meaning? Coz I can\u2019t see how you can get legal threats from the word surreal", "Then these people are just bullies, and you shouldn't have to put up with that for just doing your job. If it was me I'd be asking for back-up from my line-manager, but I appreciate that might be something you feel you can't do in your company. \n\nI can't see you've done anything wrong, they are just playing some power games on you. NTA", "My guess is if the person who objected to your post doesn't speak the language that the past was made in, maybe they ran it through a translator and it translated *surreal* to mean *not real*. \n\nThough you used the word *surreal* correctly, there are certainly shared synonyms between *surreal* and *not real*, like *fantastical*.", "Sounds like your CEO has reading comprehension issues. You\u2019re NTA.", "Some colleges have programs that allow you to start some of the work on that while an undergrad", "It might mean not real, ie fake.", "Another question: you said the CEO of a client. Did your own boss agree with them?", "My own boss said the LinkedIn post was way too personal for a professional setting. But didn\u2019t berate, harass and threaten me like the ceo client did.", "How is that too personal? Unless your degree was completed unrelated to work and your career, then it sounds totally related to your profession.", "You had a huge professional accomplishment and shared it on social media catering to work/professionals. It's not uncommon in my field to see posts from people who have finally passed their CPA/CMA/CFE exams, because it's a lot of work. LinkedIn will even generate posts for people celebrating X years at a company. It doesn't sound like you posted some r/LinkedInlunatics content.\n\nYou should be able to be proud and share your professional accomplishments, and LinkedIn isn't an inappropriate place to do that.", "The CEO's reaction itself is pretty surreal!", "NTA", "Some of them make it to that point either by money (ahem, Elon Musk) or by birth (Abigail Disney, any Trump) so I can totally believe that a CEO would do something like that.", "So why the heck did you quit your job?!?!", "Getting a degree is a professional accomplishment though? You\u2019re NTA"]}
