She\u2019s gone through a lot in her life, and I\u2019ve always cared for her. In 2021, during the pandemic, she fell sick, and I looked after her every day after work, even assisting her with basic tasks.

When she moved to Mumbai for work, she avoided me until the last moment, and when I couldn\u2019t meet her due to a work commitment, she accused me of being a bad friend. Later, I visited her in Mumbai to talk, but she ignored me and embarrassed me in front of her friends.\n\nShe eventually returned to Kolkata after losing her job in Mumbai, and I helped her by getting her work from my freelance clients. On my birthday, she didn\u2019t attend my party and gifted me a bottle of rum despite knowing my father\u2019s alcoholism issues, which led to a disastrous incident. When I share my problems, she belittles them and tries to one-up me with her own issues.\n\nDuring a party, she didn\u2019t defend me when another girl was gossiping about me; instead, she agreed with the gossip. Moreover, when the guy she was seeing left her, she blamed me for not stopping her from being with him, even though I had tried to advise her.\n\nNow, she\u2019s facing a legal case with a bank for not paying her education loan EMIs and is asking for my help. As a freelancer, I work long hours to save money, and I don\u2019t have the funds she needs.

And if she'll start harassing you, records your calls and save texts, so you can go to the police if things goes downhill.\nShe's a toxic and manipulative woman, who cares only about herself, so you dont need to feel bad for her.\nYou forgave her enough times, while other people would have cut her off ages ago.\nAlso, even if she was a good friends, you wouldnt have been obliged to help.\nSo put yourself first and stand your grounds.", "NTA. She does not see you as a friend but as an exploitable resource. Cut the leech off and be done with it imo.", "You are plan B for her, not a friend.  cut her off and never respond to her messages.", "NTA. She's not a friend. At best, she's a leech. If you pay that will be the last you'll see of her (and your money). \n\nThey're her loans and her responsibility.", "NTA, she is using and abusing you , cut the ties and be better off for it.", "NTA.  You've tolerated her BS and tried to help her far longer than anyone else would. Dump her.", "Easily NTA. No question. This person manipulated and used your kindness and gave nothing in return, yet continues to feel entitled to your time and money. Cut her off immediately.", "OP NTA\n\nShe\u2019s no friend. She\u2019s just been taking advantage of your kindness.  Tell her a firm no, and cut all contact with her.", "NTA. Cut ties, she's not your friend.", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend. Cut this awful person off!", "Bhai. You\u2019re being used. Move on. NTA.", "NTA. She doesn't sound like your friend, and it's not healthy for you to continue giving her so much of your energy when she gives nothing in return. Regardless of your history, I think you need to let her go and focus more on yourself.", "NTA. Your explanation for why you think you might be an AH is that she is in need. If you feel a strong sense of obligation to help those in need, I am sure you can find more worthy recipients of your generosity than someone who repeatedly stomped all over you.", "Honey, she's not your friend.  Friends don't treat each other like this.  NTA and cut off contact with her.  You need to learn not to be a doormat.", "NTA - Whether you have the funds or not is irrelevant. You do not owe her anything. She sounds like a bad friend. Honestly, it took me a very long time in life to learn this and i think everyone needs to be aware.... you do not need a reason to say no.. you do not need a \"reason\" to not want to be friends with a person anymore. You do not have to have your answer believed or validated by that person. You have the funds, but do not want to pay? You don't need an excuse, the answer is just no. I spent a long time in life stuck with horrible friends or bad partners because I was \"waiting\" until I felt I had a justifiable reason to cut ties that the OTHER PERSON would somehow accept as valid... which is absurd. If this woman is causing you more harm than she is introducing happiness to your life then she does not deserve a place in your life. And she will protest that she's not as bad as you think/say, but that's the beauty, you don't need her approval to cut ties. I hope you have (or get) better friends, I'm sorry that you have had such a toxic person in your life.", "NTA. Grab the scissors and cut her off though, she's a user and an abuser. She doesn't deserve your kindness.", "She doesn\u2019t sound like a friend at all. I would definitely cut her off."]}
