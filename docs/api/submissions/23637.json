In 2021, during the pandemic, she fell sick, and I looked after her every day after work, even assisting her with basic tasks.

When she moved to Mumbai for work, she avoided me until the last moment, and when I couldn\u2019t meet her due to a work commitment, she accused me of being a bad friend.

And if she'll start harassing you, records your calls and save texts, so you can go to the police if things goes downhill.\nShe's a toxic and manipulative woman, who cares only about herself, so you dont need to feel bad for her.\nYou forgave her enough times, while other people would have cut her off ages ago.\nAlso, even if she was a good friends, you wouldnt have been obliged to help.\nSo put yourself first and stand your grounds.", "NTA. She does not see you as a friend but as an exploitable resource. Cut the leech off and be done with it imo.", "You are plan B for her, not a friend.  cut her off and never respond to her messages.", "NTA. She's not a friend. At best, she's a leech. If you pay that will be the last you'll see of her (and your money). \n\nThey're her loans and her responsibility.", "NTA, she is using and abusing you , cut the ties and be better off for it.", "NTA.  You've tolerated her BS and tried to help her far longer than anyone else would. Dump her.", "Easily NTA. No question. This person manipulated and used your kindness and gave nothing in return, yet continues to feel entitled to your time and money. Cut her off immediately.", "OP NTA\n\nShe\u2019s no friend. She\u2019s just been taking advantage of your kindness.  Tell her a firm no, and cut all contact with her.", "NTA. Cut ties, she's not your friend.", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend. Cut this awful person off!", "Bhai. You\u2019re being used. Move on. NTA.", "NTA. She doesn't sound like your friend, and it's not healthy for you to continue giving her so much of your energy when she gives nothing in return. Regardless of your history, I think you need to let her go and focus more on yourself.", "NTA. Your explanation for why you think you might be an AH is that she is in need. If you feel a strong sense of obligation to help those in need, I am sure you can find more worthy recipients of your generosity than someone who repeatedly stomped all over you.", "Honey, she's not your friend.  Friends don't treat each other like this.  NTA and cut off contact with her.  You need to learn not to be a doormat.", "NTA - Whether you have the funds or not is irrelevant. You do not owe her anything. She sounds like a bad friend. Honestly, it took me a very long time in life to learn this and i think everyone needs to be aware.... you do not need a reason to say no.. you do not need a \"reason\" to not want to be friends with a person anymore. You do not have to have your answer believed or validated by that person. You have the funds, but do not want to pay? You don't need an excuse, the answer is just no. I spent a long time in life stuck with horrible friends or bad partners because I was \"waiting\" until I felt I had a justifiable reason to cut ties that the OTHER PERSON would somehow accept as valid... which is absurd. If this woman is causing you more harm than she is introducing happiness to your life then she does not deserve a place in your life. And she will protest that she's not as bad as you think/say, but that's the beauty, you don't need her approval to cut ties. I hope you have (or get) better friends, I'm sorry that you have had such a toxic person in your life.", "NTA. Grab the scissors and cut her off though, she's a user and an abuser. She doesn't deserve your kindness.", "She doesn\u2019t sound like a friend at all. I would definitely cut her off.", "You need to learn the difference between a friend and someone you spend a lot of time doing favors for. NTA for not paying the loan but you're an AH to yourself if you don't get some higher standards and decent friends", "This is your best friend ?  I get the impression you just want reinforcement to go NC.  Yeah go ahead... shes not your responsibility.  NTA", "ESH. She's not respecting you. Maybe you should start by respecting yourself.", "NTA", "Lol nta, she is not your friend", "NTA.  That was a lot of unnecessary background.  You never ever have to hand over your money for someone else's debts. It doesn't matter if you have the funds or not. It doesn't matter if you like them or not. It doesn't matter if they're a relative or a friend or a coworker.  It's your money. You choose what to do with it.\n\nAs for whether to stay 'friends' with this person. She doesn't act like your friend. Why should you be hers?", "NTA. She stopped being a friend a few years ago. She\u2019s now in mooch territory.", "NTA - Ask her to GTFO. She is toxic and you need to stop talking to her entirely. Cut her out.", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend you need to stop calling her thar", "NTA.  This girl is not your friend and you need to sever contact", "Why are you friends?", "She's not your friend.\n\nShe uses you when she needs something. It sucks when friendships end, but this one has run its course. don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. \n\nCut ties, then block and delete  her contacts. You deserve better people in your life who are ACTUAL friends.  NTA", "That\u2019s not a friend.", "She isn't your friend", "NTA. She is no longer your friend, and she has proven this over and over.", "NTA. This person is not your friend.", "She is not your friend. You're just a really good doormat. NTA", "She is not your best friend. She is not your friend. Do not give her money. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, but seriously, are you completely this blind. You\u2019re a mark to her, nothing more.", "This person hates you.", "She isn\u2019t your friend, she is a user and she is using you. You are not obliged to pay her debts when she has not treated you as a friend. Give her the flick and find friends that like you for you and not for how much money they can get out of you", "Honestly, you are still friends with her is surprising. You should have cut her off long time ago. Please do it as soon as possible. There should be no excuses for toxic people. One you saw she was making fun of you and embarassing you, you should have cut her off immediately.", "NTA but if you don't cut her out then you are... when will you stop being a doormat? At this stade you just seem pathetic frankly...", "Easy NTA, this person is not your friend. They are a toxic leech and abuser. \n\nYou would be the asshole if you kept up this farce of friendship with a person who belittles you, lies to you, purposely pushes your triggers, doesn't care about you, uses you for their gain, refuses to help you, accuses you, doesn't defend you, belittles you, blames you and is trying to scam you. \n\nPlease read the para above again.. Maybe what I say next is going to be harsh, but I say it with kindness because I feel so bad for you. How could you possibly think a person who does all of these things to you had any emotion to you other than hate/dislike/contempt, let alone BFF status. The fact that you can't see that she doesn't consider you a friend - but probably sees you as a total doormat who puts up with her abuse and is easy to use, is deeply concerning. \n\nPlease please go to therapy, and work on your self esteem and self concept. I can assure you, you will be so much happier without this bloodsucker in your life ! \n\nAlso just go in to this with eyes wide open - if you give her the money, you will never get it back, and then she will try and fleece you for the next thing. It will never end. Plus alarm bells should be ringing in your head - there aren't too many people who get prosecuted by banks for default in your day to day life - it's a sign of her overall character and stability. \n\nAll the best. I hope you cut her off and work on building up yourself !", "No no no definitely NTA. I am sorry that this person had manipulated and emotionally abused you into feeling like you\u2019re in the wrong for these things! She is not your friend, she is a leech who has been taking advantage of you. You deserve better friends than this girl.", "NTA but you really needed our opinions on this?", "NTA - Sharpen your scissors & get on without her!", "\u201cYou constantly treat me with disrespect that I no longer consider you a friend. Lose this number and never contact me again.\u201d\n\nHit send and block. Problem solved. NTA", "Cut ties. This person is in no way your friend. NTA", "ESH\n\nYou for failing to see she is using you and has nothing but contempt and disrespect for you.  She keeps you around because you are a resource to be exploited until it ends.  At which time she will just ignore you.  This may not be popular look but you are flat out being used/exploited and dont even see it.\n\nHer - for the reasons you mentioned.", "You're not obligated to pay for anything for a friend.\n\n>During a party, she didn\u2019t defend me when another girl was gossiping about me; instead, she agreed with the gossip.\n\n And she's not your friend.", "Cut ties with her.  She is not your friend; she's a user. Plus she's toxic.", "Only considering cutting ties with her? OP drop her like a hot rock. Her behaviour is sociopathic. She is not now nor ever has been your friend. You went out of your way to help her on many occasions and she has never returned the favour of the respect. You owe this person nothing. She is TA not you.", "NTA. That is not a friend. You are only good for them when they need something. Grab some beverages and a pair of scissors and celebrate losing roughly 120+ pounds of dead weight. This person will continue to take advantage and manipulate you. When I cut 2 of the most toxic \"friends\" out of my life 10+ years ago they lost their shit because their emotional and mental punching bag told them to get fucked. I felt like a huge overweight monkey had been lifted from my shoulders.", "NTA\nWith friends like her....\nTime to get\nNo explanation needed, I'm sure she'd have lies ready", "NTA & OMG don't give her a dime.  You absolutely need to cut ties with her NOW.  She is using you.  And she is very toxic.  You don't need a toxic person disguised as a friend in your life.  Def go NC with this AH.", "NTA cut her loose, she not a friend, she has shown you time and time again how little she thinks of you.", "That\u2019s no friend of yours", "NTA - Hell no. She is not your friend at all, she uses you constantly. You are her ATM, her backup friend, her punching bag, someone she keeps around only for when she 'needs something'.\n\nValue yourself and get rid of her once and for all. She literally adds nothing good nor positive to your life. No one should be desperate enough to keep her as a friend.", "If this is the summary of your relationship, why are you still \"friends\"?", "NTA but cut ties with her. She's just using you and is no friend.", "Yep, I would say OP is T.A. to themselves. I'm a big believer in 'Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on __me__.'", ">If you pay that will be the last you'll see of her\n\nUntil the next time she needs something from you.", "That first sentence is something I needed someone to tell me about 10 years ago.
