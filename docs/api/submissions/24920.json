The usual server was in there that I had seen before and when we got there he smiled and said hello, and I waved back. I told my husband he must have remembered me from the last time because the last time I was here and ordering food, I made a dad joke which made him and others at my table giggle. The server said he thought what I said but didn\u2019t want to embarrass himself and say it out loud, all jokes of course. \n\nWhen we were almost leaving, the server walked past us and was heading to a table to pick something up and noticed my glass was empty. Just the clarify, I had an empty glass, my husband had an empty glass and bottle and there was an empty bag of crisps. He grabbed my glass, my husbands empty bottle and the packet of empty crisps but left my husbands glass. The glass was empty but there was a little amount of liquid on the bottom from where the ice had melted. \n\nMy husband immediately got annoyed and said that he did that on purpose. I said he took our stuff and went to go pick up what he was originally heading over for so maybe he didn\u2019t have hands for it. He said it\u2019s just a glass of course he could take it too. I said maybe he thought you weren\u2019t done because of the stuff at the bottom and he then got mad at me for defending him. I made it clear that all I was saying is we aren\u2019t sure he did it on purpose and probably didn\u2019t but my husband said he is certain that he did. I made a point of if he was trying to single him out, why did he take his empty bottle, to which I didn\u2019t get a response. My husband said he was done and got up to leave. \n\nWe left and he was in a bad mood with me on the walk home. I tried to move past it and change the subject and he said he didn\u2019t want to talk to me until I agreed with him that it was on purpose. I said I would not do that because I don\u2019t agree. \n\nIt\u2018s the next morning now and he brought it up again and is still upset. He is saying that I should be validating his feelings. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am from the UK, he is from the USA. We have been married for 6 months and have been together for 3 years. It\u2019s not a common thing for him to be jealous, it\u2019s never been a big problem like this. \n\nEdit 2: In the comments there is another thing that explains another reason my partner could be annoyed because I imagined this server as a character in one of my books. It was just a side character, not romantic and I do this all the time because I lack imagination. Further explanation on this can be found below. \n\nUpdate: I have shown him this thread and he said he is hurt. He believes I\u2019ve portrayed this incorrectly and thinks that I\u2019m being hypocritical by needing my feelings validated by strangers online, which yeah I guess I can see a little. \n\nI told him that I\u2019m not listening to the replies insulting him (because I\u2019m not. There are a lot, you guys are brutal) as I know it\u2019s easy to judge others online when you don\u2019t know them, but the overall consensus is that this was a silly thing to be upset over and that\u2019s why I shouldn\u2019t agree with him on this. \n\nI\u2019ve asked him to write out exactly his point of view from this situation so that I can post it here, but I\u2019ve not had that and I\u2019m not sure if I will.

If your husband was having a rough day, those things would really add up. I don't think it necessarily has to mean he's a generally controlling or jealous person. With that said, even if his feelings of jealousy are understandable, that doesn't mean his assumptions made for them are factually true. \n\nAnd again, validating someone's perspective does not mean telling them that what they think is factually true. If you were to validate his feelings, you would tell him that you can see that from his perspective, there are a lot of little things that seem to indicate a kind of closeness. That's all.

I am open to listening to his feelings, but him telling me I am invalidating them by not agreeing and being on his side with what happened is incorrect. I\u2019m more than open to talk about the root of this and why he feels this might be intentional and what caused this outburst and we plan to after the advice given by others on this post.", "I agree with that. Things cant be \"you are obligated to agree with my point or we are going to have a fight.  \nHowever, at least for me, the post was conducted as \"my husband is angry because of this but I dont agree so that means I dont need to mind how he feels about it\". That's where i was coming from.  \nThe problem with this  attitude is that without communication the little things can become huge fights and you would be amazed by how little silly things can be damaging to relationships.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
