You don\u2019t come across as rude or conceited, just a decent person who knows that the types of events she wants to have are likely out of the range of comfortable, available disposable income in your area and you actually care about her friends - you\u2019re being more considerate than she is. I also am kind of floored by her use of \u201cwe\u201d (\u2026\u201dcould help them out\u201d). Does she mean her fianc\u00e9 and herself or does she mean the two of you? If the latter, abso -f**ng-lutely not. Actually, even in the former case - which is likely what I\u2019m guessing - you\u2019re 100% right. If you were okay with possibly not getting repaid, fine. But for her to not repay you and then go straight back into debt, well, then I\u2019d set up a repayment plan if I were you. She spends frivolously and you wanted to help her get back on her feet after a largely unavoidable situation, but she\u2019s jumping right in again, this time when it\u2019s entirely avoidable? She needs to figure out how to replace those champagne and caviar expectations to match her beer and apps reality. It\u2019s not on you. She\u2019s not a great friend. I\u2019m sorry to say it but you seem like you have a soul and you deserve better.", "Completely okay to tell her you're not spending more money on her. You need your money back and it's time that a repayment schedule gets put in place.", "NTA, you're not an asshole about what's going on with the wedding plans.  You're an idiot for not getting her to sign a formal motorized paper explaining the details of your loan and the repayment plan.\n\nThese Bridezillas as they are called spend other people's money for these elaborate destination weddings.  They have their friends pay outlandish prices for a one use outfit.  They have parents on both sides to front the venue, meals and bar.  Then they max out their credit cards.  Or, remortgage the house.\n\nThen they are upset when no one comes.  It all sounds like fun until those bills start coming in.", "NTA - time to start calling in regular repayments", "NTA - first thing is that you never lend money that you aren't prepared to give away if the recipient doesn't pay it back.\n\nEither forget about getting that money back or start asking for a repayment schedule and consider a debt collector if she refuses.  She will manipulate you.\n\nYou are well and truly being played here.  She is using you for money.  Time for you to put a stop to it.  I find it interesting that she's no longer speaking to you.. so no chance of the fancy wedding she was wanting regardless.  She knows she's in the wrong.  \n\nI would never lend/give her or her friends any further money.  Might be time to cut this 'friend' loose.  Because she's not a friend.  She thinks she's entitled to your money.", "NTA. She\u2019s the type of friend who is jealous because you left the small town and got a better paying job. She sees that you having money, even though you earned it, and living in the tiny town you\u2019re from as showing off, even if you\u2019re not. It doesn\u2019t make sense from your standpoint because you\u2019re just trying to get by and saving what you can but if someone you are close to needs money and you have it then you help out. She sees it as you having it so why not give it to her because you don\u2019t need it as much as she does. \n\nYou need to cut her off cold. Text her or get her to sign a paper acknowledging the first loan and that she knows she has to pay it back and give her a date or set up payments. As for the wedding, you\u2019re spot on. It does sound fun but people who don\u2019t have the extra money would rather do something low key and not have to worry about making anyone uncomfortable or upset if they can\u2019t attend the wedding because of money. \n\nHer wedding plans need to take into consideration the lives and income of the guests. It\u2019s nice to dream big but reality says small.", "NTA. She should be paying you back. She isn't and you shouldn't let her be irresponsible by ignoring her financial responsibilities", "NTA - I\u2019d start requesting that she starts making payments soon, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a plan. It sounds like she\u2019s financially using you.", "NTA\n\n\nSeems like she sees the loan as a gift, and has now decided that if you could afford that, you can afford to bank roll more stuff for her.\n\n\nTime to get rid. Or at the very least, put your foot firmly down,  and ask about a repayment plan for the 1st \u00a320k", "It\u2019s not even the repayment I\u2019m concerned about honestly. Again, I really don\u2019t want to sound\u2026 rude or conceited, but we\u2019re from a small rural area where stuff isn\u2019t crazy expensive, and my job has allowed me to work in cities so I\u2019ve made good money and I also was able to telework through the pandemic. So I got to make money AND pay for my cheap house in tiny rural town. But I didn\u2019t just loan her this money for her to get back into debt :( We currently aren\u2019t talking right now but she also hasn\u2019t told me she\u2019s kicked me from the wedding. I have no idea where anything is at. I feel really bad.", "The problem is that she's *also* not concerned about repayment.\n\nSome people, when you loan them money, conclude that you don't need the money. And so they will justify to themselves not paying them back.\n\nPeople like this must be reminded of their debt constantly. They don't conceptualise a debt as its own thing. They don't see the debt as an obligation. They see the whole thing through their relationship with the loaner. If they need money and the loaner lends it to them, the money is now theirs. Calling it a loan and a debt are meaningless words. If the loaner doesn't ask it back, it's because the loaner doesn't need it and thus there's no need to pay.\n\nHaving lended money to people like this, you have to constantly remind them to pay it back. You may even have to tell them that you're strapped for cash and *need* them to pay it back. And you must tell them again and again. If, during any conversation, you don't mention needing the money back, it must be because you don't need it back and it can remain in the debtor's hands.\n\nStart reminding her. Or you'll never see that money again. And even if you don't care about the money, remind her anyway, or she'll keep thinking you have plenty and that she has no debt. Her debt to you does not exist in her mind as long as she doesn't think you need it back. Of course, that'll lose you the friendship, but is this woman's friendship worth 20k to you? Really? Pretty sure there are plenty of people who'll be your friend for free.", "I see two possible solutions, (info how long since you last spoke) give it a couple of days let the dust settle \n\nOr\n\nTalk to her about it and clear the air. \n\nRepay may not have been the correct word.\n\nHow I see it right now is she is treating it more like a gift and isn't concerned about what you loaned her the money for, or whether or not she feels an urgency to pay you back.", "NTA, I'm sorry to say that she doesn't sound like a very good friend to you. She's planning extravagant outings and things and implying that you're going to foot the bill, even after the massive loan (that you're never going to get a dime repaid) you graciously provided.", "Ohhh, story time, if you\u2019re up to it: I come from very rural south. I did the unthinkable and went to college (as opposed to settling down and having kids). And now, so very many years later I earn 4x the \u2018goal\u2019 income for our area. I won\u2019t get into why I came back, but we are moving next year. Thing is, there comes some kind of\u2026guilt, I guess? For making the choices that I\u2019m still paying for in loans, but am considered quite well off for the area. My husband and I intentionally dress very relaxed. Like Walmart relaxed. Mostly because that\u2019s who we truly are, and we\u2019ve discovered people do not assume we have money this way. And we don\u2019t, we are only now realizing how often we are taken advantage of, regularly. Big hearts and not wanting people to suffer as we did, etc. Those who contemplate our income source honestly think we are into drugs, because the real story is not easily understood. We spent a lot of time minding our own business. When I loan money, I never expect to see it again, and it seems you have taken the same attitude, congratulations for that. But it\u2019s time to tell your friend that you have plans for your money, and it wasn\u2019t for her dreams. You are absolutely being used, I have even developed a term for this \u201cNot maliciously opportunistic\u201d for the people who don\u2019t plan to take advantage, but will certainly walk through the door when you open it, and then request the red carpet too. The two things don\u2019t have to be equal, your friend doesn\u2019t have to be a bad person and taking advantage of you, she can be good, and only taking advantage where she sees the opening.", "Tell her the bank of (your name) is bankrupt and waiting for a loan repayment of 20 K !", "NTA.\n\n$20k is a *lot* of money even for an20 year old friendship. You may just be the goose that laid the golden egg for your friend. She\u2019ll not ever live within her means as long as you\u2019re there to bail her out each time. \n\nShe should have been very respectful of the funds you provided and used it responsibly for the purpose it was given. She should have determined to pay you back because she values you as much as you value her.\n\nShe\u2019s also using emotional blackmail to make you feel bad and guilt you into doing what she\u2019s asked. At some point, she stopped being the person you were best friends with. Now, you represent something else to her.", "NTA\nShe sees you as an ATM not a friend. This isn't your responsibility and you should never have lent her money in the first place. Surely she should be paying you back before she starts spending on a wedding?", "You & I both know that OP will never, ever, see a dime from this leech."]}
