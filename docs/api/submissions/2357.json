I feel really bad.", "The problem is that she's *also* not concerned about repayment.\n\nSome people, when you loan them money, conclude that you don't need the money. And so they will justify to themselves not paying them back.\n\nPeople like this must be reminded of their debt constantly. They don't conceptualise a debt as its own thing. They don't see the debt as an obligation. They see the whole thing through their relationship with the loaner. If they need money and the loaner lends it to them, the money is now theirs. Calling it a loan and a debt are meaningless words. If the loaner doesn't ask it back, it's because the loaner doesn't need it and thus there's no need to pay.\n\nHaving lended money to people like this, you have to constantly remind them to pay it back. You may even have to tell them that you're strapped for cash and *need* them to pay it back. And you must tell them again and again. If, during any conversation, you don't mention needing the money back, it must be because you don't need it back and it can remain in the debtor's hands.\n\nStart reminding her. Or you'll never see that money again. And even if you don't care about the money, remind her anyway, or she'll keep thinking you have plenty and that she has no debt. Her debt to you does not exist in her mind as long as she doesn't think you need it back. Of course, that'll lose you the friendship, but is this woman's friendship worth 20k to you? Really?

I did the unthinkable and went to college (as opposed to settling down and having kids). And now, so very many years later I earn 4x the \u2018goal\u2019 income for our area. I won\u2019t get into why I came back, but we are moving next year. Thing is, there comes some kind of\u2026guilt, I guess? For making the choices that I\u2019m still paying for in loans, but am considered quite well off for the area. My husband and I intentionally dress very relaxed. Like Walmart relaxed. Mostly because that\u2019s who we truly are, and we\u2019ve discovered people do not assume we have money this way.

Big hearts and not wanting people to suffer as we did, etc. Those who contemplate our income source honestly think we are into drugs, because the real story is not easily understood.

If she claims she can't, then tell her simply, you did not loan her 20k to get out of debt just so she can plan a OTT wedding.

He and his older sister remember finances being tight in childhood before their dad started reeling in the *big* bucks, while their younger sister wasn\u2019t around for that. Younger sis is a frivolous spender and doesn\u2019t really understand that people take advantage of generous people while my bf and older sis have a more realistic understanding of money and the risks of giving too much too soon. \n\nAll that to say, younger sis has a bad habit of spending money on other people and gifting them very fancy things because she can easily do so\u2026 And unfortunately she has continuously ended up with partners and friends who freeloaded off her. \n\nIt\u2019s reaaaaally hard to find a balance between being generous with people because you can easily help and it going well, and being overly generous/doing it in a way that people recognize they can take advantage of. \n\nIt sounds to me like this friend of yours has become too comfortable with your generosity and expects it as the default rather than seeing your help as a gesture of care and love. \n\nIf it were me, I would set some clear and firm boundaries with this friend about finances so that there is no room for miscommunication, pressuring, etc. You do not want to end up in a position where she expects you to bail her out and you cave because you feel bad about her screwing herself over. \n\nYou need to have a serious talk with her about the 20k loan and her plans for repayment, and you also need to make sure she understands that you cannot bail her out again or help her financially any further.", "NTA. Set up a meeting with her and her fiance - maybe over a lunch or somewhere public.\n\nYou are concerned about all these expensive ideas being thrown around. Explain that, while you wish them well and want them to enjoy whatever kind of celebration they end up having, you will not be financing it. Especially since she has not repaid a single cent of the 20k you lent her a year ago. \n\nYou are now somewhat annoyed that they propose to spend so much money on their event that should be going to starting to pay you back.", "NTA.  Set that boundary hard and fast.  Why on earth would OP expect to cover all the expenses for someone else's wedding?  Particularly since they weren't even asked to in advance.  OP should be prepared to be uninvited.  Bartender best friend should learn to live within her actual means instead of milking others for her lifestyle.", "NTA. Never lend money to anyone. Ever.", "NTA, probably should file a claim for that loan. It sounds like she is going to be using that or other things for her elaborate wedding.", "Hey. You're not getting that money back. Nta", "> obviously\n\nseriously, how is OP even considering they are AH here. She GAVE her friend 20k and now friend is just ignoring that and asking for more money.", "She's not planning on going into debt. She expects you to pick up the bill. For that to happen she can't kick you out of the wedding,  she will come crawling back with a sob story to get you to pay for her wedding.  Do not do it, she is using you.", "Anybody who would do this shit will never pay back a debt unless forced to.", "lol, op is never getting that money back.\n\nthis is a stop the bleeding situation at this point.", "FYI, It's possible that text is enough to be binding for court. You should follow through on that, or else you've just made a $20k mistake", "more like you bailed her out of debt.\n\nand 2 years later she is going to have 20k of debt again.", "Get her to acknowledge the debt in text/writing before extracting yourself from the wedding & take her to small claims about it", "I\u2019m no lawyer, but I\u2019ve heard of courts taking a percentage of people\u2019s paychecks when they owe someone money. Do your mutual friends know she basically just took $20k from you and is demanding more?", "you seem to understand whats going on now. Take this as a lesson learned and move on with life.\n\nIve had people like this in my life too. Guess how many of those people are still in my life?", "It sounds like you are fully understanding the scenario now and I'm sorry. She is not a friend. You deserve more. And you deserve your money to be repaid. \n\nNow that you know, make a plan, cut your losses (fake friends) and be proud of the strrlong and resilient person you are becoming.", "This is well over \"small claims\". This is grand larceny!", "NTA - You are being taken advantage of. At this point you are okay with not getting the money back, which is good because you and I both know you will never see it. But do not give her anymore. Let her know that there is no \"we\". If she doesn't have the money to pay to help out the others, that you will no be doing it. This is not you responsibility to do. If she gets mad and wants to drop you as a friend because of it, then you know that she is ungrateful, entitled, and was never a true friend in the first place", "NTA you are being used. I'm sorry. Someone as nice as you deserves better.", "NTA - you are not a bank.", "NTA you are being used.  State your boundaries clearly.  Or be quiet and pay...it is your $$", "NTA, your friend thinks of you as an ATM.", "She's taken advantage of you once, and she'll continue until you stop it. I hope you are able to get your money back. Honestly, I think you'll have to take her to court to get back the $20k. NTA", "NTA. Don't do this. She will get into debt all over again, and your her shiny purse she expects to open and find money for everything she wants. This is all on you. You will pay for everyone, and that's not what weddings are about. You all have fun doing what everyone can afford. They need to pay their own way, that's how it goes. The debt will remain long after the memories. If she has a meltdown, it may be time to grow up and let her go.", "NTA - And if she pressures you again about this, you can send her a collections letter.... with interest... for the money you have already given her. And drop this girl like a bad habit.... please! This is NOT a friend. This is a siphon of your good will and intentions.", "NTA.  Your friend is being one.  You set a reasonable boundary.  BTW, though, if you want to keep a friend you either (A) never loan them money to begin with or (B) go into the loan with accepting that you may never get it back and that might be the cost of your friendship . . . though if you experience B, I would imagine your friendship would forever change.", "OP, then you need to establish new boundaries immediately.\n\nYou need to tell bride that you will spend $X,XXX and nothing more on her wedding and you will only pay for the costs associated with your own role. That she needs to let her bridesmaids know ASAP what all of her plans will cost them because most will not be able to afford it. Tell her you are not in a position to help with additional expenses because she never paid you back the $20K you loaned her. Emphasize that the money was  a loan - not a gift - and that you two need to establish some kind of repayment plan ASAP.\n\nTruly though, unless she signed anything stating it was a loan, you basically gifted her $20K. It was $20K that will ruin this friendship since you resent it, but it was a gift since she doesn't intend to pay back the loan.", "Exactly. And if she ends the friendship she will just use that as another excuse not to pay her back. Even if she got something in writing, she's never getting the money back.", "So, I get you want to do the right thing, but you're still trying to justify her taking advantage of you IMO. Saying you don't want her to work OT or that her buying a home is more important than paying you back is you still putting her needs above yours, and especially after she's just proved to you she doesn't value your friendship, she values your wallet. It shouldn't matter what she's spending her money on, she borrowed money from you and she owes you that. Her needs are not more important than your own.", "She can use the excuse that the economy hasn't itself forever.  I'd start asking for a payment plan to get it paid back with interest, or paid in full by a certain date or you are taking her to court.  And don't spend any more money or emotional energy on this relationship.", "Chances are loaning her that money reinforced her bad habits, since she faced 0 repercussions from going into 20k+ of debt.", "Unfortunately, your kindness in helping her get out of debt just bailed her out of a situation without her learning a thing. She might have to learn this one the hard way, so please graciously back out of the wedding party, excuse yourself from any discussions about money and don't lend her any more until she presents you with a plan to repay you for your earlier BEYOND GENEROUS loan. (it does sound like you don't care so much about getting repaid, but if she thinks you do, the pressure remains on her to at least acknowledge her debt.) Good luck! NTA!", "NTA\u2026I just love how  people like to \u201cspend\u201d  someone else\u2019s money, and without even asking first, to boot.  It is customary to pay for yourself and each bridesmaid or attendee pays for the bride for the bachelorette party, but not for others.   (This is my area of the US).  The bridal shower is usually held by family.  Yes, we pay for our own dress and shoes.  Now, I come from a time where we did our own hair and make up.   I think you need to have a chat with the bride and find out what all the plans are and what she is expecting and let her know what you are willing to do and what events you can attend.   And set up a plan for repayment if your loan.  It was not a \u201cgift\u201d.   This \u201cfriendship\u201d might have run it\u2019s course and you might have to chalk up the 20 to a loss or go to court.", "NTA. Get your money back off her and bin her off, she\u2019s using you", "NTA imo never loan friends money. That doesn't mean never help a friend in need, just don't give money as a loan. Give money without the expectation it'll be paid back, even if the friend wants to pay it back. Accept the offer of repayment and if they do pay it back great, and if not then nothing has changed. \n\nOf course that means don't give money you cannot afford to never see again. Because no matter how much you trust your friend life happens in ways that are outside of your and their control.", "NTA.  Your 'friend' (and I put that in quotes because I don't see her as much of a friend to you) hasn't paid you back 20K, is planning an elaborate wedding and hoopla leading up to the wedding that she clearly can't afford, and she expects you to help pay for her and her friends expenses.  \n\nShe is using you for your money, plain and simple.  I suggest you do what I do when asked to be in a wedding.  I let the bride know I have a budget that I simply will not go over, I am willing to spend $XXX on the wedding and that has to include all expenses, not just the dress but hair/makeup, bachelorette party, bridal shower, all expenses have to land within my budget.  If bride anticipates bridesmaid expenses going over that limit, then I will gracefully step down and attend the wedding as just a guest.  I'm pretty sure your friend will freak out if you do this because she clearly expects you to pay for the majority of *HER* expenses.", "Are you her friend or ATM? I\u2019m pretty sure you two will have different answers for that.  You\u2019re NTA, but be prepared to lose the \u201cfriendship\u201d I\u2019d you don\u2019t give her more money.", "You loaned a deadbeat friend $20K?\nI couldn't read any further. Whatever you're asking about...yes, it's your fault.", "Any thoughts on waiting until the officiant says, does anyone know any reason these two should not be married, and then OP can say, cause bride is a black hole for other people\u2019s $?", "Hopefully, OP has some documentation on this.  20K is higher than a normal gift tax exemption but I'd be surprised there was a document drawn up or anything.  I would not pay a single cent for anything and I'd probably tell them to go to city hall and get married and forget this elaborate stuff or I wouldn't participate. oh and OP is NTA.", ">Capable\\_Boat\n\njust tell people your fancy car is a company car", "text messages are admissible in court \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd  best of luck", ">Capable\\_Boat\n\nplease don't let her get away with this.  talk to a lawyer and see what options you have.  You've been played and now she thinks she can do it again and have you pay for her lavish wedding.  This chick needs a wake up call", "NTA\n\nIt feels like you\u2019re being used because you are being used.", "NTA and you are being used. Get your 20k back and take a hard look at this friendship.", "NTA. If your friend is mad at you because you won't pay for her elaborate and expensive wedding, then she does not consider you her friend, she considers you her ATM.", "NTA. You\u2019re never gonna see that money and she\u2019ll drop you as moh once you can\u2019t finance her wedding stuff. Talk to a lawyer about how to prove and pursue the debt before telling her anything.", "NTA", "NTA. Wow. You\u2019re a very nice friend to loan your friend $20,000. She should be appreciate you and be more considerate for other people\u2019s finances.", "You bailed her out. She\u2019s not going to pay you back and she\u2019s not going to curb her spending. Stop enabling her and letting her dictate how you spend (or not) your money. That 20k would have done you more good putting in a 401 for retirement. No one ever thinks needing money in the future until the future is here.", "This exactly. You were made the maid of honor because she knew you could cave and pay for everything that she and her friend group couldn't afford.\n\nIt should be telling that you are MOH when you know no one and are not related. If the majority of her bridal party is other friends who know each other and not you, there has to be a reason.\n\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I would suggest she does NOT see you as her best friend like you see her as yours. If she values your friendship as much as you do hers, then clearly she wouldn't let money come between you. Tell her you will not be paying, and as a wedding gift you only expect back 19,000 and she can keep the very generous 1,000 as a gift. Let her know you would need it back as 500 bucks a month every month starting now, but that you will let her skip out on her wedding month. See her response and judge accordingly how much of a 'friend' she is.", "If your friendship is entirely contingent on whether or not you will continue to support the other person financially, then it's not a true friendship at all.  Your feelings are correct when you say you feel like you are being used."]}
