I feel really bad.", "The problem is that she's *also* not concerned about repayment.\n\nSome people, when you loan them money, conclude that you don't need the money. And so they will justify to themselves not paying them back.\n\nPeople like this must be reminded of their debt constantly. They don't conceptualise a debt as its own thing. They don't see the debt as an obligation. They see the whole thing through their relationship with the loaner. If they need money and the loaner lends it to them, the money is now theirs. Calling it a loan and a debt are meaningless words. If the loaner doesn't ask it back, it's because the loaner doesn't need it and thus there's no need to pay.\n\nHaving lended money to people like this, you have to constantly remind them to pay it back. You may even have to tell them that you're strapped for cash and *need* them to pay it back. And you must tell them again and again. If, during any conversation, you don't mention needing the money back, it must be because you don't need it back and it can remain in the debtor's hands.\n\nStart reminding her. Or you'll never see that money again. And even if you don't care about the money, remind her anyway, or she'll keep thinking you have plenty and that she has no debt. Her debt to you does not exist in her mind as long as she doesn't think you need it back. Of course, that'll lose you the friendship, but is this woman's friendship worth 20k to you? Really?

I did the unthinkable and went to college (as opposed to settling down and having kids). And now, so very many years later I earn 4x the \u2018goal\u2019 income for our area. I won\u2019t get into why I came back, but we are moving next year. Thing is, there comes some kind of\u2026guilt, I guess? For making the choices that I\u2019m still paying for in loans, but am considered quite well off for the area. My husband and I intentionally dress very relaxed. Like Walmart relaxed. Mostly because that\u2019s who we truly are, and we\u2019ve discovered people do not assume we have money this way.

Big hearts and not wanting people to suffer as we did, etc. Those who contemplate our income source honestly think we are into drugs, because the real story is not easily understood.

She hasn't paid you a penny back and is planning a wedding *way* beyond her budget... expecting you to cover everyone's costs.\n\nTell her you won't be paying anything till she starts remaking payments. If she claims she can't, then tell her simply, you did not loan her 20k to get out of debt just so she can plan a OTT wedding. The money was to help her out of the financial hole Covid created for her, not to be able to once again max out her credit/fall behind on bills etc.", "NTA. You are being used.  She has champagne taste on a beer budget. This might naturally sort itself out if you stand back and let her other friends say that they can't afford it.  she needs a reality check. a wedding is 1 day - why does it entail multiple overnight trips? Personally, I'd back out.", "Say it in a group chat or in front of friends. Be polite and regretful about it. It will stop the friends making the same mistake and prevent the leech retaliating with lies. And maybe the friend will realise she should pay it back. \n\nProbably not but hold the line, save the others from giving her no strings money etc \n\nIt's almost definitely not coming back but being nice about just hedges those vets and gives the friend a chance to step up.", "You are getting taken advantage of by a \u201cfriend\u201d. She thinks she\u2019s entitled to YOUR money. If she can\u2019t afford to have a wedding she doesn\u2019t need to have one. They can just go down to the courthouse and get married. Unless you sue her to get that money back, your money is gone forever.", "Honestly I wouldn't be concerned about the wedding, I'd be concerned about her repaying you. Ultimately you can't dictate or decide where she spends the money but she needs to repay you. Gather up evidence and take her to small claims court.", "From an objective viewpoint, this sounds like a very lopsided friendship. You did your friend a favor, one that most people would consider a pretty huge favor...this one just happens to involve money. Your friend, rather than being grateful and trying her hardest to pay you back, or at least acknowledging that she owes you (or at the very least using it for its intended purpose of helping to dig herself out of debt), is basically pretending it never happened.\n\nNow she's offering up more of your money for her wedding plans, acting like it's a given, and then getting upset when you very reasonably say no (it would have been very reasonable even without the previous loan \\[which, I'm sorry to say, I'm pretty sure she doesn't consider a loan\\]). You have allll the reasons to be the upset party here, yet you're the one feeling guilty and she's the one who's angry, for some reason? It sounds like you're worried that your actions might damage this friendship when it should absolutely be the other way around.\n\nIn short, you sound like you're her friend much more than she sounds like she's yours. I'm sorry. I hope that's not the case, but from what you've described, you deserve better than this friend.", "Nta. You need to be concerned about repayment and especially now. Remind her that you expect it and if you have texts and receipts of everything let her know you'll take her to court. She obviously was using you and now that you are of no use she booted you.", "Sorry  Capable, whilst the reason you did our honourable, I very much doubt hers are.\n\nYou have given the money to help a friend get out of debt, I assume she has duped what she thinks of as a mug with too much money, so she will have cash to spend. I have no doubt the credit cards will be maxed out again soon enough.", "You should be concerned about repayment.  You are enabling her! Your friend is going to be in debt all her life and her husband too.  I'd get a repayment plan.", "OP is never getting that money back.", "Yup. This is why OP's NTA", "\"Anyway, she\u2019s been planning a rather (IMO) elaborate\u2026 everything for the wedding, which is fine.\"\n\nShe owes you 20K. That's not fine unless the parents are paying for it.\n\n\"But I asked how everyone was going to pay for these things and she said it wouldn\u2019t be an issue and \u201cwe\u201d could help them out\"\n\nShe means you. \n\nYou are being used OP.  What does her fianc\u00e9 think about the debt she owes you? When their married, that debt is also going to affect him. My guess is she has NO plans to pay you back.  Cut your losses.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI'm so baffled by this... like if you don't have the means to throw an expensive wedding then don't inconvenience other people to cop out the cash you need just to satisfy your own depravity. \n\nThis is not a friend who respects you OP.  Maybe its time to take a step back.", "NTA. But this is why you should never loan money to \"friends\".  She's going to be a perpetually poor mooch her entire life and you are out 20k.  But she will probably tell everyone after the friendship ends that you are the one that owes her money...", "NTA. A good life advice is to never lend money you aren\u2019t ready to lose because um you aren\u2019t getting that $20K back.", "NTA. You are obviously being used. Please see it.", "NTA\n\nYou might be shit out of luck ever getting that money back. \n\nRegardless - don\u2019t lend people money who already owe you money. Do NOT contribute a dollar towards her wedding. \n\nIf you ever see that money again? Don\u2019t loan her money ever again.", "NTA. And I imagine when you stop giving her money she will drop you as a friend", "NTA it\u2019s ok to not let other people spend your money. I\u2019m sure she will do a shocked pikachu face because she thinks she is entitled to your money as you are sharing in her big day. Brides has significant delusions of grandeur on this thread. So nothing is surprising and you do need to be that blunt", "NTA, you're definitely bring used. Who plans for a wedding with someone else's money when they already have a hefty debt to pay? I would run, op. I'm sorry!", "NTA+ I am sorry but you lost $20k unless you are willing to sue. She is only friends with you for money. Back out of the wedding and her life.", "NTA. But never lend money to someone who \u201cspends frivolously\u201d as you put it. You will never see a dime of that money again. \n\nShe\u2019s also clearly taking advantage of you. I\u2019m sure you can see where you\u2019re 20k went.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine borrowing $20,000 from a so-called friend and then planning a wedding that I didn\u2019t want them to put more money towards without even bothering to pay them back what I owe", "NTA.", "NTA. Lady, you're 100% being used. And you say if you hadn't loaned her the money you'd cover the cost? WTF. I think you need some help learning how to firmly say no.", "NTA, and step down from the wedding. If she can afford a lavish do she can afford to pay you back. Get your money. She is not your friend. You are her ATM.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole but you got to real your friend in. Someone who lives in debt or payday to payday will always live payday to payday in some capacity. Some people just always live beyond their means. So you can\u2019t be surprised when she is right back in the same situation she was in before. I would suggest saying something like. Hey I love you, you\u2019re my girl but I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m being taken advantage of. Can we set up a payment plan, even if it\u2019s $25/week for the 20k so that I don\u2019t feel like I was taken and we can discuss a completely separate budget for what\u2019s appropriate for the wedding. It sounds like the actual money isn\u2019t a huge issue for you, it\u2019s feeling like you are being taken advantage of. So work on that part of it.", "You made a nice $25k gift to your former friend.  NTA", "NTA but a friend was in a similar predicament. He didn't give a gift but subtracted from what they owe. He also didn't pay for any parties so they just didn't invite him. Never got the rest of the money back.", "NTA.  Your friend with zero debt sees a $20k hole to fill.  If you paid off that $20k, she'd fill it again.  She's assuming you'll \"help\" her again if she needs it.  It really sucks.", "You ARE being used (if you allow it). \n\nNTA", "NTA. But you're never going to see this money again. Unless you have something down on paper. Your first red flag was that's she frivolous.  You already knew she was bad with money. That was your bad decision and you'll have to accept that. \n\nNever loan money to friends and family if you need or expect it to be paid back. That is hard rule ppl. Money destroys relationships.  If you can't afford to give it, don't.", "NTA - this woman isn't your friend.  You are are finance.", "NTA. You have gone way beyond normal assistance already, any more money to her and you are just enabling her irresponsible spending habits. BTW, I read that the more money spent on the wedding, the shorter the marriage lasts.", "NTA\n\nYou're not being seen as a best friend, or even a friend OP.\n\nYou're being seen and treated as a walking, talking credit card. I wouldn't be surprised if your \"friend\" has made all of her wedding plans with your funds in her mind.", "I was going to say, she sees the OP as an ATM. She may also love the OP, but somewhere along the line, has decided that OP loves nothing more than to be the benevolent bankroller of her life, with no expectations in return. \n\nOP, you\u2019re very fortunate to be able to loan $20k without any panic about getting it back, but tough times are only getting tougher. I think you very foolish to write off that kind of money without any forethought of how you yourself may need it desperately one day. You have no idea what your circumstances may be six months from now. I\u2019d be furious with you if I was your big sister. You need\nto learn to put yourself and your own security first. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even buy this grifter a wedding gift, let alone pay a cent towards her ridiculous wedding plans. Sounds like the money you gave her was frittered away too\u2026 Time she learnt to cut her cloth.", "Ugh I needed to hear this story. My story is similar too. I didn\u2019t leave the area, but I went into a really good field and I sometimes work in cities that I make bank in. And as I\u2019m sure you know\u2026 a LOT of people don\u2019t leave rural area.\n\nAlso though, I\u2019m not going to lie, I have a really nice car that is worth more than a lot of people\u2019s houses here. If I\u2019m going to be driving six hours one way for work, I\u2019m sorry, I want to be comfortable. I also have a totally regular car, but I do have a luxury car that I can\u2019t hide. But other than that, you\u2019d never guess I make a ton by looking at me. No fancy purses or nails or clothing here lol.\n\nI LOVE that door analogy. I\u2019m taking a screenshot of it and saving it because I think that\u2019s something I need to see regularly. I\u2019ve helped a lot of people out, some pay me back, some don\u2019t, but my goal is just to see people succeed. That\u2019s really what I want.", "she might be YOUR best friend but you definitely arent hers, you\u2019re just her piggy bank. A \u201cbest friend\u201d does not ice you out cuz you cant/wont bankroll them beyond their means. She was supposed to use that money to get out of debt but it sounds like she has no plans to get out and you just gave her a buffer", "You are being used, get it in text that she still owes you money. And have a repayment plan set up. And if she doesn\u2019t follow through, go to court.\n\nShe isn\u2019t a friend. She is a user. Friends don\u2019t feel entitled to their friends money. Nor does their friendship come with conditions or expectations.\n\nNTA. But start taking the steps to recoup your $20k", "Let me guess, this isn't the first time you're loaning her money? \nBy not worrying about the money, you're enabling her frivoulous behavior. Cause she knows you're not concerned about the money aka it's not a big deal if she doesn't give it back to you. Aka she can ask again. \n\nAsk her when is she planning to give you back the money and to set a reimbursement plan.", "Regardless of where you're from and what kind of work you guys have access to, it doesn't negate the fact that your \"friend\" owes you money. She is 100% using your kindness and taking advantage of you. She has no intention of paying you back, and something tells me that's why she asked you to be MOH and hasn't kicked you out of the wedding party. You need to get your affairs in your order, otherwise you're never seeing that money ever again.", "You feel like you're being us2d because you are. Sorry- she is not a friend to you. Pay for nothing further and tell her she needs to make arrangements to pay you back. You should be angry!", "There is no actual legal documentation besides text messages of her saying she would pay me back. Her fianc\u00e9 does know about the loan and I actually have a message from her saying something along the lines of \u201che would never loan me or anyone else that much money\u201d. Smart guy haha.\n\nI genuinely just wanted her to get her life back together because I know how much the pandemic messed everyone up. \n\nYes, I WOULD like to be paid back, but not at her needing to work significant OT or affecting her quality of life. If it meant her and her fianc\u00e9 being able to buy a home together over me being paid back, I\u2019d rather them do that first, then get to me. But if it\u2019s just her spending money on stupid shit like vacation getaways and expensive nails and handbags, I\u2019d like to be paid back. I didn\u2019t mention any of this in the post but now that I\u2019ve re-read those texts, it was basically like\u2026 \u201cI will loan you this money if you do xyz to get your life together and not get yourself in frivolous debt again and pay me back when the pandemic/economy fixes itself\u201d", "I don\u2019t have much of a choice l, do I lol. To me, it seems like the friendship is toast. After re-reading this post this morning and everyone\u2019s comments, I feel uncomfortable continuing on with the friendship.\n\nAs for the money, I guess I can pursue it legally, but I think you and I, and everyone else commenting, knows she won\u2019t be able to pay it back. So I think I just earned myself an degree in \u201cMaintaining Friendship\u201d", "Maybe she's marrying up, husbands can help her pay back?", "Then the husband should pay for all of the wedding expenses! I don't care if it's traditional or not to have the groom pay for the bachelorette weekend.", "Oh I think we're ways past OP paying up for the parties. Now it's a question of is hubby the path for OP to recover the debt owed.", "I mean, why exactly is the husband on the hook? If the bride wants to have a party she can have it on her own dime.", "Oh, I thought we were assuming she\u2019d never do that, or possibly never be able to do that. I mean, if she can and will, absolutely, she should pay."]}
