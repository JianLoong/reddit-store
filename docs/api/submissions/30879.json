You\u2019re making a difficult choice to ensure they have that stability.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like she\u2019s struggling with substance abuse or mental health issues. Do whatever you can to support her getting better because your children need their mother as long as she can be a healthy person in their lives. Try not to speak negatively about her to them.

It's irrelevant that you are financially independent, she's still the mother and most men would be hauled into court asap if roles were reversed. The mother needs to grow up.

Any time a parent doesn't see their kids it's horrible. But the reason she isn't seeing them isn't due to anything you are doing. It's her decisions that are causing issues.

You're looking out for your kids, you're doing the right thing.  Also, unless she gets caught up on the child support, she shouldn't have any access anyway.", "NTA", "If she\u2019s this unstable, please alert their schools and aftercare that she does but have the right to do pick ups or withdraw them. This is very important.", "She does have substance abuse problems, and have gone bankrupt trying to help her, thus why I had to leave and take my kids out of that environment. And I never have said a bad word about my ex to my kids, because I just wouldn\u2019t feel right about it.

And become anxious when their mother comes around, as it is randomly.", "I would say that the first year she barely saw them, it frustrated the hell out of me. People would tell me \u201cleave her alone, don\u2019t make a big deal, she\u2019s going through a hard time\u201d. And at first I was like okay, but then I was like \u201cif that was me, people would be saying what a deadbeat, piss poor excuse for a man\u201d. I usually wouldn\u2019t care what people say, but today just really frustrated me. I just felt like blowing up, but maintained my bearing and took my kids for some ice cream and tried to relax. I just feel like people have so mich pitty for her, that they are just like \u201csuck it up\u201d, which I do. However, sometimes I do get angry and still get the whole \u201cjust suck it up\u201d\ud83d\ude24", "I have been through this and it\u2019s really tough. The circus that surrounds someone in active addiction is overwhelming and stressful. It\u2019s also something you have to protect your children from. You can control the stories she\u2019s going to tell about you. Those stories she\u2019s telling stem from the shame she carries, but is unable to face about the ways she is falling short as a parent. The people who love you and deserve a place in your lives will know the truth and support you. \n\nThe best thing you can do for yourself is find a local Al anon group (or something similar). You need to find a support system with people who are going through or have gone through similar circumstances.", "My ex hasn\u2019t seen the kids in almost a year. But he does pay child support. I don\u2019t need it, so I put it in an interest bearing account for their future. I will give it all to them when they head to college/start their adult lives.", "Personally I wouldn't. $100 isn't much of anything (if you don't desperately need it) and if she *is* paying it she may decide to be more present in the kid's lives.\n\nIf she's so flippant and having drug issues an absent mother is probably better than a present one.", "I know it isn\u2019t much, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t pursue it initially. I can\u2019t justify making a big deal about it, but I don\u2019t want to deal with any drama, as I\u2019m too busy with my kids and just have let it go. But when I say I strongly consider it, it\u2019s usually when I hear things like \u201cshe\u2019s on vacation, she\u2019s doing this or that\u201d but can\u2019t send $100 for her kids? I wouldn\u2019t even use the money, I would just deposit it into an IRA or some sort of savings account for the kids.", "There is that, is saving the $100 from being wasted.  But if she doesn\u2019t have a job how would you get it?  She\u2019s probably just mooching"]}
