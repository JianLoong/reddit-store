Luckily she found a different job before she got fired again.\n\nShe enjoyed her new part time job and then she increased her hours and she started complaining about it and getting anxiety around it.

She claims it's the specific jobs causing anxiety. \n\nShe's now finished university and working full time.

I pointed out its a recurring problem and she should talk to someone about it because it can't keep happening.\n\nShe accused me of only caring about money but I just pointed out she seems to be using me as a safety net to keep calling in sick and still getting the bills paid. She said she can't help her anxiety which I agreed with but I mentioned that she can help what she does about it.\n\nShe said I was being unsupportive and that I should be willing to help her.

If she was treating her anxiety and still not managing, that would be a different discussion.  She\u2019s refusing to treat her issues but demanding you make up the difference anyway.  When a person has mental illness, it isn\u2019t their fault, but managing it is their responsibility.  Your partner seems to think that sentence stops at the end of the first clause.", "NTA\n\nYou recognized the pattern of her behaviour and made efforts to end it. You\u2019re right - you are a safety net for her to continue to avoid her problems. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re paying the bills, she can let her anxiety continue to ruin her employment with no consequences. She\u2019s making no effort to finding a solution by speaking with a therapist. \n\nIt may be \u2018tough love\u2019, but it\u2019s the right move.", "NTA \n\nWhat\u2019s her plan? How does she intend to make this situation stop?\n\nI would also be fine covering if I saw there was something in place to prevent it happening again. But her refusal to see a doctor or get help just means this will keep happening. You\u2019re just waiting for the next time for it to happen.", "NTA\n\nIf she refuses to get help for what might be a genuine mental health issue then I'd say you are entitled to question her. On the other hand you live in the UK so getting help for it will take months if not years. \n\n> She claims it's the specific jobs causing anxiety.\n\nOnce is fine, twice is not great, three times is bad, FOUR times is just a trend at that point.", "You're not obligated to cover the expenses of another adult.\n\nI agree with what others have said, it sounds likes she is using you as a safety net to avoid having to deal with her anxiety.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The truth is, having you as a back up is likely enabling her laziness towards finding a way to manage her anxiety so she can keep up a job. What would she do if you decided that work is affecting your mental health just as badly, would she step up to help you out? It sounds like that's unlikely, so it's not your responsibility to do so now.\n\nMaybe you could suggest she cuts down her hours from full-time to 4 days a week, not a massive pay cut but it would give her that extra day to decompress?", "NTA. Your argumentation is very reasonable. You supported her for quite some time already, but at some point it's not a fair partnership anymore. As you said yourself, she's taking advantage of you being her safety net! \n\nIf she doesn't agree to get actual help, the problem is apparently not bad enough in her eyes, in which case I think she might as well get her butt to work fulltime.", "Nta. If she has issues with anxiety she needs to see a therapist. It looks more like she is weaponizing it.", "She doesn't know if she can't help her anxiety because she's clearly never tried to help it. \n\nYou have been more then supportive but you cannot keep carrying her. For her to try and gaslight you like this is pretty low. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You said she was going for a master's degree, but somehow college didn't cause the anxiety?", "NTA\nIt is her job to manage her anxiety. She is the one refusing. That doesn\u2019t give her a free pass for you to pay the bills for her.", " NTA - seems to me she\u2019s using you for your financial support. I get a partner should be supportive but theyre not their to cover your bills perpetually because you dont want to work.", "You are trying to help her by suggesting seeing a professional. You\u2019ve also helped her numerous times. I think it\u2019s exactly as you describe. You are her safety blanket. Which is nice to some degree until she becomes dependable, which sounds like what\u2019s happening. I feel for her as anxiety is tough to live with. But she is the common denominator in all of this. She must seek professional help in order to take control of her life. Right now it\u2019s her beliefs and triggers that are controlling her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your responsibility at all to financially support her, but we do pick up the slack in relationships as a team effort sometimes, especially when you\u2019re living together etc. But she needs to be a team player here too. If you do continue to support her financially, make it contingent that she gets professional help. And consider giving it a time limit with a check-in after said time limit so you\u2019re not indefinitely paying the majority of the bills.", "NTA she needs to find a way of working and coping with her anxiety. I have crippling anxiety some weeks which stops me leaving the house and struggle to people (legit ordering shopping to the door instead of walking 5 minutes to Lidil). Which is why I have a job where I have the option to work from home and don't have to talk to anyone, I live alone, no safety net, I HAVE to do this, she needs to find a job that she can handle. \nDo have to ask though, if she wasn't living with you would she be with her parents or living independently?", "NTA. You have accommodated her when she asked you previously, but as you said, there is a deeper issue here and she needs to address that. I would not be ok to fund her life unless she addressed the underlying issues.", "Something I should have put in the post is that she is on antidepressants but refuses to go to the doctors to look at possible changing them or changing the dose since they don't seem to be working", "NTA. Everything this person has said.", "If the only way she has tried dealing with it isn\u2019t effective and she\u2019s not willing to try anything else, everything I said still applies.\n\nIt took me 7 tries to find the right medication to manage my bipolar, and medication was only part of the treatment.  I needed therapy to learn to manage the anxiety, anger, and depression that my mental illness brings.\n\nIt would be completely reasonable and fair to say that you\u2019re willing to pay more for whatever amount of time, but only on the condition that she starts therapy and sees a psychiatrist about adjusting or changing her medication.  That would give her breathing room to get help while also holding her responsible for seeking treatment and trying to get better.", "Since your in the U.K. look at access to work it is gov funded scheme for mental health issues to help you stay in work and can put you in touch with therapists to help manage anxiety , she also needs to look at occupational health in the workplace as they can also help if she lets them know the problems . Staying silent isn\u2019t helping anyone and yes anxiety disorder sucks but if she isn\u2019t doing stuff to proactively help herself then she can\u2019t expect you to be the safety net .", "That's not trying to manage and seek aid though. I've been on antidepressants meds since I was fifteen and had to switch medications three times in two years and dose sizes five times within one year. Mental health is constant maintenance and if she's not doing that, you're NTA for telling her no at all. She can't use it as a crutch like that - it isn't fair to either of you.", "Being on a medication that\u2019s clearly not working is just as bad as not being on anything. She\u2019s not addressing the problem. And it\u2019s clearly not the medication if it\u2019s only manifesting after a few months of every new job. \n\nYou can love her to the moon and back but you\u2019ll never be a true partnership like this. Stop enabling her, and make her get the help she needs. If she refuses, then you need to look after yourself too. You deserve someone willing to be their best alongside you"]}
