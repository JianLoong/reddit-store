{"id": 26242, "submission_id": "16agw37", "title": "AITA for not wanting to take my mother's friend with cancer on a trip with us", "selftext": "So I am a doctor (oncologist) in my 30s. My mother's best friend (55F) got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer few months ago and I set her up with my colleague who specializes in pancreatic cancer and got her every possible care/advantage (early PET appointment, CTs, MRs, etc.) I was able to pull. \n\nNow every time I go visit my mother and she is there (which is quite often), she basically grabs me and wants to speak about her diagnosis, about her chemo, if there is something else I could do for her like irradiation or surgery and what do I think about it. Sometimes, it takes hours. When she was freshly diagnosed, I was there for her to talk, but it s starting to be a little too much. \nThis weekend was my father's 60th birthday and she was there. She sat next to me and kept talking and asking questions for about an hour. I excused myself and went to talk to somebody else but she kept following me and asking more questions even though I told her I don't have answers for her and I cannot give my opinion since I am not her doctor. It continued until I left, and I must say it really spoiled the party for me a little. \nWell, for my mother's birthday I got a trip to Paris for her and me for 2 weeks and when I told her, she asked if we could take her friend with us. I told her that if she wants to take her friend with her, I will withdraw myself because I don't really wanna go with her friend. She can easily go because she has chemo every two weeks, so we would just have to go around her schedule. But I want to enjoy it with my mum and I am afraid I won't be able to be with her friend there. I offered to give my spot to her friend and that they could go together, but I knew my mum would refuse since she does not speak English nor French and is afraid of traveling without me. She told me that as a doctor, I should be able to understand and give her nice, possibly last vacation, and we had an argument afterward. \n\nSo redit AITA?\n\nEdit: I am female :)", "created_utc": 1693896980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16agw37/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_mothers_friend/", "score": 426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set a clear boundary when saying you can't give your opinion and she ignored it.", "You have been very kind in helping your mothers friend but you are entitled to your time off. If this woman is at every family gathering harassing you I completely see how that would be overbearing. And nothing you can say or do will ease her mind regardless. Reiterate to your mom that you bought these tickets to spend quality family time with her alone. Her friends condition is a reminder that life is finite. And time with family is very valuable. Maybe she can go on another trip closer to home with her friend, or somewhere they would be more comforfable just the two of them.", "NTA. You can't allow yourself to be in this situation. You've done more than enough already.", "NTA.\n\nStick to your guns. While I'm sympathetic to her condition (I've had relatives passing away due to cancer and cancer survivors too in my family) and it sucks to be in her position, you don't owe all your time talking about her and her disease. Even if you are her doctor, outside of consulting hours you aren't obligated to answer anything.\n\nOnce your mother calms down, talk to her calmly. Tell her gently that \"Mom, it's not that I don't care for your friend. If I didn't, I wouldn't have recommended her to oone of the best doctors that I knew. I am glad that you're thinking so much about emotional well-being of your friend. But at the same time, please put yourself in my shoes. As much as it is draining for the patients like her, I'm equally drained too. Day in and day out I care for so many patients. Most of the times, I even deal with giving them tough diagnosis that they might not make it even with chemo and other therapies. Although I know it is inevitable, it still hurts to see that they don't make it. That's why I've been meaning to go on a trip with you. I wish to relax in your company. Feel the hope that there's life. If your friend were to accompany, I'd be forced to face the same truths that I deal daily. I wouldn't be able to relax and rejuvenate. It's highly important that I'm mentally strong so that I can be there for my patients.\n\nIf you wish to make the trip memorable for your friend, feel free to let her take my spot. Enjoy with her. If language is the issue, change the destination so that both of you will be comfortable. I am ready to go on a different trip with you. But please don't insist that I should accompany with your friend. Vacation trips are meant to be relaxing. With your friend around, I won't be able to. I am not even exaggerating. I couldn't even enjoy dad's birthday party. I didn't even get a break of 5 mins to enjoy myself- thanks to her never ending questions. Heck I can't even answer majority of them because I'm not even her doctor. I am sorry. Please understand\".", "Cancer patient here, but I would not dream of exploiting a friendship and doing what your mum's friend is doing.\n\nFirstly, you need to draw firmer boundaries with your mum's friend. Politely, but firmly. Just keep saying things like \"Muriel, you're not my patient. I can't answer that\". \"Muriel, these are questions for your oncologist, not me\". \"No, Muriel, I can't comment on that, not even off the record. I would be in breach of the ethical and legal code of my profession.\" \"Muriel, I understand this is scary and you need someone to talk to, but I can't be that person.\" \"No, Muriel, I'm not available for that conversation.\" \"Muriel, **you need to stop asking.**\"\n\nKeep saying it like a stuck record. If she never gets any answers from you, I think she will eventually give up - although it may take some time.\n\nSecondly, the trip. I presume your offer to have your mum's friend go with her (and withdraw yourself) means that you would be the one paying for her friend? If so, that was an extremely generous offer. You've gone above and beyond what any reasonable person could expect of you, so don't let your mother guilt you on the fact that you would withdraw if her friend goes.\n\nIt's sad that the friend has a particularly nasty cancer which may end up being terminal. But that is not your fault, and you are not required to spend time with a person whose company you do not enjoy, and who is likely to keep pushing your boundaries harder than she already has been because you're effectively trapped with her for two weeks.\n\nHave you actually told your mother **why** you don't want to spend two weeks with her friend? - i.e. the reasons you told us here?\n\nMy surviving parent is a very social person and has lots of friends, some of whom I like very much, but some of whom are a pain in the ass. I've actually told my parent, in relation to a couple of them: if you're planning to invite Edna or Marvin over for lunch or a coffee or whatever, can you please give me a heads up? - so I can visit you on a day when they're not there. And I explained to my parent: I'm glad you like them and their friendship is valuable to you, but I'm sorry, they just rub me the wrong way, and the feeling is probably mutual, so it's best if I'm not around them. My parent was not offended at all, as far as I know. And there's no way in the world I would agree to two weeks in the company of a person I do not like. I had to do that growing up, with one of my sisters, whom I loathe. No way am I doing it with a parent's friend, especially if I'm the one paying.\n\nI have an alternative suggestion. You said your mum does not want to travel to Paris without you because she speaks neither English nor French. OK, then. If you're in a generous mood, why not offer to send your mother and her friend on a short trip to a place where they **do** speak the language? For instance, somewhere in their own country that they particularly love, or have always wanted to visit? Then you could save the Paris trip with your mum for some later date. That way, you still get a trip alone with your mum later on, her friend gets a trip with your mum now which may end up being her last, and you get to look like the generous benefactor.\n\nEdited to add a judgment: NTA.", "NTA - You are not her doctor and not required to talk to her about her illness for hours whenever she feels like it.

However it\u2019s your mother\u2019s birthday and maybe just gently explain that you wanted it to be just the two of you.", "NTA. How is it that your mother doesn't see how incredibly inappropriate this situation is? She shouldn't be allowing her friend to accost you on your personal time, especially given you're not her doctor, nor does it sound like you specialize in her particular cancer.", "Nta \n\nTell your mom as a dr you have certain rules. One of them is not to interfere. \n\nKeep the details of the trip to your self. Tell your mom no this is just a you and her trip. If she wants the friend to go they can go.\n\n\nAlso tell your mom that she need to explain to her friend your not her free medical advice. You will no longer show up or be around her friend as it is inappropriate and could ruin your career", "NTA - She is abusing your services and experience.  \n\n\nYou should simply tell her \"I cannot talk to you about this anymore.\"  eVery time she brings it up, say the same thing.  Over and over until she gets the hint.  Maybe get others to repeat it to her.", "While I understand WHY she's doing it, it doesn't make the right thing to do asking you questions.  I would just tell her, every single time she asks a question, refer her back to her current oncologist.  Tell her you haven't followed her case and you wouldn't want to give her incorrect information.  That or get her insurance information and bill her everytime she asks you a question.  One or the other will end the questions.  NTAH, I can't imagine how awful your vacation would be if she went.", "NTA.\n\nStart charging her for consultations.", "NTA. That would be two weeks solid of what you have been experiencing at your parents' house, not a nice trip with your mom.", "NTA but you need to be upfront with your mom and her friend that it is a professional conflict of interest to provide opinions about her health care, and that if they broach the topic you will walk away.

So she can be there and pester you with questions", "NTA, tell your mom that her friend is overstepping, and if that doesn't stop it tell the friend that while you are a Dr., you are not her doctor and you are visiting your mom and to stop.

We need to reconnect without your friend.  If you feel that your friend having a \"nice possibly last vacation\" is more important then us reconnecting, then I will take her and you can stay home.  Or as I previously offered, you two can go on vacation together.  The three of us going on vacation is not good for me.", "NTA. Her friend needs to learn boundaries.

Your mother has engineered a situation in which someone is going to get hurt no matter what; set your boundary and accept that everyone here is responsible for dealing with their own feelings.", "You need to be really blunt with both your mum and her friend. \n\nFor your mum: \"Mum, I'm sorry that Muriel has cancer, but I cannot continue to have her harassing me, and that is what she is doing. Every single day, I look after cancer patients, and Muriel is now trying to make me work as her doctor in my free time. She has a doctor, an excellent one that I recommended. I have told her to stop, but her behaviour is getting worse. She spent all of dad's birthday chasing me around his party, asking me questions. \n\nShe is asking me to jeopardise my job and my reputation, not to mention my relationship with her doctor, by trying to force me to treat her, and she is asking me to do this in my spare time. I will not subject myself to a vacation of her forcing me to be her personal, on-call doctor when I am supposed to be on vacation, enjoying time with my mother. She already ruined Dad's birthday for me and is ensuring I cannot spend quality time with you when she is around, but I will not pay to go away so that I can once again be treated like her personal doctor. You want me to understand her, but you are failing to understand that she is hurting and exhausting me with this. Can you imagine if she insisted you do your job even on your days off, even at our family events, all the time? Imagine if she did not give you a single break. That's what she's doing even though she has a doctor of her own to ask questions of.\"\n\nFor Muriel: \"I understand that cancer and treatment are scary. I understand that you are worried, scared, and stressed and want the best treatment possible. That is why I referred you to an expert on your cancer. \n\nNow I am going to say this one final time: I am not your personal doctor. I am not treating you. I will not be treating you. I have a lot of my own patients, and I will not jeopardise my job, my reputation, and my professional relationship with your doctor because you refuse to accept my boundaries. \n\nThis means that when you have questions, you take them to your doctor. I will not be reviewing your medical records. I will not be spending my days off and my time with my family being treated like your on-call doctor. How did you think it was acceptable to chase me around my Dad's birthday party asking me questions? Would you be okay with me stopping you from speaking with your family and forcing you to work during your family events? \n\nI am sorry if this seems harsh, but I have repeatedly tried to say no to you, and you have constantly overriden my wishes. I love being a doctor, but in my spare time, I would just like to be me and enjoy my time with my family.\"\n\nAnd if she continues, turn around and leave. If words will not get through to her, let your actions speak. She hands you her medical records? Hand them back and walk away. She tried asking questions? Say, \"I'm sorry, but we've discussed that I will not be discussing your case with you,\" and walk away. Every time you give in and keep engaging, you're giving tacit permission for her to carry on. You've been more than gracious with her, but you need to put your foot down. Also, let your mother know that you will visit her when Muriel isn't there. If Muriel shows up, you will leave the moment she starts trying to get you to give her a free, multiple-hour long consultation.", "Nta.The next time she brings you her medical records just tell her before not today. That you would like to enjoy the party or whatever event you are at. That she's welcome to discuss things with her doctor but you can't really help her anymore.\n\nOr you can start telling your mom your not going but still show up as a nice surprise so that way her friend doesn't bring her paper work with you. \n\nDon't feel bad you have gone above and beyond to help your moms friend out but she needs to let you enjoy being with your family at these events because your not a doctor when you visit. you're just their adult child there trying to enjoy quality time with family.\n\nIt's fine that she has alot of questions but she needs to talk to her doctor because you don't have all the answers for her and  like you said even looking at her records could get you introuble so maybe stop answering her questions cause she could run back and tell her doctors that you said this and that and you might get introuble. So it's best to tell her no.\n\nYou also don't owe Muriel a vacation just because your a doctor and she going through something. You deserve to spend time alone with your mom. If your mom doesn't want to go with Muriel then cancel the trip and get her a small gift. You go to Paris and bring your mom a nice gift back.", "I'm assuming you're in the UK because you use the word Mum and you're talking about Paris as a quick trip. If so, the GMC completely has your back here (I used to work for them and I know doctors don't usually think that's the case). But we would always advise doctors to use the GMC's guidance to get yourself out of situations like these. The guidance says that you SHOULD NOT be treating friends and family because it's difficult to remain objective. You MUST NOT access data records for people who aren't your patients because that's a whole big messy can of worms. Wave a copy of Good Medical Practice in her face and tell her you risk being reported to the GMC if you do the things she's pressuring you to do. Absolutely blame it all on the GMC because it's their job to provide you with the guidance on how to behave in these situations.", "In your place I'd really be tempted to turn passive-aggressive and start with some of the classic comebacks for this situation.\n\nFor instance: \"I should give you a check-up right now, Muriel. Please undress... What, you don't want to undress in the middle of the party? Then save it for office hours\".", "I would suggest just getting up and leaving if saying it 2x doesn't get her to stop. If your parents ask tell them you asked bthe friend politely you said you cannot help her as you are not her doctor and you are done with being harassed.", "Well of course, she's got you to answer every question and be a shoulder to cry on! /S\nDr, what happens if my eyes roll any further back in my head? Will they stay like that forever like grandma said?", "She's dealing with her illness by acting like you're a miracle worker who has all of the answers.\n\nI understand she's scared. But something's gotta give before you get asked one question too many, and end up running away whilst leaving a Full_Record23 shaped hole in the wall.", "NTA but tell your mom that until she gets through to her friend to leave you alone you are not going to share space with her friend even if you have to stop visiting your parents. Inform your father of the same.\n\nThe friend at this point is harassing you and needs to stop. You are not her doctor period.", "Yeah, her behavior says different. I think you need to draw some harder boundaries with her.", "Of course she is, she's getting hours and hours of free medical one on one support in you.\n\nI have no doubt she's terrified and hyperfocused on her mortality and options right now, and maybe it's hard for her to see anyone else's pov through the noise right now. Still, this isn't ok, she can't just glue herself to you this way.\n\nAnd it's not fair for your mom--who's also undoubtedly afraid for her friend--to try to guilt you for not being able to do this.\n\nTwo weeks nonstop sounds unmercifully miserable.\n\nNTA", "OP mentioned how mum doesn't speak English, so they wouldn't be in the UK. I think OP and his mum are Europe-based though.", "> The guidance says that you SHOULD NOT be treating friends and family because it's difficult to remain objective. \n\nOMG, I had to read a lot of comments before I came to yours.  Having worked with GYNs/OBs, Surgeons, Internal Medicine, and Pediatricians, this was the rule that they followed.  When I became pregnant with my daughter, one of the OBs I worked for referred me to her SIL because of this reason.", "Yes, and do not cross your eyes, either!", "Muriel probably doesn't ask her doctor (a man)  all of the questions she has because she doesn't expect him to do emotional labor for her.  While you,  a woman,  and her friends daughter, is seen as an unlimited source of emotional labor. \n\nThat was also part of the problem you had at the party. All of those people were expecting you to help them process their feelings. \n\nShe needs a therapist,  or a personal friend.  It is ok for you to be unavailable for emotional labor."]}
