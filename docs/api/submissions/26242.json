{"id": 26242, "submission_id": "16agw37", "title": "AITA for not wanting to take my mother's friend with cancer on a trip with us", "selftext": "So I am a doctor (oncologist) in my 30s. My mother's best friend (55F) got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer few months ago and I set her up with my colleague who specializes in pancreatic cancer and got her every possible care/advantage (early PET appointment, CTs, MRs, etc.) I was able to pull. \n\nNow every time I go visit my mother and she is there (which is quite often), she basically grabs me and wants to speak about her diagnosis, about her chemo, if there is something else I could do for her like irradiation or surgery and what do I think about it. Sometimes it takes hours. When she was freshly diagnosed I was there for her to talk, but it starting to be a little to much. \nThis weekend was my father's 60th birthday and she was there. She sat next to me and kept talking and asking questions for about an hour. I excused myself and went to talk to somebody else but she kept following me and asking more questions even though I told her I don't have answers for her and I cannot give my opinion since I am not her doctor. It continued until I left and I must say it really spoiled the party for me a little. \nWell, for my mother's birthday I got trip to Paris for her and me for 2 weeks and when I told her, she asked if we could take her friend with us. I told her that if she wants to take her friend with her I will withdraw myself because I don't really wanna go with her friend. She can easily go because she has chemo every two weeks so we would just have to go around her schedule. But I want to enjoy it with my mum and I am afraid I won't be able with her friend there. I offered to give my spot to her friend and that they can go together but I knew my mum would refuse since she does not speak English nor French and is afraid of traveling without me. She told me that as a doctor I should be able to understand and give her nice possibly last vacation and we had an argument after. \n\nSo redit AITA?", "created_utc": 1693896980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16agw37/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_mothers_friend/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set a clear boundary when saying you can't give your opinion and she ignored it.", "You have been very kind in helping your mothers friend but you are entitled to your time off. If this woman is at every family gathering harassing you I completely see how that would be overbearing. And nothing you can say or do will ease her mind regardless. Reiterate to your mom that you bought these tickets to spend quality family time with her alone. Her friends condition is a reminder that life is finite. And time with family is very valuable. Maybe she can go on another trip closer to home with her friend, or somewhere they would be more comforfable just the two of them.", "NTA. You can't allow yourself to be in this situation. You've done more than enough already.", "NTA.\n\nStick to your guns. While I'm sympathetic to her condition (I've had relatives passing away due to cancer and cancer survivors too in my family) and it sucks to be in her position, you don't owe all your time talking about her and her disease. Even if you are her doctor, outside of consulting hours you aren't obligated to answer anything.\n\nOnce your mother calms down, talk to her calmly. Tell her gently that \"Mom, it's not that I don't care for your friend. If I didn't, I wouldn't have recommended her to oone of the best doctors that I knew. I am glad that you're thinking so much about emotional well-being of your friend. But at the same time, please put yourself in my shoes. As much as it is draining for the patients like her, I'm equally drained too. Day in and day out I care for so many patients. Most of the times, I even deal with giving them tough diagnosis that they might not make it even with chemo and other therapies. Although I know it is inevitable, it still hurts to see that they don't make it. That's why I've been meaning to go on a trip with you. I wish to relax in your company. Feel the hope that there's life. If your friend were to accompany, I'd be forced to face the same truths that I deal daily. I wouldn't be able to relax and rejuvenate. It's highly important that I'm mentally strong so that I can be there for my patients.\n\nIf you wish to make the trip memorable for your friend, feel free to let her take my spot. Enjoy with her. If language is the issue, change the destination so that both of you will be comfortable. I am ready to go on a different trip with you. But please don't insist that I should accompany with your friend. Vacation trips are meant to be relaxing. With your friend around, I won't be able to. I am not even exaggerating. I couldn't even enjoy dad's birthday party. I didn't even get a break of 5 mins to enjoy myself- thanks to her never ending questions. Heck I can't even answer majority of them because I'm not even her doctor. I am sorry. Please understand\".", "Cancer patient here, but I would not dream of exploiting a friendship and doing what your mum's friend is doing.\n\nFirstly, you need to draw firmer boundaries with your mum's friend. Politely, but firmly. Just keep saying things like \"Muriel, you're not my patient. I can't answer that\". \"Muriel, these are questions for your oncologist, not me\". \"No, Muriel, I can't comment on that, not even off the record. I would be in breach of the ethical and legal code of my profession.\" \"Muriel, I understand this is scary and you need someone to talk to, but I can't be that person.\" \"No, Muriel, I'm not available for that conversation.\" \"Muriel, **you need to stop asking.**\"\n\nKeep saying it like a stuck record. If she never gets any answers from you, I think she will eventually give up - although it may take some time.\n\nSecondly, the trip. I presume your offer to have your mum's friend go with her (and withdraw yourself) means that you would be the one paying for her friend? If so, that was an extremely generous offer. You've gone above and beyond what any reasonable person could expect of you, so don't let your mother guilt you on the fact that you would withdraw if her friend goes.\n\nIt's sad that the friend has a particularly nasty cancer which may end up being terminal. But that is not your fault, and you are not required to spend time with a person whose company you do not enjoy, and who is likely to keep pushing your boundaries harder than she already has been because you're effectively trapped with her for two weeks.\n\nHave you actually told your mother **why** you don't want to spend two weeks with her friend? - i.e. the reasons you told us here?\n\nMy surviving parent is a very social person and has lots of friends, some of whom I like very much, but some of whom are a pain in the ass. I've actually told my parent, in relation to a couple of them: if you're planning to invite Edna or Marvin over for lunch or a coffee or whatever, can you please give me a heads up? - so I can visit you on a day when they're not there. And I explained to my parent: I'm glad you like them and their friendship is valuable to you, but I'm sorry, they just rub me the wrong way, and the feeling is probably mutual, so it's best if I'm not around them. My parent was not offended at all, as far as I know. And there's no way in the world I would agree to two weeks in the company of a person I do not like. I had to do that growing up, with one of my sisters, whom I loathe. No way am I doing it with a parent's friend, especially if I'm the one paying.\n\nI have an alternative suggestion. You said your mum does not want to travel to Paris without you because she speaks neither English nor French. OK, then. If you're in a generous mood, why not offer to send your mother and her friend on a short trip to a place where they **do** speak the language? For instance, somewhere in their own country that they particularly love, or have always wanted to visit? Then you could save the Paris trip with your mum for some later date. That way, you still get a trip alone with your mum later on, her friend gets a trip with your mum now which may end up being her last, and you get to look like the generous benefactor.\n\nEdited to add a judgment: NTA.", "NTA - You are not her doctor and not required to talk to her about her illness for hours whenever she feels like it.

I told her that and made emphasis on how even if she gives me her approval I still could get in trouble if somebody connects my login and somebody else's patient. Well the thing she did next was that when she knew I would be at my mother's she brought all her medical reports for me so I go through them. It really is exhausting but I always feel like such an ass when I tell her I am not going to discuss it with her. But there is really nothing else I can do.", "My mother is very proud of me.

Actually the whole party was really bummer for me. \n\nI tried to explain my mother but her only answer is that she is just scared and I should understand.", "Thank you. I'm hanging in there.

If that doesn't work, nothing will.\n\nAbove all, don't give in - to either of them. Do not spend any more of your valuable leisure time being Muriel's unpaid oncologist. And don't you dare let Muriel tag along on vacation with you and your mum.\n\nIt is likely that one or both of them will have their feelings hurt by your refusal. That's unfortunate, but their feelings are their responsibility, not yours.

Would that be fair ? My son is a medical professional so this is where I\u2019m coming from . It\u2019s from what he is saying .

And Again, I sent her to my colleague because he is one of the best oncologists when it comes to pancreatic cancer, so why would I overrule him and his decisions ? I prescribed her pain meds when he was on vacation, but AFTER discussing it with him first because, again, I don't know her as a patient but that's it.

I think she is just hurting and acting unreasonable.", "Ok that\u2019s a fair assessment . It still doesn\u2019t help you at all . What if you spoke to her doctor and had them explain to her that you cannot deal with her queries . That she can talk to him if she needs to know something . Plus if she wants an actual second opinion you can give her names perhaps ?? I dunno . I\u2019m reaching here but I see how you are in a no win situation .", "We speak with him quite often as he is my good friend and we re having lunches together. I might try to ask him to ask her if she wants another doctor since she does not seem to believe his opinion, that might work.\nBut I don't see why she would to that. She is actually responding well to the treatment and according to him everything is going better than expected so that's about it. Anyway thank you for your time. I feel less shitty about the whole situation"]}
