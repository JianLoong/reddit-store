Not really. You can't pay a random teen to come and watch your problematic goat when you're tired. Ag students are hard to come by in specialties, and when an animal gets sick you can't really reliably get someone, you've gotta be confident you can help the animal, and a half-ton cow ain't gonna get in a trailer. They're far harder to wrangle than a toddler you can pick up and bodily carry if you need to.\n\nWorking farm labor is being a parent to children who can't talk to you in varying age ranges and are often more than three times your size, and usually if it's a working farm, you've got WAY more than one.

I'm petty so those are my easiest n safest solutions to not have more problems.", "NTA - she's definitely one of those people that wants special attention because she became a mom. Ugh ....  I can't stand those types. Louder for people in the back ..... Nobody is special because they squeezed out a kid.", "NTA - next time tell her to come off the cross we need the wood.", "You should've just let her vent? Why does that statement not apply to you? I feel like she has become this way from too many people enabling her pity parties NTA", "Not the asshole!!! She will always be a 1 upper where it be kids job family\nEtc. all\nThe people around her just enable as they only\nHave to listen here and there at functions", "I mean, when everyone is talking about their lives, what do you expect her to talk about? She\u2019s likely just trying really hard to be relevant.\n\nESH.", "Nta life is hard for everyone it shouldn't be a competition what a weird thing to be competitive about.  Also having an animal is in a way like having a kid , my cat throws up on the floor , cries when she wants attention soooo... ? . I just would cut her off she sounds exhausting", "NTA.. yes being a sahm is hard but working is hard too... I can't stand when people compare the 2. She gets plenty of breaks. That's not a 24/7 mom.. \nI been a sahm and a working mom.. I'm a working mom now And I feel like it's 20x harder then just being a sahm. That's just my opinion.\n\nYou will never change her mind OP so it's not worth the stress.", "NTA. Funny she got pissed at you for calling the baby goats \"kids\". Because, well, it's a delightful coincidence that that's the actual term for them haha", "NTA. You just a G", "Nta", "NTA.  I high five your petty response.  Grammy and grandpappy cow shirts for everyone.", "Hahahahaha NTA! Farm life is hard and is an actual 24/7 job, because granny and pop pop goat can't help with the \"kids\" multiple times a week. Your friend is not really a friend. You are her audience for her drama. Much love and take care of all the farm babies as I'm sure you awesomely do \u2764\ufe0f (plus enjoy any free time you get!)", "Yeah, something tells me that no matter what Gina did in her life, she'd find some way to garner sympathy for it. I was a SAHM mom for almost 20yrs before rejoining the workforce and I can definitely say that managing three stores in my town's historic/tourist district is far, far more physically draining than taking care of my kiddo. Even when my little guy was an infant, I wasn't incredibly stressed or overwhelmed, even with him having a somewhat scary genetic disorder that left him vulnerable to injury and illness. I guess part of it is a true love of motherhood, but I really enjoyed being a SAHM. That said, after 20 years of it I was BORED out of my mind and would have returned to work years ago had I not promised my MIL that I wouldn't work until my son graduated high school. If Gina is complaining this much she's either suffering from PPD, not cut out for full time parenting, or simply has a martyr complex.", "Love this", "As a parent: parenting is very very hard. Especially without family support (which Gina has). But you know what else is hard? Working a farm. Working in a factory. Studying for exams. Caring for a parent with dementia. Parenting is just a particular flavour of hard, and parents sure as shit don\u2019t have a monopoly on hard.", "I often find that people like Gina who trumpet their parenting as their main identity with this \u201cone up\u201d mentality are also folks who happen to not have any hobbies, goals, talents, etc. They usually compensate for this by making everything about the fact that they\u2019re a proud parent who moves mountains daily in order to keep their kids alive", "She did apologize and part of her getting up in the night was me having her get up to check on him with me.", "Yes, blank stare and then a slow blink!", "Yes!!", "Then an eyeroll and \"AAAAAAnywayyyys...\"", "It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m the exact opposite lol I loved every single moment I worked on a farm and would\u2019ve done it forever if I could\u2019ve, and I absolutely cannot see myself working well as a SAHM", "This. Farm sitters are pretty much worth their weight in gold. We always hear about nightmare situations where people hire pet sitters who can't be bothered to come over and scoop out some kibble into a dish for a cat yet trying to find someone who can actually *reliably* tend livestock is like hunting for a needle in a haystack.", "I loved working on a huge rescue horse farm.  It was so dang hard but it was glorious too.", "I didn\u2019t even realize this was a job and now I wish I invested in an agriculture/dairy masters instead of nursing. I worked on farms for like 10 years (including growing up next to and helping on a commercial dairy farm) and it was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been", "Ohhh I was a horse/stable sitter for years.  Loved it.  Trying to get back into it since we moved."]}
