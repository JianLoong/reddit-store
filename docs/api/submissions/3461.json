I get it, parenting is hard, not denying that but I definitely feel like she oversells it: her husband works from home half the time so he can help out with the kids more. They get every other weekend to themselves because the kids are at their grandparents. Both sets of grandparents also take the kids a few hours during weekdays so she gets breaks. I live and work on my in-laws' farm. Sometimes when I\u2019m talking about the animals or equipment she\u2019ll start up and I\u2019ve asked her how she figures she gets no days off with that setup and she\u2019d say I just don\u2019t get it because I\u2019ve never been a parent.

In September Gina took me up on the offer when her inlaws took the kids for a week and she wanted to see what made my job supposedly hard. I pretty much had her shadow me day and night and do all of the work around the farm with me, and there was even an animal emergency that she caused.

Well, this past weekend one of our friends had a get-together.

When our friend asked why I was so tired and I explained why, Gina chimed in how baby goats shouldn\u2019t be called \u2018kids\u2019 because taking care of animals is nothing like taking care of actual children and the two aren\u2019t anywhere near the same.\n\nI kinda lost it.

However, are you sure Gina isn't doing this one upping just so she has something to talk about because she doesn't work the way the rest of you do? Maybe it's her way of trying to fit in?

All of my kids are neurodivergent and like, never slept. All this is to say, yeah, I get it. Parenting is tough and intense and feels very relentless!

Once in a while is fine, vent away but every time gets draining.
