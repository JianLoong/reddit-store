And we have two kids together (m12 and m10)\n\nI remarried a year late while she\u2019s still single. I have 3 further kids (f9, f7 f3). \n\nI have my sons over every weekend. About 4 years, my ex wife opened up a online business and she\u2019s been making 6 figures. While my wife is a stay at home mum and I make 30k to support our family.\n\nSo you can imagine how this difference has effected our 2 households. They live in a gated community, she drives a 2022 rsq3. And she and our sons go on 2 extravagant holidays a year.\n\nMy sons came over this weekend and starting tell me and the girls they\u2019re going on a Disney concierge cruise in the summer. My daughters started crying saying daddy we wanna go, and when I looked online for the prices they\u2019re priced at $5k per person. \n\nIt\u2019s been all they\u2019ve talking about non-stop. I feel like their wealth is being shoved down our throats, when we can barely afford heating this Christmas.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be hateful but I sent her a long text saying stop trying to make us feel less than. I also told my sons in private pls don\u2019t mention holidays or gifts around the girls.\n\nShe replied with saying it\u2019s not her problem how we feel, and when she does nice things for the boys. Me and my wife are the last people on her mind? \n\nam I reading into this too much?

I do however agree with your kids with your ex maybe being a little more considerate around your other kids though. You should definitely try and control any over the top bragging etc. Unfortunately though as your kids grow up there will be some differences that can\u2019t be hidden away (nicer cars, nicer clothes etc) and you are going to have to find a way to manage that. The answer however is NOT to DEMAND your ex deprive her kids from things just because you can\u2019t afford the same. That is not fair to her or your kids with her. Also, if your kids with her find out you are demanding that (now or in the future) you are going to be dealing with a lot of anger and resentment from them and they will likely pull away from you and not wanting to spend as much time with you.", "YTA", "YTA, your ex-wife (and thus sons when in her care) isn't required to live below her means to protect your feelings.", "YTA.

And we have two kids together (m12 and m10)\n\nI remarried a year late while she\u2019s still single. I have 3 further kids (f9, f7 f3). \n\nI have my sons over every weekend. About 4 years, my ex wife opened up a online business and she\u2019s been making 6 figures. While my wife is a stay at home mum and I make 30k to support our family.\n\nSo you can imagine how this difference has effected our 2 households. They live in a gated community, she drives a 2022 rsq3. And she and our sons go on 2 extravagant holidays a year.\n\nMy sons came over this weekend and starting tell me and the girls they\u2019re going on a Disney concierge cruise in the summer. My daughters started crying saying daddy we wanna go, and when I looked online for the prices they\u2019re priced at $5k per person. \n\nIt\u2019s been all they\u2019ve talking about non-stop. I feel like their wealth is being shoved down our throats, when we can barely afford heating this Christmas.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be hateful but I sent her a long text saying stop trying to make us feel less than. I also told my sons in private pls don\u2019t mention holidays or gifts around the girls.\n\nShe replied with saying it\u2019s not her problem how we feel, and when she does nice things for the boys. Me and my wife are the last people on her mind? \n\nam I reading into this too much? Or am I the asshole for saying she\u2019s spiteful?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She turned a home business into a success and is taking great care of your boys. Good for her! \n\nP.S.\n\n>While my wife is a stay at home mum and I make 30k to support our family.\n\n2 adults and 5 kids live on 30k??? How is this even feasible in today's economy?", "YTA.  And the timeline reads like you were more than likely cheating on her with new wife. Your ex is living her best life and keeping your kids happy.  They can keep it to themselves, that's the least you can ask of them.  But you had more kids than you can afford.  That's on you and new wife should get a job.", "YTA. Not her fault you don't make as much as her. She isn't being spiteful by spoiling her children, I'm sure you'd do the same if the situations were reversed. Sucks your girls can't go, but that's life.", "Seems to me that she\u2019s not the one being spiteful. YTA", "YTA she didn\u2019t flaunt anything. That was your kids who were probably just excited and didn\u2019t realize the implications. Time to buck up and remind each set of kids that we don\u2019t always have the same things as our siblings or other family members. Your 9 and probably even the 7 year old can understand the concept not being able to afford expensive things on a whim and the 3 year old is young enough to distract.", "YTA, you need to be looking inwards not out\u2026 she\u2019s not TA for providing a good life for her kids. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask your boys to not mention certain things around the girls but kids get excited and just want to share with everyone sometimes.

You thinking its a personal attack is low. \n\nTry not to take it out on your boys, they are excited as they should be. Let them tell you all about it privately. Don't give them a complex making them feel guilty for things they are grateful for.", "YTA 30k with 5 kids?\n\nThat's like 7 dollars an hour. Are you working part time, entry level at a fast food place?\n\nIf you're in the US that is. I shouldn't assume, but there is some context in the language.", "YTA - it\u2019s not your ex\u2019s fault she\u2019s doing well.

Seems like you are upset that she is doing far better.", "Her life has nothing to do with you anymore, providing for herself and the boys it s not a spiteful act, she  have dreams and the means to make them reality. You are really reading too much, you have five kids she only has two her money will stretch more logically.", "YTA,  probably should have thought of that before you cheated and had five kids you couldn't afford.", "YTA, you could be making more. DID you bother to learn anything is 10 years? and what's with having 3 more when you make $15/hr? That's Taco Bell, Mc Donalds ect money. Learn a trade. Community colleges have 2 year programs. And it might be time for the Stay at home mom to start earning. \n\nGranted at 10 and 12 the boys are old enough to be sat down and told..\"It's wonderful that your mom can afford to do this with you, But I can't afford to do this with the girls, can please not mention around them, I makes them want it and I can't provided it. \" Just to prevent you kids some pain, and a gentile teaching of empathy won't hurt them. \n\nAlso you wife stays at home she could make some money, with Etsy, or even taking in kids, even if it's just for a few hours after school.", "YTA. Man I don\u2019t want to be rude but why would you have 4 kids when you only make 30k and your wife makes nothing. Like what we\u2019re you thinking. You\u2019re doing your kids a disservice by doing this. I have a hard time believing that the only job you can find is one that pays 30k.

They\u2019re kids and they\u2019re excited. I\u2019m 22 and barely able to keep quiet about my Disney trip that\u2019s in 2 weeks. Maybe just explain to your kids about money or something", "You're absolutely reading too much into it. And no, your financial situation isn't her fault or problem. I know it can be a sore point for men with the whole toxic \"provider\" mentality, and that sucks. I'm sorry you perhaps feel lesser than, but that's not your ex's intention.", "So instead of making sure you were in a good financial position you had three more kids? Now you are upset your ex-wife makes more and is able to support her children and given them the life she wants them to have and you are sour over it? \n\nYes YTA and you are projecting all your insecurities. Only you can change your position and trying to make your ex-wife look bad isn't going to help that. How about you tell your current wife to go get a job and help contribute to the household?", "This isn't really anything your ex is doing wrong. I do think you should ask your older kids not to talk about the fabulous vacations. I don't talk about fabulous vacations when I'm visiting my poorer friends. That's just general manners, and your kids are old enough to start learning that. \n\nHowever, sometimes the wealth difference will come up in conversation even if people aren't trying to bring it up (\"why can't you come to my party? You'll be on vacation? Where?\") and so you'll also need to teach your younger kids either to not dig for financial info they won't like, or to accept the answers gracefully. \n\nSo the short answer is that you just need to parent your kids. I'm not saying you aren't doing that; it's a process and takes a while. They will all have to learn to live with the fact that they have different lifestyles.", "YTA. Maybe stop sticking your dick in things unprotected if you can't even afford to buy heating.

Don\u2019t take your own failures out on your kids from either relationship.

Get a certification or trade.", "YTA Find a better paying job for starters", "YTA you\u2019ve had more kids than you can afford.

The only thing you should have done is had a conversation with your sons about the differences in wealth between the two households and how it's not polite to brag about things that indicate wealth to those who have less.", "YTA. It\u2019s not her problem you\u2019re not financially stable. You have 5 kids. What\u2019s your long term goal? Why is your wife still at home?

Seriously? \u201c I\u2019m earning a low wage so you must also either earn a low wage and struggle or I will think you are only doing it to be spiteful\u201d ..Nah OP, she is living her best life and you are not even an afterthought in it. YTA", ">\"Or am I the asshole for saying she\u2019s spiteful?\" .. YES, you are.\n\nYes, the ex being spiteful is a super weird leap? I don't understand where OP is getting her trying to make them feel less then from. \n\n>My sons came over this weekend and starting tell me and the girls they\u2019re going on a Disney concierge cruise in the summer. My daughters started crying saying daddy we wanna go, and when I looked online for the prices they\u2019re priced at $5k per person.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s been all they\u2019ve talking about non-stop. I feel like their wealth is being shoved down our throats, when we can barely afford heating this Christmas.\n\nThis is really hard, and I'm sorry. But I don't see why you'd assume it's something your ex planned to make you feel bad? \n\nYour sons are being insensitive and of course it is going to make their half-siblings feel bad. It would have been okay to politely ask your wife for help in talking to your sons about this if they aren't getting it when you talk to them. But not in an accusatory way? Something like telling her you understand A and B are super excited about their upcoming Disney Cruise, but your really struggling finically right now and even avoiding niceties this holiday is difficult. Could she help you explain to the boys how bringing up their cruise again and again is making their younger siblings feel? It's okay for the boys to be happy and excited, but repeatedly bringing it up to the younger kids after you've explained to the boys that the younger kids can't afford to go is hurtful. You don't think the boys intend to upset them, but may not understand what it's like to be in the younger kid's shoes and how it makes them feel. They keep bringing it up, so you'd appreciate ex's help. Thank you.\n\nYou already messed that up though, so you'd have to include a big apology first. \n\nOr, have you really discussed this with your sons? Do they understand how much less money you have then their mom? Do they understand how their younger half-siblings feel? And after talking to them, did they keep doing it? Beacuse you'd try to handle it yourself first.", "ntm the timing is strange\n\nDaughter with new wife is one year younger than son with old wife.\n\nSeems like he was cheating with new wife, knocked her up so they got divorced and he remarried new baby mama.\n\nMaybe it's not THAT bad, but it is suspicious.", "My favorite quote applies here: \"I'm not intimidating, you're intimidated.\"  YTA.  \n\nNot the wife's problem.", "Good parents teach empathy. You wouldn\u2019t brag endlessly to a stranger who can\u2019t afford heating that you\u2019re going on a Disney cruise. Telling people is one thing but this is on and on and on. Why is it okay to treat their own half-siblings worse than a stranger? \n\nESH. It\u2019s nothing to do with spite. But OP being jealous and resentful doesn\u2019t change that his ex is raising their boys to torment children who live almost in poverty. If you think that\u2019s absolutely fine because they have no \u2018obligation\u2019 to give a shit about others, why live in a society?", "Yup and only making 30k he decides to have two more. Like dude, do not have 5 kids if you cannot afford them. Someone needs a snip snip visit to the Dr. Asap!", "Eh if he's British 30k is decent and would be enough for a married couple but not really for 5 kids. Living wage in the UK is about \u00a310.90 an hour outside of London.", "So is cheating \ud83d\ude1f", "Long game. Lol\n\nOP, yta. This is where you process your feelings and help your kids do the same. Not project.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been safe to ask your ex advice if she can help keep the boys from flaunting (if they are, sounds like they\u2019re actually just excited telling you all about it). In any case you can teach your boys to be sensitive to not flaunt to the girls. Talking about their lives is fine, the girls will have to meet people who have more than them in life and you need to model gratitude (not resent or blame others and let the girls think that\u2019s how we handle that).\n\nBut your feelings are your own, you clearly think you one upped your ex by being remarried first and such. Now you have learned comparing yourself is not how you fulfill your life. Ex has moved on and it\u2019s paying off. It has nothing to do with you and has no reflection of you.\n\nNow look at your life and see what you want to do/provide for your family. 30k with a sahm is a good life if you\u2019re genuinely a humble family man and can make it work financially. Your ex wife made different choices, you can learn from it or just accept you have different lifestyles that fit you. You don\u2019t get to resent others for doing well for themselves, it\u2019s petty and pointless.

Every time she would make strides or start to rise up he would be unsupportive and probably make comments telling her to \u201cknow her place\u201d. I\u2019m sure he also tried his best to sabotage many of her opportunities and when even that didn\u2019t work, he tried the ultimate betrayal of leaving her with two young children to fend for herself while he shacked up with someone else.\n\nThis is obviously pure speculation based off of zero evidence (this is Reddit lmao), but I was married to someone like what I\u2019ve described and it ended very similarly.

His wife will almost certainly be entitled to some kind of benefits depending on the reason she's unemployed, and additional benefits will be helping with at least two of the kids.\n\nBut yes, those barriers do still exist. Childcare vouchers can reduce the cost up to a certain age, but its not abnormal for one parent to stay at home, especially when she's barely getting through maternity leave before she's pregnant again.", "In the UK a \u00a330k salary is not really enough to support an entire family but unfortunately still average/above average in some areas. And it's commonplace for mothers to stay at home because the cost of childcare is the highest in the world.

I defaulted to thinking US, but maybe it's Canada?\nDoubt it'd be Australia as the cost of living is higher there than it is in all of the other places so he'd be homeless on that salary. \nBut then again he did say stay at home mum, which apparently is a British expression?", "I always love on here that there's a long discussion about different states with the automatic assumption that everyone lives in the US.

I don't think if he was Australian he'd be mentioning heating costs right now.\n\nIf it's the UK, it's plausible. 30K is a plausible low average salary depending on industry, and there are plenty of people surviving on it, although it would be better if it were a two salary family. His concern about heating costs struck me as very plausible for here in the UK. They would certainly be struggling with energy costs with only one income and lots of kids.", "Yeah, I'm Aussie and I can't see him surviving here on 30K with a family of 5-7, plus it was 37C (98.6F for those in America) in my town today, we aren't worrying about staying warm this Christmas.", "I think I\u2019m done states it\u2019s by in one.

That means he either left her while she was pregnant or a very small child because it\u2019s hard to get a divorce quickly when you have kids. Then he has another child that\u2019s 9. Those are two very close ages and I would not be surprised if he had been cheating.

One child is an accident, but 5 across 2 women? Come on. When I was making 30k I was barely able to cover my own costs while living frugally... Never mind even CONSIDERING having a child, let alone 3 while I left 2 with an at the time unemployed mom. \n\nConsidering both of his oldest with each woman is the age of the relationship itself, I'd wager just from that info and this post that OP is unable to ever comprehend the consequences of his actions.", "I doubt OP is the type of man that would do his share around the house and with childcare of three kids.
