About 4 years, my ex wife opened up a online business and she\u2019s been making 6 figures. While my wife is a stay at home mum and I make 30k to support our family.\n\nSo you can imagine how this difference has effected our 2 households. They live in a gated community, she drives a 2022 rsq3. And she and our sons go on 2 extravagant holidays a year.\n\nMy sons came over this weekend and starting tell me and the girls they\u2019re going on a Disney concierge cruise in the summer. My daughters started crying saying daddy we wanna go, and when I looked online for the prices they\u2019re priced at $5k per person. \n\nIt\u2019s been all they\u2019ve talking about non-stop. I feel like their wealth is being shoved down our throats, when we can barely afford heating this Christmas.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be hateful but I sent her a long text saying stop trying to make us feel less than. I also told my sons in private pls don\u2019t mention holidays or gifts around the girls.\n\nShe replied with saying it\u2019s not her problem how we feel, and when she does nice things for the boys. Me and my wife are the last people on her mind? \n\nam I reading into this too much?

I\u2019m sorry you feel resentful, and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s not a fairly normal feeling most would have in your situation, but it\u2019s your problem to deal with. I do however agree with your kids with your ex maybe being a little more considerate around your other kids though. You should definitely try and control any over the top bragging etc. Unfortunately though as your kids grow up there will be some differences that can\u2019t be hidden away (nicer cars, nicer clothes etc) and you are going to have to find a way to manage that. The answer however is NOT to DEMAND your ex deprive her kids from things just because you can\u2019t afford the same. That is not fair to her or your kids with her. Also, if your kids with her find out you are demanding that (now or in the future) you are going to be dealing with a lot of anger and resentment from them and they will likely pull away from you and not wanting to spend as much time with you.", "YTA", "YTA, your ex-wife (and thus sons when in her care) isn't required to live below her means to protect your feelings.", "YTA.

You have to explain to your daughters that you can't afford those things and it's hard and embarrassing and hurts but it's also FINE. You can do that. And they will be okay without those things.

And we have two kids together (m12 and m10)\n\nI remarried a year late while she\u2019s still single. I have 3 further kids (f9, f7 f3). \n\nI have my sons over every weekend. About 4 years, my ex wife opened up a online business and she\u2019s been making 6 figures. While my wife is a stay at home mum and I make 30k to support our family.\n\nSo you can imagine how this difference has effected our 2 households. They live in a gated community, she drives a 2022 rsq3. And she and our sons go on 2 extravagant holidays a year.\n\nMy sons came over this weekend and starting tell me and the girls they\u2019re going on a Disney concierge cruise in the summer. My daughters started crying saying daddy we wanna go, and when I looked online for the prices they\u2019re priced at $5k per person. \n\nIt\u2019s been all they\u2019ve talking about non-stop. I feel like their wealth is being shoved down our throats, when we can barely afford heating this Christmas.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be hateful but I sent her a long text saying stop trying to make us feel less than. I also told my sons in private pls don\u2019t mention holidays or gifts around the girls.\n\nShe replied with saying it\u2019s not her problem how we feel, and when she does nice things for the boys. Me and my wife are the last people on her mind? \n\nam I reading into this too much? Or am I the asshole for saying she\u2019s spiteful?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She turned a home business into a success and is taking great care of your boys. Good for her! \n\nP.S.\n\n>While my wife is a stay at home mum and I make 30k to support our family.\n\n2 adults and 5 kids live on 30k??? How is this even feasible in today's economy?", "YTA.  And the timeline reads like you were more than likely cheating on her with new wife. Your ex is living her best life and keeping your kids happy.  They can keep it to themselves, that's the least you can ask of them.  But you had more kids than you can afford.  That's on you and new wife should get a job.", "YTA. Not her fault you don't make as much as her. She isn't being spiteful by spoiling her children, I'm sure you'd do the same if the situations were reversed. Sucks your girls can't go, but that's life.", "Seems to me that she\u2019s not the one being spiteful. YTA", "YTA she didn\u2019t flaunt anything. That was your kids who were probably just excited and didn\u2019t realize the implications. Time to buck up and remind each set of kids that we don\u2019t always have the same things as our siblings or other family members. Your 9 and probably even the 7 year old can understand the concept not being able to afford expensive things on a whim and the 3 year old is young enough to distract.", "YTA, you need to be looking inwards not out\u2026 she\u2019s not TA for providing a good life for her kids. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask your boys to not mention certain things around the girls but kids get excited and just want to share with everyone sometimes. If you\u2019re really struggling can your wife not work part time or anything?\n\nVery suspicious about the age gap between your second and third, raises a lot more questions\u2026 Suspect you thought you were getting a \u201cbetter deal\u201d with your new wife, whether that be age, looks, etc and you\u2019re bitter her life is significantly better without you.", "YTA- its hard to look at two of your kids being gifted these different experiences that you can't give to your other kids, it's a sh\\*t feeling. You thinking its a personal attack is low. \n\nTry not to take it out on your boys, they are excited as they should be. Let them tell you all about it privately. Don't give them a complex making them feel guilty for things they are grateful for.", "YTA 30k with 5 kids?\n\nThat's like 7 dollars an hour. Are you working part time, entry level at a fast food place?\n\nIf you're in the US that is. I shouldn't assume, but there is some context in the language.", "YTA - it\u2019s not your ex\u2019s fault she\u2019s doing well. You should be glad she\u2019s taking good care of your kids and spoiling them.", "YTA\n\nSo why can't your wife take on a part time job again?  Or you take on a part time job?  Seems like you are upset that she is doing far better.", "Her life has nothing to do with you anymore, providing for herself and the boys it s not a spiteful act, she  have dreams and the means to make them reality. You are really reading too much, you have five kids she only has two her money will stretch more logically.", "YTA,  probably should have thought of that before you cheated and had five kids you couldn't afford.", "YTA, you could be making more. DID you bother to learn anything is 10 years? and what's with having 3 more when you make $15/hr? That's Taco Bell, Mc Donalds ect money. Learn a trade. Community colleges have 2 year programs. And it might be time for the Stay at home mom to start earning. \n\nGranted at 10 and 12 the boys are old enough to be sat down and told..\"It's wonderful that your mom can afford to do this with you, But I can't afford to do this with the girls, can please not mention around them, I makes them want it and I can't provided it. \" Just to prevent you kids some pain, and a gentile teaching of empathy won't hurt them. \n\nAlso you wife stays at home she could make some money, with Etsy, or even taking in kids, even if it's just for a few hours after school.", "YTA. Man I don\u2019t want to be rude but why would you have 4 kids when you only make 30k and your wife makes nothing. Like what we\u2019re you thinking. You\u2019re doing your kids a disservice by doing this. I have a hard time believing that the only job you can find is one that pays 30k. Can you learn a trade or go to night school etc. Also it\u2019s not your exs fault she became successful.", "YTA", "YTA\u2026\n\nMy ex makes more than me and currently owes me money for shared medical expenses and some missed CS payments.

They\u2019re kids and they\u2019re excited. I\u2019m 22 and barely able to keep quiet about my Disney trip that\u2019s in 2 weeks. Maybe just explain to your kids about money or something", "You're absolutely reading too much into it. And no, your financial situation isn't her fault or problem. I know it can be a sore point for men with the whole toxic \"provider\" mentality, and that sucks. I'm sorry you perhaps feel lesser than, but that's not your ex's intention.", "So instead of making sure you were in a good financial position you had three more kids? Now you are upset your ex-wife makes more and is able to support her children and given them the life she wants them to have and you are sour over it? \n\nYes YTA and you are projecting all your insecurities. Only you can change your position and trying to make your ex-wife look bad isn't going to help that. How about you tell your current wife to go get a job and help contribute to the household?", "This isn't really anything your ex is doing wrong. I do think you should ask your older kids not to talk about the fabulous vacations. I don't talk about fabulous vacations when I'm visiting my poorer friends. That's just general manners, and your kids are old enough to start learning that. \n\nHowever, sometimes the wealth difference will come up in conversation even if people aren't trying to bring it up (\"why can't you come to my party? You'll be on vacation? Where?\") and so you'll also need to teach your younger kids either to not dig for financial info they won't like, or to accept the answers gracefully. \n\nSo the short answer is that you just need to parent your kids. I'm not saying you aren't doing that; it's a process and takes a while. They will all have to learn to live with the fact that they have different lifestyles.", "YTA. Maybe stop sticking your dick in things unprotected if you can't even afford to buy heating.

Don\u2019t take your own failures out on your kids from either relationship.

Get a certification or trade.", "YTA Find a better paying job for starters", "YTA you\u2019ve had more kids than you can afford.

The only thing you should have done is had a conversation with your sons about the differences in wealth between the two households and how it's not polite to brag about things that indicate wealth to those who have less.", "YTA. It\u2019s not her problem you\u2019re not financially stable. You have 5 kids. What\u2019s your long term goal? Why is your wife still at home?

She did not make his other 3 kids. \n\nHe shouldn't have had 3 more kids if he can provide for all 5.", "This would be an insanely inappropriate request. He obviously couldn't pay, since it would cost half his annual income to do so. It would be beyond grossly entitled to ask her to provide free childcare for them and put down an additional 15k to take his 3 kids along. His poor life planning isn't her concern and it isn't her responsibility to fix it. She is only responsible for her own children and she's entitled to provide them whatever vacation she can afford *for her own kids.* It's up to him and his wife to provide for the children they have together.", "Right?", "I'm trying to envision the annual budget.  Even assuming 30k is after tax, and lowballing every expense, it's something like:\n\n|Expense|Annual Cost|\n:--|:--|\n|Rent|12,000|\n|Child Support|2,400|\n|Utilities|1,200|\n|Groceries|9,000|\n|Health Insurance|3,000|\n|Everything Else|2,400|", "My favorite part when when he pointed out she\u2019s still single. Like that\u2019s the worst thing he can come up with for her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be sobbing into her Disney cocktails.", "Right? And what if ex-wife were like, \u201cstop having more children so you can rub your relationship in my face!!\u201d? She has more disposable income, he has more kids. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f They made their choices.", "\"HOW DARE SHE BE SUCCESSFUL AND DRIVE A NEW CAR IN A GATED COMMUNITY?!\"\n\nHmm, can't imagine why they ever divorced :P", "I like the part where he has a ten year old and a nine year old with two different women and he's been divorced for a decade.", "He 100% cheated, that's why he's extra salty.\n\nI was just asking cuz I wanted to know what lie he would come up with. It's entertaining. \ud83d\ude29", "They can, but his envy and focus on his ex still being single and using a word like 'spiteful' is sus.", "im 23 and still never been to disney but fuck, when my in laws said they wanted to take all the kids and spouses to disney for a christmas in the next few years, i was ecstatic lmao", "In the US at least, CS is designed to kind of equalize things between two homes. Number of overnights a month are one part of the equation. But there are more inputs including other kids, his income, her income, etc. So even if you have the kids more or less, it doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019re not paying support if you make a whole lot more. \n\nWe had to pay my husband\u2019s ex wife several thousand a month even though the kids were with us the majority of the time.", "And then he proceeded to *blame his ex-wife*. \n\nFrom the tone of how he implied he talked to her, I don't know that his conversation with his kids was as constructive as it shoulda been.", "Right. It\u2019s more hard work and karma then revenge.", "I didn\u2019t really mean flaunt in a malicious way, but kids with wealth (hopefully) eventually learn that some people might not have a holiday, let alone multiple thousand dollar trips and might feel upset about not getting that experience", "I thought I was picking up a little remorse as well for the life missed out on with the first wife. \n\nDid you notice the timing of the divorce, along with the ages of the youngest son and oldest daughter?", "I see why people put ah but in my eyes he just wanted to try to make his kids feel better and to stop the problem, he never said he was rude in the text but if he was I would be on the line of asshole but without that information I just think he wants to help", "Yeah, it's a close one for sure. I guess it really comes down to specific word choice and how forcefully he said it to her, but to me it wasn't quite over the line.", "Well, how do you know they aren't? The idea isn't that outrageous.", "I'm not saying she has to lol I was just saying what if she was cool with taking their siblings", "I mean if shes up for it why not? They are siblings after all and if she felt like she wanted to that'd be cool. It's really unlikely but a thought", "I mean if shes up for it why not? They are siblings after all and if she felt like she wanted to that'd be cool. It's really unlikely but a thought", "I dont disagree but I was just offering a thought", "She obviously focuses more on raising and supporting the kids she already had", "I LOVE the 'she'll be sobbing into her Disney cocktails'!!!! LOL", "Yes. The cocktails. Being single is freedom. He may have cured her of wanting marriage.", "Check the ages of the kids for a clue.", "The whole tone of the post smacks as jealousy to me", "Her business only started like 6 years after the marriage though, so there wasn't that discrepancy when they were together.\n\nI don't think she would be expected to pay him to meet her at her current net worth in 2022, especially if she has primary custody.", "It won't be for his children with her it will help the other children which shouldn't happen. How will he prove he is using CS to his children with her and not the other.\n\nAnd he only has them one weekend so.", "Those rules are usually state specific, so your state may not match what is required in OP\u2019s state", "That\u2019s not how it works in all of the US. Where I am it\u2019s a formula that looks at his income, her income, and where the kids spend what percentage of nights. Choosing to have subsequent children you can\u2019t afford doesn\u2019t get you more child support on the ones you had with someone else.", "oH, OKAY.", "I totally get that! But they are 12 and 10 - I think there is still time to teach them more tact! Plus, if you're a father asking your kids at the dinner table about what they've got going on and what they're excited about, I'm sure vacations naturally come up. This father might want to think about how filtered he wants his older kids to grow up to be around them because they might just stop telling him things because they don't want him to feel some sort of way, you know?", "The kids are going on an awesome trip they\u2019re excited for. No one regardless of age should have to be quiet about something they\u2019re excited for because some people can\u2019t afford it. Should no one get joy out of life?", "Wow, he got the new girl knocked up *quick*.", "Calling someone spiteful when all they're doing is living their life and providing for children they share, isn't rude? \n\nMaking one set if children feel better by restricting what the other set talks about isn't the right way to go about it.  As a child that had that done to them it will have likely made them feel as though they did something wrong.  He should have explained that he would have liked to take them but the boys mum earns more than them, then offered a treat within his affordability.  It's not rocket science.  He might have been a good dad to one set if his kid but he was a shit dad to the other.", "Did you notice how close his youngest with his ex is to his oldest with his current wife is in age? It looks like cheating is a real possibility..\n\nIf she is booking vacations without caring about the ex\u2019s family dynamic (which isn\u2019t an obligation she has) she isn\u2019t going to offer to take 3 other kids with her. Her money should be for her and her kids.", "They\u2019ve been divorced 10 years and their youngest is 10. OP has a 9 yo with the new wife\u2026", "*Insert gif of Woody Harrelson drying his tears with a wad of cash here*", "It\u2019s considered a change of circumstance. If he got a raise it would change also. In most states you can only revisit CS allocation every 2 years or if there is a change of circumstance.", "He doesn\u2019t have to prove that he\u2019s using the money on his children. You can\u2019t dictate how the money is spent. It can be used to pay rent or groceries or junk food, booze, smokes, and movies. There\u2019s no rule or follow up as to how CS gets spent. \n\nWhich can be maddening when you pay CS and then still have to cover all the basics because the other home is applying support to everything but actually caring for the kids .", "His post says he has the kids every weekend.", "Saying he things she is being spiteful doesn't have to be rude he Is just putting suspicions on the table, also just to clarify I do not think he is handling the situation in the best way at all but that doesn't make him an asshole imo.", "The math doesn't math well for him \ud83d\ude02", "Chances that OP was cheating = 95%", "I was scrolling to see how soon we were noticing those numbers. OP is such an AH for the subject of the post, but likely has plenty of other AH behaviors under their belt.", "At least he had the decency of not asking her CS. Cause he wouldn't use it on their children.", "Chances that he knocked up his now wife while the now ex was preggers: 85%"]}
