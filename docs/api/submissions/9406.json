We didn\u2019t know they would be here and made no plans, but after dinner they showed up at our home at 10:10pm.\n\nWe live on a dark street with a winding driveway that only faces our garage. We were already upstairs watching a movie and didn\u2019t see them drive up. BIL called my husband but his phone was on silent and he didn\u2019t see it until 20 minutes later. By then, they had already left, but he asked if he should call and tell them to come back. I said absolutely not - I had to wake up today at 6am for work and they would have come in, had a drink, and probably stayed until 12am. The house was kind of messy and I was already in PJs. \n\nPlus, I\u2019m tired of them showing up unannounced. They do it randomly to \u201csurprise\u201d us (like they\u2019re doing us a favor) and expect us to feed them and play the top hosts but don\u2019t reciprocate. They also get mad when we\u2019re not available to host them in the name of family. Of course, BIL called my husband and yelled for 20 minutes today about how we shunned them. He said that family should always be welcome and they would welcome us if we showed up unannounced (we never have). They hung up angry and now my husband is upset with me, saying it would be easier to just let them come in for an hour next time.

If it makes you feel better, my MIL used to have the same issue with her family. We repeatedly told her she didn\u2019t have to answer the door at night simply because they showed up. It finally stopped when one time they showed up after 9 and kept knocking. She looked out the curtain at them, they saw her looking and waved, and she cut the porch life off and went back to bed. Told me she was singing keep on a knocking but you can\u2019t come in.\n\nShe gained self-respect that night and they didn\u2019t try that anymore.", "NTA- It was 10pm. They had no reason to assume that you were in a mood or position to entertain. Furthermore **nobody** is entitled to *your* space and *your* time. \n\nThe fact that BIL called to YELL at your husband over this makes it overwhelmingly clear that you need to stop capitulating to their BS and don't allow them in unless they give you notice. They're going to try to walk all over you in more ways than one if you keep letting them do it.", " NTA who shows up at 10:10pm unannounced??  So rude.", "NTA. Showing up unannounced is an asshole move. Showing up at 10pm unannounced is exponential asshole.", "NTA your husband needs to grow a spine. It's incredibly rude to show up at someone's house on a workday at 10pm and unannounced. Doesn't matter if you are Jesus himself. Call ahead and make plans.", "NTA. Someone shows up at my door at 10pm on a work night, I\u2019m not answering either. Personally I\u2019d test their reciprocity\u2014at 10pm on a work night. Or if they\u2019re night owls, surprise breakfast!", "NTA. \n\nMy mom has an open door policy for her kids. She loves it when we just show up. \n\nI have a call before you show policy. I hate it when people just show up. \n\nMy mom calls me. Because it\u2019s not about *faaaaaamily*, but courtesy and basic respect.\n\nEdit: Sounds like your real problem is your husband. He needs to get on board with this very basic and common boundary and be a team with you. Asking BIL to give advance notice on planned visits is crazy basic, you\u2019re not asking for anything even remotely unreasonable. But now two grown ass men are trying to convince you that you are? Nah. \n\nI would bet good money hubs and BIL have talked about this and hubs said something like, \u201cWell, you know how she is\u2026\u201d or \u201cwell, I don\u2019t mind but the wife\u2026\u201d, and thus BIL will never take you seriously. \n\nHusband needs to fortify and lay down a solid boundary with BIL and make it clear either it\u2019s respectfully followed or they\u2019re not welcome at all anymore.", "NTA, especially since this wasn't the first time, AND you've asked that they tell you before hand.  \n\nYou and husband should draw a clear boundary, it's unfortunate that drawing boundaries can be so painful sometimes.", "Maybe it's my german genes that scream very loud in crazyness but....\n\n\nNo one... nowhere in the world should make \"suprise visits\" when people usually going to bed and have to work the next morning. Only exception maybe: young college students...\n\nTell your husband he can visit you anytime before 9p.m. for an hour, when you have to work the next day... and he can also tell them to bring food with them and dont show up with empty hands \ud83d\ude04\n\nSpeaking for the entire German Nation: NTA \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA\nIt\u2019s irritating asf when anyone shows up unannounced.", "NTA. Your BIL sounds like a manipulative moocher", "NTA\n\nIt's bad enough to show up uninvited and unannounced. To do that late in the evening? No.\n\nYour husband needs to polish his spine and tell his brother that this isn't appropriate behavior in grown adults. I expect this of teens trying to hang out, or kids, not adults.", "NTA\n\nThis feels like a no brainer, but yeah.  Showing unannounced is pretty much universally accepted as rude.  It's even ruder for them to just expect you to host.  And don't even get me started on that whole \"BuT FaMiLy\" thing.", "NTA, you can clearly set a boundary of them having to call and ask if they can come over. you also could show up to their place uninvited if you want to.", "NTA but I think your husband is a bit of one. Firstly, he should have hung up the moment his brother started getting angry. Never put up with that. Secondly, don't pander to them ever, so screw letting them in next time. It will never be for just an hour, but you know that. Finally why hasn't your husband grown a spine and put a stop to this idiotic behaviour. A bucket of cold water over them while they are standing at the door might cure this disease.", "NTA I\u2019d hate this", "NTA but your BIL and SIL sure are.", "NTA. Family is important but that this doesn't mean they can show up at anytime they want.\n\nIt's their Risk to just show up. You cannot expect somebody to have to phone available 24/7 and host guest. They could have called earlier and asking if it's ok to visit. They choose to not do this. \n\nMy wife and I have a sign at the Door: Friends are welcome anytime, Family need an appointment. ;-)\n\nIn addition if you need to wake up at 6:00am you should get some sleep.", "NTA. If you are showing up unannounced at my door at 10:10 PM, it better be the either best damn news or the worst damn news I have heard all year. Otherwise CALL and show up at a more civilized time.", "NTA. Showing up at someone\u2019s house uninvited is always intrusive and inappropriate, but at 10pm is downright deranged behavior.", "NTA but You and your Husband are not on the same page. It's best to talk through this and explore what you both can tolerate and what is not negotiable.", "Hell no, NTA\n\nIt is the height of rudeness to show up unannounced at ANY time, much less after 9:pm.   \n\nYour BIL is a self entitle ass who has no manners and yells at his brother because of his entitlement.  \n\nHow about family that treats each other with respect and acts like civilized people and calls ahead with several hours notice, and mentions that they'll be in the area and asks  \"are you up for some company tonight?\"  \n\nSometimes the answer is, \"yes, sure, come on over\",  and sometimes the answer is \"No, not tonight, let's try next week.\"  \n\nThat's how civilized people usually do it.", "NTA! Showing up after 10pm during the week is rude af and inconsiderate. Your hubby needs to grow a spine and tell them they're welcome only when you are all ready to receive them.", "You're NTA. It's rude enough to show up unannounced and uninvited in the daytime. But after 10 pm? Way beyond rude. Hopefully your unwillingness to accommodate their entitled behavior will keep them from coming by again.\n\nETA: your husband needs to learn how to do a couple things. First of all, hang up when his rude brother is screaming at him. Second, don't make apologies for not getting out of bed and disrupting the house, causing his wife to miss sleep when she needs to get up early, just because brother wants to unexpectedly drop in at a wildly inappropriate time. Third,  stop blaming you for his brother's petty tantrum and his own failure to stand up for himself and his wife.", "NTA- a man is king of his castle.   allowing someone else to set the rules is not a good precedent.  What\u2019s next? \u201cYou should let me fuck your wife when she looks good.   You should loan me money when you have it.   You should let me wife peg you if she has a sexual kink she wants to try and i don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nHard NTA.", "NTA.   \n\n\nNobody but AHs show up unannounced at 10:00 at night. And your husband is wrong, it would not have been easier. Because you would be exhausted today and they would just keep repeating the same rude behaviors.   \n\n\nAlso BIL needs to swallow his drama a little. Nobody was shunned, you and your husband were in bed. It's normal to have the household buttoned up for the night by 10:00pm. What's *not* normal is your BIL expecting you and your husband to be waiting like Hostess Barbie on the off-chance he and his family show up.", "Your BIL yelled at your husband for already being in bed and missing their call and not telling them to come back? Wtf? \n\nNTA and stand your ground", "NTA!!!  this is not ok without prior and enthusiastic permission.  Don't let them gaslight you into doubting yourself, your reaction and boundaries are completely normal.\n\nTime to have a full-on conversation about what is and is not acceptable, then they can't claim it's a favour to you.", "NTA and show these responses to your husband.", "NTA. If they live two hours away, sounds like they may have been trying to crash for the night.\n\nI actually think the time of day is irrelevant. You don\u2019t just stop by unannounced. The guy obviously has a cellphone and knew he\u2019d be in your area. He couldn\u2019t be inconvenienced for the 20 seconds it takes to send a \u201chead-up\u201d text, but it shouldn\u2019t be an inconvenience for you to drop what you\u2019re doing for an hour to entertain unannounced guests.
