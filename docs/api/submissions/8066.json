He knows how to keep himself in check. \n\nI would say our relationship is mostly based on logical reasoning. And we both knows what we want from each other.", "Just because you were able to make it work together does not mean your BPD didn't have an impact on your relationship.\n\nUnstable and intense relationships are a diagnostic criteria of BPD. It it didn't affect your 17 year marriage in any way at all, then you likely do not actually have BPD", "How fortunate for me that I didn't then.", "Or perhaps OP is pointing out that because she understands his PD and he is clearly in multiple therapy programs, they probably don\u2019t see that as a \u201crelationship issue\u201d and have ways to combat his symptoms that don\u2019t negatively impact their relationship itself. With proper therapy, communication, and compassion\u2014plenty of people with PDs and other disorders can have happy, functional relationships. It\u2019s possible for people with ASPD with the proper therapy to form positive attachments. OP has stated that BF has been in therapy since he was diagnosed, is still in therapy, and that they go to therapy together. \n\n(I.e. I have severe anxiety and my husband has combat PTSD, and while both these items affect our daily lives, any \u201cepisodes\u201d we have aren\u2019t seen as relationship issues but separate things we help each other through. I\u2019m not equating these to PDs, but I feel like there\u2019s a lot of mental health stigma in this thread.)", "Sorry, wanted to say \"glass\"", "He sounds mentally healthier than a lot of people I know. As long as your both happy and safe then there's not much else to talk about.", "With the right help and willingness to work on it, people with BPD can get to a point where they no longer fit the diagnostic criteria of it. You claiming to be a psychiatrist and not knowing that is very \"sus\".\n\nEdit: This is my only comment in this thread, your reply to this seems to confuse me for someone else.", "Are you a psychiatrist? Because you don't get to decide whether my diagnosis from a qualified professional is right or wrong. I have unstable relationships with other people and refuse to get into another relationship because I hate rejection and don't want to take that risk. Years of therapy was concluded with that diagnosis!", "Psychological disorders can be kept under control, not everyone who has a personality disorder is constantly exhibiting symptoms. Some live relatively normal lives with only a few additions to their lives. Personality disorders are some of the most complex illnesses, no two people with the same condition are effected by it in the same way. I find it hard to believe someone who was a therapist would try telling someone after 2 minutes that their diagnosis is wrong without actually having numerous sessions in person.", "I hear what you\u2019re saying but I do think there\u2019s a significant difference between anxiety and PTSD and ASPD", "At which point you no longer have BPD, you *had* BPD.\n\nAnd congratulations on being one in a million, if that really is the case. Actual meaningful improvement in personality disorders is... uncommon to say the least.", "Yes actually.\n\nAnd I didn't say it was wrong. I said if it had no impact on your marriage for 17 years then its probably wrong. Which is a fact based firmly in the BPD diagnostic criteria and also clinical experience.\n\nYou can deal with that information however you fancy.", "I am not and never have been a therapist.", "You call yourself a psychiatrist, but you are doing some real unethical things here by doing arm chair diagnosis and telling people you know their experience better than they do. I have also never heard anyone but you ever make these claims about BPD. So like you're not really doing great in the ethos department here", "There\u2019s no way you\u2019re a psychiatrist lol", "Don\u2019t worry, this person isn\u2019t a psychiatrist. If you check their comment history, they have some pretty severe lapses in critical thinking that just make it implausible that they would be a psychiatrist lol", "I actually did neither of those things.\n\nAny diagnosis inferred from what I have said is being done by the other commenter herself. I have not told her what she does or does not have - only what situations would strongly suggest she doesn't have BPD.\n\n>I have also never heard anyone but you ever make these claims about BPD.\n\nAnd how many inpatient psychiatric hospitals have you worked at?", "Believe what you want, but if you're in my area and get sectioned I'll say hello."]}
