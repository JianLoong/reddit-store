They can set their own boundaries, like not wanting him around, but you will create your own boundaries based on what they say- aka if they don't want him at Christmas, you probably won't come either. \n4. Biggest thing: Do not engage in further discussion about this. Seriously, do not answer text messages, walk away fully from conversations, if SIL knocks at your door, do not answer. Make it very clear that this just isn't a topic that you are interested in, and stick with that. There is zero reason for this to be something that can be debated.

Despite what most people think, therapy can absolutely help.", "That's the thing, its not something you diagnose + most personality disorders are more of an evaluation of behaviors, so you might see someone with a constant need for attention and a general apathy for people around them and as long as thats a short term thing then that will never be narcissistic, but if those behaviours continue for a long time then you can say thats probably narcissism (since a big component of pd's is often that they can't recognize a fault in their ways so they dont make any effort to improve whereas someone who's just a little selfish sometimes might be like \"oh my goodness I dont wanna hurt people anymore I better work on this\")", "More than sil", "\"so she can keep an eye on me\"\n\nWho the f\\*\\*\\* does she think she is?\n\nNTA. Actually quite civil. Too civil for my taste.", "NTA, sounds like she wants a live in nanny who she controls completely.", "NTA\n\nThis person is systematically trying to control you.\n\nStop running errands for them. Stop even pretending to do what they say.\n\nShe will try to manipulate you. She will try to make it seem like the baby is somehow suffering from you having free will. \n\nThese are lies.", "NTA.  SIL sounds a bit strange.  I am surprised that the SIL hasn't sent over OP's maid outfit yet.\n\nI think OP should be giving her SIL a bit more distance for her safety.", "Why does your SIL feel the need to keep an eye on you? You are an adult too, yes? NTA. SIL needs some therapy, maybe she'll sleep better. Weird AF that she's THIS concerned with who you're banging...\n\n\nAlso her actions and subsequent request are very telling. She tried so ridiculously hard to get you single and now is asking you to move in with them & the new baby? LMAO she's trying to con you into being the live-in-help. I promise. This was me once upon a time\ud83e\udd23", "NTA - why is OP's sister trying to get OP under her eye?  Is OP the plan for her free child-care?  Where is sis's husband?", "This will be so unpopular, but ESH. \nSIL for being so pushy and you because you pretend that a lot of things about antisocial personality disorder is a stereotype. This is a complex and hard-to-treat disorder, and whether your SIL watched a ton of True Crime stories doesn't really matter. Statistically, a lot of criminals have antisocial personality disorder, it's a fact.", "youre NTA! she's got a crazy stigma against metal illness. obviously your relationship works for you, and an uncle-in-law isn't even gonna be around her kids that much. i'm sorry she has so little regard for your feelings and your boyfriend. i'm glad you guys have a relationship that works! try to remember that you don't OWE your SIL anything, and whatever she wants from you she should ask for when the time comes. maybe she's taking some pre-natal stress out on you. but no, don't feel guilty, and your relationship has NOTHING to do with your neurotic SIL or her future kids.", "NTA. She's \"trying,\" and thank the force failing, to manipulate you into being her free stay at home baby sitter and help. Stop lying, block her number, and tell your brother in no uncertain terms you're going NC with her toxic ass.", "YTA. What kind of maniac knowingly dates someone with AntiSocial Personality Disorder?", "NTA - while ASPD is concerning what\u2019s more concerning is how your sister managed to make it about her. That\u2019s bizarre. You sound level headed and even stated you have support in place so her behavior comes off a manipulative and invasive.", "Wait a minute.  I thought you said she was your SIL. She sounds like you're mother.  Lol", "NTA, and SIL should really take a good look in the mirror before judging your boyfriend for his diagnosis. She's being extremely manipulative, and it sounds like she's trying to trick you into becoming her live-in nanny. I'd be very wary of her if I were you.", "Because sil is pregnant, she should be able to\n\nChoose your boyfriends \n\nTell you what is best for you (her)\n\nTell you where to live\n\n?????\n\nI would not have left without a \"fuck you and your controlling attitude!\"\n\nNta", "NTA\nShe sounds exhausting", "NTA\n\nYou need to break up with your sister-in-law", "NTA. I think she has a motive.  She wants you to move in so you can be her unpaid nanny. She'll say in lieu of rent you take care of the baby. I guarantee there's a motive.", "NTA, She's not your mom. She's controlling your relationships for one, second her baby should absolutely be her priority in safety and how they're raised but it is not yours, it never was your responsibility to do what she wants you to just because \"it's stressing her out or making things difficult for her\". In fact, you know what it sounds like? It sounds like she's trying to get you to move in with her for free childcare. She gets to have her baby, do what she wants with whoever and will get you to look after her baby often, with no consideration for your life, wants or needs. Your sister in law is the AH here.", "INFO Why did you fake breakup? For 4 months? Is your title incorrect? Are you 12?", "Nta but be careful aspd diagnosis are not given lightly and you may not know the man you are dating at all.", "NTA", "NTA and what? Just what did I read? You SIL wanted you break up with your boyfriend because of ASDP and  apparently you've caused her so much stress that now she wants you under her roof so she can control you even more? Aw hell no. Absolutely not. Nope. Nope. Nope!\n\nOP, she is pushing you waaaaaaay too much. She's not even your mother and she's smothering you. Girl, stay away from your SIL and use the excuse of \"you said I've caused you stress, so I'm removing myself to remove the stress\" and keep her at arms length at least. \n\nThis is a crazy request on her part!", "NTA.  What makes her think she has the right to tell you what you can or can\u2019t do, see only people she approves of, and to keep an eye on you?  She sounds like her pregnancy hormones have triggered some form of mental illness.  Your brother needs to be concerned plus he needs to tell her to back off.  And if your parents are still around they need to keep their eyes on her.", "Definitely NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe probably wants free babysitting.", "Tell her she is going to have a new baby so she really won\u2019t have time to mother you", "Errr wat Nta", "NTA - this sounds like a diabolical and genius plan to get live in help. I feel super sorry for her kid. Sheesh.", "this is sanist bull shit", "not every person with the same diagnosis is the same and it is more harmful to think this way. hope you and your family get the help you need.", "Also I question why she was freaked out so much about your boyfriend unless she expected him around a LOT which wouldn\u2019t make sense unless she expected you around a LOT. . . Hmmmmmm me thinks she wanted a free baby sitter/live in maid/nanny and was getting \u201cstressed\u201d that boyfriend might get in the way", "Hey OP please educate me. I Google aspd and it\u2019s just antisocial. How does that even \u201charm\u201d her kid ?? Your bf doesn\u2019t even wanna interact with the kid right?", "NTA, the solution is easy, stop lying, live your life, and if they keep pestering you, cut them out of it.  For example....\n   \n>  she still wouldn't stop texting me everyday to breakup   \n    \nBlock or mute their number.  If you want to be with your bf, do so, tell your SIL that they have absolutely no say in your relationships, and if they bring it up again, they go into a timeout.  Then stick to it.", "Either way, it's not their business what his PD is. Has he harmed you or anyone you know. Or does he just do impulsive things? there are many things to this that they don't see. SIL needs to back off though, you are free to live your life without her interference.", "How many people has she been in connection with who have ASPD to be \u2018scared of people with ASPD?\u2019 Seems like a generalization and maybe you should be asking you SIL why she has such objections to your bf in particular.", "That's so horrible of her. \nHonestly personality disorders have such a bad stigma. Both me and my husband have BPD and we are way more likely to hurt ourselves than to hurt anyone else.", "NTA my late husband had severe Bipolar disorder as well as BPD and we were together for 19 years. Was it challenging at times, yes but that was only when his family would convince him it was all in his head and he did not need medication. I would leave with our child when those times happened but he would become his normal wonderful self when he would go back to therapy and take his meds. My family never understood or even tried to understand even though our father was bipolar we well, there solution was to completely cut contact which is there right but I could never do because they can have happy lives with the proper support system in place. That being said I did not stand for abuse around my child at all and was not a doormat nor a pushover, if anything I did tough love sometimes too well and had to seek treatment for my own trauma as well. It sounds like your bf has his under control even better than my hubs did and you sound supportive without being codependent so your SIL needs to get her own issues taken care of.", "I said this in response to the person below but I'll add it here: \n\nIt's a legitimate concern to have if they've just started dating. *Lots* of things are legitimate concerns at that stage of the game, because you simply don't know the person and how they handle themselves. \n\nTHREE FUCKING YEARS IN, and with *no* further red flags, it is no longer in any way a legitimate concern.", "\u201cHad\u201d? How?", "Ding! Ding! Ding! Couldn\u2019t have said it better!", "Wait till reddit finds out how much it costs and how long it takes.", "SIL would have had me running at \"to keep an eye on you.\"  \n\nBeing in any way surveilled is the last thing I would want.  \n\nYes, she wants a nanny and she doesn't want OP to have a social life.  I don't think a change of bf would really make a difference to her; there would be something wrong with any man OP was with.", "then why didn't she see it until after she learned about the diagnosis?", "The fact that you have borderline personality disorder makes it even more disheartening that you hold such ableist beliefs about a fellow Cluster B condition. \n\nAnd no, it's not reasonable for her to be worried if the BF hasn't done anything that would suggest he's a threat. If you're worried just on the basis of him having ASPD, then that's just ableist prejudices. OP explained that he's been in therapy several occasions, knows how to manage his symptoms, and they haven't impacted her negatively. There's no cause for concern. \n\nIf you read OP's other comments, SIL practically forced him to disclose his diagnosis, and then bombarded OP with a bunch of manipulative tactics motivated by ableism towards her BF. Even if you think ASPD is reason enough for SIL to be worried, OP still wouldn't be an asshole for not breaking up with him just because SIL wants her to. SIL has no say in OP's relationships.", "There are some you can recover from. BPD is a common one, if you treat it correctly it can go into remission. OCD/PPD as well.", "Indeed. Therapy is useless where the \u201cpatient\u201d doesn\u2019t see a problem. \n\nMoreover something I personally know about is that therapists will refuse to counsel couples where there is abuse and say that it is because therapy will not work or will be counterproductive in that instance.", "No ASPD, look at the comments also. It's quite clear.", "Stop treating her like she's fragile, that's exactly why she seems to think she can control everyone. She needs a reality check. She's the only one stressing herself out by not minding her own business.", "I thought BP was blood pressure", "SMH", "Ok I was very confused I\u2019m glad I saw this comment", "Those are symptoms of ASPD. Just because you have ASPD doesnt mean you have all the symptoms.\n\nThats like assuming all depressed people are suicidal or all psychopaths will be serial killers. Extreme examples maybe, but so is assuming that someone with ASPD is a danger to society. \n\nThat said, even if OPs boyfriend does have all of those symptoms that still doesnt make him a threat. The most important thing for any mental illness is to get it properly diagnosed, receive the most suited treatment, and to know personally how to properly manage it day to day.\nIm not going to make assumptions about the boyfriends status on this. \nHowever, ASPD is often very difficult to diagnose simply because many with the condition don't tend to seek treatment on their own, believing their behaviors aren't objectively wrong.\nThe fact the boyfriend knows he has ASPD and is comfortable sharing with those he cares about may imply he is receiving proper help.\n\nLike all things in life, mental health has nuance. \n\nThere are lots of families with a member diagnosed with ASPD who are all happy and healthy do to proper management.", "The bf has been in regular therapy since he was a kid.  Maybe therapy is actually helpful?", "I find it hard to believe he would be diagnosed with ASPD if his symptoms were mild enough to not cause problems. \n\nFor those interested, the Mayo Clinic\u2019s summary of ASPD is below. \n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353928"]}
