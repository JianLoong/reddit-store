They can set their own boundaries, like not wanting him around, but you will create your own boundaries based on what they say- aka if they don't want him at Christmas, you probably won't come either. \n4. Biggest thing: Do not engage in further discussion about this. Seriously, do not answer text messages, walk away fully from conversations, if SIL knocks at your door, do not answer. Make it very clear that this just isn't a topic that you are interested in, and stick with that. There is zero reason for this to be something that can be debated.

I\u2019m not sure how you reacted initially, but it could have gone a long way to sit down with her and have a long conversation about the realities of ASPD and that not everyone with this condition acts violently. Any relationship with someone who has a PD is riskier than one without, but no relationship is zero risk, and the two of you are actively engaging in risk prevention and management by being in therapy. If she wouldn\u2019t at a minimum stop harassing you to break up after an adult conversation, she is most definitely the asshole. You were nowhere near being an AH when you reacted to sis in any of these situations, I\u2019m just giving sis the benefit of the doubt since most people would initially question their loved one if they were aware of the diagnosis.
