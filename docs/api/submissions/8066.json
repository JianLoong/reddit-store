The only bit which really matters is \"My sister tried to make me move in with her and her husband and I don't want to but she's upset that I won't. AITA?\" To which the answer is no.", "NTA- sounds like she\u2019s trying to strip you of a support system so you can help with her kid.

Where they would have cause for concern for their child?", "Wtf? NTA\u2026SHE IS! A. Shame on her for trying to breakup you n your bf because SHE is scared of him. Not your problem B. Wanting you to move in \u201cso she can watch you\u201d? No she wants a babysitter. You\u2019re an adult. And should be treated as such.

However, you shouldn\u2019t have to hide your relationship because your SIL don\u2019t like it.", "NTA. No is an appropriate answer.  Outside pressure should not be a factor in your decision making.  Do what you think is best for your happiness.", "The Internet says ASPD is antisocial personality disorder.  I am wondering if he said or did something very inappropriate with her for to act like this.  If not, her reaction seems quite strange.  You need to talk to your brother alone.  Personally I think you\u2019re in for a lifetime of heartache living with someone with this disorder.

Of course, you should take your brother and SIL's cautions and concerns into consideration because of the risks when dating someone with Antisocial Personality Disorder. But, the risks are yours to take. Also, she and your brother have every right to protect their child as they see fit. But her telling you to move in with them so that she can monitor who you're see just crosses a line from concern to meddling.  Your SIL is interfering, inappropriately, in your life. It's past time to set boundaries, including that (a) you are an independent adult with the right to your own life and (b) who you date is your business.", "NTA what the hell is wrong with her? I mean, some of my relatives date people I'm not comfortable with, but unless there is obvious abuse going on, I keep my mouth shut.

Also shes causing her own stress by acting like she has the right to a say in your life. Her stress would drop significantly if she would butt her nose out of your business. Id like to add as a sidenote, unless he has specifically done something while you have been together she is being judgmental and controlling. Just because he has a diagnosis doesnt mean hes a bad person or anything of that nature unless he has done something while shes known him.", "Definitely need more INFO.\n\nWHY is she so worried about you?

She\u2019s decided to involve herself more than is necessary. She can\u2019t play victim for that.", "NTA if your SIL managed to make your BF\u2019s PD her problem, it is likely that she is a narcissist. Your BF mental health has nothing to do with her (and viceversa), and yet, she has made her goal to break you up and have you living with her to police your life.

Her behavior is inappropriate. You are not \"stressing her\", her inappropriate obsesion with your love life is causing her stress.  Why would she want you to move in to her home if you cause her stress?

Your SIL is way overstepping resonable boundaries and seems to believe she has a right to treat you as not just a child, but as her child. It maybe best to ask your actual parents to tell her how offensive and inappropriate her efforts to parent you are and point out that she has already  been asked to stop, so her continued efforts to meddle in your love life are a consent violation and harrasment.", "NTA.
