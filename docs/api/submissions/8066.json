They can set their own boundaries, like not wanting him around, but you will create your own boundaries based on what they say- aka if they don't want him at Christmas, you probably won't come either. \n4. Biggest thing: Do not engage in further discussion about this. Seriously, do not answer text messages, walk away fully from conversations, if SIL knocks at your door, do not answer. Make it very clear that this just isn't a topic that you are interested in, and stick with that. There is zero reason for this to be something that can be debated.
