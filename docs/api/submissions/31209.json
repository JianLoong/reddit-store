Beth became a realtor after high school while I went to college. While I was in school she was being mentored by my mother and uncle and went on to become fairly successful. Beth's problem is their money management.\n\nIt became even more apparent that she was horrible about it when I graduated and moved into the city closer to her when I got my job at my current company. Thanks to my savings and my bonuses at work, I was able to buy a small condo instead of renting.\n\nAnyway, her spending habits were insane. Always buying the newest designerwear, or buy the most expensive bottle of wine at the restaurant we went to for dinner, or paying expensive dinners for her clients to celebrate. She does not have a company card and from what I know her company does not reimburse for celebration meals unless it's a big client. Meanwhile, she'd be struggling for rent each month.\n\nIt all caught up to her and she ended up in $15k worth of credit card debt. She came to me because she didn't know what to do. I paid it off for her under the terms that she would control her spending and pay me interest-free monthly. Not only did we shake on it, we wrote up our agreement and signed it with her BF \"Rocky\" and our friend \"Amy\" as witnesses (my big bro brother is a lawyer, his idea).\n\nRocky Amy and I were all out while she was on a work trip. While there I slipped and her BF caught me before I seriously hurt myself. The position we were in apparently looked compromising because the next day, when Beth got back, she went off on me for trying to steal her BF. An old client of hers saw us at the bar we were at and took our picture. She did not believe me or Rocky when we told her what happened. It ended up being a huge fight.\n\nOver a week she sent hate messages egged my car and made complaints about me to work. I almost lost my job until I showed HR the messages I was receiving from her and they confirmed her number was the one who'd been calling.\n\nIt wasn't until Amy got back from her own business trip that it all stopped and Beth believed her. She tried to apologize but I refused to talk to her after everything. Since I won't forgive her, she decided she no longer owes me the remaining $10k.Furious and heartbroken over how Beth treated me I took my bro's advice and brought her to court. With the agreement we signed, the evidence in the text messages, the reports from work, the judge sided with me and ordered her to pay me the remaining money. The judge said I should consider criminal charges for the harassment and vandalism.\n\nNow Beth's family and some of our other friends have been telling me I shouldn\u2019t have taken her to court before trying to work it out with her. Her mother told me that it was my fault because \"I knew what she was like\" and should have expected this. Her father even showed up at my house. These are people I consider my second family.\n\nI don't know what to do and I'm so emotionally exhausted.

You signed a contract with witnesses, and 10k is not a small amount of money. She doesn't get to decide not to pay you back just because she (incorrectly) thinks you were trying to steal her boyfriend, and almost getting you fired and spreading rumors on top of that? Show her the same courtesy she showed you: none at all. Get your money back.", ">  \"I knew what she was like\" and should have expected this.\n\nso they're saying that you made a mistake by *trusting their daughter?*\n\nNTA, block them, get restraining orders on her and her parents, get a ring camera if you don't have it already so that if they come back you have proof, and press charges. *She tried to get you fired*. She already burned the bridge AND went nuclear.", "NTA. It's sad, but your friendship was over when she thought you were involved with her bf. The harassment, the vandalism, the refusal to pay: this is who she is. It's an unsettling discovery, but it's also the truth. \n\nI don't think for one second she would have paid you back if you didn't take her to court, which is why she and her family are upset about it. If she had every intention to pay you back, the judgment would mean nothing because it would just reinforce what she was already planning to do. \n\nShe fucked up here, not you, and forgiveness is not a requirement. I really despise that idea that you have to automatically forgive people who have done you wrong. There was damage done, and just letting things go lets those wounds fester. Mourn the friendship but know that you haven't done anything wrong. Life just sucks sometimes. People too, as evidenced.", "NTA \n\nThat is a lot of money she still owes you. Of course you deserve to be paid back and it's really not your problem that this friendship went south. I agree with the judge. She is trying to maliciously destroy your life.", "NTA- I don\u2019t understand how she trusts you enough to help her get out of 15k debt but not enough to believe that picture might\u2019ve been taken out of context. Then going so far as to risk your livelihood, and damaging your car without having all of the facts? Clearly this isn\u2019t someone who would\u2019ve have been reasonable enough to resolve the issue out of court. Her parents are out of line for even trying to excuse her actions, I think all of them owe you a sincere apology.", "NTA - You should press criminal charges against her too.  If any of your other friends don't like what you did, and are OK with the way she has been treating you, then you need some better friends.  Cut her and the rest of her toxic friends out of your life.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps facing consequences (being held responsible for the debt which she agreed to repay--that agreement was not contingent on staying in the close friendship that existed at the time of the loan--and if you do, as you should, follow up on the advice provided by the judge), will help Beth to learn not to be \"like that\".\n\nShe had the opportunity to do the right thing--to trust that her BF and best friend were telling her the truth instead of vandalizing your property and trying to cost you your job.  After going through all of that, why would you believe that she wanted to apologize rather than further abuse you? It seems more like she wanted to try to find an excuse to avoid repaying her debt. As the saying goes, \"when someone shows you who they are, believe them--the first time\".", "NTA\n\nTake the judges advice and bring the hammer down on her. Tell anyone defending her to go suck a penis.", "Absolutely NTA. What are you supposed to work out and why should you forgive someone who tried to get you fired? You were absolutely correct to not be friends with someone so toxic and to take her to court. If she pays that\u2019s another thing. Part of the reason she is the way she is is because of those family members and friends making excuses for her instead of making her accountable. Good luck getting your money!", "NTA. Hopefully she can grow up and learn from the adulting lesson you just served up to her. In the future, be *very* careful about mixing money and friends. It burned me too; lost a friend over it.", "You do what the court directed you to do and nothing more or less.", "NTA. You made a reasonable decision based on the evidence and the judge's ruling. It's unfortunate that things turned out this way, but you have every right to protect yourself and seek justice. Stay strong and take care of yourself.", "I can see why you're exhausted, but no, NTA.", "NTA she was out of line and you called her on it. Really do consider those criminal charges. She really needs to learn her lesson.", "Oh, honey, if I were dealing with the crap you have been I'd be emotionally exhausted too. It always blows my mind when someone goes off their rocker like this.\n\nTake the judge's advice or at the very least consider a restraining order for her and her family to keep them away from you. Maybe consider staying with another friend/family for a couple of days just to get a break.", ">Her mother told me that it was my fault because \"I knew what she was like\" and should have expected this. Her father even showed up at my house. \n\nAh, the real issue. The parents who spoilt their beloved baby girl and expect the whole world to do the same. Doesn't work like that. You already went above and beyond in paying off her debt. You did the right thing in taking it to court when she refused to pay you the rest back. We're talking over 10k, not a tenner.

Not sure if this was in small claims but even there it could be months.  Filing on her is a way to let her know you're serious and even then she evidently didn't try to work something out with you before the case came up.
