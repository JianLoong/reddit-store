I was ripped to shreds in the comments, and deservedly so. For those who haven\u2019t read the post: I didn\u2019t feel like my stepson was respecting my authority after I imposed overly strict rules upon him. \n\nI\u2019ve had a few people ask for an update, but first, I wanted to clear up one thing. Many people assumed that I took an under privileged kid and put him in a school full of rich kids. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Before we married, he and his mother were very well off. We both have really well paying jobs, the only reason he was in a public school was because the schools in our area are really great. The only reason he was switched to the private school is because it is a STEM school and I thought that would be beneficial to him. \n\nNow on to the update. After reading the comments telling me how horrible of a stepfather I was, I felt sick. This may seem unbelievable but I was genuinely trying to do right by him and I was beside myself realizing that I did more harm than good. My stepson never knew his father, and I jumped at the chance to have that special father/son bond with him. I eased up on many of the restrictions I placed, he no longer has to surrender his phone and while we still do have family time, it\u2019s about once a week instead of every night. He no longer has a bedtime and while his mom follows him on his socials (I do not) I no longer demand this passwords to anything. The only time I have asked him to babysit is in the case of an emergency but surprisingly, now that I\u2019ve stopped, he\u2019s been offering to babysit every once in a while. \n\nAs for the school issue, he is still at the school we switched him too. We had many long talks about this very issue and he ultimately decided to finish out his high school career at the school because, while he missed his friends, he was able to recognize that this new school offered him the best opportunity to get into the college he really wants to attend. \n\nSince all of this, the relationship between my stepson and myself has drastically improved. For his 17th birthday we offered to get him a car and he and I had a really nice time picking out the right one. I\u2019ve taken him to a few basketball games which he loves (and I\u2019ve enjoyed learning about the sport from him). He actually got a girlfriend and came to me for advice about dating which is not something that would have happened before.\n\nI will say this, I am blessed with an incredibly smart, kind and compassionate stepson; Other kids may not have been so forgiving, and rightfully so. I urge other stepparents out there to really listen to their stepchildren instead of automatically trying to take over, you may not be as lucky as I was.", "created_utc": 1677586973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e4qih/update_aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_stepson/", "score": 60, "replies": ["What? AITA did good? An AH turned over a new leaf? Will wonders never cease!\n\nSorry for the snark OP.... congratulations on all the progress. That's really nice to hear a good outcome. \n\nGood on your stepson for being big enough to forgive, and good on you for making the changes.", "How refreshing that someone took advice rather than be defensive and ignore the chance for change! \nSounds like you\u2019ve grown and your stepson has benefited massively! Well done!", "So glad you were wise enough and courageous enough to be able to take the feedback and save this relationship!", "Well done sir! You are a wonderful person. It is never easy to accept harsh advice (internet comments can be extremely brutal).\nHe is lucky to have you as a father. It is understandable that you struggled before, your daughters were too young for you to have the experience of dealing with a struggling teenager.", "This is a great update! Congrats for the 180!", "It\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish! It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re all working together on the same team now. Life gets a little easier & happier when the team starts winning! Thank you for sharing this update.", "I remember your OP and am happy to hear things have turned around for the better! Good on you for taking the time to reflect and grow. If more people would do that, maybe the world would be a better place :)", "Well done, OP! \n\nIt might be worth taking this lesson and making it explicit for *all* your kids/stepkids - you donked up but it came from a place of caring, you sincerely apologised *and changed your behaviour* (that bit's important) and it massively helped! A mistake isn't the end of the world, changing and apologising and owning your mistakes helps!", "Ah. I love a good update like this!"]}
