I was ripped to shreds in the comments, and deservedly so. For those who haven\u2019t read the post: I didn\u2019t feel like my stepson was respecting my authority after I imposed overly strict rules upon him. \n\nI\u2019ve had a few people ask for an update, but first, I wanted to clear up one thing. Many people assumed that I took an under privileged kid and put him in a school full of rich kids. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Before we married, he and his mother were very well off. We both have really well paying jobs, the only reason he was in a public school was because the schools in our area are really great. The only reason he was switched to the private school is because it is a STEM school and I thought that would be beneficial to him. \n\nNow on to the update. After reading the comments telling me how horrible of a stepfather I was, I felt sick. This may seem unbelievable but I was genuinely trying to do right by him and I was beside myself realizing that I did more harm than good. My stepson never knew his father, and I jumped at the chance to have that special father/son bond with him. I eased up on many of the restrictions I placed, he no longer has to surrender his phone and while we still do have family time, it\u2019s about once a week instead of every night. He no longer has a bedtime and while his mom follows him on his socials (I do not) I no longer demand this passwords to anything. The only time I have asked him to babysit is in the case of an emergency but surprisingly, now that I\u2019ve stopped, he\u2019s been offering to babysit every once in a while. \n\nAs for the school issue, he is still at the school we switched him too. We had many long talks about this very issue and he ultimately decided to finish out his high school career at the school because, while he missed his friends, he was able to recognize that this new school offered him the best opportunity to get into the college he really wants to attend. \n\nSince all of this, the relationship between my stepson and myself has drastically improved. For his 17th birthday we offered to get him a car and he and I had a really nice time picking out the right one. I\u2019ve taken him to a few basketball games which he loves (and I\u2019ve enjoyed learning about the sport from him). He actually got a girlfriend and came to me for advice about dating which is not something that would have happened before.\n\nI will say this, I am blessed with an incredibly smart, kind and compassionate stepson; Other kids may not have been so forgiving, and rightfully so. I urge other stepparents out there to really listen to their stepchildren instead of automatically trying to take over, you may not be as lucky as I was.", "created_utc": 1677586973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e4qih/update_aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_stepson/", "score": 4837, "replies": ["What?

Well done!", "So glad you were wise enough and courageous enough to be able to take the feedback and save this relationship!", "Well done sir! You are a wonderful person. It is never easy to accept harsh advice (internet comments can be extremely brutal).\nHe is lucky to have you as a father. It is understandable that you struggled before, your daughters were too young for you to have the experience of dealing with a struggling teenager.", "This is a great update!

A mistake isn't the end of the world, changing and apologising and owning your mistakes helps!", "Ah. I love a good update like this!", "This means so much to me. I\u2019m the other side of this. My husband never turned that leaf. He is now my exhusband but we were together for 20 years. It has had a huge negative effect on my son. Now I coparent with him and he still does the same thing and trigger the kids without being in the house.", "I applaud you for recognizing your wrongs and working on it in a healthy way. I'm glad you did so.", "Being a step parent of a teen is very hard.  I realize I took too much personal when SK was just being a normal teenager.

Learning from your mistakes? Am I really on AITA?  That is an amazing update. I think you two are going to have a great father/son relationship. That is awesome. Good for you for realizing before it was too late that things needed to change and compromises had to happen.", "This was a joy to read!! \ud83d\ude0d Well done for taking on board the feedback you got and implementing real, meaningful change! You are reaping the benefits of being a teachable person and as an added bonus you\u2019ve now shown your step son that he too is capable of big change should he feel he needs to in the future - you have been a great role model in that so honestly you should be proud.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nLook at Reddit out here changing lives \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Awesome job OP.", "That's awesome! Does anyone in your family know about this post?", "Always nice to hear when an asshole reforms themselves- good work man!", "Sometimes people mistakenly take authority for parenting. You learned it the hard way through that sub (those people can be savage but they are good people with experience and a heart well placed) but it was worth it.", "It's either cold in my house or your update gave me chills. I love seeing a positive update. Wishing you and your (step)son the best in your relationship.", "I remember seeing your post a year ago and I was like really can't this dude see how big of an asshole he is? But then seeing and update like this is truly wonderful! All the blessing to you and your family.", "Genuinely well done for listening and changing. I'm a little reluctant to shower you with praise though. You've gone from being a terrible parent to a decent one which is great and hard to do, but there are plenty of decent parents out there who didn't need Internet strangers to show them the error of their ways. You got it so wrong to start that I struggle to believe you've got it all right now so I hope that has taught you to keep a more open mind in general. \n\nThat said, that's good advice for a lot of people including me. Maybe I'm being too harsh, it's definitely amazing that you've changed and made his life so much better.", "WOW, deep congratulations and well done to you. The biggest sign of intelligence both emotional and general is the ability to leave your ego aside and listen and learn.

That\u2019s lovely, may the waters always be smooth.", "Congrats on this rebuilt relationship. Hope you and your son have many years of making happy memories together.", "I am happy OP was able to create a healthy relationship with \u201cT\u201d.

Good on you for taking advice and not digging your heels in. You'd never get these years back.", "I love a good update, well done op!", "Honestly, this made me tear up. I\u2019m so glad that you actually took in what others said to you and changed. It takes a big person to sit their child down and actually apologize. I commend you for that. I wish your family nothing but the best!", "Congrats on strengthening and repairing your relationship with your stepson!", "Wow, and here I thought we usually did really bad and ruined everything for everyone! \n\nGood job, sounds like you guys are on your way to a fantastic (step)father-son relationship!", "I'm glad the dad could learn and stop breaking bad.", "Bravo! Self-reflection is always a good thing. \ud83d\udc4d", "I'm so happy to hear that things improved. You might consider writing out your thoughts as a letter for your stepson - maybe for high school graduation or another big celebration.

You did good! \u2764\ufe0f", "Great job taking on this advice & doing your best by him.

The fact that he came to you for dating advice is a massive deal- that he values and trusts your opinion. Wonderful!", "I'm glad to see that you jumped on it before the damage was irreversible and really worked on it. The changes made were so beneficial to you both. That's a great update, and bodes well for your future. Congratulations to you both for working to have a real relationship that's now based on respect.", "The number one reason good children act out is because they don\u2019t feel heard.. sometimes all you need to do is sit down and listen to your child..", "This actually rocks! So nice to see an OP genuinely take some advice (after sifting through quite a bit of vitriol I\u2019m sure lol)", "It's refreshing to see that you took the advice and that you truly wanted things to get better.  I'm glad your stepson has forgiveness you and that your relationship has improved. \n\nWhen you know better, you do better. You're doing better and that's a very good thing. May your relationship continue improve..", "This is such a wonderful, refreshing update it seems hard to believe that Reddit made it happen. Super happy to hear this, OP, and really glad you guys have both been able to start fresh.", "This is so relieving to hear (read?).

It\u2019s not often someone here actually listens to advice given in the comments, so it\u2019s nice to know that at least one person does care about mending their mistakes and improving themself.

I wish you and your stepson a healthy, happy relationship.", "It's never easy being a step parent.. it has different challenges from being a standard parent .. but you learned from your mistakes which is always good to see .. so many try to double down and make it worse", "I am so glad you turned things around.", "This melts my heart, I'm so glad for you OP!", "My stepdad is controlling to the point Ive not been able to live with him for ages, which really sucks because he's a great guy and I like him when I dont have to abide by his batshits rules. I cant tell you how much it means to your stepson that you are backing off and that you are listening to his needs. Great job OP.", "Well done, OP. I hope you have many, many wonderful years with your stepson and the bond you've built.\n\nCriticism can be really tough to hear and accept, especially from a group of random folks in a reddit thread. Good on you.", "Awww well done you guys - that's the positive story I needed this week :)", "I'm so happy to hear so, OP :)\n\nI'm confident your relationship with your step son will develop even further into a great one, based on mutual respect and acceptance. \n\nIt's so good when we find the error of our ways and do the hard task of turning things around, it's cleansing, refreshing, it reflects personal growth and nothing makes me happier than seeing people enjoy positive change.\n\nThis stranger is inexplicably proud of you. Way to go!\nBest wishes.", "When I read your old/first post about what you did to your stepson, I still see red.\n\nBut I am happy, that you figured it out, somehow.", "Well done, now you are a respectable parent. I'll not say he is an \"wonderful person\" or anything because I don't think we should praise ppl that much just for not doing bad things to their childs, but OP improved A LOT, congrats", "I'm glad to see Reddit making positive changes for people's lives", "I LOVE THIS!!!!", "Congratulations on being able to use the criticism to improve, it's very hard to recognize your own mistakes and very brave to accept them and change.", "Glad to see this update, and glad to see that despite everyone raking you over the coals you decided to do some self-reflection rather than stubbornly sticking to what you'd been doing.\n\nKudos to your son as well, for realizing that the school he's in now is better for his future than the one his friends are at.  Not many teenagers would show that level of maturity and stay with the school their friends weren't at.", "Now this proves that you are not an AH! You were genuinely interested in the outcome of the post and worked to better yourself, something true AH would mever do. I'm happy to hear everything worked out!", "Heartwarming update! Huge kudos to you for doing the hard emotional work. It couldn\u2019t be easy and it sounds like you did it without expectation of your stepson\u2019s forgiveness or a future bond. I think that restraint on your part allowed him the space to bond with you after all. Sometimes we look at a situation with the wrong viewpoint, but a good person is willing to see the error and try to fix it. Again kudos to you!", "Proud of you! Most parents wouldn't even give a shit but coming to AITA to get the brutal truth about your parenting is already a sign that you always wanted to do the right thing. Good job!", "Well that made me cry. So happy to see everything working out for you both.", "My stepmom and I had a really, really rough start as well for the first few years. I\u2019m so grateful we were able to turn over a new leaf the way you and your stepson have, because now she\u2019s 100% the mother I never had.

You did right by your stepson and yourself and that is something to be proud of \u2665\ufe0f it couldn\u2019t have been easy reading all those comments but you put your ego aside and you did what needed to be done to build a healthy relationship with your stepson and make sure he feels safe and respected in your home and in return he now respects you so I\u2019m super happy for you both!", "Amazing update \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "This makes me so happy \ud83e\udd79", "The most beautiful post I've seen in AITA, OP really wanted to change for the better and put in action.

They ripped up a new asshole on your original post (which you deserved, of course) but I know it couldn't have been easy to hear since you genuinely didn't seem to have had ill intentions. Unfortunately, a lot of people react badly to such harsh criticism to the point that they'll shut down and get super defensive instead of asking themselves why their actions have caused such a strong reaction with so many people. But you seem to have bucked that tend and accepted that you were in serious need of some outside perspective and self reflection, which I can certainly respect. Good for you! \n\nI gotta say, the fact that your stepson was so readily willing to forgive after getting treated so poorly for 2+ years by you is a real testament to his good character. He sounds like a very kind hearted and intelligent young man that any parent would be proud of. It's so good that you were finally able to recognize that before the relationship was too damaged to be repaired. And the fact that he's offering to babysit now that he's not being forced into it tells me that he really is a sweetheart. I hope you keep up the good work cuz if you do, I'm sure this relationship will continue to flourish and grow into a familial love and bond. \u263a\ufe0f", "Ahhh im so happy for all of you!! Good job OP", "Proud of you OP. It is really easy when people tell us we are wrong to shut them out and ignore it.

I have stepparents myself and having them respect and value me as my own person made all the difference. Well done!", "There should be a special category of posts for ex-AHs, or graduated from AH to decent person.", "I totally understand the snarky comment. Every time I read a post where someone is oblivious to their shitty behavior, I always wonder if they actually take people's advice. Do they actually read the comments?

I guess, try to imagine yourself at his age and what your father or mom were trying to do.  I am sure social media wasn't the issue then, but the internet and gaming might have.

Who'd have thought! (Seriously, well done for admitting your mistakes and learning from them.)", "This was so lovely to read. OP, you\u2019re a good person. You realised your mistake, learned from it and took appropriate actions to rectify it. It sounds like you and your stepson are now forging a beautiful relationship that both of you can be proud of. Congratulations, and I wish you and your family all the best!", "What a wonderful update, OP! Made me smile :)", "Wow huge recovery OP", "This is such a sweet update. Thank your for sharing it!", "glad to hear it!!", "Truly refreshing. Currently dealing with my father over stepping boundaries, who I know will never learn the error of his ways, and this post was extremely refreshing. Thank you OP for showing that some people are capable of listening and changing for the better. Hats off to you!", "I like the ones that ignore 300 AH verdicts and say \"thank you for understanding\" to the 1 (1)  person in the comments who agrees with them", "OP apologized and stuck to the changes! Words and actions are very important. Apologizing was absolutely the right thing to do, but more importantly was making the changes that warranted the apology in the first place. OP\u2019s doing some good work out there!", "I second this.", "r/bestofredditorupdates is a good source for consolidated updated posts, across all subs, but aita is featured heavily. They aren\u2019t all AH to decent human stories but some are.", "r/BestofRedditorUpdates might be a worthy commendation.", "That would be so cool! I love this idea!", "You mean, a REAL  \"best of\" redditor updates sub", "I have gotten a couple of private messages from OP's on AITA thanking me specifically for commenting. It makes it worth trying to react to things in as compassionate and informative a manner as I can. Sometimes people really just don't understand, and it's nice to know some of them listen. (When the advice is good).", "Well it's 50% that and also 50% the fact that comments on AITA can be insane and not really help the OP improve their behavior at all lol\n\nThankfully this was a pretty cut and dry post where OP just needed to be clearly told how they were being a bad person, and good on OP like you said for actually improving", "Absolutely! It's a great opportunity for a positive example, especially for the younger kids, is all - I think behaviour like this should be spread far and wide \ud83d\ude09", "AssholesInRecovery", "A flare for sure", "Compassionate and informative is very important. Sometimes the comments are so harsh. It can be deserved, but sometimes it isn\u2019t.", "Yeah, that makes total sense. Makes them less defensive because yur actually helping them with a solution.\n\nI just get really concerned when there are all of these awarded comments and the OP doesn't respond to any of them. I wonder if they're thinking, \"They didn't agree with me so I'm not gonna say anything to further incriminate myself.\" And it's especially frustrating for me when OP is a parent who's blatantly being an AH to their kid(s). It always worries me that they're not going to change. But in THIS instance, I'm really glad OP came around.", "Yus.  Some posts are just fishing vor validation (or maybe karma), but I would like to believe that at least some of the people who specifically ask for/invite feedback on a subject in their lives by posting in AITA, are also people who are genuine in their intention to receive such feedback in seeking outside perspective.  But even the best advice or feedback is more likely to fall on deaf ears if it is delivered without any compassion or without a path to take that feedback and *do* something with it.", "I\u2019d like to propose Asshole Success Story lmao", "Reminds me of ps5 dad and his username that was like not the ahole after all.", "I don't find there's very much use in criticism on a personal level if it doesn't also offer potential alternatives.  We should always strive to be better than we have been, that's the purpose of recognizing our faults. As part of my personal growth, I'm trying to be a more positive presence for others as well, and that means more listening than it does speaking most of the time. It's nice to know it works sometimes!", "It often doesnt matter if the harshness is deserved or not. Often its not help full if you want the Person to Listen and change. But that is something a Lot commenters are not interested in.", "Because the awarded comments are often are written in a way that they resonate with the audience not with op. And beyond it you often have a Lot of insulting comments.", "If you do make it, drop the join link :P", "Yeah, that's absolutely true. Good points.", "Here you go\n[The Subreddit in question ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NotTheAssholeAnymore?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)", "I occasionally see a lot of downvoting when people think I'm not being harsh enough. But people tune out when you insult them. If you're at the point where you're calling each other names (other than asshole),  you're usually past the point where meaningful discourse is going to occur. That's people who just want to take their aggro out on someone, not someone who is interested in talking it out.", "The birth of a subreddit! \u2764\ufe0f", "I am forever keeping this on my clipboard.
