Sorry for my bad english.\n\nI live in a apartment complex; the parking lot has a terrible entrance: in order to exit the parking lot you have to traverse a small tunnel ( about 4-5 m long). A car is barely able to pass through the tunnel. A tow truck cannot.\n\nA couple of days ago my neighbor came to knock at my door. I barely know him but he seemed like a kind person the few times I talked to him. He told me that he car was broken and asked if I could help him bring it to the other side of the tunnel, so that a tow truck could come and pick it up. I said sure. \n\nMy cousin was with me at the time, so he came to help too. We pushed the car until the end of the tunnel and left it on the side of the road in a point where the road gets larger. The neighbor thanked us and we parted.\n\nThe next day her wife came to knock at my door. She initially thanked us for helping his husband but then she started scolding us when she found out we left her husband alone. Apparently the man suffered a heart stroke few weeks ago and he is not supposed to be left alone for prolonged period of time. I didn't know this. He looked like a healthy man in his late 40s and he said nothing to us. We explained this to her and she said that even if we didn't know that, we should have stayed with him. What if the tow truck had problem picking up the car? What if he had to move the car again? \n\nI tried discussing with her for a few minutes but to be sincere I had no strength to argue so I simply said I was sorry and dropped the whole thing. \n\nNow I'm curious though.

For what it\u2019s worth, while she shouldn\u2019t have put that on you, it sounds like she\u2019s just a natural worrier who\u2019s husband is vulnerable and maybe she\u2019s having a hard time coping.\n\nSometimes, the loved ones of people who\u2019ve experienced sudden medical emergencies like that will try to find someone to blame because if there\u2019s nobody at fault, then they\u2019re at the mercy of whatever reality brings with it.

How were you to know this?\nA) the guy never told you this\nB) the guy could have waited inside until the tow truck came\nC) if his wife was so concerned, she could have dropped everything and stood with him since they are married for christ\u2019s sake", "NTA She was way out of line. There is no way you could have possibly known without him telling you. Besides, you didn't have to help and you did anyway. Understandably, she's thinking about the health and welfare of her husband, but people have places to go. She's either an ingrate or projecting her worries about him onto you. Either way, she's the one in the wrong.", "NTA; you helped a stranger and that's A Good Thing^(TM). This person never told you that he had a medical condition; how could you _possibly_ be responsible for him?", "NTA he is a grown man. He was clearly going to go  out for period of time without her. He also could have left the car and gone back in his home until the tow company came and called him.\n\nHe also could have called his wife, family, friends other people if he needed help.\n\nIf he thinks his health was more important then at any point all he had to do was lock the car and go. So what if he gets a ticket - his health is more important and it was no longer obstructing the road.\n\nAnd no - no one would stay with someone else after pushing the car. Unless it was a disabled or elderly person or maybe someone with a baby and they were all far from home.", "NTA. You don't know what you don't know. His wife is worried, I get it, but she's also being quite silly.", "NTA - you did what he asked, you don't have any obligations. Unless it's a child.", "NTA. You helped this person and his wife expects you to read his mind and know he has a health condition? If he wanted you to wait around he would have asked. \nYou did a nice thing, the wife is definitely the asshole in this scenario", "NTA. \n\nIf she wants to hire you as a babysitter, she needs to start by discussing how much she'll pay you for your time. Otherwise, you're going to assume an adult is either ok to take care of himself or is able to ask for help on his own.", "NTA, it's on her, as his wife, to tend to his neds, not on you - a random stranger who happened to live near by", "NTA! You kindly helped someone as rep quested. You did something nice and typically that doesn\u2019t involve guessing someone\u2019s medical history with accuracy, then acting upon it. Just saying", "Nta.  You're not responsible for babysitting a grown ass man. & she's fucking delusional.  She's just worried about his health & fraught with the idea something could've happened & nobody would've been around.\n\nWhen you see him ask about the car (hopefully he'll give a short answer, as you're not friends). When you see her, ask how he's doing (try to sound interested (she's less likely to give a short answer, but in the long run its better than having her delusional ass mad at you).\n\nIn the future, confirm a tow truck has been called & is on the way before moving a car. In my area, they say it'll be 1hr, so it's nice to know they're already in the process (as opposed to pushing the car & then waiting 1hr). Once you've pushed the car, ask if they need anything else.  An adult is perfectly capable of communicating their needs & if not well, \"a closed mouth don't get feed.\"", "NTA. You didn't know of this man's medical condition, and it doesn't seem that he asked you to stay with him. I'm sure the wife was concerned but she shouldn't take that out on you.", "NTA. You helped him, and he was fine with that. \n\nHis wife might be worried for him, but she should talk to her husband about always having someone with him.", "NTA. You only know what you know.  You did what was asked.  You didn't see anything alarming.", "NTA and the wife is a huge asshole. You helped out a neighbor. You had no way of knowing this and even if you did it is not your responsibility to look after the husband. Where was she when this went down?  He was already alone when the event started.
