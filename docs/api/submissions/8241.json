Sorry for my bad english.\n\nI live in a apartment complex; the parking lot has a terrible entrance: in order to exit the parking lot you have to traverse a small tunnel ( about 4-5 m long).

I barely know him but he seemed like a kind person the few times I talked to him. He told me that he car was broken and asked if I could help him bring it to the other side of the tunnel, so that a tow truck could come and pick it up. I said sure. \n\nMy cousin was with me at the time, so he came to help too. We pushed the car until the end of the tunnel and left it on the side of the road in a point where the road gets larger. The neighbor thanked us and we parted.\n\nThe next day her wife came to knock at my door. She initially thanked us for helping his husband but then she started scolding us when she found out we left her husband alone. Apparently the man suffered a heart stroke few weeks ago and he is not supposed to be left alone for prolonged period of time. I didn't know this. He looked like a healthy man in his late 40s and he said nothing to us. We explained this to her and she said that even if we didn't know that, we should have stayed with him. What if the tow truck had problem picking up the car? What if he had to move the car again? \n\nI tried discussing with her for a few minutes but to be sincere I had no strength to argue so I simply said I was sorry and dropped the whole thing. \n\nNow I'm curious though.

There was no way to know that he had a recent medical issue and even if they did, they were under no obligation to sit with the guy and wait for the tow truck.  If he were that bad, then perhaps the guys wife should have stayed home to be with him.", "NTA - you did a kind thing and helped him move the car to a safe place from which the car could be collected.  Nothing more could have been expected of you. If you had the extra information, you may have waited but that was because that information changed the scenario. You can't be expected to know things you weren't told. \n\nAnd unless your neighbour had an immediate heart attack, he knew where you lived and had felt able to ask you for help before. If they needed help when the tow truck arrived, reasonable to assume he'd ask again.", "No \u2026.it's that simple. Not you monkeys, not your circus.", "This woman is crazy and entitled. NTA.\n\nHow could you have known. Furthermore how much do you have to do before your good deed is done? We\u2019re you supposed to spend the whole day with him and tuck him into bed in order to prevent a million different what if\u2019s? Also she\u2019s just crazy. Who berates the person that helped them out?", "NTA,\n\nYou're not telepathic, you had no way of knowing this.", "NTA; you did a kind thing by helping your neighbor. How were you supposed to know that he had just had a heart attack? And moreover, (not saying this is a nice thought...) how is it your responsibility to babysit him after the fact?", "Nta\nYou are not a nanny", "I bet you anything that man desperately wants some alone time and she won't let him because she's worried. NTA there was no way you could have known any of that he's a grown man and it's a reasonable expectation that he doesn't need a baby sitter. Suggest one of those old people fall alerts next time you see her.", "NTA. Nobody expects that an adult man who apparently is in good health needs a chaperone. Guy didn\u2019t ask for help so there is no reason for anyone to expect it.", "NTA\n\nyou were asked for help and provided it - no reason to think an adult needed babysitting too.   \nif the neighbours wife ever mentions it again tell her you understand that she requires potential helpers to go above and beyond regardless of the information provided and since this is obviously unreasonable -  please to never ever ask for your help again because it  won\u2019t be given - just in case she decides what ever help you do offer is not enough.", " \n\nI get really awkward when the task is completed and someone lolligags around.", "She's either an ingrate or projecting her worries about him onto you. Either way, she's the one in the wrong.", "The overprotective demanding of total strangers thing has never made sense to me", "Right when my next door neighbor's truck was getting towed he was at work and only his mom was home so I went and helped her unload his work supplies out of the truck that he needed because she couldn't lift them all. He would've done it himself but completely forgot about and I was happy to help because they help me with random things to, I like good relationships with my neighbors, though my otherside neighbors that's a different story but I'm still cordial lol.", "I know of what you speak. Great neighbors are hard to come by. We got incredibly lucky when we moved to where we are.", "NTA. She is out of her mind.", "One thing is help and another to solve their problems......", "If you didn't tell the wife to go and fuck herself then you're a bit of an arsehole for not standing up for yourself.", "Not the asshole. If it were I in that situation I would have apologized and stated I was unaware, and after she continued berating me I would have have apologized again and assured her that it would never happen again. Because I would never help them with anything ever again. Close door in face...", "How is this near stranger your responsibility and not the wife\u2019s? NTA.", "NTA she should be scolding her neighbor not you.", "NTA\n\nThe neighbour was alone when he asked for help - where was his wife then?\n\nOP doesn't know this guy or his medical history but even if he did, OP isn't responsible for providing medical supervision for him. OP has a life and it doesn't revolve around a neighbour he doesn't know. The wife is deluded.\n\nIf it were me, I would have told the wife that I was not responsible for her or her husband and that I would not help them again.", "There's a saying: No good deed goes unpunished. I've been in your shoes where I put myself out there to help others and end up in a whole imbroglio with a random. \n\nBut! I bet the wife is feeling scared and nervous for her husband. She still had no right to try and place blame on you. I'm sure he'd be embarrassed if he knew. Just know you did a kind deed and were, as it goes, routinely punished- so now it's done. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHow could you have known?!?", ">Apparently the man suffered a heart stroke few weeks ago and he is not supposed to be left alone for prolonged period of time. \n\n\"My skills include being able to help push a car, not telepathy\"\n\n>What if the tow truck had problem picking up the car?\n\n\"Then he should call another tow truck, I would assume.\"\n\n>What if he had to move the car again? \n\n\"I'm assuming he's a function adult that can make alternate arrangements.  Even if he isn't he isn't my responsibility.\"\n\n>She initially thanked us for helping his husband but then she started scolding us when she found out we left her husband alone. \n\n\"I don't agree with your logic, but assuming I do the if he is so fragile, and you have all this knowledge about his needs, where were you?  How could you heartlessly leave him alone in his time of need?  I don't even know the man, but you're his wife.\"\n\nNTA", "That\u2019s pretty dumb. The tow truck guy knows how to handle cars. If it needs to be moved the tow guy is THE guy to help move the car again. At the same time that was better than not helping at all. People got places to be and things to do. Lady is out of her gourd.", "NTA, and to add on, the wife was looking for someone for someone to argue with. When OP have a sensible answer, she kept pushing him", "I was halfway through changing a tire when a guy pulled over to help. \n\nTold him I was good, and he just\u2026 stood there watching me. Told him \u201cReally man, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nJust\u2026 stood there, watching me work. \n\nI eventually told him I wasn\u2019t going to give up and ask for help, he wasn\u2019t getting money or ass for pulling over, and to fuck off. \n\nBoy, he thought that was awfully rude of me.", "Of course nta.  Ask wife how in the hell she could leave him alone long enough to die, when she KNOWS he is ill.", "Not the asshole - you helped - you have your own life to tend to.", "NTA. He\u2019s not your responsibility and your not his babysitter. She needs a reality check.", "The road courtesy usually is indeed to wait you're probably young from the look of that post. But its like manners in public transport or table manners only a few really respect it...", "Thank two guys for helping her husband by berating them?  That only makes sense to a crazed spouse.", "NTA. The audacity this woman has to be mad at you is beyond me. You and your cousin were so kind to help. She was probably putting her own stressors on you. I would've done the same thing as you.", "Probably one of those people that goes on and on repeating the same thing, won't let the \"conversation\" die and forces you to interrupt to explicitly end the conversation.", "Why was he alone and DRIVING A CAR if he could collapse at any moment? Does he not have a phone?", "You cant really believe that needing a hand makes someone an asshole, plus they werent forced, just asked  \nBut gosh reading your comment gives me no hope for the world if you think helping someone is such a heavy burden", "Yeah, seeing as it was so recent she was probably just worried and unfortunately took it out on you. Maybe she was trying to not give him a hard time because stress is bad for him, and it just kind of bottled up inside her and landed on you.", "Okay to volunteer, NOT okay to gripe that neighbors didn't do your personal chores.", "Being ungrateful for the help received makes the AH.", "So wife stays home, but neighbors MUST watch ger husband???", "NTA and this is why I am wary of helping people, because once you do help someone they expect way too much.", "NTA. What are you supposed to be, a mind reader????", "To be honest, I don't like leaving people who are alone with car trouble either. Of course, this is dependent on where they are. Middle of nowhere? Nah, I'll just chill with you til it gets sorted. Narrow country highway? I have road lights to put out and I'll wait to pick them up once you're done.\n\nNice big highway with wide breakdown lane, lots of traffic and you're in a highly visible place? If you're good being alone I'm good leaving you alone lol", "NTA as a woman in my 40\u2019s with serious health issues that are no visible my family never leaves me alone or when I go out alone they check on me", "NTA, why would you know that? Dude that woman is off her rocker!", "NTA are you really questioning this?  You don't really know him, you don't know his medical condition, and he didn't once say to you \"hey can you hang out until the tow truck comes?\"", "NTA\n\nYou can't read minds. You didn't know about his health issues.", "Also would like to add that if the car needed to be moved again for the tow.truck to.get it, than the tow truck driver would have helped with that. Got to love entitled people though, how would the world function if it wasn't for them?"]}
