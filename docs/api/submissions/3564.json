She has also been petting/cuddling up to them as you would to a cute little puppy or something. I understand that she loves them and the nicknames are out of love, but again these dogs are not to be treated as pets, they are workers. I explained this to her and told her that if she couldn't understand where I was coming from I really couldn't have her over anymore and we would have to continue to see each other outside of the farm. This made her upset in a sad way. She was really sad when she had left, and I felt bad. I tried to explain my reasoning and side of things to her and even asked my lil sis for some advise, but my sister said that I was the AH here because my gf is just a great person who cares for the animals as much as I do, which is true so I get where she's coming from, but I also need these dogs to stay trained as farm dogs.

I know plenty of people with herding dogs, Livestock Guardian Dogs (LGDs), general farm dogs, and other working dogs of various stripes. All receive PLENTY of love and affection from their owners, and their utility is in no way impacted by that. While LGDs generally spend most of their time with the livestock (though still receiving affection from owners and other humans), other working dogs, and herding dogs in particular, very often are kept in the home at night with the family and loved on and played with extensively.  They are part of the family.\n\nPetting and cuddling your dogs and calling them by silly nicknames does not impact their ability to do their jobs in the slightest.  If your Maremma happens to be struggling with their allocated task of herding, that's because they aren't a herding breed and are generally not good at it- not because your girlfriend happened to give them some snuggles. They lack the needed stamina and herding instincts.
