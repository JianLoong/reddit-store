So I (35M) married my wife (30F) eight years ago. We would usually go abroad for the holidays and spend time as a family (We have two kids). This year, she insisted we should accept her parents' invitation and go see them instead. I agreed.\n\nMy in-laws are actually very lovely people. Our kids were having the time of their lives with their cousins and we got to spend some quality time with family. I realized over the visit that my BIL (I'll call him Jake) is currently dating a woman who works for me (I'll call her Emma). I don't know her well, but I've seen her a few times in my office. I don't really talk about work around family. I like to keep my work and home as separate as possible.\n\nNow as we were all sat down, my MIL asked Emma what it was like to work with me. She laughed and said I was very strict and impatient. I didn't expect an answer like that. I thought she'd just say something cliche and let it go since this is a family event and not somewhere to talk about work. I said we should not talk about this here.\n\nBut my MIL and wife got interested all of a sudden and asked Emma how I was and how I acted at work. She said I was difficult to be around when someone made a mistake and that it was hard to live up to my expectations. She went on to tell quite a few stories from the workplace of how her co-workers were scared or making mistakes around me. I am strict about work yes but I believe I owe my success to that trait. She slipped a quiet comment along the lines of 'you're a jackass' and laughed it off. \n\nTo be clear, I don't yell or fight or act rude at work. I simply have high standards for performance and I do compensate quite well. If someone doesn't live up to those expectations I don't dramatize the situation. So I don't understand why she kept going on like this. And I kept silent.\n\nLater, when I caught Emma alone, I asked her if she really did find working for me as hard and unbearable as she was saying it was. She said absolutely. I said okay then I considered this her resignation since she was so dissatisfied. (I of course wasn't going to terminate her employment over this I wanted to make a point.)\n\nShe panicked and started telling me she was just joking etc. I said I had clear boundaries about work and her violating them even with jokes around family and calling me a 'jackass' was just rude and not something I could accept. She apologized and said she'd keep it to herself. \n\nJake later told me I was unbelievable for how I acted and that proved that Emma was right about me and he worried his sister was being emotionally abused. I love my wife and to even hear him say this based off of how I am at work really saddened me. \n\nDespite all this, I was looking for an objective perspective.

You fished for an apology and lashed out when you didn't get it. Your family pushed her to talk about you and encouraged her to say harsh things, they jeopardized your working relationship for their own amusement.

Teasing is not a resignation. You needed to wait until Monday and address her lack of professionalism appropriately and in a considered manner. Frankly doing otherwise looks to me like you're actually pretty bad at a core function of your job- management.

He'd be crazy not to worry, based on what you just showed him of your temper and your moral character.", "ESH. Emma was unbelievably unprofessional but I suspect there's some reflecting on your way of conducting yourself to do as well.", "ESH. She sucks for saying all those comments in front of family. She could have stopped after her first comment but kept going, and she knew her boss was in front of her. I don\u2019t know about everyone else, but I wouldn\u2019t give examples or call my boss a jackass if he was in the same room. You are an asshole as well. Take this time to reflect on how you manage your employees. You don\u2019t have to be their friend, but people are more productive when they like their jobs and who they work for. Also, going to speak with her alone and threatening her job, she might go to HR for that. That\u2019s why BIL said what he said. That was completely unprofessional, especially since you aren\u2019t in the work place and at at family event.", "So instead of maybe taking a pause here for a little self reflection and possible improvement you decided to prove to everyone that she's right and you're a jackass your employees are afraid of.\n\nWas it the right venue for Emma to put all of this out there?

No.\n\nBut the fact she was so ready and able to share them\u2014and the way you reacted\u2014makes me think that YTA, both in this tale and at work.", "ESH  - you are the biggest AH here though. In most places, this does not count as a resignation legally and would be considered firing. The fact that you don't understand the difference between firing someone and a resignation is a huge red flag for a manager, and it brings into question the legitimacy of your other \"strict\" ways. If you have such an issue with this person's behavior, act like a real manager and have a formal meeting during work hours. If you feel this person is not a good fit to work for you, then you can fire them, but unless they give you a formal resignation in writing they are not quiting.\nEither way, you can't control how people speak about you and quite frankly if you're so confident in your methods you shouldn't care so much. I will say the rest of the family (including employee) who continued to talk about work when you asked them to not are also AH, but at least they're not going to potentially ruin anyone's livelihood.", "Absolutely YTA you told someone you were firing someone when you really weren't, just to make a point.

She talked badly about him in front of the whole family, she deserved for him to call her out on it. He didn\u2019t actually fire her, she still works there. But maybe now she won\u2019t shit talk people to their faces?? Especially her boss. \n\nAnd for BIL to say that because OP is a hardass as a boss he\u2019s worried OP will abuse his wife?? That\u2019s a leap. Lots of people are much more strict and regimented at work because *it\u2019s work*. If there had never been any reason to be worried before, it\u2019s so weird that he thinks he should be worried now based on his job performance.", "ESH.

It's not clear from the post whether OP yells or fights with employees, but it sounds like the work environment may be intimidating or unpleasant for some people.\n\nOn the other hand, it doesn't seem like Emma, the employee, handled the situation very well either. She made negative comments about OP in front of their family, which is unprofessional and disrespectful. Additionally, it doesn't sound like she was entirely honest with OP when they asked her about her feelings towards working for them.\n\nFinally, the in-laws and wife also contributed to the tension by bringing up work-related issues at a family gathering and continuing to ask questions despite OP's request to change the subject.\n\nIn short, everyone involved could have handled the situation more effectively and with more consideration for others. It's understandable that everyone has different perspectives and may not see eye to eye, but it's important to communicate and resolve conflicts in a respectful and productive way.", "YTA\n\nShe didn't resign - you fired her! Everything she said was true and you proved it - it's a wonder you have any employees \nI would be worried about your wife too - you're right everyone else is wrong\nWhat did your wife have to say about all this or does she not have a voice?", "NTA - but a disciplinary when she was back at work would have been more professional than a resignation at the house", "ESH but you're the bigger TA.", "NTA. You said you guys should stop talking about it and she continued. She called you a jackass. Whether that is true or not, you can\u2019t just insult your boss and call them names and expect to still have a job", "Wow YTA big time and you sound like a nightmare of a boss too. You sound like you go out of your way to penalize your employees for being human. This poor lady tries to be lighthearted about being stuck at a holiday gathering with her horrible boss and because she\u2019s at all honest you go right to bullying and threatening her. You didn\u2019t tell her or anyone else that you really prefer not to discuss your workplace at family gatherings so neither Emma or anyone else knew that it was a problem for you. Jake is absolutely right to worry about the environment his sister is living in because you are intentionally cruel and heartless. Instead of attacking Emma you should have listened and you need to take to heart the fact that you literally terrorize your employees on a regular basis. Start being a better boss and a better person because you obviously have some serious problems.", "I would go ESH. \n\nYou are over reacting, that is clear. However, the continuation of a conversation which you are uncomfortable with is clearly inappropriate. Do your in laws know what boundaries are?", "I think you need to have a think about how you behave at work, you sound like a nightmare and maybe hearing this from Emma hit a nerve. Definitely not the right place for her to say these things, but everyone at work seems to have the same, negative opinion of you which makes me think you\u2019re the AH. Pretending to fire her was an absolute AH move too. Lighten up, dude! Learn to laugh at yourself a bit m!", "YTA. You can have super high standards without being a jerk.", "I don\u2019t understand all these comments, definitely NTA. If I went to my boss\u2019 house for Christmas and bad-talked him to his family *to his face* I\u2019d expect repercussions too. Being outside the office doesn\u2019t exempt you from things - I don\u2019t go home and reveal client confidential information because I\u2019m out of work. That\u2019s not how it goes. If she really has the balls to badmouth him like that then she\u2019s clearly not an employee you\u2019d want and why isn\u2019t she quitting if it\u2019s that bad?", "Yta and you're fired if HR hear about it\nWait sorry, you RESIGN", "ESH but YTA. Think about the work environment you are creating. Sounds terrible. Employee complaints should result in change/self reflection, not their termination. Read literally any leadership article. Also, crappy job keeping work and personal life separated.", "ESH. I think what she said was out of line, but if basically everyone at works thinks you're a nightmare to work with, isn't it better to yk, sit down and think about it?\nYou literaly just proved her point. You are a jackass.", "YTA you keep acting like you did something rational here when it's obvious you didn't like being called out on being an asshole at work and were throwing your equivalent of a tantrum.\n\nYou could reflect on why people hate you so much and feel some shame for your behaviour. Instead you acted like a narcissistic loser, how dare she say this about me!!! I'm not a bully! I'm a tough boss and it makes me successful! Stomp stomp stomp.\n\nNo matter how polite they are to your face, this is what everyone who saw your behaviour and all of us hearing about it afterwards can see.\n\nIf you are going to continue to be a toxic asshole at work, people will know. Huffing about it won't save you.", " I think ESH.", "YTA\nYour rigid and impossible perfectionism must be a nightmare to deal with professionally and personally.  You aren't right just because you think you are. You don't get to police what people talk about and you most certainly don't get to dictate what an employee says outside if work. Get the stick out of your butt and atop acting like you embody righteousness.  She told you how your employees feel about you.  A wise person would reflect on it and change their behavior. You need help sir.", "Yes absolutely YTA.\n\nShe hasn't resigned. You know she hasn't resigned. \nIt sounds like you want to terminate her employment and don't want to take responsibility for it.\n\nYou made this a power play, when you're in a position of authority. It sounds like you also bailed her up outside of work to have a go at her.  I can't adequately explain just how inappropriate that is.\n\nYou absolutely deserve to be called out on it and judging by your behaviour, I would be very surprised if her assessment of you as a boss is wrong.", "YTA. You fired her and over general criticism. In front of others who cna corroborate her story. Depending on where you live, she could sue for wrongful termination. You apparently can't handle hearing what employee think about you and your employees are obviously fearful of saying those things where you cna hear them. Take what she said and work on it. Also consider hiring an outside survey group to conduct an anonymous employee survey so you can find what works and what doesn't and fix those things", "YTA, you absolutely proved her right. You owe your success to terrorizing your employees, bravo.", "YTA. I hope you are not being serious. That was OUTSIDE of work. She didn't say she wants leave her job so you are technically wrong. She just said she found working there hard. You know how many people may struggle in a work setting??\n\nInstead of maybe listening to what she said, you are basically creating a work place where people will feel even more scared of voicing their opinion. You are basically becoming too authoritative and being a dictator rather than a leader.", "YTA Your work environment sounds hostile. Sad that you think it's OK that your employees are afraid of you.", "YTA and obviously you mock fired her so she would feel dominated and at your mercy.\n\nI would be concerned about your wife, too, tbh.", "Wait until the parents get an ear full from BIL! Everyone is going to wonder what the hell is going on at home too. No wonder you choose to travel during the holidays and avoid the family. \n\nYTA", "OP, while you may have been understandably angry and upset, you were also extremely quick to retaliate in a way that makes her comments look utterly justified. It wasn\u2019t a well-measured, rational response, and I don't see any signs that you reflect critically on your work behavior in the aftermath. Managers need to be able to accept feedback and improve from it just as much as employees... if not moreso.\n\nYou revealed your character to your in-laws in a big way by threatening your employee at a family function, and they're right to be concerned.\n\nESH.", "Both of you are the AH. If her concerns are alarming she should go to HR not discuss them at a family gathering. You made it worse by trying to prove your point. This is a huge HR nightmare. She may claim you are creating a toxic work environment. She is unprofessional and you sound domineering.\n\nI get it, standards should be high. Employees should do their jobs. But mistakes happen. Should they be corrected, of course. It all comes to how you approach it.", "YTA. Emma was asked a question, and she answered it honestly. Her candor infuriated you all you used your authority over her to make her recant. You seem to be a tyrant.\n\nApparently, you like to flatter yourself and see your oppressive style as having high standards. If your own view were true, you would be able to take honest feedback. You didn\u2019t have the moral fortitude to tell Emma in front of the group that you took her words as a her resignation. There was no reason to have a private discussion for that exchange other than not wanting to prove Emma\u2019s point right then and there.\n\nA good supervisor would have taken Emma\u2019s words as the gift they were. The two of you could have had a conversation where you clarified some of the decisions you made. You could have used this as an opportunity to create a better relationship with your employees.

Usually I'd lean towards she's TA, talk shit get hit etc. But... Jack should probably apologize for her behaviour as well instead of sitting on a moral high horse. She's just a girlfriend and you're a BIL and also she's just so incredibly stupid lmao so we all know it won't last\n\nYou need to chill, the fact you chose to go for a work based power play (after saying you want to keep work out of your private life) instead of just communicating and/or shouting it out like a normal person shows a terribly strict and upright person - I'd also hate to work for you\n\nPaying well doesn't mean you have to be a prick - news flash high performing people who fulfil your standards also can get hired elsewhere", "YTA - post your thread in Antiwork too, if you want a more detailed reason for my comment ;)", "ESH, Emma should've stopped when you asked the first time. But you're a bully and it shows through what she said about you and what you said to her. Sure she crossed a boundary, should have respected it, but your discipline measures showed more about your true colours. No wonder your BIL was worried about your sister, you were a major bully. A good boss would've handled this by setting a firm boundary without threatening to fire or force resignation.\n\nSkeevy thing to do. Your employees are scared of you for a reason, and I don't think it's work ethics but displays of power.", "NTA. I don't understand all the y.t.a. judgements here. The woman was talking shit about her boss to his family IN FRONT OF HIM and then got upset he OBVIOUSLY didn't like that??\n\nNTA. At all. You didn't ask if you're the asshole about being strict at work, that I can't and won't judge based on this woman's comments. Eve if you are, the fact that she thought she could just badmouth you to your family with no repercussions is actually quite funny to me lol", "ESH she went to far and shouldn\u2019t have called you a jackass but it also sounds like you are a jackass so\u2026", "YTA. She was, too, but use this new knowledge to make yourself a better boss.", "This point needs to be seen and acknowledged by OP, because it's very important!!! Speaks volumes.", "The woman decided to badmouth her boss to his family in front of him, and he's expected to just sit there and be quiet? F off, he is NTA.", "Depends on where they live. In my area, you don't need a reason to terminate employment", "Downvote, but happy cake day!", "Couldn\u2019t this get messy legally?", "It mostly sounds like Emma is an idiot. Why else would you call your boss a jackass to his face in front of his family? It doesn't matter if its true, it's just very stupid.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA here as well. But I\u2019m also in a stuffy industry and used to getting torn up by management.", "Alcohol was probably involved.", "You need a clear N T A for your vote to count.", "I really hope she tells this to every other employee so they will only ever talk about work and the weather with OP because you never know what might set him off.", "He definitely proofed her point.", "I did say there were like 10 people that were regulars in my office and that she wasn't one and I had no idea where these stories were coming from. She didn't stop and said everyone knew them.", "I wasn't going to go through with it obviously\nI just wanted to make a point", "It was a holiday family get together. She is in a casual setting. You think she is thinking about professionalism? Did she go too far? Probably. But it is understandable. Who doesn't trash talk their boss who is difficult around friends and family?", "It is very odd.  I have to assume most posters here are students home from the holidays who have only worked crappy jobs, if they\u2019ve ever worked at all.", "Yes, I do. OP is absolutely the asshole. Just because he is too delicate to accept it, doesn't make it untrue. He should take this as an opportunity to see how he is truly perceived in the office.

Unfortunately,  there are quite a few places where there is practically no difference between the 2...", "So he can be a dick and when an employee says something about it he can just say that that employee should stop saying that and otherwise that employee is considered to have resigned? How is that not an asshole move? YTA.", "But she didn't go to her boss' house. There is a difference. She went as the BIL date. Yes she shouldn't have said some things, but I feel like due to the causal setting it is something that can easily slip up.\n\nLet's say she didn't say anything in the table. She still might have said something to the BIL and the information might still have reached the whole family. I feel like that would have been inevitable either way.\n\nAlso just because your don't like your work environment doesn't mean you can afford to quit or want to. You could love your role still", "If his ego is bruised by her telling the truth, he can fire her, but she did not resign.", "She also can\u2019t be really that scared of him, if would say such things to his face.", "The power differential is indeed the thing people are skipping past. Bosses have more power than employees and therefore more responsibility.", "I wonder if the MIL was so insistent on hearing more stories because she wanted to know if he displays problematic behavior in different settings.", "I'm not difficult to work with, however I'm going to get exceptionally pissy when called out and fire someone.\n\nWith that said how dense does Emma have to be. She's either extremely short sighted or got carried and thought she could get that pent up frustration out because she'd be \"safe\" due to the situation.", "Thank you! Also, did OP internalize or consider the examples she mentioned, or did he immediately jump to threatening to fire her? Is he capable of self-reflection?", "Let's be honest here . People that have a brain dont call the person that is in a position to fire them at will a jackass ... Its not like she is getting penalized for normal chit chat...", "You sound like a tyrant, based on what you have told us. No doubt the stories others would tell are even worse. \n\nOf course your employees complain about your awful behavior to each other.", "Was the point to show that you are indeed a jackass?", "In which case you're abusing your position of power. Massive arsehole move.", "You made a point: that you're an asshole.", "So you're now 10x TA for thinking that threatening a woman's livelihood when you didn't even intend to FIRE HER (again, wtf, YOU WERE THREATENING TO FIRE HER, SHE WASN'T RESIGNING) is in any respect OK.  You have a serious problem with professional communication that rivals hers, but since you hold all the cards in your relationship your actions are a million times worse than hers.\n\nIf you don't like the way she's speaking, give her a first warning (usually a verbal warning) or FIRE her if it's egregious enough, don't switch the script into her RESIGNING.", "Does Emma still have her job?", "I was going to vote you clear of asshole behaviour, because she felt very comfortable shitting on you in a non-professional setting, but this... makes you the YTA. I'm sorry, but that's a really messed-up power play, my man.", "And your point being that you are an asshole?", "Yeah where I come from she can sue your sorry ass for this alone. YTA and I pity your wife.", "Wow - you \"fire\" her to make a point? Seek help dude. This isn't normal.  It's not mature. And it sure as hell isn't professional.", "You mean you were making a point to demonstrate dominance. You're an AH and probably in many ways, not just this.", "It's not HER friends and family, it's HIS friends and family. She badmouthed her BOSS in front of him to HIS family and expected nothing to happen???? Who tf does that???", "I actually work in a professional setting lol still think he is the AH.", "How do we know it is the \"truth\"? It is Emma's opinion, based on hearsay. She has had little direct contact with OP at work so she really doesn't have first hand knowledge of what he is like", "Except, we have no idea if she's telling the truth, right? We have her opinion and his. That's it. She is just as unreliable a witness as he is, here. People can have different standards of expectations of appropriate behavior (we certainly have that here in this thread). So, why is her opinion more reliable than his? It can just be a difference of opinion.\n\nOther commenters are saying that everyone else in the workplace hates working for him, another claim we have absolutely no facts about.\n\nThe facts we do know: she badmouthed, insulted, and embarrassed him in front of his family at a family function that had nothing to do with work.\n\nAs is too common with this sub, if the genders were reversed, she would be deemed NOT ta for having to deal with her disrespectful coworker at her family function.", "Yup, Emma was super dense and being kind of a dick badmouthing him to his family, which is why it's ESH for me. But OP really should've taken a deep breath and discussed it with her after the holidays, ideally with an HR mediator present. Her unprofessionalism doesn't justify OP's.", "I think you may want to reconsider your first sentence above - in fact at least one person thinks you are difficult to work for (not with).  You were given a gift - an unvarnished opinion of what it's like to work for you.  This is not a fact: it's one person's candid feelings about what you are like at work (with some anecdotal information from their peers thrown in for good measure).  So take that for what it's worth, and maybe look at your own behaviors.  If you are happy with the way you manage, there is no need to change anything, but if you want to be more approachable and your employees more relaxed, you may want to take that information and adjust your responses to situations at work.", "And it does not hurt to be careful and since OP is obviously a friend of petty power plays, better stick to the weather.", "No the point was to see if she was truly as dissatisfied as she was. If that was the case, she'd gladly resign anyway. \nAlso, her stories and all made absolutely no sense. I didn't even know the people she was talking about.  Emma and I probably have seen each other only twice at work.", "Yes", "Telling someone they resigned because you do not like what they say is jackass behaviour and employees also have good reason to fear OP, these are things we learned from his story.", "Sure , but I doubt the rest were foolish enough to actually personally insult their boss .", "No everyone who is dissatisfied with work can afford to quit.", "Just because someone is dissatisfied with work doesn't mean they want to leave their role. They don't have to be mutually exclusive. I could love my role at my job, but not enjoy my work environment.\n\nShouldn't an employee be able to voice their dissatisfaction with the working environment? Yes she did take it too far, but there is nothing wrong with giving feed back about a working environment not being that great.\n\nShe could be the only one, but it is still something to take into consideration and maybe ask if others think the same.\n\nHaving a good working environment where employees are satisfied also helps with work productivity", "You do realize that you pay her to do her job and not to worship the ground you walk on? Not liking the jackass of a boss that she has, does not mean she is doing bad work or that she does not need the job.", "One can only \u201cgladly resign\u201d only if there\u2019s another job lined up, and in this economy many folks will struggle hard if let go because it\u2019s hard to find a job in some industries. So assuming Emma isn\u2019t a trust fund baby, what seems to have happen here is Emma weighted the prospects of not having money to pay her bills on one hand and working for you on the on the other. So I guess working for you is better than experiencing financial a ruin so how bad can it really be right? We don\u2019t even have debtors prisons in US. My heart goes out to Emma!", "Maybe she needs this job. Many people have endured untenable conditions because they need the money or the job gives them experience in their field. I don\u2019t believe you are so naive to have missed stories about employees who were pressured to sleep with their bosses or do other unsavory things because they felt they couldn\u2019t say no. You are that boss.", "So your response to her was an effort to frighten her because she thinks you\u2019re difficult to work for. YTA. Threatening to fire someone in this way is horrible. It sounds like you are a challenging person to work for and your employees have a right to be fearful around you.", "Then they should try and maintain a decent relationship at family functions, I'm saying.", "I agree and we have several people at the office that are literally there to address these things. Family functions aren't the ideal place for these discussions to take place.", "now I sound like I'm defending OP, but there is a time and place for everything. what you wrote all stands, but a family holiday dinner is NOT an appropriate time and place to address your work grievances to your boss... take it up with your boss during work hours.", "Absolutely. It also does not mean she gets to talk the way she does in a family setting after I precisely said I would prefer to leave work at work", "It's straight up bullying. He's a bully.", "Or they should allow themselves to be honest, something I value in my family.", "Maybe she felt like she wasn't being listened to? Maybe she was being lighthearted? Maybe she was trying to impress her boyfriend's family, since they kept asking? Maybe she just didn't see what's the big deal? \n\nIf you felt that uncomfortable with that was being said, you could have told her just that. That you prefer to not talk about work with your family and if she has any feedback to go through the necessary steps at work.\n\nYou didn't need to make the comment about resignation, that's abusing your power.\n\nRegardless how you feel it is still outside work; Unless on the contract/employee handbook it says you can't talk make comments like that outside of work, in social settings.\n\nI still feel like it is no big deal, it was a casual family setting. She probably didn't think much of it. Who says she doesn't already tell her boyfriend? Probably next thing the information is still going to reach your whole family. I feel like that's just one of the consequences of working with someone in your family.", "They asked the question though? It's like me going to a family dinner and they asked me how is your job? Do you like it? I can easily reply with, I don't like it cause my boss is this and that. It's a common family question.\n\nThe difference is that the boss was there. So yes she probably should have been more cautious, but I feel like it is a easy slip up. The environment is completely different to a social environment that's still work focused", "Then maybe you should fire your wife and MIL because they brought it up. And she was just telling the truth, obviously.", "Just because you prefer to leave work at work doesn't mean she does.  You don't get to control what she talks about outside of work.  She had every right to discuss whatever she wanted to talk about in a personal setting and it's NOT your business.", "yeah, although I'm going with ESH overall, everyone should have enough common sense NOT to bash their boss to their face and think that because it's a family event it's ok and they are safe from repercussions... if you think your boss is a d*ck, it's more than probably not a good idea to tell him that in front of his in laws \ud83d\ude02", "Yes and they could be exactly that, honest, at work. If there are problems, there are people there to address them. I don't personally deal with everything. But obviously there are options to address these concerns at work and use the said honesty there.", "True, that personal opinion would have been better something Emma kept to herself. However, OP has not proven that he IS an AH. When, not if but when, BIL talks to the family about what OP said about firing Emma this will justifiably reinforce the AH opinion about him.", "It doesn't sound like she considers working under you to be a safe environment to express herself honestly. Your reaction confirms that it would have been a bad idea. You delivered a veiled threat to fire her at a family function, who knows what you would do in the office.", "Oh but she's comfortable saying that to my face? Don't you see the problem here? If she can be like this at a family function where I am there myself, why can't she say the very same thing to a representative that is literally there to listen to her complaints about her supervisors including me", "so she is so afraid of OP that she never interacts with him at work, but feels safe to go to his family's event and openly bad mouth him? \n\nI agree he handled it the wrong way. he couldve just privately tell her that he really doesnt appreciate to have his work displayed in his family's events, and would like to keep it at work if she has any problems to solve them there.\n\nshe also didnt seem very *scared* to keep going on and on and on while ignoring him asking to shut it. because he's a tough boss doesnt mean he's not entitled to boundaries. Emma sucks just as much."]}
