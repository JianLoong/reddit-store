The experience you described sounds traumatic and upsetting, valid reasons for resentment.", "NTA. Your experience sounds horrific, and it is absolutely understandable that you don\u2019t want to relive the trauma, let alone expose yourself to something like that again. The fact that your niece is not really responsible for how she is (no doubt learned these behaviours from and was taught them by her mother) doesn\u2019t change the seriousness of what you experienced.\n\nIt is unfortunate because she is a child, but sometimes circumstances just end up like this, and it\u2019s not your fault, either.", "NTA. But that child was raised feeling that she had the right to abuse you, for YEARS. That's not just going to go away. It's your sister's fault for letting this go on and destroying any possible relationship you might have had with her. Don't feel guilty at not helping either of them.", "NTA.\n\nStay no contact with abusers. \nDon\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep others warm.", "NTA. You wouldn't be TA even if you had a great relationship with your family. This is a 13-year-old human, and you are being asked to take care of her and raise her - a lifelong commitment to another human - and being a blood relative doesn't magically make you capable of being a parent to a grieving teenager who just lost her (apparently quite abusive) mother.\n\nAlso... kids in a certain age range try on and discard personalities like clothing. Kids who come from households with abusive and/or neglectful parents may act manipulative and deceptive because they're desperate to protect themselves. If her behavior during your recovery time is the only thing holding you back, you may want to talk to a therapist or social worker about the situation to give you peace of mind on your decision one way or the other. I'm sorry you're dealing with this horrible situation, OP.", "NTA. Not your kid. Not your responsibility. Let them find a friend or someone closer to your sisters age. You\u2019re 26, single and have your own life to live and family (If you want one) to grow. Besides, I\u2019m guessing girls mom and aunt will find someone else. Don\u2019t feel bullied or pressured into doing anything you aren\u2019t ready for. Raising a kid from baby up is hard enough but getting a troubled teen who\u2019s mom just died? Yea, that\u2019s a big no. You\u2019d have to have medical/dental, housing/food/clothing and education set up. Not to mention the therapy she needs! Then her attitude will suck even if she wouldn\u2019t be in mourning! I would let it go. That\u2019s way too much for a young man trying to just be responsible for themselves!", "The kid gossiped about you because she was grateful to not be the target of her alcoholic mother's abuse for the moment.\n\nPlease forgive her.\n\nRegarding the guardianship: NTA. \n\nHowever, here's a plan: Tell sister that if there's a trust for your niece that will cover her through college, you'll take over if she dies. If not, then the 44-yo who is more established must be the one.\n\nDo not assume responsibility for medical bills. You will be poor the rest of your life.", "My father abused me for ten years and then my family got mad at me when he died and I basically said, 'okay'.   You owe this woman and child absolutely nothing, especially after treating you as a doormat for so long.  You are not responsible for this child in anyway, I would think twice about having ANY contact with her, foster care or not.  I know a few people in your situation and the foster family started asking for money to help buy things that they didn't want to pay for.  You are NTAH.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you had yo go through all of that, but at least you're better now. Overall it's pretty simple. Not your kid, not your responsibility. You have a choice to make to adopt her, but you absolutely don't have to.", "NTA, you probably are not well enough mentally to handle raising this kid.

You are seriously going to hold the behavior of a preteen acting like her abusive mother against her?  Do you have any idea how horrible foster care can be?

She's got a 13 yr old girl.\n\nDue to the fact that there's a high risk of her passing, she and my other sister (44f) would like me to be the back up guardian/parent for my niece. And also, they're asking me to help out with her hospital and home bills.\n\nIn a normal situation, I would not hesitate to help and would absolutely take her daughter under my wing. But our relationship has been anything but normal. For a few years, I succumbed to an illness which forced me to live with my sister and her kid and my recovery was hindered by the horrific abuse I endured at both of their hands. She'd often drink and degrade me not only with words, and I'd often overhear her daughter gossiping with her about me. Her kid would also disrespect me directly and she'd enable her behaviour.\n\nNow I'm in a good space, my health has returned, I've a great job and my own place. I've not been in touch for a few months until my eldest sister reached out to inform me of the situation.\n\nMy eldest sister cannot adopt the kid as she has several small children and a condition, there are also other reasons that I can not go into but her reasons are legitimate and I understand. I'm the only suitable blood relative in a position to take responsibility.\n\nShe'd mock and gossip about my illness with her mother, how bad I smelt through no fault of my own (my skin condition was such) and absolutely disrespect me to my face.\n\nI never actually took out anything on either of them. In fact, when her mother would berate her, I would defend my niece in my broken state in spite of how my niece also treated me. She would act nice and kind to me when her mother was on her case and she needed my help, or if she wanted me to do something for her but change completely as soon as she got it. A very 2 faced kid and manipulative.\n\nBut due to the horrendous treatment I endured, I am not willing to help them in any way and I'm being viewed as heartless. They walked all over me when I was at my lowest and bed ridden. I cannot express how bad my mental health was, often thought of s3lf-deletion as they treated me like a doormat and had no other options\n\nI wanted to hear some opinions on this...\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just... no.\n\nThis girl is not OP's responsibility in any shape or form.

There's a very good chance she'll just run away and end up pregnant or trafficked anyway.\n\nThe foster system statistics aren't great, but there are good experiences there too.

It sucks to have tried to be the better person for so long, and it must be exhausting to even think about doing more. I can't imagine what you're going through thinking about all the ramifications; none of this is easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, what you've described is a kid. A brat, sure, but a kid. Kids are manipulative; I was, so was my sister, so was every kid I knew. We had to be taught to put others first, and that required a LOT of patience from my parents. In the end, I think it worked out pretty well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you were in her shoes, with her mother, how would you turn out? Better? Worse? nobody can know for sure, but I guess I'm just not willing to write someone off at that age, even if they've been horrible.", "Hurt people hurt people.

I'm not blaming the faults of the foster system on OP. I'm saying that OP WBTA for allowing her niece to go into foster care. \n\nIdeally, there would be a family friend that her sister could designate as guardian.
