It's understandable that you would want to keep something sentimental, especially given your sister's past behavior of taking your childhood items and not taking care of them.

I listened to a reddit story where the OPs parents tried to steal his house to give to his brother.

Life lessons. There is also value in everyone who lives in a home feeling that their possessions are being respected. This is a very strange decision your parents are making.

My parents split up when I was a toddler and my brother and I were raised by my dad. When I was around eleven my dad had a girlfriend who had two daughters: one my age and a six year old. I had this jacket my mom had given me when I was younger and though it didn\u2019t fit me, I kept it because it made me think of my mom. The little girl was a spoiled brat and wanted my jacket so badly she wouldn\u2019t stop crying. My dad told me to give it to her because I was too big for it and I said no because my mom gave it to me. I ended up getting punished for being \u201cselfish\u201d and the little girl got the jacket I was holding onto for sentimental value", "NTA Unless lil sis has hyper focus on bears due to trauma", "NTA.

Your whole family has no respect for you or your accomplishments", "NTA. Hold your ground. You are allowed to have things that are sentimental to you and off limits to others.  I'm sure your little sister has plenty of other teddy bears you can play with. Many times a kid will find out someone else wants something and they will want it even more. Your mom is the AH for pandering to this, my guess is It probably would not have been sitting on a shelf with the other things you won if it were okay for the little one to play with.", "NTA put her in your moms wedding dress for a day let her wear sentimental jewlery from your parents.
