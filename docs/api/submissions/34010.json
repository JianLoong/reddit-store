I told my siblings and siblings in law I'll watch your children and return your them alive with all their original parts. If you want more than that, hire a sitter. I had routines with my children. I was concerned about their nutrition but even they were entitled to a night off and a little fun.", "I was always the fun adult but as I was18 when my brothers were 3 and 5 I did babysit then and quite a few of their friends. On the weekends only a couple rules no shrieking in bed at a certain time but you can stay up and talk. Mostly cause shrieking gave me a head ache and bed made the parents happy. But yeah w usually pizza or order in did not insist on veggies and could play games or tv till whatever time bed was usually 9 and 10 when little older. I never said they had to sleep just get in bed lots less resistance. School nights had a couple other rules but that was mostly my brothers.", "NAH. I don't think her rules are unreasonable per se, but I think it's unreasonable to expect you to follow them to a T when you have other kids in your care as well.", "NTA. What she\u2019s offering aren\u2019t normal rules. Normal rules set a bedtime and limit tv or video games, nor limiting playtime and setting an entire schedule to the hour and minute. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to keep to keep up with that when you have all the other boys also.", "NTA. As a parent of 2 young children this is not how you respond to a fun aunt who offers to watch your kids for free and provide a night of fun. If he\u2019s too young for looser rules, he should stay home with mom.", "NTA, the kid's just too young to be in this situation. Your sister wants you to babysit him and give him special rules while 4 other children have all the fun? What's the fun in this for absolutely anyone? He should just be with his mom, or she can drop him off and pick him up for his bath and bedtime.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re inviting him to an event with your rules. \nIf Sis doesn\u2019t like them, she gets to decline.  She can ask for some minor adjustments but ASK not demand.  Anything outside what you\u2019re willing too bad.  Again, she can decline", "NAH.\n\nShe's the mom, she gets to decide how she wants to raise her child, and none of her rules sound unreasonable for a 4 year old. It actually sounds like good, structured parenting.\n\nYou're also not obligated to take care of him or invite him if you don't want to adhere to those rules. It's your party.\n\nIt does suck for the kid that you're both being stubborn and he's the one that gets punished for the fact that nobody can bend and everyone wants to argue instead of finding a middle ground (like maybe he comes over for a couple hours and his mom's rules are followed, but doesn't stay the night and after 6pm the older kids get more freedom), but everyone is allowed to have their boundaries. And 4 is a little young for a sleepover like this anyway, so I don't think it will cause him any long term damage to stick to his routine at home. Hopefully he gets plenty of other opportunities to bond with you and his cousins in ways that are more age appropriate for him.", "NTA.  If they did all that stuff every day, or even every week, it would be bad for them.  But letting loose every down and then at Auntie\u2019s house?  Go for it!   I has STRICT rules about some of these things for my kids.  But at a special party? Forget it.  Let them have fun.  Back home they will be back on their usual schedule and all the better for the change.  Sure, it might make for a day or two of \u201creentry\u201d but that is ok.  Teaches them flexibility.", "NTA; if she\u2019s not comfortable with the level freedom, she doesn\u2019t have to let him go. Which is fine; you\u2019d only be the AH if you push back if that\u2019s her decision.", "NTA\n\nHave her pick him up at 6. He's apparently not old enough to spend a night having fun with his cousins (that's her call to make), and she can decide when he is, probably 16 or 17 from the sound of her.\n\nAnd it's ridiculous to suggest you should ignore the older kids so you can wrestle an unwilling 4yr old into the bath and then stare at him like he's microwave popcorn about to burn to make sure no one lets him have something good to eat and then force him to go to bed before anyone else is anywhere close to it. \n\nBottom line, it'll be a night of miserable 4yr old tantrums instead of the fun filled cousin's night you want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he\u2019s not yet ready for the kind of party you have in mind, sister can decline on his behalf. \n\nDon\u2019t try to insist that he attend with your rules. Just state what you will be doing and leave it up to your sister to decide what works for her child. But also don\u2019t let her guilt you into being the mom to her child.\n\nYou may find that limiting sugar intake and keeping to a schedule is a LOT more important for a 4yo than for your older nephews, as not doing those things may lead to his being cranky and having a meltdown. You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology. Just tell your sister that you have invited her son to a specific type of party but understand if he\u2019s not old enough for it yet and will invite him in future years. End of discussion.", "NTA. Four children at once is heaps. It\u2019s meant to be a fun weekend. I can understand not wanting to abide by such rules under these conditions", "On the verge of YTA. You really shouldn\u2019t have invited him if you were not prepared to care for a 4 year old. Regardless of her rules, it is going to be more work for you. This really does not sounds like a good fit for either of you. Best case scenario, she drops him off for a few hours and picks him up before 6 so you don\u2018t have to worry about the nighttime sugar or bath.  In regards to the no sugar after 6, that really would have been in your best interest if you think you were going to get him to bed easily unless you were just planning to let him stay up super late with all the other nephews.  If that was the case, YWBTA.", "NTA\nYou offered a fun family night. Sounds like she\u2019s not comfortable with letting go of the schedule she set for her 4 yr old.  Maybe when he\u2019s 5 she\u2019ll let him have this type of \u201cfancy free\u201d fun night \u2026.? Try again next year ?", "NTA. It sounds like he's too young for this anyway. I hope he gets to participate when he's older as this will be a special time for him.\n\nI want to say how much this will mean to your nephews as they grow up. My brother and SIL are 14 years older, and the week I spent with my SIL was so memorable. She made up so many fun things to do and was so into it all. She's gone now, but she'll always be one of my favorite people for the effort. Too few kids get that so it's awesome for you to be there,", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.

A little extra sugar isn\u2019t going to hurt him. You sound like a wonderful aunt.", "NTA. She can drop him off from 4-6 and then take him away from the fun and ruin his night all by herself.", "NTA. Your sister is being unreasonable.", "NTA. I would simply say to your sister that thinking about it that nephew may still be too young for a full overnight. If she would like him to come between this time and six o'clock then have him picked up it would be great. As he gets older you can revisit him spending the night with his cousins and you. \n\nHe is younger and your sister feels he needs a schedule that doesn't vibe with the night. Between bathtime and getting him to bed it takes your eyes off the older nephews which isn't the greatest plan. If  your sister refuses the compromise, then just say you will offer again when nephew gets older.", "NTA, but I would try to find a compromise so he can be included with his cousins. For example, have his mom pick him up before 8pm so she can handle his usual bedtime and routine at home after a fun afternoon/evening with everyone.", "NTA, I\u2019m a mother of 4, one of whom is currently a 4 year old boy. If she wants to put those rules in place, she can pick him up early or not bring him at all. He will not go to bed and bath easily if all the big kids are playing games and eating junk food. Mom wants to exclude him from the fun, not OP.", "YTA\n\nYou invited a 4 year old to a sleepover party? Dude. They have bedtime routines and get scared of the dark and need adult supervision. She thought you were offering to take care of her kid for the night. What you were actually offering was to, I guess, let him swim, possibly supervising him?, and eat candy until midnight. He's 4. \n\nLet's be clear. You don't love your nephew. You like him and think he's cute. If you loved him, you would know enough about him to know that he isn't able to enjoy this party and it is not safe and responsible to offer to have him over if you are not prepared to do actual child care. He's a child, you see, and he needs actual care.", "NTA.  You are running the show.", "I was the fun aunt before I was the strict mama. I\u2019m still the fun aunt, and when I have my niblings even our own house rules get thrown out the window for cousin fun time. I\u2019m not letting them pound coffee at midnight or break stuff, but bed time is when one of us can no longer sit upright, and food rules are \u201ceat something real and then whatever you want\u201d. We\u2019re not babysitting, we\u2019re making memories.", "This.", "I didn't truly appreciate my single aunts until just now.", "Nta... nowhere did she say that she cannot or will not care for him. All she said was that he will be cared for as she deems fit and will not be able to follow strict rules regarding his schedule.  He will be fed and will be safe - that is good enough caring for a sleepover.", "SIL is gone now? What happened?", "I agree. Little kids have not started the stinky hormones yet. They only need a bath every day if they wet their pants, get food/glue/mud in their hair, or throw up on themselves. I know many parents like the calming nighttime bath routine, but chances are the kid doesn\u2019t actually need a daily bath. \n\nAnd the first rule of sleepovers, even if the parents are there to manage everything, is that things are not going to run to the same schedule as at home. The kid\u2019s going to be too riled up. You always plan on a cranky day or two after a fun visit.", "This was my thought too.  Hes going to want to do what the bigger kids are doing, and surely he can skip a bath one night for a fun time with his family? Especially if it\u2019s only once a year? C\u2019mon mom.  She\u2019s being a buzzkill!", ">Parents get to set rules for their kids and these are all absolutely reasonable rule\n\nExpecting to bathe him is reasonable as well..?", "NTA\n\nBut also this isn't a half-bad solution, really. He'd get some fun with his aunt and cousins, his mom would get a couple child-free hours, and then he'd go home, have his bath, and get to bed on time.", "This was the solution. Except I'm not sure I would trust OP with a 4 year old and a pool.", "This is the way", "Exactly. Same here.", "No small child is going to go to sleep at 8 pm  when their cousins are watching a movie, eating pizza rolls, pop corn and candy. They'll keep getting up and trying to join the fun. Yes, your child may be a little logy or cranky the next day but let's be real, some times kids are going to be kids. I get the feeling that tiger mama still counts her child's age in months.", "What do you want for dinner? Ice cream, okay, it has dairy in it.", "Curiosity, but what did OP say that makes you think she\u2019s negligent?", "\"I stressed that I wasn't babysitting my nephews...\" yes, she goes on from there but that's  insane. He's 4. She's going to ensure his care by... not following a schedule, feeding him candy, and then becoming very confused when he cries because the big kids are excluding him. Or goes to her for supervision because that's what 4 year olds do. They follow adults around looking for child care. It's almost like it is some kind of genetically encoded instinct that is present in all of them because those who didn't have it wandered off and were eaten by bears or something. He's 4. She's an asshole.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. There\u2019s a difference between not following the parent\u2019s rules at OP\u2019s house and not supervising the child at all letting them drown in a bloody pool or generally being unsafe."]}
