But yeah w usually pizza or order in did not insist on veggies and could play games or tv till whatever time bed was usually 9 and 10 when little older. I never said they had to sleep just get in bed lots less resistance. School nights had a couple other rules but that was mostly my brothers.", "NAH.

As a parent of 2 young children this is not how you respond to a fun aunt who offers to watch your kids for free and provide a night of fun. If he\u2019s too young for looser rules, he should stay home with mom.", "NTA, the kid's just too young to be in this situation. Your sister wants you to babysit him and give him special rules while 4 other children have all the fun? What's the fun in this for absolutely anyone?

Again, she can decline", "NAH.\n\nShe's the mom, she gets to decide how she wants to raise her child, and none of her rules sound unreasonable for a 4 year old. It actually sounds like good, structured parenting.\n\nYou're also not obligated to take care of him or invite him if you don't want to adhere to those rules. It's your party.\n\nIt does suck for the kid that you're both being stubborn and he's the one that gets punished for the fact that nobody can bend and everyone wants to argue instead of finding a middle ground (like maybe he comes over for a couple hours and his mom's rules are followed, but doesn't stay the night and after 6pm the older kids get more freedom), but everyone is allowed to have their boundaries. And 4 is a little young for a sleepover like this anyway, so I don't think it will cause him any long term damage to stick to his routine at home. Hopefully he gets plenty of other opportunities to bond with you and his cousins in ways that are more age appropriate for him.", "NTA.  If they did all that stuff every day, or even every week, it would be bad for them.  But letting loose every down and then at Auntie\u2019s house?  Go for it!   I has STRICT rules about some of these things for my kids.  But at a special party? Forget it.  Let them have fun.

He's apparently not old enough to spend a night having fun with his cousins (that's her call to make), and she can decide when he is, probably 16 or 17 from the sound of her.\n\nAnd it's ridiculous to suggest you should ignore the older kids so you can wrestle an unwilling 4yr old into the bath and then stare at him like he's microwave popcorn about to burn to make sure no one lets him have something good to eat and then force him to go to bed before anyone else is anywhere close to it. \n\nBottom line, it'll be a night of miserable 4yr old tantrums instead of the fun filled cousin's night you want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can have lots of great memories without everyone having to deal with the 6-10 meltdown and refusal to sleep", "Alive, for a 3-4 year old is a job in itself.  lol.  Sis is asking a lot for her to get some free time.  For free.  NTA.", "I survived fun nights with auntie at that age with my older sisters", "Yeah I agree the potential for a meltdown of some kind is too high at this age. When I was 4 or 5, I would fully want to do a sleepover at first. But when it came time to go to bed, I would break down sobbing because I missed my parents. We had to wait until I was 6.", "This was my thought too. 4-year-olds do need that kind of routine, which is exactly why a pajama party with older kids isn't a good idea. He needs to be a few years older before he's ready.", "OP doesn't say how long this tradition has been going on but use of HOLIDAYS seems to indicate it's been a few years at the very least--so OP has likely dealt with a 4 yr old before(ages 7-10) if it's gone on for more then 3 yrs. \n\nI believe a parent has the right to have guidelines for their kids with those caring for their children, but this definitely seems over the top, since it's literally a sleepover, fun thing.  \n\nSO yes, if mother had raised child to be on such a strict schedule it's up to her to say, my 4 yr old is not yet behaviorally up to this, but when kid gets older I'd welcome the chance for kid to have a cousins sleepover/fun time.", "For some 4 year olds, sure. Maybe not so much for others, and maybe his mother knows him better than the rest of us. I like the idea of Mom picking him up at 6 or 7. He'll have fun with the cousins without getting overwhelmed.", "You could get lucky and they fall asleep. Or you could end up with a four year old having a meltdown at 10 pm because they wanted to stay up and have fun with their cousins (like eating all those treats!) and no one told them they couldn't, so now that kid is super overstimulated and exhausted.", "My rule is I don't care how much sugar you eat as long as you eat your veggies. I also buy their favorites and have all the good snacks. You know...for consistency.", "Love it! Your great aunt had figured some shit out for sure! Also a really good way of becoming the favorite aunt", "I love old people like this who have clearly taken their life lessons to heart and live it out every day", "And OP explained that they would not be able to give one child as much attention as mom wanted. No blood, no foul.", "A mild stomach ache is not the same as playing with matches. \ud83d\ude44", "Not when you don\u2019t let a toddler go buffet style on candy.", "That doesn\u2019t make OP the AH. OP is stating the care she is prepared to provide. If mom thinks kid isn\u2019t old enough for that relaxed a structure, mom can say so.", "It\u2019s a one time special event, not every night.", "It depends on the kid. Some kids--like my autistic daughter--need schedules, and some kids have been on such strict schedules they're so used to them that they don't react well off them. Four is an interesting age, they often seem so much older, but if anything goes off, they can regress to toddlerhood. Sounds to me that he's just not mature enough for this party, and that's OK.", "Well great", "Ya that\u2019s an option. I just think of my sister and all her rules around her kids and I think.. probably unnecessary, and the kids is probably fine to stay.. and if he falls asleep eating candy and playing video games with his cousins for a night.. who cares (other then Mom lol)", "My dad's reasoning as to why cake for breakfast is ok is similar, it's carbs and sugar, what is jam on toast if not carbs and sugar?", "I once tried the argue to my mom that we could eat cake for breakfast since it was basically the same thing as donuts, and she just said we shouldn\u2019t be eating donuts for breakfast either \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "She was really something else. Her house was grandfathered in on a national park and even though the government kept offering her millions of dollars she kept telling them to fuck off. \u201cMy grandfather built this house and no amount of money is going to make me leave it.\u201d Easily the favorite aunt.", "May you have the cake day you deserve", "He does not need to be Learning[tm] every second of everyday. He can have the occasional day of goofing off with relatives.", "Yes, that is why it is voted a No Assholes Here situation.", "Oh quit be such a sour puss. No one is saying let the kid go buffet style just having a little more than usual. A 4 year old is also not a toddler. At four years old he should be in his last year of preschool. Most kids start kindergarten at age 5 in the US. If the parents think he is too young to handle it then they should keep him home until he is older. My kids and their friends were always allowed to do whatever on sleepovers as long as it wasn\u2019t dangerous. I never had to clean up vomit. Kids learn how to make good choices with some freedom to over indulge.", "But the point is that she doesn\u2019t get credit for \u201ctrying to include all the niblings\u201d if she\u2019s not prepared to adequately manage the 4 year old. She\u2019s not really trying to include them all. The moms expectations aren\u2019t unreasonable.", "Your dad's reasoning is very sound", "Love it even more! Something about old ladies telling the government to piss off whilst having dessert is just fantastic!", "Awesome! I didn't realize we were agreeing so vehemently.", "I\u2019m only going by OP words \u2026\u201d I wouldn\u2019t control how much candy they eat\u201d. Now I agree the more prudent choice would be mom would realize this isn\u2019t a good fit.", "Meh, I disagree, but we'll have to agree to disagree on this.", "She invited him and is offering certain things that are not unreasonable for a day. That is adequately trying to include him. She does not have to cater to mom\u2019s every whim.", "Maybe you should stop replying with the same information if you are confused about whether we are agreeing or not then?", "YTA. This kid is 4. It's fine if you tell her that you don't feel equipped to manage a child that young, but everything the mom requested is pretty standard procedure when caring for a child that age. And if you were the sole adult, how would you not see your role as this kid's babysitter? Do you honestly think a 4 year old doesn't need one? This is just bizarre. After listening to what you had to say, if I were the mom, there is no way on Earth I'd be leaving my kid alone with you because I'd have serious concerns about my kid's safety, particularly with a pool there.  \n\n\nEdit: To clarify, my judgment of YTA is based on how she reacted to what her sister said. Not realizing what a 4-year-old's needs are is understandable, and determining after listening to her sister that she's not able to care for this kid is also understandable. But I think the way she responded to the sister is what makes her TA.", "NTA. You want the kids to have fun with aunty, your sister wants free babysitting. Free babysitting isn't what you're offering. She should hire a babysitter.", "Mostly NTA - I would ask that you watch the sugar intake so as 4 yr old doesn't get sick (7yr old can tolerate a bit more than a 4 yr old) but other than that I think your sister's rules for bedtime and bathtime are ridiculous. \n\nYour house, your nephew party - your rules. Sister is the one keeping her son from being able to have fun and play with his cousins, not you.", "NTA.  I truly don't understand the limitation on play time.  Tell her the entire weekend is play time!  Her rules won't be able to work at your home - her son won't stop playing when the others are still having fun and you're not going to ask the others to be quiet when it's the 4 year old's bedtime.  Her rules and your party are not compatible.\nTell her that he's welcome to joint the fun at your home when his schedule isn't so rigid.", "NTA she wanted more than what you offered. So the offer should be off the table.", "NTA. I would have agreed and then just disregarded the rules.", "Aww I'm sorry to hear it. May she rest in peace", "NTA she can keep her son at home with her!!", "NTA;  You are the fun aunt.  Your sister doesn't get to be upset that the *fun* ain't isn't a babysitter or governess.\n\nHer rules are reasonable for a kid that age but not yours to apply.", "NTA, I\u2019m an aunt and do the same except I learned the hard way to limit sugar. Some kids can\u2019t tell when they\u2019re about to puke from eating too much junk food.", "NTA\n\nIt's her choice. If she wants to regulate it she needs to look after him herself/with his dad. If she wants to accept the invite she needs to accept the rules are looser.", "Honestly, I would have done this as a parent when my kid was that age- I would have let him have a good time with his cousins, but my kid was VERY routine-regimented at that age, and it was not worth it to anyone letting him kick back and relax and go to bed late even for one night, because he'd be a monster for days, so I would have picked him up early. I definitely would not ask an unchilded relative to strictly adhere to his routine when they are dealing with four other young children- he may have been a little beast about such matters at that age, but he was my little beast and my responsibility.\n\nOh, and he's a teenager and far more flexible now, lol.", "This isn't the route to go. OP should offer what she *can* do - early bedtime for the 4yo and not overdoing the candy is reasonable. Bath time is not. OP can also offer for her sister to pick up nephew early. A 4yo shouldn't be staying overnight anyway.", "> the \u201cbed time\u201d routine.\n\nMost\n\n> kids his age need that kind of routine\n\n, I think.", "She died of ovarian cancer a few years ago.", "Yep. I grew up in the late 70's/early 80's and the days when parents put us all in one room with the older kids and we fell asleep in a pile of coats are long gone. My guess is this kid is help so hard and fast to his parents' schedule that he'd melt down that night and the next day.", "because those two are exactly the same and playing with fire has no potential for much greater harm than eating a bit too much candy.", "I don't see any reason why a 4 yr old can't have a fun night, more then likely he would just fall asleep on the couch when he's tired.", "My kids and their cousins had a blast with cousin/ aunties visits. Ranging from like 8- newborn. You just roll with it. One or two nights won't ruin them. You plan and have \"quiet time\" in some form the next day to have their brains chill, like playdough, movie, cuddling and reading, there's so much. They're not going to turn into Gremlins after 8pm. And my kids at 4 had a bedtime of 7/730 lol.", "Those were some fun nights, I tell you.", "I didn't say he needed to be learning every second. You're right, that would be ridiculous. Good thing nobody proposed that.", "He\u2019s only allowed 2 hours of play. His mom *is* proposing something silly like that.", "Since when is \"2 hours of play\" the same as \"has to be learning every second of everyday?\" Those are two completely opposite statements."]}
