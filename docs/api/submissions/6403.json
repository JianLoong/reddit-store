Your comment was pretty funny and not an indication that you felt people needed to be married to have kids.

You were responding in the context of someone else's comment, and she took it personally because she's probably sensitive about it due to the same kinds of beliefs and  comments you get thrown at you. \n\nThe coworker that made the original comment is the only asshole.", "NTA \nIf she feels some sort of way that\u2019s on her. Nothing was said that implied unmarried parents don\u2019t give kids a good life. \n\nShe should have walked away when the topic came up if she felt uncomfortable with her situation", "**NAH** You did the right thing by agreeing with her.  She can be sensitive without anyone being an asshole.", "NTA: you were making a joke, at your own expense, not passing judgment on your coworkers.\n\nThat being said, she may have pressure to get married from friends and family. For instance my dad used to call my son the bastard in a \u201c joking\u201d way because I wasn\u2019t married when I had him. It hurt every time, it made me super over sensitive to marriage jokes. It took me a long time to realize that I wasn\u2019t the problem", "NTA. Your coworker is sensitive, and knowing that I wouldn't make those jokes around her in future, but if you didn't know and were joking around about your own kid, you're fine.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a joke, one at your own expense at that. It wasn\u2019t directed at anyone else or told maliciously.", "NAH - Just a joke without intention to harm no one.", "NAH - it was just a joke, can\u2019t blame you since you were put on the spot.", "NTA. Some people just get way to offended.", "NAH.\n\nI don't blame her for taking offense, it's a pretty lousy thing to say about a child (as if whether they're a \"legitimate\" human has something to do with their parents' actions that brought about their existence).  At the same time, I got a chuckle out of it, and since you were really just poking fun at your own personal circumstances there's no ill intent on your part.\n\nIf she still seems off about it, I'd talk to her alone to apologize more formally, but there's a good chance she's over it by now anyway. Make sure you don't repeat that joke around her in any case.", "NAH - You made a self deprecating joke; she's a bit sensitive, maybe it hit a nerve in her own life. Let it go and don't mention it around her again, now that you know.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nYou were joking with someone over a shotgun wedding & made a joke.

You are an AH for using such outdated vocabulary. I suppose you wouldn't use the n-word either?", "I\u2019m gonna say accidental AH. Personally, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. But if you\u2019ve ever had any type of HR training at this job or others, even a joke about your son in the workplace could be found offensive. That seems to be what this coworkers issue is. We unfortunately, live in a world where if anyone is offended by something in the workplace then you are wrong. Hopefully nothing else comes of this but there are people out there that would go to HR and complain because you made her feel uncomfortable.
