We were at this pretty nice restaurant and our waitress (F, early 20s) caught my eye as soon as we sat down. I thought she was really cute and had a great sense of style. Her outfit was really unique and just seemed to suit her perfectly.\n\nAnyway, throughout the night, she was really friendly and attentive, and I couldn't help but keep noticing her. After a while, I decided to go for it and compliment her on her outfit. I said something like, \"Hey, I just wanted to say that you look really cute tonight and your outfit is amazing. It suits you so well.\" She seemed to take the compliment well, smiling and thanking me.\n\nLater on, as we were finishing up our meal, I decided to write my number on the receipt and leave it for her, just in case she was interested in talking more or even going on a date. When I handed her the receipt, I told her, \"I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\"\n\nShe took the receipt and thanked me, but I noticed her smile seemed a bit forced this time. I figured maybe she wasn't interested, and that was fine. I didn't want to push her or make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nAfter we left the restaurant, my friends told me that what I did was inappropriate and that I shouldn't have put her on the spot like that at her workplace. They said it's not okay to hit on service workers who are just trying to do their job. I genuinely didn't mean any harm, and I thought I was being polite and respectful about it.", "created_utc": 1682974152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1350ul3/aita_for_leaving_my_number_on_the_bill/", "score": 225, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s a server and is paid to provide you with good service. The fact that she was friendly and attentive does not mean that she\u2019s into you.

It's her job to be friendly and attentive. Complimenting her that specifically in front of everyone is already putting her in an awkward spot, because again, she can't really do anything other than thank you and smile \u2013 which is obviously something you may interpret as more, because you did. Writing your number on the bill without saying anything would have been a bit off-putting, but not terrible.

She's paid to be nice to you. She must get tons of guys hitting on her everyday at her job, it's exhausting.

The woman is a server, it's her job to be friendly to customers.", "YTA.

Smiling, laughing and being friendly are part of her job.

I couldn't say no but I hoped he never came back again. \n\n\nMy point is that I was polite because that was my job and I gave a simple, short compliment. Not flirting or anything.

Impressive.\n\nYTA creep.", ">When I handed her the receipt, I told her, \"I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\"\n\n\nThis was a faux pas on your part, but I'll go with NAH since it wasn't intentional. What you did puts a service-worker in an awkward spot when you say it directly at them in front of other customers like that, especially since you were *holding* the receipt (which presumably has her tip on it) while saying all of this instead of letting her pick it up and go about her work.  So she needs to act nice in order to get that piece of paper from you to get paid. In someone else's eyes holding the receipt could be perceived like you're withholding her wages until you decide whether or not you like her response to your proposal, and trying to be coy about it like *\"Hah, I've got your tip here, wanna know what it is? How about you agree to go out with me first?\"*\n\nI understand that this ***wasn't*** your intention and you did try to leave it up to her, but what you need to understand is that it can very easily feel like the scenario above to someone who has to play along for creeps day in and day out who DO intend stuff like that. It gets exhausting to keep the chipper smile for 8+hrs in a tip-based industry, and for some people the middle of their shift isn't an environment where they'd even be able to recognize \"real\" chemistry even if it hit them in the face. It's harder to appreciate nuances in pleasant conversation when part of your job is to make people feel good, because even if your convo IS going well, she still has to interpret it through a lens of *\"Ok, how do I KEEP them happy?\"*. It adds a social pressure behind the scenes that affects her perception of it.\n\nNext time, just write \"loved chatting with you, shoot me a text if you want to hang out sometime\" with your number on it, give it to her without saying anything extra that she has to actually respond to on the spot like that (especially at work right in front of her other customers AND her coworkers) and let her decide whether to take you up on it or not.\n\nIn an ideal world just write it on a separate piece of paper altogether (or business card or napkin or something) so it's not on the receipt she has to bring back to the register. It's possible she might not be the one that rings up or files the final receipts and she could get teased about notes like that when her boss/ coworkers see that customers are giving her numbers. Especially if she has a SO but has to act friendly at work. Or just doesn't want to be teased in general.", "She was nice and attentive because it's her job. I thought it was common knowledge that hitting on people while they're working isn't okay? YTA. Stop doing that", "You were annoying, but that's a venial sin.\n\nYour number wound up in the trash and that's how these things go.\n\nDon't flirt with people at work. You know better.", "I've served for a while and just to break down what went through my head reading this... \n\n>Throughout the night, she was really friendly and attentive.\n\nThat's her job. \n\n>I decided to go for it and compliment her on her outfit.\n\nOk, that's alright. Nothing wrong with complimenting an outfit. You wanted to compliment something she has control over and clearly puts effort into. \n\n>I just wanted to say that you look really cute tonight and your outfit is amazing. It suits you so well.\n\nWait... looks cute \"tonight\"? How do you know what she looks like every other night. It suits her? You don't know her.... This whole wording just gives me creepy crawlies. \n\n>She seemed to take the compliment well, smiling and thanking me.\n\nWhat else was she supposed to do? You are a paying customer and she's a service worker. She probably felt at this point her tip was reliant on her response. \n\n>I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\n\nWere you actually talking to her that night? Like more so than how she talked to anyone else at your table? Or was she just good at her job? \n\nYour friends are right, it's not ok to hit on service workers. Everything you described on her part wasn't flirtatious, she was just working. If she was talking to you more than the other guests or if she followed up your compliment with a compliment for you it might have been a bit different. But she was on the receiving end of unwanted attention that she didn't reciprocate at any point. What made you think she would be interested in going out with you other than \"she caught your eye\"?. \n\nYTA. Hopefully you use this as a learning experience and read the room. She didn't give you any inclination that she would be interested, you simply thought she was cute.", "YTA.

She's working and probably needs the tip too.", "She was nice and attentive because it\u2019s her JOB that\u2019s how she makes tips. It is not because she is Interested in you.

You were kind enough, but just understand how uncomfortable you made her. And don\u2019t do it again please. YTA.", "The whole point of giving your number when you leave instead of asking for hers or asking her out is supposed to be to not put her on the spot. By brining it up instead of just writing it you put her on the spot defeating the point of your attempt to be respectful about it.", "Did you grab her hand when she took the receipt from her too? YTA. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve felt trapped when men made unwelcome advances at me, including grabbing my hand when I reached out to take their payment.", "Soft YTA. She is at work, doing her job. Which is to be nice and friendly to her customers - as a waitress her income depends on that.\n\nYou are in a position of power over her, however temporarily, and that's not okay.", "YTA\n\nShe is only doing it because it is her job. That it is. It is her job to be nice so you will tip her with money so she can pay her bills. As one myself, never hit on a service worker. Period.", "Lmao yeah dude, YTA.  She's just doing her job.  Take the L and move on", "YTA gross", "You shouldn\u2019t hit on people at their job and put them on the spot. YTA for that. It would be less AH if you put your number down and left it on the table in a nonchalant manner, but handing it to her makes it very AH. Do better.", "I think you unintentionally fall into YTA, but it's a soft one. It sounds like you were trying to be polite and not overbearing. However she was a work and literally is paid to be polite, this means that you cannot take any interaction with sincerity. I understand wanting to put yourself out there and try, and I think you did it about as respectfully as you knew how. I would have maybe said something less personal when you complimented her, because \"that suits you\" makes it sound like you know her. \"I love your outfit\" would have been simpler and likely more effective.\n\nPutting your number on the receipt I think was fine, it can be flattering sometimes to know people want to get to know you. Saying something when you handed it to her was a bit too much and you did put her on the spot. Maybe just add something like \"I'd love to see you outside of work if you're interested\" to the number and leave it alone. Then there no pressure from her to respond. \n\nI know I'm going to get a lot of hate from this, but how the heck else are you supposed to meet people organically in the real world if you don't try? As long as you accept \"no\" gracefully I think this is usually acceptable.", "NT necessarily TA, just clueless about social conventions and work obligations. She was being nice to you because it's her job and it gets her a bigger tip. You misread the situation.", "NTA- As a former waitress myself I think you didn't do anything wrong since you were respectful and everything but it is very uncomfortable when men are hitting on you while you work and many assume you are interested in them because you have to be polite and not just send them somewhere when they get a bit to far, so I get where your friends were coming from. If what you wrote is all you did you are completely in the clear.", "NTA. I waitressed when I was younger and had no problem when a guy was nice about trying to ask me out at work. The way that you did it was tasteful and not at all pushy. It's not a big deal and if she's not interested, she just won't call. If she had a problem with it, then the issue lies with her.", "Am I the only one that thinks NTA? \n\nHe shot his shot. From what I read, it didn\u2019t seem rude. He waited until the end of the meal to do it just in case it did get awkward. He gave her the number and he isn\u2019t making her call him. IF he just showed up and asked why she hasn\u2019t called yet, then I\u2019d say he was an AH.", "NTA, is there any place that redditors deem socially acceptable to ask someone out?  As long as you take rejection well and don't make her uncomfortable going forward you're not doing anything wrong.", "Damn guess I\u2019m in the minority but NTA. you didn\u2019t put her on the spot by actually asking her out. You gave her your number and said IF she is interested, She can call You. And you did it at the end, so if she\u2019s not it wouldn\u2019t have to be unpleasant the whole time. \nYou were polite and didn\u2019t put her on the spot and gave her the decision making. I see nothing wrong with that", "As a 40+ yr old server I wouldn't be offended I would've laughed it off, however as a 20 something yr old I would've been uncomfortable.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say NTA\n\nI think there's a lot of folks in the service industry that are jaded by creepy old men who hit on teenagers. If you were making inappropriate comments, getting physical, or otherwise being rude, that would have been different. It might have been a little awkward when you last spoke to her, but anytime you ask someone out, it's awkward. There's no situation where it isn't. I also don't think you cornered her either, you offered it to her and left the ball in her court, you didn't pressure her for an answer or anything like that. I think you were very polite about it.\n\nYeah it might be annoying to be hit on when you're not interested, especially when you're working, but if no one mustered the courage to make that first step, none of us would be here. When else are you going to see this person?

She's in a position where her pay is dependent upon you, the person hitting on her, giving her a good tip.\n\nThink about that dynamic for a second and then ask yourself if it's a great idea. Especially on the check itself.", "Once again this sub is so backwards, you did nothing wrong, you literally put yourself out there", "YTA\n\nYour friends are right, do not flirt with women who are working, not to mention that she's not even legally and adult in the states and you are near your 30s...\n\nOf course she seemed nice and friendly, it's her job, but I assure you that no 20 year old is interested in the 26 year old from table 6 ogling her outfit. Even your own friends called you out dude.", "YTA for making your comments and verbally telling her you're leaving your number. That's just so cringe.. and super uncomfortable. If you just discreetly left your number without all the weird compliments and telling her you want to go out with her, then I'd say NTA.", "Lord almighty. She wasn't interested, man. She is PAID to be nice. She wanted a good tip. Otherwise, she would have told you where to shove it. \n\nYTA creep.\n\nYou think strippers like you too, don't you?", "There is an unwritten rule about asking girls out at work.\n\nIf there really is a spark, she will leave her number on the back of the receipt for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappened once to me and everyone at the table went into as much shock as I did.\n\nI had seen the waitress at work many times and wanted to say something but its taboo.\n\nEnd of the night when I got my bill her name and phone number were on the back.\n\nOnce she opens the door it's ok but until then she is working and it's just service baby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Ex is a bartender and they flirt all day for tips.

Firstly, you were out with your friends. At no point did I feel like you were sat alone, ordered one coffee for the free refill, and just sat and stared at her all night like an asshole would do. Secondly, someone being nice and attentive at their place of work, especially in hospitality, is pretty standard. But isn\u2019t that the characteristics you look for when you find someone attractive? How they are with people and how they response to what you say? If OP had said that she looked sexy and he was attracted to her because she has massive boobs and that\u2019s the only reason he left his number, then 100%, he would be an asshole, hands down! But someone catching your eye and then they follow it up by being a genuine and nice person is something to find attractive in a person. And thirdly, he was respectful and polite by leaving his number on a receipt. I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t the first to leave his number, and probably won\u2019t be the last, but it\u2019s a very indirect way of saying \u201chey, I thought you were nice, here\u2019s my number if you\u2019d like to talk sometime\u201d. He didn\u2019t harass her and demand her number in his phone so he could bombard her with messages (aka an asshole move), nor forced her to message him before he left so he had her number as well. Maybe some could argue that making her aware of the number might be a bit asshole-ish, but again, context matters. He was most likely sat with a group of lads, and leaving your number on a receipt from \u201cMark\u201d could be any one of them; so he wanted to be sure she connected the dots and knew it was him, from the rapport they built through their interactions. And lastly, the woman could have simply screwed up the receipt and threw it in the bin if she didn\u2019t want it or felt like it was a dick move, which, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here guys, is the whole point of writing your number down on a piece of paper to give to a woman anyway. If she\u2019s not interested, so be it. It\u2019s a very simple way of saying no without issue. \n\nMy question, to all those who think a guy leaving his number for a woman in this kind of situation, or any where people interact for that matter, is an asshole move and is considered harassment; how do you expect to meet people? How do you expect to date anyone? How do you even keep in contact with someone if you were hiking in a group together and had a good conversation the whole way? If your answer is \u201cthere\u2019s apps for that\u201d then the people in their 20\u2019s have seriously lost touch with what it means to be human if you have to sort and filter your interactions with other people via apps and not in person using the tried and tested method of \u201chmmm, he/she has a really nice personality and can hold a conversation, I think I\u2019ll offer them my number\u201d\u2026 \ud83d\ude24\n\n(sorry for the rant-y comment OP)", "NAH, barely - You shot your shot.

It is a fine line between gentle flirting and harassing so keep that in mind and just write down your number on the receipt so she can pick it up and decide when you\u2019re not immediately in front of her and other customers. \n\nAs a former male bartender I got flirted with a lot but I know women hear all day every day and in a restaurant setting it can be kind of extreme from what I\u2019ve heard and seen.

We were at this pretty nice restaurant and our waitress (F, early 20s) caught my eye as soon as we sat down. I thought she was really cute and had a great sense of style. Her outfit was really unique and just seemed to suit her perfectly.\n\nAnyway, throughout the night, she was really friendly and attentive, and I couldn't help but keep noticing her. After a while, I decided to go for it and compliment her on her outfit. I said something like, \"Hey, I just wanted to say that you look really cute tonight and your outfit is amazing. It suits you so well.\" She seemed to take the compliment well, smiling and thanking me.\n\nLater on, as we were finishing up our meal, I decided to write my number on the receipt and leave it for her, just in case she was interested in talking more or even going on a date. When I handed her the receipt, I told her, \"I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\"\n\nShe took the receipt and thanked me, but I noticed her smile seemed a bit forced this time. I figured maybe she wasn't interested, and that was fine. I didn't want to push her or make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nAfter we left the restaurant, my friends told me that what I did was inappropriate and that I shouldn't have put her on the spot like that at her workplace. They said it's not okay to hit on service workers who are just trying to do their job. I genuinely didn't mean any harm, and I thought I was being polite and respectful about it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People have given me free stuff because I was a loyal customer, as others have noted, or because I was kind to someone after they had a shit day dealing with rude customers.
