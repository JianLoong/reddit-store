We were at this pretty nice restaurant and our waitress (F, early 20s) caught my eye as soon as we sat down. I thought she was really cute and had a great sense of style. Her outfit was really unique and just seemed to suit her perfectly.\n\nAnyway, throughout the night, she was really friendly and attentive, and I couldn't help but keep noticing her. After a while, I decided to go for it and compliment her on her outfit. I said something like, \"Hey, I just wanted to say that you look really cute tonight and your outfit is amazing. It suits you so well.\" She seemed to take the compliment well, smiling and thanking me.\n\nLater on, as we were finishing up our meal, I decided to write my number on the receipt and leave it for her, just in case she was interested in talking more or even going on a date. When I handed her the receipt, I told her, \"I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\"\n\nShe took the receipt and thanked me, but I noticed her smile seemed a bit forced this time. I figured maybe she wasn't interested, and that was fine. I didn't want to push her or make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nAfter we left the restaurant, my friends told me that what I did was inappropriate and that I shouldn't have put her on the spot like that at her workplace. They said it's not okay to hit on service workers who are just trying to do their job. I genuinely didn't mean any harm, and I thought I was being polite and respectful about it.", "created_utc": 1682974152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1350ul3/aita_for_leaving_my_number_on_the_bill/", "score": 3173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Impressive.\n\nYTA creep.", ">When I handed her the receipt, I told her, \"I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\"\n\n\nThis was a faux pas on your part, but I'll go with NAH since it wasn't intentional. What you did puts a service-worker in an awkward spot when you say it directly at them in front of other customers like that, especially since you were *holding* the receipt (which presumably has her tip on it) while saying all of this instead of letting her pick it up and go about her work.  So she needs to act nice in order to get that piece of paper from you to get paid. In someone else's eyes holding the receipt could be perceived like you're withholding her wages until you decide whether or not you like her response to your proposal, and trying to be coy about it like *\"Hah, I've got your tip here, wanna know what it is? How about you agree to go out with me first?\"*\n\nI understand that this ***wasn't*** your intention and you did try to leave it up to her, but what you need to understand is that it can very easily feel like the scenario above to someone who has to play along for creeps day in and day out who DO intend stuff like that. It gets exhausting to keep the chipper smile for 8+hrs in a tip-based industry, and for some people the middle of their shift isn't an environment where they'd even be able to recognize \"real\" chemistry even if it hit them in the face. It's harder to appreciate nuances in pleasant conversation when part of your job is to make people feel good, because even if your convo IS going well, she still has to interpret it through a lens of *\"Ok, how do I KEEP them happy?\"*. It adds a social pressure behind the scenes that affects her perception of it.\n\nNext time, just write \"loved chatting with you, shoot me a text if you want to hang out sometime\" with your number on it, give it to her without saying anything extra that she has to actually respond to on the spot like that (especially at work right in front of her other customers AND her coworkers) and let her decide whether to take you up on it or not.\n\nIn an ideal world just write it on a separate piece of paper altogether (or business card or napkin or something) so it's not on the receipt she has to bring back to the register. It's possible she might not be the one that rings up or files the final receipts and she could get teased about notes like that when her boss/ coworkers see that customers are giving her numbers. Especially if she has a SO but has to act friendly at work. Or just doesn't want to be teased in general.", "She was nice and attentive because it's her job. I thought it was common knowledge that hitting on people while they're working isn't okay? YTA. Stop doing that", "You were annoying, but that's a venial sin.\n\nYour number wound up in the trash and that's how these things go.\n\nDon't flirt with people at work. You know better.", "I've served for a while and just to break down what went through my head reading this... \n\n>Throughout the night, she was really friendly and attentive.\n\nThat's her job. \n\n>I decided to go for it and compliment her on her outfit.\n\nOk, that's alright. Nothing wrong with complimenting an outfit. You wanted to compliment something she has control over and clearly puts effort into. \n\n>I just wanted to say that you look really cute tonight and your outfit is amazing. It suits you so well.\n\nWait... looks cute \"tonight\"? How do you know what she looks like every other night. It suits her? You don't know her.... This whole wording just gives me creepy crawlies. \n\n>She seemed to take the compliment well, smiling and thanking me.\n\nWhat else was she supposed to do? You are a paying customer and she's a service worker. She probably felt at this point her tip was reliant on her response. \n\n>I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\n\nWere you actually talking to her that night? Like more so than how she talked to anyone else at your table? Or was she just good at her job? \n\nYour friends are right, it's not ok to hit on service workers. Everything you described on her part wasn't flirtatious, she was just working. If she was talking to you more than the other guests or if she followed up your compliment with a compliment for you it might have been a bit different. But she was on the receiving end of unwanted attention that she didn't reciprocate at any point.

You were kind enough, but just understand how uncomfortable you made her. And don\u2019t do it again please. YTA.", "The whole point of giving your number when you leave instead of asking for hers or asking her out is supposed to be to not put her on the spot. By brining it up instead of just writing it you put her on the spot defeating the point of your attempt to be respectful about it.", "Did you grab her hand when she took the receipt from her too? YTA. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve felt trapped when men made unwelcome advances at me, including grabbing my hand when I reached out to take their payment.", "Soft YTA. She is at work, doing her job.

Do better.", "I think you unintentionally fall into YTA, but it's a soft one. It sounds like you were trying to be polite and not overbearing. However she was a work and literally is paid to be polite, this means that you cannot take any interaction with sincerity. I understand wanting to put yourself out there and try, and I think you did it about as respectfully as you knew how. I would have maybe said something less personal when you complimented her, because \"that suits you\" makes it sound like you know her. \"I love your outfit\" would have been simpler and likely more effective.\n\nPutting your number on the receipt I think was fine, it can be flattering sometimes to know people want to get to know you. Saying something when you handed it to her was a bit too much and you did put her on the spot. Maybe just add something like \"I'd love to see you outside of work if you're interested\" to the number and leave it alone. Then there no pressure from her to respond. \n\nI know I'm going to get a lot of hate from this, but how the heck else are you supposed to meet people organically in the real world if you don't try? As long as you accept \"no\" gracefully I think this is usually acceptable.", "NT necessarily TA, just clueless about social conventions and work obligations.

You misread the situation.", "NTA- As a former waitress myself I think you didn't do anything wrong since you were respectful and everything but it is very uncomfortable when men are hitting on you while you work and many assume you are interested in them because you have to be polite and not just send them somewhere when they get a bit to far, so I get where your friends were coming from. If what you wrote is all you did you are completely in the clear.", "NTA. I waitressed when I was younger and had no problem when a guy was nice about trying to ask me out at work.

If she had a problem with it, then the issue lies with her.", "Am I the only one that thinks NTA? \n\nHe shot his shot. From what I read, it didn\u2019t seem rude.

IF he just showed up and asked why she hasn\u2019t called yet, then I\u2019d say he was an AH.", "NTA, is there any place that redditors deem socially acceptable to ask someone out?  As long as you take rejection well and don't make her uncomfortable going forward you're not doing anything wrong.", "Damn guess I\u2019m in the minority but NTA. you didn\u2019t put her on the spot by actually asking her out. You gave her your number and said IF she is interested, She can call You. And you did it at the end, so if she\u2019s not it wouldn\u2019t have to be unpleasant the whole time. \nYou were polite and didn\u2019t put her on the spot and gave her the decision making.

If you were making inappropriate comments, getting physical, or otherwise being rude, that would have been different. It might have been a little awkward when you last spoke to her, but anytime you ask someone out, it's awkward. There's no situation where it isn't. I also don't think you cornered her either, you offered it to her and left the ball in her court, you didn't pressure her for an answer or anything like that. I think you were very polite about it.\n\nYeah it might be annoying to be hit on when you're not interested, especially when you're working, but if no one mustered the courage to make that first step, none of us would be here.

As long as once she says no you leave her alone which it seems like you did.", "Woooooow I can\u2019t believe the amount of yta\u2019s in this thread\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, downvote me if you need to, but I\u2019m gonna have to fight the tide on this one!\n\nNTA, and here\u2019s my opinion (I doubt OP will read this but either way) why: I don\u2019t think you were an asshole here at all. Firstly, you were out with your friends. At no point did I feel like you were sat alone, ordered one coffee for the free refill, and just sat and stared at her all night like an asshole would do. Secondly, someone being nice and attentive at their place of work, especially in hospitality, is pretty standard. But isn\u2019t that the characteristics you look for when you find someone attractive? How they are with people and how they response to what you say? If OP had said that she looked sexy and he was attracted to her because she has massive boobs and that\u2019s the only reason he left his number, then 100%, he would be an asshole, hands down! But someone catching your eye and then they follow it up by being a genuine and nice person is something to find attractive in a person. And thirdly, he was respectful and polite by leaving his number on a receipt. I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t the first to leave his number, and probably won\u2019t be the last, but it\u2019s a very indirect way of saying \u201chey, I thought you were nice, here\u2019s my number if you\u2019d like to talk sometime\u201d. He didn\u2019t harass her and demand her number in his phone so he could bombard her with messages (aka an asshole move), nor forced her to message him before he left so he had her number as well. Maybe some could argue that making her aware of the number might be a bit asshole-ish, but again, context matters. He was most likely sat with a group of lads, and leaving your number on a receipt from \u201cMark\u201d could be any one of them; so he wanted to be sure she connected the dots and knew it was him, from the rapport they built through their interactions. And lastly, the woman could have simply screwed up the receipt and threw it in the bin if she didn\u2019t want it or felt like it was a dick move, which, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here guys, is the whole point of writing your number down on a piece of paper to give to a woman anyway. If she\u2019s not interested, so be it. It\u2019s a very simple way of saying no without issue. \n\nMy question, to all those who think a guy leaving his number for a woman in this kind of situation, or any where people interact for that matter, is an asshole move and is considered harassment; how do you expect to meet people? How do you expect to date anyone? How do you even keep in contact with someone if you were hiking in a group together and had a good conversation the whole way? If your answer is \u201cthere\u2019s apps for that\u201d then the people in their 20\u2019s have seriously lost touch with what it means to be human if you have to sort and filter your interactions with other people via apps and not in person using the tried and tested method of \u201chmmm, he/she has a really nice personality and can hold a conversation, I think I\u2019ll offer them my number\u201d\u2026 \ud83d\ude24\n\n(sorry for the rant-y comment OP)", "NAH, barely - You shot your shot.

Ignore the people calling you TA lol", "NTA\n\nYour only mistake was handing the number to her directly. Saying something nice about someone\u2019s outfit is ok (unless they tell you otherwise). It is a fine line between gentle flirting and harassing so keep that in mind and just write down your number on the receipt so she can pick it up and decide when you\u2019re not immediately in front of her and other customers. \n\nAs a former male bartender I got flirted with a lot but I know women hear all day every day and in a restaurant setting it can be kind of extreme from what I\u2019ve heard and seen.

We were at this pretty nice restaurant and our waitress (F, early 20s) caught my eye as soon as we sat down. I thought she was really cute and had a great sense of style. Her outfit was really unique and just seemed to suit her perfectly.\n\nAnyway, throughout the night, she was really friendly and attentive, and I couldn't help but keep noticing her. After a while, I decided to go for it and compliment her on her outfit. I said something like, \"Hey, I just wanted to say that you look really cute tonight and your outfit is amazing. It suits you so well.\" She seemed to take the compliment well, smiling and thanking me.\n\nLater on, as we were finishing up our meal, I decided to write my number on the receipt and leave it for her, just in case she was interested in talking more or even going on a date. When I handed her the receipt, I told her, \"I hope this isn't too forward, but I've really enjoyed talking to you tonight and thought you might like to get in touch if you're interested.\"\n\nShe took the receipt and thanked me, but I noticed her smile seemed a bit forced this time. I figured maybe she wasn't interested, and that was fine. I didn't want to push her or make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nAfter we left the restaurant, my friends told me that what I did was inappropriate and that I shouldn't have put her on the spot like that at her workplace. They said it's not okay to hit on service workers who are just trying to do their job. I genuinely didn't mean any harm, and I thought I was being polite and respectful about it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You gave her an innocent compliment, and by the end of the night, you just offered her your number directly. Was that possibly too forward? Maybe, but at least you offered her the *choice* of reaching out if she was also interested (I don't get that often, unfortunately).\n\nI agree with others that service workers being nice doesn't always equal flirting (ffs) and that you should have been more casual with it, but I feel calling you an asshole is a stretch. You seemed to have overall good intentions and weren't trying to make the waitress uncomfortable, which is really what we service-working-girlies can all but hope for since flirtatious customers are inevitable. Hopefully, you can just use this as a learning experience going forward when trying to shoot your shot with someone :)", "NAH I'm sure this is a controversial judgement.

But I don't think there's anything wrong with leaving your number and putting the ball in her hands (maybe just leave it at the table with her tip and like an arrow pointing to where you were sitting so she knows whose number it is) it's a very non confrontational way of showing interest and since you're already paid and gone doesn't put any pressure on her, she can just toss the number if she's not interested and you can't get in her face about the rejection.", "NTA!  How are we as adults suppose to meet our possible life partner if we are no longer allowed to ask someone out in any situation except for on apps??

Thats fine to do if you weren't being a creep about it. And gave her your number at the end so it wouldn't make the rest of the interaction awkward for her if she's uninterested. Nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nI agree with everyone saying she was likely just being friendly because that is literally her job. Unlikely she will call IMO, but literally no harm in giving her your number. If she doesnt want to call it ends there.\n\nNTA", "Nah. But this is a lesson learned. Compliments about a servers uniform....? Really? You said one thing to her then said \"it's been great talking to you tonight\" \"I put my number incase YOU want to get in touch\"....

For next time, \"tip her well and leave your number on the back of the receipt with a lil note that says\" I know this is probably stupid, but I thought you were beautiful and I'd like to get to know you. If you're interested, my name is... (number here or email address will get you points) shoot me a text or email. Thank you for a wonderful evening beautiful \"wink eye smiley face. If you want to land a chick, pretend to be one", "Honestly... I'm going to go against the grain and probably be downvoted to hell here a bit by saying nta. Here's why. \n\nFirst off... yta in a slight way for using this approach at her place of work, specifically. However - your approach is also the most preferred method out of all the others. You didn't hound her for HER number. You didn't whip out your phone and hand it to her. You didn't harass or berate her. You didnt blatantly or grossly hit on her throughout the whole night. Did you maybe read into her friendliness too much? Probably, because yes, it is literally her job to act that way. \n\nBUT. nta because it wasnt your intention to make her uncomfortable with it, you left her with the option to contact you at her own pace and her own time if, perhaps, she was actually interested, without the pressure of coercion like most men will do(like methods stated above). As a woman who has worked in the same service industry for a LONG time, and have been approached in much more uncomfortable ways... this was the way to go. But keep it out of that environment in the future. Use that method, say, at a bar and on a napkin or something. Not to an employee in their work place. \n\nA lot of comments here are really harsh. It's a tough world out there for dating, and it's hard to know when someone is just friendly or actually coming onto you. You weren't pushy, you weren't rude to her, you didn't pressure her. That's really good!

It only makes him stop wanting to try in a way that is actually received well in any other scenario - which, then, leads to much worse (see, for example, \"Taters\"... men seek answers, and they get them from the wrong people - Andrew tate - and it makes everything so much worse - all because we as women come down way too fucking hard on them for the littlest things) - and in turn builds up the resentment, anger and hatred we're seeing in so many men these days.

BUT it would be much worse if a customer stalked me and found me \u201coutside of work\u201d and chose to ask me out. I think should be done in a super nonchalant way, like JUST leaving your number on the check with a NOTE that says \u201cif you\u2019re interested, I would love to get in touch with you\u201d or what ever you would say to her in person. This does not put her on the spot, but also gives her the opportunity to reach out if she feels comfortable. If people are NEVER allowed to ask out any service workers, people could miss chances with maybe the love of their life?? That seems drastic to me. I think it can be done in the right way.

She took the compliment because she was forced to - you gave it to her in her place of work so she had no way of escaping it. My skin is crawling. Don\u2019t go back there, leave her in peace.", "YTA\n\nI would have said NAH if you had just left your number and left it up to her, but confronting her like that at work was not appropriate\n\nDon\u2019t apologize. If you go back to the restaurant act normally to her, leave a good but normal tip, and only talk to her about the specials of the day and act like it never happened. The first time she sees you will be mortifying for her so act normal and professional", "YTA for assuming her doing her job was flirting.", "YTA.   Yes, you mistook politeness for interest.   She was working and trying to get tips likely.", "As a former waitress and bartender I say YTA, not for leaving your number on the bill but for putting her on the spot to respond. \n\nI was never bothered by someone writing their number on the bill, and it happened a lot, to ALL of us. It's so much more common than you think, not because we're so damn irresistible (I was probably better looking than average in gen pop, but very average for the industry) but because so many people misinterpret what it means when we're friendly and attentive with customers. If a customer who is not a regular writes his number and walks out, who cares, you can throw it out and there's usually a nice tip attached. \n\nBut being put on the spot to respond is SO cringe.\n\nWhat you said, you should have written on the bill.", "YTA   .", "YTA. Don't hit on people while they're working. It's that simple.\n\nDon't go back and try to apologies (saw some comments suggesting this) as that would be even more invasive and see this as your wake up call.\n\nYou don't seem to have meant any harm by it and people make mistakes but sadly your mistake \"harmed\" someone. Do better next time and you'll avoid being an AH in the future.", "YTA, for many reasons bar giving her your number. You couldnt help but keep noticing her? Where is your self control? She's at work to do a job, not be the subject of continual male gaze. Complimenting her on her outfit is gross and creepy, she hasnt worn that to get hit on. Its her work uniform. The number bit is just odd. You haven't had anywhere near enough interaction to know whether or not that was appropriate. Hitting on women at their place of work is just not on anyway. She was just doing her job. She wasn't sending you any signals that she wanted your phone number. Dont be that man", "YTA\n\nI was a waitress and bartender for 20-years. When I did my job well, every single customer I served thought I wanted to be their friend or that I fancied them: grandmas, uncles, 5-year olds, chads like you. \n\nIt\u2019s called craft, dipshit. \n\nAsk me how many people I dated or became friends with that met as a customer: zero.", "Meh.  People like to hate on it, but I think this approach is just fine if it's as hands-off and no pressure as you just described.  And I'm a woman who's done a lot of waiting tables and been hit on both badly and nicely.  NTA", "OP shot his shot....NTA, imo everyone is dramatic", "NTA - you didn\u2019t make her answer in front of people. Women like being asked out. You didn\u2019t ruin her night. It\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nNow if you had asked her at the beginning of the meal, and publicly, that would have been not cool.", "Unpopular opinion I guess but NTA. Perhaps hitting on a server is an ah move, but the way you went about it was pretty decent imo. You didn't put her on the spot by asking for her number, you politely gave her yours, which gave her the choice of calling you or not without embarrassingly saying it to your face, and in front of your friends. I used to be a server and respect the way this is done. I politely accepted the compliment and never felt obligated to call. Can't score if you don't shoot, right?", "NTA just very creepy.", "As someone who has worked as a waitress, and usually agrees with the general consensus, I have to disagree with this one:\n\nNTA \n\nFrom what you said, you weren\u2019t creepy or sleazy or inappropriate. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with shooting your shot. It\u2019s not criminal to attempt to flirt with someone who is working. \n\nHowever, in the future, do remember that it\u2019s a waitresses job to be nice to you. And maybe avoid direct compliments in front of your entire table; it can be quite awkward for a waitress. If you\u2019re interested in someone who is serving your table, you can simply leave your number on the receipt. If they think you\u2019re cute and are interested, they might text you; they know who was sitting where at the table. But leave it at that and avoid making things awkward for them.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. People are so sensitive about this and it\u2019s crazy. If she wasn\u2019t interested she could toss it and call it a day. You yourself even recognized it. I\u2019m not sure when genuinely meeting someone became so wrong and swiping someone\u2019s catfish profile became the better alternative. Who knows what missed connection there could have been if you didn\u2019t try. You weren\u2019t pushy, creepy or annoying so you were having a human interaction. I met my husband so randomly, seized the moment and now it\u2019ll be 10 years that we have been together in October.", "I\u2019m going against the majority here, but NTA. \n\nThe way you went about it was fine. You didn\u2019t ask her for her number, you gave her yours IF she was interested to contact you. And you weren\u2019t forceful, or pushy from the sounds of it. You approached it in a respectful way.", "Don't know why everyone's so salty about this! I (M30) met my last girlfriend while she was working at a bar and I was a customer, and it became a wonderful relationship. And when I was working at a bar, I would have women hit on me /occasionally leave a number and it was great. \n\nHow else are people meant to meet? Or is it Tinder only these days?\n\nThis is when I think reddit people are seriously afraid of any IRL contact.\n\nNTA.", "I couldn\u2019t tell from this, did he just write it or say it out loud?", "Exactly", "All the outraged YTAs just show how truly sad most of the people on this sub are. Awkward sad angry people with zero social skills.", "Yeah, I'd also add that he probably should avoid going there. If he does go there this whole thing never happened and he shouldn't do any more flirting. She's just a service worker now.", "so you're saying that he's not allowed to ask out a waitress even if he's respectful and not pushy about it", "i know right? 90% of the people here are saying YTA but there's nothing wrong with shooting your shot", "I'd rather be hit on at work (relatively safe space, hopefully you have a good relationship with coworkers) then be stalked and \"conveniently\" run into.", "Don\u2019t forget that she was attentive. As their server.", "That\u2019s a stupid reason! I agree that people should not hit on other people at their place of employment but quit pretending that there are tons of acceptable places to hit on people lol! There really aren\u2019t aside from bars, clubs!", "Legit this!\n\nI'm married to a man who asked for my number when I was working behind the bar at his friend's engagement party. Together nine years this year, married three years this year, have a newborn. \n\nMeet-Cutes between customers and staff totally happen, but it HAS to be CUTE and CASUAL and NON-PRESSURING. (My now husband asked my number and then walked away cause he thought I had said no when I'd actually held my hand out for his phone, came running five feet back when he realised.)", "Same! I had men try to flirt and hit on me while working in a call center doing cold calls for unpaid surveys. The most annoying type of spam call and men treat it like a dating game, when they literally can\u2019t even see me", "I once saw a name tag that read \u201coh miss?\u201d", "Apparently I am blind", "Right?! Everyone saying she\u2019s nice because it\u2019s her job but like not all waiters/waitresses are nice. He obviously hasn\u2019t met her so he can only describe how he perceived her and tbh it was real of him to even include that she looked uncomfortable and probably forced a smile. To me it sounds like OP understood that the interest wasn\u2019t reciprocated and hopefully he won\u2019t pressure her by pursuing her further. \n\nFrom what OP described in this post he didn\u2019t  really do anything to deem he\u2019s really TA. Made it awkward at the end of the meal, yes, but I just feel like OP didn\u2019t really do anything terrible.", "Yeah I also felt successful because my gaydar was on point.  Adding queerness to the mix makes it more challenging definitely.  But also women are less threatening, that's just a statistical fact.", "Oh dear lord I\u2019m sorry. Way to go good dude friend.", "Based on the truckers I know, kinda surprised you SURVIVED that long.", "I was told that \"I sounded hot and he'd love to get me alone.\" But then a minute later was told that he wouldn't be buying whatever I was offering to upgrade. This was after spending like 10 minutes with him just hitting on me while I was trying to work. Afterwards I felt so gross and manipulated. I didn't like how people treated me and I was constantly having my time wasted. I only lasted a week there."]}
