We\u2019ve all been best friends since elementary as a trio. Back in high school, Mary confessed to me about liking James and planned to ask him out on Valentines\u2019 Day.

I fully supported her so that evening, I went over to her house to help her make chocolate for her confession.\n\nUnfortunately, James had rejected Mary and I was there to comfort her. It was awkward for maybe two days, but everything quickly went back to normal. A few months later, Mary had started seeing another mutual of ours, Eric and James had asked me out. I agreed and we started dating. I had asked Mary for her blessings and she said she was happy for us and she was over James already.\n\nEric and Mary had broken up long ago after a year of dating as with typical high school relationships. Fast forward to now, James had proposed to me on our 10th anniversary and I was ecstatic. It was romantic, at the beach, all our friends were there, etc. It was perfect. \n\nI had asked Mary to be my maid of honor because it only felt right since we had been a trio for so long. We live far away from each other now, so while we were no longer best friends, we were still extremely close and still talk once a month.\n\nWhen it came time for the wedding, everything was going perfect until Mary had shown up two hours late, drunk and screaming at us. We got into a physical alteration. We kicked, scratched and pulled each other\u2019s hair. I screamed at her to leave and that I wasn\u2019t going to have her at my wedding if she was drunk and acting this way, but she retaliated and screamed that I was a traitor and a bitch for marrying the love of her life, but she had given me her blessings!! She even helped plan my wedding!!! I couldn\u2019t understand where this came from all of a sudden. \n\nEventually some friends had escorted her out while she was crying and the rest of the wedding was tense and awkward.
