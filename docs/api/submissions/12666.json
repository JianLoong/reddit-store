Absolutely not! You don\u2019t charge guests- you were an even a really good guest to buy groceries, the meal and also clean.

She is the AH here.", "\"sure, when can I expect you to reimburse me for for groceries?\"", "NTA. Regardless of where you are financially, you don\u2019t charge your friends to stay with you when they visit. That\u2019s super weird. \n\nFrom the sound of it, she literally saved money by having her meals and groceries paid for. You sleeping in her place was no additional financial burden to her. \n\nIdk man. I think your friend was really rude and weird to you. I would never charge my friends money to sleep in my apartment for a few days.", "NTA. I'd distance myself from her too. That's not being a good friend.", "NTA - if she wanted you to pay she should have made it clear before the trip.", "NTA - You could have said you paid this amount already in groceries, and this was it. It was unfair indeed from your friend to not take it into account.", "NTA\n\nYou were not notified ahead of time that she was expecting payment and you paid for things she never asked you to pay for. She cannot just ambush you like that afterward and demand that you pay. You should not have given in just to avoid argument. If she wants to die on that hill, then maybe she isn't a friend worth keeping.", "NTAH if I\u2019m expecting a friend to visit, they sat for free, it cost me nothing to house them and Im just happy they spent the money to come to me, to hang out and see me. This is seriously a strange concept", "INFO : Did your friend invite you to visit her or was her flat a more convenient place to sleep on your trip than a hostel?", "NTA. If she invited you, and didnt bring up paying for it before she cannot pull this on you after the trip.", "NTA. I don't think she was being reasonable.", "She sounds like she has a really small hat. NTA", "NTA. You just don\u2019t charge your friends to stay over at your place. She\u2019d have to pay her rent/mortgage even if you weren\u2019t staying, so you being there has no additional cost to her.\n\nI happily let friends stay for free at my place all the time, as I love being a host, and think it\u2019s fun. Usually my friends will treat us to a nice meal out or pay for some of the activities we do together as a thank you, but it\u2019s not transactional. I host them because I want to spend time with them, simple as.", "ESH for not having this conversation upfront given the arrangement last time. There were a lot of assumptions made by both of you.", "NTA and I would like to apologize from Europe. Please know most Europeans are more hospitable then what you have experienced!", "Instead of dealing with this conflict based on miscommunication (where you have a legitimate position), you\u2019re just paying the offending bill and distancing yourself from your friend. \n\nAssuming you like this friend enough to actually value your relationship with them, you\u2019re in the wrong.  You\u2019re dropping the friendship to avoid a hard conversation, and that seems like cowardice to me. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t know that it makes you an AH. \n\nYour friend may have had reasonable reasons to believe you\u2019d pay. You did last time. By not communicating about it, you let last time become the default. \n\nNAH.", "ESH because you're distancing yourself from her without attempting to address the problem or talk to her about it at all.\n\nWhile, like other people here, I don't really think she should be charging you for the stay, it sounds like there was a precedent based on how things were handled last time, and you guys never truly communicated about expectations this time around which is on both of you. You don't know how she would have reacted if you said \"hey, I don't think it's fair for me to pay this time around,\" so I think YTA for not giving her that opportunity if she has been a good friend otherwise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A lot of it was her telling me my opinions on certain issues were wrong or mysoginistic. Things were ok but one the walk home she lectured me about a fairly tense political subject that I had been avoiding with her.
