Instead of paying for my stay I bought her groceries and took her out for a meal. I even specifically said to her \"Hey you're letting me stay rent free so im happy to buy you a weeks groceries\"  I also used my last morning to clean her apartment and tidy away any mess I had made.\n\nA day after I had got home she sent me a message asking for \u00a3120 to cover my stay. Given that I spent about that much on groceries and the meal out I felt like this was really unfair. I paid her because honestly I don't want to have an argument with her, but im probably going to distance myself from her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: Since honestly I didn't expect any kind of response im going to add some extra details\n\nI'm male and my friend is female. I did pay last time but at the time said \"since you can't spend the time i'm visiting finding a new job I'll pay you to help with bills and utilities\" and before this trip I explicity asked the question \"Is it ok if I stay again or should I find a hotel?\" Her response was \"No way hotels are super expensive\" But I do agree there might me some precedent however she never had other friends pay to stay.\n\nIt's not just this incident that has me wanting to cut contact. Generally she was very short with me and several times called me a Mysoginist. She lectured me one day about a sensitive political subject that I've been avoiding with her and then refused to listen to my views on it labeling my attempts to explain it as mysoginistic.\n\nAs for why I paid, yes it seems passive but frankly I just want to have the option for a clean cut without excess drama.  \n\n\nEdit 2: Just to futher explain things, The sensitive political subject we argued about was the War in Ukraine and the treatment of Refugees in Switzerland (where she lives).", "created_utc": 1679220410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vhdl2/aita_my_friend_expected_me_to_pay_for_my_visit/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If this was an issue like that, it might be worth it to understand where she's coming from, so as not to damage a friendship that has otherwise been close prior to this trip.\n\nThat said, I would definitely say you're NTA for not wanting to pay to stay at her place. I actually felt mad on your behalf reading that it was expected of you. Talking it out and getting the money back, or reimbursed for the groceries, or even just getting half the money back, would be more than fair. Avoiding conflict just leads to long term resentment and damaged relationships, so it's usually better to talk things out (unless it's unsafe to do so, of course). \n\nI think your post hit a bit close to home for me, because I do tend to try to pay for friends and family if I know they are struggling, and even though I don't shy away from confrontation, I still have gotten taken advantage of before and it's definitely upsetting.", "I voted before his edit and I said YTA to yourself for paying her the money after the last visit when she sent him a bill", "oooh boy This was going to be an AITA post in itself, I'm still working on the write up but. The topic was the war in Ukraine.\n\nIt's made worse by the fact she is Russian by birth and I am incredibly close with a Ukranian person. I was visiting with her when the Russian invasion began last year. I acknowledged then and now that her position is awful. She loves the country Russia but can't condone what is being done, I said to her at the start of my trip that I understood how awful the subject was for her and wouldn't ask her to talk about it.\n\nWhen I noticed a Ukranian flag flying in the city I tried to subtly take a picture for my Ukrainian friend. This launched the friend I was visiting into her rant. Essentially the country she currently lives in has done a lot for refugees from Ukraine and some people have taken advantage of that kindness and she feels its unfair, and she want's all the people from Ukraine who stay to get jobs and learn the language or go home.  \n\n\nMy view is that in crisis events there will always be people that take advantage but that being a liberal and democratic society comes with that downside. I don't like that people take advantage and I think it harms the greater cause of justice and equality when they do. I didn't really get to express any of this because when I tried to reply she just shouted her points back at me and said I couldnt possibly understand since I don't live there.  \n\n\nI got a little annoyed with her at this stage and said \"lets drop this, Your opinion is your own and I wont ever take that from you but please don't try and explain why I am not allowed an opinion It's really agravating for me\" She then said I was being a massive mysoginist and that I was like all men who talk down to women.\n\nI stormed off at this point and made my own way back to the appartment where I began to pack my bags. She sent a huge string of messages to me about how I had triggered her anxiety. I replied explaining that I wasn't trying to do that, that I fully understood her views and opinions but that I was trying to express my own. That I thought it was unfair of her to tell me my opinion wasn't valid because I didn't live there and that I wasn't the one to start the topic of conversation in the first place. She said I wasn't even allowed to explain myself because it was triggering her. \n\nShe got back to the apartment about 20 minutes after I did and saw me packing. I told her pretty clearly that I felt incredibly upset by the fact we had argued, that I never wanted that. I explained that it really hurt when she called me a mysoginist because I try incredibly hard in life not to be one and to stand up for women and womens rights. I offered to leave the following morning but she asked me to stay and said we would just move past everything. I agreed but asked if I could have some space to just be alone for a while since I was still feeling hurt. She agreed and left me alone. Things seemed ok the following day when she left for work and I went out for a walk in the hills and by the afternoon we seemed mostly back to normal.  \n\n\nAfter I left but before she asked me for the money she even sent me a load of messages about how I didn't have to clean and put stuff away and that I was welcome back anytime. It was only the next day she asked for money.", "Curious about this as well.", "Okay, she probably did do this to make a point but you are definetly NTA.\n\nFunnily, I live in Switzerland, am a social worker and worked the past year with Ukrainian refugees, so I think I have a better understanding than her on how the Swiss treat Ukrainians and how the Ukrainians respond. Pretty much the same as any refugee with the main difference being, they are able to work (Swiss law, not a statement abou refugees) and many do so! So, she is full of shit and has no idea what she is talking about and 120.- is cheap to get rid of her stupidity and hate!\n\nEdit: you might want to edit your edit a bit though, since your wording and context make it seem to be about a woman or queer related topic", "Oh thanks, I'll reword it slightly. I hadn't really considered that it had that implication. Thank you for taking the time to read my long reply!", "NTA, but this person is no longer a friend.\n\nWhether or not you are misogynist is beyond the scope of this post, and I'm not touching it.  She could be right or not.  However, if a friend of mine said something misogynistic, I would say, hey, that isn't right, and here is why I think so.  Forthright but not attacking, because a friend doesn't deserve attacks.  You don't educate people by calling them names, and I would want to educate a friend.  (Actually did, dragged a good male friend into being a feminist and properly encouraging his adult daughters to be strong women.  Two listened, and managed to raise healthy families and deal with difficult husbands with grace.  The third ignored him and let a narcissist second husband put her children by her late first husband through hell.   \n Sorry, tangent.)\n\nCorollary to the previous paragraph is that a woman who declares that you are misogynist and won't discuss the issue graciously, who charges you rent for nights spent at her place, is NOT your friend.  Friendship is over.  Done.  I'm sorry for your loss, it hurts to lose a friend, but she is no longer in a headspace where friendship works for her.  \n\nIt may help to understand that women who have been crapped on frequently by ignorant men, can become very sensitive to male comments that have a background assumption that women are less-than, although the men making those comments aren't aware of the background.  It is similar to those of us who have been raised in a culture dominated by one race, being insensitive to subtle comments (microaggressions) made by us about people of other races.  Insensitivity is greatly improved by being generally aware and respectful.  This is not a comment aimed at OP as much as a general one; I try to train myself to learn to be more sensitive, and I recommend that approach for all of us.  We are all, regardless of race, origin culture, gender, sex, orientation, and ability, insensitive in some areas.  That's how our brain works.  We're human.  The benefit to being human is that we can learn until we die.", "NTA.", "\"she is no longer in a headspace where friendship works for her\"  \n\n\nSo I really felt this line in particular here. It neatly sums up a lot of the feeling I got from her this past week.", "Move on.  There will be people to willingly take her place if you are kind, generous, and gracious.  I've had many friendships in my long-ish life, and they mostly had natural ends; we'd bonded over something important to us then, and our outlooks and interests changed.  This sounds like a natural end for her, although I can't imagine treating someone that way, but I'm not her and don't know her experiences.  Maybe there was trauma that she doesn't want to talk about.  OP, another person's experiences don't necessarily reflect on you in any way.", "I think the irony / sad part for me at least. Is I was the first and for a while the only person she did tell about her trauma. I won't share the details but I knew before her family about her experiences, and even leading up to this trip it felt like we still had that bond. But it just seemed to evaporate after we saw each other in person again. Oh well, it's not the first friendship i've had end, im just sad it ended like this.", "Regarding the argument I just gave a full break down in another reply to my comment I hope that helps with context.\n\nYes you're right I should probably try and talk to her about this, I really just wanted to be sure I wasnt being a complete AH for thinking it was a bit weird and unfair to ask after the trip.", "Pretty much this, yea."]}
