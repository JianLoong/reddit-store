I'm 47, my older sister (52) is separated with 2 adult children, boy 24 and girl 21, and both live with her. \n\nShe announced that she had been evicted from her house for non payment of her mortgage. This was a shock to me, my mother, and other siblings. She is unable to tell us how much her mortgage is or when she last paid it. We are angry at her for letting it go so far to the point that she's been evicted and is now struggling to find accommodation. \n\nI'm angry as she allowed this to happen and now expect everyone to pick up the pieces for her and help her. It reminds me of when she was invited to a birthday party at a restaurant, and we all agreed to split the bill. She, my niece and nephew, ordered starters, mains, desserts, and drinks. It was only afterwards she announced she'd no money to pay for hers and kid's split of the bill. She seems to wait until our backs are against the wall. Then, she knows we've no choice but to bail her out. She's always been terrible with money.\n\nI've a good paying job and have helped her in the past. She knows I've a huge amount saved in my account as I'm looking to buy a house but I'm still saving as I can't afford one yet. I live in my car most days of the week when I'm working.\n\nI loaned her from my savings to pay to have her gas boiler replaced. I set up a repayment account, and she's been slowly paying me back. I found out she had won \u20ac5000 soon after I came her my loan, and she told people she had no intentions of paying me back, this made me angry, so I asked her to pay me back so I can put the money back into my savings. She said she was paying me back and so far has repaid 1/4 of the loan. \n\nWhat's really making me angry is that there are institutions to help people struggling with debt. They help consolidate debt and negotiate with lenders to reach repayment amounts that are more manageable for the person. \n\nMany years ago, I ran into difficulty paying my mortgage. I rang my lender, and we came to an agreement to help me . When I was back on my feet, I started paying the mortgage again. Why didn't she do this?\n\nPart of me thinks she did it out of spite because she expected her ex-husband to pay. \n\nMy sister was crying down the phone to my mam, looking for money for a hotel. My mam wanted to give her \u20ac1000 but it would be better off booking the hotel instead. At least then we know where our money went. In the end, my mum gave her \u20ac200. I said I'd give her \u20ac200 too. Then we found out our niece and nephew went to their dad's mother and sister and knew nothing about the hotel. \n\nI don't believe I should help her because it's her fault for getting herself into this situation. When she shows she's making an effort to help herself, then I will help her, but not until she makes an effort. I believe she's just sitting around waiting for people to dig her out of this hole. My mam is worried sick and feeling guilty.", "created_utc": 1677501983, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11db0ve/aita_for_not_giving_money_to_my_sister/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do not need to help her out any further. You may feel guilty letting your sister suffer with the consequences of her actions, but it really has nothing to do with you.

The end.", "NTA. I ended up cutting a close family member out of my life for treating me like a piggy bank. It wears you down and will make you resent her more in the long run if you continue. It sounds like she needs some serious financial education and perhaps refusing to bail her out this time will kick her into action. Even if she has to declare bankruptcy it\u2019s not the end of the world (at least in my country) Besides, you\u2019re trying to save for a home and sleeping in your car most nights it\u2019s crazy to me that she\u2019s expecting you to give your savings.

I'm not the greatest with money either but I don't make that everyone else's problem. Time for your adult sister to come to terms with her situation. Her expectations of her ex-husband obviously aren't being met, and haven't been for quite some time. I'm also kind of understanding why she might be his ex-wife at this point. It's nice of you to help your sister at all but you are not obligated to fix this situation for her. Time for sis to step up and handle her business.", "She really doesn\u2019t seem to deserve much in the way of sympathy.", "NTA.\n\nShe *still* owes you quite a chunk of money. Don't throw more down the drain. This is how my husband and I handle our kids occasional requests; if there's already a loan, no further money will be available. Otherwise you're asking to be the Eternal ATM.\n\nLet her handle the mess she made.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nShe had demonstrated that she's untrustworthy. You know from her history that she'll disregard any idea if a loan, and she'll take your money as a handout. From there, she'll continue to make poor decisions and then work your emotions to take more of your earnings from you. She will financially sink you if you let her.\n\nYou commented that there are agencies that can help her, and that's what she needs. It will help her through the immediate emergency and will help set her up with plans and rules that will enable her to help herself. Forcing her in that direction really is giving her the best chance. It's also giving yourself the best chance of reaching your financial goals, which you deserve!\n\nIt hurts to tell a loved one \"no\" (btdt), but it really is important to do now, for both of you.", "NTA.  If you continue to help her, she will continue to expect it and make you feel guilty for not helping.  It\u2019s a vicious cycle and the only way out is to break it off.  Don\u2019t support her financially, especially if she has a history of lying and manipulating you.  She\u2019s not coming to you legitimately asking for help.  She\u2019s expecting you and other family to bail her out of a mess she made.  If she really needed help with her mortgage, she could have asked for $ long before it came to this point.  It may be hard, but you will most likely have to go no contact with her if you don\u2019t give her what she wants.  She may blame you and claim some BS about you ruining her life or something like that.  I had a similar experience with a family member and went NC when I realized all it was getting me was a volcanic explosion of toxic and hateful behavior.", "So she already owes you for a gas boiler loan and you really need our opinion on if you should give this thieving leech more?? Seriously?? If you can\u2019t figure that one out for yourself you might as well just keep giving her money as no one in this story seems to ever learn anything. NTA", "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  NTA.  Honey, you have a good job and are still sleeping in your car.  You are in no position to help her.  Help your parents stiffen their backbones too because she will drain them dry.\n\nShe also has two adult children.  Why aren't they contributing to the household?", "NTA. \n\nIf your sister is able to put in the effort and figure out her actual situation, then MAYBE you can consider loaning her money. But right now, she doesn't know how much her mortgage is? how much she has paid? when she last paid it?! She needs to organize at least the basics -- who she owes money to and how much, what's her job situation, what is her plan other than crying for money, etc. If she isn't able to do even that minimum, then it shows that she isn't willing to put in any effort for her financial situation, and any money you lend her will never be seen again. Especially since the kids are already taken care of, your sister is on her own.", "NTA", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to cut them off.", "NTA at this point it\u2019s basically throwing money out the window. She needs to take steps to get her finances under control, and she doesn\u2019t get any more handouts until she can show that she has taken those steps. If she asks for help then tell her to get her bank statements and credit info and you will help her get a plan together, but she isn\u2019t getting another dime. \n\nAnd if you want to help her kids the offer to teach them about budgeting and saying no to their mom when she comes asking for cash.", "NTA\n\nShe will literally never learn if you all keep bailing her out. \n\nShe has proven her strategy to live includes you and your mam paying her bills. \n\nIt will be hard, especially for your mam, but do not help her.", "NTA I had an uncle like this. He would ask his siblings for money. He would turn up on the doorstep and not leave until he was given money to do so and have his car repaired, like new tyres, lights fixed or whatever it was and filled up with petrol to get home. Then he'd ask money of his wife, ex wife, their families, his kids, his kid's partners and the partner's families. His nieces and nephews and their partners and families. It never ever stopped. If he came into money he would never share it, or pay what he owed. Even when he drew his pension he was still asking for money for his rent, groceries, bills etc. Even though his siblings managed on exactly the same pension. When he died it was discovered he didn't rent. He owned his house outright and it was worth over 300,000 and he had over 50,000 in the bank. Yet until the day he died he still had his brother buying his groceries and paying for his car repairs for him. Moochers never, ever stop mooching. You cannot help someone who lives the way she does. It is a bottomless pit. She could have helped herself but chose not to.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks but she's put herself in a shit situation.\n\nInstead of money for a hotel, or rent, or a deposit on an apartment, people could have contributed to the equity of her home.  The equity of her home that is now lost forever.   I imagine her new financial constraints, and the fact that she doesn't have the gas boiler will preclude her from paying back her outstanding debt.  \n\nIf her kids are squared away, it's time to let her feel the bottom and attempt to bounce back up.", "NTA. You'll most likely never see any further loans being repaid. I would also have way too many questions for her: WHY didn't she pay her mortgage? Does she still have her job? Does she still get paid the same salary? What exactly has all her money been spent on, etc. I'm kinda wondering if she has a drug, shopping or gambling problem, especially since she's being so vague about what exactly happened and when, the amount of money due, etc. Also her children who live with her are adults, do they also have full-time jobs? Why couldn't they pay the mortgage?", "NTA. Sounds like your sister needs help, but not financially", "I agree.  You've done enough.", "I would have stopped helping out long ago. She isn\u2019t \u201cterrible with money\u201d. She\u2019s a mooch and manipulative. She needs to learn how to stand on her own. \n\nNTA", "NTA. This. OP, talk to your mom. Explain that if you give her money, she'll keep wanting money. Tell your mom she can do what she wants, but you won't pay her another penny, and not to ask you, because you're firm with your decision."]}
