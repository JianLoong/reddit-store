I read that you dehydrate twice as fast on a plane as you do elsewhere, so I packed two 40oz water bottles and planned to drink both of them over the course of the flight (should note I\u2019m a pretty big person and an athlete). I booked a middle seat because I\u2019m on a budget and I also don\u2019t particularly care about the aisle/window and I used the bathroom four times over the course of the flight. Each time, the person sitting on the aisle got progressively annoyed. She was sleeping and I woke her up each time. She would sigh, groan, roll her eyes, etc whenever I got up. When I used the bathroom for the third time, she asked me if I could try to hold it for the remainder of the flight so she could sleep. (I should mention it was 4pm and there was no time change involved.) I didn\u2019t take her request too seriously and continued to drink water. When I got up for the fourth time, she told me I was rude for not following her request. I told her it was either that, dehydrate, or wet myself and going to the bathroom seemed like the best option. She told me no one needs to drink enough to pee four times in less than three hours unless they have a bladder issue. She then asked me if I had a bladder issue and I said no, not that that\u2019s your business. I asked if she wanted to switch seats so I didn't have to climb over her, but she refused. She kept pressing me and I suggested that we flag down a flight attendant because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable resolving this on my own. The flight attendant sided with me, but at home my family had some disagreements. Some said I did nothing wrong, and that I have the right to drink water and I\u2019m not breaking rules, but others said it was discourteous to drink that much water during s flight and that I should be able to hold it, especially if the person on the aisle is sleeping.

It\u2019s not like you had to pee three times per hour, it was only a little more than once every hour.

The flight was three hours long. I read that you dehydrate twice as fast on a plane as you do elsewhere, so I packed two 40oz water bottles and planned to drink both of them over the course of the flight (should note I\u2019m a pretty big person and an athlete). I booked a middle seat because I\u2019m on a budget and I also don\u2019t particularly care about the aisle/window and I used the bathroom four times over the course of the flight. Each time, the person sitting on the aisle got progressively annoyed. She was sleeping and I woke her up each time. She would sigh, groan, roll her eyes, etc whenever I got up. When I used the bathroom for the third time, she asked me if I could try to hold it for the remainder of the flight so she could sleep. (I should mention it was 4pm and there was no time change involved.) I didn\u2019t take her request too seriously and continued to drink water. When I got up for the fourth time, she told me I was rude for not following her request. I told her it was either that, dehydrate, or wet myself and going to the bathroom seemed like the best option. She told me no one needs to drink enough to pee four times in less than three hours unless they have a bladder issue. She then asked me if I had a bladder issue and I said no, not that that\u2019s your business. I asked if she wanted to switch seats so I didn't have to climb over her, but she refused.

Personally, I find 4 times in three hours excessive as well and it could have been reduced by not drinking as much, but when you need the bathroom, you need the bathroom.\n\nOP, take this as a learning experience, and choose an aisle seat next time. Gives you more leg room as well.", "Sad to see people here have so little empathy you got voted down, for your sensible comment. After all, you did say you choose the aisle seat.", "Yeah, this. NTA.  You offered a solution, she refused it, that's on her at that point.", "you don't gotta go 4 times in 3 hours and if you do you should seek medical attention.", "If I paid for an aisle seat there is no way I would swap for a middle seat because some idiot wanted to over hydrate and piss every 40 minutes. I\u2019d be pissed too.", "Exactly !", "Bets on them being a gym bro?", "Most TSA will allow empty vessels through screening and most airports have water filling stations after security for idjits like this.", "Uh you just bring empty water bottles through security and fill them at a fountain near the gate. Not that crazy.", "He drank 80oz actually, not 40", "And there is a thing as over hydrating and flushing out all your electrolytes..", "This made me laugh out loud -- OP would have to carry like 49204824 gallons to not die in Death Valley by OP's logic.", "I drink a ridiculous amount of liquid per day, because I have some problems with my throat, and drinking as much as I do is kinda necessary to keep breathing decently. I also have MS, which means the urge to go to the bathroom can hit fast. Despite these factors, this would have been excessive even for me! I'd make sure I have an aisle seat though.", "I'm genuinely concerned about the amount of water OP consumed. I was on a 16hr flight and I drank maybe 5 cups max mostly because I was terrified of possibly inconveniencing the people in middle and aisle seats.", "I am LOLing! I am also someone who drinks a ton of water all day long so this might have been me on this flight.", "That's 4 pints or roughly 2.3 litres", "Same. I can hold it for hours irl, but on a flight, impossible. Knowing this, I pay for an aisle seat because I\u2019m not an absolute asshole. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if OP had something unexpected happen (like a uti or something), but to actively keep drinking an unnecessary amount and to knowingly inconvenience others\u2026? Totally sucks.", "Same! I call it airplane-bladder. The second the seatbelt sign goes on, I have to pee. So I always book an aisle so I don't annoy my seat mates.", "I book aisle too. I hate trying to get out otherwise", "Same, along with a health condition that also van make me need to pee a lot. My top number of times was also 4 bathroom trips to pee on a 4 hour flight. I was up front on the aisle, so I disturbed no one. The nearby flight attendant noticed, though, and made a joke about my having had enough water to drink. I think he forgot I was one of the passengers who received disability assistance, because he immediately felt bad when I explained it was due to my health condition and I was trying to keep hydrated.", "Getting up 1.33 times an hour is way beyond the expected \u2018excuse me I need to get by\u2019 standard", "If you plan on drinking an unreasonable amount of water on a 3 hour flight, you should use common sense and book the aisle seat to not inconvenience others with your unreasonable decisions.", "Don\u2019t know why this is getting down voted.

I don't know, I don't usually look at the time. But yeah, sometimes I do go a long time without going to the toilet. I might feel that I need to pee, but I'm dealing with some extreme fatigue right now so I have trouble getting out of bed and nope, I just don't go.", "Yeah they\u2019re modern and everything and I know they get cleaned regularly but I just worry about the hygiene. I\u2019m mostly trying to avoid having to go on the airplane though since they\u2019re just so ridiculously tiny and climbing over your aisle mates is awkward", "Ya but their 3 hour tour ended up lasting a few years...", "Yeah, for some, possibly, maybe, probably not, and if it did have a little of water.

Should he have just sat there and wet himself?", "I think their point was that OP said that you dehydrated twice as quickly on a flight, so by that logic he was trying to drink twice the usual intake", "They said 40 because OP stated that \"you dehydrate twice as fast on the plane.\"", "As a flight attendant, it is recommended that you drink a cup (or half bottle) of water per hour of your flight.", "I just looked it up because that's such an excessive amount of water - according to the ever-reliable Wikipedia, water intoxication can occur when water intake grossly exceeds output, and healthy kidneys can process .8-1 liter of water per hour. 80oz over 3 hours is just about .8 liter per hour, so let's hope OP's kidneys are healthy...", "LOL I purposely dehydrate myself before a flight because like you, I am overly worried about inconveniencing others in my row, and because I despise using airplane bathrooms.", "I have a nervous bladder. I get nervous about having to get up on planes and use the bathroom so I pee like fourteen times before I board and then pray.", "Yes! Happens in the car, too. As soon as I hit the highway, I\u2019m looking for places to pull over. Weird phenomenon.", "Meh I'm the same, I go in the morning and there are some days I don't again until late evening.", "She wasn't being inconsiderate, she had to use the bathroom, one of the most basic in the hierarchy of needs. If the other person wanted to sleep, they could have switched seats.", "He shouldn't have drank over half a gallon of water on a flight where all he's doing is sitting on his ass.", "So 32oz of water for a 4 hour flight, not 80oz? Do you want me to DIE?", "My mom told me this to scare me about taking ecstasy when I was little. She said that a teenage girl had taken some X and got so thirsty that she drank herself to death with water.", "Just don't dehydrate by getting REALLY drunk the night before. Only time I've ever had motion sickness was when I was hungover on a plane.", "Please don\u2019t do this either. My friend ended up in the ER the morning after a flight because he was so dehydrated that he woke up in the morning with short term amnesia. Almost thought he was on drugs in the morning because he couldn\u2019t walk straight and kept repeating questions.\n\nGranted he also worked out and laid out in the Vegas sun right after his flight too.", "Omg! I\u2019m the same way. I don\u2019t drink anything at least an hour before my flight and then pee a billion times before getting on. And then pray as well lol.", "I can literally be at the grocery store, feel that oh yikes I need to go, and then when I get home I sit down and like five hours later I realize oh, yeah, I needed the toilet. xD", "They were inconsiderate AHS if you're going to knowingly chug 80oz of gatorade plus water you know you're gonna p!ss like a race horse pay for the d@mn aisle seat don't try to scam a free upgrade for being annoying.", "You\u2019re welcome to drink more in an aisle seat of course \ud83d\ude02", "24oz- a \u201ccup\u201d is 8oz\u2026.they want you to turn into sponge Bob when he visited sandy the first time \ud83e\udd23", "That was a very real phenomenon in the 90'ies.", "This actually does happen.
