I read that you dehydrate twice as fast on a plane as you do elsewhere, so I packed two 40oz water bottles and planned to drink both of them over the course of the flight (should note I\u2019m a pretty big person and an athlete). I booked a middle seat because I\u2019m on a budget and I also don\u2019t particularly care about the aisle/window and I used the bathroom four times over the course of the flight. Each time, the person sitting on the aisle got progressively annoyed. She was sleeping and I woke her up each time. She would sigh, groan, roll her eyes, etc whenever I got up. When I used the bathroom for the third time, she asked me if I could try to hold it for the remainder of the flight so she could sleep. (I should mention it was 4pm and there was no time change involved.) I didn\u2019t take her request too seriously and continued to drink water. When I got up for the fourth time, she told me I was rude for not following her request. I told her it was either that, dehydrate, or wet myself and going to the bathroom seemed like the best option. She told me no one needs to drink enough to pee four times in less than three hours unless they have a bladder issue. She then asked me if I had a bladder issue and I said no, not that that\u2019s your business. I asked if she wanted to switch seats so I didn't have to climb over her, but she refused. She kept pressing me and I suggested that we flag down a flight attendant because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable resolving this on my own. The flight attendant sided with me, but at home my family had some disagreements. Some said I did nothing wrong, and that I have the right to drink water and I\u2019m not breaking rules, but others said it was discourteous to drink that much water during s flight and that I should be able to hold it, especially if the person on the aisle is sleeping.

Someone who hydrates a *lot* (my wife and I both drink lots of water and joke about being frequent pee twins) might need 2, depending on the timing. Anything more than that is ridiculous.\n\nFor a healthy male I think it's something like 3.5L of water intake per day; for active people who that goes up to 5-6 or so. Maybe more if you're like an NFL player during intense training in the summer heat. So basically you're drinking like 2/3 your daily water requirement in the space of 3 hours. Do you normally drink 3 gallons of water a day and pee 20 times? Probably not (if so, that's weird).\n\nNext time you're on a flight, think about normal water intake / pee breaks over the course of the day, and then prorate that for the length of your flight. On a 3 hour flight, even 40oz water is more than sufficient and 2 breaks would be kind of a lot. There's a certain degree of prep that makes flying a lot better -- one thing is not getting too dehydrated, but another is monitoring your water intake so you don't constantly have to pee and disrupt other passengers / monopolize the lavatory. Also, make use of the airport toilets before / after your flight. That's 2 free pee breaks you can get that are essentially within your flight time window, but without having to utilize the onboard lavatories.", "How did they get 80 oz on the plane.

You including that like it means anything is just another AH move on your part. \"This person who is legally obligated to allow me to get out of my seat agreed I should be able to get out of my seat\"\n\nObviously, you have every right to drink ridiculous amounts of water and take as many bathroom breaks as needed.

You'd just be an AH for doing so", "It's your right to drink water if you want. But in my personal opinion YTA, because you purposely did something that you should have known would be inconvenient to other people.  And then after you were told it's annoying you just ignored the warning. It's not that long of a  flight. You should be able to go a few hours without drinking, or going to the bathroom, unless of course you really have to, or you have a medical issue, or you're a baby.

If you\u2019re actually sick that\u2019s one thing but it is honestly just rude to plan to do that.", "May have been the third flight of a long journey you never know.", "This, also OP has no idea if the woman just came in from a connecting flight that involved time zone changes, may have had a long layover or had to clear customs, had to drive hours to get to the airport,  was up all night nervous about the upcoming flight, or is just generally exhausted because air travel is just plain exhausting. Just because OP wasn't tired doesn't mean the woman wasn't", ">pay for the aisle seat or get ready to have another pissed off seat mate\n\nAs someone with a small bladder who can hold it for no more than 1.5 hours (absolute maximum!!), I ALWAYS get an aisle seat. I would never subject someone to me crawling over them the amount of times I have to get up. So rude.", "Not only is OP an Asshole, but he's also a dumbass. He didn't stop to think that maybe after the 2nd trip to the bathroom in a little over an hour, his body was telling him that he's plenty hydrated and to stop drinking or slow down? On top of that, OP admits he's a big person so all the more inconvenient for the people next to him.", "Absolutely this.\n\n\nYTA\n\nIt's recommended to drink 8 oz water per hour on a flight. And a three hour flight isn't going to dehydrate you anyway. But even if you double the recommended amount,that would be 48 oz not 80 oz\n\nI tend to drink water and coffee and pee often so I always pay extra for an aisle seat\n\nI'm very curious how OP packed 2 40oz bottles of water and got them through airport security? Unless he bought them at the airport? But mostly they sell the half liter bottles. Or maybe filled them from a faucet after security? Hmmm", "I wonder what his plan was if the flight experienced significant turbulence throughout, just carry on drinking water and pee himself?", "That's almost 5 beers! Insane!", "OP seems to be someone who takes things to the extreme. They should read about water toxicity and hyponatremia. Bet they\u2019ll go the opposite extreme next flight.", "I may have an overactive bladder and insisted that I have an aisle seat when flying with my dad on a 17 hour flight. It\u2019s pretty freeing being able to go whenever without disturbing anyone.", "He offered as she already needed to move the 4th time. Totally meaniningless offer", "The offer was made as she needed to stand up for the 7th time of the fight. The offer was pretty meaningless at that point.", "This is fiction. Aside from what you said, OP said he packed 2 giant bottles of water. Assuming they\u2019re in the USA, TSA would have forced them to chuck it. This was written by someone who doesn\u2019t fly a lot and doesn\u2019t really know how these things work.", "Rice pudding in the nasal cavity isn\u2019t comfortable, so, um, thanks. Now I have to go guzzle 160 ounces of water to flush it out", "One of the clients at the residential agency I work for has a huge issue with that. We have to carefully monitor how much water he drinks cause he will make himself sick just chugging water all day.", "I\u2019m not defending OP, he\u2019s definitely YTA. \n\nIf I had to guess what he meant on middle seat, is he didn\u2019t pay in advance to select his seat. So he ended up getting assigned a middle seat when he checked in, as that was what was left available.", "3liters, cause he took 2. He drank 1l an hour. That's a deatg rate", "I needed to change this to metric because it looked absurd and didn't realise it would look worse. That's 186,260,520 million litres lol", "I did more than this multiple times because of extreme thirst and my doctor\u2019s didn\u2019t give af. Blood sugar was normal but ketones in my urine", "What\u2019s psychogenic thirst? I\u2019ve been thirstier than this multiple times. Blood glucose normal", "Da fuck. OP is crazy. No one needs that much water an hour. What an AH.", "I would be so delighted if someone got on my flight and sat next to me with a cat. Best flight ever! Unfortunately in Europe that's unlikely to happen \ud83d\ude22", "I\u2019m picturing this now, thanks for the chuckle. Big huge athletic lunatic weatherboarding himself in the middle seat with a poor passenger trying to sleep next to him.", "MANIFEST DESTINY THE MUSICAL REFERENCE ????", "Yeah, I rarely sleep on flights and have done many 14+ hour flights. So I get the aisle seat cos I know I'll be getting up to use the bathroom whilst most of the plane is sleeping.\n\nExcept for one flight. Booked the aisle as usual but due to circumstances didn't get any sleep the night before my flight. Ended up passing out for about 6 hours and woke up to my seat mate jumping over me (didn't touch me at all). I apologised so much and said she could have woken me but she said I seemed like I needed that sleep and didn't want to wake me.\n\nI think the most times I have ever needed to let a single person out was about 4. And that was a 15 hour flight.\n\nOP was ridiculous for a 3 hour flight and no UTI.", "I've knocked back that much when dealing with heat stress (digging trenchs the old fashioned way, 42\u00b0 heat, 30 mins in the sun digging alternating with 30 minutes inside in the cool). \n\nBut that's a pretty extreme circumstance.\n\nI'm sorry your doc wasn't doing their job. Are you ok now?", "Do not do this. If you present at hospital with kidney pain one of the first questions is \u201chave you been on a flight?\u201d\n\nJust top up from a bottle. There\u2019s a sweet spot where you won\u2019t need to pee.", "It's basically compulsive water drinking, usually associated with psych disorders. If this guy sincerely believes he will get dehydrated if he's not drinking this much, I wonder if he has anxiety around the issue or psychosomatic thirst.", "Oh yes, I'd love that to happen too!", "Why? Had that happen to me in Europe.", "What the heck? That\u2019s horrible. Why did she do it?", "THEY HAVE IT FOR SWITCH?", "My daughter has a Switch. I loved Oregon Trail. I\u2019m going to see if we can get it. \ud83d\ude01", "I honestly can't fathom being on the aisle and being surprised or annoyed someone wanted out?\n\nLike I know OP's pee need was self inflicted but there's so so so many reasons someone might need out that I would *never* expect an undisturbed flight in an aisle seat.\n\nI'd say if the lady wanted to sleep she should have paid for a window tbh", "Sounds like heat stroke", "I\u2019m so happy to read this. My people! I just want to say\u2026oh hold on a minute\u2026*runs to pee*", "Really?! I've never seen an animal in the cabin flying from the UK. I assumed it wasn't allowed. There is hope! My cat flight will come \ud83d\ude01", "Her mind was that of a younger child to begin with from being abused as a baby.", "And that river ran through sleeping campers.", "They also have it on Apple Arcade (with the same \u201cwe\u2019ve changed stuff to do better\u201d rider\u201d", "Good luck. I love cats, too. This one was well behaved but kept meowing for the whole flight. The plane is already very loud so I couldn't really here him very clearly but see his mouth open and close all the time.", "Awww, man. That sucks even more since she didn\u2019t know why she shouldn\u2019t do it. I was hoping it was a contest or something like a marathon that she just went overboard. I\u2019m very sorry.", "Now I really want a switch", "I was actually kidding because you know people on drugs are generally not super careful because their high."]}
