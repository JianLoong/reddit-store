I read that you dehydrate twice as fast on a plane as you do elsewhere, so I packed two 40oz water bottles and planned to drink both of them over the course of the flight (should note I\u2019m a pretty big person and an athlete). I booked a middle seat because I\u2019m on a budget and I also don\u2019t particularly care about the aisle/window and I used the bathroom four times over the course of the flight. Each time, the person sitting on the aisle got progressively annoyed. She was sleeping and I woke her up each time. She would sigh, groan, roll her eyes, etc whenever I got up. When I used the bathroom for the third time, she asked me if I could try to hold it for the remainder of the flight so she could sleep. (I should mention it was 4pm and there was no time change involved.) I didn\u2019t take her request too seriously and continued to drink water. When I got up for the fourth time, she told me I was rude for not following her request. I told her it was either that, dehydrate, or wet myself and going to the bathroom seemed like the best option. She told me no one needs to drink enough to pee four times in less than three hours unless they have a bladder issue. She then asked me if I had a bladder issue and I said no, not that that\u2019s your business. I asked if she wanted to switch seats so I didn't have to climb over her, but she refused. She kept pressing me and I suggested that we flag down a flight attendant because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable resolving this on my own. The flight attendant sided with me, but at home my family had some disagreements. Some said I did nothing wrong, and that I have the right to drink water and I\u2019m not breaking rules, but others said it was discourteous to drink that much water during s flight and that I should be able to hold it, especially if the person on the aisle is sleeping.

Someone who hydrates a *lot* (my wife and I both drink lots of water and joke about being frequent pee twins) might need 2, depending on the timing. Anything more than that is ridiculous.\n\nFor a healthy male I think it's something like 3.5L of water intake per day; for active people who that goes up to 5-6 or so. Maybe more if you're like an NFL player during intense training in the summer heat. So basically you're drinking like 2/3 your daily water requirement in the space of 3 hours. Do you normally drink 3 gallons of water a day and pee 20 times? Probably not (if so, that's weird).\n\nNext time you're on a flight, think about normal water intake / pee breaks over the course of the day, and then prorate that for the length of your flight. On a 3 hour flight, even 40oz water is more than sufficient and 2 breaks would be kind of a lot. There's a certain degree of prep that makes flying a lot better -- one thing is not getting too dehydrated, but another is monitoring your water intake so you don't constantly have to pee and disrupt other passengers / monopolize the lavatory. Also, make use of the airport toilets before / after your flight. That's 2 free pee breaks you can get that are essentially within your flight time window, but without having to utilize the onboard lavatories.", "How did they get 80 oz on the plane.

You including that like it means anything is just another AH move on your part. \"This person who is legally obligated to allow me to get out of my seat agreed I should be able to get out of my seat\"\n\nObviously, you have every right to drink ridiculous amounts of water and take as many bathroom breaks as needed.

You'd just be an AH for doing so", "It's your right to drink water if you want. But in my personal opinion YTA, because you purposely did something that you should have known would be inconvenient to other people.  And then after you were told it's annoying you just ignored the warning. It's not that long of a  flight. You should be able to go a few hours without drinking, or going to the bathroom, unless of course you really have to, or you have a medical issue, or you're a baby.
