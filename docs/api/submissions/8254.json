I asked her why I always see her carrying Lily and asked if she can't walk.

If you care about Lily, which it doesn't sound like you do, you'd ask how she was doing. Instead, you questioned why SIL was carrying her. \n\nTip: when you're dismissive or judgemental, people can usually tell. Regardless of what you asked, it sounded like an attack because it was one.", "YTA. \n\n1. You shouldn't have asked in front of Lily.\n2. You seem to be asking not out of compassion or even curiosity but out of some weird kind of judgmentalism.\n3. Many foster kids have developmental delays, emotional and psychological conditions due to trauma, and physical limitations due to the injuries from physical abuse and neglect. \n4. The facts surrounding child welfare cases are confidential.\n5. Since you're clearly clueless, here's the proper way to discreetly inquire, when Lily is not present: \"Hey, I think what you're doing with Lily is amazing. I know the facts of such cases are confidential, but is there anything I should know about her physical or emotional conditions or needs so I can make her comfortable when I'm around her, avoid triggering any past abuse, and get her appropriate gifts?", "YTA, she's in foster care for a reason, neglect is probably part of the reason. She's chronologically six, and developmentally, she's younger. Your sister is meeting her where she is and showing her the affection she has apparently not received. Why do you care how she parents? If you really want to know Google is free, read about trauma and how it affects children.", "YTA. Seems like an incredibly rude thing to ask, especially if the child is present, which she was.", "YTA\n\nyou know she acts younger and is smaller than others, so maybe she's mentally younger than everyone else, and has issues or possibly was abused in her previous home. \n\nno matter what it is you are old enough not to ask why, I get you're curious, but with fosters you never ask questions. \n\nshe could have something mentally or physically different than everyone else it's not unheard of. \n \nmy brother was in pull ups until he was 14, and sucked his thumb until he was 8. he is mentally younger than the rest of us, you just learn to accept it.", "Maybe there is a reason she carries her that you aren't privy to. I mean, you said there might be something with her, which tells me you don't know the whole story. Who cares if she's always carrying Lilly? That's between her, your brother, and Lilly. So yes, YTA. And clearly, your SIL did the right thing by telling your parents because she knew she probably would say something that was nastier than your comment.", "I'd go with YTA on it as it really wasn't your business to ask and something could be physically wrong with the child that is a touchy subject", "YTA why a parent is holding their child isn\u2019t your business. Foster children go thru a lot and this is actually heartwarming your SIL keeps her close - it\u2019s probably providing that little a great deal of comfort in what has been an awful situation.", "YTA Curiosity isn\u2019t an excuse to pry into a child\u2019s medical history. It isn\u2019t acceptable to ask people or their caregivers why they are delayed/disabled. Did you really expect your SIL to go into the child\u2019s medical history with you on the street at a farmer\u2019s market, disclosing information that is private and protected? SIL shut you down and protected her child, as she should have. Curious as to your age, which might change my feelings on her telling your parents about it, but as of right now I\u2019m on board with that as well. You need to learn to function in a society where disabled people exist and understand that you are not entitled to anyone\u2019s medical history, especially because you just want to know because you\u2019re nosy.", "YTA. You said she\u2019s 6, but she looks 4, she\u2019s tiny, is in pull-ups, and sucks her thumb. These are all things she should have grown out of- *had she had a normal upbringing.* To me, and I\u2019m no expert, it sounds like she came from an abusive and neglectful household. There\u2019s a REASON she\u2019s in foster care.\n\nChildren from neglectful households have different needs than you, who I presume grew up in a loving household where you were provided with FOOD and CARE. Her growth, mental and physical, is stunted, according to your description. That\u2019s not something she can control. Have you ever considered the reasons WHY she\u2019s being fostered in the first place?\n\nLily being carried *is none of your business.* in fact, if she *did* come from an abusive or neglectful situation, carrying her and comforting her is a *good thing.* She\u2019s traumatized and going through a big change, she needs the comfort. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being curious, but there is something wrong with \u201cwhy can\u2019t she just walk, why do you always have to hold her?\u201d Why can\u2019t you mind your business? YTA.", "There are so many reasons that a child in foster care has different needs. Sometimes the foster parents aren't told - as a foster parent, your sister has doctors and therapists and social workers who do know they history of the child and have a plan in place to best help the child.\n\nIt's none of your business and asking questions like that in front of the child is horrible. Just because she doesn't speak at age level doesn't mean that she can't understand \n\nYTA", "YTA. Look, I get it - I'm a curious person too, and can be socially clumsy at times.\n\nSo chances are I would have asked about it, as well.\n\nBut if you wanted tlo ask, there were ways to do it more appropriately.\n\nFirst of all, not doing it out in public, and not where Lily could hear you. It should have been a private talk between the two of you.\n\nSecondly, be very aware of your tone and take extra care to avoid any chance it could sound accusatory (chances are, your SIL might have heard it as a veiled implication that she's a helicopter parent, even if that was not what you thought at all). \n\nAnd thirdly, if it becomes clear that the question hit a nerve, always apologize.", "YTA - 1. Rude - 2. None of your business!", "YTA, I\u2019d be curious too but it\u2019s overstepping", "INFO. I need to know how OP asked about this. There\u2018s nothing wrong with asking to understand better, but if you asked in a judgmental way it is really very little of your business to judge. Has Lily expressed desire in front of you to be put down? Are the parents holding her back or do you have reason to think the arrangement is not what\u2019s best for lily (not from what you THINK but what she has EXPRESSED)?", "YTA- She\u2019s trying to make sure Lily feels loved and safe. Stay out of their business. You do you.", "YTA Op this is not something you should have even asked about. You are not in charge of her care so why she needs to be held is not for you to know. Some children regardless of there circumstances in life may just feel better being held or near a parental figure. As you described Lily it is clear she may have a medical condition or something else going on. At the end of the day you do not just ask people things like this. To ask about this is awful but to do so in public is deplorable. You made an awful bed for asking something like this in public so just accept the consequences of being wrong and out of line. Apologize as soon as you can and actually mean it.", "It's called reparenting.  It's about going back to earlier childhood hood stages and getting what you needed . Or attachment parenting.", "YTA. It seems from your description that you know Lily is delayed compared to other kids her age. And you still sounding like you are judging\u2026.", "I'm leaning YTA, though I understand your curiosity.\n\nIt could be a physical disability, or it could be that she has trauma or another mental/emotional issue and feels safer being carried. Remember that foster kids are more likely to have experienced trauma or abuse, or to have other special needs.\n\nIf your SIL and brother didn't feel comfortable sharing the background/reason unprompted, then it's probably rude to ask, though this may depend on what your relationship with them is like overall. Complaining to your parents about it is weird, but makes me think there *is* some private issue there she doesn't feel comfortable sharing and resents being put on the spot like that.", "YTA. I kind of feel like your tone or the way you asked could be the problem kids from bad situation can not only behave as if they are much younger but can physically look much younger as well. Context clues suggest Lily was not in a good living situation at some point.\n\nWhy you want to ask that question in public with Lily present is beyond me.", "YTA. First of all who cares? You\u2019re not being asked to carry the child, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s your problem.\n\nSecond of all, children who are put through foster care often come from extremely neglectful or traumatized backgrounds. The foster care system is inhumane, you don\u2019t know her backstory, you\u2019re not entitled to know, and to deprive a child who may not have received love, care, and physical affection from receiving it another moment would be cruel. \n\nPrying and taking meticulous notice of the ways in which this child may be developmentally delayed when you KNOW she\u2019s a foster kid and could have come from a home life in which she was not cared for makes you ignorant or a giant fucking AH. I\u2019m gonna go with both here.\n\nETA; you and others outside of your SIL\u2019d family are strangers. Of course she may be experiencing some attachment anxiety and being held is probably what makes her feel safe.", "INFO: It's unusual and it is interesting. I'd probably ask about it in my family. But do you and SIL have the kind of relationship where you talk about parenting choices? I think that's key to whether this was nosy or normal.", "YTA  you have no idea of her medical history and have no right to know    mind your own business and worry about yourself", "Yta, mind your business", "YTA you were being nosy & low-key critical. She\u2019s your sister & she knows how you are. Aside from everything else, asking in front of Lily was just rude.", "YTA. First of all, it\u2019s not your business. Second, you said this in front of Lily? She\u2019s not deaf. Third, being a foster child, she\u2019s been through trauma. She needs all the snuggles and closeness she can get. Lily being carried, in pull ups, etc. is not your business. Foster children will usually have extra needs. I personally wouldn\u2019t allow you around her anymore. You sound very ignorant.", "YTA \n\nHow people parent their children is not anyone\u2019s business unless abuse or neglect is involved. It sounds like from your question that this may have been curiosity (does she have mobility issues) than mom shaming, but you have to realize she has probably endured a lot of mom shaming from other mom\u2019s if she is carrying a child on her back (who looks old enough to walk). So she probably assumed that is where you were going with this question. Which brings us to the idea that it is best that all personal questions be kept to yourself unless you are close enough to a person to ask them AND it is the correct time and place to ask them.  You don\u2019t say how old you are so it is difficult to know if age and maturity are at play here but take this as a life lesson to mind your own business next time", "YTA. You have no idea what trauma and neglect Llily has been through. If being carried brings her comfort and security,so be it.", "YTA - why does it matter?", ">and that Lily being carried is none of my business.\n\nyep. YTA", "YTA for rudely asking in front of the child. Also for thinking you are entitled to someone else's medical info and trauma history. Also, because you seem to be jealous that she's carrying a kid around which is just weird", "NAH. I get the curiosity. I also understand that not everyone picks up context clues on special needs kids. And I get why your sister snapped, too. \n\nI have a 6 year old kid with autism who is teeny tiny. My other kid was around the same size at that age but because my son is non verbal, I get stupid questions like that all the time and I just wish people would\u2026 not.", "You see developmental delays in a foster child and your first instinct is to assume the foster mom is overbearing and being too attached. YTA. You've not invested enough time to get to know Lily or your SIL. She also has 4 other kids, so she knows a thing or two about raising a kid. \n\nKeep your nose closer to yourself the next time.", "YTA - your SIL is right. This was rude and uncalled for. You could and should have worded this differently and most certainly not have addressed it while the child was present.\n\nYou state it yourself, the child looks much younger and smaller than her actual age. Why do you think that is? \nThis child must have suffered severe neglect and seems to have finally found someone who is willing to give her love, attention, and an environment to feel safe in. Hopefully it will allow her to heal and eventually catch up on what was kept from her until now. \n \nI salute your SIL for what she does. There are not nearly enough people like her in this world, and far too many kids who would need them.", "NAH. I van understand how you would be confused, and yes, there is probably some developmental delay, but she is also well within her rights to refuse to discuss Lily's medical info.", "NAH. Foster children often have very traumatic pasts. It sounds like your SIL is being an incredible foster parent by giving Lily what she needs, even if it\u2019s often inconvenient. I think asking about it was fine, depending on how it was done, but it might have been better to do it when Lily wasn\u2019t there, or simply to ask if she had any physical limitations that made it difficult to walk. Her emotional needs or history aren\u2019t appropriate to discuss, though.", "NAH. It's a valid question. That being said she isn't under any obligation to discuss it either if she doesn't want to.", "NAH honestly you were just curious, and she probably got defensive of her baby, like any parent lol tbh I would probably text my brother \"is everything okay with lily? Noticed she's always being held, not running around with the other kiddos, not trying to be rude, just wondering <3\" or something like that", "NAH: it takes a village to raise a child. It literally doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. There\u2019s a lot of dramatic responses in here. \n\nIt is however worth an apology if your tone came off more accusatory than curious.", "NTA. It's a pretty intimate question, but it's your sibling's family. I would think the relationship is intimate enough to warrant asking. And if not, your sister should've just set a boundary and say she didn't want to talk about it instead of crying to your parents after the fact.", "NTA, it was just an obvious thing to ask.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
