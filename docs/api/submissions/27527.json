It's not entirely us going no contact but low contact for sure. The reason for this is how they disrespect me and my wife, but mostly me. The whole disrespect thing started when we were expecting our child together. My wife's parents made a comment that they hoped we would be kinder to our child than my parents were to me when they named me. I have seen my name come up on this sub a few times and I know it's controversial (Sky) especially for guys and for a full name. In response to her parents comment, my wife told them they should learn to keep their unrequested opinions to themselves and that they should be less disrespectful of my parents and us.\n\nHer parents looked unhappy when my wife shut them down. But it was not the last comment they made. And then I remembered back when I first met them, and my wife introduced us, and they called me Skyler instead of Sky, and made a face when I corrected them and said my name was just Sky.\n\nThe comments throughout my wife's pregnancy reached a point where we decided low contact was the way to go. The ideal being only some contact with my wife.\n\nIt has been a few months like this and then my ILs told me there was an emergency and needed my help. I called to ask what the emergency was and it was basically to do some things around the house because my wife's father was struggling with back and leg issues and couldn't do any heavy lifting, etc. They told me I was the only person they knew who could do it and they needed help. I was pissed that they had claimed an \"emergency\" when really it was just them not wanting to pay someone. So I told them I do not help people who disrespect me and hung up the phone.\n\nThey sent texts to my phone and later to my wife's phone saying I was behaving in a childish manner and I should have more respect for my wife's parents and my child's grandparents. I didn't reply but I wonder if I should have said less when I said no to helping them. Or if I should have hung up and ignored them when I realized it was not a true emergency.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695549013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qtq1i/aita_for_telling_my_wifes_parents_i_dont_help/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They disrespected you, period. Unless and until they can realize this, and give you a genuine apology, they don't deserve your help in as you said, non emergencies.

Especially if not asked by you.", "Your in-laws make snide remarks about being nicer naming your kid and purposely call you the wrong the name but somehow *you\u2019re* the one acting childishly when you don\u2019t give in to their non-emergency manipulation?\nWoof, NTA. Also, glad your wife has your back.", "NTA\n\nThey needed to be told.\n\nYou can't show disrespect and then expect help.", "To be honest, I would consider just going no contact. They obviously feel they are 100% in the righg and see nothjng wrong with their behaviour and think you and your wife are out of line. They won\u2019t change and it will get worse and worse. \nThey will just try to use both of you and don\u2019t expect them to actually help with the kids. They might take them once, but they will bombard them with toxicity about you and possibly your wife.\nHonestly I think you both owe it to your children to not let these toxic people ruin their young lives. \nI might be quite harsh, but I firmly believe family is not just simply a given, no matter the circumstance.\nI learned to hate because of my father and we cut contact with his parents for less. (After my parents seperated). I didn\u2019t see my father as my father for a decade and although my relationship with him has changed since then, it will never be the same and he will never just be my dad. \nAlso seen examples with other people in my life. The thing is they think they can do just about everything because they are family and you will never really show them the consequences. So they will just get worse until you do.", "NTA ---- Respect is earned not demanded and to be respected you also need to show respect for others.", "You should keep in mind, that, unless stopped, they will continue to talk bad about you to your kid, and that's very traumatizing for kids. So NTA, and you're absolutely right to go LC. And don't let them be alone with your kid unless they change their attitude towards you, so you could control what they are saying around the kid.\n\nEdit: changed a typo in the verdict.", "Don\u2019t second guess yourself.

Sky is... just a name, whatever. I'd be worried if they named you Alabama. \n\nNTA, these people are absurdly close minded for something so inconsequential.", "ESH", "It depends on how you've handled the \"low contact\". Did you tell them you were pulling back? Or why?\n\nYou have every right to say no. The question is, are you trying to bring about change?\n\nA more gentle way would be, \"I'm not really free the next few days. Besides, I don't really feel that you respect me or like me, and I'm not eager to go out of my way to help you when you're consistently rude to me.\"\n\nNo anger, just matter of fact.", "ESH - I'm sorry they've been disrespectful to you, that's rubbish. I do think you need to maybe consider what hills you want to die in though - try to think maybe less about what feels righteously correct \"they've disrespected me, I have every right to be honest about why I'm saying no\" and what's going to lead to the situation feeling more manageable not only for yourself, but for your wife too.\n\nIf she's going low contact while you have pretty much no contact, it wouldn't surprise me if now she's the one needing to deal with the fallout from this instead of you. I'm not saying don't hold boundaries, but just being more brief, keeping things almost more professional in tone could help. Especially if they're to have a relationship with their grandchild, it's important you find ways of holding boundaries with as little drama as possible.", "ESH. You don't need to explain yourself to people and doing so in this case was specifically to be petty. They wanted your help but didn't truly need it. And their behavior towards you and your wife doesn't put them in the category where you'll consider what they want. If they care, they'll figure out why. Kicking them at this time is honestly just going to fester the relationship more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
