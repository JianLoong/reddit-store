I was pissed that they had claimed an \"emergency\" when really it was just them not wanting to pay someone. So I told them I do not help people who disrespect me and hung up the phone.\n\nThey sent texts to my phone and later to my wife's phone saying I was behaving in a childish manner and I should have more respect for my wife's parents and my child's grandparents.

But, son, do not accept this bet, because as sure as you stand there, you're going to wind up with an ear full of cider.*", "People like my ILs who think my parents showed a lack of care for me in how they named me.
