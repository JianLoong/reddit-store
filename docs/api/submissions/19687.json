I recently asked my stepmom to drive me to the drug store to buy hair dye (I don\u2019t have a license). She said yes and when we got there I picked out some silver hair dye. She got a sour look on her face and tried to convince me to go with any other color, but I said no because I wanted silver. \n\nI asked her why she was so insistent, and she said that silver hair was making fun of old people (she\u2019s in her late 40s and has a fair amount of natural gray hair). She said that if I died my hair silver she would take my phone until I dyed it a different color. I told we her that she couldn\u2019t do that because my mom pays for my phone, not her or my dad. She said that it doesn\u2019t matter because she\u2019s my parent and can discipline me however she wants. I said fine and we left without buying any hair dye. \n\nWell a few days later I went to my mom\u2019s house and she helped me dye my hair silver anyway. She didn\u2019t say anything about it being offensive and even said it looked great. \n\nI got back to my dad\u2019s house the other day with my silver hair, and my stepmom freaked out. She did try to take my phone but my dad stopped her because (surprise surprise) my mom pays for it and she can\u2019t just take it without talking to my mom. She huffed and called me a \u201cdisrespectful spoiled brat\u201d (her exact words) because I \u201cran to (my mom) to avoid the rules\u201d. \n\nMy dad later asked me in private to dye my hair to a different color to keep the peace, and he even said he would pay for the dye if I just let my stepmom think she won. I said no, and threatened to stay with my mom full time if she tried to punish me for my hair. My dad called me stubborn. \n\nThey\u2019re both being cold to me and now I\u2019m wondering if I really am being entitled.

Either that or she\u2019s insecure about her own gray hair, depending on if you present more masculine or feminine and/or your agab.

Your hair isn't her issue and maybe you should think of staying at mom's full time if your dad is going to allow her treat you like that.", "NTA. Your step-mom is crazy. She is obviously sour grapes about getting older and took it out on you in a really weird and abusive (spoiled brat name calling) way. You are being stubborn but in a good way. I would hold my ground. This is about hair dye. How dumb of your parents", "NTA. It\u2019s hair. It\u2019s not permanent. Moreover, you are old enough to decide what colour you want to use in your hair and how you want to wear it. \n\nIf they\u2019re cold, just go back to your Mom\u2019s home.", "NTA. Silver hair is popular now and your stepmom's insecurities about gray hair are not your responsibility.", "NTA, I vote stay with your mom full time. Step mom is on a power trip and your dad is enabling her. This will keep happening until you leave.", "NTA. The good new is you're almost 18 and hopefully will not have to be around your step mom much longer. It seems like your dad is choosing his wife over his child which is so messed up, I am so sorry he's doing that to you.", "NTA.  Your stepmom is on a power trip.", "NTA, and it's a weird reaction. If anything, she ought to be flattered you're \"imitating\" her hair colour, since you presumably wouldn't do it if you didn'y like the way it looks.", "NTA.  You get to decide what you do with your body.  The silver lining (pun intended LOL) with this is that  this way you get to see where each member of your family priorities are at.", "NTA  \n\n\nyour hair not her hair, you decide, nobody else", "NTA. An insane reaction from your stepmom, and a disgusting cowardly response from your dad.", "NTA. \nYour mom sounds awesome.\n Your step mom and dad need to let you explore shit and let you find out what you like and what you don't. It's a vital part of being a teenager.", "NTA and good for you! You're old enough to decide for yourself what color you want your hair. Your stepmother is trying to assert authority over you that she doesn't actually have. She'd have to first convince your dad.\r  \n\r  \nYour dad says you're stubborn, and you are. That's a good thing, though. Standing up to arbitrary, unreasonable attempts at control is something to be applauded, not censured. Your dad is a doormat where his wife is concerned.\r  \n\r  \nKudos also to your mom for being firmly in your corner.", "NTA. Stepmom is being controlling to the point of borderline abusive, not to mention unreasonable (there is nothing about silver hair that insults old people). She has very weird ideas about what constitutes parenting. I wouldn't blame you for going NC once you turn 18.", "NTA.\n\nJust so you know, my mom, who is 69 and who's hair is 100% naturally light grey, *loves* this \"young people dyeing their hair silver\" trend. It makes her feel proud of her own hair.", "NTA. Ask your stepmother if older people who dye their hair brown or black are making fun of younger people.", "NTA. I'm approximately the same age as your stepmother, with a TON of silver hair of my own and I say you having silver hair is awesome! Her inability to accept that her hair is going gray is a her problem, not a you problem. Enjoy your awesome hair!", "NTA. \n\nHer claim that dying your hair silver is making fun of old people is ridiculous.  When someone dyes their hair blonde, it is not because they are mocking blonde people. It's because they think it's pretty and want to look that way too. If anything, she should be flattered that you want silver hair. This trend of young people dying their hair gray is helping to destigmatize gray hair for older people.\n\nWhen she said \"any other color\" did she mean literally any other color?  Like, she would have been okay with neon green? Or did she mean any other natural hair color because silver is going to make you stand out as a 'weird kid' and she thinks people are going to judge her for letting you be different? (That's still just a 'her' problem, btw)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
