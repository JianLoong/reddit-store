My parents divorced a year ago because my father cheated. He married the affair girlfriend like instantly.  I think he\u2019s a complete jerk and told the judge I wanted to live with my mom, so I do but they still said I had to go to my father\u2019s every other weekend. I don\u2019t want to see him, so I refused to go at first, but it was stressing my mom out with court stuff. I agreed to go as long as his wife is totally hands off and I can stay in my room and not be bothered except for one family activity of their choice. So that\u2019s where we are, every other weekend, my dad picks me up, talks at me in the car because I won\u2019t talk to him, we go to family therapy where everyone but me talks, I stay in my room until sometime Saturday when I go out with them to do something \u201cfun\u201d and then mostly stay in my room until my mom picks me up on Sunday. I have plenty of stuff to keep me busy, so I\u2019m fine, but everyone else not so much.\n\nAffair wife has kids (12F,9M) that would go to their dad\u2019s on my weekends so I never saw them but the schedule changed so now they\u2019re there when I am. 9M is fine, he asks to borrow a video game now and then but he\u2019s like polite about it and gives them back so sure. 12F won\u2019t leave me tf alone, any time I don\u2019t literally have my door locked she\u2019s barging in trying to talk to me or wanting to do something. I tried to tell her to leave me alone in a nice way, but last time I just up and told her I never want to talk to her and I\u2019m going to ignore her from now on. She cried about it, affair wife got mad, my father said she\u2019s having a hard time with the divorce too and I shouldn\u2019t take it out on her. I told him he could stop forcing me to visit then and problem solved.\n\nEveryone is mad. My mom says she gets it, but 12F probably is just looking for someone not her parents to talk to.

Text book, even.\n\nTo be clear, your dad is the AH, with an Honorable Mention for your stepmom.  Your dad wants a \"reset\" and for everyone to pretend like them screwing up two families was just  \"a thing that happened\" and everyone is supposed to pull together and be a family.\n\nThey did this to you, and to 12F and 9M. And your mom, and their dad.\n\nI will also bet you that 12F was told that she's \"gaining a sister\" and \"won't that be fun.\"  You are her consolation prize.  I can see how socializing with her seems like you are approving of the affair and the divorce and the whole mess, which you are not.\n\nIt's your life, and you certainly don't owe her or anyone anything.  But just remember that she is as blameless here as you are.\n\nEDIT to add:  Younger siblings are annoying no matter what.  Having younger step-siblings dumped on you at 15 (when you're not used to siblings at all) really sucks.", "I feel like the Y T A votes are missing the point. OP doesn\u2019t want a relationship AT ALL with the stepsibs and I believe that\u2019s a fair boundary. Her whole life has been upended and she mentions that she tried to be polite with the 12f to leave her alone but 12f (most likely blessing of stepmom) continued to ignore her request. Also: there is no real timeline given by OP which makes me think this has all happened so fast that OP hasn\u2019t been able to process it without adult interference. \n\nOP stated that she would have preferred to stay with mom full time but is being forced to spend time with dad (the court system in OPs state really dgaf about her mental health) and she let her bio dad and stepmom what her boundaries were and she kept to them. And now because 12f is around more often, she is being tasked against her freewill to cater to the feelings of another child while ignoring her own. Man. That\u2019s a lot for OP.  \n\nOP is NTA. But OP: I do suggest individual therapy for yourself. It might help you down the road when the courts revisit the custody agreement and they might rule in your favor this time.", "NTA. Dad needs to tell his wife to deal with her. kid.", "Hugs.  \n\nYour life, that other people control at 15, got flushed down the toilet.  You told the judge what you wanted and he only listened to half of it.  Now you are stuck dealing with the adults responsible for the flush which has to be salt in an open wound.  You are dealing with hurt and betrayal while being expected to act like a fully grown adult, when the actual adults did not.  Your feelings are valid.\n\nYour step siblings are in the same boat you are.  Hold your boundary of being left alone as kindly as you can when it comes to them.  They are grieving the life they lost as well.\n\nYou get to choose the relationship you have with your father.  Someday you may forgive him, or you may not.  No one has the right to tell/ guilt you what that relationship should be. \n\nYou are under court order to see him.  You have set your boundaries on what you are and are not willing to do in the situation that you are stuck in.  Talk to your mom about going back to court when some time has passed to get the order changed.  Until then do your best.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you cannot help feeling the way you do considering your dad is forcing you into a situation with a woman he betrayed your mother with. They\u2019re expecting this perfect blended family, but with zero time for you to heal.", "NTA - None of this is your problem.", "NTA fuckem. Try and change the order at 16 to never see him again.", "NTA fuckem. Try and change the order at 16 to never see him again.", "NTA. You are one of the victims here, not the therapist.", "NTA.  The 12 year old needs her own friends.  You tried to get her to leave you alone in a nice way and she completely ignored that.", "NTA.  Your life has been uprooted without your consent.  Of course you're angry and having a hard time adjusting.  Just try to remember that affairwife's kids didn't have a say in what happened either, just as you didn't have a say in the situation.  Try to remember that they're probably also having a difficult time adjusting, and can be your allies in tough times.  I wonder if you'd be willing to try to carve out some hang out time with the 12 year old, so that she has a designated time to talk your ear off.  You can be like \"ok but I need some quiet me time after this.  So I'll do X with you if you agree to honor my alone time.\"  Good luck, girl!", "NTA", "NTA.  But I hope you find some empathy for this 12 y/o girl.  She's in the same situation as you.  She's clearly dealing with this situation differently, try to be kind.  She's just as innocent as you are in this whole thing.", "NTA. Tell your father, you\u2019ll be happy to talk to the 12-year-old. Tell him you will explain the facts of life to her, and what an affair is, and how her mother and your father broke up both of their families or, he can just let you stay home with your mother.", "NTA. Your father cheated. He broke your mother's heart. Now he expects you to play house with his wife? I am against pettiness. I feel like the more you hold on to the affair, the more resentment you will have towards your father. This will potentially cause you more harm than you'd think. It will genuinely affect your relationship with other people as well. You don't see it now, but holding on to these type of native feelings will do more harm to you. I do suggest trying to move on from what your father did in the future, for your own sake.\n\nAs to your father, I think he is paying for the consequences of his affair. He can't expect to move on from what he did.\n\nAlso, I'd say that Y T A for lashing out at your dad's stepdaughter. This is just ONE example of how your resentment towards your father is doing you harm.\n\nI hope you find it in the heart to move on from this ordeal, it's quite a shitty situation but you really need to start healing in a positive way instead of fixating on what your father did. For your own sake.", "I get you.  My parents divorced when I was 14 and my dad married affair girlfriend instantly (without telling me or inviting me to the wedding).  I was angry with him for hurting my mom. I did not like affair wife.\n\nOne thing I never did was blame it on the kids.  They're just kids, this is not their fault.  Shutting them out is just you being stubborn to try to prove how unhappy you are.  You don't have to prove that, everyone knows it.\n\nThe important thing I'll say here is that my dad died three years after he left my mom and married affair girlfriend.  I was not over it all by then, I was still very, very angry.  So I never had a chance to resolve this before he died, which means I never get a chance to resolve it.\n\nYou don't have to forgive your dad, but you should get some therapy on your own to try to resolve your own anger.  Being angry is punishing them, for sure, but it also punishes you.  You can move on from this and still hold your dad accountable.", "NTA. But speak up in the next family therapy session and tell the therapist exactly how you feel about dad and the new family. A no holds barred session might get you closer to what you want. At the very least they will know you can't be therapied into submission.", "NTA \n\nIt doesn't have to be you. You aren't her  parent, sibling or therapist. No is a complete sentence.\n\nThe more years kiddo, and you're out and could be, forever....Maybe remind your dad of that", "NTA, you\u2019re old enough to decide wether you want to interact with someone or not.\n\nGeneral unsolicited advice that you can feel free to ignore : apart from the obvious problem between your parents (your father cheating) do you have any personal problem with your father ? It seems like he\u2019s trying to keep a relationship with you that you obviously refuse to. I don\u2019t know if there is any other reason and you totally don\u2019t have to disclose it if there is, but don\u2019t let the problems between your parents affect your relationship with them. Sometimes marriages don\u2019t work out and end up badly. What happened between your parents is between your parents. You have the right to feel resentful at your father since in this case he seems to be the one \u201cbreaking the family appart\u201d but at the end if the day there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and I\u2019m in no way defending your father but you might want to try since he seems to be trying too because after sometime the relationship might be destroyed and you might regret it later on.", "It's interesting that you get different opinions based on age and sub. You seem to be getting NTA votes here. I agree that you are not obligated to have a relationship. The only thing you should be encouraged to do when you are ready is to come to terms with how you want to navigate your relationship with your father.\n\nAnother similar post for a 20 year old with no relationship with her half sister had the community painting her as the asshole for not wanting to go to sister's graduation. https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/156jd3g/aiw_for_rejecting_my_little_sisters_invitation_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1\n\nIn the end, your own mental health is what is important. But until you are of age and aren't forced to go to your father's house, hopefully everyone can try to be respectful and not toxic.", "YTA, I emphasise with you and your situation but taking it out on the 12 year old girl isn't helping things to be honest with you. Won't make you or her feel any better.\n\nI would suggest trying out the therapy with the family, give it a willing attempt at fixing things or finding better ways of communicating things that bother you about your circumstances to your family.", "YTA Not because you despise your dad or because you want nothing to do with his affair wife. You're not even the asshole for wanting 12f to leave you alone. YTA for how you handled it. You acted cruel and mean. It really sounds like you took all of your anger and pain from your dad cheating and unloaded it on your step sibling. Your time is your own, and you don't have to hang out with her, but you do owe her an apology for how you handled things.", "YTA\n\nUgh, being 15 is tough. Being 15 and having your parents go through a divorce like this is even rougher.   \n\n\nTwo things though, first, your stepsiblings are in the same situation as you and being mean to them helps no one.  \nSecond, your dad made a huge mistake, but he's still your dad. I know the trauma is new, but I think it would be helpful to go to therapy on your own to help deal with these feelings, because he will be your dad forever.", "I\u2019m really torn about this because you\u2019re so young. \n\nBeing rude to a 12 y/o wouldn\u2019t be acceptable behavior for an adult. But you\u2019re 15 and your whole life was uprooted, which warrants a certain level of empathy. \n\n12yo didn\u2019t do anything to you. Your resentment is towards your dad. You shouldn\u2019t take it out on her. You\u2019re a few years older, so she probably just wants to hang out with you because she thinks you\u2019re cool. I feel sad for her. Her life got upended too, and the highlight of her weekends with her mom is probably the time she spends with you. I know it\u2019s hard to see outside yourself right now, but think on that. \n\nYou said you don\u2019t talk in family therapy but you articulated your reasons for being angry with your father very well in a reply among the comments. I highly recommend saying exactly what you\u2019ve said here in family therapy. \n\nAny therapist worth their salt is going to tell you that this anger is *valid* and you have every right to be upset that your entire life and routine was disheveled for reasons entirely out of your control. And they will likely encourage your father to acknowledge the hurt that he\u2019s caused you in all of this. From there, **you take back some control.** The ball will be in your court to decide how you want to respond and move forward, or not.\n\nEdit: gently going to say ESH aside from your mum and the other kids.", "YTA. You probably should give therapy a try. You're so mad at your dad for cheating but there's always 2 sides to every story. Why was he so unhappy he cheated and broke up his family? Also... Their marriage isn't YOUR business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You can then tell them exactly how you feel, and they can give you the best advice on how to handle the situation.  They can also advocate for you to your dad.  If it gets really bad, they may even be able to intervene on your behalf to the courts.  They could also be a really good ally, so I'd be transparent with them if I were you.  If you ask to speak with them privately and your dad says no, that alone will tell the therapist a LOT about your family dynamic, and how much you are able to express yourself.  The fact that you are very cognizant of what you feel and why you feel it shows that you are incredibly intelligent.", "I\u2019d run away before that happened.  Or take a baseball bat to his living room and go to jail instead.  Idc what happens to me as much anymore, I\u2019m not letting him bully my mom."]}
