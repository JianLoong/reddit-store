I don\u2019t want to see him, so I refused to go at first, but it was stressing my mom out with court stuff. I agreed to go as long as his wife is totally hands off and I can stay in my room and not be bothered except for one family activity of their choice. So that\u2019s where we are, every other weekend, my dad picks me up, talks at me in the car because I won\u2019t talk to him, we go to family therapy where everyone but me talks, I stay in my room until sometime Saturday when I go out with them to do something \u201cfun\u201d and then mostly stay in my room until my mom picks me up on Sunday. I have plenty of stuff to keep me busy, so I\u2019m fine, but everyone else not so much.\n\nAffair wife has kids (12F,9M) that would go to their dad\u2019s on my weekends so I never saw them but the schedule changed so now they\u2019re there when I am. 9M is fine, he asks to borrow a video game now and then but he\u2019s like polite about it and gives them back so sure. 12F won\u2019t leave me tf alone, any time I don\u2019t literally have my door locked she\u2019s barging in trying to talk to me or wanting to do something. I tried to tell her to leave me alone in a nice way, but last time I just up and told her I never want to talk to her and I\u2019m going to ignore her from now on. She cried about it, affair wife got mad, my father said she\u2019s having a hard time with the divorce too and I shouldn\u2019t take it out on her. I told him he could stop forcing me to visit then and problem solved.\n\nEveryone is mad. My mom says she gets it, but 12F probably is just looking for someone not her parents to talk to.

Text book, even.\n\nTo be clear, your dad is the AH, with an Honorable Mention for your stepmom.  Your dad wants a \"reset\" and for everyone to pretend like them screwing up two families was just  \"a thing that happened\" and everyone is supposed to pull together and be a family.\n\nThey did this to you, and to 12F and 9M. And your mom, and their dad.\n\nI will also bet you that 12F was told that she's \"gaining a sister\" and \"won't that be fun.\"  You are her consolation prize.  I can see how socializing with her seems like you are approving of the affair and the divorce and the whole mess, which you are not.\n\nIt's your life, and you certainly don't owe her or anyone anything.  But just remember that she is as blameless here as you are.\n\nEDIT to add:  Younger siblings are annoying no matter what.  Having younger step-siblings dumped on you at 15 (when you're not used to siblings at all) really sucks.", "I feel like the Y T A votes are missing the point. OP doesn\u2019t want a relationship AT ALL with the stepsibs and I believe that\u2019s a fair boundary. Her whole life has been upended and she mentions that she tried to be polite with the 12f to leave her alone but 12f (most likely blessing of stepmom) continued to ignore her request. Also: there is no real timeline given by OP which makes me think this has all happened so fast that OP hasn\u2019t been able to process it without adult interference. \n\nOP stated that she would have preferred to stay with mom full time but is being forced to spend time with dad (the court system in OPs state really dgaf about her mental health) and she let her bio dad and stepmom what her boundaries were and she kept to them. And now because 12f is around more often, she is being tasked against her freewill to cater to the feelings of another child while ignoring her own. Man. That\u2019s a lot for OP.  \n\nOP is NTA. But OP: I do suggest individual therapy for yourself. It might help you down the road when the courts revisit the custody agreement and they might rule in your favor this time.\n\n\nEdited to add: OMG THANK YOU FOR THE AWARDS!!!! And to OP: you have the majority of us rooting for you \u2764\ufe0f ignore the haters.", "NTA. Dad needs to tell his wife to deal with her. kid.", "Hugs.  \n\nYour life, that other people control at 15, got flushed down the toilet.  You told the judge what you wanted and he only listened to half of it.  Now you are stuck dealing with the adults responsible for the flush which has to be salt in an open wound.  You are dealing with hurt and betrayal while being expected to act like a fully grown adult, when the actual adults did not.  Your feelings are valid.\n\nYour step siblings are in the same boat you are.  Hold your boundary of being left alone as kindly as you can when it comes to them.  They are grieving the life they lost as well.\n\nYou get to choose the relationship you have with your father.  Someday you may forgive him, or you may not.  No one has the right to tell/ guilt you what that relationship should be. \n\nYou are under court order to see him.  You have set your boundaries on what you are and are not willing to do in the situation that you are stuck in.  Talk to your mom about going back to court when some time has passed to get the order changed.  Until then do your best.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you cannot help feeling the way you do considering your dad is forcing you into a situation with a woman he betrayed your mother with.

The 12 year old needs her own friends.  You tried to get her to leave you alone in a nice way and she completely ignored that.", "NTA.  Your life has been uprooted without your consent.  Of course you're angry and having a hard time adjusting.  Just try to remember that affairwife's kids didn't have a say in what happened either, just as you didn't have a say in the situation.  Try to remember that they're probably also having a difficult time adjusting, and can be your allies in tough times.  I wonder if you'd be willing to try to carve out some hang out time with the 12 year old, so that she has a designated time to talk your ear off.  You can be like \"ok but I need some quiet me time after this.  So I'll do X with you if you agree to honor my alone time.\"  Good luck, girl!", "NTA", "NTA.

Your father cheated. He broke your mother's heart. Now he expects you to play house with his wife? I am against pettiness. I feel like the more you hold on to the affair, the more resentment you will have towards your father. This will potentially cause you more harm than you'd think. It will genuinely affect your relationship with other people as well. You don't see it now, but holding on to these type of native feelings will do more harm to you. I do suggest trying to move on from what your father did in the future, for your own sake.\n\nAs to your father, I think he is paying for the consequences of his affair. He can't expect to move on from what he did.\n\nAlso, I'd say that Y T A for lashing out at your dad's stepdaughter. This is just ONE example of how your resentment towards your father is doing you harm.\n\nI hope you find it in the heart to move on from this ordeal, it's quite a shitty situation but you really need to start healing in a positive way instead of fixating on what your father did. For your own sake.", "I get you.  My parents divorced when I was 14 and my dad married affair girlfriend instantly (without telling me or inviting me to the wedding).  I was angry with him for hurting my mom. I did not like affair wife.\n\nOne thing I never did was blame it on the kids.  They're just kids, this is not their fault.  Shutting them out is just you being stubborn to try to prove how unhappy you are.  You don't have to prove that, everyone knows it.\n\nThe important thing I'll say here is that my dad died three years after he left my mom and married affair girlfriend.  I was not over it all by then, I was still very, very angry.  So I never had a chance to resolve this before he died, which means I never get a chance to resolve it.\n\nYou don't have to forgive your dad, but you should get some therapy on your own to try to resolve your own anger.  Being angry is punishing them, for sure, but it also punishes you.  You can move on from this and still hold your dad accountable.", "NTA. But speak up in the next family therapy session and tell the therapist exactly how you feel about dad and the new family. A no holds barred session might get you closer to what you want. At the very least they will know you can't be therapied into submission.", "NTA \n\nIt doesn't have to be you. You aren't her  parent, sibling or therapist. No is a complete sentence.\n\nThe more years kiddo, and you're out and could be, forever....Maybe remind your dad of that", "[deleted]", "It's interesting that you get different opinions based on age and sub. You seem to be getting NTA votes here. I agree that you are not obligated to have a relationship. The only thing you should be encouraged to do when you are ready is to come to terms with how you want to navigate your relationship with your father.\n\nAnother similar post for a 20 year old with no relationship with her half sister had the community painting her as the asshole for not wanting to go to sister's graduation. https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/156jd3g/aiw_for_rejecting_my_little_sisters_invitation_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1\n\nIn the end, your own mental health is what is important. But until you are of age and aren't forced to go to your father's house, hopefully everyone can try to be respectful and not toxic.", "YTA, I emphasise with you and your situation but taking it out on the 12 year old girl isn't helping things to be honest with you. Won't make you or her feel any better.\n\nI would suggest trying out the therapy with the family, give it a willing attempt at fixing things or finding better ways of communicating things that bother you about your circumstances to your family.", "YTA Not because you despise your dad or because you want nothing to do with his affair wife. You're not even the asshole for wanting 12f to leave you alone. YTA for how you handled it. You acted cruel and mean. It really sounds like you took all of your anger and pain from your dad cheating and unloaded it on your step sibling. Your time is your own, and you don't have to hang out with her, but you do owe her an apology for how you handled things.", "YTA\n\nUgh, being 15 is tough. Being 15 and having your parents go through a divorce like this is even rougher.   \n\n\nTwo things though, first, your stepsiblings are in the same situation as you and being mean to them helps no one.  \nSecond, your dad made a huge mistake, but he's still your dad. I know the trauma is new, but I think it would be helpful to go to therapy on your own to help deal with these feelings, because he will be your dad forever.", "I\u2019m really torn about this because you\u2019re so young. \n\nBeing rude to a 12 y/o wouldn\u2019t be acceptable behavior for an adult. But you\u2019re 15 and your whole life was uprooted, which warrants a certain level of empathy. \n\n12yo didn\u2019t do anything to you. Your resentment is towards your dad. You shouldn\u2019t take it out on her. You\u2019re a few years older, so she probably just wants to hang out with you because she thinks you\u2019re cool. I feel sad for her. Her life got upended too, and the highlight of her weekends with her mom is probably the time she spends with you. I know it\u2019s hard to see outside yourself right now, but think on that. \n\nYou said you don\u2019t talk in family therapy but you articulated your reasons for being angry with your father very well in a reply among the comments. I highly recommend saying exactly what you\u2019ve said here in family therapy. \n\nAny therapist worth their salt is going to tell you that this anger is *valid* and you have every right to be upset that your entire life and routine was disheveled for reasons entirely out of your control. And they will likely encourage your father to acknowledge the hurt that he\u2019s caused you in all of this. From there, **you take back some control.** The ball will be in your court to decide how you want to respond and move forward, or not.\n\nEdit: gently going to say ESH aside from your mum and the other kids.", "YTA. You probably should give therapy a try. You're so mad at your dad for cheating but there's always 2 sides to every story. Why was he so unhappy he cheated and broke up his family? Also...

Your dad and stepmother have made their bed and need to lie in it. They need to understand that their kids don't.

It sucks, it's a bad situation, and you have every right to be angry at everyone involved. However as a grown adult I do have some advice to give you. It's probably not what you want to hear, but: being angry isn't going to fix anything. Nothing will change because you close up and stop talking. It will just make you lose precious years of your childhood to anger.\n\nYour dad messed up. That was a horrible thing for him to do, but it does happen. Parents fall out of love with each other and do things they regret. Divorce is awful (I am a child of divorce so I know this first hand). Stepsiblings can also be awful. It'll feel like your family has fallen apart.\n\nHowever, these things won't change. You will be angry for all of your teen years and then when you're an adult there won't be much change. You may have to go through years of therapy just to trust or open up to people again. It's a long, hard road. You may never forgive your father and that's up to you.\n\nHowever there is an alternative. You can accept that you just can't change some things, and that while your feelings and anger are valid, you don't have to live a life of anger. Open up bit by bit and communicate with your father. I know he was wrong, but if he still loves you and wants a relationship with you that is a valuable thing that not everyone has. Tell him how you really feel, and that he needs to earn your trust again. Work together with him to have some kind of a relationship. You only get one family and one father, so don't throw it away because of anger.\n\nAs for your younger step-sibling, no one can make you like her. However none of this is her fault. She is just a small child looking up to a cool older sibling, and she seems to want to have a relationship with you. Try talking to her, tell her you're sorry for being mean, but that the situation isn't easy for you. You could make a wonderful friend and sister if you put anger aside. Like it or not she's going to be around you for the rest of your life, and while you don't have to be nice to her, wouldn't you rather have more positive relationships instead of closing people out because you're angry?\n\nI would just think about it, if nothing else. These things hurt, but it also hurts to look back on your life and see you closed everyone out because of anger. It leads to nothing but isolation and further hurt.\n\n**Edit:** Not sure why I'm being downvoted? This is just my advice to a kid because I've been there. I have a feeling there's some very angry kids of divorce out there who don't like what I said.\n\nI'm looking at other totally well meaning comments that have been downvoted to hell too and wondering why some of you have so much damage. Seriously.", "YTA. your attitude is horrible. 12f is in the same boat as your are. She is trying to make the best of it. Stop taking everything out on her. It is not her fault the affair happened.

The good news is that you're fifteen and most fifteen year olds are not very nice. No surprise. It's a rough time of life under the best of circumstances and you've been dealt a difficult hand of cards. That is not an excuse for being mean. \n\nYou're approaching adulthood. Start acting like it. You don't have to engage with your stepsister but there is no reason to be mean to someone who is going through pretty much the same mess you are. If anything, she has it worse because she has to live with the parent who cheated. \n\nTime to show you are growing up. You don't have to talk to your father or your stepmother or your step-siblings but you shouldn't be mean to them. It's perfectly okay to say \"I don't want to be here. I don't want to talk to you. Please leave me alone.\" You don't have to engage. Just respond to everything with the same mantra (look it up if you aren't sure what the word means). \n\nThree other thoughts.\n\n1. I know your mother is worn out from court. Courts however do listen to older children and their desires get consideration. If your mother can stand another pass, you can see if you can get visitation waived. If that doesn't work, try for an afternoon visit with no sleepover. Better--in your case shorter--is better, right? \n2. The time is going to come when your mother recovers enough from her pain and hurt to date. Please try to be nice to those people. You don't have to like them. You should be nice. It's okay to tell your mother how you feel. It is not okay to be rude to either the dates or your mother. She deserves a life. \n3. Ease up on the swearing. Even acronyms as you posted are not a good look. I infer (homework: look up the difference between 'infer' and 'imply') you were more blunt with your stepsister. Swearing doesn't make you look older. It just makes you look like you don't know how to communicate. If you get in the habit of swearing something will slip out and you'll lose an opportunity in school/college or at work that you will regret. Be better than that. \n\nGive your mother a hug. Try to be a decent person, even to people you don't like (stepsister) or are mad at (father). \n\nTotal assessment: NTA but being childish and not nice. Grow up.", "At some point in your life you will wish you spoke about your feelings directly to him.

I hope you can find a way to speak your truth to him.", "NTA, but you still suck to be honest. I can understand your animosity towards your father (him saying the divorce is hard on him too is rich to me since he is essentially the cause of the divorce), but your step siblings have nothing to do with that.

Even if you can't stand your father and stepmother, you might find having a younger sibling kind of fun.

It was a whole clusterfuck and I wanted out. \n\nThank god I recognized my mental health was spiraling and I made myself go to therapy. My therapist helped me implement an information diet on my parents relationship, was there for me in ways my parents weren\u2019t, and helped me work on my resentment/hate of my father and the situation I was stuck in. That was the worst part; feeling so trapped. Therapy helped me find outlets and ways to be separated from the situation in a healthy way. \n\nThe biggest motivator on why I went to therapy and stuck with it was I didn\u2019t want to become my father. A miserable person stuck on every slight to them in the past and who then takes it out on other people including their loved ones. I have learned in therapy that I don\u2019t have to forgive and/or forget what my father did, but I can still love him because he\u2019s my Dad. Regardless of how I feel on the decisions he has made.

My mum walked out one night, no reason why (still don't know)\n\nMy dad forgave her, I still don't trust that she won't do the same thing again.", "Question about the downvotes. I'd like to know if it's because you hate the idea, hate that I brought it up, don't believe in the Reddit posts I've referred to, feel that it *is* black and white, or other?\n\nI'm not going to argue, just curious.\n\nETA: Thanks for the comment.
