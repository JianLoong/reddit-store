{"id": 6123, "submission_id": "zzz41t", "title": "AITA for not eating my coworkers' food?", "selftext": "  \n\nMy hubby was hired by a construction company and put on a team with several other laborers. They\u2019ve been pretty cool for the most part and he enjoys the work. But a problem has been occurring over lunch every day. The others all share food for lunch (this isn\u2019t a problem; I think it\u2019s actually kinda cool). So at lunchtime they all started assembling their meal and hubby got out his lunchbox. We\u2019ve been making a push for healthy eating so I\u2019ve been packing healthy meals. The coworkers invited him to share their food and he thanked them but explained that he\u2019s trying to eat a specific way. They kept pressuring him to try it until he finally had some, which he enjoyed, and thanked them. He then offered to share his food but they weren\u2019t interested (he wasn\u2019t offended; there\u2019s a cultural difference as well as being \u201cweird\u201d healthy food).\n\nThis same scenario played out day after day. They pushed him to eat some of their food and were offended if he wouldn\u2019t. But they would never eat his, even if I made less healthy things like cookies, brownies, or sandwiches to send along. Again, this wasn\u2019t really offensive\u2026we\u2019re a different culture than the rest of the coworkers and we get that they prefer the food they\u2019re used to. The problem was that some resentment started to build that hubby was \u201calways eating their food\u201d and not reciprocating (no matter how much he tried).\n\nOne of the coworkers finally told my husband that he needed to take the whole team out to a nice restaurant to make up for all the food of theirs he\u2019d eaten. He explained that this was not feasible since we\u2019re on a tight budget (it would be a true hardship for us), but that he\u2019d be glad to bring a homemade meal to share. They were upset since they don\u2019t like the food we make and told him that wasn\u2019t fair and that he was using them. He ended up buying them their favorite sodas as an affordable compromise and stopped accepting any of their food, using the excuse that he\u2019s trying to stick to his diet. So now they\u2019re upset that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be part of the team\u201d and still think he owes them.\n\nI can totally understand the team both wanting him to share what the others were eating AND feeling like he should reciprocate, but it feels like we haven\u2019t been left with any feasible options since they won\u2019t accept the food we make and we can't afford a lavish restaurant meal (they've refused some cheaper options). It may be worth adding that since my hubby is the newest member of the team, he makes less than any of the others. Plus we have young children and many of the others are single or have grown kids so they\u2019re more financially stable. I\u2019m sure that some of this can be chalked up to cross-cultural misunderstanding, but we're just wondering if there's something we're not seeing here. Is he a jerk for refusing to buy them an expensive dinner and now refusing to eat more of their food?", "created_utc": 1672507799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzz41t/aita_for_not_eating_my_coworkers_food/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband was pushed into eating their food having initially declined, but they weren't interested in his food due to it being healthy and a 'cultural difference'? You then ensured your husband had less healthy food to share, including cookies and brownies, which you'd made especially for them but they still declined. Then they tried to tell your husband he owed them a meal at a restaurant to pay them back for food that your husband had tried to decline in the first place?\n\nThat sounds like your husband's co-workers planned it so they could be taken out to a nice restaurant on your husband's dime.\n\nAt best, your husband's co-workers are jerks.\n\nYou are your husband have done nothing wrong.\n\nETA: Sorry, forgot to add...

And then they complain that he's not sharing his food?", "NTA...this just weird and they are disrespectful. The won't take his food and then complain that he doesn't share? What kind of sense does that make? They sound like bullies. Tell him to keep his head down, work hard and don't take or offer any more food. Honestly, he should probably start looking for a new job. That sounds like a terrible environment to work in.", "NTA\n\nWhat an odd work dynamic. Your husband doesn\u2019t owe them crap.", "NTA \u00d7 100. At a minimum, your husband's coworkers are acting like jerks, but given that you are from a different culture, I'd be inclined to assume there's racism at work here too, especially if the coworkers are all white.", "NTA. This dynamic is just weird.\n\nMaybe yall could offer to buy the ingredients for a meal that they could make and have for lunch? Or ask them for some of their favorite recipes and try to cook them?", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s coworkers changed the terms of the \u201cagreement\u201d for him and to his disadvantage. While they get to share food, sort of like a potluck, he has to treat the group to a lavish meal in a restaurant to fit in. This smacks of bullying\u2014there\u2019s an imbalance of power (the others belong to a different cultural group and your husband is an outsider) and the behavior (the insistence he reciprocate in a way they choose) is repeated.", "NTA, He should stop eating their food\n\nThey sound weird af", "NTA all the way 'round.

Please, do not make it necessary for me to become unpleasant.\"", "NTA His coworkers sound like a bunch of bullies and I suspect this not really about the food, but the cultural difference you mention. They\u2019re picking on him for being a little different from them and keep moving the goalposts so nothing he does is acceptable to them. \n\nEven if he\u2019d agreed to buy them an expensive dinner, they would have found something wrong with it and come up with new demands. He\u2019s right not to eat their food, the price is too high. I don\u2019t see why he should buy them sodas either. I think he should eat his meal and try to ignore their comments.", "I was married to a construction worker. They are hazing him as the greenhorn on the team.
