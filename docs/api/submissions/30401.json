I honesty didn\u2019t realize how overly involved his family is in their lives until we moved to the city where he grew up/they live.

We didn\u2019t have this issue when we lived 100 miles away and it only got worse when our son was born because he\u2019s the only grandchild.", "I\u2019ve tried to have this conversation so many times and even suggested couples\u2019 counseling to help communicate more clearly but he\u2019s very closed off to it. That\u2019s why I got angry- I feel like I\u2019m having the same discussion over and over again and nothing changes.", "I think I posted this wrong- there is no difference in quality between our neighborhood school and the school down the street. We live in affluent area and the public schools are excellent. She taught at the school down the street from her house decades ago and the family friends I mentioned have kids who go there. I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re pushing it which is valid- knowing people at the school will make the transition from preK to elementary easier but I think it\u2019s just one factor to consider and I don\u2019t like she thinks she gets a say in educational decision making.", "I\u2019ve told him this so many times to no avail. What kills me is his family thinks they\u2019re close but they\u2019re the epitome of WASPs- they never discuss anything uncomfortable. My husband struggles with serious MH issues since the pandemic and I was the only one who supported him and encouraged him to get help while his family swept it under the table. It infuriates me that I have stood by him through such a terrible time and I\u2019m still treated like I don\u2019t matter as much.", "I\u2019ve tried so many times and nothing changes.

I really at my wits\u2019 end and don\u2019t know what to do about this dynamic.", "Whats worse is his sister treats him like a spouse even though she\u2019s married.

We automatically go to the neighborhood school or you can enter a lottery for a different school. She offered to use her home address so he can qualify for the school down the street from her house. The Spanish immersion school isn\u2019t our neighborhood school so we would have to enter the lottery and there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll get in.", "I think his mom and sister would shit their pants if they saw me in full mama bear mode- I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s so hesitant to have me speak with them directly.", "Unfortunately, it sounds like you either have to accept it, or take more drastic measures.

If he gets mad, remind him that you were the one that birthed him.", "I\u2019m not surprised at all. And I imagine it\u2019s all by mom\u2019s design.", "The problem arises if the board of education finds out you children don't reside in at your mother in law's house, you can get arrested and fined the tuition cost and penalties. It's illegal to use someone else's address.", "NTA. Definitely not worth even humoring this idea. Kid should do lottery or go to neighborhood school.", "I don\u2019t know if it is but this is my son and he\u2019s the most important person in my life. I know if push came to shove, I would pick him over my husband and maybe that\u2019s what I need to tell him.", "I think fear is the big factor- what if this means my marriage ends? I am from out of state and would be stuck here if we divorced because family courts are reluctant to move a child out of state post divorce. I have built a good life here and have great friends so I know I would be okay but the thought of my marriage ending because my husband can\u2019t stand up to his mom and sister breaks my heart. It makes me feel like I\u2019m not worthwhile.", "Mom is way too involved. I remember his sister got mad at us when we didn\u2019t go to her 2020 New Year\u2019s party because a little thing called COVID. Instead of discussing it with her brother, SIL complained to MIL who complained to my husband. It took so much energy to not rip all of them new assholes for being obtuse.", "It really irked me when she said that because I grew up in a very poor community of color and we used my parents\u2019 employer\u2019s address so I could go to a better school. In our district certain numbers of spots are saved at affluent schools for kids who live in areas with schools that are not as good. Not only did it remind me of my upbringing, I\u2019m also a defense attorney for children and I see daily how school quality impacts these kids\u2019 lives. It made me feel like she wants to take an opportunity away from a child who needs it for my son, who honestly, is incredibly privileged. It felt like it was undermining how I\u2019m trying to raise my son- to know he\u2019s very lucky and not everyone has what he has.", "She also offered it sua sponte- like the decision was already made he would go to that school and it was just a matter of figuring out how he could attend.", "No doubt! You and your husband are the most important people in your son's life, as well. You have as much right to be heard as your husband, and more so than your MIL and SIL.", "No offense but I can\u2019t stand men like your husband. I think it\u2019s because my mom tried to raise me to have that exact kind of codependency and I was never having it.", "I honestly didn\u2019t realize this dynamic existed until we moved here after we got married. It got worse when our son was born. It infuriates me because my husband is such an amazing person who shrinks himself to maintain the dynamic that has always existed in his family which is the sister is the golden child. I think that\u2019s a big reason he behaves like this because all things considered, his sister has squandered every opportunity she\u2019s had and is happy to live off her family money while my husband used his privilege to help others.", "You can\u2019t let your kid go to the school by grandma. At all. It\u2019s going to be like injecting steroids into the enmeshment."]}
