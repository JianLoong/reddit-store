I put my foot down on that very quickly because our school district reserves a certain number of spots in more affluent schools for kids who live in less affluent areas. Even if it wasn\u2019t a potential felony, morally, I\u2019m against taking an opportunity away from a child who needs it for my son, who is incredibly privileged. We live in a very affluent area so our neighborhood school is just as good as the school near her house so she doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. I\u2019ve told my husband several times that logistically, it will make our lives easier to walk three blocks instead of driving two miles and his mom is retired so she can make the sacrifice of driving a couple miles if she wants to be \u201chelpful.\u201d The only reason I\u2019m considering the Spanish immersion program is because I want my son to speak my native language and for some reason, he\u2019s very averse to learning from me.

That honestly makes me so sad. I grew up at a time when there was a lot of anti- Latino sentiment and I openly admit I tried to hide my heritage because well, kids are mean and dumb.

He needs to be a husband first", "I can totally understand that. Even typing out the d word is a big deal, and its terrifying to consider all the possible hardships that might ensue. And how heartbreaking to think you might not be \"worthwhile\" for him to prioritize. \n\nThat's all the more reason to bring this up now: the sooner you do, the less time you have to build up resentment to the point of no return. Your child is still young and your family dynamic is still more flexible. I'm not saying there won't be any resistance -- everyone in the family will push against you. But the longer this goes on, the more \"out of the blue\" it will seem for you to put your foot down on this matter for everyone involved. If your worst fears are confirmed and he decides to outwardly and unashamedly prioritize his mother and SIL's opinions over yours, it will hurt, but at least you will have learned it sooner. Putting it off won't change that, and will only further encourage his behavior to go unchecked, allow resentment or apathy to build, and delay the inevitable. Sunk cost fallacy.\n\nYou are worthwhile.

Kids usually get accustomed to their school, even if it takes them a while. It sounds like the big benefit of the school close to your MIL, is that she knows many of the teachers and families there, which will give her power in terms of ensuring that if you don't fall in line with her wishes, you'll be ostracized by her friends who are powerful at the school. That would not be good for you. \n\nWhat are the good things about your relationship with your husband? Is he the type of person who, if you let him know he's crossing a line with you, will step back because he realizes he may lose you? Or is he the type of person who just thinks you should do whatever he wants, no matter how hurtful it is to you?", "I hate to say it,  but could they be racist? They don't want him to learn Spanish, and no one, including your own husband, respects your opinion. Only yours and his opinions matter, I'd keep letting them know that.

When your DH says he has the options, advise him that you also have done the ground work for schools and it would need to be a mutual decision.\n\nI'd ask DH why he thinks he gets to make decisions on your behalf?  What kind of marriage does he want because right now it is not a happy one!", "I had a student in my class who was not in our neighborhood and was using grandma's address. They found out and I know grandma was fined and got no jail time. It was April, so they did let her finish the school year.", "And yet how the heck is it still up as a possible option?", "What is your husband's position on this and do you have it documented anywhere in writing, such as emails? I don't think it would be appreciated by the legal system (e.g. re custody) if he was asking you, an attorney, to do something illegal, to please his mother. \n\nI think the correct response to his mother here is, \"Are you out of your mind? It would be illegal. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you suggest it. Billy is going to be going to our neighborhood school or to the Spanish immersion school, if Steve and I decide to put in the lottery for that.\"", "It is very google-able \ud83d\ude0a. \"Don't rock the boat Reddit\". Your husband could do with a read through too by your description of his family set-up. Don't expect miracles from an essay though. Just fight for what you think is best. That's all.", "Thank you for this. I think a big reason I have such a hard time standing up is because my husband comes from generational wealth and I am first generation immigrant with zero money. A big fear is that a divorce would turn nasty because of how his mom and sister are behaving and I don\u2019t have the financial resources he has. I am an attorney and know my rights and will fight like hell for my son but it\u2019s a lot harder when I have to work for a living and he can easily live off literally millions of dollars.", "He\u2019s definitely the former- this is only really an issue with his family and it\u2019s part of this gross, co-dependent dynamic. I honestly think my husband is one of the best people I\u2019ve ever known- he\u2019s compassionate, generous, funny, intelligent, and a truly talented attorney. I think of the person he was when we lived 100 miles away and the person he\u2019s become (or reverted to) when we moved here and it breaks my heart. His sister, to put it mildly, is a stereotypical trust fund kid who has squandered the very fortunate hand life dealt her. Like, she\u2019s one of those people who peaked in high school and everyone knows it. I recently found out his friends can\u2019t stand her because she\u2019s so needy and clingy. I think she can\u2019t deal with having the best years past her and instead of working to improve herself, the family has reverted to the childhood dynamics of she\u2019s the center of the family because she used to be the golden child and my husband, for whatever reason, just goes along with it. I think she\u2019s also jealous of me because I took her brother from her and because despite the fact I came from very little, I have built a very successful life. You have given me a lot to think about re: why my MIL is so desperate for our son to go to her neighborhood school. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that conniving but it does give her more opportunity to become involved in our lives. I also very much appreciate the advice about school location vis a vis my job- I honestly hadn\u2019t thought about it and is incredibly helpful. Thank you.", "Oh wow. Good for you. Don\u2019t hear that too often!", "I hope not because my MIL is half Latina so it would be self hating racists.", "I actually know a fair amount about these schools because of my work and my friends- I learned about the Spanish immersion from a good friend whose son goes there! I honestly don\u2019t know what my husband wants- I\u2019ve told him multiple times ever since we moved here that he makes me feel like he wanted to go back to his life pre-me and I\u2019m just dropped into\nIt instead of creating a life together. We spend holidays, birthdays, celebrations, etc with his family which I didn\u2019t mind before but now it irritates me because it\u2019s the default and I am not against it per se, I just want it to be OUR decision. For example, we spent Christmas with my family a couple years ago and my MIL told him she got Christmas the following year. It didn\u2019t occur to him how fucked that was until I told him- like, what kind of mother thinks she gets to\ndictate her grown son\u2019s life?!", "I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t incarcerate her- I may not be a fan of my MIL but I\u2019m also not a fan of our carceral state!", "I told my husband I will not allow using the address but the lottery is still a possibility. I don\u2019t think lottery is the right word because it\u2019s not completely random- it\u2019s more like ranked choice and the school district looks at various factors, including connection to the community.", "Oh you poor thing! So his family is entitled and used to getting their own way. What a drag. It\u2019ll be worth the fight though to not have your self-esteem constantly attacked.", "I'm sure other people have mentioned this. But maybe check out the reddit justnomil page.", "Is moving again an option? It sounds like you would all do better further away from his family.", "You\u2019re the first to suggest- thank you!"]}
