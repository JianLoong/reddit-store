If he isn\u2019t joking, he genuinely believes this stuff is happening and for his friend to question that, it will hurt him. He probably thinks he\u2019s completely sane. I would speak to others that are close to him and see if they noticed anything too, perhaps a group discussion would be a better approach.", "NTA. I would also recommend he see a neurologist.

He is clearly showing delusional tendencies.\r  \n\r  \nI don't know what's the best way to approach the topic. However, as your goal is to help your friend. I believe that you should talk to a professional in the area before taking any action (receiving instructions), so that he does not immediately reject the idea. In case it is not possible, since it is a complex action to contact specialists (\"only by an acquaintance\"), I would recommend that you contact his family and close friends to expose the problem, and later, talk directly to him. So at least you've done more than necessary to try to help him. Then, as he is an adult and his family members (those responsible for him), would have to take the next steps to help him. What could you do, you already did.\r  \n\r  \nIt is important, that you are prepared for his answer, that\r  \nit would probably lead to the end of their friendship.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are going to deal with the issue directly, research methods for doing so. You can look up reports and tutorials on the internet.\r  \n\r  \nOn Reddit it is common to find communities that support these toxic delusions. And as such, it is common to find former members of these communities, saying that the delusions stopped, after consultation with doctors.\r  \n*\\* Type the community who believe they are always being followed by government agents. It is common for its former members to report that they were identified with schizophrenia, and after taking the correct medication (indicated by the doctor), the followers disappeared. Sadly, those still in the community dismiss the former members, saying they were \"captured or whatever\".*", "NTA he either really needs help of he's faking it", "NTA\n\nGet that fucking guy to a hospital", "NTA, but look up NAMI or other resources for talking to folks about their mental health before you make a move. If not handled carefully, this can go badly.", "You would not be the asshole - NTA! \n\nHere is advice I\u2019ve received from mental health pros when a relative was hospitalized: \n\nDo not try to argue that what your friend saw is impossible or not real. It *feels* real to him when it is happening, and proving it\u2019s not won\u2019t fix the problem. Instead, validate his feelings and your own reality. Like, don\u2019t ever pretend you see it too, or lie, but say something like \u201cthat must have been very scary\u201d or better yet, ask how he felt when he saw it. \u201cHow did you feel? Were you scared? What do you think was going on? What do you want to do if you see something like that again?\u201d Make it clear that you are glad he told you. \n\nFrom there, if he opens up, ask if he would consider talking to someone about it. Something like, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that when people around your age start seeing things they can\u2019t explain or that others can\u2019t see, it can be a sign that something\u2019s wrong. Would you be willing to get checked out by a doctor, and tell them what you\u2019re experiencing?\u201d \n\nIf he gets defensive, or worried that you think he\u2019s \u201ccrazy,\u201d refer back to the feelings he shared. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not calling you crazy, I\u2019m not qualified to decide that. But seeing these things is making you feel [scared][anxious][unsettled][like you can\u2019t trust your senses], and I think it\u2019s worth exploring whether someone with the right training can help you feel less [whatever bad feeling he names] about this. Or rule out something even more scary, like a brain tumor. If I could help you find a doctor or counselor, would you agree to go at least once and tell them what you\u2019ve told me?\u201d \n\nBe gentle, nonjudgmental, curious. \u201cIf there is something that might explain all this, aren\u2019t you curious to know?\u201d \n\nGood luck. You are being a good friend. \ud83d\udc99", "Maybe put some distance between the two of you. He\u2019s either a bad liar, a bad joker, or very delusional.
