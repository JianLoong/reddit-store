Seriously would you like to be treated like that if you flew out to see her?", "Yes, for the love of god, lick her up at the airport and bring roses.", "LOL schnucks. I love stl. Went to college there. And a few of my friends have been harassed on the metro\u2026 cmon bud", "I didn\u2019t understand that from your post, so I\u2019ll take back some of what I said. If it were me, I\u2019d want my BF to pick me up, but I have anxiety about airports too. If she\u2019s that familiar with the airport, I\u2019d just talk to her and be honest about it. But be willing to pick her up if she requests it.", "I\u2019ve been harassed on that Birmingham train line, and I\u2019ve been followed off the tube more than once. I still wouldn\u2019t call either of them unsafe for women - I travel a lot for work and the vast majority of my journeys are uneventful. But I definitely keep my wits about me, especially at night, because while they\u2019re not unsafe, they\u2019re also not completely safe in my experience.", "I think the tube is just crazy safe. I love it so much and I have absolutely no fears using it at any time of the day or night. Similar with the metro in Paris - clean, well-lit, just\u2026nice. \n\nAnd then I went to visit New York and took the subway, and I\u2019ve never hung on tighter to my partner. It\u2019s got a weird murdery vibe.", "Sounds like a good adventure. I've felt very safe on London area train/tube/bus transportation. Staff are great.\n\nDon't mean to suggest that I've never felt uncomfortable or experienced or seen some weird or concerning situations on public transportation but that can happen on the street, in stores, etc.", "Awww. That's really sweet.", "Yes!!! We always bring the dogs to pick each other up after work trips! It's the best to see their eyes light up when they spot you! And the kisses!! \u2764\ufe0f  okay gotta go kiss my pups now.", "Can you imagine if they were just thinking what an inconvenience.  My heart breaks for this girlfriend", "I feel like salty snacks are somehow extra good after travelling.", "Lol, I use the light rail to get to BWI all the time. I wouldn't ask my wife to ride it alone either \ud83e\udd23", "Exactly! I lived in Atlanta and have taken the Metro there and it was extremely stressful after a flight. I would be so freakin pissed if my boyfriend even asked me to do this!", "Yeah that sounds like my ex who \"forgot\" he had to pick up me and his MOM from the airport from a long flight from texas to VA. I was crying my eyes out while his MOM thought it was normal for him to forget us.", "This particular person is unhinged, they are all over this post having an actual fit over a thought a guy asked about. Yikes, dude.", "I get it. You are like OP and really have no compassion towards your loved one. It makes sense. Its ok that you are clueless how people work. Treat others how you want to be treated.", "And I said that he is an AH for what he even asked. So I stand by what I said!", "Think you need to get therapy, the way you're all over this post screeching at this dude, seek help. Have a great day.", "No no - go to Schucks and buy some doughnuts! \n\nAnd then ship the doughnuts to me.\n\n(Schnucks doughnuts is #3 thing I miss most about living in The Lou)", "Check edit", "That was pretty much what my original question was. That NY experience must have been weird.", "It was an amazing few days, I saw one of my favourite bands live 2 nights in a row, then visited friends for a couple of days before heading home and falling on my face for three days.", "This is the sweetest thing I have read all day! And it was a very bad day\u2026thank you \ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah, quickly getting that picture", "Yikes indeed. You must be his girlfriend.", "So people cant literally tell him he's the AH and for what reason???", "k thanks!", "They\u2019ve done down hill the last few years.  Used to get them for my kids 1-2 a month, not anymore", "Hope tomorrow is better!!", "World\u2019s Fair still kicking"]}
