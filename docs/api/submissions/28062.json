He had some depression and anxiety issues, which led to me moving out during the pandemic.\n\nI tried to develop more interests and stay active at that time, which included working out. I befriended my personal trainer, and after a year or so, she began to include me in her social circle.\n\nFor the last few years, I became healthier, came out of my shell, caught up on fun activities like dancing, meeting people, etc. Today, I am in very good shape, have a variety of friends, and sometimes get mistaken for being in my 30s.\n\nMy question comes from the fact that my son occasionally stays over at my apartment, even though he's in residence at college, and more often visits his father at the house.\n\nThe issue is that my lifestyle has changed since we all lived in the same home.\n\nAmong other things, I am busier, wear more flattering or \"active\" clothes, drink socially or will try pot with friends, and date casually.\n\nThese activities have caused awkwardness with my son, even though he will not have a direct conversation about it.\n\nMost recently, he showed up intending to spend the weekend at my apartment. This was a surprise, as my friend was already there hanging out with me. \n\nBecause my friend is a 26 year-old guy, it led to a tense conversation about whether we can have \"normal\" visits anymore.\n\nI said that no one should decide what's \"normal\" for me, including my son, and asked him how we could make the situation better.\n\nHe refused to explain his feelings or make any suggestions, stormed off, and has been radio silent since then.\n\nI wonder if anyone has dealt with similar situations? I feel happier, healthier, and more confident than I have in many years.\n\nWhat is there to do if this becomes \"upsetting\" for my adult child, especially when my attempts to talk about it are met with anger and silence.  Have I done something wrong, aka, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696253026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xwkaa/aita_because_my_son_is_uncomfortable_with_my/", "score": 2049, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems like on purpose", "On the one hand, I see your point that you deserve to be happy and if your son is going to drop in unannounced he\u2019s going to have to deal with surprises he finds. \n\nHowever, I think you\u2019re leaving out a lot of context. You didn\u2019t specify when exactly you moved out, just that it was \u201ca few years ago\u201d \u2014 how old was your son when you left? What was going on with him emotionally during that time? If your husband was struggling with his mental health then why did he retain custody of your son? Did you consider taking your son with you or did you leave them both? Did your son have to put in a lot of his own emotional resources to help his dad through the separation? How often did you see him when the separation was new and he was a teenager and how clearly did you express that you\u2019re happier on your own than you were with them?\n\nIf I had to guess, your adult son is not mad that you are currently having fun being single. Your teenage son is still resentful that you abandoned him and he had to take care of his dad. For that reason YTA because you don\u2019t seem concerned about your son\u2019s emotional state at all.", ">My husband works in engineering and was a generally level-headed person. He had some depression and anxiety issues, which led to me moving out during the pandemic.\n\nMaybe that is what your son is upset about.\n\nNow perhaps you left a ton out because you didn't think it was relevant to the issue, but I read that and thought \"holy fuck that's cold.\"   The whole 'in sickness and in health' thing...", "YTA. If a father in his 40s was hanging out with girls in their 20\u2019s and drinking, smoking weed, and hooking up. To the point his kids feel uncomfortable even being around his life, people would certainly demonize him. You sound more bothered that your son was even coming around at all. Like he should be off at college and leaving you alone. It sounds like your single freedom went to your head and you\u2019ve forgotten your not in your 20\u2019s. No one wants to see their mom acting like a college party girl and having casual relationships with dudes closer to their own age than hers. There is nothing wrong with dancing, smoking a bit of pot, and generally having fun in life. However, maybe you should start looking at developing relationships with people that are closer to your own age than your sons. \n\nBefore this, had you even been reaching out to your son to see how he is or spend any time with him? Have you and your husband made moves to reconcile or just divorce? This post reads like you\u2019re very self absorbed and have little time for anything but chasing your long gone youth", "YTA, it sounds like you're having a serious midlife crisis and it's pretty normal for a son to be weirded out by his mum partying with, taking drugs and fucking people half her age.\n\nHe's also probably pretty pissed off that it sounds like you fucked off the second his dad (your husband) had some kind of issues.", "Hard to give a judgment it can be a lot of things that make you or not that asshole.\n\n>He had some depression and anxiety issues, which led to me moving out during the pandemic.\n\nThis can be anywhere from my Husband had mental issues for decades and he made my life hell so I had to leave for my own safety to I left my husband at his worst because he didn't provide me with what I wanted. That you are justified or not, obviously your kid could have some issues with your decision. Did you have a good discussion with him as to why you had to separate and does he accept your decision?\n\n>I'm separated ... For the last few years\n\nYou have been separated for years? Is there a reason? Even if your husband make divorce hard, it should eventually get done. The separation without a divorce could give your kid the impression that there is still some chance of you being together with his dad.\n\nAs for your lifestyle making things awkward, well it depend on the specific again.\n\n>I am busier\n\nIs it hard for him to see you. Does being busier make him feel like he isn't a priority in your life anymore that he deserve less love? It's normal to have activities, plans, date, but not normal if 9 times out of 10 your kid can't see you because you drink, one night stand or party.\n\n>wear more flattering or \"active\" clothes\n\nGood looking clothes is nice, but not sure how I would feel if my 47yo mother would dress like a 20yo at a rave. We can't know if your son is overreacting or you are inappropriate.\n\n>drink socially or will try pot with friends\n\nDrink socially can mean take 1-2 light drinks during a dinner and maybe a bit buzzed on the weekend. Or it can mean take 2-3 hard drink several time per week and shit faced on the weekend.\n\n>Because my friend is a 26 year-old guy, it led to a tense conversation about whether we can have \"normal\" visits anymore.\n\nLet's be honest, your ''friend'' is closer in age to your son than you. No matter how open your son is, obviously he will be weird out by that. But hey I don't think you are necessary wrong for that. Your son came unannounced and you are free to casually date someone if you want. But the fact that he asked if he can have a normal visit make me believe that the drinking/casual dating is so frequent that one or the other happen most of the time he try to have time with you. And for that you would be an asshole.\n\nThis post could be just a mother that was in a bad marriage and trying to figure out her life while her son is uncomfortable with the changes but need to adapt. Or it could about someone that left her husband at his worst and started to heavily drink, smoke, wear inappropriate clothes and half the time her son come to visit he find her with a man almost as young as him.", "YTA You up and dropped your family during a global pandemic to go have fun. You left your son and husband who seem to have done nothing wrong but be sad, you're not even divorced officially. \n\nYeah I'd be pretty pissed at my mom if she abandoned me at 16 to go have fun and OCCASIONALLY see me on weekends, and then not even bother to make me comfortable. You don't even sound like you want your son around and he probably feels it.\n\nNevermind banging someone who's only 7 years older than your son and could be your son. I'd be wildly uncomfortable too.", "YTA - way too much info intentionally left out. It is pretty clear you felt suffocated by your marriage and now you are trying to recapture your lost 20s.\n\nYour son has picked up on this and is rightfully annoyed.", "YTA. Witnessing someone else's midlife crisis is uncomfortable when you're merely adjacent to them. The amount of secondhand embarrassment when it's your *parent* is paralyzing.", "YTA......look I don't care male or female.... if you date/sleep with someone closer to the age of your children then you can't be upset if your child calls you on your bullshit........how would you feel if your 19 year old son was running around with a 50 year old?  You probably wouldn't like it.", "what is more important to you?  sleeping with guys 15+ years younger than you?  or having a good relationship with your son?  its not that complicated, also not that hard to see how your son is a little uncomfortable with you sleeping with someone a few years older than him!", ">I said that no one should decide what's \"normal\" for me, including my son, and asked him how we could make the situation better.\n\nSo basically you are telling him \"let's talk about it but I don't care what you have to say because I will do whatever I want\".\n\nHe won't talk to you because you closed that door yourself. YTA", "YTA - You left your sick husband to bang guys barely older than your son. Of course he's not going to be comfortable with that.", "So just to be clear, you\u2019re not divorced and expect your son to be comfortable with someone in the home that is basically his age?\n\nYTA", "YTA.  I do not think it is normal to expect your 19 year old son to be comfortable visiting you while your 26 year old male friend is chilling with you. If you were divorced, it would be different.", "YTA. Your son is uncomfortable and embarrassed by your ridiculous behavior. You are embarrassing yourself \"chilling with 26 year old friend\", and your stupid partying.

That's just 20-something guys flattering you to get in your pants.", "Maybe you abandoning your husband during his time of need is the issue.", "Maybe he\u2019s uncomfortable with the idea that if he ever experiences depression and anxiety while in a relationship that she will leave him, just like his mother did to his father. And the title is bs, wording it like all the issues begin and end with your son being unable to to handle your post separation life. YTA because you dipped on your husband and son, who was still a kid at the time.", "YTA congrats you can be a party woman now, your son is so happy for you.", "Yta and creepy stop dating men not much older than your son", "You said your kid only visits occasionally because he\u2019s at college, and when he does he chooses to see his father more often.

Who was he living with during that time? Did you and your husband plan on trying to work on your issues in the relationship or was there an understanding that the separation was permanent? What about your husband's depression and anxiety made you want to leave the home?  \n\n\nI feel like there is just way too much missing information here to really give a good judgement. Your son is uncomfortable. That's pretty obvious and I think maybe you're being a little obtuse when you say you can't fix it when he won't communicate with you. I think anyone looking at the situation would think it was obvious. Your son is barely out of the nest and you've made all these changes in your life. He's already experiencing the massive change of moving away, but coupled with your seemingly complete change in personality, it must be jarring and upsetting. I'm not saying you're the bad guy for wanting to be happy and for working on self-improvement, but I think you need to ask yourself if you've sort of left your son in the dust here?", "Info: You claimed that it was due to depression and anxiety that you split from your husband. What exactly did that entail?\n\nAs it is right now, all of this strikes me as if you're going through a midlife crisis, and your son is weirded out by you hanging out with, partying with, doing drugs with, and potentially sleeping with people young enough to be your children.", "All I got was \n\n\u201cI abandoned my depressed and anxious husband during one of the MOST depressing and anxiety inducing moments in modern history to party and live life like a young adult and now my son thinks differently of me AITA\u201d\n\nI feel like if you read it like that, you might answer your own question.", "YTA.", "It\u2019s not the fitness, or the new clothes, it\u2019s the banging guys in their 20s because his dad who you\u2019re still married to started having mental health issues.

It was just uncomfortable and it wasnt \"normal\" visits anymore because once you add someone else it changes the dynamic. It wasnt a good relationship anymore because he rather spent his time with his girlfriend or he was too busy.\n\nBe less busy and spend time with your son.\n\nJust like your making time for your friends, make dates with your son.

My parents divorced when I was 18 and my first visit home from college I felt like my mother was a totally different person. Previously she did not drink, smoke, wore very typical soccer mom clothes, etc. \n\nWhen I returned home for the holiday she was wearing leather pants, occasionally smoking we\u2019d and drinking socially. She had a new group of friends who all wore leather and had Harleys. I was faced with two realities: one- feeling like it\u2019s great my mom is finally coming out of her shell and letting loose after being in a dying relationship for years and two- feeling like I didn\u2019t have a home anymore. I was happy for her as an adult, an individual, but my parents divorce and separation effected me, then going off to college being a huge shift and change in my life that took some time to adjust to. I was looking forward to coming home for the holidays and just one thing being the same, having my mom, being comforted and cared for. Only to come home and feel there was no place for me, I didn\u2019t know who my mother was anymore and frankly kind of just didn\u2019t know which way was up. (I feel differently now but looking back this is how I felt). I think it would have helped me if my mom was able to be empathetic to how so much change in such a short period of time might effect me and be able to be understanding as I worked through that. Frankly, as well as some boundaries for when I visited. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong but regardless it\u2019s hard on your kid already going through a really transitional time in their life. Maybe from time to time you can plan a day together to remind him his moms still there she\u2019s just also an individual who\u2019s taking care of herself and changing and that\u2019s okay. But a day where he can be reminded you\u2019re still there for him. And otherwise I think it\u2019s fair to say if he\u2019s going to show up unannounced he may be greeted with a sharp look into your updated lifestyle so if he isn\u2019t ready for that to give some notice or make sure your free. \n\nIf you can, allow him to talk about his feelings. I guess I wish my mom said \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s really strange to come home and everything\u2019s so different and your mom isn\u2019t exactly the same as you left her when you went away to school.

He had some depression and anxiety issues, which led to me moving out during the pandemic.  \nI tried to develop more interests and stay active at that time, which included working out. I befriended my personal trainer, and after a year or so, she began to include me in her social circle.  \nFor the last few years, I became healthier, came out of my shell, caught up on fun activities like dancing, meeting people, etc. Today, I am in very good shape, have a variety of friends, and sometimes get mistaken for being in my 30s.  \nMy question comes from the fact that my son occasionally stays over at my apartment, even though he's in residence at college, and more often visits my husband at the house.  \nThe issue is that my lifestyle has changed since we all lived in the same home.  \nAmong other things, I am busier, wear more flattering or \"active\" clothes, drink socially or will try pot with friends, and date casually.  \nThese activities have caused awkwardness with my son, even though he will not have a direct conversation about it.  \nMost recently, he showed up intending to spend the weekend at my apartment. This was a surprise, and my friend was already there hanging out with me.  \nBecause my friend is a 26 year-old guy, it led to a tense conversation about whether we can have \"normal\" visits anymore.  \nI said that no one should decide what's \"normal\" for me, including my son, and asked him how we could make the situation better.  \nHe refused to explain his feelings or make any suggestions, stormed off, and has been radio silent since then.  \nI wonder if anyone has dealt with similar situations? I feel happier, healthier, and more confident than I have in many years.  \nWhat is there to do if this becomes \"upsetting\" for my adult child, especially when my attempts to talk about it are met with anger and silence...  AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The changes that you've made in your life all sound healthy and appropriate for a woman who is and has been separated from their spouse for several years. Your son didn't bother to ask about coming to spend the weekend, because in his head, Mom is always just *there,* ready to spend time with him. Change is hard for people, but he needs to adjust to the new reality of your marriage with his father being over, just like you did. He doesn't have to like everything you do, but if he gave you the basic respect of calling first, he wouldn't have gotten his feelings hurt. \n\nConsider setting up regular times for just you and him to hang out 1on1, or 1 weekend a month for him to come stay over. Remind him that common courtesy asks us to call and check with people before showing up for the weekend. Unless of course, he wants you to just show up at his place unannounced to hang out. \n\nNTA. You are doing nothing wrong by having fun and hanging out with younger friends.", "NTA and there are so many comments in here that I strongly doubt these same people would be saying these things if you were a man hanging out with a much younger girl.\n\nEither case, I think you\u2019re doing great on working on your health, social life and other aspects that are directly connected to your happiness, such as making new friends, hanging out with new people, looking after your physique. It is very difficult for a lot of women above their 30s to feel empowered to do such things without feeling the judgement or social pressure of \u201cyou no longer have the age to do things like that\u201d. This might also be a cultural difference, but where I live, it is SO common to have women on their 40/50s going for night clubs with their younger work colleagues, going to the gym, and all that and I love the freedom that this mindset provides.\n\nWhat I think is that your son might have a hard time understanding these changes. To him, it\u2019s a whole different person, while for you might be just the same person just dedicating more time to your interests. For him is like, these hobbies, interests and passions never existed on you, and you\u2019re changing completely yknow? So might be hard for a 19 y/o to understand and absorb this new information without feeling like he is losing you (or at least what\u2019s familiar to him about you). \n\nI think its worth it to have an open dialogue with him, he\u2019s not a kid anymore, he\u2019s a 19 years old and have enough maturity to have a proper understanding of the world and humans. \nWishing you luck, hope it all sorts out and you get to be close to your son again!", " I'm on the fence here.

Still, it's a bit ick, and I can completely empathize with OP's son here. \n\n* That said, he showed up by surprise, so OP isn't rubbing it in his face or anything, that we know of. \n\nFrom all the above data points, plus OP ditching her husband over anxiety my gut feeling is that the son is definitely not an AH, but did have an awkward moment (OP better not ever complain about the spontaneous visits ending because if he keeps coming around he's going to be booking it in the calendar now). \n\nOP *might* be an AH, but my judgement would really require details and nuance that we don't have here. A little bit of ick and a somewhat callous statement about why hubby got dumped just isn't enough for me to take a position.

This is directly judging his mother and she has a right to check him on that. Which she did (told him he doesn't get to define what normal is for her). OP then asked him about what arrangements can they do moving forward so that he is comfortable in her apartment. And he decided to storm off. What can OP do if the son doesn't want to communicate?

He expressed discomfort and despite him directly offending her, she asked him how could they make his visits more comfortable moving forward. The son declined the chance to communicate and left. And now she's here asking if she's in the wrong for living her life the way she likes. Would she be doing that if she didn't care? Matter of perspective but I see nothing here to say she doesn't care about her son. \n\nIt's clear she doesn't care about her ex-husband. And that's fine. She doesn't have to care if she doesn't feel it. It being during the pandemic doesn't change anything for me. In fact it makes sense, since spending much more time together than previously might have made the need to leave the marriage a lot more apparent and unavoidable for OP. Who says she shouldn't have left because there was a pandemic? She didn't love the man, she didn't want to support him in whatever mental health struggles he was having. She was a crappy partner to him, what best than to leave if she didn't have the necessary love to be a good one? \n\nTheir separation surely was hard on the son.

Hell, if the mom was still the one that bailed, and THEN the dad started fucking 20-somethings, the comments would still be savage.  \n\n\nPretty obvious OP left to go fuck around.  That's her call to make.  But leaving your minor (at that time) child to deal with your depressed spouse during a pandemic so you can go fuck around?  There's no realistic way for that not to be asshole behavior.", "My favorite part in all this?\n\nThe comments that argue that OP just \"woke up, realized she didn't want to be married any more, and just moved on. What's wrong with that\"? The husband isn't getting the same grace/excuses even though he's the one who stayed for their son and likely wouldn't if we flipped the script that dad stepped out on his depressed wife during COVID and now his 19 year old daughter doesn't want to be around watching him sleep with 26 year old women.\n\nAs if her son wouldn't be perturbed to see how quickly his mom dumped the family unit to \"find herself\", and he is likely now questioning his idea of what makes a relationship with her worth all this hassle.", "Did you get so angry at the first sentence you didn't read the next one?", "Uh, people do it literally every day.  \n\n\nMaybe you don't actually understand the definition of the words \"can\" and \"can't\"?", "Apparently anyone who gives a kid up for adoption is a sociopath", "Her moving out isn\u2019t abandoning him. If she\u2019s out having fun while he\u2019s in college I don\u2019t see the problem with that.", "Did she leave her son? That\u2019s not clear. She left her spouse, and doesn\u2019t go into the full relationship history, but clearly there is one that made staying untenable for her. The pandemic exposed the cracks in lots of relationships.", "Keep in mind depression and anxiety could have just been him expecting her to wear a mask and stay inside. Lord knows my anti-mask mother thought I was being paranoid and anxious and controlling. (Jokes on her. COVID killed her. I survived my bout with it.)", "Let's just hope for his sake she wasn't hitting on his high school friends.", "I've heard way too many stories like this to trust people who talk like OP is talking about the early days. I'm sorry you went through that.", "You forgot about the part where she's still married! She just wants this opportunity to cheat with no consequences and then when she get her feelings hurt, she'll go running back to her husband demanding he take her back and forgive her.", "Depression is not something every partner can shoulder on... I don't know the specifics. I just know that if either of my parents dated someone who could be their kid (age wise) i would probably cut all contact", "What was it?", "What was it?", "I was referring to showing up to moms place with a 26 year old chad ready to bag mom, was there something else written?", "She's an asshole for choosing to live her life at the expense of her child's happiness. She left her family to fuck younger guys, which is pretty shifty. Would be just as shifty if dad left his family for a hot 20 something.", "My dad always says that the only thing he ***has*** to do is die, I find that quite freeing. Everything is a choice.", "Jesus. Way to take my comment out of context. Becoming unexpectedly pregnant and giving that child up for adoption is very different than deciding you no longer want to parent a child you choose to conceive, who you have raised since birth, and who believes is the recipient of your unconditional love.", "She left before he went to college. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but you\u2019ll never convince me that leaving your teenage child who is still at school, in the midst of a pandemic, to focus on yourself and sleep with people who could actually be your child - is some good thing.", "He was a minor when she left.", "Its clear that she left him at home with someone she couldnt bear to be with, so, that sounds a bit abandony.", "I mean, he was a teenager still at school - she now sees him \u201coccasionally\u201d at the weekend, and is clearly mildly annoyed that his presence gets in the way of sleeping with guys in their twenties. \n\nShe\u2019s hardly mother of the year mate.", "This is what he was probably meaning by normal. It's probably very uncomfortable for him that his mom is hooking up with a dude that was 7 years old when she gave birth to her son. He maybe asking how do you expect him to forget that you're tapping someone so close to his age. This is why I have always had a 10 year range either direction. If I were to hook up with someone they can't be more than 10 years younger cause it starts getting closer to my kids ages and 10 years older starts going closer to my parents ages. Both are weird to me. My parents were 19 and 24 when I was born and husband and I were 22 and 23 when when our first was born.", "If you can't support your partner through a period of depression then you shouldn't marry them. Wedding vows are meant to be taken seriously", "Don't make blanket statements and I won't take you out of context", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she left her teenage child to party. It sounds like she left her *marriage* to be healthy and happy. If she stayed nearby and kept her new home and her attention properly available to her kid, she didn\u2019t leave him. She hasn\u2019t really described the coparenting arrangements for when kiddo was still living with parents full time.", "He\u2019s a college student living on campus who comes home when he wants, and apparently can choose either of his parents\u2019 homes. Anecdotally, I went to college and didn\u2019t see my parents for months, and we had a great relationship. My own kids are young adults who live with me but they very much have their own lives so I just expect them to order their own comings and goings.\n\nThe issue is not that kiddo gets on her way, but that he seems to be editorializing about the fact that OP has moved on from her marriage, emotionally and socially, and is living like a single woman."]}
