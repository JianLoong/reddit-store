My fianc\u00e9e and I have had a fairly long engagement period primarily to save for our wedding and to get our dream venue. Our venue has a long waiting list, and when we were finally able to book we had to pay a pretty steep non-refundable deposit. \n\nMy family (father, stepmother, and 17 year old stepsister, who I\u2019ll call Jane) have known about our wedding date from the moment we finally booked it. My stepsister and I are really close. She was 4 and I was 13 when our parents got married. I\u2019ve never really viewed her as just my stepsister, but as my actual little sister.\n\nNow, Jane has a gift for music. She has played the piano since she was 5, and plans on studying music. I\u2019ve always supported Jane in this. About two weeks ago she was notified that she had been selected for a truly incredible opportunity regarding her music. I don\u2019t want to say what it is for the sake of privacy, but it really is huge. The issue? It conflicts with my wedding.\n\nMy stepmother (who, for reference, I have never gotten along with) contacted me with the news. I told her to congratulate Jane for me, and said that while I\u2019ll be extremely sad about her missing the wedding, I understand her taking this opportunity completely and I\u2019m happy for her. My stepmother then freaked out at me asking why I wasn\u2019t just going to change the date. I explained that getting our venue had taken us a long time, and we\u2019d already paid a very hefty deposit of several thousand dollars. Changing it was probably not going to be able to happen unless we changed our venue and took the financial loss. My stepmother continued to yell at me about valuing family over money, and I told her I would look into the venue\u2019s policy on changing the date.\n\nI can\u2019t reschedule it. I checked. I met up with Jane on the weekend and explained it to her. Jane told me she understood and was willing to skip her opportunity to be there. I told her she didn\u2019t have to do that, but she said she would be far more upset missing my wedding than her music thing. We hugged it out, and I told her I\u2019d make it up to her. I thought that was that.\n\nIt was not. Last night my stepmother called me and called me all sorts of horrific things including slurs (for reference, I am a lesbian) and said that I was just being nasty to Jane because I don\u2019t think of her as my real sister. She informed me that she, my father, and Jane will not be attending my wedding. I texted Jane who assured me she really was okay with what we\u2019d discussed and she had no idea her mom had called me. My dad says I should just suck it up and change the date so I don\u2019t upset my stepmother more. I don\u2019t know what to do. If I could change it, I would. My fianc\u00e9e has been on my side the whole time, agreeing she does NOT want to change it. \n\nAITA?? I feel like maybe I\u2019m being selfish here by choosing to keep my dream venue and not lose the deposit.", "created_utc": 1683677341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13daprz/aita_for_not_changing_my_wedding_date/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For me that would be a relationship ender.", "Jane is 17 years old (if I did my math right), old enough to decide what she wants. Personally, if the opportunity is that huge, I would encourage her to take it. Musical opportunities don\u2019t come by every day. \n\nThat being said, you are NTA for not being willing to lose thousands of dollars to appease your stepmonster. If she wants you to change the date so bad, *she* can pay you back the deposit you\u2019d lose (and only if you\u2019re willing to change the date.)\n\nYour dad needs to stop letting his wife mistreat his daughter.", "NTA.\n\nYou told Jane she could miss it to pursue her opportunity.  Your wedding date was set months ago.  Your step mom is being a raging AH", "Hmm step mother used slurs to yell at you for her daughter's decision. I don't think you want her there anyway.\n\nYour sister is old enough to make her own decisions\n\nNta", "NTA, but your stepmother is, big time! The solution is simple: stepmom takes her daughter to the once-in-a-lifetime musical opportunity and they participate as possible via videoconference. Dad attends your wedding and participates in daughter\u2019s musical competition by videoconference as possible. Done and done. I would push your sister harder to attend her opportunity if it really is that big a deal.", "NTA, and I feel like as long as you and Jane (who's old enough to make a decision like this) reach an understanding, it's none of your stepmother's business (especially after she used slurs. yikes.)", "You are 100% NTA and you need to tell Jane to take that opportunity. I feel like her mother is using her to be nasty to you. And how dare she say \u201cyou don\u2019t value family\u201d. I mean if you were an a-hole (which your not), couldn\u2019t you have applied that same logic to Jane taking the opportunity and not going to your wedding? But you didn\u2019t. You supported her. And if your father wants you to change it so bad then he can pony up the money for a new venue and pay your back all you\u2019ve lost. I would never expect anyone, especially a sibling, to change their wedding date that they have planned forever for me.\nEdit to add, part of me wonders if stepmom is going to blame Jane not taking the opportunity on you. Because they said the Weren\u2019t gong to the wedding now, yet it sounds like Jane is still not going to the music thing? Does maybe stepmom not want her to and is trying to use you as a reason? Maybe hoped this would all go down like this? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fmaybe far fetched, but please encourage your sister to take the opportunity that likely won\u2019t come up again.", " Is Stepmom willing to reimburse you for the cost of the deposit on the venue.

You are not going to be able to attend everything or change dates on things, especially life charging events. You told her sister that she didn't have to attend and that you wished her luck on her event. She weighed her options and chose your wedding. Step mom should understand this and shut her AH mouth. Congratulations on the nuptials.", "NTA. So, I\u2019m sure your stepmother must\u2019ve offered to pay the cancellation fee? Of course not. Honestly, this would be a dealbreaker for my Dad \u2026 I\u2019d never talk to him again.", "NTA. By stepmother's logic, I'd argue that since your date and venue were booked first, Jane should forgo this music opportunity if she wants to be at the wedding - which she did offer to do. You checked into trying to change the date - you can't. You're ok with going ahead without Jane so Jane can pursue this opportunity. Jane is ok with missing the wedding. It's really none of stepmother's business. But the way she's acting, it sounds like she should be missing the wedding, too.", "NTA: Since they value family over money, have you asked them to put their money where there mouth is and pony up the money it will cost you to change the date?", "NTA. Your stepmother is acting wildly entitled over your wedding. Your sister can't make it - ok, that sucks, but where I come from, the wedding date only changes if the bride or groom can't make it (or nearly only in those cases).\n\nAlso, your dad is a big AH for suggesting you should \"just suck it up\" and change your wedding date to avoid upsetting his wife more. Dude, seriously?", "NTA. What\u2019s important is you talked to Jane about it. You were more than happy for Jane to go to her thing (I imagine an audition or something) instead of your wedding, and Jane told you she\u2019s more than happy to miss it to go to your wedding. Your stepmom is causing drama for no reason and your dad is probably just sick of hearing about it. Keep the date and the venue. Maybe set it up for Jane to get a ride to attend if needed but overall keep communication open with Jane. She\u2019s what\u2019s important in this issue.", "NTA - It is so obvious, that I think this story is made up.", "NTA but please password protect your wedding stuff so the stepmom can\u2019t change any of the details.", "NTA.\n\nJane is OK with things. Keep your date, keep your venue.", "NTA. I'm assuming that Jane is a product of your dad and step mom? Step mom sounds like a real piece of work. I don't think you should cave into her, especially if she's being homophobic to you. Jane seems to love you and is honestly seems to be a pretty good sister given what her mom is like. She's okay with it and that's all that really matters", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That way you aren\u2019t losing anything financially but since they want the date to change they should be the ones held financially responsible. If they aren\u2019t willing to pay the non refundable deposit then you tell them that this is you and your wife\u2019s dream venue and that based on the venues policy we cannot change the date. I still think that you could ask for them to foot the non refundable or at least 40-50% of it because then you aren\u2019t at a total financial loss and since they want you to change the date they should pay. If you do end up doing this let me know how it goes and congratulations on the wedding that\u2019s a huge step and I\u2019m sorry you have a homophobic SM.", "Op first NTA at all.\n\n Tell Jane to take the opportunity and you, your wife and Jane go celebrate together your wedding, show her the video etc on another date.\n\nThis has the added advantage beside Jane going to her event of getting rid of the toxic waste of her mother and sorry to say your dad allowing you to have a peaceful happy wedding."]}
