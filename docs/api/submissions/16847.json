My fianc\u00e9e and I have had a fairly long engagement period primarily to save for our wedding and to get our dream venue. Our venue has a long waiting list, and when we were finally able to book we had to pay a pretty steep non-refundable deposit. \n\nMy family (father, stepmother, and 17 year old stepsister, who I\u2019ll call Jane) have known about our wedding date from the moment we finally booked it. My stepsister and I are really close. She was 4 and I was 13 when our parents got married. I\u2019ve never really viewed her as just my stepsister, but as my actual little sister.\n\nNow, Jane has a gift for music. She has played the piano since she was 5, and plans on studying music. I\u2019ve always supported Jane in this. About two weeks ago she was notified that she had been selected for a truly incredible opportunity regarding her music. I don\u2019t want to say what it is for the sake of privacy, but it really is huge. The issue? It conflicts with my wedding.\n\nMy stepmother (who, for reference, I have never gotten along with) contacted me with the news. I told her to congratulate Jane for me, and said that while I\u2019ll be extremely sad about her missing the wedding, I understand her taking this opportunity completely and I\u2019m happy for her. My stepmother then freaked out at me asking why I wasn\u2019t just going to change the date. I explained that getting our venue had taken us a long time, and we\u2019d already paid a very hefty deposit of several thousand dollars. Changing it was probably not going to be able to happen unless we changed our venue and took the financial loss. My stepmother continued to yell at me about valuing family over money, and I told her I would look into the venue\u2019s policy on changing the date.\n\nI can\u2019t reschedule it. I checked. I met up with Jane on the weekend and explained it to her. Jane told me she understood and was willing to skip her opportunity to be there. I told her she didn\u2019t have to do that, but she said she would be far more upset missing my wedding than her music thing. We hugged it out, and I told her I\u2019d make it up to her. I thought that was that.\n\nIt was not. Last night my stepmother called me and called me all sorts of horrific things including slurs (for reference, I am a lesbian) and said that I was just being nasty to Jane because I don\u2019t think of her as my real sister. She informed me that she, my father, and Jane will not be attending my wedding. I texted Jane who assured me she really was okay with what we\u2019d discussed and she had no idea her mom had called me. My dad says I should just suck it up and change the date so I don\u2019t upset my stepmother more. I don\u2019t know what to do. If I could change it, I would. My fianc\u00e9e has been on my side the whole time, agreeing she does NOT want to change it. \n\nAITA??

I would never expect anyone, especially a sibling, to change their wedding date that they have planned forever for me.\nEdit to add, part of me wonders if stepmom is going to blame Jane not taking the opportunity on you. Because they said the Weren\u2019t gong to the wedding now, yet it sounds like Jane is still not going to the music thing? Does maybe stepmom not want her to and is trying to use you as a reason?

I\u2019m not kidding. Make sure everything is ironclad, so your stepmother can\u2019t do a last minute sabotage, and cancel things while pretending to be you. Hide your dress/suit somewhere - remove it from your home if your dad or Jane have a key. If you trust your fianc\u00e9s family, that\u2019s a great spot - speaking as one, future SILs make great guard dogs. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen, but your step mom seems a little unhinged, so I\u2019d cover all my bases. \n\nDespite all this drama, I hope you have a lovely wedding, at your gorgeous venue, with your beautiful fianc\u00e9 and loving little sister.", "NTA.\n\nBut if changing the date is so important to your stepmonster, give her and your father the opportunity to reimburse you and for rebooking a venue.

When that didn\u2019t work for her, she decided no one would attend, keeping Jane free to do the music opportunity. If she didn\u2019t want Jane to do the music thing and wanted to hold it over OP, she could\u2019ve just done nothing until after the wedding and then talked about it the rest of her life", "NTA. I would not only ask her/your dad to pay, but also flip that whole cursed script back at her. She thinks this is because Jane is technically your stepsister? ::insert WRONG buzzer:: Incorrect! But maybe she's only reacting like this because you're not her bio daughter? Or because you're a lesbian? Or because she never wanted to go to the wedding to begin with and this is the excuse she's been waiting for? Because the immediate and intensely negative reaction--complete with homophobic slurs!--that lacked all thought towards the very reasonable fact that venues are difficult to book and difficult to change seems vehement enough to suggest she's been dying to throw a fit about *something* this whole time. She didn't calmly try to brainstorm fixes; she went full throttle immediately and tried to dress it up as indignation for her bio daughter, who is completely fine with this.\n\nAnd I would insist on answers to those questions to. They're not rhetorical, not for her."]}
