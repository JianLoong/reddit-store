He was def looking for a reaction and that is sexual harassment and needs to be dealt with before it turns into something much worse", "NTA\n\nHe fucked around and found out.", "NTA. He\u2019s the AH and if this affects his graduation that\u2019s entirely his fault.", "NTA. It was an \"accident\", then it was a \"joke\", maybe some day it will be \"20 minutes of action\". Better for him to have consequences now than to end up like Brock Turner (or whatever his name is these days, I forget, so please enlighten me).", "NTA. He chose to send you the link, so he should deal with the repercussions of that choice. If he was laughing, then it doesn\u2019t seem to be as much of an accident as he said it was.", "NTA. \n\nhe might have cost HIMSELF graduating by doing that.", "NTA. \n\nHe was using class time to harass you. It wasn\u2019t an accident. It wasn\u2019t a joke. He was trying to embarrass you and make you uncomfortable. He succeeded in wasting your time and costing you actual educational content. \n\nHe\u2019s not risking his graduation on this one thing, I\u2019d it\u2019s causing him problems for graduating, he was on super thin ice already. You have very little to do with it. He\u2019s made choices. \n\nHe was working hard to avoid learning, but it sounds like education is coming for him anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou have nothing to feel bad about. You don't need to feel like you are overreacting. I think your actions have been very reasonable\n\nHis comment about you not being able to take a joke makes it obvious that it was not an accident\n\nAn accident would be a bit of a different convo, but him doing it on purpose is definitely sexual harassment. You are not responsible for whether he graduates or not. His actions. His consequences. Try not to lose any sleep over it\n\nIf he continues trying to interact with you, tell the school you do not want him to be allowed near you. Tell them you are willing to get a restraining order if they can't take care of it", "NTA. Which was it - a joke or an accident? If a joke, it was inappropriate and not funny. If an accident, how? Why was he copying porn links while in a virtual class? And why would you want to risk being assigned to work with someone who, at best, is messing around with porn during class? Frankly, the fact that he was laughing immediately after the incident and later asked \u2018can\u2019t you take a joke?\u2019 **strongly** suggests to me that it was absolutely not an accident, it absolutely *was* sexual harassment, and any problems he has arising from it are entirely of his own creation. Also consider that you showed the professor your screen (which presumably included the \u2018it was an accident\u2019 message) and the university investigated. They clearly believe you were right to report this.", "NTA. Maybe if he concentrated more on evil instead of being a skeezy creepy perv, he wouldn't be struggling with school. What a total loser", "NTA like what the heck? A) if someone accidentally put porn link on zoom they usually would profusely apologize. B) why in the world he has porn link on his clipboard available during the class? Ew", "NTA. If he can\u2019t graduate, that\u2019s on him, do not feel bad. Actions have consequences. You\u2019d figure he\u2019d learn that before college.", "NTA. You did exactly what one should do in that situation. And what a dumbass, anyone with an ounce of sense who was at risk of not graduating should be on their absolute best behavior and focused on their work.", "Inappropriate, creepy and I'm also surprised of how obnoxious that was. He somehow decided that sending such thing to a total stranger in the context of a class was funny... How... What.... Just.... No.\n\nNTA", "NTA - He knew exactly what he was doing and when called out fell back on the refrain of the asshole - \"it was just a joke.\"\n\nNope, not a joke. Actions, meet consequences. Maybe he'll think twice next time.", "NTA - his problem. He gets to deal with the consequences of his actions. Don\u2019t let him blame you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA- saying you can't take a joke, is further harassment and should be reported.\n\nBecause I think he was told to leave you alone.  He didn't.  And it should be documented because you never know what someone might do.", "NTA. This is sexual harassment and should not be tolerated on any campus. People with this type of behavior usually continue this behavior and it is very likely they have done this to someone before or would have done it again. Good on ur professor for taking this seriously. He deserves to get in trouble that\u2019s why the consequences are put in place. Title IX protects you. I am sure you have done the course but you should really look at what it is and what your rights as a student are.", "NTA. A joke only a joke if everyone laughs.
