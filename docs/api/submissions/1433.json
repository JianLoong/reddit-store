Molly also won't be coming on the trip because she isn't the going out/partying/clubbing type, and will most likely either visit family or enjoy the quiet in her own house\n\n&#x200B;\n\nainslea, however, is really bad at budgeting her money. she almost always has a $0-$3 balance in her bank account, and she owes molly over $200 for a vacation almost a year ago, and owes me close to $60 for tickets, drinks, ubers, etc. She somehow has money for fast food occasionally, as well as vapes that she buys instead of paying us back. Every time we go out to bars she either begs/guilts us to let her borrow money, saying she' \"pay us back\", but rarely does, or will go out sober, then beg us to lend her money for drinks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that while nicole and i are on spring break, we will both be 21 and have our own money. The odds that ainslea will be able to save enough to spend/ cover her portion of the trip (just her plane ticket, her portion of the hotel, and her alcohol/food) are extremely slim. On top of that, ainslea also won't be 21 by spring break (june birthday). She has a fake ID that is  garbage, and ainslea refuses to buy a new one or buy someone else's real ID. I know that nicole and i are looking forward to going to real bars after years of partying at \"freshman\" bars, and there's no way we would be able to take her, meaning that we'll either end up having to leave or not go at all to make sure she still has a good time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like i'd be an asshole for only going on this trip with just nicole and the mutual friends outside our immediate friend group, because ainslea would absolutely love to do something fun for spring break, especially since it would be almost all of our friend group (3 of the 4 of us) Personally, i don't want to have to worry about her and paying for her, and i know nicole doesn't either. I'm worried that if ainslea did get enough money to pay for her hotel and flight, that she would run out of money halfway through the trip, and rely on myself, nicole, or the other girls to cover for her. ainslea doesn't know we've made these plans yet, and nicole and i really don't want to tell her until its too late for her to book anything to avoid hurting my one of my best friends feelings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith spring break being such a big investment and expensive trip, her \"borrowing\" money from us is a lot more serious, so Would I Be The Asshole for not inviting ainslea on the spring break trip because of her money issues?", "created_utc": 1667605172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yme384/wibta_for_not_inviting_one_of_my_best_friends_on/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Expect her to fight and blame you over it.  \n\nIMO even if you invite her and she somehow manages to get funds for it, she shouldn't be booking flights and hotels with you. She should first be paying the amount she owes you and Nicole. Make sure you are firm on it. \nYou should never lend money to your friends or family unless you have enough and are okay with never getting it back. Make sure you let her know you don't want to give her any more money for spring trip or otherwise and stick to the boundary no matter how much she begs.", "Invite her and if she runs out of money don't pay for any of her expenses if she comes.", "Nta, someone who asks you for money that frequently doesn't care about you.

You're not obligated to invite anyone, and she's proven herself to be bad with money/expect others to pay for her.

That\u2019s it. It sounds like a dick statement, but it\u2019s true. And *you and Nicole should not have to financially carry anyone else* especially on Spring Break! There is no obligation to have to have all your friends with you 24/7 with every memory, as nice as it may be that they are. And you definitely don\u2019t owe it to anyone to switch up your own plans on your first big vacation as *an adult* because someone else refuses to compromise. \n\nHOWEVER, you are also sorely mistaken if you think Ainslea won\u2019t be offended or hurt if you tell her when it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m all for open and honest communication. \n\nThe best solution, which will also take the most amount of work, will be to invite Ainslea but explain to her that *under no circumstances* will anyone have the extra money to financially support her. If she attends the trip, the financial burden for herself is hers alone to carry and if she runs out of money, that is not anyone else\u2019s problem nor concern. If she wants to come, she pays her way. *BUT THEN YOU NEED TO STICK WITH THIS*!!! The reason she owes everyone so much money is because you guys keep *giving* her money. Set a boundary, put your foot down, and stop budging. \n\nThis way, the invite is extended, Ainslea isn\u2019t offended by being intentionally excluded without so much as a conversation as to why, and you guys don\u2019t shell out extra money.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nBut you need to tell her ahead of time that you're booking the trip or she's just going to go around telling everyone how cruel you were to exclude her.  Tell her you understand money is a concern for her and since she already owes you both money, you don't want her going into even more debt since this will be an expensive trip.  \n\nShe'll probably flip out and insist she can pay but STAND FIRM ON THIS.  At least if she goes around spewing BS about how you \"hurt\" her by excluding her, you can let everyone know about how she still owes you money.  Then she's put on notice with everyone that she's a leech.  Win-win.", "NTA, she still owes from last vacation and can\u2019t even partake in what y\u2019all want to do. It\u2019s not unreasonable to exclude someone who you a) know can\u2019t afford a trip b) know will pressure you to pay for things and won\u2019t pay you back.", "NTA - Go and have your fun. If she does find out and make a fuss remind her that she already owes both of you. Her reaction will say more about her than you.", "NTA.  An adults only trip. No fake ID drama, no running out of cash or forgetting your wallet. Just tell her \"next time\"  and two is better than three for what y'all want to do. Have fun. No debate allowed", "NTA\n\nShe needs to learn the she can't depend on friends to fund her lifestyle but budget and prioritize what is important.\n\nYou have to also grow up and realize that it is not your responsibility to fund your friends because they are irresponsible with money.\n\nI can't imagine feeling guilty for not providing more money to someone who is essentially a mooch.\n\nThis is not any kind of moral dilemma as she doesn't \\*need\\* to go on a vacation. This is a want and she just happened to \\*want\\* other things more whereas you and your friend really \\*wanted\\* the vacation and were wiling to sacrifice other fun stuff for the past year in order to save up.\n\nEnjoy the vacation without guilt.", "NTA-  book your tickets. \n\nAnd stop giving her money!  She is not going to learn to budget if you keep paying her way.", "This, NTA"]}
