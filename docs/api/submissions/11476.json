People like that - even fa,ily- take the things you work hard for for granted.", "NTA. You told him to keep the dog leashed sue to wildlife. He thought he knew better and now his dog has to suffer. Don\u2019t pay a dime but also don\u2019t let him stay at your house anymore. He can\u2019t follow instructions.", "NTA he\u2019s delusional", "NTA\n\nYou told him to keep his little dog on a leash.  It is a working farm with livestock and sometimes intruders.  \n\nI'm so glad your big dogs were there to try to protect the little dog", "Nta. Your bro should probably not have pets", "NTA. You specifically told him to put the dog on a leash when the dog was outside.  I live in the suburbs and we have coyotes in the area.  We also have hawks and I have a large barn owl that lives in two of my trees.  That big guy has thinned the squirrel population.  If I had a little dog, I wouldn\u2019t let it out alone.", "NTA you warned him and it is his responsibility to make sure his dog is safe. I live in a neighborhood but it\u2019s surrounded by farms and I see foxes and predatory birds as well all the time and just to be safe we always go out with the our dog because she\u2019s small.  I feel that\u2019s just common sense in the country and you told him so no I wouldn\u2019t be paying any part of that bill.", "Years ago we took our 6 month old German shepherd puppy to my uncles acreage in the middle of nowhere. We were advised to bring a kennel and not leave the dog unattended because they had RACCOONS bigger than our dog that could mess with her. You bet we brought a kennel and never let her out of our sight.\n\nDon\u2019t mess around with nature, it will teach you valuable (and expensive) lessons.", "Seriously. Go to a strange farm, follow the damn instructions. (Also works for anywhere you\u2019re not used to being, when getting advice from someone who knows the area. This reminds me of the women who begged her houseguests to not leave their laptops in their car; houseguests laughed at her, then wanted her to pay for the laptops after they got stolen)", "I thought coyotes only come out at night? At least that\u2019s when I hear them occasionally.", "There are coyotes in most cities too! We have a fully fenced yard ourselves and are comfortable with our dog in the back. Our cat we have a special enclosure for outside, but she is mostly inside only. We leash both of them when out (dog out of 6' fenced yard, cat out of enclosure). Yes there is a leash law, but there are regular small dogs and cats found ripped in half from coyotes or predatory birds. This is in the city... houses 10-20 feet apart, hospital, event center, etc. It would be even less safe in the country where there are little to no fences that will keep a coyote out. You have a small animal and you are responsible for keeping it safe.", "Also I missed the part where OP invited this dog. Oh wait, they didn't.", "I live in a big city and even then my family keeps our pets inside because urban predators do in fact exist for small dogs and cats. Foxes are opportunistic bastards.", "I'm so sorry.", "I've seen a couple mentions of fisher cats here and had to look them up. We're so far south that I've never lived in their territory. They look like they can be pretty vicious!", "I live in a city and I watch my little dog when I let her out because I've seen hawks circle directly above her and racoons have tried to come up behind her before (and cuz I don't have a backyard and I'm going out into my front yard with her off leash in a suburban area lmao) plus dogs and there's pretty much a gang of stray cats that'll attack people too", "they are opportunistic hunters, not necessary nocturnal", "A friend who lives in Alberta told me about watching a young coyote playing tag with his young dog. It looked really cute until he realized that the coyote was gradually getting the dog to chase it closer and closer to a low rise - behind which were very likely young coyote\u2019s hungry family. He called his dog back and left quickly. \n\nThat was in full day.", "I deadass saw a coyote cross a major street in Toronto in the middle of the afternoon... cars had to stop and everything. Thought it was a loose dog at first and tried to call it back to the sidewalk, but when it turned and looked at me, it was a \"nevermind, carry on, sir\" moment for me! In the years I lived there, I saw coyotes in broad daylight a couple more times, but they weren't as confident as that first one, for sure.", "Here in AZ i see them out in the day time pretty often.", "I live in the northeast too and I have neighbors who\u2019s dogs wear spike vests to protect them from hawks, coyotes and other stuff. There\u2019s a pack of wild turkeys that will harass small dogs too.", "Yeah, I forgot the alligators. It's a Florida thing too. And then there's snakes...", "I did too. Wikipedia said they can actually eat porcupines \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33", "We used to have a small number of stray cats (Neutered and Released) in our area, until coyotes moved in.  :(", "We had one stare us down \u201cyou ARE going to stop for me so I can cross, right?\u201d We did.", "You live in Cambridge?  I\u2019ve seen those coyotes too.  They just chill at night in places you would never expect.  But at least they are starting to eat the damn turkeys that are all over that city", "They take their meals to go.", "That\u2019s happened here, in my non-rural suburb. Lady was out walking her toy poodle and a coyote snatched it from right in front of her.", "I\u2019ve just never seen them. Seen foxes but not coyotes.", "I guess the ones we have just prefer to come out at night.", "They disappear from our area for 15 years. Now that they\u2019re back we moved up the time the cats have to be inside by during the summer.", "Wild turkeys are not to be messed with.", "San Diego, actually!", "Dude it isn't even just predators like coyotes. When I was in high school, my friend's cat was killed after getting into a fight with some particularly nasty raccoons. The raccoons kept attacking people's pets until animal control trapped and euthanized them, fearing rabies. They weren't rabid, just hyper aggressive.", "I\u2019m in SoCal and Coyotes out here are BRAZEN. They\u2019ll snatch dogs out of yards (anywhere honestly) and they get BIG?? I used to live in canyon county and I used to walk my 80lb German shepherd at like 2-3am when I couldn\u2019t sleep. We walked into a pack of coyotes nearly as big as her one night. She\u2019s feisty but gave me the \u201cNope hell nah\u201d look. We booked it back to our condo. Never went out alone with her after sundown again. Coyotes are fuckin menaces down here.", "I'm from the UK and we had a seagull take a chihuahua \ud83d\ude02", "I think they are just really capable when it comes to adapting their behaviours. If they've learned that there are good opportunities for food in the daytime, they'll do that! When I have lived in more rural areas, I've never seen them in the day... their food comes out at night when there's also no humans around, win/win. In the city, there's always humans and maybe more scavenging opportunities before the raccoons wake up, lol", "When we lived in sloth San Jose, there were always missing pet signs posted near Coyote Creek (you think the name would be a hint). My husband and I call them coyote chow posters."]}
