But you have no further responsibility in this, and your brother is only trying to place the blame on you because he's mad at himself for being negligent.", "NTA.

If he wants to play that game, he should be paying YOU for your dogs saving his dog\u2019s life", "You're both the asshole. Him for being a nitwit, and you for not protecting the nitwit's dog by shaking the nitwit until he understood that predatory wild animals frequent your property and would regard his small dog as an easy meal.\n\nYou warned him that there was wildlife (implied here to be risky wildlife) in the area but then when he says you should have known (and, of course, warned him) of the risk of a coyote attack, you say you had no way of knowing that would happen because you've had no experience of a small dog in the area being offleash.  This makes no sense. You were obviously aware there was a risk to a small dog from the wildlife, which includes coyotes.\n\nThe story as written strongly implies that he was assuming your admonition to leash the dog came from you wanting the dog not to foul your property. You repeated the warning and appeared to try to make it clearer that the concern was about the dog, not the property. It seems as if this was never really cleared up between the two of you.\n\nI think he's being somewhat unreasonable to hold you at fault for the attack, but I also think you're being unreasonable to reject any responsibility.  You did have specific knowledge of the sort of animals that live on your farm, and the likely risk they posed to a small dog alone. You did have a moral responsibility to make absolutely clear to the dog's owner that his dog was at high risk of being killed brutally by a wild animal if let wander around alone.", "Exactly. He's honestly lucky that a) OP's big boys were around and b) that it was a predator they could defend the little one *from*, and not something either dangerous to *all* of them like a wolf, or better able to escape like a hawk or owl.", "What makes me angry here, what makes the brother a real AH, is that while *he* fucked around, his *innocent dog* found out.\n\nOP is NTA.  Brother is a huge, raging AH who should not have a dog.", "If you bring your dog to someone else's place and your host tells you to keep it on a leash on the property, you need to listen. It doesn't really matter if the host was initially thinking more of the safety of the dog or, for example, the danger to her livestock posed by an untrained dog on the loose. NTA imo", "If those big dogs hadn't been there, it's likely the coyotes would have snatched the little one and run."]}
