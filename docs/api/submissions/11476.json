Yes there is a leash law, but there are regular small dogs and cats found ripped in half from coyotes or predatory birds. This is in the city... houses 10-20 feet apart, hospital, event center, etc. It would be even less safe in the country where there are little to no fences that will keep a coyote out.

The other reason was my parents had horses that attacked anything larger than a squirrel that came on to the property that they didn't know. Once, my little boy managed to bring down a hawk that went for him. How did I know? My sweet boy thought stuffing things *under my pillow* was a great way to gift me things. That was a great way to start the evening! Along with the few rabbits and a dozen moles over the years while staying with the parents.", "Exactly. My grandmother had a bunch of Jack Russells. She didn't let her dogs out without being out there with them, not necessarily all the time on a leash because they were trained well enough to come back when she called, but she had a hawk pick one of them up and carry it off at one point.
