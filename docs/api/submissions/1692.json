I\u2019m guessing her getting mad often has the same common theme of your actions make her feel like an after thought or that you don\u2019t consider her in even the small decisions you make.  It may not seem like a big deal or make sense to you but your wife may be feeling under appreciated or that you don\u2019t really think of her after the length of time you have been together. \n\nI would highly recommend looking at some relationship building books and even starting with the love languages to see how to best show her in a way she can understand that\u2019s your goal and also in a way that makes HER feel loved. Words, gifts, quality time, acts of service. These are some of them, to one person a kind word is worth it\u2019s weight in gold but to someone else a little toy that they live will be just as valuable or even grabbed you a burger when I stopped for coffee and decided I wanted one too.  \n\nJust thought of you and wanted to do something nice. Even if she didn\u2019t eat it and it got thrown away after 2weeks in fridge death it still will have that consideration love attached to it. \n\nThese are just some things to consider. Love isn\u2019t always practical or may not always make sense without all of the pieces but there may be a common theme when you write down. Wife mad about xyz and what she said she was mad about, then look at each thing and see if you can find a common theme of what behaviors tend to upset her and what they could actually be stemming from, not just the surface situation and not understanding and not looking deeper to try and work together to strengthen the relationship.", "I've read enough.

YTA", "Where is it illegal to be in a parking lot on your phone?", "Why didn't you just eat what was in the fridge too then?", "Nah, if you get food always get her something, ESPECIALLY if you actually ask her and she says she isn\u2019t hungry. Make your life a lot easier bud ;)", "You don't get to decide what your wife is in the mood to eat. The fact that the leftover pizza was there doesn't necessarily make it appealing, what's the harm in picking one up for her just in case? \n\nYTA", "My gf and I do this for each other. Guess we\u2019d rather be wasteful than have someone staring at us with the wish I had some face while eating.", "How would it have gone to waste? Just put it on the fridge for the next meal", "Holy COW!", "What about having it not touch you at all while saying \u201chey siri, call my wife\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of available technology that allows hands-free, really not an excuse", "You ate the burger while driving!?", "You rightfully say you can't touch your phone in your vehicle while the vehicle is running - as per the law in Australia.\n\nBut you're okay with driving one-handed to eat while you drive?", "Did you eat the burger before getting home?\n\nI see your reasoning", "You could have had one burger had the second in case she wanted it. Then if she didn't you're good to eat it, if she did, you can have the left over pizza", "Yeah.  YTA for leaving the restaurant without having consideration for household members.  If you had found your order messed up, you\u2019d have gotten back in line to fix it.  Priorities man.", "It's also perfectly reasonable to assume she didn't and she would also want a treat", "I didn't say you lie, I said half true because it is impossible to understand, such as why you were out why there is no food home etc. You may add more details or listen to my therapy or divorce advice.", "I think your fine. She was hangry.  And she's covertly training you by the way.  Good luck!", "Don't know about in Aussie law but UK if your vehicle engine is running its hands free or no call.", "I already covered all of this. I was AT the ordering window when I decided to get a burger. I could have put it in park and called, but then I most certainly would have been an arsehole to everyone waiting behind me. Plus everything else I said about being 2pm, having pizza, not being a special treat, etc, still applies.", "I can't remember but I'm sure that's what it was. A grand angus deluxe or whatever it is.", "Well, the laws vary. In any case, all other points stand.", "Australia, apparently. Americans in this thread be freaking out like other countries don't exist \ud83d\ude01", "Not that I can recall, but I normally ask first. I couldn't on this occasion, but was also quite sure she would have eaten her pizza by 2pm. She could have called any time to ask me to bring her some food.", "I didn't want a second burger. We were going out for an early dinner only 1.5 hours later.", "Many countries and states etc. I never EVER touch my phone while driving, including in drive through. Regardless, I didn't want to hold everyone up, but just didn't think my wife would want or need the burger.", "I wondered too.  It\u2019s private property, not the public street.  If this happened in the US, I don\u2019t yet believe it\u2019s illegal to touch the phone.", "She refuses to eat reheated burgers. And we were going away for two nights so there was no way to have  it for at least 48 hours.", "I got through half but it was too hard/messy to eat the rest so I finished it at home.", "But MORE reasonable to assume that someone who is at home and normally eats lunch 2-3 hours earlier, and has pizza at home, would have already eaten.", "If something is half true, it literally must be half a lie, so you did call me a liar.\n\nI'm not sure what extra detail you need. I was out. Why does the reason make any difference?", "OP would understand those nuances then, but if the line was as long as stated, they had time to shut the car off and make the call earlier in the line.", "Why couldn't you eat the pizza when you got home?  I doubt you would have starved on the drive.  The same reasons you said she didn't deserve a burger, apply to you as well.", "YTA not even for not getting your wife a burger but the fact that there was a long line and then you waited until the window to add to your order!  You and people like yourself are the reason for the long line ups and that\u2019s what makes you selfish and an asshole.", "Angus?? McDonalds discontinued the Angus burgers in 2013. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nETA - and they were $4.", "Bro, it's illegal to eat and drive in most Aussie states. Don't pretend to care about road rules when you just couldn't be bothered.", "but why eat a burger one handed while driving? doesnt that also seem dangerous", "That\u2019s for when you travel.  You were at home.  You\u2019re changing your justification.  Did the first one not work?", "It\u2019s very much illegal in many countries, just because it\u2019s ok in the us doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok everywhere in the world", "Oh OK, I get it then", "It\u2019s the gesture. If you are at a point of your marriage that you don\u2019t care to bring something to eat to your spouse after you bought something, then you don\u2019t care about giving them something nice.", "OK. You could have call when you decided to buy burger, before entering the line and when you were in the line. But you didn't. And want us to believe in that you didn't have time to call. This is a pathetic lie. Second, you might have a fight before you go out. Or you were out for meeting with friends or out after work but didn't want to go home afterwards or whatever reason was. This is why why you were out is important to understand. Did you wife know you would be out for such a time or not, does she hate the reason you were out or not, etc. Such questions are important to understand what's going on and decide who is the AH. It is like me saying someone in the internet got mad at me for no reason, hiding the fact that I said he is saying half truth. Don't get me wrong but I  highly recommend you to ask your wife why she is angry with you.", "Because it was HER pizza. Trust me, I had no chance of eating that. It was her leftover pizza from the night before, and there was only enough left for one person anyway.\n\nShe could have eaten any time. I couldn't. I was 30 minutes away from home and starving, and I was also going out (with her) that night so wouldn't have a chance to eat again for hours as we were in a rush to get ready and go. That's why I decided to eat while driving home, to save time.", "Not in Australia. And I just checked my credit card statement and the burger and small coffee was $15. So the burger was probably $10-11.", "Few things. 1, as already stated, Aus still has Angus burgers. 2, Aus uses the dollar but it\u2019s AUD.

Where are you getting the home part from?", "Never said it wasn\u2019t.  I specifically said in the US, in a parking lot.  I\u2019m an anthropologist, btw, so I understand the concept of cultural norms.", "Exactly.", "I had already ordered my coffee at the window. THEN I decided to get a burger too.\n\nI was out dropping my kids at my mother's house and then stayed, as planned, for a couple of hours because she's lonely. My wife was at home getting ready for us both to go out to an event and stay for two nights.\n\nI still don't believe any of that is relevant but there you go.", "Just want to point out that eating and driving is also illegal just as being on your phone is, it\u2019s called distracted driving.", "Just checked current Aus prices and no burger on the menu is over $10 and most are well under.", "No burger on this [list](https://www.frugalfeeds.com.au/mcdonalds-prices-menu) is $10 the meals are.
