It may not seem like a big deal or make sense to you but your wife may be feeling under appreciated or that you don\u2019t really think of her after the length of time you have been together. \n\nI would highly recommend looking at some relationship building books and even starting with the love languages to see how to best show her in a way she can understand that\u2019s your goal and also in a way that makes HER feel loved. Words, gifts, quality time, acts of service. These are some of them, to one person a kind word is worth it\u2019s weight in gold but to someone else a little toy that they live will be just as valuable or even grabbed you a burger when I stopped for coffee and decided I wanted one too.  \n\nJust thought of you and wanted to do something nice. Even if she didn\u2019t eat it and it got thrown away after 2weeks in fridge death it still will have that consideration love attached to it. \n\nThese are just some things to consider. Love isn\u2019t always practical or may not always make sense without all of the pieces but there may be a common theme when you write down. Wife mad about xyz and what she said she was mad about, then look at each thing and see if you can find a common theme of what behaviors tend to upset her and what they could actually be stemming from, not just the surface situation and not understanding and not looking deeper to try and work together to strengthen the relationship.", "I've read enough.
