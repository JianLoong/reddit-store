{"id": 3168, "submission_id": "z3xe4n", "title": "AITA for \"acting like a spoiled brat\" to get the car I wanted?", "selftext": "I (17F) have my own car that my parents had bought for me for my 16th birthday.  It wasn't a big surprise considering I was dragged to see all the cars and asked what I wanted.\n\nThe process of getting a car was absolutely horrendous.  My parents looked on Facebook marketplace, but since my Facebook had my real age on it, I wasn't able to access it.  They showed me cars, I told them what I liked and didnt like.  Frankly, I didnt care what it was, I just cared how it looked and it could run/wouldn't need repairs.  The problem was, they never listened to my opinions.  They pushed to get a sunroof on my car, but I knew that would be a terrible idea because of my sensitive eyes to the sun.  They pushed to get a GPS into my car, but I've lived here my whole life and know where everything is.  I didn't want them to pay extra for the things they're pushing me to get that I don't want/need.\n\nThey showed me this one car, a 2010 Volkswagen beetle .  I immediately liked it, I liked the color, how it looked, had everything I wanted and needed.  It ran perfectly, had better gas than I thought it would ($35 fills up my whole tank, even with today's prices!). However, my dad didnt like the price it was going for ($6,009).  I was livid.  This was the one car I actually wanted, the one car that had everything.\n\nWe continued looking, and he took me to another Volkswagen Beetle, but it had a sunroof, gps, horrid color, a bunch of other stuff.  I broke down into tears.  In front of the dealer, my whole family.  I told him this is not what I wanted and I wished he'd listen to me.  I refused to even bother with the car and that the other was absolutely perfect for me.  \n\nHe took me back to the other dealer, bought it, and both my parents were complaining the WHOLE time. They said things like \"fucking spoiled brat\" \"this car is horrible\" \"can't believe you don't want a gps\".  After the drive home and parking my very first car, I was upset still.  I almost didnt want it anymore because of how much they talked about me.  Even today, they still tall about it, and tell all our friends and family about what happened and the way I acted.  Everyone thinks I'm a spoiled brat now.\n\nIts thanksgiving, and he brought it up.  It made me upset and I went into my room for a bit and now I'm here. Honestly, I'm not sure if I did act like a spoiled brat.  Maybe I should've gotten something else.  AITA?\n\nEDIT: I wanna be clear that we had been looking for 3 months.  I was NOT quiet about my opinions, but they kept texting me cars I didn't want, and would say no.  Even after saying no, the next day we're going to this strangers address to take a look.  It was frustrating, to keep saying \"no this just isn't want I want\" and moving on for 3 whole months.  I obviously wanted to be happy with my decision. \n\nAll these cars were between $4,000 and $10,000 (I believe we had roughly $50,000 to work with).  A $20,000 corvette was offered to me, but sport cars simply weren't my thing.  So no, my family is not poor, or even middle class.  I know many families are not as fortunate as me, but that isn't the problem here.  The problem is my parents refused to listen to me, and got mad at me when I expressed my feelings (this isn't the first time either).  If they had listen to what I wanted, I wouldn't have broke down.\n\nAlso, if you wanna talk about spoiled, my dad had 4 motorcycles, a mustang, and 2 corvettes, to which my dad got the money from begging my mom.  If I really am spoiled, then it is not my fault my parents raised me this way.  I can take no for an answer (in fact I have my own job now, pay for my own gas and insurance, take care of it, and even pay for damages and accessories).", "created_utc": 1669331346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3xe4n/aita_for_acting_like_a_spoiled_brat_to_get_the/", "score": 561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the clearest ESH I've seen in a while, even though, judging by the comment section, I'm probably gonna be downvoted. Yes, the girl's entitled, it's really nice of the parents to get her a car, they don't have to do it, she should've been more grateful. Why would you ask for the opinion of the giftee though if you're relcutant to take it into account? Why show her something she likes and immediately tell her oh we're not buying you that one? If you wanna pick the car yourself since it's a super expensive gift, you have every right. Don't involve the person, then, though, that's a bit of an ass move, even though she's your child.", "Based on the way you\u2019ve worded this post, YTA. First of all, being \u201cdragged\u201d to see all the cars? This should be exciting for you, and obviously if you care how the car looks, you need to be there in person. \n\nIf you were worried about them spending extra money on additions like a GPS, you should have expressed it, but if they were insistent that they were happy to spend the extra money for those additions, you should have let it go. It\u2019s a free car! Why were you worried about them spending extra money on those things but then you were angry that the car you liked wasn\u2019t a suitable price in their eyes? \n\nYou could\u2019ve expressed this all far more maturely and respectfully. You said that you didn\u2019t care about anything other than looks and how it ran, and acted like it was a huge inconvenience to see the cars, but then you were deeply upset that the car your parents liked had options that you didn\u2019t want. \n\nYou did behave like a spoiled brat, and very ungratefully. That doesn\u2019t mean you are a spoiled brat, or ungrateful, just that this is how it appears. Since this has clearly bothered you, I\u2019d suggest sitting down with your parents and apologising for how you acted, and explaining why that one car was so important to you, and why you ended up feeling overwhelmed enough that you broke down. By going quiet and distancing yourself, you\u2019re not making amends.", "Yeah you are being spoiled, I don\u2019t know why they are so for a sunroof or why you are so against GPS, but my first car was whatever the fuck my dad wanted to buy me, and I thanked him for it.

I wouldn\u2019t have caved to your fit\n\nYTA", "Jesus your tone is set from the first sentence : being \" dragged\" to see all the cars and ask your opinion. Well of course you'd need to see all the options. \n\nHaving a GPS can save your life so have some foresight please. \n\nAnd stop with how the car looks. Even if it's heinous you're 17. You don't need a beautiful car. You need low maintenance well running and dependable.\n\nYou do come off as spoiled. Yta", "I think people are being a little bit harsh on you.  You were wrong to make a big scene at the car dealer but your parents were way out of line to call you a spoiled fucking brat.  Was the 2nd car cheaper than the first?  If it was then you should offer to pay your parents the difference in price.  It sounds like you and your parents don't communicate very well.  You need to talk to them and start by thanking them for buying a car for you.  That was very generous and you need to show that you are grateful.  Try to explain to them that you felt like you were not being heard and that is what upset you.\n\nThe fact that you are feeling guilty about this tells me that you are not a brat.  You are a good person who acted poorly.", "YTA Never look a gift horse in the mouth. If you don\u2019t like the sunroof, keep it closed. If you don\u2019t like the GPS keep it off. IMO GPS is awesome when traveling. I doubt you\u2019ll stay in the same city. All your whining about things is completely being a \u2018spoiled brat\u2019. I was just grateful to have a working car at 17.\n\nOh and it was vomit purple, Buick LeSabre. No gps, gas gauge didn\u2019t work, sounded like it would rattle apart between 60-75 mph.

Anyone who complains about anything to do with being given a free car is an AH.", "You're not sure? Seriously? If I was your parents I wouldn't have bought the car at all.

I think everyone is missing the point here.\n\nYeah, I would have killed to have an option for a 12yo Volkswagen for my first car (ended up getting a 21yo Daewoo), but the fact is, they're taking you around to find a car for _you_ and ignoring literally every input _you_ give. What's the point of taking you car buying if they outright ignore everything you say? It's infantilising and frustrating. I get the feeling this isn't an isolated case.\n\nIn saying that, I do suggest getting an inbuilt GPS, because even though you know where everything is in your town, a car gives you a lot of freedom and eventually you're going to want to drive places you haven't been, and a GPS is very useful for that.", "ESH.\n\nYour parents wanted to buy all the bells and whistles, and you cried when you didn't get your way. They enabled your entitled behavior and you aren't even grateful that they bought a car for you. Did you ever say thank you?", "Yta. You should be grateful your parents are willing to purchase a car for you. I had to save up myself to buy mine.", "Is this real or some attempt to act like a brat to get karma? \n\nIf it's real, then YTA, go buy your own car.\n\nAlso your parents should have just walked away from buying you a car when you behaved like this.", "ESH.\n\nIt is just common courtesy to be grateful for an expensive gift like that even if ifs not exactly what you want - plenty of people have fond memories of a car that at the time they thought was a huge piece of junk.\n\nOn the other hand, once youre in the process of looking its an AH move for them to be like \"What about this one?\" \"Its perfect!\" \"Well youre not getting it, its too expensive.\" Why show it to you if they were just going to turn around and get upset that you liked it.", "YTA, in a soft way. You do realize that most people do not get cars bought for them, don't you? That being out of the way, I do sympathize with you, because it is awful to be run over at every turn and not have people listen to your opinions after they have asked for them. The simple fact that they do not trust you to know your own mind _is_ distressing. Still, you ended up with the car you wanted! Now go and enjoy it! If you don't then you would really be an a**hat.", "YTA. You're not entitled to _any_ car, let alone your first choice, when someome else is paying the bill.", "I'm gonna day ESH\n\nEveryone has already hit the points about you but I do think it's not right to not take your opinions into consideration and to continue to bring it up to anyone and everyone instead of sitting and having a conversation with you and hashing it out. It's not fair to continue to drag you through the mud.", "I'm not going to pass judgement because I think others have said it enough, but I want to add something that resonates from my personal experience. Are you actually upset about the car as the end result, or are you upset because you were pushed for your opinion and it wasn't heard?\n\nI dealt with something kinda like this when I was your age, my parents bought me something expensive, a milestone gift, to acknowledge something I achieved. But the gift came right on the tails of them telling me they couldn't be there in person to see my achievement honoured and I was feeling awful, especially after I had told them how much it would mean for them to be there. I loved and appreciated the gift but I'm sure I didn't express that as well as I could have, because at the time it felt like they were buying it to make up for not being there, and I didn't care about the money or gift, I just wanted them to be present. But at 16 I didn't know how to process or articulate any of that.\n\nSo my point is, if this is just because you didn't get the car you wanted, then Y T A. But if the car doesn't actually matter, and you blew up because your parents pushed you into making a decision they wanted you to make and then expected gratitude without taking your feelings into account, then N T A.", "YTA, at the end of the day, you have the privilege of your parents:\n\n\u2022 being able to afford to buy you a car\n\n\u2022 offering you options (especially luxurious ones)\n\n\u2022 taking you to dealers to see cars\n\n\u2022 buying you a car after you threw a tamper tantrum Cus you didn\u2019t like how it looked (and oh no it has a gps)\n\nSo many kids have to help chip in for their car, get a used car or have to use a family car.

The fact they BOUGHT YOU A CAR and you acted that way says it all.

Coming up with that sort of extra money is a huge endeavor and affects finances for months if not years. Im sure you have, but if you haven't yet, I really encourage you to let them know how much you appreciate them and apologize. As a parent, I have a ton of anxiety about how well ever be able to come up with enough for the things our child needs, and a car doesn't even make that list. Regaurless about how you felt throughout the buying process, they went above and beyond for you as parents for taking you shopping in the first place and you made them feel like you didn't appreciate it.\n\nIn all situations in life: You're only the asshole until you make it right.", "YTA.

You are not spoiled nor do you come off as one in your post.

Your post history reeks of child neglect and emotional abuse, so I can see why you blew up at them. Even without that factor, you had every right to express yourself that way. Sometimes teens need to blow up and show parents that they\u2019re people with feelings, you can clean it up later but everyone needs that moment in their life.

However, as I'm not that much older than you, I'm going to share my own recent experience of getting my first car.\n\nMy (24F) mother recently bought me my first car. I have been late in getting my licence because we live close to lots of public transport and the essentials are within walking distance (supermarkets, the doctor etc). However I am now in the workforce, in a career which requires me to travel further afield on trips which would just take twice as long on a train or tram as it would with a car, so I booked my driving test and my parents took me car hunting.\n\nThey let me do my own research on different cars, including prices and features. I was told that they would buy me a new car (not used). There were a few reasons for this, the main one being that they were concerned about safety and wanted me to have better features and less risk of breaking down or having an accident in my first couple of years on the road. \n\nI initially wanted a 2023 version of my mother's old car (a 2015 VW Golf, which she gave to my brother when he moved out this year) because I had driven Golfs before and knew the set up etc. But due to the pandemic the price of VW Golfs has skyrocketed so our local dealership was selling the one I wanted at roughly $5,000 more than what my mum paid in 2015. Mum told me to look around more to see if I could get a cheaper car for better value.\n\nI landed on a Mazda 2. Test drove it, loved it. $28,000 for a base model, in the vicinity of $30,000+ for the top model. I wanted a little hatchback to get me from A to B with enough boot room to chuck a duffel bag if I was travelling interstate overnight. \n\nThis is the important part. They did not have the base model in stock, so we test drove the top model, which had several added features. This included a 360 degree reversing camera, front parking sensors, a heads up display behind the steering wheel, and several other safety features including a built-in GPS. The 360 degree camera sold my mum, she loved it and thought it was fantastic for being able to park safely. \n\nShe called the dealership the following Monday - she got me to text her the price differences between the base and top models, and a list of my colour preferences (all of which were at no extra cost). If the dealership were firm on the top model price, I said I was perfectly happy with the base model.\n\nShe negotiated them to under $30,000 for the top model, and they threw in both an aux cord and floor mats (which were going to be an extra Christmas present for me) to sweeten the deal. I was rapt, she was over the moon, the car arrives in two weeks.\n\nI know I've been incredibly fortunate, and that I didn't have to get the top model. But my parents dragged me to test drive a Toyota Yaris even though I said I didn't much like it, because they wanted to rule it out. (Afterwards my mum said it was a bit small and she didn't feel like it was very robust, but the point was that we'd ruled it out.) They discussed safety features that I didn't necessarily *want*, but that they wanted me to have to make it safer for me.\n\nSunroofs are a bit of a cosmetic feature and I'm ambivalent - I get cold quite easily so I prefer to just crack the window if I want a bit of fresh air. But things like the GPS can absolutely be useful and sometimes required - where I am, you cannot use your phone for navigation (even with Apple CarPlay) for the first couple of years on your licence - you need to use a built-in navigation system. It's to discourage new drivers from using their phones at all and getting distracted. I know my area very well but regularly drive up to 7 hours away for my sport. GPS comes in handy there. \n\nMy point, after all this long-winded explanation, is that sometimes the safety features you don't think you need will come in handy, and that perhaps your parents had a point about the GPS. Putting aside the sunroof because that's a take-it-or-leave-it - in my opinion - the GPS would come in handy if you decided to drive to, say, the beach or the mountains for a day out with a friend and didn't know where you were going.\n\nI'm really glad you got the car you wanted, and sad on your behalf that your parents are being so mean to you about it - but do you see their side of things too, that they wanted you to have a safe, nice car? You're 17, you've barely had your licence a year (if that), and the highest percentage of accidents occur in the first three years of being licensed. They want you to be safe.\n\nWith that being said, if the car you wanted was cheaper than their options, NTA. Not a spoiled brat. \n\nBut if it was more expensive, with less features, then yeah YTA. It's your first car, it won't do more than get you from A to B for probably 10 years if you treat it well. When you save enough money and enter the workforce after school, you'll be able to buy the exact make, model and colour that you want, with all the features YOU want, with your own money.\n\nDrive safe xo", "NTA", "NTA - They asked you about your opinion and then constantly dismissed it.

That\u2019s what I would worry about- young drivers should form good habits of checking their blind spots, etc.", "She isn't entitled to a car, but she didn't demand them to buy her one either, no? Her parents offered to buy her a car, asked for her input, then chose to ignore every single preference that she had.\n\nI'm in my 30s, I have purchased all my assets by myself (my car, my home, etc.) and I would still be annoyed if I had to spend so much of my time looking at things I didn't actually want under the guise of a present.\n\nOP also mentions her parents are wealthy (have multiple \"just for fun\" cars of their own), tried to buy her a car 2x the price of the one she wanted (she said no), and in her post history apparently her dad has told her he can't wait for her to kill herself.\n\nSo honestly, I feel terribly for her. This seems like it was just the last straw.", "My kids also think I'm wealthy. And her parents are allowed to have cars just for fun. They worked for that. That means nothing. It's still a big purchase. If it's her last straw she should walk away with no car. It's that easy. Decline the vehicle. And this is ridiculous,  she's 17 who said she cares nothing except for how it looks. Its very likely the car she liked had mechanical issues or wasn't worth the amount the seller wanted. I'd rather spend more money on something WORTH THE VALUE then on a hunk of junk cause of how it looks. Its clear from her comments that her parents DID care about the cost. My kids think I'm loaded. I DO make significantly more than the local population,  but I still would find a vehicle to be a large purchase... however, my kids are getting to be teenagers now and have zero concept of my money. They suffer from the same mindset of OP sometimes because they completely miss the legitimate issues I bring to the table. I grew up with nothing, so I'm trying to do my best for my kids and in that they become ungrateful like OP. Fact is, she is owed nothing and she should decline the gift if it comes with strings. Give it back. Move out at 18. If she doesn't want their help them she should leave.", "I think its unfair to force people to get what they don't want. \n\nI take it as like going out to eat, you want to eat just grilled chicken with plain white rice but your parents keeps ignoring you and keeps pointing out expensive seafood lobster or grilled chicken with noodle, when you told them that you just want grilled chicken, they tell you that you should just listen to them and get the seafood lobster. \n\nIn that situation what would you think? You have told them your preference, you have told them no that you don't want lobster. you actually don't mind eating lobster or anything really, its just that they asked you what you want to eat, you told them what you want to eat and then they just ignore what you said. \n\nThe main frustration is not that you don't get to eat the chicken, its the frustration that you are ignored and not listened to.", "Someone being called ungrateful for NOT wanting their parents to spend extra on add ons that they don't want or find necessary is the most insane take I've seen. OP is literally asking their parents to spend less on a car and the only concession is that it's something that they like and somehow that's ungrateful?", "if OP is ungrateful and childish then i don\u2019t see how the parents aren\u2019t the same. shouldn\u2019t they be grateful their child only wants to spend like 10% of their initial budget? isn\u2019t it childish to dangle the car OP wants in front of her only to say never mind and then only offer options that are explicitly what she didn\u2019t ask for? \n\ntheir parents didn\u2019t have to buy OP a car, just like they didn\u2019t have to convince her to drive a car she doesn\u2019t like."]}
