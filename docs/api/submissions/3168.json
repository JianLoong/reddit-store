{"id": 3168, "submission_id": "z3xe4n", "title": "AITA for \"acting like a spoiled brat\" to get the car I wanted?", "selftext": "I (17F) have my own car that my parents had bought for me for my 16th birthday.  It wasn't a big surprise considering I was dragged to see all the cars and asked what I wanted.\n\nThe process of getting a car was absolutely horrendous.  My parents looked on Facebook marketplace, but since my Facebook had my real age on it, I wasn't able to access it.  They showed me cars, I told them what I liked and didnt like.  Frankly, I didnt care what it was, I just cared how it looked and it could run/wouldn't need repairs.  The problem was, they never listened to my opinions.  They pushed to get a sunroof on my car, but I knew that would be a terrible idea because of my sensitive eyes to the sun.  They pushed to get a GPS into my car, but I've lived here my whole life and know where everything is.  I didn't want them to pay extra for the things they're pushing me to get that I don't want/need.\n\nThey showed me this one car, a 2010 Volkswagen beetle .  I immediately liked it, I liked the color, how it looked, had everything I wanted and needed.  It ran perfectly, had better gas than I thought it would ($35 fills up my whole tank, even with today's prices!). However, my dad didnt like the price it was going for ($6,009).  I was livid.  This was the one car I actually wanted, the one car that had everything.\n\nWe continued looking, and he took me to another Volkswagen Beetle, but it had a sunroof, gps, horrid color, a bunch of other stuff.  I broke down into tears.  In front of the dealer, my whole family.  I told him this is not what I wanted and I wished he'd listen to me.  I refused to even bother with the car and that the other was absolutely perfect for me.  \n\nHe took me back to the other dealer, bought it, and both my parents were complaining the WHOLE time. They said things like \"fucking spoiled brat\" \"this car is horrible\" \"can't believe you don't want a gps\".  After the drive home and parking my very first car, I was upset still.  I almost didnt want it anymore because of how much they talked about me.  Even today, they still tall about it, and tell all our friends and family about what happened and the way I acted.  Everyone thinks I'm a spoiled brat now.\n\nIts thanksgiving, and he brought it up.  It made me upset and I went into my room for a bit and now I'm here. Honestly, I'm not sure if I did act like a spoiled brat.  Maybe I should've gotten something else.  AITA?\n\nEDIT: I wanna be clear that we had been looking for 3 months.  I was NOT quiet about my opinions, but they kept texting me cars I didn't want, and would say no.  Even after saying no, the next day we're going to this strangers address to take a look.  It was frustrating, to keep saying \"no this just isn't want I want\" and moving on for 3 whole months.  I obviously wanted to be happy with my decision. \n\nAll these cars were between $4,000 and $10,000 (I believe we had roughly $50,000 to work with).  A $20,000 corvette was offered to me, but sport cars simply weren't my thing.  So no, my family is not poor, or even middle class.  I know many families are not as fortunate as me, but that isn't the problem here.  The problem is my parents refused to listen to me, and got mad at me when I expressed my feelings (this isn't the first time either).  If they had listen to what I wanted, I wouldn't have broke down.\n\nAlso, if you wanna talk about spoiled, my dad had 4 motorcycles, a mustang, and 2 corvettes, to which my dad got the money from begging my mom.  If I really am spoiled, then it is not my fault my parents raised me this way.  I can take no for an answer (in fact I have my own job now, pay for my own gas and insurance, take care of it, and even pay for damages and accessories).", "created_utc": 1669331346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3xe4n/aita_for_acting_like_a_spoiled_brat_to_get_the/", "score": 225, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the clearest ESH I've seen in a while, even though, judging by the comment section, I'm probably gonna be downvoted. Yes, the girl's entitled, it's really nice of the parents to get her a car, they don't have to do it, she should've been more grateful. Why would you ask for the opinion of the giftee though if you're relcutant to take it into account? Why show her something she likes and immediately tell her oh we're not buying you that one? If you wanna pick the car yourself since it's a super expensive gift, you have every right. Don't involve the person, then, though, that's a bit of an ass move, even though she's your child.", "Based on the way you\u2019ve worded this post, YTA. First of all, being \u201cdragged\u201d to see all the cars? This should be exciting for you, and obviously if you care how the car looks, you need to be there in person. \n\nIf you were worried about them spending extra money on additions like a GPS, you should have expressed it, but if they were insistent that they were happy to spend the extra money for those additions, you should have let it go. It\u2019s a free car! Why were you worried about them spending extra money on those things but then you were angry that the car you liked wasn\u2019t a suitable price in their eyes? \n\nYou could\u2019ve expressed this all far more maturely and respectfully. You said that you didn\u2019t care about anything other than looks and how it ran, and acted like it was a huge inconvenience to see the cars, but then you were deeply upset that the car your parents liked had options that you didn\u2019t want. \n\nYou did behave like a spoiled brat, and very ungratefully. That doesn\u2019t mean you are a spoiled brat, or ungrateful, just that this is how it appears. Since this has clearly bothered you, I\u2019d suggest sitting down with your parents and apologising for how you acted, and explaining why that one car was so important to you, and why you ended up feeling overwhelmed enough that you broke down. By going quiet and distancing yourself, you\u2019re not making amends.", "Yeah you are being spoiled, I don\u2019t know why they are so for a sunroof or why you are so against GPS, but my first car was whatever the fuck my dad wanted to buy me, and I thanked him for it.

I wouldn\u2019t have caved to your fit\n\nYTA", "Jesus your tone is set from the first sentence : being \" dragged\" to see all the cars and ask your opinion. Well of course you'd need to see all the options. \n\nHaving a GPS can save your life so have some foresight please. \n\nAnd stop with how the car looks. Even if it's heinous you're 17. You don't need a beautiful car. You need low maintenance well running and dependable.\n\nYou do come off as spoiled. Yta", "I think people are being a little bit harsh on you.  You were wrong to make a big scene at the car dealer but your parents were way out of line to call you a spoiled fucking brat.  Was the 2nd car cheaper than the first?  If it was then you should offer to pay your parents the difference in price.  It sounds like you and your parents don't communicate very well.  You need to talk to them and start by thanking them for buying a car for you.  That was very generous and you need to show that you are grateful.  Try to explain to them that you felt like you were not being heard and that is what upset you.\n\nThe fact that you are feeling guilty about this tells me that you are not a brat.  You are a good person who acted poorly.", "YTA Never look a gift horse in the mouth. If you don\u2019t like the sunroof, keep it closed. If you don\u2019t like the GPS keep it off. IMO GPS is awesome when traveling. I doubt you\u2019ll stay in the same city. All your whining about things is completely being a \u2018spoiled brat\u2019. I was just grateful to have a working car at 17.\n\nOh and it was vomit purple, Buick LeSabre. No gps, gas gauge didn\u2019t work, sounded like it would rattle apart between 60-75 mph.

Anyone who complains about anything to do with being given a free car is an AH.", "You're not sure? Seriously? If I was your parents I wouldn't have bought the car at all.

I think everyone is missing the point here.\n\nYeah, I would have killed to have an option for a 12yo Volkswagen for my first car (ended up getting a 21yo Daewoo), but the fact is, they're taking you around to find a car for _you_ and ignoring literally every input _you_ give. What's the point of taking you car buying if they outright ignore everything you say? It's infantilising and frustrating. I get the feeling this isn't an isolated case.\n\nIn saying that, I do suggest getting an inbuilt GPS, because even though you know where everything is in your town, a car gives you a lot of freedom and eventually you're going to want to drive places you haven't been, and a GPS is very useful for that.", "ESH.\n\nYour parents wanted to buy all the bells and whistles, and you cried when you didn't get your way. They enabled your entitled behavior and you aren't even grateful that they bought a car for you. Did you ever say thank you?", "Yta. You should be grateful your parents are willing to purchase a car for you. I had to save up myself to buy mine.", "Is this real or some attempt to act like a brat to get karma? \n\nIf it's real, then YTA, go buy your own car.\n\nAlso your parents should have just walked away from buying you a car when you behaved like this.", "ESH.\n\nIt is just common courtesy to be grateful for an expensive gift like that even if ifs not exactly what you want - plenty of people have fond memories of a car that at the time they thought was a huge piece of junk.\n\nOn the other hand, once youre in the process of looking its an AH move for them to be like \"What about this one?\" \"Its perfect!\" \"Well youre not getting it, its too expensive.\" Why show it to you if they were just going to turn around and get upset that you liked it.", "YTA, in a soft way. You do realize that most people do not get cars bought for them, don't you? That being out of the way, I do sympathize with you, because it is awful to be run over at every turn and not have people listen to your opinions after they have asked for them. The simple fact that they do not trust you to know your own mind _is_ distressing. Still, you ended up with the car you wanted! Now go and enjoy it! If you don't then you would really be an a**hat.", "YTA. You're not entitled to _any_ car, let alone your first choice, when someome else is paying the bill.", "I'm gonna day ESH\n\nEveryone has already hit the points about you but I do think it's not right to not take your opinions into consideration and to continue to bring it up to anyone and everyone instead of sitting and having a conversation with you and hashing it out. It's not fair to continue to drag you through the mud.", "I'm not going to pass judgement because I think others have said it enough, but I want to add something that resonates from my personal experience. Are you actually upset about the car as the end result, or are you upset because you were pushed for your opinion and it wasn't heard?\n\nI dealt with something kinda like this when I was your age, my parents bought me something expensive, a milestone gift, to acknowledge something I achieved. But the gift came right on the tails of them telling me they couldn't be there in person to see my achievement honoured and I was feeling awful, especially after I had told them how much it would mean for them to be there. I loved and appreciated the gift but I'm sure I didn't express that as well as I could have, because at the time it felt like they were buying it to make up for not being there, and I didn't care about the money or gift, I just wanted them to be present. But at 16 I didn't know how to process or articulate any of that.\n\nSo my point is, if this is just because you didn't get the car you wanted, then Y T A. But if the car doesn't actually matter, and you blew up because your parents pushed you into making a decision they wanted you to make and then expected gratitude without taking your feelings into account, then N T A.", "YTA, at the end of the day, you have the privilege of your parents:\n\n\u2022 being able to afford to buy you a car\n\n\u2022 offering you options (especially luxurious ones)\n\n\u2022 taking you to dealers to see cars\n\n\u2022 buying you a car after you threw a tamper tantrum Cus you didn\u2019t like how it looked (and oh no it has a gps)\n\nSo many kids have to help chip in for their car, get a used car or have to use a family car.

The fact they BOUGHT YOU A CAR and you acted that way says it all.

Coming up with that sort of extra money is a huge endeavor and affects finances for months if not years. Im sure you have, but if you haven't yet, I really encourage you to let them know how much you appreciate them and apologize. As a parent, I have a ton of anxiety about how well ever be able to come up with enough for the things our child needs, and a car doesn't even make that list. Regaurless about how you felt throughout the buying process, they went above and beyond for you as parents for taking you shopping in the first place and you made them feel like you didn't appreciate it.\n\nIn all situations in life: You're only the asshole until you make it right.", "YTA.

They sent me the car, but they didn't like it, but I was okay with it.  We looked at it, test drove it, and everything, and when we were ready to buy, my mom saw another car for cheaper and said \"we (they) changed our (their) mind.\"", "Looking at her post history it's obvious her dad is at best neglectful (she had a potentially broken hand and they didn't take her to a doctor?!) and at worst emotionally abusive (has told her he's waiting for her to \"end it \\[her life\\]\"), and she herself seems to suffer from pretty bad depression. This seems to me like a teenager at her wit's end with being ignored and this was just the final straw that made her break down, at unfortunately a moment that made her seem worse than she is.\n\nAs presented, yeah Y-T-A but with further context I have to go with ESH. She's ungrateful, but she's a teenager, and they grow out of that if their parents actually parent. OP's parents, if they're not as bad as her posts, are dropping the ball big time with her mental health.", "They wanted to give her a showoffy car to sho off what awesome parents they are to their friends", "She made it clear repeatedly she didn't want that kind of car. Wanting a car you like isn't being spoiled as long as it's within budget, which it seems this car was since OP said the cars her parents showed ranged in price from 4000-10 000.", "Then save for your own car. I did at 17. Don't owe your parents. Sure, my car was crappy, but I'd have literally been over the moon for a free car.", "If you give someone a gift you should pick something the person who's recieving the gift like.

You cannot be real. YTA, so so much. Spoiled and entitled.", "I would say you're in a shit position kiddo... Because they are unhappy with a decision they made and not seeing it. Even otherwise lovely parents don't always hear that message well from their kids. (Probably me included.)\n\nYou might need to have a conversation with your parents, and make sure they understand what your frustration was. (Not being heard.) Leave the car out of it, if you can. \n\nIt's okay when they bring it up to patiently say \"thank you for getting me a car at all. Remember, I was upset you guys weren't hearing me, *not* upset about the specific car. In retrospect I wish we had gone home instead of back to get the car, so we could have made the decision in a calm moment you guys wouldn't resent.\"\n\nWhether you make any headway or not, try to be grateful that they got you ANY car (it's not a thing to take for granted. I'm sure you *know* that, but knowing the fact and really feeling it are different... Most kids don't get cars that early, or actually have any choice in what.)\n\nAnd I hope that this is not a pattern (their inability to hear you), and that it's more... Frustration with the process (car buying sucks, especially right now!), and with having reasons they want things for you that they can't adequately explain.\n\n(It's not easy being a parent, either. We also still get overwhelmed. Especially when we are trying to make the right decision around our kids... Be patient with them, if you can... they screw up, too. \ud83d\udc9c)\n\n*I* am imagining wanting a GPS for my kiddo, so that when they DO drive to an unfamiliar place, I know they can find their way even if their phone dies or gets broken or stolen or dropped in a toilet in a club somewhere. (We think of these things because we know 16yos turn 18 awfully soon, and go places they can't imagine at 16... But if we try to articulate that, we sound all parental and \"you'll understand when you're older\"... We know it. It's painful.)", "Thanks for drawing attention to that. This poor kid.", "She wanted a cheaper car with less options, her parents were trying to show off by getting her something that she didn't like with all the bells and whistles, the car wasn't actually about her.", "Go look at her post history.

Loving parents don't bring up behaviour they don't like all the time to make their child feel bad. Loving parents don't tell their entire family and friends about situations like this to make the child look bad. \n\nThey didn't want to buy her a car, they wanted to buy themselves a car and used her as an excuse to do it.

Never again.", ">Dad just thought it was too expensive to what he thought it was worth, it could have been cheaper than the second car: \n\n>However, my dad didnt like the price it was going for ($6,009).\n\nAnd depending on other factors (like mileage, most importantly), the first car could have been overpriced compared to the second. We don't know any details about the first car other than that OP liked it, but there are plenty of cars that are on the market for more than they're worth considering a lack of features/mileage/history. \n\nOP doean't mention any of these things and only talks about whether she likes the car or not. Which yes, is important, but so are those other factors. And sometimes we have to give up on the color we want it to be in favor of a car with better mileage that'll last you longer. When my parents bought me my car, I knew I was lucky to get it in a color I liked. But I would have completely understood and accepted it if it had been a color I hated, bc I knew other factors were more important. \n\n>LOL it's like you've never heard of smartphones and Google Maps and the like. \n\nWhich can cost data to use if you don't have a plan, or are useless in a place with no reception. A gps is a good backup in case something ever happens to your phone. \n\n>They're also a point of failure, increasing chances for leaks and repairs for the motor/mechanism, etc.\n\nBut if you never use it, isn't there less of a chance of that happening? \n\n>I'm just defending against bad points because you seem to be trying to rationalize why OP should disregard her own preferences\n\nBc some of those preferences are just not as important as other car features. I mean first of all, whether the car actually has a gps instead of not having one doesn't matter at all, bc it costs her nothing to not use it if she doesn't want to. Second, yes, the color of the car is not nearly as important as how much mileage the car has. If car one had 100,000 miles on it and car 2 has significantly less, car 2 is unquestionably better.", "It was just one example that's easy enough to change. Let's suppose I had a partner that told me she wanted to be proposed to with a ring containing an amethyst, and I went out and bought her a diamond ring instead. In that situation there's nothing wrong with her ring, it's perfectly usable and you don't even need a ring at all to get married. I would still be the asshole for ignoring what she wanted and I wouldn't blame her for getting upset.", "she talked about how her dad offered her a corvette. money is no object, and yet she protests for the sake of protesting. her parents wanted her to have a nice car and she complained. she's acting contrarian for the sake of being a brat, then pretending to not to have done that at all.

But that comment specifically said ***more expensive***, and nowhere does OP say they didn't buy it because its price was more than the other car. Dad just didn't think the car was a good enough deal, completely different thing.", "I specifically said it ***could*** have been cheaper, I wasn't saying options made it more expensive or anything like that. My issue was that other comment said \n\n>but they didn\u2019t want to buy it since it was ***more expensive***\n\nwhen there was no actual comparison of which car between the two was \"more expensive\". Dad just thought the first car wasn't a good enough deal, a much different thing and thus \"more expensive\" was 100% something created out of thin air.", "That analogy works better :) I still think OP was ungrateful and childish.
