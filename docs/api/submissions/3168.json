{"id": 3168, "submission_id": "z3xe4n", "title": "AITA for \"acting like a spoiled brat\" to get the car I wanted?", "selftext": "I (17F) have my own car that my parents had bought for me for my 16th birthday.  It wasn't a big surprise considering I was dragged to see all the cars and asked what I wanted.\n\nThe process of getting a car was absolutely horrendous.  My parents looked on Facebook marketplace, but since my Facebook had my real age on it, I wasn't able to access it.  They showed me cars, I told them what I liked and didnt like.  Frankly, I didnt care what it was, I just cared how it looked and it could run/wouldn't need repairs.  The problem was, they never listened to my opinions.  They pushed to get a sunroof on my car, but I knew that would be a terrible idea because of my sensitive eyes to the sun.  They pushed to get a GPS into my car, but I've lived here my whole life and know where everything is.  I didn't want them to pay extra for the things they're pushing me to get that I don't want/need.\n\nThey showed me this one car, a 2010 Volkswagen beetle .  I immediately liked it, I liked the color, how it looked, had everything I wanted and needed.  It ran perfectly, had better gas than I thought it would ($35 fills up my whole tank, even with today's prices!). However, my dad didnt like the price it was going for ($6,009).  I was livid.  This was the one car I actually wanted, the one car that had everything.\n\nWe continued looking, and he took me to another Volkswagen Beetle, but it had a sunroof, gps, horrid color, a bunch of other stuff.  I broke down into tears.  In front of the dealer, my whole family.  I told him this is not what I wanted and I wished he'd listen to me.  I refused to even bother with the car and that the other was absolutely perfect for me.  \n\nHe took me back to the other dealer, bought it, and both my parents were complaining the WHOLE time. They said things like \"fucking spoiled brat\" \"this car is horrible\" \"can't believe you don't want a gps\".  After the drive home and parking my very first car, I was upset still.  I almost didnt want it anymore because of how much they talked about me.  Even today, they still tall about it, and tell all our friends and family about what happened and the way I acted.  Everyone thinks I'm a spoiled brat now.\n\nIts thanksgiving, and he brought it up.  It made me upset and I went into my room for a bit and now I'm here. Honestly, I'm not sure if I did act like a spoiled brat.  Maybe I should've gotten something else.  AITA?\n\nEDIT: I wanna be clear that we had been looking for 3 months.  I was NOT quiet about my opinions, but they kept texting me cars I didn't want, and would say no.  Even after saying no, the next day we're going to this strangers address to take a look.  It was frustrating, to keep saying \"no this just isn't want I want\" and moving on for 3 whole months.  I obviously wanted to be happy with my decision. \n\nAll these cars were between $4,000 and $10,000 (I believe we had roughly $50,000 to work with).  A $20,000 corvette was offered to me, but sport cars simply weren't my thing.  So no, my family is not poor, or even middle class.  I know many families are not as fortunate as me, but that isn't the problem here.  The problem is my parents refused to listen to me, and got mad at me when I expressed my feelings (this isn't the first time either).  If they had listen to what I wanted, I wouldn't have broke down.\n\nAlso, if you wanna talk about spoiled, my dad had 4 motorcycles, a mustang, and 2 corvettes, to which my dad got the money from begging my mom.  If I really am spoiled, then it is not my fault my parents raised me this way.  I can take no for an answer (in fact I have my own job now, pay for my own gas and insurance, take care of it, and even pay for damages and accessories).", "created_utc": 1669331346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3xe4n/aita_for_acting_like_a_spoiled_brat_to_get_the/", "score": 1316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the clearest E S H I've seen in a while, even though, judging by the comment section, I'm probably gonna be downvoted. Yes, the girl's entitled, it's really nice of the parents to get her a car, they don't have to do it, she should've been more grateful. Why would you ask for the opinion of the giftee though if you're relcutant to take it into account? Why show her something she likes and immediately tell her oh we're not buying you that one? If you wanna pick the car yourself since it's a super expensive gift, you have every right. Don't involve the person, then, though, that's a bit of an ass move, even though she's your child.\n\nETA: After seeing the edit, I'm changing my verdict. You're NTA, I don't know why your parents dragged you around like this. Your post history tells me this is a pattern. You're having troubles with your job, too, and no appropriate support.

You don't need a beautiful car. You need low maintenance well running and dependable.\n\nYou do come off as spoiled. Yta", "I think people are being a little bit harsh on you.  You were wrong to make a big scene at the car dealer but your parents were way out of line to call you a spoiled fucking brat.  Was the 2nd car cheaper than the first?  If it was then you should offer to pay your parents the difference in price.  It sounds like you and your parents don't communicate very well.  You need to talk to them and start by thanking them for buying a car for you.  That was very generous and you need to show that you are grateful.  Try to explain to them that you felt like you were not being heard and that is what upset you.\n\nThe fact that you are feeling guilty about this tells me that you are not a brat.  You are a good person who acted poorly.", "YTA Never look a gift horse in the mouth. If you don\u2019t like the sunroof, keep it closed. If you don\u2019t like the GPS keep it off. IMO GPS is awesome when traveling. I doubt you\u2019ll stay in the same city. All your whining about things is completely being a \u2018spoiled brat\u2019.

I get the feeling this isn't an isolated case.\n\nIn saying that, I do suggest getting an inbuilt GPS, because even though you know where everything is in your town, a car gives you a lot of freedom and eventually you're going to want to drive places you haven't been, and a GPS is very useful for that.", "ESH.\n\nYour parents wanted to buy all the bells and whistles, and you cried when you didn't get your way.

You do realize that most people do not get cars bought for them, don't you? That being out of the way, I do sympathize with you, because it is awful to be run over at every turn and not have people listen to your opinions after they have asked for them. The simple fact that they do not trust you to know your own mind _is_ distressing. Still, you ended up with the car you wanted! Now go and enjoy it!

You're not entitled to _any_ car, let alone your first choice, when someome else is paying the bill.", "I'm gonna day ESH\n\nEveryone has already hit the points about you but I do think it's not right to not take your opinions into consideration and to continue to bring it up to anyone and everyone instead of sitting and having a conversation with you and hashing it out. It's not fair to continue to drag you through the mud.", "I'm not going to pass judgement because I think others have said it enough, but I want to add something that resonates from my personal experience. Are you actually upset about the car as the end result, or are you upset because you were pushed for your opinion and it wasn't heard?\n\nI dealt with something kinda like this when I was your age, my parents bought me something expensive, a milestone gift, to acknowledge something I achieved. But the gift came right on the tails of them telling me they couldn't be there in person to see my achievement honoured and I was feeling awful, especially after I had told them how much it would mean for them to be there. I loved and appreciated the gift but I'm sure I didn't express that as well as I could have, because at the time it felt like they were buying it to make up for not being there, and I didn't care about the money or gift, I just wanted them to be present. But at 16 I didn't know how to process or articulate any of that.\n\nSo my point is, if this is just because you didn't get the car you wanted, then Y T A.

As a parent, I have a ton of anxiety about how well ever be able to come up with enough for the things our child needs, and a car doesn't even make that list.

Also not wanting a sunroof or gps is reasonable. I use my phone for gps and my old ass used car has a sunroof, it leaks like you would not believe. You didn\u2019t cry because you weren\u2019t getting what you wanted, you cried because you were frustrated and felt like your opinion didn\u2019t matter on something that very much involved and was about you. It\u2019s totally reasonable to want a car you like and has what you want and nothing extra. My first car was a hand me down and I loved it, my current car used to belong to the neighbors, it was the cheapest we could buy and I do like it besides the issues. Honestly if I was in your situation I would\u2019ve cried too, hell I have cried when things like that happen. Them bringing it up again and again and again is awful, especially after they called you names and are still just calling you names.

However, as I'm not that much older than you, I'm going to share my own recent experience of getting my first car.\n\nMy (24F) mother recently bought me my first car. I have been late in getting my licence because we live close to lots of public transport and the essentials are within walking distance (supermarkets, the doctor etc). However I am now in the workforce, in a career which requires me to travel further afield on trips which would just take twice as long on a train or tram as it would with a car, so I booked my driving test and my parents took me car hunting.\n\nThey let me do my own research on different cars, including prices and features. I was told that they would buy me a new car (not used). There were a few reasons for this, the main one being that they were concerned about safety and wanted me to have better features and less risk of breaking down or having an accident in my first couple of years on the road. \n\nI initially wanted a 2023 version of my mother's old car (a 2015 VW Golf, which she gave to my brother when he moved out this year) because I had driven Golfs before and knew the set up etc. But due to the pandemic the price of VW Golfs has skyrocketed so our local dealership was selling the one I wanted at roughly $5,000 more than what my mum paid in 2015. Mum told me to look around more to see if I could get a cheaper car for better value.\n\nI landed on a Mazda 2. Test drove it, loved it. $28,000 for a base model, in the vicinity of $30,000+ for the top model. I wanted a little hatchback to get me from A to B with enough boot room to chuck a duffel bag if I was travelling interstate overnight. \n\nThis is the important part. They did not have the base model in stock, so we test drove the top model, which had several added features. This included a 360 degree reversing camera, front parking sensors, a heads up display behind the steering wheel, and several other safety features including a built-in GPS. The 360 degree camera sold my mum, she loved it and thought it was fantastic for being able to park safely. \n\nShe called the dealership the following Monday - she got me to text her the price differences between the base and top models, and a list of my colour preferences (all of which were at no extra cost). If the dealership were firm on the top model price, I said I was perfectly happy with the base model.\n\nShe negotiated them to under $30,000 for the top model, and they threw in both an aux cord and floor mats (which were going to be an extra Christmas present for me) to sweeten the deal. I was rapt, she was over the moon, the car arrives in two weeks.\n\nI know I've been incredibly fortunate, and that I didn't have to get the top model. But my parents dragged me to test drive a Toyota Yaris even though I said I didn't much like it, because they wanted to rule it out. (Afterwards my mum said it was a bit small and she didn't feel like it was very robust, but the point was that we'd ruled it out.) They discussed safety features that I didn't necessarily *want*, but that they wanted me to have to make it safer for me.\n\nSunroofs are a bit of a cosmetic feature and I'm ambivalent - I get cold quite easily so I prefer to just crack the window if I want a bit of fresh air. But things like the GPS can absolutely be useful and sometimes required - where I am, you cannot use your phone for navigation (even with Apple CarPlay) for the first couple of years on your licence - you need to use a built-in navigation system. It's to discourage new drivers from using their phones at all and getting distracted. I know my area very well but regularly drive up to 7 hours away for my sport. GPS comes in handy there. \n\nMy point, after all this long-winded explanation, is that sometimes the safety features you don't think you need will come in handy, and that perhaps your parents had a point about the GPS. Putting aside the sunroof because that's a take-it-or-leave-it - in my opinion - the GPS would come in handy if you decided to drive to, say, the beach or the mountains for a day out with a friend and didn't know where you were going.\n\nI'm really glad you got the car you wanted, and sad on your behalf that your parents are being so mean to you about it - but do you see their side of things too, that they wanted you to have a safe, nice car? You're 17, you've barely had your licence a year (if that), and the highest percentage of accidents occur in the first three years of being licensed. They want you to be safe.\n\nWith that being said, if the car you wanted was cheaper than their options, NTA. Not a spoiled brat. \n\nBut if it was more expensive, with less features, then yeah YTA. It's your first car, it won't do more than get you from A to B for probably 10 years if you treat it well. When you save enough money and enter the workforce after school, you'll be able to buy the exact make, model and colour that you want, with all the features YOU want, with your own money.\n\nDrive safe xo", "NTA", "NTA - They asked you about your opinion and then constantly dismissed it.

I learned to hate Christmas, my birthday, and asking honestly for anything so much because it meant this horrendous guilt and not showing enough appreciation. I remember one Christmas I asked for a cheap guitar, I found one on sale a kids guitar for 40 bucks I really really wanted, I asked so much for it. I didn\u2019t get it, brother did and when I saw I cried so hard. My mom threatened to take away any presents because of this and my entire family berated me.

I rather have made cookies and never opened a present in my life then hear about how much my mom spent and how stressful it was, one year she told me she just couldn\u2019t afford Christmas and I told her it was whatever I didn\u2019t care so I got an iou and my siblings got an Xbox and a gamboy(back child support I think came through)I felt so jealous and shitty but honestly I learned that was there best Christmas so I feel so much better knowing that. As the oldest I always got the brunt of it and it really sucked a lot, I walked around with holes in my shoes and once without a bed sleeping on blankets on the floor for months.

I don\u2019t think you are spoiled.  It\u2019s not okay for your family to make you feel shitty about this and it very much reminds me of every damn Christmas all over again, if you didn\u2019t ask for something why the hell is someone asking you to be thankful?? I would never do this to a kid, I love my family but never once did they ever buy me something I wanted and never once did they not rub it in my face after.

I guess it's possible some of the nicer, newer cars have what you described, but it is rare.\n\nThe reason I thought GPS referred to something that has a built-in map is that I visited the US a while back and rented a car that had it. But I do realize that that was quite some time ago.", "I\u2019m super intrigued as to which colour you ended up with!", "When I was shopping for a Suburban, I needed the middle bench, leather seats. And a light color. It was daunting because so many were black exterior and interior. I live in Florida, there is no way I am intentionally buying a black car. I've  had reds, white, silver, and 1 black car. Even a blazing hot day with leather seats is less difficult to cool than my other vehicles. My husband bought a black truck with cloth seats and it is a complete pain in the ass to cool off his truck. I used to be not picky about colors because finances dictated options.", "Says the brat who doesn't even listen to what op says, can see you gonna be a great dad just like her dad is", "Google maps isn't bad, but I really prefer Waze. It can be updated by users so some rural areas aren't mapped very well, but I live in a large city so information is very dynamic, including locations of accidents and slow downs. Also you can share your route with other Waze users so you know when your guests are arriving. It's really accurate estimating arrival time.\n\nI also think it's free? I know I don't pay a subscription fee.", "Do you people not have phones?", "Beetles are Classics, not basic models. You will always find a Beetle-Lover, especially for older models, without all the tech-stuff.", "Then why not just explain that to OP?", "I'd think OP sounds like someone that'll drive the car for a long time though, so while resale value is _some_ factor it's not like they're buying a one year old car. It's 12 years old already.", "Its OPs first car, that thing will probably get scratches soon chances for hopefully only small accidentens are higher. I remember hearing somewhere that you are considered an inexperienced driver year(s) after you got your license in my country. Getting someone their first car with the intention to resell is risky, well unless the new driver does not actually drive it.", "Bullshit. 12 year old car with all the bells and whistles doesn't increase the value, it's just more shit to break and expensive to fix. \n\nAnd for a VW you can get android-based head units that are drop-in replacements and have all the features of the stock navigation unit and a hell of a lot more. Shittiest (but still equivalent to stock) are sub-$100 and the more expensive ones still a couple hundred more.", "Looking at 12 year old VWs doesn\u2019t exactly give off the air of wealth and luxury.", "Well there's that too. Most people I know just shove their phone in a holder. But the commenters were talking about if the phone ran out of charge or was stolen so...I was just saying, even if the phone isn't an option, it shouldn't be an issue.", "Depends on if this is an OG classic beetle or one of the fugly 2000's ones. As OP said it was reliable and fuel efficient I'm not convinced it's the classic!", "It's a 2010, this isn't a classic, nor will it ever really be. It's just another golf, made worse to have a \"cute\" body draped over the top of it. You don't buy it for resale, or to hold onto, you buy it because it's a Volkswagen from back when they were somewhat reliable. And noone cares about features on these cars, people buy them for the same reason the OP did, it's a decent reliable car and it comes in cute colours. That's it.", "\"this gift for you is actually an investment for us, so we're not REALLY asking what you'd like, unless it's also what we'd like.\"", "The point is I think her parents are seeing her gift as their property still, which is peak assholery.", "The ones you call fugly have lovers, too.", "I drive a Toyota Prado 2021 (US equivalent of Lexus GX460) top of the range and the GPS software is beyond shocking! I've even reported it to Toyota, with no luck & no software updates.\n\nWe HAVE to use our phones to not end up on the other side of the country!", "But less classic status and resale value.", "I used to live on a double-parked street with enough space for one car to drive down the middle, in the UK. You can imagine how small that is.\n\nI could parallel park a landrover in any space on that street. Hell, at the time, I had a massive alcohol problem - I could parallel park that landrover *drunk*.\n\nI've since moved away (and sobered up!); These days I can't parallel park for shit. \n\nThe less you do something, the worse you get at it. \n\nJudgement; op is squarely NTA for having a specific thing they wanted. A gift you explicitly said you don't want is no gift at all; it's an imposition. Also, sunroofs are stupid on older model cars, because they leak and cause all sorts of bullshit to deal with"]}
