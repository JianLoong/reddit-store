{"id": 3168, "submission_id": "z3xe4n", "title": "AITA for \"acting like a spoiled brat\" to get the car I wanted?", "selftext": "I (17F) have my own car that my parents had bought for me for my 16th birthday.  It wasn't a big surprise considering I was dragged to see all the cars and asked what I wanted.\n\nThe process of getting a car was absolutely horrendous.  My parents looked on Facebook marketplace, but since my Facebook had my real age on it, I wasn't able to access it.  They showed me cars, I told them what I liked and didnt like.  Frankly, I didnt care what it was, I just cared how it looked and it could run/wouldn't need repairs.  The problem was, they never listened to my opinions.  They pushed to get a sunroof on my car, but I knew that would be a terrible idea because of my sensitive eyes to the sun.  They pushed to get a GPS into my car, but I've lived here my whole life and know where everything is.  I didn't want them to pay extra for the things they're pushing me to get that I don't want/need.\n\nThey showed me this one car, a 2010 Volkswagen beetle .  I immediately liked it, I liked the color, how it looked, had everything I wanted and needed.  It ran perfectly, had better gas than I thought it would ($35 fills up my whole tank, even with today's prices!). However, my dad didnt like the price it was going for ($6,009).  I was livid.  This was the one car I actually wanted, the one car that had everything.\n\nWe continued looking, and he took me to another Volkswagen Beetle, but it had a sunroof, gps, horrid color, a bunch of other stuff.  I broke down into tears.  In front of the dealer, my whole family.  I told him this is not what I wanted and I wished he'd listen to me.  I refused to even bother with the car and that the other was absolutely perfect for me.  \n\nHe took me back to the other dealer, bought it, and both my parents were complaining the WHOLE time. They said things like \"fucking spoiled brat\" \"this car is horrible\" \"can't believe you don't want a gps\".  After the drive home and parking my very first car, I was upset still.  I almost didnt want it anymore because of how much they talked about me.  Even today, they still tall about it, and tell all our friends and family about what happened and the way I acted.  Everyone thinks I'm a spoiled brat now.\n\nIts thanksgiving, and he brought it up.  It made me upset and I went into my room for a bit and now I'm here. Honestly, I'm not sure if I did act like a spoiled brat.  Maybe I should've gotten something else.  AITA?\n\nEDIT: I wanna be clear that we had been looking for 3 months.  I was NOT quiet about my opinions, but they kept texting me cars I didn't want, and would say no.  Even after saying no, the next day we're going to this strangers address to take a look.  It was frustrating, to keep saying \"no this just isn't want I want\" and moving on for 3 whole months.  I obviously wanted to be happy with my decision. \n\nAll these cars were between $4,000 and $10,000 (I believe we had roughly $50,000 to work with).  A $20,000 corvette was offered to me, but sport cars simply weren't my thing.  So no, my family is not poor, or even middle class.  I know many families are not as fortunate as me, but that isn't the problem here.  The problem is my parents refused to listen to me, and got mad at me when I expressed my feelings (this isn't the first time either).  If they had listen to what I wanted, I wouldn't have broke down.\n\nAlso, if you wanna talk about spoiled, my dad had 4 motorcycles, a mustang, and 2 corvettes, to which my dad got the money from begging my mom.  If I really am spoiled, then it is not my fault my parents raised me this way.  I can take no for an answer (in fact I have my own job now, pay for my own gas and insurance, take care of it, and even pay for damages and accessories).", "created_utc": 1669331346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3xe4n/aita_for_acting_like_a_spoiled_brat_to_get_the/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the clearest ESH I've seen in a while, even though, judging by the comment section, I'm probably gonna be downvoted. Yes, the girl's entitled, it's really nice of the parents to get her a car, they don't have to do it, she should've been more grateful. Why would you ask for the opinion of the giftee though if you're relcutant to take it into account? Why show her something she likes and immediately tell her oh we're not buying you that one? If you wanna pick the car yourself since it's a super expensive gift, you have every right. Don't involve the person, then, though, that's a bit of an ass move, even though she's your child.", "Based on the way you\u2019ve worded this post, YTA. First of all, being \u201cdragged\u201d to see all the cars? This should be exciting for you, and obviously if you care how the car looks, you need to be there in person. \n\nIf you were worried about them spending extra money on additions like a GPS, you should have expressed it, but if they were insistent that they were happy to spend the extra money for those additions, you should have let it go. It\u2019s a free car! Why were you worried about them spending extra money on those things but then you were angry that the car you liked wasn\u2019t a suitable price in their eyes? \n\nYou could\u2019ve expressed this all far more maturely and respectfully. You said that you didn\u2019t care about anything other than looks and how it ran, and acted like it was a huge inconvenience to see the cars, but then you were deeply upset that the car your parents liked had options that you didn\u2019t want. \n\nYou did behave like a spoiled brat, and very ungratefully. That doesn\u2019t mean you are a spoiled brat, or ungrateful, just that this is how it appears. Since this has clearly bothered you, I\u2019d suggest sitting down with your parents and apologising for how you acted, and explaining why that one car was so important to you, and why you ended up feeling overwhelmed enough that you broke down. By going quiet and distancing yourself, you\u2019re not making amends.", "Yeah you are being spoiled, I don\u2019t know why they are so for a sunroof or why you are so against GPS, but my first car was whatever the fuck my dad wanted to buy me, and I thanked him for it.

I wouldn\u2019t have caved to your fit\n\nYTA", "Jesus your tone is set from the first sentence : being \" dragged\" to see all the cars and ask your opinion. Well of course you'd need to see all the options. \n\nHaving a GPS can save your life so have some foresight please. \n\nAnd stop with how the car looks. Even if it's heinous you're 17. You don't need a beautiful car. You need low maintenance well running and dependable.\n\nYou do come off as spoiled. Yta", "I think people are being a little bit harsh on you.  You were wrong to make a big scene at the car dealer but your parents were way out of line to call you a spoiled fucking brat.  Was the 2nd car cheaper than the first?  If it was then you should offer to pay your parents the difference in price.  It sounds like you and your parents don't communicate very well.  You need to talk to them and start by thanking them for buying a car for you.  That was very generous and you need to show that you are grateful.  Try to explain to them that you felt like you were not being heard and that is what upset you.\n\nThe fact that you are feeling guilty about this tells me that you are not a brat.  You are a good person who acted poorly.", "YTA Never look a gift horse in the mouth. If you don\u2019t like the sunroof, keep it closed. If you don\u2019t like the GPS keep it off. IMO GPS is awesome when traveling. I doubt you\u2019ll stay in the same city. All your whining about things is completely being a \u2018spoiled brat\u2019. I was just grateful to have a working car at 17.\n\nOh and it was vomit purple, Buick LeSabre. No gps, gas gauge didn\u2019t work, sounded like it would rattle apart between 60-75 mph.

Anyone who complains about anything to do with being given a free car is an AH.", "You're not sure? Seriously? If I was your parents I wouldn't have bought the car at all.

I think everyone is missing the point here.\n\nYeah, I would have killed to have an option for a 12yo Volkswagen for my first car (ended up getting a 21yo Daewoo), but the fact is, they're taking you around to find a car for _you_ and ignoring literally every input _you_ give. What's the point of taking you car buying if they outright ignore everything you say? It's infantilising and frustrating. I get the feeling this isn't an isolated case.\n\nIn saying that, I do suggest getting an inbuilt GPS, because even though you know where everything is in your town, a car gives you a lot of freedom and eventually you're going to want to drive places you haven't been, and a GPS is very useful for that.", "ESH.\n\nYour parents wanted to buy all the bells and whistles, and you cried when you didn't get your way. They enabled your entitled behavior and you aren't even grateful that they bought a car for you. Did you ever say thank you?", "Yta. You should be grateful your parents are willing to purchase a car for you. I had to save up myself to buy mine.", "Is this real or some attempt to act like a brat to get karma? \n\nIf it's real, then YTA, go buy your own car.\n\nAlso your parents should have just walked away from buying you a car when you behaved like this.", "ESH.\n\nIt is just common courtesy to be grateful for an expensive gift like that even if ifs not exactly what you want - plenty of people have fond memories of a car that at the time they thought was a huge piece of junk.\n\nOn the other hand, once youre in the process of looking its an AH move for them to be like \"What about this one?\" \"Its perfect!\" \"Well youre not getting it, its too expensive.\" Why show it to you if they were just going to turn around and get upset that you liked it.", "YTA, in a soft way. You do realize that most people do not get cars bought for them, don't you? That being out of the way, I do sympathize with you, because it is awful to be run over at every turn and not have people listen to your opinions after they have asked for them. The simple fact that they do not trust you to know your own mind _is_ distressing. Still, you ended up with the car you wanted! Now go and enjoy it! If you don't then you would really be an a**hat.", "YTA. You're not entitled to _any_ car, let alone your first choice, when someome else is paying the bill.", "I'm gonna day ESH\n\nEveryone has already hit the points about you but I do think it's not right to not take your opinions into consideration and to continue to bring it up to anyone and everyone instead of sitting and having a conversation with you and hashing it out. It's not fair to continue to drag you through the mud.", "I'm not going to pass judgement because I think others have said it enough, but I want to add something that resonates from my personal experience. Are you actually upset about the car as the end result, or are you upset because you were pushed for your opinion and it wasn't heard?\n\nI dealt with something kinda like this when I was your age, my parents bought me something expensive, a milestone gift, to acknowledge something I achieved. But the gift came right on the tails of them telling me they couldn't be there in person to see my achievement honoured and I was feeling awful, especially after I had told them how much it would mean for them to be there. I loved and appreciated the gift but I'm sure I didn't express that as well as I could have, because at the time it felt like they were buying it to make up for not being there, and I didn't care about the money or gift, I just wanted them to be present. But at 16 I didn't know how to process or articulate any of that.\n\nSo my point is, if this is just because you didn't get the car you wanted, then Y T A. But if the car doesn't actually matter, and you blew up because your parents pushed you into making a decision they wanted you to make and then expected gratitude without taking your feelings into account, then N T A.", "YTA, at the end of the day, you have the privilege of your parents:\n\n\u2022 being able to afford to buy you a car\n\n\u2022 offering you options (especially luxurious ones)\n\n\u2022 taking you to dealers to see cars\n\n\u2022 buying you a car after you threw a tamper tantrum Cus you didn\u2019t like how it looked (and oh no it has a gps)\n\nSo many kids have to help chip in for their car, get a used car or have to use a family car.

The fact they BOUGHT YOU A CAR and you acted that way says it all.

Coming up with that sort of extra money is a huge endeavor and affects finances for months if not years. Im sure you have, but if you haven't yet, I really encourage you to let them know how much you appreciate them and apologize. As a parent, I have a ton of anxiety about how well ever be able to come up with enough for the things our child needs, and a car doesn't even make that list. Regaurless about how you felt throughout the buying process, they went above and beyond for you as parents for taking you shopping in the first place and you made them feel like you didn't appreciate it.\n\nIn all situations in life: You're only the asshole until you make it right.", "YTA.

I had a coathanger to hold the bumper on...and I LOVED THAT CAR.  It was manual, and zippy with great gas milage. My friends and I lived in that thing, cruising around and sharing cds we burnt to share with each other.", "YTA \n\nBe grateful you\u2019re even getting a car that your parents are willing to pay for that actually runs well and doesn\u2019t need repairs or too much repairs. Also idk why you don\u2019t want a gps, do you plan on not driving outside of your town???? Also depending on the car the Sun roof does come with a slide cover or it comes tinted so the Sun won\u2019t be a problem. If going out with them is such a drag to look at cars do your own research and get a job and offer to pay half.", "This", "All I did was cry that I wasn't being listened to. The other cars were between $4,000 and $10,000 and my dad even tried to give me a $20,000 corvette.  Also, yk I didnt want a gps because I didnt want them to pay extra for something I didnt want (cuz that'd automatically add at least $100 or so).  Moneys not tight either.", "Not the biggest point, but if OP is getting a car at 17, they likely have a smartphone with bluetooth or capability to hook up to a car. A specific car GPS is actually a bit outdated imo.", "Tbh I understand why she was also getting fed up with being taken to these car dealerships if her parents weren\u2019t going to bother listening to her anyway. Like they may as well have just brought the car and said surprise. Calling her those names is just absolutely awful and I hope that they will apologise for this as it can be so hurtful to hear. Op definitely was out of line particularly after saying she didn\u2019t care what it was as long as it ran and then breaking down because it was the wrong colour, I can see how her parents would find this super confusing. I\u2019m fact they probably thought oh she doesn\u2019t care about it so we might as well decide for her. They need to have a conversation in actually communicating effectively with each other 100%", "Everyone here is upset about the wording of \"being dragged to see cars,\" but I'd be upset too, if my parents had kept taking my free time just to not listen to a word I say. It sounds like they were refusing to look at cars that did not have a sunroof or GPS, which would severely limit their choices. I don't blame OP for getting fed up with it all. The parents are absolute assholes for buying the car and then complaining about it. They don't realize that they highlight their own bad parenting every time they do so.", "Also everyone is conveniently ignoring how the parents keep telling everyone about how she behaved and embarrassing her in front of other relatives when the issue has already passed. Like holding a grudge against ur own child is stupid.", "But they didnt listen. They gave me the exact things I didnt want.  I wasn't even terribly picky, but they literally picked every one I said no to. Also, the other cars were between $4,000 and $10,000.  My dad tried to get me a corvette that was $20,000.  Like I said, I was wanted to be HEARD.", "What? Why? Her parents specifically took her with them to shop \u2014 implying they want her opinion on her new car. Completely reasonable. Then OP is upset they won\u2019t listen. Also a completely reasonable thing to be upset about. Did we read two different posts mate \ud83d\ude2d", "How is this not an ESH? If you were OP's parents, you would be well within your right not to buy her a car at all. But you would most definitely be a gaping AH for feigning the appearance of a caring parent by asking her what she wants while completely disregarding her. \n\nIf OP's parents just wanted to decide everything, they should have just bought it and then given it to her as is. Even if not her ideal car, OP would almost certainly feel better after that compared to being asked and then ignored. \n\nOh, and a completely separate reason in addition. If you don't think the parents doing this: \n\n>Even today, they still tall about it, and tell all our friends and family about what happened and the way I acted. Everyone thinks I'm a spoiled brat now.\n\nis completely AH behaviour as well, you're delusional.", "Absolutely spoiled and entitled. OP, do you realize how lucky you are to be given a car as a teenager?", "I don't understand a lot of the replies either tbh, like if you bought a bicycle for someone who needs a wheelchair cause they can't walk, sure it's a free gift but it shows you're not thinking about what the recipient wants", "Phones work for that though", "And you shouldn\u2019t be looking at the screen at any point while driving. That\u2019s not safe. So it doesn\u2019t matter if the car gps is bigger.", "I didn\u2019t even get that it was too expensive. Just that dad didn\u2019t want to pay $6k unless it had GPS and a sunroof.", "All the other cars were between $4,000 and $10,000 and I was even offered a $20,000 corvette.  Also, it wasn't like I was quiet about my opinions, I specifically told them what I wanted and what I didn't want, but they simply didn't listen to anything, even taking me to see cars I said no to.  It was frustrating for 3 months, before I was tired of being unheard.", "This is not normal teenage behavior. I certainly wouldn't have done this, and I would be shocked if any of my friends acted this way.", "Phones have GPS. \nAnd sunroofs are likely to fail and somewhat less safe.", "You should edit your post to put this info in because that may change what people are saying.", "Fair point but if something happens to their phone then the car GPS is a good backup.", "hijacking your comment re: parents to add that OPs dad frequently insults her and says he\u2019s waiting for her to die :S", "If you want control over the car you drive, buy your own car. If you\u2019re gifted one, even if it\u2019s not what you\u2019d have chosen, say thank you.", "And she sulked her way through the whole experience and the found one that was outside of her parents budget and threw her toys out of the pram when she couldn\u2019t have it. \n\nThey wanted her opinion, they didn\u2019t ask to be emotionally blackmailed into buying something expensive and inappropriate", "They \u201cdragged\u201d poor baby OP there. She\u2019s the victim of a free car and loving parents.", "It sounds like they showed OP a car she did like but they didn\u2019t want to buy it since it was more expensive, which resulted in OP throwing a temper tantrum since she was upset her parents wouldn\u2019t shell out 6 grand for it.\n\nIn the end OP was making a big deal out of two things, a gps and a sunroom. A gps comes in handy if OP ever wants to leave her town, she doesn\u2019t need to use it but it\u2019s a good thing to have just in case. And sunroofs can be closed, they\u2019re a nice qol that hurts no one to have. OP pitched a fit and rolled on the ground crying like a toddler over two incredibly minor things. \n\nShe claimed to not care as long as it works and is a nice color then turned around and stuck her nose up at everything that was suggested just because they had features she didn\u2019t need to use if she didn\u2019t want to, she only mention\u2019s rejecting one car because of the color so it\u2019s safe to assume as far as appearances go, the other cars were probably up to her standards.\n\nShe\u2019s spoiled and has been taught her whole life that if she cries and screams, she\u2019ll get her way and it shows big time.", "It's a fair point and I admit I was torn, but the OP's out-and-out princessiness won the crown for me.", "That's true, but often a built in GPS has a larger screen, which is safer for driving.", "Bro this should be normal adult behavior. Who doesn\u2019t get upset when people continuously ignore their preferences and their opinions? I certainly let my hurt and frustration be shown", "Just did, its crazy seeing what one tiny piece of missing information can do.", "I checked OP\u2019s past posts, and her dad specifically said he\u2019s waiting for her to \u201cend\u201d it. OP\u2019s parents are abusive and she needs to get out of there.", "Yeah but if they were gonna railroad her on what car to buy they should have just picked out a car themselves and gifted it without dragging her around and asking for her opinion they gave no shits about. I think it's kinda E S H. It depends on how much of a \"tantrum\" she threw. If she just cried out of frustration for repeatedly not being listened to when asked her opinion I can't blame her but if she threw a whole tantrum to get her way about a free car, that sucks.", "You're focusing on her - that's fine, I never said she wasn't an AH. But you, like the other commenter I replied to are ignoring the parents' assholery - that is what I'm addressing. \n\nAnd if you do want to get into OP, I do agree with you on some points but you're reading into it way more than what's there. \n\n>but they didn\u2019t want to buy it since it was more expensive\n\nUnless I missed something, nope, you're making that up. Dad just thought it was too expensive *to what he thought it was worth*, it could have been cheaper than the second car: \n\n>However, my dad didnt like the price it was going for ($6,009).\n\nYou're arguing *for* paying more for GPS? \n\n>A gps comes in handy if OP ever wants to leave her town, she doesn\u2019t need to use it but it\u2019s a good thing to have just in case.\n\nLOL it's like you've never heard of smartphones and Google Maps and the like. \n\n>And sunroofs can be closed\n\nThey're also a point of failure, increasing chances for leaks and repairs for the motor/mechanism, etc. \n\nBut honestly, I don't even care about the specifics, I'm just defending against bad points because you seem to be trying to rationalize why OP should disregard her own preferences and that's pretty much irrelevant here. Neither side acted very well, and all the YTAs are ignorantly disregarding an entire side which makes no sense to me.", "I've never had a sunroof that didn't leak. I will never buy a car with a sunroof again.", "I hope you know the other cars were between $4,000 and $10,000, so that was nothing compared to this one that I got", "OP specifically states that the things the parents wanted on the car would make it MORE expensive so it seems pretty clear to me that *OP* is the one trying to save money here, and the parents\u2019 objection to OP\u2019s preferred car had NOTHING to do with it being more expensive.", "It's a used car, just because it has more options doesn't mean that it's more expensive. That's how the used car market works, everyone sets their own price.", "> However, my dad didnt like the price it was going for ($6,009)\n\nSays right there they didn't buy it because of the price.", "They wouldn\u2019t know that, as you didn\u2019t put it in your post.", "Ik, I wanted to keep it short, which leads me to leave out probably important details."]}
