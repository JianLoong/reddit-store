I have two kids with my late husband. My soon to be MIL (who I will refer to as MIL) does not know this full context as I am a private person and am not overly close with her. He passed when I was 23 and I really only discuss his passing once I am incredibly close with someone (I have only spoken to MIL at a handful of holidays and never had a conversation that extended far beyond the basics). \n\nNow to get into this, we recently hosted our first Thanksgiving! I felt very accomplished and was excited to share this moment with my soon to be family. The only issue being that I had totally forgotten the mashed potatoes, which seemed to have MIL in a very pissy mood. Thankfully, fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister offered to go to the store to buy some instant mashed potatoes to which I was very grateful. She asked me to check in on her youngest daughter, who was in an upstairs bedroom with my kids and had been very quiet recently (moms of reddit know this is never a good thing!). I, of course, agree. I go to check on them and find them fully engrossed in Encanto. \n\nLeft sitting at the table downstairs were my soon to be MIL, FIL, BIL, fianc\u00e9, and most importantly: SIL\u2019s oldest daughter (F15). As I make my way downstairs I do note the silence at the table but don\u2019t think much of it. After the dinner, however, while everyone is leaving SIL\u2019s oldest daughter pulls me aside and asks to be speak to me. I ask her if everything is okay and she explains that while I was gone MIL made a comment something to the note of how she didn\u2019t get why fianc\u00e9 would get with someone who is already \u201cused-up\u201d and that running around with someone like that would ruin his reputation among men, along with another comment that she said she wasn\u2019t comfortable repeating, she said she wouldn\u2019t have felt right if she hadn\u2019t told me. I thanked her profusely, honestly completely in shock at what I had just heard. \n\nMIL had already left at this point, I am a very confrontational person because I believe it gets drama over with. I called her and asked her if it was true and she got really quiet before admitting that it was. She said, something along the lines of, \u201cI am glad you know how everyone feels now, I was getting tired of hiding it.\u201d When I started to cry she replied, and this is a direct quote, \u201cYou act like a slut you get treated like one.\u201d In a moment of anger I uninvited her from my my wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is very upset and is threatening to leave if I don\u2019t fix this all now. He and our friends are all calling me the Ahole, and many have been ostracizing me. I am open to criticism but I really don\u2019t think I did anything wrong.

Your fianc\u00e9 let this woman say horrible things about you in your own home, then he had the audacity to be mad at you for your reaction. I hope you kick him to the curb and find a man who not only loves you but respects you. The only people who aren't AH in this situation are you, your kids and the 15 year old. You deserve better than a 45 year old who still trips over his umbilical cord.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. MIL was way out of line, and the fact your Fianc\u00e9 did not defend you says a lot about him. I understand being a private person, but to clear this up and get it over with, I would suggest telling them about your late husband if you feel the need to defend yourself.

Yes, his mother as a raging, misogynistic asshole. But your fiance is more of a problem, because he's not only comfortable with his comments, I get the distinct impression he shares a similar opinion.

This says EVERYTHING.\n\nYou're literally the only person that isn't the asshole in this situation (and the daughter that warned you). This whole family is disgusting.\n\nAnd I don't think it's a coincidence your husband went after someone twenty years younger than he is.\n\nAlso, you said \"our friends\" but do your friends know the real story about what happened?

Sure, discuss things first but f your future husband is okay with this you know exactly what your future in this family will always be like.

You may want to leave immediately.  I don't understand how he didn't defend you. You really may want to consider leaving. That is absurd for him to not be on your side.

As others have pointed out, you have a fiance problem not a MIL problem. NTA", "NTA - looks like you have a fianc\u00e9 problem. Why didn't he stand up for you? Why is he allowing his mother to talk about you like that? I would talk to him about this seriously - you will be dealing with her for years to come and now you know he won't stop her.", "NTA.  The MIL-to-be says THAT and YOU somehow are the bad guy?   How can they possibly contort that and make it your problem?

He is obviously okay with his mother being awful to you, i would ask him why he doesnt love you enough to defend you. Where is his outrage, why is he okay with the woman he claims to love being spoken about this way? If he allows it now, he'll allow it forever. He's showing you that he expects you to let his mother call you a slut and all sorts of horrible things for the rest of your marriage with zero consequences, and that he's fine with you being hurt as long as his mother stays happy. What a coward. It doesn't matter if you had those kids with your late husband, or if you had them out of wedlock, it's still a horrible thing she said. Does he expect you to just move past this when mom finds out those kids were \"legitimate\"? Will she even bother apologizing? Is this the grandma you want for your kids? What horrible things will she say to them when you aren't around? \nDon't marry this man. Cut your losses and in a few years you'll look back and be so grateful you are free of him.", "NTA.   If he wants you to apologize after his mother called you a slut he is TA", "OMG don't marry this guy. He's shown his true colours- you will always play second fiddle to his horrible, spiteful mother. You deserve better. If you *do* want to try to fix things, I'd send a letter/email explaining about your late husband and wait for her to apologise as she should, but do you really want to be dealing with this level of crap all the way through your marriage? I'm so sorry for your loss.  NTA", "I\u2019m still stuck back on how you\u2019re too \u201cused up\u201d to marry a man about twice your age.

You also haven\u2019t shared a fairly normal part of your background with your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family\u2026that you are a widow. You can be a private person, but that shouldn\u2019t include your family-to-be.\n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH. MIL shouldn\u2019t be gossiping about you.

Sounds like someone needs to grow up a little", "What is wrong with you? This woman called her a slut behind her back and to her face and her husband did nothing to defend her. This relationship is obviously over now once OP looks through the comment section. And she does have the right to disinvite anyone she wants, especially if they viciously insult her to her face. You need serious help", "Nope. Let my family abuse me or else. Niece is a real one though", "Yep. He was at the table when MILade comments about OP being \"used up\". He let that slide. A 15 yo girl knew that those comments were wrong, but fiance was okay with them? DTMFA", "Yeah, I went back and read more carefully and I think you're right. I was just so shocked that he would let his mother call his fianc\u00e9e a slut I figured I had misread the first time!", "I think you need serious help if you think this sub is the authority on whether someone should stay with their fianc\u00e9. Your comment seems an overreaction to what I said. Are you okay? \n\n>This relationship is obviously over now once OP looks through the comment section.\n\nWhy? Because AITA has ruled it so?\n\nI'm not saying MIL shouldn't be disinvited. I'm saying she's also TA for not speaking to her fianc\u00e9 about it first. \n\n*\"Your mother completely disrespected me tonight and I don't want her at the wedding, since she disagrees with us getting married. It would be nice if you disinvited her yourself to show you support me, but if I have to contact her myself, I will.\"*\n\nMaking a unilateral decision to uninvite an in law or someone from the other person's side of the aisle doesn't bode well. OP said they're a confrontational person so I imagine it was done in the heat of the moment, but OP didn't do herself any favours by going about the disinvite this way.", "NTA. When a F15 is smarter than your fianc\u00e9, it is time to walk away. Your fianc\u00e9 either agrees with his mother or is kissing her butt. Either way, he doesn't have your back and is not standing up to his mother. \n\nSend mama's boy packing and find yourself someone worthwhile.", "Dump the finance and MIL. Keep the SIL and SIL\u2019s daughter - they are good ppl", "NTA,  so sorry you had someone make a judgement without knowing the truth.\n\nI hope you find a way through this. Not sure if your fianc\u00e9e is worth this trouble", "NTA and i think you should really really really think carefully about marrying this man because him and his mom sound like assh.....  This is red flags everywhere", "NTA. But staying with a man who has no respect for you whatsoever would make you an ahole to yourself.", "NTA, but I question whether it would be wise for you to go ahead with this marriage.   Your fianc\u00e9\u2019 is lacking in courage to stick up for you.  Best wishes on whatever you decide.  I\u2019m sorry that this whole thing happened to you.", "You need to open your eyes and grow a spine. Get out of there girl!

And your fianc\u00e9 is now mad at you ?????", "Are you sure you still want a wedding?\n\n\nI know it seems nuclear, but your MIL called you a slut and your fiance is threatening to leave if YOU don't apologise???\n\n\nWTAF?? \n\n\nDon't go to the wedding", "NTA. Huge huge huge red flag. The fact that your soon to be husband didn't even tell you, let alone have your back, about what MIL was saying is the real problem here. He doesn't respect you.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 sucks but his sister and her daughter seem ace at least", "NTA. DON'T MARRY THIS MAN. He is never going to support or defend you. He knows exactly what she called you and says he will leave if you don't shut up and take it? No. YOU deserve better. YOUR KIDS deserve better!", "ESH YTA", "You've chosen to make the most \"drama\" over being a widow of only 4 years and yet are ready to remarry already, but not share this information with your \"new family\". \n\nUltimately, none of this drama would have unfolded had you just been upfront and by not doing so look dishonest.\n\nYou then confronted her for saying what most mothers would want for their child. Not to be a single person with no children of their own and getting tied down by someone with multiple children to someone else, who they'll have to be financially responsible for. That is not an unreasonable hope for our children, to get to experience these first experiences together rather than 3rd time round, be that weddings children etc.\n\nYou purposely confronted, presumably not expecting her to say yes she did! And you've then unilaterally stated she cannot attend your marriage to her son. He quite obviously is upset and tbh I hope this makes him reconsider what could be a shotgun wedding by the sounds of it!", "Bit the fiance is 45? He's the one that is used up!", "NTA and the fact your fiance doesnt have your back says a LOT, so much you should reconsider marrying him\n\nIf we believe MILs mindset is valid then how used up is he as a 45 year old\n\nPlease please also think about the huge age gap and what it means, your fiance is alarming", "Leave him, what an unbelievable loser. Your MIL is cruel but your husband is the one really letting you down. NTA but you need to work out if you\u2019re okay with this tension for the rest of your life.", "OP NTA. Please please put your wedding on hold and have a few conversations with you fiance. Potentially counseling. Or separation. Or best consider a break or break up.\n\nI know of a couple who started their relationship with the MIL calling the wife all used up. These exact words. The husband was verbally, financially and physically abusive in the marriage.  In both the MIL and husband's minds it's totally ok to treat women as objects and sluts. Your fiance has learned from his mother it's ok to slut shame women. His mother will be the only woman he will show respect to , no one else, not even you.\n\nAs the saying goes 'when people show you who they are believe them'. This is who they are and won't ever change. If you stay in a relationship with them you will always be verbally abused, if not more. Either to your face or behind your back.\n\nKeep this in mind the niece is the only decent person there. No one else acted with common decency.\n\nEdit - MIL probably thinks her 45 year old son should marry an 18 yr old virgin.", "NTA. Please run the fuck out of there asap. If your fiance not only didn't defend you but asked you to apologize, it means he will never have your back. You got that gigantic red flag very early on. You deserve so much better.

You will find something so much better.", "Literally wtf\u2026there is no way you\u2019re the asshole and please don\u2019t marry that man DEAR GOD\ud83e\udee3", ">My fianc\u00e9 is very upset and is threatening to leave if I don\u2019t fix this all now\n\nLet the butthurt baby leave. You deserve better", "You need to apologize to yourself for almost marrying such a AH. \n\nI\u2019m guessing at 45 there\u2019s a reason he is still single between his AH attitude and mother who\u2019d want to attach themselves to that forever. \n\nNTA and marry someone who respects you and defends you.", "NTA, why is your SIL on your side, but your own fianc\u00e9 is fine on how his mum spoke to you?", "NTA. But your fiance should have had your back. I would take a hard look at marrying the fiance. You both need to sit down and have a conversation about why he didn't stand up for you.", "NTA and you need to consider that your fianc\u00e9 sat there while his mother bad mouthed you.  He is 45yrs old yet either can\u2019t stand up to his mother or else agrees with her.  You only know about it because of a very decent 15yr old.  Take note of this \ud83d\udea9 as well as the \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 of trying to make her rudeness your fault.

He is a problem in this situation too, not just your MIL. She calls you a horrible name and your fiance wants you to apologise. I agree with other redditors. You have a fiance problem.\n\nI know you love him and this will be difficult, but at his age, he isn't wise enough to stand up to his mum, and instead seems like a mommy's boy as a grown man, I would reconsider this relationship going forward.", "This. He is clearly a 45 year old, spineless, mama's boy. OP deserves so much better than someone who refuses to stand up for her and someone who would actually turn the situation around on her.\n\nOP, think hard, do you really want to tie your children to this family? If they don't respect you, then they won't respect your kids. If your fiance allows you to be treated like this, what will he allow your kids to be put through.

You need to lay off the Hallmark Movie Channel feel good movies.", "This doesn't seem like one of these weak guys who won't stand up to mommy. He completely took it out on OP and I doubt this is the first conversation that has been had behind her back.", "She didn't give husband a chance to do anything.  Look I'm not saying MIL should be invited to the wedding, I'm not even saying wedding should go ahead.  But I don't think you can unilaterally uninvite your fiance's family members to your wedding and not be an AH.", "The fianc\u00e9 who is 20 years her senior. But op is the used up one ?\ud83d\udc40 I\u2019d be asking why he\u2019s 45 and single with a mom like that", "My point", "He is a red flag and she should run", "this is a run situation", "Because of mom like that.
