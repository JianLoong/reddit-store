I have two kids with my late husband. My soon to be MIL (who I will refer to as MIL) does not know this full context as I am a private person and am not overly close with her. He passed when I was 23 and I really only discuss his passing once I am incredibly close with someone (I have only spoken to MIL at a handful of holidays and never had a conversation that extended far beyond the basics). \n\nNow to get into this, we recently hosted our first Thanksgiving! I felt very accomplished and was excited to share this moment with my soon to be family. The only issue being that I had totally forgotten the mashed potatoes, which seemed to have MIL in a very pissy mood. Thankfully, fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister offered to go to the store to buy some instant mashed potatoes to which I was very grateful. She asked me to check in on her youngest daughter, who was in an upstairs bedroom with my kids and had been very quiet recently (moms of reddit know this is never a good thing!). I, of course, agree. I go to check on them and find them fully engrossed in Encanto. \n\nLeft sitting at the table downstairs were my soon to be MIL, FIL, BIL, fianc\u00e9, and most importantly: SIL\u2019s oldest daughter (F15). As I make my way downstairs I do note the silence at the table but don\u2019t think much of it. After the dinner, however, while everyone is leaving SIL\u2019s oldest daughter pulls me aside and asks to be speak to me. I ask her if everything is okay and she explains that while I was gone MIL made a comment something to the note of how she didn\u2019t get why fianc\u00e9 would get with someone who is already \u201cused-up\u201d and that running around with someone like that would ruin his reputation among men, along with another comment that she said she wasn\u2019t comfortable repeating, she said she wouldn\u2019t have felt right if she hadn\u2019t told me. I thanked her profusely, honestly completely in shock at what I had just heard. \n\nMIL had already left at this point, I am a very confrontational person because I believe it gets drama over with. I called her and asked her if it was true and she got really quiet before admitting that it was. She said, something along the lines of, \u201cI am glad you know how everyone feels now, I was getting tired of hiding it.\u201d When I started to cry she replied, and this is a direct quote, \u201cYou act like a slut you get treated like one.\u201d In a moment of anger I uninvited her from my my wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is very upset and is threatening to leave if I don\u2019t fix this all now. He and our friends are all calling me the Ahole, and many have been ostracizing me. I am open to criticism but I really don\u2019t think I did anything wrong.

Your fianc\u00e9 let this woman say horrible things about you in your own home, then he had the audacity to be mad at you for your reaction. I hope you kick him to the curb and find a man who not only loves you but respects you. The only people who aren't AH in this situation are you, your kids and the 15 year old. You deserve better than a 45 year old who still trips over his umbilical cord.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. MIL was way out of line, and the fact your Fianc\u00e9 did not defend you says a lot about him. I understand being a private person, but to clear this up and get it over with, I would suggest telling them about your late husband if you feel the need to defend yourself.

Yes, his mother as a raging, misogynistic asshole. But your fiance is more of a problem, because he's not only comfortable with his comments, I get the distinct impression he shares a similar opinion.

This says EVERYTHING.\n\nYou're literally the only person that isn't the asshole in this situation (and the daughter that warned you). This whole family is disgusting.\n\nAnd I don't think it's a coincidence your husband went after someone twenty years younger than he is.\n\nAlso, you said \"our friends\" but do your friends know the real story about what happened? I have a feeling your husband is lying to make himself and his mother look like the victims.", "NTA. But i think the more pressing issue here is not the MIL but your soon to be husband.

Sure, discuss things first but f your future husband is okay with this you know exactly what your future in this family will always be like. Think about how that woman and her family will treat your kids.", "NTA, I'm rarely in favor of the \"uninvite from my wedding\" posts because they're usually petty, but what your MIL said was awful, and the fact that she said it in front of your fiance and he took her side is terrible.", "NTA. You may want to leave immediately.  I don't understand how he didn't defend you. You really may want to consider leaving. That is absurd for him to not be on your side.

NTA.", "NTA. & not sure if you wanna be part of that family. Sounds like the in-law\u2019s kids are treating you better than the parents or even you\u2019re fianc\u00e9.", "NTA and your future husband needs to be in your camp with this one or he never will be.

As others have pointed out, you have a fiance problem not a MIL problem. NTA", "NTA - looks like you have a fianc\u00e9 problem. Why didn't he stand up for you? Why is he allowing his mother to talk about you like that? I would talk to him about this seriously - you will be dealing with her for years to come and now you know he won't stop her.", "NTA.  The MIL-to-be says THAT and YOU somehow are the bad guy?   How can they possibly contort that and make it your problem?

He is obviously okay with his mother being awful to you, i would ask him why he doesnt love you enough to defend you. Where is his outrage, why is he okay with the woman he claims to love being spoken about this way? If he allows it now, he'll allow it forever. He's showing you that he expects you to let his mother call you a slut and all sorts of horrible things for the rest of your marriage with zero consequences, and that he's fine with you being hurt as long as his mother stays happy. What a coward. It doesn't matter if you had those kids with your late husband, or if you had them out of wedlock, it's still a horrible thing she said. Does he expect you to just move past this when mom finds out those kids were \"legitimate\"? Will she even bother apologizing? Is this the grandma you want for your kids? What horrible things will she say to them when you aren't around? \nDon't marry this man. Cut your losses and in a few years you'll look back and be so grateful you are free of him.", "NTA.   If he wants you to apologize after his mother called you a slut he is TA", "OMG don't marry this guy. He's shown his true colours- you will always play second fiddle to his horrible, spiteful mother. You deserve better. If you *do* want to try to fix things, I'd send a letter/email explaining about your late husband and wait for her to apologise as she should, but do you really want to be dealing with this level of crap all the way through your marriage? I'm so sorry for your loss.  NTA", "I\u2019m still stuck back on how you\u2019re too \u201cused up\u201d to marry a man about twice your age.  NTA but you may in fact be a fool to want to stay", "This situation and everyone in it is toxic to you and your children.\n\nBut info: why are you willing to confront rather than to speak your truth?", "Look, you are dating a man nearly 20 years your senior. You also haven\u2019t shared a fairly normal part of your background with your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family\u2026that you are a widow. You can be a private person, but that shouldn\u2019t include your family-to-be.\n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH. MIL shouldn\u2019t be gossiping about you.
