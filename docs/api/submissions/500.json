A small birthday celebration with presents and cake etc. All good right. \n\nAfter being on implant birth control for 7.5 years, my bf and I decided it was time to give my body a break with the hormones. I got my implant removed early. 6 weeks later he got a vasectomy. I got pregnant. We found out when I was 12 weeks pregnant. \n\nIt\u2019s been 8 days exactly that I haven\u2019t had my baby.

It's sounds like you're just both processing your grief differently. Neither way is right or wrong, the most important thing is to communicate with each other and to not judge how the other is handling their emotions.", "NAH.\n\n>My bf is putting all his attention into his son. Maybe that\u2019s his way of grieving, idk. But it makes me feel like our child together didn\u2019t matter. \n\nYou are likely right that this is how he grieves, but it certainly doesn't mean your child together doesn't matter. Do (or don't do) what you need to   do for your grief. If that means avoiding big groups, celebrating kids, that's okay. Take care if yourself and I'm sorry for your loss.", "NAH. It's still his son's birthday. He cant stop caring about his son and making sure he has a good birthday. Doesn't mean the baby you lost is any less important. People deal with things differently and you'd only known 2 weeks it sounds like? That is a LOT of things to process in that amount of time. For both of you. I can see him being upset not being there for his kid's birthday. What if was your 11 year old's birthday? Would you not celebrate it either? But I can also see needing to not be in that environment. Hopefully they can get you in to see someone soon", "NAH but talk about this so it doesn't become an issue between you.", "NTA. You are grieving and each person prices differently. Cut yourself some slack and keep seeking the help you need.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You\u2019ve experienced an extremely traumatic, life-changing event and it\u2019s completely understandable to feel as you do.", "Clarification needed please:\n\nSo you have a son from a different father?\nHe has a son from a different mother? \n\nYou and he had a 12wk fetus and lost the potential baby?\n\n So you have severe depression and don't want to go with the boys to the animal farm birthday party?\n\nHe doesn't understand that you're still emotionally attached to the lost child or the eldest son? \n\nI am not sure who \"our child together \" is.\n\nIt sounds like this was an unplanned pregnancy. He didn't particularly want another child since he did get a vasectomy.  \n\nHe seems focused on his son, great, I hope he treats your eldest son just as well. \n\nHe is TA for ignoring your severely declining mental health, physical changes to your body, and demanding your attention. \n\nIs a 12wk unborn child a person to him? It clearly is to you, so you're grieving the loss. If he doesn't have the same belief as you maybe it's time to re-evaluate him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He has a son from a previous relationship. \nWe had a 14 week baby together that we no longer have. \nHe wants us to be a family and celebrate all together for his sons birthday. \nNeither of us wanted anymore children. It was unplanned. 6 weeks from my implant being removed to his vasectomy. I grew attached. We only knew for a little over 2 weeks but I was getting excited.", "Your grief is valid but why do you want to punish your boyfriend\u2019s kid? Have you given a single thought to the fact you suddenly wanting nothing to do with him will probably hurt him deeply?", "I am sorry for your loss. Your baby is your baby no matter what anyone says. \n\nIt still sounds to me like he just wants to pretend that the last 14 weeks didn't happen. So, he is deciding to put his son first. \n\nYou really need to talk with him and be on the same page about this grief. This can snowball into a bigger, end of relationship type of thing.\n\nIt seems like there are several possible scenarios:\n\nHe's grieving in his own way, so he's forcing you to act like a united front for his/his son's benefit\n\nHe's doesn't care, and has already moved on.\n\nHe's secretly glad that you two aren't having a baby together. \n\n\n\nOr maybe none of these are quite right and you need professional help both individually and as a couple. Caretaker burnout is a thing too. The normal accepted grieving period is about 1 year. Post partum depression can range from mild to severe. \n\nIn order to be a real family, you and he have to work through this tough time together. No where have you mentioned how he has supported you throughout all of this. You have offered to make his son's birthday special, but when you need Mommy time. He gets upset at you? \n\nYou need to take care of yourself to take care of the boys! Your man needs to take care of you! \n\nYour bf is TA and you have misplaced guilt over someone else's child's Temporary happiness over your long term health. \n\nI hope you give yourself all the time that you need to heal from this , no matter anyone else's expectations"]}
