You would be stepping outside for a moment. There's nothing rude about that, especially if you just go quietly.\n\nI lost my father nearly 10 years ago, and I would still struggle watching a father-daughter dance. Grief is like that. You aren't making the moment \"about you\". You are planning to let them have their moment. We can't turn our feelings off just because others might find them inconvenient. I think your plan is very good.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA \n\n\nFirstly, your colleague is a massive AH. Just putting that out there. Anyone who sees wedding etiquette as more important than literal life and death is just plain wrong.\n\n\nWith that said, you wouldn't be an AH for not witnessing your friends dance for any reason. Even if it was because you received an important call at the time, its not mandatory to witness every event at a wedding. The point of the dance is for your friend to share a moment with her Dad, not for you to witness it. \n\n\nLastly, my sincere condolences on losing your Dad. I lost mine last year and it just plain sucks. Do whatever you need to do to get through this shitty shitty time. I couldn't be there for that dance either xx", "NTA. Don\u2019t ask permission, just go. She will be doing her thing and you do yours. Then rejoin the party. It\u2019s 100% ok. \n\nReally sorry about the loss of your dad. Sending you big hugs!", "Explain the situation to your friend. If she doesn't understand she's the asshole\n\nNta OP", "NTA, quietly popping out doesn't make the wedding about you. Making a big scene and crying in front of everyone is what makes it about you, which isn't part of the plan, so your wedding-obsessed colleague is just wrong and un-empathetic.\n\nIf it'll make you upset and it's a bit much to handle so soon after losing your dad, you should be free to leave and get some air. No one has to know. My condolences.", "NTA. Privately removing yourself (your husbands idea is a good one) is NOT making it all about you. It's the considerate way to keep the focus on the wedding party. \n\nYour colleague is wrong, and your husbands idea is perfect.", "NTA - I think that if you sneak out quietly for a short time, nobody will even notice.  Just say you need to use the bathroom or something if anyone asks.  Don't mention your issues to anyone else at the wedding.", "NTA, at weddings people miss bits for various things, call a babysitter, use the bathroom, go out to smoke, etc. If you discreetly step out it's unlikely anyone would notice. Unless you're in the bridal party or it's a really small wedding, no need to mention it.", "YWNBTA. How close to the bride are you, if you're very close, just tell her. If you're not terribly close, nobody will even notice", "NTA. \n\nInfo: how close are you to the bride? I am sure if you explained that you need to step outside for a few minutes because you\u2019re grieving and this will be hard for you, she will understand. \n\nTo be clear - I don\u2019t think you need to give anyone an explanation for stepping outside for a few mins. But maybe having your friend understand and support you will help you.", "NTA\n\nIt will actually be pretty easy to sneak out. In fact, nobody will be watching you, they\u2019ll be watching the bride. People will come and go from the main hall the whole time.", "NTA. Noone is going to be looking at you, all eyes will be on the bride dancing. Even if she noticed ( I highly doubt it) your friend will understand- anyone else there who doesn't, can suck it. NTA", "NTA, talk to your friend directly, explain the situation and why you need to pop out. I\u2019m sure, if she\u2019s a good friend, she\u2019ll understand.", "NTA at all.  You\u2019re not making it about yourself if you don\u2019t draw attention to slipping out. You\u2019re just taking care of yourself.", "NTA. Quietly slipping away is no problem. Hell for all anyone knows you're heading to the bathroom because you need to pee.", "NTA and to be honest I doubt people will even notice", "Absolutely NTA\u2026 you should be able to tell when the DJ is about to start the partner dances, just get up then and casually head out.  No one will notice because they\u2019ll all be focused on the dance floor.", "Unless you're planning on storming out of the room shouting \"I'm leaving!\" NTA - it's OK to take yourself outside for a bit, to have a breath of fresh air, it's no big deal. Don't outright tell anyone why you're doing it or they might blow it up into a Thing for drama, but weddings are loud and busy, anyone might need to step out for a minute.\n\nIt's not the same, but I'm autistic and was MOH at my sister's wedding earlier this year, and zero people noticed the bit where I slipped away for ten minutes for a bit of a recharge. Especially during that dance too, no one's going to be looking at you (no offence!) You can be there for your friend and look after yourself at the same time, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Breaking down and being overcome by grief would be way worse and it would distract everyone from the bride.\n\nOrdinarily I would say just tell the bride you need to quietly duck out for a moment and she should understand, no one's paying attention to the wedding party during that dance anyway. However, weddings seem to break people's ability to think rationally \u2013 as evidenced by your colleague \u2013 so maybe ask the maid of honour first, depending on how well you know her or the bride.\n\nAlso am I the only who finds father-daughter dances extraordinarily creepy?", "NTA", "NTA. Also, my condolences for your loss.", "NTA But it does depend on the format of the wedding and layout to some extent. It could be the first dance, then followed by parent dances, with you being seated on the far side of the ballroom.", "NTA.", "Thank you so much, the same colleague also called me the AH for having a small wedding (literally two witnesses and no party) for the same reason. I couldn't face having a proper one without my dad. Her calling me out has made me second guess things I suppose. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss as well.", "Thank you.", "I think my friend would understand, we've been close since we were kids. I haven't wanted to tell her though because I don't want her to notice. My colleague surprises me with her opinions sometimes.", "Thank you.\n\nAnd gosh, making a scene is quite far from the way I operate, I like to blend into the background.", "I'm very close with the bride, we're childhood friends. I wouldn't want to mention it to her though because I wouldn't want my grief to bring her down on her big day.  I'm sure if I did mention it, she'd be understanding.  I thought slipping out without being noticed was the best bet, my colleague has some strange opinions on things and I guess she just gets into my head sometimes.", "That's what I thought, my colleague has some strange opinions. I used to call her a friend as well but conversations like these make me realise she doesn't really care about me as a person.", "Your colleague is the ass here, not you. She is way too invested in how you live your life and handle your grief.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss.", "Well, you did say your colleague is \"wedding obsessed\". She's welcome to her opinions...two cents doesn't buy much these days, so take it for what it's worth.", "I don't think you'd have to tell her anything beforehand. Just meander over towards the door before the dancing starts and slip out. She will be busy with it all and probably won't even notice. Even if she does, if she's a friend, she will understand when you explain later - if she even asks. She might not even bring it up.", "If she is a childhood friend she would never misunderstand you. I am sure she would be understanding. Ignore your coworker. You\u2019re most certainly not an AH for wanting to slip out for a few mins. \n\nI am extremely sorry for your loss.", "Thank you."]}
