You would be stepping outside for a moment. There's nothing rude about that, especially if you just go quietly.\n\nI lost my father nearly 10 years ago, and I would still struggle watching a father-daughter dance. Grief is like that. You aren't making the moment \"about you\". You are planning to let them have their moment. We can't turn our feelings off just because others might find them inconvenient. I think your plan is very good.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA \n\n\nFirstly, your colleague is a massive AH. Just putting that out there. Anyone who sees wedding etiquette as more important than literal life and death is just plain wrong.\n\n\nWith that said, you wouldn't be an AH for not witnessing your friends dance for any reason. Even if it was because you received an important call at the time, its not mandatory to witness every event at a wedding. The point of the dance is for your friend to share a moment with her Dad, not for you to witness it. \n\n\nLastly, my sincere condolences on losing your Dad. I lost mine last year and it just plain sucks. Do whatever you need to do to get through this shitty shitty time. I couldn't be there for that dance either xx", "NTA.

Breaking down and being overcome by grief would be way worse and it would distract everyone from the bride.\n\nOrdinarily I would say just tell the bride you need to quietly duck out for a moment and she should understand, no one's paying attention to the wedding party during that dance anyway.

I'm juggling my infant so I'm not getting to reply to people as quickly as I'd like so I thought I'd post this comment showing my appreciation. It's been an impossibly hard journey of grief but the support in this comment section is really nice to read.", "NTA. I was a bridesmaid a month after my dad's sudden passing and I cried (not making-a-scene-crying, but still crying) during the ceremony and decided I couldn't do the reception at all. I've left all kinds of things quietly when I felt overwhelmed. I don't understand how anyone wouldn't get that.", "Just use the restroom or step outside during the song and likely no one will even notice.  What will cause a stir is you broadcasting that you need to excuse yourself and why.  \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDo you suddenly have to go to the toilet just between the first dance and the father daughter dance? You were drinking a lot of water through dinner.", "NTA\n\nLeave quietly and return when you feel you're ok to do it.\n\n\nIn a lighter (hopefully not offensive) way, if you had to really really go pee during the dance? Would you pee yourself just no to leave the moment?\n\nI'm not married, but my friends and family that talked about that moment they were focused on that moment and wouldn't even have noticed if a couple of gests left.", "NTA My father died in 2012 and I quietly stepped out during the father/daughter dance of the two weddings I attended over the next 4 years. I have not been to another one since, so who knows how I would be today. It\u2019s hard. \n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Ugly crying in the corner? Quietly step away, you\u2019ll probably be aware the dance is about to happen and might be able to sneak out a few minutes prior, so if anyone sees you, they may not even make the connection.", "NTA, but if you're really worried just talk to your friend about it and explain why you'd rather step out for those few minutes.  If she's a good friend she'll understand and have no problem with it.", "NTA If you pop out for air, nobody will ever know. Nobody is keeping tabs on others during the wedding party. I left a wedding to take a time out for 40 minutes in my hotel room. Not even my husband noticed that I was gone. Everyone assumed that I was hanging with someone else.", "NTA- Stepping out for some air is a great idea, What a thoughtful husband. I lost my father this year so I understand the grief :(. You do what makes you comfortable. I'm positive no one will notice", "NTA - but the dark cloud following you and breastfed infant comments make me seriously worried for your health.  Please follow up with a therapist, the combination of postpartum depression plus this loss might be more damaging than you can imagine now!", "My dad died when I was 16. At almost every wedding I\u2019ve ever been to, I find that I always need to go to the bathroom right when it\u2019s time for the father daughter dance. \n\nNTA, OP, and I\u2019m sorry you had to join the \u201cmy dad died\u201d club.", "This is the best response. I lost my dad almost 3 years ago now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to handle it either. Your husband\u2019s suggestion is great and I\u2019m so glad you have someone who is supportive going with you. If your friend even notices she\u2019ll probably understand. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. NTA", "Thank you, and I'm sorry for your loss as well. It's the type of pain that's indescribable until you go through it, I don't think I'll ever be the same again.", "I had a friend step out during my father-daughter dance to have a quick cry. Her dad has been gone for over 15 years. She was crying because she never got that moment with her own dad and because she was happy that I did get that moment with mine. And my response to this (after I found out later, I absolutely didn't notice in the moment) was to hug her and say I was sorry for her loss and thank her for her happiness for me. Your friend is out of line and you are NTA.", "Your friend will not even notice.", "I 'suddenly had to go to the bathroom' during the father daughter dance at weddings for several years after my dad died, and anyone who noticed was very understanding. Presumably your friend knows your situation and wouldn't be bothered if you suddenly had to use the restroom, too. \n\nIf you're really bothered by it, you could always talk to her or a mutual friend about it before the wedding. But whatever you do, stop listening to your idiot coworker and talk to people who care more about people than events.", "Your colleague sounds insufferable. She\u2019s not wedding obsessed, she\u2019s rude and intrusive. \n\nYour wedding was none of her business. \n\nIf you announced, on the mic from the DJ booth, that you were leaving your friend\u2019s wedding because you are grieving, then that would be totally unacceptable. Stepping out of the room for five minutes for any reason is totally normal and fine. Or does your colleague think wedding guests aren\u2019t allowed to nip to the loo or pop outside for a smoke during the day/evening?\n\nNTA but it\u2019s best to avoid this person going forwards. You had no reason to share this info with her. Keep talk superficial and work related in future. That way you won\u2019t have to listen to her nonsense.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Stop talking to this person honey. They aren't worth your time.", "Damn why do you ask this lady anything? She sounds horrible.", "I promise that not one person will notice your bathroom break during a 3 minute song.", "I'm sorry for your loss, it's an awful club to be in.", "So background to this was that our only witnesses were supposed to be my brother, and my husband's brother. We wanted to get married at that time because our baby was on the way and it was just easier. I didn't invite my in-laws at all because I didn't want it to be like a proper wedding (I couldn't face it without my dad so we just wanted the legal stuff sorted), and my mum wasn't up to social events. Turns out my in-laws invited themselves anyway, so my mum came along too. My colleague said to me, that if she were my in-laws, she would never speak to me again. I'm still not sure if I'm TA in this. Tbh I've been tempted to post an AITA on this encounter as well.", "Thank you. I have added little extra context on that in the comment above and I'm really not sure if I'm TA in that situation. I'm debating putting up another post about it tbh.", "I used to consider her a friend but yeah I agree with you, she makes odd comments like this regularly, I'm just not used to losing friends so it plays on my mind. She's a born-again Christian and mentioned something about our unborn baby going to hell as well. I really should have cut ties at that point tbh.", "[removed]", "You are not an asshole for this either.\n\nYour colleague is a TREMENDOUS asshole who has clearly never suffered a loss.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
