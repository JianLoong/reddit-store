It's only been 2 weeks, that's a blip when it comes to losing a parent and grief. That is no time at all. You definitely need to be stepping up for her and your younger children will be fine, obviously you care about all of them. \n\nAnna needs to realize all your children matter.", "NTA. Your wife is likely projecting her feelings onto your children. They are not at three and five years old coming to her and saying that they think you should spend more time with them. They might mention they miss you, or ask where you are, but those should be easily managed moments given the circumstances and previous conversations you\u2019ve had with them (at least the 5 year old). There is an undertone of possible manipulation here that is very concerning.\n\nEditing to add: please keep in mind that what is happening in the lives of your three and five year-old right now, while important, will not be remembered by them. Absolutely everything about this period of time will be forever etched in the memory of your oldest.", "NTA. Wow your wife needs a reality check. That girl just lost her mum and she\u2019s getting annoyed because you\u2019re giving her extra attention? Wow", "As long as you aren't spending no time with your younger kids, NTA.  Jo needs extra attention right now. Not forever- just for this little bit.\n\nThat said- you need to talk to your wife. Let her know what you are doing. What is going on. Because even if 90% of your attention is on your daughter, your wife and other kids to need some attention each day.\n\nbut a lot of this is on Anna, she needs to understand that right now Jo needs to be your priority so that you need Anna to make sure that the little kids don't go looking for you when you are with Jo. The kids won't think they are missing out so much if they're doing something else- whether that's playing with mom or out at a play date.", "NTA. I was leaning towards NAH because grief sucks and can affect everyone. HOWEVER, the way your wife is handling it makes her the AH. Yes, you are less attentive with the other children, but you explained to them in the most kid-friendly way, and they seem to understand. \n\nYour boys have their mother still and Jo does not. She can show some empathy to her step daughter.", "NTA.\n\nI would just ask Anna how she would feel if the situation was flipped. If she had died, would she expect you to spend more time with the younger kids while they grieve? I don't think it's more difficult than that.", "NTA your wife needs a reality check and to be more understanding. \n\nMaybe to compromise you can try and do things with all 3 of your kids.", "NTA, sounds like this is probably coming from your wife more than your kids.", "Your wife is a major AH. Pay close attention, she may turn on Jo if she hasn't already.", "NTA Jos mum just died, does your wife not get that? Her kids still have both parents. Jo just has you. Of course you\u2019re going to give her more emotional support just now", "NTA\n\nJo just lost her mom at a very young age, that's so tough for anyone to go through. You're doing what's necessary by looking after her, checking if she's alright, and finding a therapist for her. You even told m5 and f3 about the situation in a way they could understand, even if it saddens them a little. Anna's frustration is understandable but should not be directed at you, or anyone.\n\nYou're a good father, and you should be proud.", "This is insane. Of course your oldest needs you more right now. Your wife should never have thought to bring this up to you. No way a 3 year old complained about this, and I highly doubt a 5 year old would either. Your wife should have just said your sister is having a rough time and she needs all of us right now, then take them to the park or get ice cream. A 3 and 5 year old would be quite happy with that. I think the wife is jealous. Did Jo live with you before her mom passed? Also I\u2019m sorry for your loss and having to watch your child go through such heartbreak. NTA but I think your wife may be.", "NAH. I think you explained it to your kids in an age-appropriate way and your wife is going to be approaching asshole territory if she doesn't understand why Jo needs extra attention.

In life bad stuff happens. We rely on our partners to support us in those times within reason. If this happened to my partner, I would be extending every effort to make sure they could give their child the support they need.\n\nIt sounds like your wife is not up for this, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she were projecting her feelings onto your two young ones.\n\nObviously your plan of giving your oldest your 100% exclusive attention is not feasible forever, but it is crucial right now.\n\nYour wife needs to suck it up and take the bulk of the responsibility for the other two during this difficult time.", "NTA at all. It sounds like Anna is feeling jealous and is using the children\u2019s confusion as an excuse - she feels insecure and that you and Jo grieving her mom means you still had feelings for her or Anna is not a good enough stepmom. Children, even young ones, can understand that someone needs extra comfort when they are sad and this is temporary as Jo works through her grief. But Anna\u2019s insecurities are wayyy low on the list of priority and she\u2019s an asshole for arguing this when your 15 year old lost her mother TWO WEEKS ago. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "The only AH here is \"Anna\". Sorry (not sorry).", "NTA Anna is jealous. Keep giving Jo the attention she needs right now.", "NTA and Anna seems jealous somehow. She needs to learn this is an incredibly difficult time for Jo, and it won\u2019t change any time soon. Also, my condolences to you and Jo, I wish you the very best.", "NTA. Your daughter's mom died only weeks around and Anna's already acting like a wicked stepmother\n\nMy own stepmom would probably tear Anna to shreds over her behavior", "NTA where is Anna's empathy for your grieving child??", "NTA your daughter lost her mom only 2 weeks ago! Yes, she needs you more. And the little ones likely won't even remember in a few years. And if they do, you explain it.", "NTA 2 weeks is fresh, you're right to help your eldest daughter out. Your other kids are young so I empathize with spouse wanting help again, but this isn't exactly a usual time or something unimportant you're out for.", "NTA. Your wife is completely out of line right now. Your eldest lost her mom two weeks ago and this is how she reacts?? Your 3 and 5 year old might want and need a bit of daddy time and I think you have to have to put in a little more effort by maybe getting them up in the mornings for a little extra time or spending a little extra time during their bedtimes, but your eldest kid's mental and emotional state is extremely fragile right now. By the way, is she even trying to extend herself any to help Jo? Perhaps even taking on a bit more of the load with the younger kids? I'm guessing not. \n\nIf your wife hasn't been acting as the evil stepmother before, is it only because Jo wasn't with you full time? Is she going to be living with you full time now? If so, you need to keep a keen eye out on any attempt to abuse or demean your kid from this point forward. It needs to be made clear that any attempts to treat Jo as an outsider or usurper or unwanted in the 'family' will be your hill for you and this marriage to die on.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re right - Jo needs you a lot right now. Your wife is also right - your little ones need stability right now. \n\nThe younger ones can\u2019t fully comprehend what is going on with Jo. All they\u2019re really experiencing is less time with dad. \n\nWhat routines do you normally do with the kids? Keep those routines. \n\nIf you\u2019re usually responsible for say, baths before bed - don\u2019t bail on that routine. \n\nKeep the routine activities that ensure your little ones feel safe and loved. But they will be fine with less interactive play time with dad right now when they know you\u2019re helping Jo.", "NTA", "NTA. It makes *total* sense that Jo needs more time with you right now, and it's good that you tried to explain it to the littles in a way they could understand. You're being a good dad by giving Jo the attention she needs while dealing with a loss of this magnitude. It's kind of shocking how little compassion your wife has for her, and hope that this attitude doesn't pervade into the way she speaks to Jo.", "Your wife is jealous (shocker i know)\n\ndoes it really surprise anyone with these posts, that the people involved dont actually love their step children?", "NAH - You are devoting more time to one and the other kids noticed. We rely on our partner to  see a bigger picture. You are not doing anything wrong nor is Anna. Rely on each other through this grieving period. \n\nConsider carving out 2 hours or so for the younger ones (playground visit, bubbles fun).", "NTA.  Anna needs to put in some overtime for her job as a test pilot at the broom factory if she can't understand that Jo needs extra attention after her mom died.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like a horrible, self-centred person.", "NTA,  you are being a wonderful father, providing grief support for your daughter, who lost her mother. Your wife, on the other hand, is being a huge. AH. Understanding that your daughter needs a little extra of your time, it seems that your wife could pick up a little of the slack with your other children. It also might be a really good idea for her to spend some extra time with your daughter and let her know she\u2019s willing to help out as a mother figure if she needs it or wants it.", "NTA, it'd be one thing if you were doing it for a year but it's only been two weeks. Your wife is overreacting.", "NTA, but your wife is being incredibly selfish and cruel. Is it the attention taken away from the kids she is upset about, or is it actually the attention taken away from her? She honestly sounds like a Disney evil stepmother. Be honest, how do they get along otherwise?", "Is this for real?  Is your wife a Disney villain?  Because there is no way anyone outside of the wicked step mother schtick would dare suggest that a father spend less time with his child TWO WEEKS after her mother's passing.  This precious girl just lost 50% of her parental love and your wife is suggestion she receive LESS time and love now?  As a step mother I think this would be the PERFECT opportunity for her to show you her love for you and for your daughter by stepping up and taking over some of your parental duties for the younger two so that you could focus on giving your daughter what she needs.  Because what she most certainly NEEDS is love, support, and attention.  What she does NOT need is to feel like she is being abandoned by both of her parents.  One she lost to tragedy and could not have been avoided, but make no mistake if she loses you to your wife's petty jealousy then that is a choice you will be making, and will deserve any consequences that come your way.  It will also send a crystal clear message how unimportant she is to you.\n\nNo parent should EVER allow someone to come in between them and their child.  And no parent should ever ask that of another parent.  YWBTA.  It is your fatherly DUTY to protect your daughter from harm, and your wife is blatantly harming your daughter on several levels just to satisfy her own ego.  If it had been her that passed would she dare to suggest that you spend less time with your younger children?  I'm willing to bet she would not.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your wife is struggling with the shift in priorities. It's temporary, but I'm sure she is scared that it isn't. It also sounds like you did the best you could communicating with the kids.\n\nA couple of points though. First, did you communicate the change to your wife as well as you did to your kids? You didn't mention it, and perhaps that's where her hurt is coming from. Ideally she would understand and make the sacrifice, but you might need to communicate a bit more on your end. It couldn't hurt.\n\nSecond, is there any way you could invite your younger kids into the time you spend with Jo? It might not be easy at two weeks, but over the next couple of months it could be an opportunity to explain to them what it means to love and be there for family.", "NTA. Jo really needs you right now more than ever and you absolutely need to be there for her.\n\nSince you never had problems before I will assume Anna is otherwise reasonable. Her insecurities may be coming out here, causing her to lash out a bit. Or perhaps she feels overwhelmed having to take on more childcare responsibilities for toddlers. It also may be that she is the one feeling like you\u2019re never around lately and she misses you but is blaming it on the kids. Maybe tell her something like \u201cI know this is really tough on you too, with me not being around as much. I really appreciate your understanding and patience right now, and I could never do all this without you.\u201d", "NTA and your wife is already showing red flags. Look into your own therapy to help with becoming her sole parent and to get help with navigating your new dynamic I have seen many people looking for advice in similar situations (a single older child from a previous relationship looses second parent) and it's a complicated thing. Getting family therapy to get everyone on the same page is likely to be the best option to lay a good foundation and boundaries for the rest of your lives together.", "NTA. Her mom JUST DIED. I'd be looking askance at Anna.", "\"all\" your attention, then yeah, AH, but a lot of or most of it not an AH.\n\nYou have 3 kids and while it's normal to give one going through something like this most of your attention, you have a responsibility to all 3.", "NAH\n\n But if you start favoring your oldest you would be. The younger kids are 5 and 3, they won't understand why they are left aside.", "NAH. It\u2019s understandable that Jo needs you more but you need to keep communicating with your younger kids that you haven\u2019t stopped spending time with them because of something they did or because you don\u2019t want to, but because Jo lost her mom and need you more. I get that some people here think 5 year olds have the intelligence of an infant and won\u2019t notice you aren\u2019t spending time with them but the average 5 year old is smarter than that. Talk to them instead of them crying to your wife about it.", "NTA.  It's been two weeks, not months.   And I assume you ate sttil engaging with your younger kids? Just taking more time to talk to and be with your oldest.  Especially if you are struggling to find a therapist.   Maybe talk to the wife more about what is really going on.

Absolutely everything about this period of time will be forever etched in the memory of your oldest.\n\nThey might not actively remember the time, but these are actually the most crucial years (until 5) for their development (brain, trust, safety etc), it also affects what kind of relationships you'll have as an adult. So what you say and do in these years is extremely important. And while they might understand the words their father said they might not fully comprehend what it means or why it is important (especially the 3 year old one).\n\nTry to get at least a little bit of quality time each day with them OP (even just 20 minute before bed-time so they don't feel pushed aside). Obviously what \"Jo\" goes through is horrible and she needs you. This will require some serious amount balancing from your side, but I don't think a couple of minutes each day are unreasonable. Good luck OP.", "Agree.\n\nAlso not remembering doesn't equal no effect. You don't remember what it was like to be a baby, but what happened in that time (especially until 5 years old) shapes your future, your relationships, your self-esteem.\n\nIt is crucial OP finds a balance to spend some time with the other 2 kids as well, without neglecting his older daughter, who obviously needs him a lot right now. \n\nBut saying this will have zero effect on the younger kids because \"they won't remember\" is wrong.", "And what the stepmother does to help the situation or not help the situation will have a huge effect on all three kids as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey need to get on the same page.", "The question literally says he's communicated with them about why he's spending more time with Jo and that he is spending time with them.", "Yes the kid is confused and extra needy. But does it really means that just because he\u2019s younger he\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d trump over older kid needs? \nAs much as the wife have empathy for her kids she should have at least half for grieving teen that just lost her mom. \nNormally yes kids noticed it. But in this situation op explained. And for fuck sake it\u2019s been only 2 weeks. Like seriously the  wife is at least selfish here bordering evil. Op should ask if it was her that died should he abandon kids that he have with her, because his oldest also wants time with him. \nOP is absolutely NTA here and best father he can be. If it was half a year maybe. But two weeks?"]}
