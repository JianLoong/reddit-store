My parents live in another part of the state, and I don't see them often, so I ran it by Chris and we made plans.\n\nThe restaurant was a new seafood place that opened close to where we live. Since I knew how picky Chris can be, I asked him to look over the menu before we went so that we could make sure there would be something there that he'd eat. He told me he looked it over and would have the salmon.\n\nFast forward to this evening, when we all sat down to eat and he made a disgusted face looking at the menu. I asked what was wrong and he told me there's nothing he'd eat. My parents looked a bit hurt, so I pulled Chris aside and said that I couldn't believe he'd do this, that if he wouldn't like the food he had all of yesterday and most of today to pick a different restaurant. I then commented that I was just annoyed by his picky eating because now it's hurting my parents, and left the restaurant with him(after apologizing to my parents).\n\nHe told me that he was in shock that I didn't defend him and that I \"should have known\" he would be unhappy, and was being a total AH for publicly humiliating \"what he can't control\".\n\nAITA?\n\nQuick edit about the salmon: I had asked him about that, and I guess the problem is he read the menu again and saw how it was prepared, like he didn't care for the seasoning that was going to be on the salmon.\n\n**Edit**: oh geez, this started blowing up far more than I expected.

Does your bf have brain damage or a memory disability? If he actually did say he'd have salmon and then got all mad because there's nothing to eat, that's some kind of weirdo abuse tactic there.

He has three kids and none of them will eat the same meal. His wife and my MIL just martyr themselves to the little princes' whims.

He ruined my birthday with my parents. Your bf sounds annoying. I would've sent him home and eaten dinner though.", "NTA\n\nHe was upset by the seasoning? Then tell them to not add it. He is acting like a child.", "NTA.  That's incredibly manipulative and honestly seems like a big red flag.  As you said, he had all the time in the world to say something before hand and even looked at the menu.  He likely went in there knowing he'd do this.", "NTA. But why are you enabling this? he literally told you he'd eat the salmon and then acted like that never happened. and they could have prepared the salmon a different way.   He should have been the one to leave, not both of you. hes a grown man, he can figure it out. this is manipulative and gross and hes a walking red flag.", "NTA.  All he had to do was ask them to prepare the salmon the way he wanted it done.  I'm sorry you married a child.", "NTA. Grow up, Chris.", "NTA He could\u2019ve easily asked that the salmon be prepared to his liking, at some point I would just continue ordering and eating and he can sit and watch.

Also at restaurants like that you can usually ask for the seasoning to be taken off", "NTA. You can also negotiate on the seasoning. \n\nAlso, adults can eat things that aren't their *favourite* food. Maybe I'm being unfair, but unless you have a clinical diagnosis (e.g. autism spectrum), picky eating is a problem.

That kind of behavior in a 29 year old is intolerable.  I don't see how it is ever going to change at this point, and it is something he can control and it is his fault.

You gave him every chance in the world to make absolutely sure there\u2019d be something he could eat.

He sounds exhausting.", "NTA, I am a pretty picky eater, and if someone sends me a menu, I make sure to read it before agreeing to go anywhere.

Are we sure this wasn't some sort of powerplay, OP?", "NTA- I don\u2019t get why you left the restaurant- your parents wanted to have dinner with you! Let him sulk or starve.", "NAH, did you know that he is like that and he is not going to change, some of us are disgusted by a certain type of food or how they look and it does not seem right to me to want someone to eat something they do not want just for education, live with them or look for another partner", "NTA. Since becoming an adult, he has decided to remain picky (which is just a bad habit), rather than deciding to become a well rounded human being that is kind, respectful, gracious, and willing to participate in social events such as family meals at a nice restaurant.", "NTA. I would have been so irritated by him. He\u2019s not a baby ffs. Sometimes you just need to try things and if you then don\u2019t like it? Fair enough! But he\u2019s not even trying by the sounds of it", "NTA he may as well have worn a big sign around his neck that said, \"Hey!! Make this about me!!!\"", "NTA, but you made poor choices. As you knew that Chris entertains himself by ruining others\u2019 meals, why did you invite him to dinner with you and your parents? Assuming that he\u2019s not such a jerk about other activities, why not choose a different activity? If he\u2019s a jerk about everything, why are you with him?\n \nI take issue with you blaming his bad behavior on his mother. It\u2019s sexist. He had two parents both of who could have cooked and he\u2019s an adult who\u2019s had time to modify his behavior. My mother was a horrible cook and my father didn\u2019t cook. I am a good cook and I eat almost everything. \n \nI also take issue with the many posters who believe that restaurants should change their menus to accommodate pickiness. This means that one of the line cooks would have to deal exclusively with Chris\u2019 meal. They would have to go over every seasoning and cooking technique with him to ensure that he wouldn\u2019t throw a tantrum. Even if there weren\u2019t currently a labor shortage, it would be unfair to the restaurant as it would be costly and to other customers who would have to wait longer for their food. \n \nAlso, people don\u2019t understand how restaurants buy food. They run on thin profit margins, so waste is to be avoided. Let\u2019s use salmon as an example. If the menu lists salmon with mushroom sauce, the restaurant has purchased the correct amount of salmon and of mushrooms to make the number of the dish they expect to serve. If someone wants salmon sans mushrooms they may have to throw out mushrooms. \n\nPeople should check the menu before making reservations. If they don\u2019t like the dishes as presented, they should go elsewhere. There are chain restaurants and fast food restaurants for people who require customization.", "NTA. Your bf changed his mind and caused a scene. Not cool. You should ask yourself if this behavior is what you want in a life partner. I think he needs to do some more maturing before being in a relationship. You are his partner, not his mom, and he should not be forcing you to deal with him like he\u2019s a kid having a tantrum.", "NTA for your question.\n\nBut ESH, it was rude and just...weird of you to ditch your parents at the restaurant because your bf has the palette of a child.", "YTA, I\u2019m almost certain it\u2019s illegal to date a toddler", "Could have asked to have the salmon unseasoned.  If I go to a restuarant and somebody does not want to eat their food, no skin off my nose.  No need to force him to eat.  If he has an eating disorder, suggest he get help or get out.", "NTA.", "NTA, but if it's running your life and hurting your other relationships, maybe you should take a look at that. This sounds like it might not be a healthy dynamic for you two. Had he been to therapy for this? You really should talk to a professional about this if it's as bad as you made it out to be in your post. I'm not saying break-up, I'm saying you should work on it with him if you want the relationship to work and to stop letting his eating habits affect your relationship with others.", "Nope. NTA. Picky eaters are insufferable. As soon as I find out you\u2019re a picky eater, I\u2019m done going out with you.", "I am a very picky eater and I have never had to leave a restaurant. Even a sushi place can get me a bowl of white rice to nibble on in an \"emergency.\" I recognize that I am the weirdo, so I am the one who needs to adapt. \n\nHe knew the restaurant in advance - he could have eaten something earlier. He could have ordered a salad. He could have requested the salmon be prepared differently. There are many options for picky eaters to get us through an hour or two at a restaurant.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I am married to this man - who thinks that steaks should be burned to be edible. I always point out that the items on the children\u2019s menu might be for his liking.  It\u2019s been 45 years, his palette is slowing changing and he is learning not to act like a child in restaurants.", "This isn't going to change.  Not only is he picky, he is high maintenance and fragile.  You tried to accommodate his quirk, he screwed up and rather than be gracious, he acted childish.  \n\n\nNTA, and consider if this is what you want your future to look like.  Every meal, every outing.", "He didn't even ask if you could change restaurants. He made a face, and said there was nothing he could eat, which is a fact. When should he have said there was nothing for him to eat-- when the waiter came over to take your orders? Like, he didn't ask to switch restaurants, he didn't get mad at you. It sounded like he was complaining he couldn't eat anything, and yeah, he should have read the menu more carefully, but it's easy to miss details. Why is your parents' hurt more important than the fact that he was \\*upset\\* about the prospect of sitting through a meal without anything to eat? \n\nAs a picky eater (and a vegetarian), I can see his side of things -- it is draining to go out to eat with friends, and having to accommodate their dining preferences 95% of the time, and only getting accommodated when you explicitly ask for it. Special occasions, celebrating friends' promotions, all of that, and I can't participate fully because of my picky eating, and I don't make it my friends' problems as much as possible, but you are his partner, and so his ability to fully participate should be something you prioritize.\n\n He's clearly trying to broaden his palette from what you describe. I feel like as his partner, when he said that there was only one dish on the menu that he felt comfortable with, that should have been something that made you choose another restaurant, because being \\*his\\* partner means that you pay more attention to his eating preferences than the average person would. What happened if the situation was something like, there was only one dish, he would have enjoyed it, but for whatever reason, the restaurant was out of salmon or something else used in the preparation of the dish? Why would YOU pick a restaurant where there was only one thing he could eat?\n\n I would be angry if my partner invited me out to a sushi restaurant with their parents with only one veggie roll option that I would maybe eat. There's no medical reason for me to be a vegetarian, like there's no medical reason for Chris being so picky, but I would be hurt if my partner didn't try to find a different restaurant that had more options for me to pick from.  \n\n\nChris chose the wrong time, wrong place, and didn't communicate his frustration properly, but I can understand where it's coming from. I'd say ESH. I understand it's frustrating for you to have to limit your dining options for him, but whatever frustration you feel about being limited by his preferences is something that he deals with every time he thinks about going out to eat.", "NTA. Picky eaters aren\u2019t for everyone, but even so, once they start making it everyone else\u2019s problem, that\u2019s the AH behavior.", "NTA. Maybe he can't control his food preferences, but he can control how it impacts others. As your partner invested in bringing your families together, he should have made an effort to find a place that he would like and would be special for your parents. He should know by now that this behavior is a major buzzkill.", "NTA \nYou weren't shaming him because he's a picky eater you called him out on his childish behavior. I'm also a really picly eater but I always check the menu before I go somewhere (nobody has to tell me to do that) and even if I don't like anything I tell my friends/ family we can still go there and I will just eat some side dishes", "Tbf, he could have sensory issues. I'm neurodivergent and textures in particular are a huge problem for me. This isn't something you can necessarily know before getting there. Has he looked into testing? Super \"picky eating\" is one of the most common signs, you know.", "Nta for being upset with him for acting like a jerk. You didn't get upset because he's picky, it was his behavior. Your behavior wasn't much better tho. Who just leaves their parents sitting in a restaurant like that? He didn't want to eat? Too bad, he'll just sit there hungry till everyone else eats. Or he could have eaten rolls, a side dish, dessert. Or waited in the car. You should be more worried about the fact he showed out in front of your parents like that then got mad at you for getting upset with him. That's a huge reference flag.", "NTA given you asked he look over the menu beforehand, he claimed he did and found something suitable, and then waited until you all arrived to find an issue. I would be embarrassed, too. It\u2019s a bit late at that point. He should\u2019ve sat there and waited to eat something else later without making a production out of it.", "NTA. He is an adult acting like a child. I hope you never leave a restaurant again  because he has decided not to eat. Good luck in the future with your picky eater.", "NTA And as a spouse of an elderly picky eater, he should see a dietitian to make sure he understands the long-term consequences of being a picky eater. He could end up with major health problems as he ages.", "NTA. I\u2019m a picky eater in that there are a lot of ingredients that I don\u2019t eat.

Most restaurants will make small changes like that.", "It's a restaurant...and it was salmon.  If he didn't like the herbs (because he apparently can't read), he just asks them to prepare it saut\u00e9ed in whatever without the seasonings.  It's not like this dish is already prepared.  He sounds truly exhausting and acting like a toddler.  I honestly don't think I could put up with this kind of behavior on a daily basis.  OP is NTA but I'd be rethinking this relationship unless he gets some real help with this issue.", "Agreed here. She shouldn\u2019t have left her parents. He could have sat there like a spoiled child and pout. Also, if he wanted the salmon without the seasoning, all he had to do was say, can I just have the salmon grilled plain. I wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with that nonsense. And I\u2019m still shocked that she left with him. That alone makes me want to say that she is a TA.", "Exactly. I also date a picky eater who would pull this stuff at 1st. Every time we went to a restaurant it was the dramatics and sulking that got to me. He would either be mad they didn\u2019t have much to choose from that he liked or he would get sulky when the food showed up and he ended up not liking it. Complaining about how he wasted money again and was going hungry the entire time I was trying to enjoy my meal. It would ruin the entire meal/experience. \n\nI eventually got mad and told him that it\u2019s fine he\u2019s picky, I\u2019m not trying to change him or force him to eat stuff he doesn\u2019t like. But he needs to regulate his emotions and how he handles it because I\u2019m sick of being uncomfortable because he\u2019s sulking and complaining. He can\u2019t be turning his nose up or making rude comments and faces at what others are enjoying just because he thinks it\u2019s \u201cgross\u201d. It took a while to fully break the habit, but now restaurant dining is much more pleasant. \n\nIt does suck, sharing a meal is a very social thing and we don\u2019t usually get invited to people\u2019s homes for it much because they will try to accommodate him but he won\u2019t even try it. I know it\u2019s not fully his fault (trying it and spitting it out or making a face is ruder than refusing I guess) but it\u2019s frustrating having to always host with the same handful of food items if we want to share a meal with friends or family. Some of my favourite restaurants have nothing he likes. So he\u2019ll go with me and not eat, which is also awkward (but better than complaining I guess).", "So he always gets to pick the restaurant instead of finding menu items he can enjoy at whatever restaurant?

The inability to actually fix anything for more than a one off crushed me emotionally.\n\nI have almost no happy memories except the day he left.\n\nToss this one back, he's underdeveloped and undercooked and you can't fix that only he can. & He'd still perfectly happy to be ill mannered and throw hissy fits.\n\nSeriously, you have a better future waiting for you somewhere else.", "Absolutely NTA. This was also very intentional act. He wanted you to chose him over your parents. If he cared he would have picked anything else even a dessert. He could have excused himself to the bathroom and texted you. \u201cBabe I\u2019m freaking out, I didn\u2019t read the menu well enough and I\u2019m afraid noting really looks appealing. Would you be hurt if I opted for a side of fries, a dessert?

It's my problem, no one else's. Definitely NTA.", "I wonder if he copes poorly in other aspects of life. Most adults would not wish to cause a scene and would take a minute to think through their options- asking if the seasoning can be ommitted, asking if they can get a large salad and/or baked potato, bread, veg, etc., in order to accomodate their party in eating at a restaurant they had also agreed to eat at...\n\nHis reaction was embarrassing, yes, but the fact that he isn't embarrassed by his rudeness (frankly might even feel entitled to behave this way) seems like a deeper problem.", "Honey, how often do you get to spend time with your parents? How often does he throw a fit and make you leave?\n\nLove doesn't have to be like this.", "You can request modifications on orders such as, no seasoning on the salmon please. Seems easy enough for him to just ask and move forward. If it\u2019s not then this is way bigger being a picky eater. Entitlement behavior is unacceptable.", "It was. He had already made a face like a child, and had been outright rude. Chances are his behavior would have escalated if you had ignored him and tried to stay.", "I'm not dissing love.\n\nPeople are more than their worst habit/issue.\n\nBut look how much you compromise in your social life.\n\nI fought so hard for my marriage.

Hardly anyone was there so you would think they would want my business. It was a fucking ordeal!! I had to get the manager and argue with them. Like wtf is it to you?!

It's not normal. \nMy dear friend has extreme dietary restrictions, and of it's just her and I, we'll lean towards restaurants that cater to her needs. However if in a group setting she sucks it up and goes in with a game plan of how to enjoy the company of others and allow everyone to enjoy the experience. She doesnt expect anyone else to cater to her. \n\nWhat the BF did was ridiculously childish. Hes the picky one, it's his responsibility to not ruin a night out.", "She is, and always will be, my hero. Sweetest, kindest, and most thoughtful person you'll ever meet. Unless you hurt someone she loves, then she'll cut you with a smile.", ":-D", "Yer getting all salty.", "Exactly. My ex used to tell me that the scary and horrible stuff HE did to me was what I did to HIM. And he would insist, over and over, trying to make me believe that all the pain and poison in our relationship was my fault to the extent that he needed to bang his employee to show our infant son what a deep and loving relationship looks like.", "INFO: So did Chris tell you he wanted to leave, or was that your choice? And did he bring up the fact he did not like anything on the menu, or did he only say something after you asked? \n\nFrom your comments it seems like leaving was your idea, cause you were embarrassed that  someone else did not like the food.\n\nSo is it Chris's problem, or your problem?", "Unpopular opinion here but YTA. \n\nFirst off y\u2019all are trying to tell OP that this guy is an abusive AH and implying that he\u2019s using eating habits to control her. She said nothing to indicate this is the case. Stop being armchair psychiatrists. You don\u2019t know him or her or the relationship they have. Yes he wanted more support and was unhappy but can you blame him? Oh wait you already have. \n\nMy partner is what people consider a \u201cpicky eater\u201d. It\u2019s because he\u2019s on the spectrum and smells and looks of food can really make him anxious. He wasn\u2019t diagnosed as a kid so everyone just thought he was being unreasonable when he was basically having a panic attack. In fact he got bullied in school when he would have a meltdown over food. Bullied over food. As a SPED TA, I\u2019d spent enough time with kids on the spectrum to understand why he was that way. It took over a year of us being together for me to actually get him to try things like spaghetti marinara. But I was patient and met him where he was at and that\u2019s a huge reason why he trusted me to make food that might not look good to him but knows it is good. And is now cooking that food for himself. \n\nHonestly, I was a picky eater as a kid but was abused into eating veg and other stuff like that and now I have to force myself to regularly eat vegetables. No joke. Them making me eat my food gave me an aversion to it. \n\nIdk how long you have been together but even if it\u2019s been 10 years, making a big deal about \u201cpicky\u201d eating is just\u2026dumb. I get it\u2019s frustrating and embarrassing that it happened in front of you parents. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s tough for you. But scolding him like a child in the restaurant and making him apologize to you parents? I have no words for that. If you want him to expand his palate then be patient and supportive and nonjudgmental no matter the circumstance. He\u2019s right. It isn\u2019t something he can help.\n\nAnd I know he had time to look at the menu but maybe the menu didn\u2019t specify how it was prepared online when he looked. Or he might have been trying really hard for you and your parents but when it came to it, he just couldn\u2019t help it. \n\nFood is a dumb hill to die on and yet it seems ingrained in our society to shame people about things like eating habits and lifestyle choices. It\u2019s just food OP. Is that really worth making your boyfriend feel like crap about himself? Everyone is different and being \u201cpicky\u201d isn\u2019t morally wrong. It\u2019s not a character flaw and it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s being a controlling partner who\u2019s trying to isolate you from you friends and family with\u2026food\u2026?", "Exactly. This wasn't a post about a picky eater. This is a man who is inconsiderate, selfish and is willing to ruin an outing for everyone, simply because they didn't take the time to do some basic research and wanted everyone to cater to them.", "Reschedule your whole life without Chris.", "Or eat some sides/carbs and engage in conversation. Then stop by McDonald's on the way home. He gave the restaurant his seal of approval, therefore his problem was entirely his fault and he went with the most childish route to manage the situation and embarrassed his girlfriend. \n\nI 100% agree with your comment. Making a damn face at the menu? Jesus, that's a child's response that a parent trains out of them. One bad meal isn't the end of the world, especially when you're definitely going to be judged by your partner's parents for an infantile response.  \n\nI once had a college band dinner after an event at Olive Garden. At the time, I didn't like Italian food at all. However I wanted to give it a chance, and really didn't have much choice. \n\nWhen the menus arrived, there was only one option I thought was appetizing to me: Chicken Alfredo. Fast forward to the dish, and I tried but, but couldn't continue to eat it for the texture and the smell. You know what I did?\n\nNothing. I stopped eating it, ate more bread, and talked to people. Later when I got hungry I ate my own meal.\n\nNot related to my point several years later, when I told some other college colleagues who happen to be excellent cooks the story, they told me I don't dislike Italian food: I dislike *bad* Italian food. That evening they made an italian dish for the group (we were at their house) and they were correct: it was delicious. :) It's still not my cuisine of choice, but my palate has slowly matured since then. \n\nOP's palate will very likely grow, since his gf encourages him to try new foods. But in the meantime, he shouldn't be so damn immature about it. Again, he approved that restaurant. OP was embarrassed because her bf is immature, which is embarrassing.", "Or even just get a drink or two. This guy sounds insufferable", "Sadly the group of people who can and will be more flexible eaters is shrinking. Nearly everyone these days has food sensitivity or allergies, probably because our environment is full of toxins.  That can't be helped and must be accommodated. Then people further restrict their diet by choice for religious, ethical or philosophical reasons. That must be supported for obvious reasons, as people have a right to their beliefs. \n\nBut on top of that is a newer phenomenon I have not grown up with, people who are \"picky\" in the way the boyfriend is.  I used to think okay, if you're picky then you must have a highly developed palate and want high quality food, sort of like Chef Ramsay. \n\nBut no, apparently the new concept of \"picky\" is quite the opposite and means an extremely limited palate possibly due to being raised on-the-go, eating highly processed foods that are quick to microwave. And very few families these days seem to have the luxury of sitting down together for dinner. This is where manners and learning compromise over food used to take place. Unfortunately the result is someone as inflexible in their food choices as anyone who has one of the other causes for restrictions I mentioned earlier. My daughter has very treasured friends who fall into this category. \n\nAs a mom who has attempted for the last 15 years to host and accommodate my daughter's friends for sleepovers and celebratory dinners, I can only say I feel immense relief my daughter is 18 and this is her responsibility now. \n\nAnd she's finally appreciating why I would ask for advance notice before friends are brought over. Because shopping for meal ingredients to accommodate even as few as 3 kids, all with very divergent and rigid lists of acceptable foods, was incredibly expensive and stressful. I didn't want anyone to feel unwelcome, burdensome or excluded. But as guest lists grew, cooking became simply impossible and I often had to undertake the expense of ordering in from multiple restaurants. \n\nI can't help remembering how my own parents and all the parents used to just serve up one meal and we all gratefully dug in. My mom used to feed the entire street of kids on spaghetti night! \n\nI don't fault people for having dietary restrictions because I and my daughter have them ourselves for health reasons. This isn't about assigning blame. I'm just acknowledging where we are and how challenging it all can be.  It's not as simple as avoiding any one person who has restricted their diet for whatever reason.", "Yep. I had a friend who was a picky eater. She figured out how to order chicken nuggets at basically any restaurant. For instance if we ate Chinese? She\u2019d get orange or sweet and sour chicken - sauce on the side. It\u2019s basically chicken nuggets and dipping sauce and rice. Picky eaters can make it work.", "My mom always asks for plain or lightly seasoned fish if the menu says it's prepared a different way. She's never been told \"no.\"", "I'm still super picky but if someone took the time to have me look over the menu in advance to make sure I could eat, you bet your ass I would be eating.", "Exactly! Besides just acting mature, couldn't he put his big boy chonies on and say, \"Can you grill it instead of deep fry it?\" or whatever. I'm not too picky but I do try and eat healthy as possible and have some issues with dairy. If I saw only one thing on a menu that was acceptable to me and it had one thing about it I didn't like, I would ask for some sort of adjustment, like ordering it without cheese or with a salad on the side instead of fries or whatever the issue is.", "I think you have a very skewed view on this. First, only about 10% of people have actual food allergies. There are definitely people who choose to restrict thier diets for a variety of reasons, but that has always been true. People often choose to to go on whatever the newest fad diet is. As for feeding your kid's friends, I think a lot of \"picky\" kids will try things outside their comfort zones if given the opportunity. I  just spent a weekend feeding 60+ kids for a school retreat. We had exactly 3 kids with actual allergies we accommodated. We made sure that there were fruits and veggies available and we made basic meals (pancakes, tacos, spaghetti) and allowed the kids to choose what went on each with meatless options available and had zero complaints. My point wasn't that OP won't encounter people with dietary restrictions for whatever reason, but she doesn't have to permanently tie herself to a grown man who throws a fit when the world doesn't cater to him. Anybody with any manners would be capable of finding something to eat on the menu and be pleasant to her parents without making faces and acting like an entitled brat.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
