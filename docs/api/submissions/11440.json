If nothing else, even fancy restaurants have kiddie menues. Picky eaters can usually find something from there.   \n\n\nThere's definately more to this story. Does your bf have brain damage or a memory disability? If he actually did say he'd have salmon and then got all mad because there's nothing to eat, that's some kind of weirdo abuse tactic there.

But my husband broke out of it and eats what I cook, tries new food gleefully and our kid eats Japanese, Mexican, Italian, Korean, and Indian food, loves all vegetables, etc. My husband's brother though - holy shit, its bad. He has three kids and none of them will eat the same meal. His wife and my MIL just martyr themselves to the little princes' whims.

Now there is a big event (meet the parents) that is in a karoke bar.  The person agrees to go and sing.  Now we get there and now the person doesn't want to stand up in public and sing in front of a bunch of strangers.  \n\nWhat are you going to do?  Force them to stand up and sing in public?  If you knew they were the most socially conscious person \"I have ever met\" why are you shocked you expect them to act otherwise?  Why did you have so much riding on this person singing in public?  Is the person responsible for their actions and agreeing to it?  Yes, but you are still left with the person not singing and whatever that results.  You've risked so much on something you know was out of your control/based on the subjective \"pickiness\" of someone else.  The OP knew (\"the absolute pickiest eater I have ever met\") and should had acted on what she had known.\n\n>  And she did try to accommodate his needs by asking him to look at the menu beforehand?\n\nShe is taking action trying to solve his problem.  Either its her problem or its not.", "So I editted a bit on you as you were replying.\n\nNTA technically I guess, but geez, if you know the guy is averse to 99% of seafood\u2026.. suggest a steakhouse?

It\u2019s too bad that he\u2019s so picky, but the real problem is his attitude about it (changing his mind about what he wants, expecting the group to cater to him, making disgusted faces\u2026\u2026in other words, arcing like a four year old).", "It creates a sour mood for everyone. I have a friend who used to just not order anything and put his head down if we went somewhere he was too picky to eat at.

Adults provide solutions, children present with problems.", "A shellfish partner, if you will", "For my 40th birthday (and her 35th) a friend and I went to Venice.  For my birthday dinner, I took us to a very expensive restaurant, which is when I discovered that she didn't like seafood and also that that was all they sold.\n\nSo there are restaurants that only do seafood!\n\nBut they made her a simple pasta oglio e aglio, she graciously ate it, and we both enjoyed their lovely wines and homemade, on-the-house limoncello.

He sounds exhausting", "The boyfriend could have just ordered a side dish or something small instead of making a face and claiming OP should have known he wouldn't like it. He was given the opportunity to review the same menu beforehand and chose something from it in advance. Then, while seated at the table, decided that menu wasn't okay anymore. That's on him for not looking carefully enough.\n\nI'm also a picky eater but I take the burden of that on myself.

But if they didn\u2019t sing because this karaoke bar didn\u2019t have their favourite version of song, started sulking and protesting in front of my parents and blamed me for this, even tho beforehand they had said like \"Yes this is the song I can sing no problem\" then yes, I would be shocked. \n\n>The OP knew (\"the absolute pickiest eater I have ever met\") and should had acted on what she had known.\n\nI mean, the bf isn't a toddler, should OP avoid all and every situation where there is food because the bf might start sulking and ruin the event for everyone?", "Fuck that, this guy is a child and so is any other \u201cadult\u201d who can\u2019t figure out how to eat one thing off a menu no matter where they are without disrespecting the people taking you to dinner.\n\nNTA op, and I would honestly have lost patience with this baby a long time ago and sent him back to his moms house to have chicken tenders the rest of his life", "Well the nearly 30 year old could have read the menu properly and then let her know that there wasn't anything he would eat and ask they go elsewhere- which was the purpose of telling him in advance.
