My parents live in another part of the state, and I don't see them often, so I ran it by Chris and we made plans.\n\nThe restaurant was a new seafood place that opened close to where we live. Since I knew how picky Chris can be, I asked him to look over the menu before we went so that we could make sure there would be something there that he'd eat. He told me he looked it over and would have the salmon.\n\nFast forward to this evening, when we all sat down to eat and he made a disgusted face looking at the menu. I asked what was wrong and he told me there's nothing he'd eat. My parents looked a bit hurt, so I pulled Chris aside and said that I couldn't believe he'd do this, that if he wouldn't like the food he had all of yesterday and most of today to pick a different restaurant. I then commented that I was just annoyed by his picky eating because now it's hurting my parents, and left the restaurant with him(after apologizing to my parents).\n\nHe told me that he was in shock that I didn't defend him and that I \"should have known\" he would be unhappy, and was being a total AH for publicly humiliating \"what he can't control\".\n\nAITA?\n\nQuick edit about the salmon: I had asked him about that, and I guess the problem is he read the menu again and saw how it was prepared, like he didn't care for the seasoning that was going to be on the salmon.", "created_utc": 1677931757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hxqwt/aita_for_publicly_scolding_my_bfs_picky_eating/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pretty AHish to leave your parents behind and leave with him, though. Why would you punish your parents for his behaviour?\n\nETA I\u2018m a picky eater. As an adult, that\u2019s not something you make someone else\u2019s problem. As an adult, you surely don\u2019t let your gf miss out on an evening with her parents whom she rarely sees.", "Nta, he said it was ok then all of a sudden it wasn\u2019t", "NTA.   \n\n\nBut what else is going on here? This isn't normal. I have weird food things too and I would never be like this. I like it when people show me a menu first, but I know how to order for myself even if I don't. If nothing else, even fancy restaurants have kiddie menues. Picky eaters can usually find something from there.   \n\n\nThere's definately more to this story. Does your bf have brain damage or a memory disability? If he actually did say he'd have salmon and then got all mad because there's nothing to eat, that's some kind of weirdo abuse tactic there. Embarrassing you in front of your parents, and then claiming you are the one embarrassing him.   \n\n\nPerhaps its MEANT to be confusing? Is this a pattern? Does he do other abusive things?   \n\n\nYou might want to read a book called \"Why Does He Do That?\" by Laundry Bancroff. It's even floating around the internets on PDF if you can't afford it. It talks about tactics like this made by abusive men. I honestly can't tell from your post if you're dealing with one here.", "NTA. He lied to you about being okay with one of the menu items and then made a small scene about the same menu!! What! \n\nPicky eater or no, that is an AH move. He needs to be honest and show you the same respect that he wants from you.", "NTA, get yourself a different man because bf doesn't sound like one. \n\nHe can't suck it up for one dinner? Dump that big baby.", "ESH\n\nYour BF sounds super picky and hard to go out to eat with. He needs to work on that because it's going to make him a real pill to be around at any social function. Doesn't sound like he sees his issues as a problem. Also, he could very easily have asked for something off the kids' menu and said he will pay the same price as the salmon and just gotten chicken fingers and fries or something. I find it hard to believe there is absolutely nothing he could have eaten.\n\nBut a slight YTA for you, too. You knew your BF is a picky eater and you picked a *seafood restaurant?* I mean, c'mon, OP. Perhaps this is a regional thing, but fish isn't a very popular food around here. About half my relatives will only barely tolerate it, so for example, I would never serve it at a dinner party, because I want to have things on the menu I know people will enjoy. You should have gone for a more mainstream dining choice like a Chilis or an Olive Garden where your BF was more likely to find success--I'm assuming he'll eat a burger or pasta.", "NTA. He sounds exhausting", "NTA, you tried to accommodate him by checking with him and getting him to look at menu with plenty of time to spare. It's not your fault he can't read a menu.", "NTA\n\nHe looked at the menu and said it was fine, he can't blame anyone else but himself", "NTA - former reformed picky eater here, but I\u2019ll still spot an onion or green pepper from a mile away! Does he do much cooking at home? It took me having control in the kitchen to be more adventurous in what I\u2019d try. \n\nHaving him look at the menu beforehand is the right thing to do, and he made his decision, so I don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t just go with wanted he wanted. Unless it is a control issue.", "NTA and you tried to address this with him beforehand.  He was good with the salmon.  There\u2019s a larger issue.  It sounds like he does this, in part, so he can be \u201cbetter than\u201d others.  He made a face so everyone could see how disgusted he was with the food.  Normal humans can eat any kind of food, but he, being superior, can only eat the best food.\n\nHe\u2019s a complete AH.  YOU ARE NTA and I bet he does the same thing with soap, clothes, a car . . .", "NTA\nWe all have different kind of disabilities and can not expect that other's build there life around us.

Chris is a big boy, he can use his big boy words.\n\nYou told him to check the menu, he said he found something to eat, you have to assume that the *adult* is responsible for their own choices and will speak up if something is wrong. You should not have to mind read that \"the salmon will be fine\" means \"I'm going to make a scene at a seafood restaurant and blame you for not saving me from the evil fishes.\"\n\nHe's the one with a dietary \"restriction\", he has to speak up for himself because no one is going to do it for him. Why is he making you responsible for food availability when he won't do the absolute minimum for himself?", "you know your bf is a picky eater . W'hy did you pick a seafood restaurant ?

But why did you leave the restaurant? I'd have finished the meal and made him wait. Surely there were some side dishes or appetisers he could have snacked on?", "He is an entire adult capable of making compromises, ESPECIALLY in front of the parents-in-law. He needs to learn to start adulting, although if that's something he hasn't done by now then I wonder when he ever will.\n\nNTA, but you guys need to have a tough conversation because this has gone beyond an at-home compromise between you two privately and is starting to become an issue that affects other people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
