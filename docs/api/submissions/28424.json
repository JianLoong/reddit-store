Works fine if you live close. \n\nMany friends with kids have divorced and see it as a week off. They get their time with their kids, but then get a break to have less responsibility. Works great and means going out, doing things, but getting quality time with the kids still.", "OP stated, \"Neither of us pay or receive child support\". This has to remain fair to both parties, based on their earnings and the expenses over time of the child. I have strong doubts that a situation of complete financial equality can persist, and stay the same, and keep the original agreement fair, for both of these ex- spouses.

That's the point this poster is making.", "We only have his report, and not hers. Does she earn more than he does? If so, why would he have agreed to this unfair financial deal? I don't think his report of himself or his report of her are accurate.", "And thank you for being nice enough to share and satisfy my curiosity! Totally understand the concern and heck that shows how much you care.", "Why don\u2019t you believe him? Cause he\u2019s male so must be a deadbeat?"]}
