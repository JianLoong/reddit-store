Even if you share other 'frivolous' expenses between you she is still footing the majority of the everyday costs. We're in a cost of living crisis. \n\nWhy should she give up her little luxuries, when she works full time. These everyday costs need to be quantified and shared between the two of you. Not just the 'here and there' expenses. I'm not a fan of child support arrangements that don't provide an exact figure. Even with the best intentions it causes issues. \n\nWhilst I appreciate many of the points you have raised it is very hard to work overtime with an eight year old, as you need to pay for childcare.
