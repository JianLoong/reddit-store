Save up and move out if you dislike your sister and mum that much, laptops get broken. Yes it sucks that your sister(to you) broke it and it wasn\u2019t replaced but things happen. If no one died and no one injured it can be fixed and you learn to move on, which you need to move on by moving out and living your own life where you are around people you currently dislike. \nIts that or you have a mature conversation with your mum, apologise for shouting at her (even if you disagree), and get to the bottom of what happened to your laptop.

I\u2019m guessing your mother didn\u2019t want to take sides.", "YTA. You overreacted and can't emotionally regulate which needs work. Your sister is childish and you both need to move out of your mom's house. Also, I'm not sure that the title matches the story. If you're dramatically screaming at your mom you'll never forgive her because years ago your sister lied about spilling something on a laptop and your mom isn't on your side/is over it, you need to speak to a mental health professional.", "ESH. You two are grown women. Why does your mother need to be involved at all?", "Have you tried destroying your sisters things? Throwing trash or pouring mouldy food on her jewellery. Tell her anything done to your items, you will double it back to her. She breaks it? You take her belongings and sell them.\n\nNTS", "YTA. That's a really shitty thing to say to your mom over a material object. I could understand if your sisters lies harmed you in anyway or they beat you or..literally anything other than this.", "NTA. Your frustration about your sister damaging your computer is valid. While emotions ran high, effective communication is crucial. Express your feelings calmly, focusing on finding a solution. Set boundaries for your belongings in a constructive way to avoid escalation. It's vital to discuss the incident with your sister, explaining its impact and hearing her side. Holding onto grudges can harm your well-being, so consider forgiveness for your own peace of mind. Instead of saying you'll never forgive your mother, express your feelings openly about needing her support. Family dynamics are complex; seeking a healthier approach to conflicts can lead to better resolutions and relationships.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
