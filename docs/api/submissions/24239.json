This is a prime example as it\u2019s obvious that OP nor their sister understand how to communicate without acting like children.", "Difference is they are still acting like children and expecting their mommy to handle their issues. Ridiculous.", "I\u2019ve heard of cultures allowing children in schooling to stay, in what culture are they staying with parents \u201cwell into adulthood\u201d as the norm?", "She's contributing DRAMA. So is the sister. Mum should have kicked them both to the curb years ago.", "Because living alone is incredibly beneficial in most cases, even if you have a perfect family. The two just don't compare and it's a shame that a lot of people wait for a marriage or a job to be independent.\n\nUnless they have financial issues or some kind of disability, these ''kids'' would do better outside of this environment.", "Because she needs to learn how to be an adult instead of an overgrown, coddled AH who acts like a preteen.", "This is Reddit. Everything is abuse. Good thing OP is an adult and can remove herself from this horrible abusive situation if it\u2019s so bad.", "[deleted]", "This is a perfect example that many people don\u2019t really mature until they\u2019re independent. I understand that in some cultures, people don\u2019t automatically move out in their college years. But I also understand that if they don\u2019t leave their childhood home, they never really escape their childhood dynamic. That\u2019s how you end up with a 28 year old and a 33 year old acting like childish brats.", "Except they're also not wrong.  Culturally, it is the US (and by infection, Canada) who are the odd ones out in the world for people being *expected* to move out in their teens/twenties.\n\nAnd that's the core difference here.  Europe, it isn't a cultural expectation.  North America, it *is*.", "I'm a fully functional adult.\n\nBut not if I end up on a trip or holiday or gathering with my brother. \n\nInevitably someone ends up storming off and slamming doors. \n\nI'm reasonably sure he's also at least a mostly functional adult. \n\nJust can't live together. And clearly OP can't live with her sister.", "OP could have closed her laptop and walked away, problem solved. Instead she chose to scream and cry and act helpless and expect mommy to come in and punish her sister for her, so yes, OP is ABSOLUTELY a part of the problem, too.", "Op needs to handle this with her sister or move out, not wail and expect mommy to solve her sibling problems.", "[deleted]", "Maybe in this particular instance, but plenty of people live with family for a variety of reasons in normal, sane ways.\n\nAnd really, in this economy?  Barring issues like OP is having, it's foolish to NOT to pool resources and work together.", "The parents are at fault for not equipping their children to become functional, independent adults. \n\nMy ex was like this- he had a weirdly enmeshed relationship with his mother and siblings. None of them had ever left home- he was the first one (and only one in the decade we were together) and although the youngest, was almost 30 when he left home for the first time. The rest of them still lived in their childhood bedrooms, slept in their childhood beds, had the same wallpaper with racing cars on the walls... it was creepy, really Norman Bates kind of stuff. The mother often said how lovely she thought it was that her children wanted to live with her forever. The whole house reeked of repressed sexuality and chip fat.", "Sister might be TA in this particular moment, but the way OP describes her own reaction, it's very clear that she's 50% of the problem in the relationship. Both of them need to pack their crap and get some life experience.", "I agree, OP is part of the issue - but not the cause of it. They are not at fault.", "Freaking out because a person who has already destroyed your expensive possession is treating your replacement with similar contempt just for the shits and giggles. Someone who doesn't have the spare income to rent/buy one their own. But yeah such overreaction /s", "Alright, what is the financial status that someone young has in those areas?  Is their minimum wage a fraction of the cost of living?  Would they need to be working 100+ hours a week to afford a one bedroom apartment, let alone food and other necessities?  Because that is the norm through a large swath of the US and Canada.\n\nThis is why I said those variables need to be taken into consideration in areas with a high number of young adults living independently.", "I figure it is incredibly hard for any parent to see their baby as an adult. No matter the situation. My grandma is 90, my dad is 60. She still babies him because he's her baby. \n\nMost parents are just never going to see you as an adult as in their mind you are always their child. Not a fellow adult.", "There is no real evidence that the mother actually believed the sister, OP has only convinced herself of this because the mother didn't intervene in the conflict between OP and her sister. And it's most likely that the mother didn't intervene because OP and her sister are adults who should be handing their conflicts with each other on their own, not running and tattling to mommy and expecting her to punish the other one. They are 28 and 33 for god's sake!", "No, its unreasonable to continue to put yourself in situations where you know you will have meltdowns.  What is the saying \"a definition of insanity is doing the same stuff over and over again and expecting different results\"  its not that she is upset about being lied to or that her mother believed her sister's lies, its she continues to expose herself to these people and continues to get frustrated that they both act the same way and then she reacts the same way.  Of course nothing will change when that is the cycle.", "Being upset is one thing. Screaming and flipping out like a toddler is the opposite of an adult reaction.", ">a lifetime of not being believed by a caregiver \n\nA caregiver? He is 28. I mean clearly it does not bother him enough to move out.", "Again, we don't actually know that there was \"a lifetime of not being believed by a caregiver\", we only know there were two incidents of a mother choosing not to intervene in conflicts between her two adult children who are old enough to be resolving them themselves without running to mommy.", "It takes two to tango in a dynamic like this, and each person is responsible for their own behavior, so even if you aren't the instigator, you're still at fault. Besides, only have the OP's version of the story, and only regarding this issue over the laptop. We don't know that this episode over the computer isn't the latest in a vicious cycle of tit-for-tat pettiness, with the older sister seeing her pettiness over the computer as justified by a similar situation where the OP was just as petty and disrespectful of the older sister's belongings, and so one. Given the extremely childish behavior of these two so-called \"adults\", this would be on-brand for OP.", "[deleted]", "We can acknowledge the housing crisis and the high cost of living while also aknowledging that it's not unreasonable to say a *33-year-old* should be able to put some effort into finding a place to live other than their mother's house.", "The US has a housing crisis, but I doubt OP is in the US. She calls her mom \"mum\", and her and her sister still living at home at late 20s, early 30s, as people have pointed out, that's more common in other cultures, but I do get a foreign vibe. But of course the foreign cultural thing could be an alternative explanation for unmarried grown daughters not being able to move out.", "A lifetime doesn't start at 28...", "Absolutely not.", "Did you add 15 years to everyone\u2019s age? ESH and you suck in particular for making me read this high school drama shit.", "ESH\n\nYou are both too old to be behaving like this.  Keep the receipt and if sister breaks it again, sue her. \n\nYou mom should throw you both out if this is typical behavior.", "> I am convinced my mother doesn\u2019t believe me what happened that night and that is why she has never said anything to her about it.\n\nYou're both adults. Why would you expect your mother to say something to your sister about it?\n\nYou're clearly not happy living with your mother and sister. Move out. ESH - your mother for taking sides, your sister for being spiteful, and you for screaming.", "YTA. There is no evidence that your mother didn't believe you. You are an adult it isn't your mother's job to mediate petty arguments between 2 grown adults. Your mother stayed out of it and your bewilideringly childish response is that you will NEVER FORGIVE HER. That's hilariously childish. It's comical. But not befitting an adult and that's why over either of those two you are the asshole. \n\nYour sister is also an asshole but your response to your mother who didn't wreck your laptop or even say she believes your sister is why you are the primary asshole for this particular situation. For the ice cream wrapper you could ask your mother to help you out because you are having a difficult situation with your sister but having a tantrum instead isn't helpful.\n\nAlso tea, unless it has a bunch of stuff in it doesn't generally destroy a laptop if you shut it off and let it dry out. But anyways don't keep your laptop where your sister will ever touch it. Treat it as though your sister is a toddler (like she's acting) and don't expect your mother to deal with your issues anymore. If you can move out and cut off your sister that might be a path down the road. I'm not saying your family is innocent. Obviously it took time for you guys to end up the way you are as grown children rather than adults. So in general ESH but for this very specific situation I still feel like you're a bigger AH.", ">I bought a computer for study a few months ago. About 2 years ago my sister spilled tea all over it,\n\nWhat?", "You brought a computer a couple of months ago, and your sister managed to spill tea on it 2 years ago?

One is 33 and the other is 28!!!", "I know, I love my parents so much- they are great. However, when I visit them at my childhood home for too long, I become a sulky, petulant 13-year-old again. It\u2019s painful.", "Extended family living is really normal in this day and age and YOU need to stop shaming people and mind your business.", "You do know that not all cultures behave like Americans do, where you move out at 18, right? There are actually other places with different norms outside the boundaries of the US and Europe...", "...because of this...?", "Do you scream and cry over ice-cream wrappers? My nephews (30 and 27) live at home too but they are functional adults and act their age.  Sister loves having her kids around and they get to save cash for buying a house someday.   \n\n\nNothing wrong with living at home so long as it doesn't make you regress into completely childish behavior like OP and her sister.", "Um, I see one person throwing stuff and the other person being victimized. Someone needs to hold the older sister accountable. It sounds like she's the golden child. NTA. Your mom needed to hear it and you were defending your property from a bully.", "come on, does OP really need to spell out this is frustration building over 2 years & 2 decades ?  \n\nThe first destroyed computer is an easy point of reference, but the mother's non-intervention aka indifference has been going on so much longer.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike, my parents split when I was 15 and my brother 12. He bought into my abusive father's teary promises of change, so he stayed with him. Ever since, my mother bent over backwards to please him and make sure he had a safe place and a reference for normality... she still does.  \n\nOne of the consequences : they both called me a bitch because I didn't want to do the washing-up on my own for the birthday dinner my mom threw for my 30th. Expecting him to help was too much to ask, even on my birthday.   \n\nIt took me till I was 30 before I stopped being angry over this pattern of treatment & till I was 35 before I could laugh about it & love both of them freely.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wager OP is in the same situation.", "I think this is just a part of a toxic dynamic that has probably been going on since they were children.", "I went deepdive on OP's last month of posts, in a post they say they are autistic.. it would very much explain what might look like an adult overreaction.\n\nYou are right, there could be a vicious cycle of tit-for-tat, but there's something about it that sets off my injustice alarm. DARVO (Deny-attack-reverse-victim/offender) is a manipulative tactic and if you know their buttons (ie prized possessions), it could be very effective in setting off a meltdown in an autistic person."]}
