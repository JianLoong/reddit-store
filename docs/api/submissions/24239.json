Not sure why they haven't yet.", "Some people can\u2019t afford to constantly buy hundreds of dollars in laptops and a lot of people can\u2019t afford rent", "And not every culture is western. I think some people, particularly Americans, think all of reddit live by their standards. In some cultures, women don't move out until they are married.", "yeah the hispanic american culture im from is fine with kids staying a long time for example.\n\nthat said 28 and 33 with full time jobs is a bit unusual even for us.\n\nbut that aside even for adults its not unreasonable to be upset when someone believes a liar", "Actually, pretty much every culture apart from post-1940s USA has people generally stay with their parents until they have a good reason not to. You only get people moving out almost immediately when you have massive expansion of the housing and jobs markets, but it's what boomers grew up with so it's what they think is normal.\n\nIt's like how we think of Christmas as snowy almost entirely because there was a cold snap through Dickens' childhood.", "I think you forgot about the Greek insolvency issue from a decade ago that almost collapsed the EU.   Tons of national debt was wiped out in complex refinancing schemes which are still having broad effects on the economy.    Gonna be awhile before that country can actually climb onto equal footing with other countries in the EU.", "Probably because she enabled sister acting like this all through their childhoods. It\u2019s almost certainly a pattern, not a one-off.", "Clearly not OPs sister. The only way to get through to them, is display the same behaviour back.", "Yeah no one HAS to do anything. It is just the way forward if OP wants peace of mind.\n\nThey are 28 and 33 not 8 and 13.", "Dude WHAT? Scandinavia, esp. Sweden (at least last time I checked), top the charts when it comes to this. The US isn't even close.", "I think you forgot Europe, or at least big parts of it. I left home at 18 to share an apartment with a friend. Most of my friends did. It\u2019s not like you go from home to living on your own but yeah, it\u2019s standard in many places outside US to try living as an adult before you absolutely have to.", "[deleted]", "Ah yes, how could I forget? /s Seriously though, low salaries have been a thing in Greece for as long as I can remember. And I can remember back to 1997.", "[deleted]", "The only way OP is getting peace of mind is moving away from those assholes and going low contact. They don't deserve forgiveness. Especially the sister who continues to spite her for her dumbass mistake that she took no accountability for.", "OK, but shifting to shared living without your parents is still different to getting your own individual place", "I know...back in the day, THAT is how generational wealth was built.\n\nFamily home was inherited, one child would stay home, care for the aging parents, handle upkeep, repairs, while not having to come up with a rent/mortgage payment...granny died in the house surrounded by her loved ones & the house did not go to the state for her nursing home bills. \n\nThis is how my grandparents played it, how my parents played it, and how I'm playing it.", "a 33 and 28 year old aren\u2019t kids. I understand what you\u2019re saying, but it is irrelevant in this poster\u2019s case", "Why? Because they're fighting as if they're children!  They're not kids, they're adults.", "Because they both act like 10 year olds. Once they move out, their personalities can develop and they can become adults. They're all in a state of arrested development, and OP can't even leave a room without his belongings being tampered with by his awful sister. Op is screaming at his mother, who calls them animals. This isn't working for anyone.", "It\u2019s necessary for these people", "Because they\u2019re relying on their mother to deal with their childish arguments. There is nothing wrong with living at home at any age, just remember to act that age.", "Why? Because these 2 girls act like they're still teens. They haven't been allowed to mature like living in the real world makes you grow up fast. They are still in the same relationship dynamic since high school.", "Because if this is a case between 12 and 14 yo they\n\na) Not fully mature\n\nb) CAn't move out\n\nc) Really need to rely on parents for mediation\n\nd) They don't truly earn money, and  thus can't cover the property damage.", "It very much is", "That's a stupid analogy because this isn't a burning house. In the same analogy, if you touch a stove and it's hot, you won't touch it again. If it never hurts you, you'll keep touching it.\n\nAlso go rent her a house if moving out is so easy. It isn't so easy to move out in a lot of cases.", "Yeah based on the one dimensional picture that the internet sees... sure.", "Yes, but not really the point here, don\u2019t you think?\n\nIn Northern Europe you move out of your parents house pretty early.

But the important part is getting out from under your parents\u2019 wing (and roof), for the sake of your own independence and personal growth.

She's doing it to his laptop, but there's no mention of him doing similar to her stuff.", "I mean... I can see what they kean herr.  This very much reads like the exact kind of petty bs you see in adult siblings who have never struck out as adults. They are continuing the toxic dynamic of their childhood. Its a specific flavor of unhinged that very much can be traced back to not moving out. Not everyone who never moves out has this problem, obviously, but i can see the connection.", "Normal people don't get posted here though", "The sister is the asshole but what is OP accomplishing by losing their mind like this? This is what their dynamic with their sister is like. This is what the dynamic with the sister will always be like until they stop sharing a roof. \n\nMove out, don't move out, sister to blame, mother to blame, OP to blame, doesn't matter. This is a sick dynamic they have going and something needs to change.\n\nOP is demanding that the mother mediate their disputes still despite their advanced ages. I mean...has OP paused to.tnink now screwed up that is?", "This is the issue of emotional abuse, it is the death of 1000 papercuts. This particular papercut was the one to send OP onto actually releasing her feelings - which have been ignored, belittled or denied for likely, her lifetime. \n\nWhen you grow up under this kind of influence, it is incredibly difficult to get out of it, especially when OP is manipulated and guilted for trying to prove her needs are real. Sadly, OP is still under the belief that if she explains her situation in the \"right way\", her mother will come to understand her perspective. \n\nIf you reached out to a loved one and constantly had your hand slapped back, and told that you're too sensitive because you're upset about your sore hand - just get over it, it wouldn't occur to you that the pain was inflicted - only that you're too sensitive and it must be your fault. But even as adults, we continue to reach out for the approval of those that slapped us because we've been trained to.", "Move out with what money and where? Being able to afford a computer doesn't necessarily mean someone can afford rent.
