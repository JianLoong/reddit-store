If no one died and no one injured it can be fixed and you learn to move on, which you need to move on by moving out and living your own life where you are around people you currently dislike. \nIts that or you have a mature conversation with your mum, apologise for shouting at her (even if you disagree), and get to the bottom of what happened to your laptop.

That's a really shitty thing to say to your mom over a material object. I could understand if your sisters lies harmed you in anyway or they beat you or..literally anything other than this.", "NTA. Your frustration about your sister damaging your computer is valid. While emotions ran high, effective communication is crucial. Express your feelings calmly, focusing on finding a solution. Set boundaries for your belongings in a constructive way to avoid escalation. It's vital to discuss the incident with your sister, explaining its impact and hearing her side. Holding onto grudges can harm your well-being, so consider forgiveness for your own peace of mind. Instead of saying you'll never forgive your mother, express your feelings openly about needing her support. Family dynamics are complex; seeking a healthier approach to conflicts can lead to better resolutions and relationships.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
