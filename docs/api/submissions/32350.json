Our family in general was always very close.\n\n  \nThe cousin (28F) I'm having a problem with was always one of my (and my brother's (30M)) best friends, I'm going to call her M. Even with all the cousins being close there is always one there is closer and she was one of mine. Well, three years ago my brother started dating my SIL (26F) and M was since the beginning a bit standoffish with her.\n\n  \nIn the beginning, I thought it was just because my SIL was new in our life, family, and friend group since my brother would take her to our outings. But as I became closer with my SIL she told me that M said and did mean things to her sometimes.\n\n  \nThings like greeting every single person on a table except for my SIL, or giving her backhanded compliments in front of family, all things there are subtle but hurt my SIL.\n\n  \nI talked to SIL and she didn't want me to expose our convo but she was okay with me talking to M if I left our conversation out, so that's what I did. At the time M just said that thinking she didn't like SIL was in my head. Since then my friendship with M kinda became more distant. We still talk at family events, but mostly our outings and girls' nights were slowly left behind.\n\n  \nBesides M started dating and is currently engaged, to get married in January, and her daily life also changed. \n\n  \nNow fast forward to this weekend, MY BROTHER'S WEDDING!!! What an incredible day, everything was amazing, except for M. At the end of the part SIL told me that M pulled my brother aside after the ceremony and told him he could have done better, but she would still stand by him because that's what you do with the people you love, but she had to say this to him.\n\n  \nMy brother told SIL, and SIL told me and I was furious. But I didn't want to cause a scene at their wedding, so I just ignored it, even tho I was fuming on the inside.\n\n  \nWell, yesterday I sent a private message to M saying I wouldn't be her bridesmaid anymore and I didn't want to keep contact with her, that we could avoid each other at the family events for all I cared because I could never forget someone doing something like this to my family. Then I left the wedding group chat and blocked her.\n\n  \nWell, her parents, brother, and a few cousins are blowing up my phone saying I was an AH for leaving her hanging, leaving her wedding party, for trying to break the family apart. My grandma called me and said that nothing made her sadder than seeing her family being divided.\n\n  \nI don't care tho. My parents of course took SIL's side, and since they aren't mad at me, my aunt and uncle also stopped talking with them.\n\n  \nI have a close friend who is also engaged and she understood me but told me that I was an AH for leaving M's wedding party on short notice.\n\n  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701721045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18at6v5/aita_for_quitting_being_my_cousins_bridesmaid_on/", "score": 1349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After a long thing I'd actually probably go with YTA. Ultimately I'd say you're fighting battles that aren't really yours to fight without knowing the *why* behind everything.\n\nAccording to SIL, M was cordial and occasionally even passive aggressive but not to the point where anything was really too obvious. M didn't talk badly about SIL to you however at all and  even explicitly said she didn't dislike her-- this is someone you've known your whole life, why wouldn't you trust them more than a newcomer is sort of my perspective. M had a private conversation with her own close friend/cousin saying she supported him even if at the end of the day she didn't care for the wife (again for undisclosed reasons).\n\nI don't know why SIL or your brother haven't publicly stood up for SIL if they felt M was so egregious, why it's been you defending after hearing SIL talk badly about M (whereas M didn't do the same about SIL ever to you...). Why this is allegedly the first instance where it's called out, and how it can go from 0 to 100 real quick, from you being her bridesmaid and close friend to suddenly cutting contact? It seems really drastic and like you are sticking up for people that aren't even sticking up for themselves this hard. Grandma is right, there is a **huge** rift now being created which seems like somewhat of a moutain made out of a molehill. If I were grandma I'd think that SIL is sure stirring up a lot of drama and has definitely created a wedge between all three of you who have been close for your whole life over perceived slights (which may or may not even be true).\n\nM had one private conversation that was indeed rude with her close friend/cousin for her whole life, and occasional passive aggressiveness allegedly but didn't talk badly about SIL to you ever, whereas it sounds like SIL talked very badly about M to you and constantly brought up things. No wonder you guys stopped having girls nights as much. I would probably dislike SIL too if I were in M's shoes at this point and feel sad that SIL successfully put a wedge in the entire family.\n\nSIL sounds like the source of all of this drama and like the problem. Things *were* fine with your whole family before she came along and started whispering about how M wasn't cool and you just...went with it? Even after M privately said she had no qualms with SIL? I bet M is just disappointed that someone she was close to with birth was so willing to think badly about her at the drop of a hat from someone that might've been jealous of your close bond...How can you just abandon your cousin/best friend over a new person making allegations without any proof?  It sounds like SIL just wanted M out to have more of your brother's attention & used you to help her get what she wanted. That's just how it seems from how you've written it here.", "~~ESH - M shouldn't be treating your SIL this way. But you also don't know if there's a reason behind it, like you didn't have a conversation with her or anything even though you were supposed to. And TBH it's a bit of an asshole move to cancel last minute the way that you did. You could have been an adult and told her that you don't appreciate the way that she treats your SIL, and that if it continues / or even because of that you don't care to have any contact with her after her wedding. The wedding is less than a month away.~~\n\nNTA - You tried to have a conversation with M about her behavior toward SIL and she basically gaslighted you saying the SIL was putting stuff in your head.", "ESH - your cousin for obvious reasons. You for immediately going on the warpath with your cousin instead of trying to get to the bottom of why she hates your SIL. (You tried once but it sounds like it was a long time ago, and now that she 'exposed' her hate to your brother with what she told him, you should've asked her WHY)", "I think YTA. Weddings are big days, and just like you respected your brothers, it\u2019s mature to do the same for your cousin. This is your character, not your cousin. You don\u2019t need to go down to her level. I also still feel like if your cousin has been in your life for so much longer and was your best friend, there could\u2019ve been a better way to settle the tension between M and your SIL. I feel like the mature thing is to have a deeper conversation as to why she felt the way she does towards your SIL. And what can you do going forward to fix them. Did M invite SIL to her wedding?? What if SIL was lying or SIL was being overdramatic? Do you believe your cousin, your ex best friend, would do this? It was a big step you took to defend your SIL and I bet your SIL is appreciative but it gives M more reasons to dislike your SIL.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think the reason the family has broken up is there are two sides of the story. It seems it's the rest of the family including grandma know a different side of the story but since everyone is", "Totally fair and I appreciate it, I understand my view isn't the most popular one and hopefully I'm wrong and you've stood up for the underdog. I just feel there's some missing reasons still; if you were so close since birth to this cousin I would be digging in a little deeper to know if there was truly anything wrong before it came to this; standing up in the little moments before it culminated in such a strong reaction. I just would not be able to be that deadset on defending SIL without really digging deeper into M's motivation.\n\nThe people saying she may have a crush might be onto something, that was genuinely never something that came to mind (because you are close first cousins!), or the classism, but I don't know if not that..., there just *has* to be some reason for M's behavior. \n\n>I love my brother more than anything, and if he chooses her, unless she gives me a reason not to love her, I love her with all my heart, because she is good to him and because she is now his family. For me to love her is to love him and the life he chose for himself.\n\nAs childhood friends with a close bond with M too, would this be something you'd previously assume she'd feel too? Did your brother have any other serious girlfriends besides SIL beforehand, if so how did she treat them? If yes and well, then I'd doubt it's actually a crush. I'm just trying to assume if you were so close to M to consider her one of your ***best*** friends for life and never really had issues before SIL came into the picture, if the possibility that she gave M a reason not to love her. You describe SIL as the sweetest person you've ever met but how would you have described M prior to all of this? Does M have a history of being snarky or is this the first time? If it was the first time I again really would just be hesitant to assume that M who you've known and been close to your whole entire life suddenly changed in this one instance. Again, you know them best and can judge better than anyone else on the internet these family dynamics, it just feels like there's a huge gap of very relevant info missing.\n\nIt's good that you are so fiercely defensive of your brother, I just hope for everyone's sake given what's already gone down that the *missing reason* is something like M being petty/classist to justify it all and not something like SIL being secretly deceptive because in that case an irreparable wedge has been driven into the family by an interloper... I just hope it was all worth it. One thing stays the same though, let your loved ones fight their own battles. Getting in the middle doesn't do much except exacerbate problems. Standing up would've been a lot better publicly in front of family when she made quips rather than privately sending the nuke after being seemingly perfect with eachother that you're dropping out of the wedding and never speaking again.", "Yes, I get that she told her why but I'm saying why wasn't there a conversation before it got \"I no longer want to speak to you\". However, I just reread the whole thing and she says she did talk to M and that M said that SIL was just getting into her head. So I will edit my post. Thank you for pointing that out.", "That's the vibe I got too. M wants OPs brother.

When he defended his fiance, the SIL cut him off....then his sister....then their dad. This all happened when we were in our 30s beginning to form our own families. \n\nMy guess is she is used to controlling the family group and people getting married threaten that. Her family probably has always defended her in general and they are unlikely to rein her in. \n\nYou have the choice of placating her to keep a relationship but she'll probably in the end make you choose between her and your SIL as she seeks to remain in control and the center of attention.", "Did anyone stop to also state that M is the asshole who got this ball rolling?\n\nIt\u2019s always this way.

If your brother and SIL are an interracial couple, it would make sense why M is like that. It's wrong but at least then you know why. It's the only thing I can think of and if that is the case, it makes M a huge AH instead of just a regular AH.\n\n\nEdit: just found the comment where you said SIL is from a lower income family.

SIL was being mean to M, so she just said that he can do better. He should not have said anything but kept it to himself. Then you heard and dropped out of M's wedding without fully talking to her and giving her a chance to explain herself? That is wrong, you owe at least that much to your cousin. You know how she felt.

Of course, cousin's mom and dad don't think their daughter is doing anything wrong. You can't change their mind, so don't bother.

They should, but they are not as close to it as you are.", "More info please.  Did you talk to your brother first and confirm what your cousin had said to him about SIL?  Do the rest of the family now know what your cousin said to your brother about his new wife?  Before blocking her did you ask her why she doesn't like your brother's wife?", "What if your Sil is playing you like a violin? Maybe she was jealous of the relationship you had with your cousin.

He didn't tell me until like 10 years later.", "he deff could\u2019ve waited till after the honeymoon to relay that particular message. i do have to give it up to him though for being an upstanding husband by immediately letting his wife know that his cousin is an opp.", "Her brother said that their cousin personally told him he could do better, about his bride, on his wedding day. Could he have lied? Yeah....but why would he?", "Yeah, I\u2019ve witnessed some pretty messed up things with a new person in a group seeming to think they have to push someone else out to make a space for themselves.

Even now, it\u2019s never really gone back to how it was before.\n\nI\u2019m team trust-but-verify. A detailed conversation with the cousin would give an idea of how she thinks she\u2019s acting and whether there\u2019s more than one interpretation of events.

Get someone who\u2019s not SIL to confirm first-person that this is actually happening.", "But the aStHEtiC", "I am trying to work out why the brother would tell SIL? If they had a relationship sure, but shouldn't he know they don't get along.

OP didn't hear it directly from him.", "The only thing I'm questioning is whether your brother told you exactly what M said at the wedding or if you took what SIL said as perfect truth? \n\nThe only reason that I ask is that I have seen things be manipulated and triangulated so damn hard. I've seen the \"perfect couple\" turned into an abusive mess because no one actually fact checked. And this is not gender specific at all. The sweet, shy one and the charismatic, helpful one can be the same as the abusive, AH one (and they can be anyone, including your SIL or cousin).", "From your post and just your words alone, it seems like YTA.
