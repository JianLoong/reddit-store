My sister wants to have everything in order so if something happens to her, her kids will be taken care of.\n\nOur parents are in their 70s and I'm the only sibling she has, so she asked if my husband and I would be willing to take the kids if the need arose. We probably could afford it, money isn't the real issue. What is the problem is that my husband and I don't want children, we're both sterilized and we feel we've taken enough precautions to enjoy a childfree life. I don't dislike my nieces, but I'm not close with them and certainly don't want to raise them.\n\nSo we turned my sister down, telling her we weren't an option. She got upset, we don't really have any other family who could take them , so they'd have to go into the system. I told her that's unfortunate, but isn't really my concern since I didn't have them. She called me coldhearted and hasn't spoken to me since.", "created_utc": 1677093065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1198ah6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_wouldnt_take_care_of/", "score": 1067, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your sister dies young, the absolute minimum you could do to honor her would be to keep her children out of the foster system.", "NTA. You have no obligation to take her kids even if you're the only option. It's sad they would go into foster care but again, you have no legal obligation to them and no one can force you to take them. You definitely could have been nicer telling her though so you do get a few AH points", "YTA\n\nThe chance of something happening before the kids are able to be independent is miniscule. If anything DID happen, your heart would be willing to do anything to help. Sis knows you don't want kids, yet she chose to ask you over everyone else, because you are still the best choice! Your selfishness is astounding.", "YTA. At least now your family knows how selfish you are and that you are unavailable for emergencies.  They can choose to give you the same level of care should you ever find yourself in an emergency. \n\nI\u2019m so curious to know what your parents think about all this. If I found out that\u2019s how one of my children were treating their siblings, I would be extremely disappointed and would likely cut them out of my will and end of life decisions.", "nta\n\nLots of people are saying yta for allowing them to go into care but what is the alternative? Them going into your home and being resented for the rest of their lives because both you and your husband don't want children? \n\nYou're being responsible and realistic about the situation.", "YTA just because it is a terrible way to treat family. And if these are the decisions you want to make, thats fine. But then you must accept youre the asshole you know? I get it, you dont want kids. But asking strangers for validation is silly. If you treat family like shit, you must accept that people are going to look at you sideways, your nieces will likely not care for you in old age or have any relationship with you, and that your sister and family will judge you. Thats the price we pay when we make decisions, any decisions really.", "Nah oof. Although I am child free I would still take on my neices if their parents passed.  HOWEVER,  I know that kids aren't for everyone and it's better she know now so she can plan.", "NTA. I would have done the exact same thing OP. I'm a 25 year old sterilized woman with no kids and I actively plan on having none for the rest of forever.

Now she can choose someone that will care for her children in the horrible event that she can\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t understand people\u2019s selfishness or entitlement. No you didn\u2019t choose to have children, but how could you let those innocent babies go into the foster system? \n\nSometimes things in life happen that take choice out of our hands. We have to take care of each other", "NTA. You get to choose what happens to your life.", "Isn\u2019t that the role of the godparents normally assuming your family practices that as part of your culture?

But telling your sister that was not an asshole move--that's info she needs so she can figure out what she needs to do in her estate planning.\n\nThat being said, the person appointed guardian of minor children is not necessarily the person in whose home those kids live. The guardian's job would be to figure out the best placement for the kid, which could mean living with a paternal relative or a friend's family. So a relative without the ability to take physical custody (an elderly or disabled person, for example) could still be named guardian. (A relative who would consign a three-year-old to foster care would probably be a shitty choice though.)", "YTA - I completely support people choosing not to have children however, you're saying you'd rather your nieces go into foster care than inconvenience yourself and help your family. That's f-ed up. \n\nAnd personally, my BIL and his partner are childfree but adore my children, spend tons of time with them, and have agreed to take them if something were to happen. Just because you don't choose to have kids doesn't mean you have to be a dick.", "NTA. You and your husband chose child free lifestyle for a reason. Children should only be taken in by those who want them and love them. In this case it\u2019s not you.

Yes it\u2019s not the gameplan. But in tragic circumstances, you should help your blood.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that the courts would allow it to skip dad before you. Him not having custody is not the same as not having parental rights. But that\u2019s a side issue.", "Soft YTA. As another happily child free person who dislikes children for the most part, I still can't imagine saying no to something like this. When my mom and dad asked me to be guardian of my young siblings (large age gap), I readily agreed. Sure, the child free person should be your last ask for stuff like this, but I could never live with myself if I let my family go into the system when I could prevent it. I know not everyone's family is all the close, but I just can't imagine being so unwilling to make sacrifices in dire situations for the people I care about. \n\nI say you're a soft ah because she shouldn't still be pushing the issue after you said no. If you feel strongly enough about this that you would rather the kids go into the system, then you absolutely should not be the guardian of these kids, but that still makes you an AH, in my opinion.", "NTA. could have been nicer about it but their father should take them because he helped make them", "NTA for not wanting the responsibility of another person's kids, but she's right about you being cold hearted.  \n\nOne thing about tables is that they always turn.  You never know when/if you'll need her for something and you won't be able to ask or expect help from her because you've ruined your relationship over something that very likely won't even happen. If I were her I wouldn't want anything else to do with you. You may end up with a sister free life as well as a child free one.", "YTA. She wasn't trying to dump her kids on you, she wasn't asking for help or sympathy. She wanted to know her kids wouldn't perish in case she, you know, died. What kind of person would stand there and say \"my sister's children will have to go into the system\".   Yiiikes. I am that naive, but I would readily take in even a  neighbor's kid if it would prevent them from going to a children's home.", "NTA\n\nnot your kids not your problem", "YTA. Sometimes life is inconvenient and you don't get what you want. Sometimes you become disabled. Sometimes your partner does. Sometimes shit gets hard. Life is only livible if we actually look out for each other and are willing to put our preferences aside for one another's survival. The fact that you would be willing to send children you love into the foster system is legitimately horrible.", "My God, Reddit makes me concerned for humanity. NO ONE can survive in the world with the toxic hyper-individualism that AITA espouses. We cannot make it on this Earth alone. Babies need parents, children need guidances, adults need jobs, etc. We HAVE to rely on each other to get through life. That's why humans naturally form families, communities, and friends. We need each other.\n\nThe unabated selfishness that's being promoted by the N T A-ers here is disgusting. \"Who cares about kids going into the foster system, OP owes no one anything!!! Do you OP, go live your life yaaaaasss queen!!!!\" Jesus Christ. I hope you remember that when you inevitably one day have to rely on the support of another person.\n\nI am childfree. I plan to stay that way. But I'd take in my nieces and nephews in a heart beat. They're beautiful innocent children who have done nothing wrong in this world. I'd give them the shirt off my back in order to give them a shot at a good life. I wish someone did the same for me as a child. \n\nEveryone will say that OP isn't obligated to do anything for those kids. That she deserves happy luxurious child-free life, and that it's worth it even if those children have to suffer. No one is technically obligated to do anything in this world, short of abiding by the law. So fine OP, you don't owe anyone anything.\n\nBut that the idea of your orphaned nieces getting chucked into foster care doesn't make your stomach churn? That you could happily live in a nice house and enjoy a child free life with your husband without feeling any guilt or motivation to help them?\n\nYeah, you're a flaming AH. YTA a million times.", "You\u2019re well within your rights to choose but yeah YTA. \n\nYour sister has asked you, someone she clearly trusts very deeply to take on her children should the absolute worst happen to her. Something that very well may never happen to her until she\u2019s old and grey and they are well into their adult years. Not only did you refuse to protect your nieces, you\u2019ve point blank said you do not care if they end up in a foster system that literally destroys lives. How you could be so cold and careless for your niece\u2019s is beyond me.\n\nI\u2019d bet money that your nieces love you unreservedly. If you\u2019re a good aunt to them you\u2019re probably their favourite person in the world (because parents are very rarely #1 when they\u2019re young because you make them do horrible things like go to bed, clean up and what not) \nImagine you lost your mum, you\u2019re devastated and beside yourself and now you find out that your grandparents physically can\u2019t take you and your aunt won\u2019t because she\u2019s so anti child. It\u2019d probably break their hearts even more.\n\nI\u2019d do anything for my nephews. Even if I didn\u2019t have kids I\u2019d take them in without a second thought because those boys mean the world to me. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re entitled to your decision and your feelings on the matter but that doesn\u2019t make you less an AH for it. Your sister is also well within her rights to not speak to you. She feels hurt and betrayed by not only your refusal but your attitude towards your own family members.", "Well. Whether yta or not, I hope you\u2019re not planning to have a good relationship with your sister from now on. You just told her you don\u2019t care about the people who are most precious to her in her life.", "\u201cI\u2019m so selfish that I would prefer my nieces be put into an abusive system rather than be responsible for them.\u201d\n\nThere, I fixed it for you, AH. And I hope your sister abandons you when you need help in the future. I mean, it\u2019s not her problem right?", "NTA. What she should be doing instead is make sure to have life insurance and put away enough money to support her daughters should something happened to her before they are adults.  She then can ask someone she knows that are willing to be their guardian should something happens to her.  Just because you're her only sibling does not make you the default in taking care of her children.", "I can see it two ways... \n\nESH, do they not have any close friends that are more child-friendly?\n\nBut also YTA, would you not them rather go to you than go into foster care? What if they were like 16 and only had a few years in your care? Obviously it would be a big lifestyle adjustment but you really don't care enough for your nieces to take them in if something terrible happened?? If you're so focused on being childfree, you can't take this what-if scenario, then maybe they're better off without you taking care of them.", "NAH. You don\u2019t want children so probably wouldn\u2019t be able to provide a happy home for them if they did come to you, which from what you\u2019ve said sounds like an extremely remote possibility. She wants to make sure her children will be cared for if the worst should happen which any responsible parent should do. The lack of appropriate support network sucks but it is what it is.\n\nIt would be a good idea to talk about other ways you may be able to help. If there is a Life Insurance policy for example, the money could be held in trust and you could approve expenses for their care up to x age at which time the full amount will be released to them.", "YTA, not for your choice to not take the children, but for how you handled the situation. \n\nSaying that your nieces aren't really your concern is incredibly cold hearted (even if its a true statement). You should apologize for the things you said.\n\nI don't know what your relationship is like or what relationship you want with your sister, nieces and parents but this is the sort of things people may not get over. \n\nI hope you never have a situation where you need help from your family, they may remember this moment if you do.", "NAH- you are not responsible for your sisters kids and if children aren\u2019t something you want in your life then that\u2019s your decision. But you making this decision comes with consequences and those are that your relationship with your sister and her family, and possible your parents as well, is going to be severely damaged because of this. \n\nAs someone who is child free myself, i know that while I may not want children, but in the event that my sibling dies and leaves their kids orphaned then it is something that will trump my aversion to motherhood. I love my siblings and my nieblings enough to go through the discomfort of taking care of children when I don\u2019t want to. Telling your sister that you won\u2019t take her kids if she dies is sending the message that your personal comfort is more important to you than her and her children. I too would think twice about my relationship with a sibling if they told me that even though they had the means that if i died they would send my kids to the foster system because they don\u2019t want children.", "Difficult as you obviously have the right to live your life as you want and children are not part of your plan, but I can't imagine personally ever saying no to family children if they were orphaned or my friends kids for that matter. It feels pretty cold. Nobody would choose to have their life derailed by taking on the responsibility of kids unplanned, but they do it because its the compassionate thing to do as a human if those children have literally noone else! So, yeah. On balance YTA", "YTA\n\nA lot of the n-t-a votes are saying \u201ctHeY cHosE a ChiLdFrEe lIFe\u201d, and while true, I\u2019m betting the sister isn\u2019t choosing to die soon. Yea, OP chose not to have kids, but sister isn\u2019t asking about taking in the kids when she doesn\u2019t feel like being a mom anymore. She\u2019s asking if it came down to it, if tragedy hits, would OP step up and help the family out. And OP said it\u2019s \u201cnot their problem\u201d. Yikes.\n\nYes, legally, OP is not obligated to take the kids in, but morally, YTA.\n\nThanks for helping me feel tremendously grateful for my family and sibs, i know without a doubt that if i had kids and passed away they would step up and provide a good life for my kiddos.", "i\u2019m gonna go with YTA. you\u2019d rather see your nieces go through the system? do you not know how traumatic the system is for kids?", "That's fucked up.  YTA.", "NTA like you said you don't dislike them, that does not even remotely sound like you love them. Someone taking in children under worst case scenarios need to be fully accepting of the children and at least want to love them. As a mother I would much rather someone give me the answer of no than say yes even though they really would not want my kids. In that situation you need to be fully prepared for the worst type of parenting because the trauma this kids will be going threw will need more help and guidance than even having your own kids.", "YTA! Wtf is wrong with you? They are your nieces!!!", "YTA- for telling your single mother sister that if she dies her kids- your nieces,  will go into the system so you can enjoy your child free life.", "YTA. I wouldn't put a DOG in the foster system, let alone my own family. In your sister's place I would 100% go NC too. I don't want any more kids, but when my SIL went to rehab, guess what I did?

You showed your sister that you have no regard for her, why should she waste any more energy on you?", "YTA", "Information: No family on dad's part?", "Nta hon.", "So your question is \u201cAITA for telling your sister\u201d - in that part you certainly seemed to deliver that response in an AH way yes.

Does your sister have to like your response - nope, and will it effect your relationship - yep it will. \n\nChances are it doesn\u2019t matter that your parents are in their 70\u2019s, they will probably feel that they need to step up because you won\u2019t.", "her choice to have children is not your responsibility.\n\nNTA\n\nAlthough not caring if they go into the system is sad on your part since they are your blood but albeit NTA", "NTA but yikes. I understand you and your husband not wanting children, but if it really came down to it, would you actually put your nieces into foster care if your sister passed? As a child of a single mother my greatest fear was her dying and me having to be raised by family as they were fundamentally religious and my whole life would\u2019ve been very different. However I didn\u2019t have to worry about ending up in a terrible foster home at least. So while you\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting the kids, it\u2019s pretty heartless to let your nieces go into the system if your sister dies. Again, yikes.", "NTA.

I can\u2019t wrap my head around letting children I love be put into a potentially abusive and traumatizing system and give zero F\u2019s about it. If their mom did pass, it seems you would be their only real family left potentially.

In one hand you\u2019re NTA for not wanting kids, and it is completely your choice. This is obviously an extreme circumstance. The system is a harsh, f*cked experience for kids.

I\u2019m not close to my nephew as we live far from my brothers family and I only see him once or twice a year but I would take him if he needed me no question. Conversely my SIL and BIL are happily childless by choice and also in their mid 50s but were not only honored to be listed as guardians to our children should something happen to us but my SIL said she\u2019d have fought for it. Because it\u2019s family. Sometimes life happens when we\u2019re busy making plans. And you are literally the only option.

Taking on children is a huge commitment and they deserve to be with people who are going to love them and support them as if they were their own. We picked our friends who would love to have them, are actively involved in their lives and already work with children. Plus other things, I wanted someone who lived close by, who would discipline in a similar manner, who would play with them, who knows how to cook, who enjoys camping and traveling because those are things I want for my children if I weren't around to take them.

It was your sisters choice to have children, not yours. \n\nHowever, she's not asking you to take care of her children NOW. Your sister is clearly worried and is trying to make sure everything is in order, just in case. That's a really loving and responsible thing to do.

Your sister is trying to guilt-trip you by talking about the absolute worst-case scenarios, but it's a massive leap from \"my sister won't take my kids\" to \"my kids will end up being abused in foster care\".

Definitely should have presented it more as caring about their well-being and knowing that you and your husband are not the best option for their long term well being. If they were older and she passed when they were almost adults, would you consider it? I think letting her know you don\u2019t feel your home would be the most loving space for children would be an okay way to gently share your stance. And if the kids were not children anymore and almost fully independent, if you were willing to help keep them out of the system just for their last teen years I\u2019m sure it would be a huge comfort to your sister. You are not obligated to do this of course, but I think if the issue is more with disliking children than anything else, this is a gentle kind way to present it.

The arguments for YTA are also invalid because you could use it for any couple who says they don\u2019t want to adopt? It\u2019s not your responsibility. Does your sister/her husband not have any close friends? What about the husband, does he not have any siblings?

Her baby daddy signed away his rights, if something was to happen to her you'd be sending kids into the foster care system. As someone who has worked with kids in the system, one of their biggest agonies is seeing family members turn them away. It sucks because we literally have no way to explain that one kindly. Like, yeah kid, you got abandoned by family...Yes, being in a home where you're not wanted also sucks, but it beats going to court as a minor, and basically having no one except some underpaid legal aid to advocate for you. If you're getting assaulted/bullied/abused, you're SOL. It's a thankless situation either way but gd your response was cold AF. You're essentially letting your sister know if she dies suddenly, you're not going to help. I would have a hard time having a relationship with a sibling who was just going to chump out when tragedy strikes. I get you dont want kids, but sometimes you have to pony up and do the right thing. If your sister gets cancer you're not going to take the kids for a while so she can try to get better? Really? Damn. Over money? I get it's a huge inconvenience, and no you didn't choose to have kids, but she can't just invent another caretaker for her children. \n\nIf you want to be the kind of person who sends two children who lost their only parent who gave a fuck into one of the most miserable systems we have in the US, go ahead.

I did not. OP did not. \n\n\"Do you know how hard it'll be like for them?\" \n\nSister should have thought about that before having them. Not my choice, not my consequences to face. \n\n\"Is the childfree lifestyle something you both definitely can't let go of to see another human being be happy?\"\n\nI literally could not say \"yes\" to this statement enough times. There is not a single scenario or alternate universe where I would EVER give up the childfree lifestyle for ANY child, relative or not, no matter how desperate a situation they're in. Again, I didn't choose to create them, they are not my responsibility. I'm assuming OP feels similarly.", "Pick a friend to do it. Don\u2019t subject your kids to being raised by someone that will resent them.", "So you want the kids to go to someone who doesn't want them and would resent the situation if forced to take them? Sounds like a great plan.", "...are you the sister??", "I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty. Kids have a mom and dad. Sis chose a shitty mate. Why in the world should op be responsible for sister and brother-in-law\u2019s poor choices? If sis passes, child services go to daddy first. He probably has relatives as well. Not OP\u2019s responsibility at all.", "Bro, exactly. I grew up in the system too. Going into the system they are much more prone to experience sexual abuse, drugs, and generally a much harder life... It ain't your duty, I understand where OP is coming from, but OP is cold as ice and if you were my sibling I'd never speak to you again. Cause at that point, were not even family.", "Yeah, the message was right, but the language could have been so much supportive.\n\n\"We might seem like the best option in that situation, and maybe in the short term we could manage,  but probably we are not the best people for your kids in the long term. We should figure out what to do for the long term. Let's do that now, together, when you are available and fully capable of telling us how to handle it\"", "I mean, It is coldhearted when it comes to family, and wanting to make sure family is taking care of.  This is also just a just in case, not a day to day care as long as mom is alive.   The reality is family should take care of family.  Doesn't always happen (heck rarely does).  So ya it is cold hearted, if realistic that she shouldn't care for the kids.  She also needs to understand that this is something that the sister really shouldn't be in much contact with her anymore about", "Because them wimminz is supposed to be all earthmothery and shit and are supposed to melt upon encountering a small child in need of parenting. \n\nThose of us who say \"nope, didn't want any of my own, not agreeing to have yours if you die\" are terrible horrible ladies who don't deserve the ladybits they may have gotten, and are bad humans who should feel shame. \n\nBecause if you don't want kids and wouldn't change your life for them, that means other people had that choice and if they're unhappy they made their beds, but that's not nice to think about. So better to demonize anyone who wouldn't make their choices. The cognitive dissonance goes away then.", "I think making false promises would be an AH move", "My sister asked me if I am okay with being guardian for my niece in case of emergency and I said no in the end. I am not mentally stable enough for giving a child that lost their parent temporarely or forever a good and loving home. It would be a nightmare for both of us. So better to look into other options now.   \nI really appreciate her trust in me, but I think she understood my reasoning cause she knows my struggle. I still feel like an AH so. :/", "Forcing a childless person to take care of children is cruel to both the person and the children involved. It is obvious the children would know they are not wanted. THAT is an ah move.", "That's fair and I would personally take them in her situation but something about the way she talks about the kids and her sister's situation makes me think that she would not be a good guardian to those kids anyways", "Completely agree. These are the kinds of discussions you should have before you have children.", "Why would someone prefer to put their young family members into a system historically full of abuse if they had a choice?\nDidn't say she was default caretaker I said it was fucking cold", "That\u2019s a really good point but not everyone gives their children godparents. I personally don\u2019t have godparents and neither do a lotta my friends and family.", "ah yes, I missed that part.  \n\nBut really, what about his parents and such? I'm sure they would be thrilled to meet / know they have grandchildren?  Maybe there's an aunt or uncle on that side. \n\nI've seen so many posts on Reddit in scenario's like this where the grand parents or others would LOVE to have contact, even if the sperm donor dips and signs away rights.", "It is really hard to do more harm than to your nieces than rejecting them after their parent died and sending them to the foster system. \n\nLike really hard.", "I imagine it\u2019s the thought of her girls being abused in foster care that\u2019s made her go \u2018overboard\u2019", "Having a plan set in line in case you die isn\u2019t going overboard, it\u2019s basic parenting.", "Making sure your children are taken care of in the event of your death is the responsible thing to do\u2014especially as a single parent without a big family. A slight chance is still a chance. \n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s overboard to cut contact with someone who has made it clear they don\u2019t care about you or your kids. Why foster a relationship with someone knowing it\u2019s one sided?", "That was my big thing. I remember multiple posts here about people who get in this situation and end up losing their marriage/relationship. If they both got sterilized, this would absolutely kill their marriage.", "it's not entitled to try to avoid your children going into foster care if you die.", "She doesn't have to, its just her sister isn't gonna like her in response. If I'm in a desperate situation and need help and my best friend refuses to help that's fine they're allowed to do that but I'm not gonna be friends with them anymore, at least not close friends. They've shown they don't care about me or my well being.", "As someone who was raised by people who didn\u2019t want them, and also spent time in the foster system, I can assure you the former is worse.", "Not all childfree couples are unwilling to do what it takes in the event of a tragedy.  My husband and I are childfree by choice.  I have a brother and a sister who both have 3 kids each.  My brother's wife died two years ago, so these kind of things do happen to people like us.  If anything happened to my brother we would absolutely move to their town and become legal guardians of my nieces.  Same if something happened to my sister and her husband.  But while all is well we'll all continue with our lives as they are.\n\nWe are also \"godparents\" to my aunt's cats.  So in the event of an unimaginable tragedy, we would find ourselves living in a new town with six kids, eleven cats and a dog.", "As a child-free person.....I would be willing to take on raising a few kids of a sibling or very close friend if god-forbid the worst happened. It's not an unreasonable ask.", "Because some childfree people would be willing to change their minds if it was an emergency, or if it was for someone they loved, or if they can\u2019t bear the thought of a child going from a loving home to a shitty foster system. None of these are factors when *choosing* not to have children, but if the child already exists, some people may make different choices.", "Doesn't sound like she has any other family.", "child free =/= anti child\n\nMy partner and I are child free, and happily have zero chance of ever having kids ourselves. But if any of our close friends or family's kids were suddenly orphaned, we would take them in without hesitation. Not everyone who is child free feels that way, but likewise not all of us are opposed to any kids under any circumstances.", "because in the event of her sudden death they would be her daughter's closest living relatives, and it is a reasonable thing to ask those individuals before making other arrangements? pretty common ask. If I had kids I would ask my child free sibling before I asked anyone else.", "In half of the houses I've lived in, my neighbor was an old woman complaining about her children never/rarely visiting. In the other half I didn't know my neighbors", "Definitely. I am expecting everyone saying \u2018she needs to think about how awful the system is\u2019 to have adopted at least one kid out of the system. Amazed at how many people are willing to give up their life whenever someone else needs, good for them!", "Don\u2019t need to I already promised my OWN sister that I\u2019ll take my nieces if something happens to her and her husband because their SAFETY and wellbeing outweighs my WANT to be childless.", "\"whynotboth.gif\"", "Exactly!! As a foster child you already feel unwanted, unloved, and like a burden to everyone around you. I can\u2019t understand reinforcing that feeling by refusing to help", "Precisely. Not taking the kids doesn\u2019t make you an A H. Kicking your family while they\u2019re down does. That\u2019s what most of the comments are missing.", "I didn\u2019t want kids and therefore I didn\u2019t have kids. I\u2019m 45, I have a demanding job, my life isn\u2019t set up for kids.

That doesn\u2019t suddenly make me an earth mother or whatever bullshit, it makes me a human making the best of a bad situation.", "Don\u2019t forget the other reason: because fAmiLy.  If they wouldn\u2019t want that couple to take care of the kids if they were not family, why ask them just because they are family?  It\u2019s the epitome of manipulation, guilting, and stupidity.", "But you shouldn\u2019t.  One of the reasons she trusted you was most likely because she knew you were honest and would say no if that\u2019s what needed to happen. You can\u2019t take care of someone else if you are struggling to care for yourself. Be kind to yourself.", "What do you mean \"forcing\"? Do you think her sister is looking to die so her children need to be taken care of by someone else? And do you genuinely think having to live with a relative of your parents is somehow more cruel than being tossed aside?\n\nI'd say NAH. Not your responsibility, and I can't say there's a good way of declining. But your sister is completely in her right to be upset at you for not considering stepping up at all for your own family.", "Yeah, but letting your family disappear into the foster system when you could have prevented it is way worse.  OP essentially told her sister that she doesn't give a fuck about her nieces and would allow them to suffer futher if the absolute worst happened.  Without even having to think about it, based on OP's  telling.  The chances of anything happening are slim and you have way more options for ensuring their care when you don't allow them to be whisked away into an overcrowded system rife with physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.\n\nEdit: To be frank, OP sounds like the last person who should be in charge of a young person's care.  But it's because she is incredibly cold-heartedly indifferent to their well-being.", "Children should be raised by those who love(not inappropriately) them and want them for the right reasons. Parents who don't want kids fuck up those kids heads.", "It\u2019s extremely entitled to basically demand that a specific person raise your kids if you die and to get upset when they have boundaries and say no. If you chose to have kids you are responsible for them and if the only place for them to go is foster care then you were irresponsible.", "Would you ask them to put their well being aside in favor of your own wellbeing? because what you're saying boils down to that.\n\nAsking 2 adults who got fucking sterilized, to take your kids is like asking a vegan if they want a burger or a steak. she knew the answer before she asked. \n\nNTA", "My aunt and uncle are also child free by choice and would have absolutely raised me if it came to it, not planning to have kids on your own is not the same as being unwilling to take in a family member if it came to it.", "Exactly this. My sister is child free, but I absolutely know I could rely on her to take on my kids if anything happened to me and their dad. Not that she's my first option, they'd go to my parents or their older sister who already has a kid and therefore knows what she's doing. I also know that even though I've already got a dog, if anything happened to my sister and her husband, we'd take on her cat, dog and 6 chickens!!!", "And it sounds like Op doesn\u2019t care much what happens to them. You could have said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t really the right people to raise children. Let\u2019s work on a plan as a family. We can help in X way. What are other options?\u201d", "That is my reasoning for believing OP is TA. I don't want to be childfree but I don't feel like raising, or even babysitting, anyone else's children, even if they were family. However, if my sibling died suddenly and had children, I'd take them.", "Well that is your choice, clearly OP is not you. Why are people forcing her to take responsibility when no one mentioned the father of the kids. Yeah he signed away his rights but he has far more responsibility compared to OP if their mom died.", "But it's different when it actually affects them!", "OP has the right to say no. Also OP stated she is not into the parenting lifestyle why on earth would we want kids in the care of someone that is not a kid person? It's a huge responsibility to put on someone who's already said they don't want it. I don't think this makes OP an asshole. Kids are no joke lol", "And you can make that choice, voluntarily. Suggesting someone else choosing otherwise is cold and a bad person is asshole territory."]}
