There is no reason why they need to be tracking you, turning up where you are and interupting dates like that.  Plus the bf acting like that, wow.

ALWAYS.\n\nIt really rubs me the wrong way that your BF got so upset about you trying to circumvent your parents' stalking. You've been dealing with it since you've had a phone and no doubt you have trouble trusting them as a result. Your BF is wrong about them just \"looking out for you,\" because they would have told you about Life360 if that were the case. What other reason would they have to keep it secret other than to spy on you?\n\nHe was out of line to tattle on you to your parents after finding your old phone.

I'm finding it hard to think of a reason how that kind of monitoring could be justified.  Is there some background that we're not aware of? \nDo you have a history of getting into trouble,  or was there an event that led to your family's paranoia about your welfare?

If it was anyone else it would be stalking but it's family so it's ok? Nah f that", "Nta. I understand your parents are worried but they've way overstepped boundaries. They aren't just monitoring you for safety. They are actively stalking you and using that fear you may be being watched at any moment to control you. This is your own personal 1984. Big Brother is always watching. Well, you are an adult now. You may be a bit constrained if you are funded by them.\n\nI definitely consider if you want to continue with your BF. He is empathising with their worry but happy to ensure you do not have any true freedom. He is likely to sabotage any attempts for you to get independence.", "NTA. I am on a life360 group. I just turn off location.", "NTA - you feed to dump your boyfriend.\n\nFirst off, it is NOT normal for parents to do this kind of tracking even though it's become normalized in our culture. You do not have to put up with it.\n\nSecond, the fact that your bf thinks what they are doing is okay means that he's been raised to think this kind of intrusion is okay. The fact that he not only got mad about it but told your parents? That's not cool.\n\nHe's not going to respect your boundaries, in the end. And may even expect that kind of tracking between the two of you as you get more serious. That's why I say part ways.\n\nHe violated your privacy in telling your parents.\n\nThird, your parents don't get to track your phone if you are paying for the service. They just don't. Set firm boundaries with them.", "NTA.  I can understand wanting to put one over on the parents after how they've been, and I think the SO was overreacting.  Recommend that you take the compromised phone and mail it to a friend who lives on the opposite side of the country.", "NTA\n\nIt might be a bit of a boundary cross to follow you around as a minor, but I feel like you left a lot of the story out on that, so I'm leaving that out of my ruling.\n\nBut.... if they're paying for your phone, they can still find you. Go get on your own phone plan.

I've never been in any serious trouble with my parents, and I didn't use to go out looking for trouble either. The worst thing I've done while out and about that I can remember is come home a bit after curfew. The only incident that comes to mind regarding my welfare is when my grandfather picked me up from a track event without telling my parents, so there was some panic there, but it was all resolved quickly and to my knowledge without any bad blood.

Second, you being afraid of the consequences of pulling away is a huge red flag for an abusive situation (also the stalking, the yelling, the manipulation, the controlling, basically all of it).

I knew my ex for 16 years and we were married for 13 before I left, so I get how hard it is.

If you tell him that you are going to cut ties with your family and ask him to stand by your side and not share any information about you with your family, what will he do? Can you trust him to not feed them information? Can you be completely sure that he'll tell you if he knows they're going to be somewhere so you can avoid them?
