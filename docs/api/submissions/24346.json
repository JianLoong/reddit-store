I've never asked him for a penny for her as I make better money than him and besides he has been unemployed due to medical reasons for the past four years after a bad injury. All I have ever asked of him is to visit and know our daughter but he struggles to even do that. She is lucky if she sees him even six times out of the year as he always flakes on arranged meetings or cancels at the last minute. We've fought about this so many times and at this stage I just don't have the energy for it.\n\nWhen she was three years old I began dating my husband (34M) though I waited till we'd been together a year before they even met as you can never be too safe and he was very understanding on this and I knew he was the one when on their third meeting she complained her shoes were pinching to me and he took us to get her new shoes and insisted on paying. We ended up marrying when she was six and our first dance was actually the three of us together. I'd learned over the course of our dating that he couldn't have children though he'd always wanted one and he leapt feet first into being the best male figure in my daughters life he could be. He has ensured he never missed anything to do with her even declining to go on a business trip as it would mean he'd miss her School play. He doesn't like my ex because of how often he has hurt her but he also never speaks ill of him in front of her.\n\nShe has begun to call my Husband Dad without either of us asking and at a meeting with my Ex she ended up calling him by his first name and when he tried to correct her she said that my Husband was her dad. I understood her feelings on this and refused to correct her. My Ex got angry and thought we had done this and turned her against him but I pointed out that he had done that himself and it was his fault she didn't view him as a Father and he has had plenty of chances. This led to an argument at which point I asked my husband to take her out to grab some food as I didn't want her hearing the impending shouting match.\n\nMy ex has had his family get on our case over this to try and get us to have my daughter use the \"proper respect\" towards her father. In my opinion she's old enough to know her own mind and i'm not going to invalidate her feelings to stroke the ego of a man who barely sees her.\n\nMy husband and I have discussed him adopting her in case anything ever happens to me and have even been in contact with a lawyer. I have years of texts proving my Ex rarely sees her and often cancels and also proof that he has never given monetary support. The lawyer feels that this is enough to help push the adoption through even if my ex refuses to consent which we suspect he will.\n\nI feel this could be an asshole behaviour as perhaps I should have been gentler over this and tried to make him see that he needs to put work in but it seems pointless tbh.", "created_utc": 1691685775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nhi0d/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_daughter_call_my_ex/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter has her own feelings and if she chooses to call your husband dad rather than her bio dad, this is her own right. There is a reason why she feels this connection with your husband and not your ex. \n\nI\u2019m in the same situation as you are, and trust me when I say you are doing the right thing by not forcing your daughter to call your ex dad. You are validating her feelings and giving her the space and respect to make her own decisions.", "NTA ... \n\nHe's not acting like \"dad\", he's acting like a sperm donor.", "NTA, your ex, was told why she doesn't view him as a dad - this was his chance to fix that.

I have three older siblings and their dad stepped up as my father. He did this out of pure kindness, he and my mom were never romantically involved after their divorce (several years before my birth). \n\nI was about 5 when I started calling him dad. No one prompted me to do it. Even at that young age I knew what a dad was and I knew who was performing dad duties and who wasn\u2019t. \n\nThe only people who had an issue with it were bio dad and his family. They believed (and still do) that it was some sort of scheme cooked up by my mom. Bio dad essentially abandoned me for a period of 7 years after this and I was able to be adopted by my \u2018dad\u2019 when I was 12. \n\nLooking back, choosing my dad was so fucking special and empowering.

Respect is earned, and baby-daddy is a flake.  He's never paid child support and he's never been active in her life.  NTA", "Respect and love are earned.

He now only seeks validation after he's spent years losing it.  Your new husband sounds like a jackpot, both for you and your daughter.  Get with that adoption ASAP and never think about this other guy again.", "NTA\n\nYour ex is lucky that your daughter is willing to have any kind of relationship with him at all, considering how little effort he puts into it. He's blaming you, because he refuses to accept responsibility for his own actions. Remind his that respect is earned, and he hasn't earned it.", "NTA, you\u2019re husband is so sweet, reminds me of my dad, same situation except bio didn\u2019t even try at all. You three are very lucky. Wishing you well in the adoption process! Ooo will she take his last name?", "NTA, at all.  Please move forward with the adoption to secure your daughter's future in the event something should happen to you.", "NTA- Dad is an earned title and your ex didn't earn it. Your daughter knows who her daddy really is.", "NTA\nTake him to court for child support and then you can negotiate your husband's adoption. Your ex can than publicly show the world what a great \"dad\" he is. He either steps up financially and sticks to a parenting plan or he gives her up for the real \"dad\".", "NTA. Your husband may not be her father, but he is definitely her daddy.\n\nMaybe she can call bio father \"bio father \"", "NTA. Ex has little to no relationship with your daughter. And makes no effort to be part of her life. Your husband is involved in her life.\n\nDoes ex's family even see her?", "NTA - being someone's \"dad\" is no longer about biology, it's the title for the person who does the job of showing up and being there for the kid. If your partner is doing that, he gets the title. If ex wants it, he should have put the work in and earned the title", "NTA and it takes more than a sperm to make you a father. Your daughter can have a cordial, distant relationship with her birth father and I hope her dad can adopt her without too much trouble.", "NTA! Congrats on finding an awesome partner! How dare his family criticize you and now him for abandoning his daughter.", "NTA. Choices and consequences should be the relationships equivalent of E=m.c^2...", "She is showing her father the proper respect. She calls him Dad.

Then he is not 'Dad' but sperm donor Joe.", "That will be her choice when the adoption process goes through, we want her to be able to pick what she wants.", "rarely, outside of things like her Birthday and Christmas etc they barely make an effort to see her.

I wouldn't listen to them or give them the time of day. You have to do what's best for you and yours.\n\nIf something happened to you, she doesn't know your ex well. It'd be very hard for her to be taken away from your husband and put with someone that she's unfamiliar with.\n\nPersonally, I think you're doing the right thing for her. I hope your ex doesn't put up too much of a fight", "You shouldn't have to make him see that he's being a bad parent.  It blatantly obvious.  Gentler?  Why would you treat him with kid gloves?  He doesn't deserve it.  He chose not to be in her life & had every opportunity to be a good dad & he flaked.  He doesn't deserve the title of dad & his own daughter feels it.  I think it's a great idea to have your husband adopt her.  This would make it impossible for him to have any rights to her.  You have done nothing wrong.  Your daughter chose her dad.  And it's not the man that shows up occasionally. It's the man who is a constant in her life, who will do anything for her.  Who will love her unconditionally.  That is what someone deserving of the title of dad does.", "op=nta\n\nbut does your daughter want to be adopted?\n\nI think there is good possibility, but i'd also work up trust/guardianship paperwork if you are turned down.  Bio-father will not be responsible.\n\nPlus if you have insurance/inheritance for daughter--make sure it's in a trust that can't be touched by Ex.", "NTA - no one with a slightly functioning brain needs to be told they actually have to talk to their daughter to be a dad", "NTA. What a shame deadbeat ex is such a dick. Your daughter sounds like a wonderful person and it's great that there is love and respect between her and stepdad. Block as many of family and friends of ex as you can. Whatever you do, make sure daughter does not become a pawn by ex.

Your daughter chose him as being a dad, and rejected her biological father. Amd all that without you pushing it? I think that speaks for itself. \n\nSounds like your husband was a good Catch.", "I'll never understand adults who demand respect from children but don't give them any.   You have to be respectable to get respect.", "Yeah John.  Oh wait.  I meant I agree with you.  I don't know anyone named John who treated his kids with no respect but constantly complained that they didn't respect him, their father."]}
