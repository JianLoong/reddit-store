Dislike of mornings aren't a factor.  Things need to get done. Period.  The fact that your unemployed partner wants YOU to find a different job so their sleep isn't interrupted by THE CHILD THE TWO OF YOU SHARE should really, really REALLY speak volumes to you.", "NTA. If she was working it would be a different story", "NTA.  Your partner wants you to get a different job so she doesn't have to wake up and parent?  Nope.", "NTA. So long as your partner is not working, they're on childcare duty during your working hours, whenever those may be. It shouldn't even be a question, this is some crazy next-level selfishness on her part.", "NTA. Apart from the work, you still have a kid that wakes early, so it's only fair that morning duties get shared too. Even without your current job, getting up early would be part of the deal. \n\nAlso, this is sorta temporary. Within a few years,your kid will wake up later. So changing a job you really like for a temporary problem seems like a bad idea.\n\nSolution is in communication. Is it just about the sleep schedule? Or more? I'm making a guess here: if she has to get up earlier so has to sleep earlier, and that can drastically cut into her child-free time that she uses to catch up with some cleaning and to just unwind. \n\nTry to find out if there's more behind it, and find ways to accomodate each other.", "NTA.  If your partner is the SAHP, they need to be parenting while you work, regardless of time or where you work.  You could try and see if you can get your daughter to sleep later (perhaps go to bed earlier) but some kids will be morning kids.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a morning person either and it can be very difficult to get myself out of bed early in the day so I get why your partner doesn\u2019t want to have to get up at 6:30 but its her child and you have to work so she needs to just suck it up and deal with it instead of expecting you to get a new job with different hours. She may not necessarily become a morning person and get used to the early hours but it will get easier for her to wake up that early as it becomes more of a habit. In the mean time she can drink caffeine and take a nap when you get off work but when you\u2019re at work she needs to be a parent to her child.", "NTA. You have WORK, even if it is at home. Plus, you're already taking care of your daughter for part of those early morning hours. Someone has to get the kid ready for school and it can't be you -- that's just a fact. It's also kinda nuts she's saying that you should get another job simply because of this. Especially when you're the breadwinner at the moment.\n\nAs a non-morning person myself, I sympathize with your wife. But (1) she's not tied up in a job, and (2) she's the only one free to take care of the kid at that time. \n\nShe's not being a good partner, and she needs to adult up.", "NTA.  Your partner is not working so she should be up taking care of your daughter while you are working.  It's that simple.", "INFO: Who does most of the childcare?", "INFO - Why does your daughter get up so early - 3 hours before preschool starts?  If your daughter got up at 7.30, would your partner be more willing to get up then?", "NTA, you're working and need to pay attention to it. Part of being a parent is taking care of your child, even if it means you can't sleep in.\n\nThat being said, is there a possible compromise that can be made where you have an self-directed activity for your daughter to do so that her attention is elsewhere but you can still supervise her? For example, can you get books from the library and have 6:30-7:30 be reading practice time and that way your daughter is occupied, you can do meetings, and your partner can sleep in until 7:30? (I don't have children so forgive me if this isn't an age appropriate example).", "NTA I also am not a morning person but you know what I do every day (except Sundays) wake up in the morning to watch my kid so my husband can WFH.", "I hate mornings but I have kids and they need to be cared for so I suck it up and take care of them. NTA", "Nta. Your spouse sounds terrible in this situation. Childcare is a joint effort. You're already fairly doing your part and you're only asking for help when it's time to work. You're also prepping lunch for your kid when it should be her responsibility since you're technically at work already and shes not even working.\n\nHer comment on asking you to find another job is unreasonable and extremely selfish. You're the only one contributing to your household finances at this time and asking you to change jobs risks your family's financial well being. \n\nNot sure why she's not working as you haven't stated but I would personally tell her to go get a job and start being a more responsible parent.", "NTA.This is about necessary cooperation. Under these circumstances, she has to realize her cooperation is required for everyone\u2019s best interest including her own.", "NTA and there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cnot a morning person\u201d when you have a child.", "NTA, your partner isn't working right now, the least she could do is pick up some extra parenting time. She can become an afternoon nap person instead.", "NAH. Your request is not unreasonable given your work schedule, but it also sounds like this schedule isn't going to work long-term for your family. You guys need to sit down and hash out what you both want and come up with a plan; if this becomes a daily battle, you're both going to become resentful.\n\nEd: Your partner is an AH for not stepping up and taking over the morning shift now, while this is your work schedule.

Unless you\u2019re running an estate, there shouldn\u2019t be a necessity of her staying home? \n\nRegardless, if she\u2019s the SAHP, child duty should be hers in the morning. You need to renegotiate the household duties so everyone is on the same page and content with that. \n\nAlso- sleeping in is a luxury that most parents of small children do not have.
