Especially after you tried the more diplomatic approach the first time. Animal control may or may not do much (really depends on the department/local laws/etc) but having an official record of them breaking through the fence could be invaluable down the road if it becomes a pattern or if god forbit something happens and you guys or your dog is injured because of it.", "NTA. If their dogs are in your yard and attacking you then maybe you should call the police to handle it.", "The dogs are now rummaging through our compost, eating pumpkins and green tomatoes. They deserve a better home.", "NTA\n\nI agree to that.", "agreed!!!!", "This is how we feel. It is now a reoccurring problem and needs to be documented through the proper channels in case they maul, me, my wife, or my service animal next time and I have to defend us. We have a doggie door, so he has the freedom to go potty in the night. I'm just glad she physically let him out this morning and noticed 10 minutes later, that they had busted through.", "I really don't want to fire a gun in city limits and deal with those consequences. I also don't want to be mauled by a pack of dogs and have to defend myself just to make a point. I can not say it hasn't crossed my mind, but my conscience couldn't handle it. \nThey're still roaming in the yard, and everytime I open the window to yell at them to get out of my garden, they do charge the door.", "NTA my gate broke and was propped open. A pit bill chased my cat from the front yard, into the backyard and up a 8 foot tall concrete brick wall which he climbed incredibly quickly.  Later I learned the dog was a sweetheart to people. Still she could have easily killed my cat! She just wanted to play chase the kitty. (My cat was not allowed in the front yard, he snuck out. After the pit bull incident he stayed in the backyard. I have since moved and my current cat goes out in a harness.)\n\nThose dogs could have attacked your dogs and if your dogs are small dogs, they could easily kill them in seconds. Plus if it gets those poor dogs out of an abusive home it is a bonus!!!", "I don\u2019t know", "NTA. My mom's dog got attacked by a neighbor's dog after it burst into my family's backyard via a hole, and prior to that *her* mom had a dog killed and another severely wounded when a neighbor's dog broke through the fence (and to make matters worse, my mom's dog used to belong to my grandma; thankfully he's alright now). If the dogs are constantly snarling at people or animals on the other side of the fence (and there's a *noticeable* difference between barking and actual snarling), that's a sign they really want to get at whatever's on that side of the fence; them breaking into the yard has to be taken seriously.\n\nThis is the sort of thing animal control exists for.", "You seem to have your head and heart in the right place, which is good. From your comments it seems like the dogs are malnourished and dehydrated, and dogs tend to get violent when desperate. Be SUPER careful if the dogs break out and go through your garbage/compost because they might start resource guarding out of desperation. You might want to start locking that stuff away if you can. Good luck to you."]}
