In the beginning him stopping by to check once is understandable.  But months into your lease now and you're getting all sorts of mail from him and he keeps showing up.  Now it's just shady. It's normal to get some mail for a previous resident but that much.  It seems like he's still using address for receiving mail and packages for some reason.  There are several reasons why might do this, but it doesn't matter, it needs to stop.  He's had plenty of time to do a mail forwarding with the post office.  Let this guy know that you will no longer be giving him any mail delivered to your apartment and everything that you receive in his name will be sent back to the post office.  Also let the local post office know that this guy no longer lives at your address.  You'll probably still get stuff with his name on it but it might lessen.", "He is a weirdo.

He moved in with a romantic partner and is hiding some stuff by having it sent to his old place. B. He\u2019s living out of his car and still wants an address for things to be mailed to. C.

Also take pictures of the mail before returning it and email yourself the pictures so you have proof of the timeline. Also write the name down, his license plate number, make and model of the car, and send yourself an email every time he stops by for a record.
