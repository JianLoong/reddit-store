He said he would. He didn\u2019t come by for about a month but I was still receiving alot of mail with his name on it. I would just write \u201cRecipient Not At This Address\u201d and drop it back off at the post office. A little over a month passed, and he started showing up at my door again. I told him I didn\u2019t have his mail and I dropped it back off at the post office.  He gave me his number on a post it and told me to text him when his mail comes.  I didn\u2019t say anything and just went back into the house.  He showed up maybe 7-8 more times in the following months but I just didn\u2019t answer the door.
