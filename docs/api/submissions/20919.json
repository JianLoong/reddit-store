The first week I moved in, the previous tenant came knocking on my door to see if his mail came. He said he was waiting on an important document. I walked up to the mailbox with him, since I hadn\u2019t got anything with his name on it yet. There was an envelope that matched his ID. I gave it to him and he left.  He showed up 3 other times in the next two weeks knocking on my door. I would just hand him the stuff and he\u2019d leave.  On the third time I told him that he needs to change his mail address. He said he would. He didn\u2019t come by for about a month but I was still receiving alot of mail with his name on it. I would just write \u201cRecipient Not At This Address\u201d and drop it back off at the post office. A little over a month passed, and he started showing up at my door again. I told him I didn\u2019t have his mail and I dropped it back off at the post office.  He gave me his number on a post it and told me to text him when his mail comes.  I didn\u2019t say anything and just went back into the house.  He showed up maybe 7-8 more times in the following months but I just didn\u2019t answer the door.  I continued to write \u201cRecipient Not At This Address\u201d and dropped the mail back off at the post office.\nLast week, I was coming back from a walk with my dog and he was sitting, parked up ON the curb leading to the walkway to my door and he gets out of his car and says \u201cHey! I think a package came for me yesterday\u201d he followed me up to my door.  I told him to please give me some space before I open the door. He stepped back and I opened the door and handed him his package as I hadn\u2019t made it the post office yet to drop it off.  I told him he really needs to get his address changed and to please stop coming back here. \nThis morning when I was coming back from walk, he comes pulling up again right when I got to the curb and was asking if I\u2019ve gotten anything else.  I hadn\u2019t.  So I told him no. \nI\u2019m a woman who lives by myself and works from home. I just feel uneasy knowing this guy basically knows my schedule now.

Do you have physical proof of that?\n\nI would be very cautious of this - my initial thought is that your residence may be being used as a shipping location for illegal substances. Not hard to get a bunch of mail with a name forwarded to an address.\n\nI would certainly tell the landlord. I may also escalate that to local PD.", "NTA. Sounds like the previous tenant is actually homeless and continues to use his previous address (your current address) to cover it up.\n\nYou can report him to the Post Master at your local post office for postal dumping.

He's either pathologically lazy or \"up to no good\".\n\nIt may be possible for the post office to redirect mail with his name on it to his postal address if you ask them. \n\nAt present he's using your mailbox as a secure post box for free. Start charging him \u00a310 per package. Alternatively report him to the police for harrassment because he is harrassing you. Whether they charge him or not, it'll lead to him explaining to them why he has not changed his postal address for mail order items in 5 months.", "This may not be harmless.

Changing your address with the USPS system cost $1. The next time you see him at your location, turn around, and go to the apartment complex office immediately. Also, call 911.

He has probably involved you in illegal activities, because he knows you won't speak up.\nDon't ever again let some stranger use you like this. How far away is he traveling to pick up the mysterious packages? I bet you didn't even ask. Now he knows what time you get home, when you are out, etc.\nEither the packages address illegal, or he is stalking you, and working up the courage to commit a crime upon your person.\nGet a cam for the front door, and start reporting him for stalking.  If he's harmless, he'll go away.  Either way, he won't stop until you change your behavior. Good luck, and please, be stronger for your own safety.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
