{"id": 4981, "submission_id": "zodnn6", "title": "AITA for only getting my daughter when it is \u201cconvenient for me\u201d?", "selftext": "Throwaway. \n\nI (33F) have a daughter who is 13. My ex has had primary custody of her since she was 2. I won\u2019t get into it but I was in a bad place after we split up and he swooped in and got custody. \n\nMy daughter Emma lives with him but I get 1, 3 and 5 weekends (6 pm Friday to 6 pm Sunday) plus two Thursdays a month from 6-8 pm. We alternate holidays and I get her for 45 days straight in the summer. \n\nHe\u2019s moved once and I\u2019ve gradually moved farther and farther.  We now live close to 2 hours apart. I\u2019ve remarried and have 3 little kids, two daughters and one son. It\u2019s really inconvenient for me to drive through Friday night traffic for a 4 hour round trip to get Emma three times a month. My husband does it on occasion but it\u2019s usually me and I have to wait until he gets home to watch our three kids so I can get Emma. He said Emma is my child and so getting her is my responsibility. \n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t get her too often. There have been years where, aside from summer when I ALWAYS get her and my holidays when I always get her, I have only gotten Emma for maybe 10 weekends in the year. \nThis year, I tried to get her at least once a month although it usually ended up being once every 5/6 weeks. I\u2019m just so busy with my little children. \n\nEmma told me at Thanksgiving she only wants to come for 2 weeks in the summer, because it\u2019s her time to relax and have fun without school. I told her absolutely not and it\u2019s important to spend time together. That time is legally mine. She\u2019s 13 and doesn\u2019t get to decide what she gets to do. She said I don\u2019t even bother to get her every 1, 3 and 5th weekend and it seems like I only get her in the summer because it\u2019s convenient for me and less driving. \n\nI often cry when we talk about this because I feel like she was stolen from me, but she told me that she feels like I\u2019m manipulating her by crying and that I cry so she will give me my way. That if I really wanted her, I would make every effort I could to get her. She said it makes her feel like my other kids are more important but I don\u2019t see it that way. My kids live with me so of course they're forefront on my brain. I told her she was being ridiculous. \n\nI was going to get her yesterday but she has a head cold and I don't want to expose my kids. She is not responding to my texts so I think her feelings are hurt. \n\nSo AITA? What should I do?\n\nEDIT: Okay. I have read through every comment and I appreciate the input, although it hurt to read. \n\nI am going to see if I can sit down and talk to Emma and her father. I talked to my husband and I am going to get her at least two of my three weekends in 2023. And I will dial back summer visitation. I need to respect where she is coming from. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend 45 days straight with someone who doesn\u2019t care about me, so why should she. \n\nI\u2019m not going to make any excuses. When I read the things I wrote and put myself in Emma\u2019s shoes, I can see why she should hate me. No excuses.. I\u2019ve made my other children a priority and have not made Emma a priority. \nI\u2019ve been resentful of Emma\u2019s relationship with her stepmom for years but now I see that I\u2019ve basically pushed Emma into her arms. \n\nDefinitely feeling IATA but if the shoe fits..", "created_utc": 1671304436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zodnn6/aita_for_only_getting_my_daughter_when_it_is/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s extremely detrimental for kids to have a parent that comes in and out of their life. Kids need stability. You made the choice to move farther away and with that means you will have to travel more for visitation. If your current visitation isn\u2019t working then work with your ex to come up with one where you can be more consistent. It sounds like your oldest is more of an afterthought and I wouldn\u2019t blame them for feeling like you see her siblings as more important bc your actions have made it clear that that is just a fact.\n\nIn regards to the summer thing, stop treating her like she isn\u2019t her own person with the whole that time is legally mine. The visitation is for both of you and not just for you. You invalidate her thoughts and feelings by doing that.\n\nAnd lastly there\u2019s irony in you being pissed that she wants to spend less time with you in the summer.

You also seem to not want being a parent to require any actual work, but being a parent is a lot of work. When you were getting into other relationships, looking at housing options, or whatever else went into your choices in moving further from your child, a plan for ensuring you're able to keep up with your custody agreement should have been at the forefront of your thought process.\n\n>I have to wait until he gets home to watch our three kids so I can get Emma. He said Emma is my child and so getting her is my responsibility.\n\nIs there a problem with watching your children for approx. 4 hours? Why do you keep having kids if you have an issue with babysitting for as little as 4 hours while your husband does you a favour. He's right, you should be taking on a fair amount of the responsibility in seeing your own child.\n\n>Admittedly, I don\u2019t get her too often.\n\nYou don't WANT her too often, you said it yourself, you don't like making the drive to get your daughter as often as you agreed to have your daughter.\n\n>Emma told me at Thanksgiving she only wants to come for 2 weeks in the summer, because it\u2019s her time to relax and have fun without school. I told her absolutely not and it\u2019s important to spend time together. That time is legally mine.\n\nSo that time is not yours it's your daughter's, and if you don't want her to hate you, then you should probably respect her wishes. I would also add, that if your ex went to the courts and explained how little effort you put into actually meeting your custody agreement, you would likely lose any legal entitlement to that time. Finally, at 13 years old, your daughter absolutely has a say in custody arrangements, a court is not going to force a teenager to visit a parent.\n\n>I feel like she was stolen from me\n\nBy your own admission, you were a bad parent early in your daughter's life. Her dad stepped up and has been her primary source of support since. Nothing was stolen from you and you've put little effort (like driving 2 hours) to recover what you have lost.\n\n>she feels like I\u2019m manipulating her by crying and that I cry so she will give me my way. That if I really wanted her, I would make every effort I could to get her.\n\nShe is correct.", "YTA. Your not making the effort when it\u2019s not easy for you, but when it is demanding it.\n\n13 is absolutely old enough to decide where she wants to spend her time, and her not wanting to spend the entire summer with you and away from her friends is perfectly natural and expected at her age. \n\nShe is telling you that your making her feel like you don\u2019t give a shit and you basically confirmed that we\u2019ll your other kids are in the forefront, but then wonder why she wants to spend less time with you.", "You\u2019ve been absent, neglectful and emotionally manipulative, of course she doesn\u2019t want to spend much time with you.\n\n> She\u2019s 13 and doesn\u2019t get to decide what to do\n\nYeah she does, she\u2019s old enough that any judge would listen to her and take her opinion into account in family court, so if you keep pushing you risk losing contact all together.\n\nBe grateful she wants to spend any time with you at all.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nLet's break this down. \n\nYou lost custody (which we all know is next to impossible for the mother) , nobody stole anyone \n\nYou moved 2 hours away\n\nYou don't pick her up every weekend that you're supposed to .\n\nYou started a replacement family \n\nYou put on the fake water works when someone calls you out.\n\nUnbelievable you don't see how terrible a mother you are", "YTA. Maybe she wants to be at her father's place for summer because that's where her friends are. I can't imagine she has too many (if any) friends at your house if she's only there for 3 days every 2 months.", "YTA.  She is an inconvenience to you.  In my home state, at 13, she is allowed to request a court date and tell the court that she does not want to see you ever again - even if you pay child support.  Your husband sounds like he's not supportive of your situation with her, and you're unmotivated to negotiate for different terms (long weekend holidays from school, school vacations, etc.), which you should have done if you really want to see her.  Yes, you have other kids, but you are neglecting your firstborn.  You are manipulating the situation by crying to her when she tries to be honest with you - even if you don't see it that way.  Stop being self-centered.  You see her as a burden.  You want her in your life because of what she represents - a thing that was \"stolen\" from you - not as a living, feeling human being.  Clearly, she sees her time with you as draining (hence the wish to only spend two weeks at your place in the summer, so that she actually gets a vacation), but you're more interested in having the time \"owed\" to you, not in spending quality time with your oldest; and that's probably because you're so busy with your other children.  Either be a parent and work this out, or tell her that you're sorry that you made her feel this way, that you love her and will be eagerly waiting to have her visit again whenever she is ready,  and then let her go.  What you're doing now is just wrong.  You moved on, and she's become inconvenient.  You made your point marvelously.

You said you changed and have your life on track but yet you still aren't making an effort to see your child. Did your ex really swoop in and rob you or did he step up to take care of the kid when you couldn't? Are you really mad at your ex or at the fact you lost custody of your child because of your own actions and now you have to live with the consequences? If you are in a much better place then when you guys broke up you could go back to court for a different custody agreement but the fact you haven't been sticking to the current isn't going to look good.

If one of your 3 kids that live with you get sick, do you ship them out of the house until they get better so the other two don't get sick? I am betting not.

My ex has had primary custody of her since she was 2. I won\u2019t get into it but I was in a bad place after we split up and he swooped in and got custody. \n\nMy daughter Emma lives with him but I get 1, 3 and 5 weekends (6 pm Friday to 6 pm Sunday) plus two Thursdays a month from 6-8 pm. We alternate holidays and I get her for 45 days straight in the summer. \n\nHe\u2019s moved once and I\u2019ve gradually moved farther and farther.  We now live close to 2 hours apart. I\u2019ve remarried and have 3 little kids, two daughters and one son. It\u2019s really inconvenient for me to drive through Friday night traffic for a 4 hour round trip to get Emma three times a month. My husband does it on occasion but it\u2019s usually me and I have to wait until he gets home to watch our three kids so I can get Emma. He said Emma is my child and so getting her is my responsibility. \n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t get her too often. There have been years where, aside from summer when I ALWAYS get her and my holidays when I always get her, I have only gotten Emma for maybe 10 weekends in the year. \nThis year, I tried to get her at least once a month although it usually ended up being once every 5/6 weeks. I\u2019m just so busy with my little children. \n\nEmma told me at Thanksgiving she only wants to come for 2 weeks in the summer, because it\u2019s her time to relax and have fun without school. I told her absolutely not and it\u2019s important to spend time together. That time is legally mine. She\u2019s 13 and doesn\u2019t get to decide what she gets to do. She said I don\u2019t even bother to get her every 1, 3 and 5th weekend and it seems like I only get her in the summer because it\u2019s convenient for me and less driving. \n\nI often cry when we talk about this because I feel like she was stolen from me, but she told me that she feels like I\u2019m manipulating her by crying and that I cry so she will give me my way. That if I really wanted her, I would make every effort I could to get her. She said it makes her feel like my other kids are more important but I don\u2019t see it that way. My kids live with me so of course they're forefront on my brain. I told her she was being ridiculous. \n\nI was going to get her yesterday but she has a head cold and I don't want to expose my kids. She is not responding to my texts so I think her feelings are hurt. \n\nSo AITA? What should I do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At the time I'd allowed my oldest daughter to live with her biological father/my ex husband for a year or two because of the excellent school district he lived in (she was in elementary at the time, she's 21 now \u2764\ufe0f). My husband and I lived about 2.5 hours away from them then and I also had a full job job with 2 more children at home under the 3. I picked her up every other weekend, sometimes more weekends because I wanted her to spend a lot of time with her little brother and sister (her bio dad agreed to this). As far as pick ups, think Friday after school to Sunday evening. These trips to pick her up/drop her off were brutal in relation to traffic, but we always used that time to laugh, play, listen to music and just have a good time in the car while they were awake. I also got copious holidays and summers with her. I took a shift that gave me Fridays off so this would be easier, and  my husband always took her back on Sundays either with me or for me so I could stay home and rest with the little ones. Sure, this only lasted a year or two because we ended up moving those 2.5 hours to her school district and then she came back home to live with us full time, but it wasn't easy. But who cares if it's hard? It's called parenting and our children deserve all we have to give (I was also a breastfeeding mom and sometimes had to pull off the expressway to nurse) It's on you to find a way to do what you need to do for ALL your children; we choose to be their parents, they don't choose to be our children. A few bullet points: 1. You crying to her is deplorable, and I agree with her that it's manipulative (She's a smart kid). Grow up and stop this! 2. You may have chosen the wrong man to build a family with. My husband is my oldest daughter's FATHER (we all consider him her #1 father because he's always been there. He and all my in laws consider my oldest to be his first born and you'd NEVER know she wasn't his blood unless we told you. He'd do anything for her. Your husband saying she's your daughter to shuttle around is a huge red flag. My husband knew it was a package deal when we me. He was going to love her like his blood or he was going to choose another wife. You should've taken this stand years ago. 3. She is a teenager now and will begin to partake in teenage activities. Making her miss these to be with you, with all the issues you guys have before you, is going to make a difficult situation worse. You guys need therapy. Individual and family.

You do not deserve to have children. 13 is the legal age in most states in the US for the child to have a say in who they live with. I'm in texas and my ex is in Massachusetts and we still make it work with visits and phone calls...etc. we do what we need to do to be there for our son no matter what. I hope that she convinces her dad to take you back to court to terminate your visitation so then you don't have to be inconvenienced by your flesh and blood.", "Wow lady. YTA so much and the fact that you have to ask or try to reason with control is frightening? \u201cIt\u2019s my legal right to have you for 45 days straight even though it is also my legal right to see you on the other court-appointed days\u201d. Yeah? And? She\u2019s 13. Plenty old enough to see that you gave up consistency for your three \u201clittle children\u201d. Ouch. Let her make this decision and truly, let her go. Exercising your legal rights over her is just possessive and that\u2019s such a gross thing to teach your daughter. You chose to be at a distance from her full time life. Selfish, stupid, AND an asshole. What a whammy.", "YTA - 'Emma has a cold and I don't want to expose my kids' - so there are  'your kids' and 'Emma'?\n\nYou didn't want to take care of Emma when she was ill, your first thought was your new family.\n\nNobody can blame Emma for recognising that you'll reach for any excuse to not make the trip.  She knows she isn't your fav child because you would have no problem driving 2 hours each way then.  You were the person who moved further and further away from where she lives.\n\nShe's now a teenager and its a lot harder to force a teenager than a smaller child who seeks parental approval and affection.  Emma has surrendered on that and its a very sad moment for her.", "YTA. You literally just said that you care more about your other kids because they live with you. If you wanted to spend more time with her, you would.", "YTA\n\n>She said I don\u2019t even bother to get her every 1, 3 and 5th weekend and it seems like I only get her in the summer because it\u2019s convenient for me and less driving.\n\nSo, um, literally the reason *you* gave?\n\nLook, you need to actually hear what your daughter is saying and consider what she's hearing when she listens to you.  She outright told you that she didn't want to stay with you over the summer (fun fact: 13 year-olds have friends).  You responded that it was \"your\" time.\n\n>I told her she was being ridiculous.\n\nYeah, that'll help.  Ignore your daughter, tell her to her face that what you want is more important than what she wants, turn on the waterworks to manipulate her then call her ridiculous when she calls you out.\n\nForce contact now, you'll get no contact once Emma can decide.  You can't just flake on her regular visits then get all butthurt when she doesn't look forward to spending weeks on end with you.\n\nCould you maybe give us a ballpark figure of just how much unpaid babysitting you're going to be expecting out of her over the summer?  Does she have her own room when she stays with you?  How much contact is she going to have with her friends?", "Hey OP, does your ex wife know you're posting for her?", "YTA. You abandoned her as a child and when you got your life on track continued to abandon and fail her. If you actually do love her, prove it. I really hope you do the right thing and do good by her.", "YTA. She tells you what she wants and instead of acknowledging it you treat her like she\u2019s property.", "My parents divorced too, and I rarely saw my Dad (every other week end and half of the holidays), but it was always regular, and I knew I could rely on him. He never pursued any extra time, nor was he ever really invested in my and my sister's life, but he always did the minimum. The bar is low, but the expectations were always clearly met.\nOP just randomly flaking on her alloted time is the absolute worst.", "She is of an age where she probably enjoys hanging out with friends and feels isolated at your house with 3 little kids. How do you plan to keep her occupied this summer?  You talk about being so busy with your little children that you cannot even pick up your older daughter.  Are you going to be too busy with them this summer that you can\u2019t do more grown up activities with Emma?  If she complains that she is bored and wants to go home because you pay no attention to her are you going to cry and claim she is manipulating you?  I feel sorry for her.", "If she's in the US she's already old enough to request the agreement be changed in many states.", "Agree with this. My dad had custody of me and my mom moved further and further away with her husband making it difficult to see her. I pretty much have zero contact with her now.", "Also, the dad moved once. She was the one moving farther away. Noone took anything from her, it's the other way around.", "And she wasn\u2019t STOLEN from OP. Op went off the rails. The ex did what he had to for the safety of the child. \n\nOP lost her daughter because of OP\u2019s mess.", "Why should the father have to drive halfway when OP is the one who chose to move so far away? Why inconvenience him over her choices?", "I do understand why she doesn't want to bundle three young children in a car for 4 hours every other week, that is not the walk in the park you're making it out to be lol, but it's not an excuse to abandon her daughter especially when she's the one who chose to move farther and farther away.", "OP is YTA but this description of little kids on a 1-2hr car ride seems unrealistic. Idk how old these kids are but if they\u2019re little then snack get thrown/dropped, devices get dropped, kids get unreasonably irritated at things on screen (or in general), kids fight, etc\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not coming at you or anything, your description just irked me because of the amount of times I\u2019ve been in cars with kids. I\u2019m simply basing this on my own experiences. Maybe she could just take the oldest one or two. Leave the youngest with dad or another responsible caretaker.", "She could\u2019ve asked for more time once she had resolved whatever happened before but she never did and chose to make it even more difficult to herself by moving.", "Exactly my first thought, free babysitter.\n\nHow can op demand the kid stays all summer because its legally her time yet cannot collect the child like clockwork on every other day of her legal time.\nSorry op, if you can't stick to the timetable of what's legally your time then you don't deserve that time, moreover, you have no leg to stand on making demands to a child who is old enough to know her own mind and see the situation as it is.\n\nGet your shit together before she decides she is done being second best in your life. Having little kids is not an excuse, if you can mother them then you can be a mother to your eldest with equal priority.", "BINGO!", "This! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "Usually that age is 16, so not quite old enough yet. \n\nBut she is old enough that if OP tries to force the issue by taking it to court, the judge will take her input into account.", "Her husband is not an AH. My guess is he's tired of her BS anyway and she's made it clear the kid isn't a priority so why is it on him to make her one?", "I don\u2019t really get why the husband is an AH when she\u2019s been pushing off her responsibility to drive the 4h and pick up the child for custody to him? She doesn\u2019t even want to do or hasn\u2019t been doing the drive herself this year considering her child has been noticing her lack of attention and effort during her allocated times", "Husband is not an AH for not letting her force a task that she considers unpleasant/not worth doing if she has to do it herself on him. \n\nIt would be different if she had some sort of obligation preventing her from picking up her daughter, but the only reason why she wants him to do it is because she doesn\u2019t want to, and thinks doing it sucks. That\u2019s the argument of a self-centered AH.", "Sounds like \"whatever happened\" was her being a neglectful parent because she's entirely wrapped up in her own feelings and wants, so unfortunately that clearly has not been resolved.", "At the time I needed that info for myself I was 14 and the state I lived in had the age at 13. The book I had at the time showed a table with the ages and many were listed as 13. It was one of the idiots guides (I believe it was called 'For Children of Divorce' or similar). That was back in '04 so perhaps ages have been changed in many places.", "If that is the case then yes, he\u2019s not. I am solely basing it on her side of the story of him saying she\u2019s your \u201cchild, so she\u2019s your responsibility to get her\u201d. If she\u2019s struggling and he\u2019s not supportive by helping then he\u2019s an AH.", "It\u2019s AITA. It\u2019s hard for people not to come up with a reason that a man isn\u2019t somehow the AH.", "My ETA: \no clarify my husband is a huge AH statement is, basing only on her post, that if she is struggling to take care of her little ones and get to her daughter and he is unsupportive. Again, she stated he said,, she\u2019s \u201cyour child, so getting her is your responsibility\u201d. So, based on this it seems he\u2019s not very supportive of her seeing her daughter. If it\u2019s more that she\u2019s not trying and pushing it on him then I get his reasoning.", "That\u2019s what I am saying if she had to put her act together she could\u2019ve said I am better, I am doing better , prove it, get more time, but it was not really what she wanted or was willing to work for and now she is surprised that putting no effort is having the consequence of her daughter not wanting to spend time with her.", "You know, as a kid I used to get mad because my dad favored my stepbrother over me (and he did to some extent, although looking back with adult experience I 100% believe he did not mean to) but even when getting me was a five hour round trip, he was there every weekend I wanted to visit and he never once complained about the drive. \n\nBecause he loved me and wanted as much time with me as he could possibly have. \n\nGod damn I miss him.", ">The ex could play the \"you're supposed to have Emma these weekends, pick her up or I'll take you back to court\" card, it's her legal obligation to do so. But that hasn't been mentioned. He totally could though, it's his legal right to hold her to the agreement.\n\nThis isn't true. Courts don't make parents see their kids. If the parents doesn't want to see their kid, there is nothing the court will do. It's only if one parent withholds access to the child and prevents visitation is there a problem.", "Literally everything she says is BS for a mom so I wouldn't even entertain the idea of helping her. My guess is it's one of those you do it I'm not in the mood for it. She acts like the oldest daughter is a chore. She needs to sign over her rights and leave this child be.", "But the thing is she said she gets her 13yo after her husband gets home to take care of the little ones. And that \u201cit\u2019s really inconvenient to drive through Friday night traffic to get her three times a month\u201d. If her husband watches the children when she usually picks up her 13yo the other times, then he\u2019s been helping her but that she admittedly doesn\u2019t get her often because she isn\u2019t making the drive. Like I don\u2019t get how he\u2019s wrong when when he says it\u2019s her responsibility to pick up her child when it is her responsibility. Just listen to the excuses she\u2019s making for not picking up her child. The drive is too long. The child is sick. Etc. When Emma is getting picked up, who do you think she wants to see make that effort for her, instead of prioritizing her new family as she witnesses now", "the law can change, based on where you live. Some kids are forced, some kids aren't forced..."]}
