My ex has had primary custody of her since she was 2. I won\u2019t get into it but I was in a bad place after we split up and he swooped in and got custody. \n\nMy daughter Emma lives with him but I get 1, 3 and 5 weekends (6 pm Friday to 6 pm Sunday) plus two Thursdays a month from 6-8 pm. We alternate holidays and I get her for 45 days straight in the summer. \n\nHe\u2019s moved once and I\u2019ve gradually moved farther and farther.  We now live close to 2 hours apart. I\u2019ve remarried and have 3 little kids, two daughters and one son. It\u2019s really inconvenient for me to drive through Friday night traffic for a 4 hour round trip to get Emma three times a month. My husband does it on occasion but it\u2019s usually me and I have to wait until he gets home to watch our three kids so I can get Emma. He said Emma is my child and so getting her is my responsibility. \n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t get her too often. There have been years where, aside from summer when I ALWAYS get her and my holidays when I always get her, I have only gotten Emma for maybe 10 weekends in the year. \nThis year, I tried to get her at least once a month although it usually ended up being once every 5/6 weeks. I\u2019m just so busy with my little children. \n\nEmma told me at Thanksgiving she only wants to come for 2 weeks in the summer, because it\u2019s her time to relax and have fun without school. I told her absolutely not and it\u2019s important to spend time together. That time is legally mine. She\u2019s 13 and doesn\u2019t get to decide what she gets to do. She said I don\u2019t even bother to get her every 1, 3 and 5th weekend and it seems like I only get her in the summer because it\u2019s convenient for me and less driving. \n\nI often cry when we talk about this because I feel like she was stolen from me, but she told me that she feels like I\u2019m manipulating her by crying and that I cry so she will give me my way. That if I really wanted her, I would make every effort I could to get her. She said it makes her feel like my other kids are more important but I don\u2019t see it that way. My kids live with me so of course they're forefront on my brain. I told her she was being ridiculous. \n\nI was going to get her yesterday but she has a head cold and I don't want to expose my kids. She is not responding to my texts so I think her feelings are hurt. \n\nSo AITA?

It\u2019s extremely detrimental for kids to have a parent that comes in and out of their life. Kids need stability. You made the choice to move farther away and with that means you will have to travel more for visitation. If your current visitation isn\u2019t working then work with your ex to come up with one where you can be more consistent. It sounds like your oldest is more of an afterthought and I wouldn\u2019t blame them for feeling like you see her siblings as more important bc your actions have made it clear that that is just a fact.\n\nIn regards to the summer thing, stop treating her like she isn\u2019t her own person with the whole that time is legally mine. The visitation is for both of you and not just for you. You invalidate her thoughts and feelings by doing that.\n\nAnd lastly there\u2019s irony in you being pissed that she wants to spend less time with you in the summer.

It\u2019s really inconvenient for me to drive through Friday night traffic for a 4 hour round trip to get Emma three times a month\n\nYou want to retain what custody you have, but didn't factor in living close to the more responsible parent for at least two home moves, maybe more. You also seem to not want being a parent to require any actual work, but being a parent is a lot of work. When you were getting into other relationships, looking at housing options, or whatever else went into your choices in moving further from your child, a plan for ensuring you're able to keep up with your custody agreement should have been at the forefront of your thought process.\n\n>I have to wait until he gets home to watch our three kids so I can get Emma. He said Emma is my child and so getting her is my responsibility.\n\nIs there a problem with watching your children for approx. 4 hours? Why do you keep having kids if you have an issue with babysitting for as little as 4 hours while your husband does you a favour. He's right, you should be taking on a fair amount of the responsibility in seeing your own child.\n\n>Admittedly, I don\u2019t get her too often.\n\nYou don't WANT her too often, you said it yourself, you don't like making the drive to get your daughter as often as you agreed to have your daughter.\n\n>Emma told me at Thanksgiving she only wants to come for 2 weeks in the summer, because it\u2019s her time to relax and have fun without school. I told her absolutely not and it\u2019s important to spend time together. That time is legally mine.\n\nSo that time is not yours it's your daughter's, and if you don't want her to hate you, then you should probably respect her wishes. I would also add, that if your ex went to the courts and explained how little effort you put into actually meeting your custody agreement, you would likely lose any legal entitlement to that time. Finally, at 13 years old, your daughter absolutely has a say in custody arrangements, a court is not going to force a teenager to visit a parent.\n\n>I feel like she was stolen from me\n\nBy your own admission, you were a bad parent early in your daughter's life. Her dad stepped up and has been her primary source of support since. Nothing was stolen from you and you've put little effort (like driving 2 hours) to recover what you have lost.\n\n>she feels like I\u2019m manipulating her by crying and that I cry so she will give me my way. That if I really wanted her, I would make every effort I could to get her.\n\nShe is correct.", "YTA. Your not making the effort when it\u2019s not easy for you, but when it is demanding it.\n\n13 is absolutely old enough to decide where she wants to spend her time, and her not wanting to spend the entire summer with you and away from her friends is perfectly natural and expected at her age. \n\nShe is telling you that your making her feel like you don\u2019t give a shit and you basically confirmed that we\u2019ll your other kids are in the forefront, but then wonder why she wants to spend less time with you.", "You\u2019ve been absent, neglectful and emotionally manipulative, of course she doesn\u2019t want to spend much time with you.\n\n> She\u2019s 13 and doesn\u2019t get to decide what to do\n\nYeah she does, she\u2019s old enough that any judge would listen to her and take her opinion into account in family court, so if you keep pushing you risk losing contact all together.\n\nBe grateful she wants to spend any time with you at all.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nLet's break this down. \n\nYou lost custody (which we all know is next to impossible for the mother) , nobody stole anyone \n\nYou moved 2 hours away\n\nYou don't pick her up every weekend that you're supposed to .\n\nYou started a replacement family \n\nYou put on the fake water works when someone calls you out.\n\nUnbelievable you don't see how terrible a mother you are", "YTA. Maybe she wants to be at her father's place for summer because that's where her friends are. I can't imagine she has too many (if any) friends at your house if she's only there for 3 days every 2 months.", "YTA.  She is an inconvenience to you.  In my home state, at 13, she is allowed to request a court date and tell the court that she does not want to see you ever again - even if you pay child support.  Your husband sounds like he's not supportive of your situation with her, and you're unmotivated to negotiate for different terms (long weekend holidays from school, school vacations, etc.), which you should have done if you really want to see her.  Yes, you have other kids, but you are neglecting your firstborn.  You are manipulating the situation by crying to her when she tries to be honest with you - even if you don't see it that way.  Stop being self-centered.  You see her as a burden.  You want her in your life because of what she represents - a thing that was \"stolen\" from you - not as a living, feeling human being.  Clearly, she sees her time with you as draining (hence the wish to only spend two weeks at your place in the summer, so that she actually gets a vacation), but you're more interested in having the time \"owed\" to you, not in spending quality time with your oldest; and that's probably because you're so busy with your other children.  Either be a parent and work this out, or tell her that you're sorry that you made her feel this way, that you love her and will be eagerly waiting to have her visit again whenever she is ready,  and then let her go.  What you're doing now is just wrong.  You moved on, and she's become inconvenient.  You made your point marvelously.  Now let your daughter go live her life.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve made and shown her that your \u201clittle children\u201d are top priority and she is a labor.

She can clearly see that her, your first born child, is not a priority to you as her younger siblings.

You said you changed and have your life on track but yet you still aren't making an effort to see your child. Did your ex really swoop in and rob you or did he step up to take care of the kid when you couldn't? Are you really mad at your ex or at the fact you lost custody of your child because of your own actions and now you have to live with the consequences? If you are in a much better place then when you guys broke up you could go back to court for a different custody agreement but the fact you haven't been sticking to the current isn't going to look good. It might be pointed out that you only take the kid when it is convent for you which isn't in the best interest of the child.\n\n**\"It\u2019s really inconvenient for me to drive through Friday night traffic for a 4 hour round trip to get Emma three times a month\"**\n\nHow can you tell Emma she is being ridicules for thinking she is a priority to you when you admit right here that you don't go get her on our court order scheduled time because the drive is to much of an inconvenience?

If one of your 3 kids that live with you get sick, do you ship them out of the house until they get better so the other two don't get sick? I am betting not.

I stopped reading when you told her how important it is to spend time together and how that time is legally yours.  So are the other weekends that you don't get her due to your inconvenience.  Obviously it is only important to spend time together when it's at your own convenience.  It doesn't matter how your daughter feels about it.

My ex has had primary custody of her since she was 2. I won\u2019t get into it but I was in a bad place after we split up and he swooped in and got custody. \n\nMy daughter Emma lives with him but I get 1, 3 and 5 weekends (6 pm Friday to 6 pm Sunday) plus two Thursdays a month from 6-8 pm. We alternate holidays and I get her for 45 days straight in the summer. \n\nHe\u2019s moved once and I\u2019ve gradually moved farther and farther.  We now live close to 2 hours apart. I\u2019ve remarried and have 3 little kids, two daughters and one son. It\u2019s really inconvenient for me to drive through Friday night traffic for a 4 hour round trip to get Emma three times a month. My husband does it on occasion but it\u2019s usually me and I have to wait until he gets home to watch our three kids so I can get Emma. He said Emma is my child and so getting her is my responsibility. \n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t get her too often. There have been years where, aside from summer when I ALWAYS get her and my holidays when I always get her, I have only gotten Emma for maybe 10 weekends in the year. \nThis year, I tried to get her at least once a month although it usually ended up being once every 5/6 weeks. I\u2019m just so busy with my little children. \n\nEmma told me at Thanksgiving she only wants to come for 2 weeks in the summer, because it\u2019s her time to relax and have fun without school. I told her absolutely not and it\u2019s important to spend time together. That time is legally mine. She\u2019s 13 and doesn\u2019t get to decide what she gets to do. She said I don\u2019t even bother to get her every 1, 3 and 5th weekend and it seems like I only get her in the summer because it\u2019s convenient for me and less driving. \n\nI often cry when we talk about this because I feel like she was stolen from me, but she told me that she feels like I\u2019m manipulating her by crying and that I cry so she will give me my way. That if I really wanted her, I would make every effort I could to get her. She said it makes her feel like my other kids are more important but I don\u2019t see it that way. My kids live with me so of course they're forefront on my brain. I told her she was being ridiculous. \n\nI was going to get her yesterday but she has a head cold and I don't want to expose my kids. She is not responding to my texts so I think her feelings are hurt. \n\nSo AITA? What should I do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
