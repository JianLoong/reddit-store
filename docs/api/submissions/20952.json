{"id": 20952, "submission_id": "14mlfyq", "title": "AITA for taking offense to my FSIL's concerns?", "selftext": "I (36F) was diagnosed with celiac disease when I was 8, years before gluten became a well known word. It was a huge adjustment for me and my family back then and it was certainly difficult but it's just second nature to me now and also it's all over easier these days.\n\nMy brother Adam and his fiancee Amy came to visit me and my husband for a week recently. We live on opposite coasts; I've met Amy several times but this was the most time I've ever spent with her. About a month before their visit, Adam told me Amy had been \"diagnosed\" with celiac (I'm putting diagnosed in quotes because they apparently went to a naturopath who diagnosed her after simply discussing her symptoms for a bit but whatever...). He was talking about how nice it would be for her to not worry at all about food on her visit because our home is almost entirely gluten free, save for my husband's cookie stash and I agreed, it's not even an accommodation I need to make; it's just my life.\n\nAmy, on the other hand, felt differently when she arrived. It was a miserable visit when it came to food. She treated anything I cooked as suspect and felt the need to lecture me on cross contamination constantly.  I'd say \"I used tamari in the stirfry\" and she'd say, \"I can't eat this, soy sauce has gluten\". This was multiple items that I would explicitly explain *how* I made them and she'd respond as if I couldn't possibly get it. I understand being cautious and I always am too but I felt like screaming \"I also enjoy not being sick!\". It's been almost 30 years, I'm probably the most well versed person on gluten that's she's ever encountered outside of a doctor. I didn't even care if she even ate the food at that point, I was just so frustrated by being treated like I didn't understand my own disease. No matter how many times I had tried to reassure her that my oven has literally never had gluten in it, the response was always condescending and suspicious \n\nOn the second to last night, I was slicing veggies for dinner and she came in and told me \"wooden cutting boards hold gluten\" and I said \"then dont fking eat it\". I really did not mean to say it, I had reached a boiling point and it just came out. Amy got really upset because I was rude to her and it became a big argument between all 4 of us with my brother yelling at me that I should, of all people, understand how overwhelming and stressful it was at first and to be more understanding. But I just wanted to not be treated like an idiot about something that ***also*** affects me. My husband defended me, Amy called me a rude bitch and my brother didn't stop her at all.\n\nThey avoided us on the last day and they're back home now. It's been almost a week since they left and I got a long text message from Adam today about me needing to apologize to Amy or I won't be invited to the wedding and that my behavior was \"unbelievable\". I don't really feel like I was in the wrong still but maybe yall will feel differently.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688085156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mlfyq/aita_for_taking_offense_to_my_fsils_concerns/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Speak to your brother about what was happening and why you spoke the way you did - you don't owe them anything, but you may not want to blow up your relationship with your brother over this.\n\nIf you can't see eye to eye, then you just have to decide whether it's worth making a fake apology for the sake of your relationship with your brother, or whether you leave the ball in their court as to whether you speak to each other anymore.\n\nDefinitely NTA though.", "NTA.  Consider yourself lucky if you're uninvited.  They sound toxic.", "NTA NTA NTA!!!!!!!\n\nI am also celiac and keep a gluten-free kitchen.  Anyone who eats with me can rest assured there is no gluten in their food.  Even my rolling pin is gluten-free.\n\nCutting boards that have been in use in a regular kitchen can hold gluten in microscopic crevices (I'm sure OP is aware).   A cutting board that has been used exclusively in a gluten-free kitchen will not have gluten.\n\nAs a celiac, I almost feel guilty when I get \"glutened\" at my daughters' houses.  They aren't dirty, it's just that gluten can hide in crevices.  It's not like bacteria, a living organism;  gluten is just a protein, a particle that can't be cleaned, say, in a dishwasher.", "NTA. Is she going to be apologizing to you as well? She was rude to you, repeatedly, in your own home. Who would keep pestering someone like that for days? Very immature on her part.", "NTA.  Put the ball back in your brother's court.  You made one impolite comment after being disrespected in your own home repeatedly every day for a whole week.  I think they have misjudged who deserves an apology.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t be talking down to you it\u2019s really rude. You can apologize to keep the peace but you don\u2019t have to. If you get uninvited from the wedding it\u2019s not your fault or your responsibility to fix.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would you apologize for?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot going to their wedding will safe you a lot of money, and you don't need a present. And you will avoid a lot of drama. Call it a win.", "NTA\n\nIf she refuses to listen to a seasoned veteran about it, that's on her.", "This is a case of someone being rude to you, in your own home, for a week and then expecting an apology when you finally lose your cool and are rude back.  Clearly, NTA.\n\nThat being said, do you actually want to attend these people's wedding?  If you do, then suck it up and make the most sincere sounding fake apology to Amy that you can muster.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry that my honesty based on your outrageous behavior was offensive to your precious ego\u201d. \n\nNope. Not sorry. I\u2019m honestly impressed you made it that long. You\u2019re a better person that I am", "NTA. My brother is allergic to gluten, and he isn't even as uptight as Amy is. She didn't seem to understand that you are also gluten-free, and felt the need to ridicule you.  Wooden cutting boards can't hold gluten if they've never been exposed to it, which again, she would know and understand if she got her head out of her ass. If your brother can't see how ridiculous and rude she was being in your home and to you, I'd consider it a small favor to not be invited to the wedding.", "NTA  Instead of watching how you do things, she was very condescending. The only 2 reasons to say any kind of apology is 1) if you feel bad about yelling at her, apologize only for that ( I would understand if you didn't, she deserved it)    2) if you want to go to the wedding. Sounds like they will hold that over your head (again, I would understand if you didn't, their loss if they don't invite you).", "NTA, she should be the one to apologize.", "Oh so NTA. I was diagnosed with Celiac back in 2005. I am super super careful. If someone who decided they were \"Celiac\" began to lecture me, I would not have been as nice as you.  She should have been grateful and used your experience as a resource.", " NTA enjoy a day off from those two cretins. Why do you want to go to the wedding? The dumb might be contagious or transmitted via cutting board.", "NTA. But you should probably just apologize. She seems trying but you live on different coasts and it\u2019s probably not worth you or her holding onto the grudge. Just know her naturopath will sell her on the fad soon enough.", "NTA. But I would have a conversation with my brother about what happened.  It wouldn't hurt to apologize.  And really, amy should apologize for being a bad guest.

In your place I would\u2019ve lost my cool after a couple of days. I get it she wants to be cautious. But even though I do believe certain homeopathic remedies work I certainly wouldn\u2019t take the word of a non physician about such a diagnosis. And she was being incredibly rude and disrespectful to You in Your Own Home! If she was THAT concerned she could\u2019ve gone with other options i.e go for takeout, ask to make her own food etc. Your brother should of at least tried to tell her to tone it down. They owe you an apology not the other way around. NTA", "NTA, you are more of an expert at gluten-free food and preparations than she is. Heck 30 years you should know a little something. If you do end up at the wedding, she might have hired the wrong caterer that knows nothing about preparations and get both of you sick. Best even if you apologize not necessarily go to wedding. If she is this wound up tight without the wedding, she may bite your head off at wedding even worse than at home, also create a fist fight.", "NTA sounds like SIL was upset that she couldn't be special because someone who was ACTUALLY diagnosed knew more. I wouldn't want to go to that wedding either. She will make drama, even if there isn't any, like magic!", "Honestly NTA.   I was tested for Celiac by an actual DR.  Until she goes and has the camera shoved up her ass during the colonoscopy she can\u2019t say she is anything.   I was tested for years for different things only to find out I have a iGg immune deficiency which can have the same symptoms as celiac and other diseases.", "NTA. You are literally the expert she needs to be learning from and she was treating you like you\u2019re an imbecile. You were more polite than I would\u2019ve been.", "NTA - she lost a golden opportunity to learn and she came across as a know-it-all.", "You weren't in the wrong. She's got that born-again vibe where she just has to tell everybody how to do things because she just found out about them. Not your problem, and she was incredibly rude. NTA", "NTA do yourself a favour and get uninvited, if she seriously believes there is gluten in wooden cutting boards then she\u2019s doesn\u2019t know what she is talking about. I\u2019m sure she may have a lot more problematic views and you only witnessed the tip of the iceberg.", "So let's see if I've got this. You have been dealing with celiac for 28 years. The only gluten in the *house* not just the kitchen, the *house* is your husband's presumably store bought cookie stash. You don't mention your brother's or FSIL's age, but I'm guessing they are younger. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if FSIL is 28 years old or less. Regardless, you've been gluten-free for most if not all of her life. And she has the unmitigated gall to second-guess you? I would have pointed all this out the first time she acted like she knew more than you. The second time? I would have told her to get the hell out of my house. NTA, and you have the patience of a saint.", "Also Celiac, and agree on every count!\n\nWhether she is or not, Amy ought to have at least recognized OP CLEARLY knows how to keep gf in her own kitchen after 30 frikken years! Sounds like Amy just want to feel superior to me honestly", "I legit don\u2019t know how my mom\u2019s wife trusts any food my mom gives her. She\u2019s celiac and my mom\u2019s got a lot of reasons she\u2019s forgetful af. We were having Indian takeout at my place that was gluten free and she was like ooh I can share leftovers with wife. Then she dipped her naan into the container instead of her plate and I was like AND now you can\u2019t.", "NTA NTA NTA REply frankly that you do not appreciate some wacko internet non real doctor not his patient (Amy) not knowing even the basics of the disease  you have been dealing with for almost 30 years, instead of someone who just thinks without real testing that they have that disease and you and your medical doctor have reviewed in detail everything that you did and nothing you did was wrong nor cross contaminated nor did it have a speck of gluten in it as you yourself do not want to die which could happen if you made a big enough mistake like she kept saying you did, but guess what not even a doctors visit for even mild symptoms just general Q&A to prove a point. But that you are so glad to be totally disrespected in YOUR own home by both him and her so thanks for making my week miserable! love your sister with full diagnosed by actual medical doctors celiac disease.", "NTA sounds like Amy is a drama queen, you won't miss much if you don't get the invite", "Amy is suffering from \"main character\" syndrome. Best avoid this drama as much as possible.", "That\u2019s really good to know", "Right? \n\nAmy has read some stuff on the internet and is now \"mansplaining\" gluten cross contamination to a celiac of 30 years\n\nNTA"]}
