I moved in with my parents as it has been really tough and I\u2019ve been getting a lot of support from them and other family.\n\nMy older sister, her husband and their two boys (4 and 5) were going on a trip and were passing through so my parents asked them to stay for the weekend. They agreed and everything was going great.\n\nOur kids were playing together when all of a sudden my daughter called me crying. I then walked into my older nephew calling her a stupid head. \n\nI called my sister over and told her what happened and we both talked to the kids and asked them what was wrong. Well turns out my nephew has a toy and my daughter wanted to play with it but he wasn\u2019t letting her touch it or look at it. He put it down for a bit and my daughter literally just picked it up for a minute and he grabbed it out of her hands and that\u2019s when my daughter called me.\n\nI thought this was a little mean of him and assumed my sister was going to make him apologize and we\u2019d move past it but instead she told him that it was okay and just told him not to call other people names. I asked her if she was going to do more and make him apologize as well but she said no.\n\n\u201cThat toy is his and it\u2019s something that he treasures especially since he\u2019s experiencing very bad nightmares and it\u2019s the only thing that brings him comfort. I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2018d tell your daughter that no means no.\u201d \n\nI thought this was really unfair for her to say. My daughter was just curious and picked it up while her son put it down. And I know this sounds a bit cold but it\u2019s not like he was experiencing a nightmare in the moment. \n\nI suppose I kind of rolled my eyes and told my sister that maybe she needs to teach her son to not be so mean and selfish to a child that\u2019s just lost her father and likely needs more comfort than her child who lives a VERY privileged life and can handle a few bad dreams that every child goes through.\n\nMy sister got very upset and called me crazy before telling my parents that they were leaving. My parents immediately asked ME what I did wrong and when I explained the situation to them they said that I need to apologize and I should feel ashamed for what I pulled. I was literally just defending my daughter. AITA?

Something like, \"When I get frustrated because someone won't let me have something I want, this is how I handle it.\"", "ESH you both need to talk to your children..your child has to understand that sometimes people just don't want to share...and your sister should talk to her son and say she knows its really special to him and that other children might want to play with it...so if that happens and he doesn't want to let go of that toy then mummy will look after it for him and keep it safe\n\nThey are 4 and 5 years old...they are still learning about the world.", "ESH", "ESH. Those who say a 4 year old should understand no means no have serious evaluation problems. Children of that age share their toys or not. It is hard to predict beforehand. But, for the children didn't get used to each other, it is very normal not sharing. It is very normal for them to share too.\nWhat is not normal is your and your sister's behavior. In this instant, your children are much more mature than you are. Instead of escalating, you must calm children down and tell them sharing is good. What you did was not defending your child. The problems you have don't entitle you anything. Leaving for such an argument is extremely childish. \n You and your sister should grow up. And finally, your parents should not take sides even though they are upset that your sister left. I think this is what is called as dysfunctional family.", "People here are very very mean. They are 4.\nNAH", "ESH, your kid shouldn't have grabbed a toy, no means no\nYour nephew shouldn't have called her names, that's never okay\nYour sister should have made him apologize for the name calling\nYou should've made your kid apologize for taking something that she was told not to. \n\nThe nightmares or losing her dad shouldn't have come to play at all. You both suck for bringing that up, as that wasn't the issue. He said no, there doesn't need to be a reason. She got called a ne, that's never ok regardless of the reason.", "ESH everyone for being adults but continuing an argument that literal 4 year olds were having.\n\nBut for the record, I believe that your nephew should have been encouraged but not forced to share. His toy so he gets final say over who can play with it.", "Yes on that last one! I forgot about that nastiness.", "On top using the dead father as bargaining chip. Not a fan of this.", "No I think you\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019ve just been stressed and like another comment said, I have extreme tunnel vision right now. I\u2019m still honestly slightly irritated but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth holding a grudge over. \n\nI guess I know deep down that I\u2019m in the wrong (regardless of if my sister is as well) and reading these comments... yeah. I\u2019ll apologize. I shouldn\u2019t have downplayed her son\u2019s nightmares as she does seem pretty stressed about it. My mother just told me that the whole reason they went on the trip is because the nightmares are getting really bad and they were trying to make my nephew feel better.", "I had to scroll way to far for auch a sympathetic take on it. Reddit is too quick to call everything right or wrong. Absolutely no nuance here.\n\nI agree with this, NAH.", "her refusal to apologize is what makes her an asshole.", "it\u2019s very clear that she doesn\u2019t understand the extent of \u201cno\u201d. no doesn\u2019t mean once im not using it (unless specified \u201cyou can use it when im done\u201d sister doesn\u2019t suck for pointing that out.", "It's not the sister or her kids fault. You shouldn't have to hide and hide toys so someone doesn't take them from you. It's like telling someone they can't leave their wallet with their belongings when visiting family and expect someone not to take their money (extreme comparison yes but at that age equivalent).", "My thoughts exactly.", "Parenting is really hard, I can\u2019t imagine how much harder it is when you\u2019re also grieving and dealing with a grieving child. I\u2019m sure everyone will understand.", "> reddit is way to quick to call everything right or wrong \n\nthat\u2019s quite literally the whole point of this subreddit.", "Having lost my Mum in the summer, I know I made some pretty distracted, un-thought-out decisions and comments. It's normal and forgivable, but OP needs to recognise this and apologise to take the lead in mending bridges.", "I think she still has time to not be an asshole if she apologises soon.", "That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. You take as a principle that no always means \u00ab\u00a0no you can not use it at all\u00a0\u00bb and I actually think in most situations with similar context, that\u2019s not true. Where does she get to play with other\u2019s toys usually ? Kindergarten, school, childcare, other\u2019s houses. Usually, the toys are to be shared in these places and the kids are told something along the lines of \u00ab\u00a0you can play with it when it\u2019s your turn, when he\u2019s not playing with it anymore\u00a0\u00bb and encourage kids to give each other the toys. Even at other\u2019s houses, some parents do want their kids to share, some do not. So there is a great chance that this 4 year old was just going with the rules she always learned was appropriate in a place full of toys. She wanted to play with something, the kid says no. Then he proceeds to play with something else. She thought it was her turn now and picked it up. And then it was snatched back so she thought something unfair was happening and called her mom.\n\nThis was the moment where her mom should have explained to her that not all toys are to be shared and that sometimes no means you can\u2019t play with it at all. And so she should ask if she can play with it after. But it\u2019s not like she was malicious or couldn\u2019t take no for an answer, if it was the case, she would have snatched the toy herself in the beginning. The sister clearly said that implying that the daughter wouldn\u2019t take any no for an answer and that\u2019s just not the case.", "those situations are not the same in any sense. in one, the toy is communal property where it\u2019s meant to be shared. the other is private property where she has been told no.", "They are different, but there\u2019s no way a 4 year old would know better if she never encountered the private situation before hand. Kids grow and learn to navigate the different situations with time, experience and parenting. Assuming that the parenting is the only responsible doesn\u2019t sound fair to me. You can disagree though, to each their own.", "it\u2019s very obvious that it\u2019s the parenting considering the way op is acting.", "It\u2019s the parenting now because she didn\u2019t handle this situation. But we don\u2019t know for sure that this situation happened before and that she didn\u2019t address it then."]}
