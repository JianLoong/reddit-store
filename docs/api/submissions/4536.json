I moved in with my parents as it has been really tough and I\u2019ve been getting a lot of support from them and other family.\n\nMy older sister, her husband and their two boys (4 and 5) were going on a trip and were passing through so my parents asked them to stay for the weekend. They agreed and everything was going great.\n\nOur kids were playing together when all of a sudden my daughter called me crying. I then walked into my older nephew calling her a stupid head. \n\nI called my sister over and told her what happened and we both talked to the kids and asked them what was wrong. Well turns out my nephew has a toy and my daughter wanted to play with it but he wasn\u2019t letting her touch it or look at it. He put it down for a bit and my daughter literally just picked it up for a minute and he grabbed it out of her hands and that\u2019s when my daughter called me.\n\nI thought this was a little mean of him and assumed my sister was going to make him apologize and we\u2019d move past it but instead she told him that it was okay and just told him not to call other people names. I asked her if she was going to do more and make him apologize as well but she said no.\n\n\u201cThat toy is his and it\u2019s something that he treasures especially since he\u2019s experiencing very bad nightmares and it\u2019s the only thing that brings him comfort. I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2018d tell your daughter that no means no.\u201d \n\nI thought this was really unfair for her to say. My daughter was just curious and picked it up while her son put it down. And I know this sounds a bit cold but it\u2019s not like he was experiencing a nightmare in the moment. \n\nI suppose I kind of rolled my eyes and told my sister that maybe she needs to teach her son to not be so mean and selfish to a child that\u2019s just lost her father and likely needs more comfort than her child who lives a VERY privileged life and can handle a few bad dreams that every child goes through.\n\nMy sister got very upset and called me crazy before telling my parents that they were leaving. My parents immediately asked ME what I did wrong and when I explained the situation to them they said that I need to apologize and I should feel ashamed for what I pulled. I was literally just defending my daughter. AITA?

In order to heal and move past this because one can never really forget such a tragedy, you need to have the therapy needed to work through your feelings and emotions on the topic because otherwise it will continue to pop up and faster in other ways. And you need to understand that you cannot assuage grief by giving way to bad behavior, and allowing it to stand with your daughter, when she does the wrong thing. You are sending her to the wrong message. Everybody has to experience grief in their lifetime. This is your opportunity to help her process grief appropriately. But making excuses for her behavior is not going to help her at this vulnerable stage. Granted, she probably was just curious and it was a harmless little mistake on her part really.

Unless they were getting ready for a nap or bedtime then a beloved toy such as described should probably be put up around other kids. I think the siuation got out of hand.

I think everyone is tired and stressed out, which is why I voted the way I did.", "Was it nap time or bedtime? It was my understanding the beloved very important toy was needed to help with sleeping, not technically needed at other times. If the toy was saved for sleepy time the other child would not have even known it existed. I never said the children shouldn't learn about sharing or boundaries, but sometimes it is best to avoid conflict, especially when everyone is going through so much. Thus, my vote of n a h...maybe it should have been e s h, but i was trying to be graceful seeing how everyone is having a hard time in their own ways right now.

And quite frankly, this whole situation was normal 4 and 5 year olds normally learning how to play and figure it out as normal 4 and 5 year olds do and your swooping in to white knight your daughter and save her from a childhood spat with a 5 year old is honestly pretty ridiculous.\n\nYour wording honestly makes it sound like the real problem is between you and your sister and being jealous of her and her circumstances.  And maybe that's somewhat expected and normal right now in your grief - after all she isn't the one with a dead husband and I\"m guessing that feels pretty unfair to you right now.  But it really seems like you're projecting that onto the kids and making their squabble a much bigger deal than it needed to be.", "YTA.

It's okay to have special toys that you don't want to share. It's also smart to teach kids that those types of toys are ones that we don't bring out when company is around or in the least, that we explain to others \"this is my special toy, please don't touch it.\" Clearly. Consent is important but equating every single thing under the sun to sexual/intimate consent is not helping anyone, least of all our kids. \n\nTeaching your kid not to swoop in and grab a toy that someone put down for a second is important, too. Especially if they previously didn't want you to touch it. \"Are you done with this, can I play with it now?\" Is a good skill to have. \n\nBasically just teaching both kids good communication would help this.

Children learn as they grow, if we let them.\nYour daughter was told no and grabbed the toy anyway.  Your sister was right that she needs to understand that no means no.

Your daughter turned to you because she counted on you allowing her to take the toy she wanted. In a kid world, that wouldn\u2019t fly.

In spite of grief, though, I am worried that you seem to show so little compassion for a young nephew who is suffering from nightmares. You don\u2019t know how serious his situation is. It could be something as deeply troubling as ongoing night terrors. Anyway, I\u2019m wondering if you are having any grief counseling or therapy. If not, I sure hope you will avail yourself of therapy for you and your daughter. My heart goes out to you, now please be sure your heart goes out to others who are suffering, too, like your little nephew.", "YTA. Your daughter was wrong and you missed an opportunity to teach her that she must respect others\u2019 property and boundaries.", "ESH but the kids. They are young and learning. I have no issue with the nephew getting upset that his boundary was being ignored but do think the aunt needs to at least make him apologize for the name calling and make him understand that that is not okay even when upset. OP needs to get her daughter to apologize for grabbing the toy after she was told no by nephew", "ESH.", "ESH.  Your sister should have made her child apologize to your daughter. However you took it too far. A child's trauma is a child's trauma you cannot compare one to another because each is just as important to that child. \n\nAs far as your parents I don't think it's right for them to demand that you apologize to your sister because I think you were both wrong you both need to sit down and say that you went too far but your sister also needs to make sure that her child apologizes for hurting your daughter's feelings as well for calling her names. \n\nAs far as playing for the toy, that is a wash. Children play with other children's toys and sometimes they don't want them to and they take it back no big deal."]}
