I feel for you- it sounds like you\u2019re currently trapped in a really shitty situation with someone who is your polar opposite. I see his blatant disregard for you, and that\u2019s fucking  frustrating. I\u2019m sure the lack of sleep doesn\u2019t help. I really hope the RA is able to help at some point. While I do still feel that the thing with the girl was a bit of an AH move, I get that you\u2019re really tired of all his shit and it probably bubbled over. \n\nIs there any possibility you might be able to wear headphones that connect to your phone at night? Not for the alarm thing, but to hopefully shut him out while still being able to hear your alarm in the morning. You really shouldn\u2019t have to, but if you\u2019re stuck with him and he refuses to be courteous, then it might be a good idea to preserve your sleep.", "Why? Cause he can\u2019t bring people over at 2 in the morning on weekday or play video games while screaming till 4 am on a weekday? He has said to me when I\u2019ve brought this stuff up that he does not care", "Even when I was in college, I never understood the attraction of a game that just makes you rage-face\n\nDoesn't seem fun at all to me", "That shared room shit is ass backwards, to my knowledge the UK doesn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in a prison or something", "My problem with it, though, is that some people who asked for doubles got singles. Like, they could have just swapped two people, literally in the same building and on the same floor, and we\u2019d be happier. But the fact that they don\u2019t even think about that makes it worse.", "Because this campus is about the amount of credits, not the type", "I have AirPods, but there\u2019s a chance they slip out in the night or the battery dies.

Even then, students can change their schedule without penalty most of the time during the first week or two of the semester so it's virtually impossible to use that for matching roommates.\n\nIt's a real crapshoot when it comes to random dorm assignments. Some schools may even purposely put different majors together as way of getting students to branch out and meet new people. \n\nI was halfway through my first semester when I learned that half (maybe less) of the rooms in the freshman dorm got Showtime. Their thinking behind it would be that people would make friends with those on the floor that had it and gather in those rooms to watch it. It wasn't very effective since most people who didn't get Showtime in their room didn't know it was an option and those that did get it didn't know some people didn't get it.", "Address even more simply by having people in single rooms? I'm not aware of any universities in the UK that have shared rooms as standard. Most of us think it's really weird!", "TikToks and Fortnite?

Also, an alarm going off - I'm guessing between 6 & 7 am - probably wouldn't be *as* annoying if he went to bed at a decent hour. I'm surprised the dorm has allowed him to stay after bringing people over regularly especially during the week and at the wee hours of the morning. The dorm I lived in, we couldn't have guests past 10pm during the week and have to give notice if we had guests staying over night which was only allowed on Fridays and Saturdays. I would definitely see about swapping roommates or perhaps if there is a vacant door available getting your own room.", "NTA. I am 58 and this reminds me of my roommate at 19 and still makes me shudder.  Keep going to your RA. Cite  irreconcilable differences. Get a new roommate. Damn. This is still nasty. But keep sticking up for yourself.", "It\u2019s good you\u2019re going to your RA. I worked in hosing, so I want to offer some other suggestions as well.\n\nAsk your RA to complete a roommate contract. Similar to what you have done, but it should be signed by you both and copies given to you both. This helps when room situations tend to go on.\n\nSecond: Ask your RA to speak to their supervisor. This is usually a Resident Director, Area Coordinator, Hall Director etc. Their job is to over see the community/area they are assigned to, and they could be a good resource. Most likely the RD/AC should know what is happening and can offer options.\n\nAsk for a room change. Ask to move into a different space/hall/dorm etc. I want to be clear, only ask for yourself to be moved. Unless this roommate has threatened violence, they are not going to move someone for being a dick, but they will move you. Also don\u2019t worry if they get a room to themselves, chances are it will not last long and they will have a new roommate once you move out. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nAs long as you're sticking to the agreed upon rules pretty regularly then I don't see the issue. Sounds like you've been pretty reasonable and let some things slide because there are exceptions when living with people. If you are being completely honest in your assessment and the problems come from only him then probably best you guys are rematched if possible.", "\u2026you understand that people live in dorms for the purpose of attending college, right? Alarm in the morning = necessary for making it to class on time (you know, the whole reason why they live in the dorm in the first place). Fortnite and random strangers late at night = not necessary for college and many dorms have rules against having visitors anyway. There is no boundary to respect for OP\u2019s roommate.
