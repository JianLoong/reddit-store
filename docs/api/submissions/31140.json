The other thing we said was that we would tell/ask each other if we were bringing people over so as not to drop people in randomly.\n\nOn Halloween night, which was a Tuesday, he brought 2 girls into our dorm at 2 in the morning, he had asked me if it was okay, and I had said \u201cNo\u201d. He still brought them in, so I talked to my RA the next day to help with this issue, there were other issues that were small (He constantly sprays hairspray in our dorm right next to me while I\u2019m eating, he watches TikTok\u2019s late at night at full volume with no headphones, and he\u2019s been screaming and being loud while playing Fortnite between 2-4 in the morning every night).\n\nAround 12:30 tonight, he randomly brings his fwb from Halloween into our dorm without telling me as I\u2019m working on homework and I assumed I was going to be dealing with the 2 girl situation again (he had sex with the fwb in the bathroom and left me with the other girl while I was laying in bed in my boxers). I yelled at her to get the f out and that I didn\u2019t want people in the room. He said I was being a little dick for no reason and I told him that we agreed on giving heads up for bringing people over and that I\u2019m tired as hell. He said that he was tired too from my alarm in the morning and I told him I was tired of him screaming in the middle of the night. He told me my alarm is worse and that I upset the girl.

Theyre typically the hardest thing to get", "Well very few people get a single room, so I'm sure you aren't the only person asking and not getting it.  That's not fair to the university. \n\nBut then again, the costs of housing and food is not fair to the students since it's profitable for the schoool.", "Nah, it was for yelling at the girl. Everyone is targeting things that I already said have been talked about and brought up between us.", "Why does he have to be on campus at all then?", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. If it\u2019s loud, then it\u2019s still going to bother the roommate, but I understand it can\u2019t be helped. I feel for you- it sounds like you\u2019re currently trapped in a really shitty situation with someone who is your polar opposite. I see his blatant disregard for you, and that\u2019s fucking  frustrating. I\u2019m sure the lack of sleep doesn\u2019t help. I really hope the RA is able to help at some point. While I do still feel that the thing with the girl was a bit of an AH move, I get that you\u2019re really tired of all his shit and it probably bubbled over. \n\nIs there any possibility you might be able to wear headphones that connect to your phone at night? Not for the alarm thing, but to hopefully shut him out while still being able to hear your alarm in the morning. You really shouldn\u2019t have to, but if you\u2019re stuck with him and he refuses to be courteous, then it might be a good idea to preserve your sleep.", "Why? Cause he can\u2019t bring people over at 2 in the morning on weekday or play video games while screaming till 4 am on a weekday? He has said to me when I\u2019ve brought this stuff up that he does not care", "Even when I was in college, I never understood the attraction of a game that just makes you rage-face\n\nDoesn't seem fun at all to me", "That shared room shit is ass backwards, to my knowledge the UK doesn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in a prison or something", "My problem with it, though, is that some people who asked for doubles got singles. Like, they could have just swapped two people, literally in the same building and on the same floor, and we\u2019d be happier. But the fact that they don\u2019t even think about that makes it worse.", "Because this campus is about the amount of credits, not the type", "I have AirPods, but there\u2019s a chance they slip out in the night or the battery dies. I\u2019ll try to grab some plug in headphones while I\u2019m home for thanksgiving break", "Usually dorm assignments for students that haven't specified a roommate are decided before classes are scheduled. Even then, students can change their schedule without penalty most of the time during the first week or two of the semester so it's virtually impossible to use that for matching roommates.\n\nIt's a real crapshoot when it comes to random dorm assignments. Some schools may even purposely put different majors together as way of getting students to branch out and meet new people. \n\nI was halfway through my first semester when I learned that half (maybe less) of the rooms in the freshman dorm got Showtime. Their thinking behind it would be that people would make friends with those on the floor that had it and gather in those rooms to watch it. It wasn't very effective since most people who didn't get Showtime in their room didn't know it was an option and those that did get it didn't know some people didn't get it.", "Address even more simply by having people in single rooms? I'm not aware of any universities in the UK that have shared rooms as standard. Most of us think it's really weird!"]}
