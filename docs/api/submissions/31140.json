Me and my roommate got randomly paired together and he came off as a douchebag right away as we were establishing rules and schedules for the room. I stated that I had classes at 8 and 9 am every morning, and that I\u2019d be going to bed early on the weekdays. He said that it\u2019s not an issue. The other thing we said was that we would tell/ask each other if we were bringing people over so as not to drop people in randomly.\n\nOn Halloween night, which was a Tuesday, he brought 2 girls into our dorm at 2 in the morning, he had asked me if it was okay, and I had said \u201cNo\u201d. He still brought them in, so I talked to my RA the next day to help with this issue, there were other issues that were small (He constantly sprays hairspray in our dorm right next to me while I\u2019m eating, he watches TikTok\u2019s late at night at full volume with no headphones, and he\u2019s been screaming and being loud while playing Fortnite between 2-4 in the morning every night).\n\nAround 12:30 tonight, he randomly brings his fwb from Halloween into our dorm without telling me as I\u2019m working on homework and I assumed I was going to be dealing with the 2 girl situation again (he had sex with the fwb in the bathroom and left me with the other girl while I was laying in bed in my boxers). I yelled at her to get the f out and that I didn\u2019t want people in the room. He said I was being a little dick for no reason and I told him that we agreed on giving heads up for bringing people over and that I\u2019m tired as hell. He said that he was tired too from my alarm in the morning and I told him I was tired of him screaming in the middle of the night. He told me my alarm is worse and that I upset the girl. I contacted my RA to let her know the situation afterwards.
