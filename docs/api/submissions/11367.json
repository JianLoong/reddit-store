I ask because the two of you seem fundamentally incompatible when one person doesn\u2019t want to be around dogs (totally fine) and the other is to the point of wanting your place to be a dog motel.", "NTA, you compromised once, now she wants more. She needs to stop. You already take care of her dogs when she is out of town although the initial agreement was that you DON'T take care of them in any way. Now she tries to push more. For some reason I feel she is one of \"rhosey people\". The ones that hear you state your boundaries, agree, but with the mind of pushing through little by little. She doesn't seems content with your initial agreement and apparently was planning to bend you into accepting dogs.

I can absolutely understand why your partner likes the idea of her friends bringing their dogs around.\n\nBut she knowingly chose to move in with someone who isn't comfortable with dogs.

You've already accommodated more than you actually agreed to, as you are now taking care of her dogs when she goes away.\n\nI don't think your partner is a bad person, I think she loves dogs and doesn't really understand your discomfort. But she is trying to have everything her own way, with you doing all the compromising and understanding, and her doing virtually none.\n\nIf you are willing to allow the friends' dogs over and you won't be around, I think this is one boundary you should stand firm on. Because it's actually more of a compromise than you need to make.

Neither of you should live together if this is the situation \n\nShe shouldn't expect you concede on this issue. \n\nNeither should you. \n\nI cant imagine a relationship like this working out. To me, a difference in values about animals is similar to a difference in wanting kids or not. Eventually itll becoming a bigger issue than it seems now. I could never live with someone who doesn't like cats and dogs, and I would never expect anyone who dislikes them, to live with them just for me. \n\nThere is compromise, and then there's giving up things that are important to you to please a partner.

My partner wasn't really a dog person when we met. I'm a crazy animal lady. If I had no impulse control I would have 20 animals. Instead I have 3 :). He doesn't like the dog hair, but he has grown to love my dogs almost as much as I do. I don't think it's a requirement for him to love _my_ animals but I don't think him disliking animals in general would work. It sounds like your partner is a lot like me where animals are family, including a part of other people's family. Denying friends family members to visit is upsetting to her. You have the complete opposite view (which is totally fine.) There's not really a lot of room to compromise here.\n\nGood luck OP!", "I don\u2019t necessary think Your an A\u2026 I mean you\u2019ve made your feelings clear from the get go.., but is a weekend with her friends and their dogs really worth falling out about? I dont like children but I still allow my friends to bring them into my home, because at then end of the day is it really going to ruin my life?", "NTA. Unless it's in a cage or a tank, I don't allow pets into my home. As I have already had enough of other people's pets destroying my home. If someone brings their dog with them, it can stay out in my two-acre yard and go dig that up. If the owners don't like that, then they're free to leave.", "NTA\n\nyour partner should have known your dislike to dogs\n\nAnd if the thing went down exactly as you said, youre compromising already so youre set", "NAH\n\nThe two of you have different views and that\u2019s okay. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to force you to like dogs but I do have to ask if it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re actually holding yourself back from liking them? From what you\u2019ve said of your partners dogs and the fact that you offered to look after them it does seem like you care for them on some level and maybe the only thing stopping you from liking them is just that you\u2019ve always been told not to get too attached.\n\nOf course, if I am completely wrong and you just don\u2019t like dogs it is totally fair for you to feel that way. If that is the case though, I have to wonder if the two of you are a good fit. If having dogs around is important to her and not having dogs around is important to you, neither of you should be made to feel like you have to give up on how you feel to appease the other.\n\nDid you tell your partner at the start of the relationship how you felt about dogs?", "Your partner is a boundary pusher. You don\u2019t like dogs. But you live with hers now - and even take care of them when she is gone. \n\nBut her wanting to have her friends come over with *their* dogs  to spend the night is too much for you. So you said you would spend the night elsewhere. But that\u2019s not good enough. You have to *be there, too*. Yea. No. \n\nHer friends can come with their special needs dogs that they can\u2019t afford to board- or not. That whole thing is *not your problem*. But you don\u2019t have to participate.\n\nAnd be aware of how much your compromising you do in your relationship is just you, (eventually), going along with pretty much everything your partner wants. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou've given a boundary you don't want crossed, and she wants to cross it.", "YTA\n\nIMO it depends on how often this happens. Once a month would make her an asshole.\n\nOnce or twice a year. Then that's fine.\n\nBut you never allowing it to happen makes you an asshole, assholes deal in absolutes. \n\nThis is something that should be handled on a case by case basis. It's not a 'my word is law' situation.\n\nI don't like dogs either, but I value seeing my friends over not being around a dog.", "NAH. Relationships require a series of ongoing compromises, and you're both going to have to figure out what you really value and what you're willing to bend on. You already know what you've compromised on - you're living with and helping care for two animals you don't have an attachment to and would rather not be around. Flip that around. What is your partner compromising on right now? My guess is that before you lived together she was able to snuggle with her pets on the couch, or sleep with them in bed at night, things which are likely very important to her.\n\nSo, yes, you've compromised already but she almost certainly has as well. The two of you need to sit down and figure out what visits from her friends have looked like in the past, what she wants them to look like moving forward, and what you want them to look like moving forward. Then figure out where you can compromise.\n\nKeep in mind that sometimes what our partners ask for already feels like a compromise to them. She might want to have friends over for doggy play dates every day, but knowing that would upset you she decides instead to only invite friends with dogs over on the weekend, for example. Don't assume that she's leading with her most preferred solution.", "This is a bit of a complex issue.\n\nBoth of you are kind of AH\n\nBut you may be a little more.\n\nYou are acting like this house is yours alone. Which it isn\u2019t. You are living with your partner but treating them as someone you can dictate to.\n\nRelationships are around compromise.\n\nYou need to learn to communicate better and come up with a compromise. The friends visiting even with dogs is temporary and you should be able to figure out a compromise that works for both of you.\n\nYou have managed to do it once before.\n\nSet boundaries and expectations for the dogs with the friends. Explain open and honestly about your feelings in a polite and respectful way.\n\nAt the end of the day she has a right to ask her friends to come over and if they come with dogs, because they don\u2019t reasonably have alternatives , or because your partner wants them to bring them, then that is not unreasonable. It\u2019s her house too.", "NTA \nthe only house I take my dog to is my moms... cuz she has dogs of the same breed as our current pup (15 week pyrenees) AND because I know my mom, her dogs, and her house and she wants to see Penelope\n\nTaking a dog to a new house with other dogs can be problematic...  territorial issues (and marking), food, aggressiveness, potty training, etc. I would be too worried about my dog to enjoy my friends.\n\nWe dogsat for my step daughter last year when we had a diff dog, but did a trial run with our animals first... to make sure everyone was OK with each other. \n\nIf you have dogs come to your house, it helps to do the meet-n- greet in the front yard... especially if you have guardian dogs who protect their territory (ie. Your house). \n\nIt sounds like you've compromised A LOT... I can't imagine having animals in my house I didn't want. You are a nicer partner than me. \n\nGood Luck.", "INFO - is your partner contributing to expenses or a SAHP? Or do they work but not contribute?", "NTA, I have a dog that sleeps in my bed, but I completely understand where you are coming from.  If you don't like animals either at all or in the house then she needs to accept that and be respectful of your needs not just hers. You have already made an exception with her dogs.  Isn't that enough??", "NTA\n\nI love pets myself but I can understand your sentiment. A relative of mine owns a Great Dyne and while the guy is absolutely lovely he can very much be overwhelming. Also his tail could classify as a lethal blunt weapon much like a mace.\n\nThat said there's only so many compromises you can make before something breaks.", "NTA \n\nYou already made exceptions for her dogs \n\nNow there are going to be strange dogs around? \n\nNo thanks \n\nMaybe she could get a shed/doggie house that her friends\u2019 dogs can stay in when they come over? \n\nA nice shed", "NTA your partner needs to understand compromise goes both ways. She also sounds immature as hell.  This is a hill to die on as she can't always have it her way.", "NTA. My house is strictly pet free and shoe free. If anyone doesn\u2019t like the rules, they can decline the invitation to come over.", "NTA, I dislike when people always insist on bringing their dogs to visit someone else\u2019s home. Unless you\u2019re close to their dogs, they shouldn\u2019t be in your house. The entitlement is real, and I say this as a dog lover", "As a dog person, NTA. I feel like you\u2019ve already made very reasonable compromises. If boarding costs are the issue, there are cheaper alternatives for her friends like having a friend watch the dog. When I was a kid, I occasionally made good money going over to friends\u2019 houses to watch their dogs while they were away on vacation.", "Oh, so NTA. I really like dogs, but unless I knew the dog really well.  I would not want a strange dog in my house. Everyone will say. Share to it on their life.  My dog is house broken. Wel,  guess what. Not. Sorry about that. Not cleaning up after it. You're asking for trouble.", "ESH", "NTA. Your girlfriend can move out and get own place and have all the friends and dogs she want. She\u2019s already crossed some boundaries that you seem okay with. She\u2019s going to keep pushing. I don\u2019t know why dog owners think everyone should just embrace pets. I had outside animals growing up. I loved them. But they stayed outside. I don\u2019t like pets in my home either. Op stick to your boundary. Her friends can get a pet friendly hotel and you all can meet outside at a park or something.", "NTA.  I don't and never will have pets of any kind including dogs in my home.  Dogs were always outside animals when I was growing up.  And no, you don't need to have other people's dogs in your home.  You have already compromised so much, this would be a hard boundary for me now.", "NTA but gf sound manipulative/immature as hell.  You've gone above and beyond accommodating dogs already and there's reason to be even more accommodating.", "NTA-just because they can\u2019t afford to board their dogs doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have options. Just like you watch your GF\u2019s dogs when she\u2019s out of town, they can find someone to watch theirs when they are out of town visiting you. GF doesn\u2019t get to count others\u2019 pets as a means of how to be comfortable in her own home because they don\u2019t live permanently in your home. You, however, also have a right to be comfortable in your own home, and that means no visiting animals. It\u2019s time for her to take her turn with compromising. \n\nYou two should also have an agreement about what to do when her dogs pass. Do you get a say in what she gets next?", "You've already agreed to have a relationship with her and said even when these dogs pass away you'll stay with her if she gets other dogs. That's a decision that you have made and I'm sure at some type of peace with. Now as for her friends coming over with their dogs, you stayed at this your house. I'm assuming you guys aren't married so that means this house in question sounds like something that you bought that you're taking care of the mortgage and is in your name. That means even though you guys lived together, it's your house. Her friends wanna come over even though you don't want dogs in your house. You're not obligated to stick around. She should accept that because you made it clear that you're not a big fan of dogs. If she can't accept this, then you need to start thinking about if her having dogs could be a deal breaker.", "NTA at all!\nYou have done well so far and compromised a good deal by agreeing to take care of the dogs when she is away. \nEven if we completely forget about all the past compromises, having a party where everyone bring their dogs is not \u201cstandard\u201d! You have a new home and you don\u2019t want dogs running around damaging and dirtying the house. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone would have argued with you if you said: I don\u2019t want kids in my party, but dogs are a sore subject. \n\nThe thing is, your GF have the right to chose how she lives her life, and if she thinks this is a deal breaker then that is that. But I feel like you should stand firm with this boundary as you have compromised enough.", "NTA \n\nTo be honest, I kind of feel like your partner lack empathy in this situation, she grew up with a completely different mindset and understanding of having a dog. I comprehend that. You made some compromises and even help her taking care of her dogs out of love. The issue here is I feel she manipulate your boundaries until you let go and give up. I feel that she disrespected you and your conditions by making it seems like your the problem because YOU don\u2019t share the same opinions about dogs.", "NTA. She is probably a great person, but something about this demand feels super manipulative and like sabotage of your relationship. You have been clear and fair, so why is she trying to trample on that with this odd request? \n\nIt's odd because bringing a bunch of dogs together for the first time for an extended period in a space that is probably too small for them is a recipe for disaster.  You would be forcing dogs, unfamiliar with each other, to form a pack in a stressful environment which can lead to normally calm and sweet dogs turning aggressive due to the need to establish dominance or hostile out of fear. This is a shit show waiting to happen. As an experienced dog owner/lover, I would never put my dogs in that situation or those of a close friend. \n\nSomething feels off here. You mentioned it as your home purchase. Is she pissed that you didn't buy the house together or aren't married? What are we missing?", "Thank you for the feedback. I'm the one who is more conflicted and so I'd imagine that would end up being me >_>", "That's an accurate way to put it. Her emotional bond is deep whereas mine is non-existent. We have some tough conversations ahead of us", "Thank you for thr feedback. I wouldn't go as far as saying she wants to turn the place into a dog motel. It's more \"I want to see my friends and that can only happen if they bring their dogs so ofcourse they can bring their dogs\" the house is owned by me.", "Thank you for the feedback. The boundary pusher comment from earlier made me laugh. Appreciate the perspective.", "That's a great point. She made it clear that she will always have a dog and I've made peace with that. I love her enough and our relationship is worth accepting this but I'm struggling with having to accept other ppls pets now too", "As another huge dog lover I agree.\nI feel like she is one of the people who listen to you setting boundaries only to try and change that later. It's like those couple where one person is pro kids and another is not, and they still build a relationship coz one of them thinks that not wanting children will change.", "Thank you for the feedback. She is definitely NOT a bad person and has done her part compromising such as not letting the dogs in my personal areas (master bed and living room) \n\nI am willing to not be around when they are over but I also worry that will leave me resentful. I've already accepted her dogs. Why should I have to accept other ppls dogs top for any duration of time?", "Absolutely this, I\u2019m the dog lover and cannot *not* pet any dog I see. My husband has a distaste bordering on phobia (?) of dogs and so dogs just \u2026 aren\u2019t allowed at our house. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m missing out on ever interacting with my friend\u2019s and family\u2019s dogs. Simply not at our house.", "Life is a gigantic compromise. There is still a lot of good in the relationship and we are both trying not to lose sight of that", "Agreed.", "90% of the time we get along great and don't have any issues. I do agree this fundamental difference is a huge problem and we have some tough conversations ahead", "Thank you for the feedback.", "I doubt that. It would be pretty much the same access the current dogs have. They would be staying for a weekend so a relatively short amount of time. I'm struggling with why I should be more uncomfortable with any additional amount. Isn't enough for current dogs? I'm seeing this as more dogs being added when I've clarified that I'm not uncomfortable", "I agree with above\u2026 NTA. I\u2019ve owned my own home for 20 years and I\u2019ve never had somebody bring a pet with them. Is this a common thing?", "Thank you for the feedback.", "Thank you.", "Thank you for the feedback. It's definitely a conversation that needs to happen. I know dogs make her happy and I've already made peace we will always have a dog.", "Thank you for the feedback. We do have some things to work on.", "Thank you for the feedback.", "Thank you for the feedback.", "Thank you for the feedback.", "How do you know it\u2019s his house? He could have moved in with her for all we know, or they could have bought the place together.", "Thank you for the feedback.", "I definitely see where you are coming from. I've noticed with each compromise comes even more compromises and I'm worried this will open the door to other issues. It's already difficult with her dogs and I'm struggling with having to accept being more uncomfortable for any additional duration time. Isn't accepting 2 dogs a co promise already? Why is it ok to add even more for any duration of time?", "Thank you for the feedback.", "Thank you for the feedback.", "Thank you for the feedback. I'm not holding myself back from liking them. I'm trying to be a decent human. I don't like dogs but I don't want them to suffer either. \n\nMy feelings were clear from the get go and the first year of our relationship. We would hangout at her place as dogs were not allowed in mine.

But friends, I feel like that\u2019s less common unless you have a lot of friends that have dogs. I think it\u2019s more of a thing for people to get care organised for their dog rather than bring it with them, having said that it sounds like one of the dogs in this situation need special care, without knowing what that is it\u2019s difficult to say whether they could just get a sitter or something similar", "Happy Birthday!

I was worried about the dog situation and cited that as a concern and we were able to work through that. \n\nShe was the one who asked to move in (4 times) and we both compromised in splitting the apartment so dogs have sufficient space and I have dog free space (living room and master bed).

Her friends can certainly make alternate arrangements for their pets.", "I genuinely do not understand the number of dog people on this sub who are dating people who cannot stand dogs. Given the fact that more people like dogs than dislike them it seems like the numbers game is in their favor so how does this keep happening?", "I genuinely hope you two find an arrangement where you are both comfortable", "That's the problem.... you have lived together for three years in her home and now you have bought a home and it's yours...not 'ours'.   Maybe just time to move on...", "\"You can invite your friends, but their dogs are canidae non grata in our home\" isn't very nice.", "You really don\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve made peace with it. Splitting a house in two and restricting where the dogs can go is an AH move.", "NTA. I have been the girlfriend in the situation, although I only had one dog,\u00b9my man was not as clear in his convictions as you are when we moved in together.  This situation and", "Nah but good luck making this work.", "NTA. There\u2019s plenty of people who absolutely love dogs and still don\u2019t want other dogs in their home for the safety and comfort of their own dogs and to make sure the other dog doesn\u2019t do something unpredictable like destroy something. It\u2019s presumptuous of someone, regardless of the situation, to ask to bring their dog to visit someone else\u2019s home and to assume there won\u2019t be issues between the dogs during an extended stay where some of the dogs will be in their home territory.", "Someone who loves animals is not going to feel great about their partners absolute dislike of their dogs who they love. What happens whe. Elderly, well-behaved dog dies and she wants a puppy? What happens if you have kids?", "NTA. I dont hate animals but I wont have any in my home either. My husband always wanted a cat but I said I never would and id rather not continue the rship if it ever came up. Thankfully after house sitting for someone with two cats and a dog he said he couldnt stand the animal smell and changed his mind but people who do love animals - LOVE THEIR animals and you were dumb to get into a situation where you\u2019re now uncomfortable.", "That isn't a middle ground??", "I'm so angry for you. I love dogs, but I don't love a lot of other people's dogs. They can be rude, poorly trained, and have a lot of issues. I don't think I'd want other people's dogs in my house unless I knew and liked their dogs. I like well behaved, respectful dogs that don't lick faces unless you allow it, that can settle down on occasion, and who don't jump up. \n\nI have a client who brings her dog during her appointments with me, and she spoils the dog so the dog never settles down and it's very frustrating.\n\nTo have other people's pets in your home like that would be super invasive to me. I know dog lovers that wouldn't want that. You are not unreasonable for wanting to draw this line. \n\nI think you should sit your gf down and talk about how she sees the future going. She knows you don't like dogs, but are willing to tolerate hers. Not love. Tolerate. How many boundaries will she push? How far is this going to have to go? When does your comfort start to matter?\n\nI know that you have two areas of the house that are dog free, but...how often does she want dogs visiting? Why does she think you have to go along with this? Did she have dogs visiting her home when you were staying at her place?"]}
