We\u2019ve had a bumpy time which included physical, mental, and financial abuse. I left him a few years ago and moved to another state. He started therapy and things were getting better, so we agreed that as long as he got a job and stayed in therapy that we could try again.\n\nThings went ok- there was no abuse, I had my own finances apart from him, and we established a good regular routine. Until he was fired from his job. I\u2019ve always been the breadwinner, so we\u2019re fine financially with my salary alone. We agreed to move back to where he\u2019s from for better job prospects. I was able to get a high paying job quickly and we moved cross country (3 weeks ago) and moved in with his family. I like his family, but I have no privacy and feel I\u2019m intruding. It\u2019s awkward. \n\nI just finished my first week of work at my new job and can already tell it\u2019s not going to work out. I would have already quit if I could, but I never quit a job without having another one. The commute is 1 hour each way so I\u2019m away from home 10-12 hours a day and I\u2019m on call all the time.  It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI have the opportunity to be a traveler in another state. The contracts are 13 weeks long with opportunity to renew. I have done the work before and enjoy it a lot. It pays more, has benefits, and covers lodging, a car, and money for gas and food. I figure I can do at least one or two contract periods until I figure out a better permanent situation.\n\nBut the first call I received about this job a month ago, I tried to talk to my husband about it and he completely lost it. He threatened divorce, that if we were separated like that then I should just consider our marriage over. He wouldn\u2019t even listen to me.\n\nFast forward to two days ago. He got mad because I\u2019m not  happy. I tried to explain I was stressed with the move, living with his family, the new job, the commute, etc. I tried to explain how I dislike my job. \n\nHe showed 0 empathy. It makes him feel guilty because I\u2019m unhappy, that it\u2019s his fault we moved, and he\u2019s afraid I\u2019m going to leave him like before. \n\nSat. night a work thing blew up and I went to bed crying from stress. On Sunday, I woke up, made the decision to pursue the travel job and a weight came off my shoulders.\n\nIt would be great if we could discuss it and decide on what\u2019s best for our family and each other, but it\u2019s impossible to have a discussion like that with him.\n\nWIBTA to prioritize my mental health and take the traveling job?\n\n*Edit: To answer some questions- We have no kids, own no assets other than my car and my retirement accounts from 10 years of working.
