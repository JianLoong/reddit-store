I have watched him order delivery for multiple meals in one day. I had to quit leaving my fancy orange juice in the fridge down there because he kept using it all for mixer.

I think he feels guilty, which I understand. And SB did kind of grow up in this house so I guess he feels it is his right to be here.

Obviously he just doesn't really like being at his place for whatever reason and I think he just feels comfortable here.", "A few years ago my youngest stepbrother was still living here as well. He was using his bedroom as a traphouse and had heavy traffic moving through the place, I'm talking 10-15 random dudes in and out at all hours every day. It took me like a year of bitching at my dad to get him to tell the kid that he had to either stop or move out. He moved out, and my stepmom left him soon after. Apparently they fought about it a lot.\n\nFor further context my stepmom would literally do homework assignments for her sons while they were at college.

What he is doing is breaking and entering,  which is illegal and can be arrested for. \n\nIf he wants to visit, he needs to set up a time and knock on the door like every other visitor.", "Pretty sure that is called breaking and entering? Maybe next time just call the cops.", "So he literally broke in? Call the police", "My dad knows how much I dislike it. Unfortunately, my dad is a huge pushover and doesn't like to make waves or step on anybody's toes. I'm suprised he was actually willing to text him last night to leave. I'm kind of  the same way I guess, thus the passive aggressive locking the doors instead of just going to him and saying \"Hey bro, I'm tired of you being here on the couch every day, it disturbs my peace. You don't live here, why do you not go hang out on the couch at your mother's house or your father's house if you can't handle being alone or something? I can't go anywhere else as my mother is dead and I don't have any stepparents to mooch off of\" (Do I sound bitter lol)\n\nIt's very unlikely that this situation will actually change. I'm moving out next summer so I'm just looking forward to that. Edit: Now that I'm thinking about it maybe this little debacle will have him reconsidering how much time he actually wants to spend here anymore. But I kind of doubt it. Again he seems very troubled and I feel bad but what am I supposed to do? I barely even know him.", "Him knowing how you feel and you two coming to an understanding/agreement on how to move forward is not the same thing.", "I understand it, he's like a little dog hiking his leg up on everything he sees.

I think everyone in my family would think I was an absolute psycho if I did something that extreme.\n\nI also seriously doubt the police would do anything but scold us for being stupid and to work it out on our own.", "He had the code to the garage door and then only needed to finagle the doorhandle to the house that\u2019s really only meant to be used on an interior door. It\u2019s the kind that has a twist lock on one side, and the other side just has a little divot that you can stick a coin or screwdriver or whatever into to unlock it. There is no key involved. I\u2019m sorry this just isn\u2019t a police matter. When my dad gets home we are going to have a talk about securing the house. I realize after reading the comments here it is pretty batshit insane in this day and age that we don\u2019t keep the house locked properly", "Fair enough.

Using a screwdriver to force his way into someone's home is illegal, no matter the relationship.", "Info: was your dad ever like a father to SB?\n\nYou seem to feel that the moment SB\u2019s mom left your dad, any familial attachment between your dad and SB ended; but if your dad managed to form a positive relationship with SB, 13 is a pretty key age for seeking a father figure to look up to. It sounds like your SB is really struggling, and he may be hanging out at your dad\u2019s house because your dad is his most significant/stable parental figure and he wants to keep a familial relationship.\n\nIf he did see your father as a dad, then I think the better response would have been to talk to him about how he spends his time while there rather than just kicking him out. I don\u2019t know what his mom or mom\u2019s new husband are like, but it sounds like he needs help and while you never had to see him as a brother, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a stepdad to just quit being a father after a divorce.", "You are NTA, but your dad needs to take the lead on this.  BTW Chicago is in the Midwest, lock your doors.", "NTA but your dad is the problem by him allowing the ex step kids to negatively effect his family.

The fact of the matter is that his mother left 2 years ago, he is 30 years old and has his own apartment but is spending multiple days a week on our couch contributing absolutely nothing, just drinking. He has his biological mother and his biological father in town and has a good relationship with both of them. Meanwhile my dad is my only parent and I pay $700 a month to live here and help clean. I\u2019m fucking sick of it. It seems more like a convenience thing than anything, and perhaps his mother doesn\u2019t allow this shit at her house or he doesn\u2019t want her to know how much he is drinking.

You\u2019re seeing how your dad\u2019s dislike of confrontation means he basically can\u2019t communicate or enforce boundaries and what it leads to. You\u2019ve said you can be passive too so after you move out I would do some work on yourself to really try to learn about self esteem and setting boundaries. \n\nYou\u2019re saying your SB is troubled, but you should not help him at your own expense.

But he is hardly a father figure to me and his other biological children, much less his stepson who has still had his bio dad around the whole time. He's well-intentioned and *does* a lot for us all (read: he is an enabler), but as far as actually modeling positive behavior, he is severely lacking. He also drinks too much and is the most conflict avoidant person I have ever known. So if somebody asks for something and he can manage it, they get it. One of my sisters (my least favorite sibling) literally makes more money than he does and he just loaned her 10 grand for a down payment on a house.

He's not trying to do anything with his life, he's just drinking himself to death and getting fat on the couch. Why this is exactly I cannot say for sure. As I mentioned in another comment, his mother used to do homework for him in college. He's just kind of helpless, and perhaps unable to break old habits. He actually does have a couple of friends and goes out occasionally. I believe a lot of the times he comes to crash here he's drunk, and it's just a conveniently located crash pad. I am unsure of why he is so reluctant to stay at his own apartment other than he is lonely, or he just doesn't want to do his own dishes and have to take out his own trash.", "Do you realize that is actually trespassing, right??", "Maybe they don't like him drinking so much and he knows your dad won't say anything about it.", "Hello.

They're actually both doing really well in life, so I'm not sure what happened here. But I am also the oldest, and my 3 younger siblings are all much more successful than I am. I have also struggled with depression and drinking in the past, but I changed my ways. Stopped drinking all the time and started walking and taking care of myself and my life is so much better now.

WHY is he spending so much time in your house? Your dad needs to tell him he cannot come over anymore. He is 30, not a child.", "This is excessive and kind of freaky. Sure he grew up there but he has his own place and he's not a child. I would have just gone back to my apartment when I couldn't get in, why do all this?", "As he used the screwdriver to get in he committed a crime.  Talk to your dad about this.", "I guess where I got confused is you keep citing that his mom moved out 2 years ago, and I\u2019m not entirely sure why that should affect how much time he spends with your father. \n\nWith that said, I think this comes down to two main problems:\n\n1. Your father is treating him differently than he treats you. Why is he welcome to be there as often as he wants for free, while you pay rent? Even if he thinks of your stepbrother as his son, you\u2019re also his child and it must feel like favoritism that the standards aren\u2019t equal.\n\n2. Based on your other comment, your father isn\u2019t exactly a healthy and responsible person either, and you don\u2019t want to be around even more of that than you signed up for in renting together.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s possible that your stepbrother has a deeper problem (alcoholism, depression, etc)? Or are you confident that this is just laziness and irresponsibility? If he has a problem, he may be hesitant to let his mom see it (for fear of judgment, consequence, damaging the relationship, or similar) while your father will see it as normal and accept it. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d have two conversations: one with stepbrother to figure out what\u2019s going on, whether he needs help, etc; and one with your dad, to say you\u2019re not okay with paying rent based on two residents if there\u2019s going to be a third person there half the time and leaving a mess. If he wants to view your stepbrother as his guest, then he needs to take responsibility for not letting his guest disrupt the other paying tenant. He can clean up after stepbrother and set boundaries, he can limit stepbrother\u2019s visits, and/or he can charge stepbrother a portion of rent and lower yours. \n\nOverall it sounds like maybe you\u2019d be better off getting a place away from your dad though; he doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy person, and even if you find a compromise regarding stepbrother, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if other tensions replace this one.", "They're an idea.  You could just hide all of the booze.", "No. OP pays rent and therefore has a legal right to call the police when someone gets into her home using a **screwdriver**."]}
