It is in your best interest to trade it in on a new bike if that is what you want to do.  You are under no obligation to sell it back to her at the price you bought it from her.  Now if she wanted it back you could sell it to for the same trade-in value, but not less.  Since she cannot ride it, what does she want it back for?  I think because she knows she can sell it higher (maybe has a buyer lined up) and is looking to make some quick cash off of you.  So sorry Lady but a deal is a deal.", "NAH. She chose to sell it to you for roughly half it was worth. You fixed a few things and almost completely paid it off and now she suddenly wants it back.

End of.\n\nNTA at all.", "NAH.\n\nThis one is tricky, you're caught between emotional value and practicality. No one can blame you for wanting to take the trade deal. And her wanting to buy it when she can't ride it seems like strictly an emotional thing. Making the trade deal for the bike of your dreams seems like the correct practical and financial decision.\n\nAt the end of the day, you're the official owner of the bike. So you get to decide what to do with it.", "You're in the clear legally, but morally, YTA. You feel like one because you are one, so no need to try and alleviate your guilt here. Sell the bike and rest easy knowing what goes around comes back around.", "One thing you don\u2019t want to mix with motorcycles is bad juju. Your call.", "Yta.  Solely because you acknowledge that you bought it for less than it was worth from a person who was grieving and now your argument for not wanting to sell it back to her when her head is a little clearer is that you have made modifications so it's worth more than you bought it for. \n\n It was always worth more than you bought it for and you knew that.

Let her deal with whoever has it if she wants it back so badly.", "NTA, no matter the circumstances, that was the deal. I'm trying to imagine the moment when I'm selling something important to me...  and ya... here is the first disproportion, because IF I'm selling something valuable for me  I will simply put a higher price, because... ya now it's valuable for me. Second, when I sold it, it's no more mine... and third, if that so important to me, that I want it back, I'm gonna be ready to pay the price. A deal is a deal.

Likely her deceased husband had a riding buddy offer 1-2k below value and she is looking to make a better profit. Too bad.\n\nYou have put time and money into the bike. Likely had to tighten your belt to pay it off. Don\u2019t feel guilty.\n\nIf you want an unethical tip, lie to her and say you gave it as a gift to an out of state family member or donated it to a charity auction. You could even say it got wrecked when a car merged into your lane without looking, luckily you escaped unscathed. Too bad the driver didn\u2019t have insurance/did a hit-and-run.", "No I wasn't ever planning on getting a harley to begin with, when I was in the class without offering the bike we rode were still too big and I and the teacher recommended her to going to an even smaller bike like a 300cc that's sized properly.

She contacted me weeks later and told me it's for sale, I went and looked at it, she set the price and I said I'll take it.", "this dude made up an entire story in his head about a motorcycle lmao", "Not even that. Just \"no thank you\". Or just make the trade and yell them where they can find it.\n\nEither way, nta and not their problem.", "That's exactly what I jumped to after she called. She's physically too small to ride it, I'm alot bigger and I struggle to throw it around at low speeds. It books more then double but trades less then double and the bike I want is the same as this books at. I usually let people walk over me and I'd normally just sell it back and take the loss. I've avoided posting it anywhere under my name because I don't like confrontation on it, hence why I just wanted to trade it and block her so if she wanted it she would have to buy it through the dealership", "Agreed. She wants to buy it back so it can sit in her garage and she can look at it occasionally? Nope", "Uh alot. I got the bike for 6500, put over $1000 and will be more after I go service it. The bike tradess for 10500 and books for 14300.", "True but I don't believe in bad juju so that doesn't bother me", "That\u2019s not quite accurate. People unload things for less than their true value all the time.\n\nImagine if she brought it to a dealership. The dealer is expecting to buy for less and sell for more. They\u2019ll make minor mechanical improvements, slap a warranty on it, and then sell it in an environment where you don\u2019t need to walk around with a stack of cash. Value added, everyone wins.\n\nWhile she certainly could have spend more of her time to extract more from her buyer, in that moment, she either wanted it gone or she needed the cash. Either way, OP helped her with that.", "Nah you got a misunderstanding on your conclusion there\n\nI'm not selling it because it's worth more. I'm selling it because I want a different bike.

It would have taken 1 min to google.\n\nNTA at all.", "She could have done the research. She sold it for what she thought it was worth. He will sell it for what someone else thinks it\u2019s worth.

You have chosen to forgo kindness, that she afforded you earlier, so you can come out ahead.\n\nThe kind thing to do would be to sell it back to her for the same amount, plus what you put into it, but in your own explanation you say you don\u2019t want to sell it because it\u2019s worth more than you bought it for- that was always the case. She did you a kindness as a classmate and you\u2019re taking advantage of the situation. You can choose to say, hey, it\u2019s just business, or you can choose to operate from a place of kindness. Technically you\u2019re not doing anything wrong if you take the profit but you\u2019re still kind of an AH because that bike is worth more than money to her and you knew it.", "Nah can't agree. She held onto it for a year, took the safety class and failed, waited a time period after the class, contacted me, set the price, and sold it to me. He passed away over a year before she sold it. She was long on choosing to sell or not. If it was a quick hey I need money, then sure, but for what she sold it for she WANTED the money, didn't need it.", "Trade, but yup.", "Lmao oof. I feel that, I'm 25 and can't afford a massive payment and this is like a lottery ticket to afford the bike I actually want", "If you want to be sure not to be the AH you can offer to sell the bike back to her but adding what you spent for what you fixed", "Did she know how much it would go for  when she \u201cset the price?\u201d Or did you rely on her ignorance at setting the price too low just after her husband died and she *needed the money.*", "Right? So weird how that story they made up is *exactly what happened* ...", "If you have the title - its yours. I'm sorry she wants it back. But, you are under no obligation to sell it to her at a lower cost after spending money on improvements to it.", "Or she has a sentimental attachment to it even though she can\u2019t ride it.", "Then do your thing man. Rubber side down.", "Desperate widow needs cash fast, but she should have taken more time to do ample research as to the value of her dead husband\u2019s motorcycle before selling it. I don\u2019t actually think OP is necessarily obligated to sell it back to her, but knowingly buying a product for less than it is worth because you know the person selling it is in a fix is like those loan sharks or pawn shop owners who make 100x the value of what the provide because they\u2019re kicking someone while they\u2019re down. But sure, it\u2019s the \u201closer sucker\u201d victim\u2019s fault. You sound like you blame scam victims for being stolen from, too. SMH.", "We don't even know if she thought it was worth that.

Anyway, it's ultimately obviously up to you. I can only tell you what I would personally do based on what you've said above.

She has to accept her mistake.", "Wat? She sounds like an adult who owns a motorcycle already and probably has some iota of an idea of what it\u2019s worth, people often regret sales when they need quick cash because of a bill or something like that, that doesn\u2019t make OP unkind nor would it make it unkind to say no, just the same way it would have been fine for her to say no to selling it.", "Everyone I've talked to and now posting it here says to go this route.
