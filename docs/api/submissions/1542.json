I once took my kids to my father's lake house when my son was a month old and it was awful. I was just around my parents too. I would tell him hey, this isn't the time BUT when your baby is a little older and your wife is feeling confident why dont we do a different trip? I do not think this is about wanting to be with his family and feeling you guys are snubbing the family, I think its missing the trip that's upsetting him. Just try to be as nice as possible.", "NTA\n\nA newborn would absolutely change the dynamics of the trip. Even if you aren't out late, babies are still easy to wake and establishing a routine. How is that going to work? Is he expecting everyone to be silent after 10? Is there enough room for her and baby? \n\nI wouldn't be happy either tbh. If he doesn't want to leave her alone or she doesn't want to be left with baby yet, that's perfectly ok, but he needs to sit this year out.

Why is he bringing a baby to the middle of nowhere just because he wants to have a vacation? And he plans to ditch the wife and baby in a place where there will be less access to help and supplies.

What a concept!", "Fellas, is it gay if you have friends?", "So at least you\u2019re consistently wrong!", "NTA yeah it is insane that he thought bringing a newborn baby would be okay without running it by the group first, assuming you guys are sharing a place. No  one in the house is going to be able to sleep, and he is  most likely volunteering you and your friends to babysit at least to come degree while being there.", "I mean, I get that he doesn\u2019t want to miss out on a weekend with the guys, but having a baby means exactly that - in the early years, you\u2019re going to miss out on stuff. That\u2019s the reality of parenting. He cannot have his cake and eat it too - it cannot be a trip with the guys and yet come back and have the family time. If he wants that, he needs to book his own accommodation, because A) nobody should be forced to share a house with a newborn who may or may not sleep very well and B) nobody should be forced to tread quietly on their weekend away that didn\u2019t originally include a baby and a mother. Neither is it good for the mom because if she spends all her day with the baby, she\u2019s earned to have a small breather in the evening, but I bet Jim hopes that if his wife and baby are there, then it\u2019s going to be the same as it was before and it just won\u2019t. He\u2019ll end up ruining it for everybody, least of all himself. I do wonder if his wife told him that either they all go or nobody goes and that\u2019s why he said it. \n\nFact is - the other guys \u201cdeserve\u201d to have their time to wind down and relax on this trip as well.

If offer wasn\u2019t extended to partners and kids why did he just assume? If he\u2019s not open to going someplace solo then simply wish him luck and extend invite when you do a couples thing.", "NTA. But I like how he wants to bring his wife so she can watch the baby and watch him having fun with his friends. That's a whole different breed of asshole.", "The issue is that this is not a baby friendly trip. OP is correct to point out that his friend coming with his wife who just gave birth and a newborn is not a good idea for anybody involved. A skiing trip isn\u2019t a hang around and talk trip. It would be like if I planned a get away weekend for a bachelorette party and someone announced they were bringing their husband and kid to it. It\u2019s not appropriate for the trip and it is rude to invite two extra people without even asking the people who are going to share a place with you.", "That\u2019s a good point, he told me he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go unless she came along with the baby.\nI guess she doesn\u2019t want to be alone yet without him there which is fair enough and a personal decision.\nBut yeah I guess he\u2019s trying to please all sides which won\u2019t work.", "I didn\u2019t even think about that. Yes. Fantastic idea. The wife can get up and down every few hours with the baby by herself, barely getting 5 minutes of sleep, not having a chance to eat or think about anything other than the baby, and probably having to clean up after her husband at minimum, while watching her husband drink, party, and play on the slopes without a care in the world. Is post partum a legal defense?", "Probably. If not then this could be the test case. And it even has its witnesses already prepared for the defence.", "He's looking for some free babysitting", "NTA. I doubt his wife would just stay cooped up in the house with the baby all weekend. If that were the case, she could just stay home. He should have asked rather than assumed his wife and baby could join the trip because that really would change the dynamic of the weekend. If he needs to be with his wife and baby, then he needs to stay home rather than bring them along and possibly inconvenience the whole group.", "NTA couples do this 'we are a package deal' thing and it ruins the weekend\n\nhe wants to be a single lad  for the weekend but the wife and child remind him that time in his life is over.\n\nhe must move to acceptance", "NTA", "NTA. A guys' skiing trip is not a place for partners and babies.", "No, man. NTA. One person cannot unilaterally change a trip like that. This is a boys' trip and if he can't make it, que sera sera. My bestie has a 4-1/2 yo and if she suddenly announced her hubs and kid (both of whom I love) were coming on a planned girls' weekend I'd say hell to the no.", "Also it will be great when the baby wakes up everybody at night. \nAnd does he really think he will go and have fun skiing while his wife stays back with the baby? I wouldn't be surprised if they doesn't try to guilt-trip some of the guys to babysit so that they can go out and have fun together.  \n\nNTA", "I think\u2026 that if you tell him kindly that whilst you understand he doesn\u2019t want to miss out, his idea wouldn\u2019t satisfy anybody and would leave everybody worse off, he may relent. Maybe if you try to turn it around (\u201chow would you feel if X now said that instead of us four, it\u2019s also going to include his wife and child, unplanned?\u201d), he might see it, but I guess he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t want to. He doesn\u2019t want to miss out on the fun because that\u2019s the fear that most parents-to-be have I think - changing lives to a degree that your old life/friends/activities disappear. But this won\u2019t be fun to his wife and it won\u2019t be fun to the other guys. \n\nI think proposing a families getaway that would happen at one point in the future might also be a good idea.\n\nOther than that you cannot really reason with him if he doesn\u2019t want to see the reasoning due to emotions. \n\nBesides - he is changing the plan after it has been conceived. This is not what the other guys signed up for. I\u2019m not sure about the dynamics of the group and how others would feel, but maybe if he gets told - kindly - that if he plans to come with wife and baby then the other friends may drop out and not go at all\u2026 maybe that might show him that it\u2019s not a good idea. Then again - he may take it even more that he is being pushed out so that might backfire. Either way, it should be made clear to him that the problem isn\u2019t his wife or the baby alone (you\u2019re not anti-his family) or that he is suddenly a father and therefore not one with the group but literally that for this particular trip with these particular plans the plan has never been the guys + significant others + kids, but always the guys.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd let me guess. Baby goes to sleep at 7 so everyone has to be quiet and stay in their room. Baby naps. Everyone quiet. \n\nThis changes the entire dynamic of having a guys weekend if a wife and baby are present", "NTA. Sounds like Jim needs to sit this year out.", "Wanna drink, nope got a baby around."]}
