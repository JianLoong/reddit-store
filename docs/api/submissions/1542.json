It\u2019s always just men and the group is made up of friends from both of us, some that I may not know well and vice versa.\n\nJim has just had a new baby he\u2019d mentioned that skiing might not be possible for him this year. That was of course no problem, even though the accommodation was booked, it was no issue from my side if he dropped out, the rest of the group can cover it.\n\nThen I got a message from him the other week saying he would come and his wife and baby will come too. His wife and baby would just stay in the accommodation every day whilst the group goes out to ski and then would be there when we get home every evening.\n\nHe didn\u2019t ask if this is ok, he just assumed it should be.\n\nI messaged back trying my hardest to be as nice as possible saying I didn\u2019t feel it was that kind of weekend, no other partners will be there and it changes the entire dynamic. It\u2019s not like we go out late but I don\u2019t want to worry about waking a newborn baby/or worry about myself not getting any sleep.\n\nI even said if it were more of a couples trip (which we\u2019ve done before) then it would be absolutely normal and lovely for his wife and baby to come, without question!\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to that weekend away if I knew from the beginning that this would happen. I\u2019ve spoken to one other friend who\u2019s coming and he also felt this wasn\u2019t ideal.\n\nJim has now said he feels like I have \u2018put him out\u2019 or treated him badly.\n\nHe\u2019s one of my oldest and closest friends so I need to know if I am in the wrong here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667647141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymr4xw/aita_told_my_best_friend_i_didnt_want_his_wife/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he has a new baby then he really should be staying home. Bringing the wife and baby absolutely changes the dynamic of the trip and he shouldn't have assumed everyone would be okay with that.", "NTA.  There will be plenty of other trips for Jim to participate in.  Having a new baby is exhausting and demanding.", "NTA. Even if it had been a couples trip, a new baby on a vacation with just married couples is not fair to the others. In this case it\u2019s always been a guys trip. You didn\u2019t change the terms at the last minute. If he has a new baby he should stay home anyway and help his wife.", "NTA. Jim is probably tired, and feeling pressure from his wife not to leave her and the brand new baby; and now he's going to take it out on you. Don't let him. \n\nTell him that it's been decided that this change in the trip is not ok for anyone else going; that you're sorry, you'll all miss him this year, but that everyone hopes to see him next year. Absolutely no hard feelings,  I'll call you when I get back, Jim.\n\nIf Jim chooses to get angry about this, that is absolutely out of your control. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA it\u2019s clearly not that kind of trip. But check on your friend. He might need some help and support as he\u2019s entering a new phase of life.", "NTA it\u2019s inconsiderate of him to just announce that he\u2019s bringing 2 people who will throw off the established dynamic without asking. This trip sounds special and it\u2019s rude to assume people will be ok sharing a space with a baby who will likely cause disruptions because that\u2019s what babies do. Also sometimes friend groups just want a little time together without any spouses and that\u2019s ok.\n\nI get him being disappointed but welcome to parenthood and the results of that choice. Parents end up missing out on some things. That\u2019s just how it goes.\n\n> Jim has now said he feels like I have \u2018put him out\u2019 or treated him badly.\n\nThese are things that he tried to do to the rest of you.", "NTA", "NTA. Honestly it\u2019s very frustrating to me when people defend the sort of thing Jim is doing. As a childfree person, I am happy to hang out with my friends kids and hear about them, see pictures of them and even do kids birthday parties and days out. However, if you want to maintain a friendship, you have to be willing to do the kinds of things that don\u2019t involve kids as well. Honestly, if you\u2019re a parent and you never make time for the people you care about without kids, or try to make every event into a kids event, I don\u2019t want to hear the complaints when you lose friends.", "NTA, Jim should stay home and look after his wife and child, skiing can wait.", "NTA, this is a men only event. Who would be comfortable with a woman and a newborn there? He can't have his Cake and eat it too", "NAH, sounds like Jim might just be missing out on guy time with the new baby around and this was the only way it was happening. Still, sounds like you handled it perfectly.\n\nIf it were me I might try to set something up specifically to include him, or even him and the family if he wants. He's just navigating new waters and trying to find a new social balance.", "NTA\n\nJim can\u2019t have his cake and eat it too. He wants it all: weekend with the guys and being with his family.", "Nta. As a mom, let me be clear: Jim going with the baby and mother is a mistake. It will be a terrible time for them. I once took my kids to my father's lake house when my son was a month old and it was awful. I was just around my parents too. I would tell him hey, this isn't the time BUT when your baby is a little older and your wife is feeling confident why dont we do a different trip? I do not think this is about wanting to be with his family and feeling you guys are snubbing the family, I think its missing the trip that's upsetting him. Just try to be as nice as possible.", "NTA\n\nA newborn would absolutely change the dynamics of the trip. Even if you aren't out late, babies are still easy to wake and establishing a routine. How is that going to work? Is he expecting everyone to be silent after 10? Is there enough room for her and baby? \n\nI wouldn't be happy either tbh. If he doesn't want to leave her alone or she doesn't want to be left with baby yet, that's perfectly ok, but he needs to sit this year out. He cant unilaterally decide this is whats going to happen when its a decision that is going to affect everyone on the trip.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So as he's a long time close friend, go visit him in person. Maybe plan on a walk or something that is baby friendly and keys you talk.\n\nYou don't need to talk about the trip specifically. Just be there as a friend.\n\nParenthood can be surprisingly lonely and especially a bit disconcerting if he's the first in the friend group to have kids.\n\nThere can be a bit of an adjustment which generally goes:\n1) Everyone single/unsettled, weekend trips whooooo!!!\n2) Some people have kids, weekend trips organized months in advance and many favour cashed in for childcare\n3) Everyone has young kids, kids go everywhere, muti-family trips.\n4) Kids get older, weekend trips revive. \n\nBut it's harder to make friends as you get older and takes actual effort.

It was rude of him to just tell you he\u2019s bringing his wife and infant without asking anyone. It does change the dynamic of the trip, not to mention, who wants to stay in the same place as an infant? Babies cry all the time, that\u2019s not a vacation I\u2019d want to spend my money on.

Life changes happen, learn to roll with it instead of trying to shoehorn your new life into the format of your past at the expense of other people. When you're the first person to have a kid you will find yourself having to bow out of some group events because they're not compatible with your new life.
