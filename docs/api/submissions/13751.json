It\u2019s bad enough he doesn\u2019t have a dad, but his own uncle is apparently so self-centered that he can\u2019t understand the perspective of a small child. On top of that, did you ever stop to think that you might benefit from being around a kid? it might help you be less cynical and self-centered. You might even enjoy yourself.", "YTA I\u2019m just wondering \u2014 do you care about anyone?  Sounds like maybe you are devoid of human feeling.  I know my heart goes out to your little sister who became a mom at 14.  I\u2019m sorry that yours doesn\u2019t.", "Wow the downvote crowd came out on mass. \n\nYou sure come across as a judgmental AH, you\u2019ve managed to dodge your sister for 5 years already so already you\u2019re barely involved in your family. I doubt she sees you as someone who is even remotely reliable to help raise a kid you\u2019ve avoided for half a decade. \n\nI\u2019m guessing English may be a second language due to the grammar and thus the use of fatherly may be more of a role model, someone this child could look up to but even at 24 you\u2019re clearly not there. \n\nSorry but YTA who is a little too judgmental of what happened to your sister at such a young age, not even bothering to see her in the hospital, staying away and shooting down what is likely her last attempt to have the brother she wanted to be in her life.", "Oyy, I'm sorry, but I don't think you are in the right here. You are actually obligated to help look after your nephew whether or not you like babies or agree with the circumstances of his existence, because he is your nephew. It's one thing if you can't or if the pressure on you to do so is unreasonable (you live in a different town, you have your own young child, etc) but you moved out in the first place to avoid having to deal with a baby in the house. At 19, which is a fairly normal age by which a person should be capable of dealing with a baby being in their proximity and crying sometimes.\n\nEveryone in your life is worried that you aren't bonding with this child who is family and was born at a time when the entire family - yes, including you - should have been on hand to help with him. 14-15 is not an age that can parent alone; no age really is, but especially not an age before the brain is developed and it's even legal for a person to work.\nThe parents are worried because you are, in fact, not bonding with this child, and violating an obligation that you seem to not even know you have.\n\nSure, you're being nice to him, the way someone is nice to a waiter or something, and you give him things occasionally, but you have clearly no interest whatsoever in your nephew, whose existence obligates you to take some sort of an interest in him. Your family is nagging you because they hope something about that will change.\n\n It's not about whether your sister made a stupid choice -- she did, she admitted it, and now the choice is 5 years old and if you continue dwelling and obsessing about this every time looking after your nephew comes up you will give him serious psychological problems. It's about the fact that you can choose or not to have your own children, but you have no choice about taking care of children in general unless you deliberately move far from your family. It also helps to be a Westerner, I suppose. Everywhere else, looking after the young of your kin group is a fact of human life. \n\nAn uncle (to the children of a sibling who is younger or close in age) has less responsibility than a father does, at least in patriarchal cultures (in matriarchies the brothers of the mother are the father figures normatively). But he still has obligations to his siblings' children. These obligations are not to the siblings, and not to the parents. They are to the children. Adult human life is about managing a network of obligations and responsibilities. Some of them are imposed unfairly and/but the involved person is not at fault; you are free to dislike them and complain about them, but it's bewildering that you believe you can reject them. This is your younger sister's son. She was 14 and you 19. At 19 I was engaged. The child has a need of adults in his life. You are supposed to care. If not you, who else? \n\nI'm sympathetic to the fact that you were young when he was born or whatever, but I have nephews and nieces who were born when I was in my mid-late teens, and I cannot possibly imagine finding their existence so annoying that I simply fucked off from home to live with a friend and refused the relationship with them that my culture expected from me. Whoever you are it seems clear that convention has demands of you that all your family voices, which you want Reddit (largely American at this hour) to tell you they're bad and wrong about.\n\nThey're not bad and wrong, dude. You're the sort of guy to fight with your 19 year old baby sister because you've been refusing for years to help her with her child that she had at 14, whom you have been bizarrely and abnormally not concerned with at all for 5 years except to remark to a forum of strangers about how much he annoyed you as an infant.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to be a father figure to your nephew.

You never signed up for that task. \n\nI will say statistically that kid needs a male influence. He has less than 30% chance not to be in prison at some point in his life. \nNot that this is the role you should fill. \nShe is the one who had a baby before marriage. It is her bed. Sadly a child will be affected by her decisions and yours as well. If you have time a strong positive male influence is always a good thing. Don't commit to anything but being around more would help the kid. So long as you and his Mom don't fight. \n\nIf you want nothing to do with it, again very valid decision and not a dick move. \n\nLadies, don't let randos drop loads in you.

Totally fine. Were you close with your sister before she got pregnant? You accuse her of making poor choices but she was literally 14 when she had him, still a child herself. Was it smart? No. Were the consequences terrifying for her? Good chance! Could she have used your support as a brother even though you moved out? Absolutely! That\u2019s the part I don\u2019t get.

Expecting everyone, including her at the time college aged brother, to put their lives on hold and bend over backwards to support her in her bid to be an adult when she's still a baby is ludicrous.

They knew their uncle loved them and I knew he loved and supported me. \n\nOP comes off as a judgemental, insensitive jerk. The way he describes it is that his baby sister wants her big brother to have a relationship with his nephew - not raise him or be his dad. \n\nI guess, yeah, he's under no obligation to have a relationship with his nephew or even his baby sister. But that doesn't make him NTA.\nHe's totally TAH... He can live happily with himself with the understanding that he doesn't have to do anything for anyone other than himself... Congratulations... His nephew is probably better off if that's the attitude he has when he's around him.\n\nI am so eternally grateful for my sweet brother. Thanks Chip for loving me through the hardest time of my life and being the coolest uncle ever!", "NTA for most of this.\n\nBut tbh you\u2019re the asshole for not going to visit her in the hospital. Giving birth was probably incredibly scary for your sister and it would have been nice for you to support her in that moment or few days.", "NAH, but it is so strange to read this post and replies coming from a close knit Hispanic family with 18 aunts and uncles that I'm extremely close to and that my kids are close to as well. Goes to show how different family dynamics are. I'm a very family oriented person though. It's ultimately your decision of what you want your relationship to be. Tbh, a little skeptical about your father figure comment. Seems like it came in after people commented about you not being an uncle figure \ud83e\udd14", "NTA, he's your nephew but you are not the one who had a baby at an early age. Your sister and parents probably need a little breaks but I have \na feeling that if you do it once, they will expect \nyou to do more and more... \n\nDecide if you are willing to take on that and ask them if they will start asking you to help out more and more. Because it's one thing to take the little\nguy out to Chuck E Cheese but then before you \nknow it you'll be expected to fix it again and again.\n\nI feel bad for the nephew as well... but you have your life...", "NTA\n\n\u201c Yeah I'm nice with him when I see him and buy him gifts sometimes, but I'm fine with the limited contact we have\u201d\n\nSo you act like a normal uncle. Thats all you have to do and you\u2019re already doing it. You already put in the comments that everyone was on board giving the daddy off the hook, so why are they pressuring you to be the daddy?? If they are backtracking on not having a daddy now they need to go back to the actual father. WTF did these idiots expect? That an uncle wouldn\u2019t act like a normal uncle?? The entitlement.\n\nYou are good OP", "NTA", "Sister got pregnant at 14(!!!), when OP was 19. \nHonestly? NAH. Everyone involved is still a virtual child. Where are the adults?", "NTA as long as you are nice and play with him during the times you are around. You don't want to take your shit out on the kid.", "I'm gonna say \"both\". Sometimes being unwavering in your feelings about something can make you seem like an AH to people. Especially when feelings and family are concerned. But I've also had some close female friends who had no business being a parent. They weren't mature enough, financially stable enough, or intelligent enough to be a good parent. But they literally said they were gonna keep it because they could make their family take care of it so they could lighten the load. That's not fair, and quite honestly, I don't blame OP for being honest about his feelings and sticking to them. I personally don't like kids either. I can be cordial to them for short periods of time, but I've done everything I can to live my life as child-free as possible. I even stopped dating women with kids because it always caused an argument when I'd refuse to sit their kids. So I get OP's position. If I don't want to be around kids and my sibling volunteers me to be part of the rotation for taking care of or bonding with her kid, and I'm expected to just because I'm family, regardless how I feel about it, that's bogus. She shouldn't have a say in whether or not he bonds with his nephew any more than he had say over whether or not she had the nephew to begin with. That being said, I can fully see how some would see that as an AH way to be, but I also feel like sometimes being an AH doesn't mean you're necessarily \"wrong\".\n\nLastly, the only thing worse than being disengaged, is faking it. Faking like you wanna be around when you don't, faking and taking the kid around and doing things out of necessity rather than genuine interest, kids pick up on that. They're not dumb. Going through the motions to appease everyone, knowing you want nothing to do with the kid or the situation, it would be obvious, and that's not fair to the kid either.", "YTA.  Assuming this isn't some made up story. Your 19 year old sister has a five year old.  She must have got pregnant at like 13.  That's rape so charges should have been filed.  At that age it's not a decision.  You can't consent at that age and it's a crime.", "NTA", "NTA. If you don't want to then don't.", "NTA, not your kid, not your responsibility.\n\nJust be aware that you are alienating most of your family and you reap what you sow", "NTA", "She had a kid at 14 and you\u2019re surprised she\u2019s acting up? NTA but fr how did your parents let things get that far", "I mean you are of course not obligated....\nDoes she specifically say that she wants you to be a fatherly figure or is that your assumption? She shouldn't be pushing you but I can understand her disappointment that you don't want to have any relationship with him. Lots of families have aunts and uncles that spend bonding time with their nieces and nephews, solely because they want to. It seems you are not really close with them and that you have very little love for your sister. That is sad but technically you're NTA", "I\u2019m going YTA. You aren\u2019t obligated to babysit, but it is clear you look down on her, so I can imagine she feels slighted. Sure you\u2019re not obligated to be a father figure, you don\u2019t owe this child or your sister anything, I guess. But it\u2019s a pretty miserable view to take of life if you resist basic interaction with a child in front of you.", "Shit answer.\nSister wants him to be uncle for 10 minutes.", "Im this uncle (although I'm 35). I don't really want kids. Never had the desire to procreate. It's just not for me. I've got things I want to/need to do in life. It just doesn't revolve around being a father. Nothing wrong with that.", "Yes I agree. Plus, when she had the baby he was 19 but hadn't decided to move out for any other reason by then. It kinda sounds like he's got some animosity towards her for stealing their attention but she had to have been 13 or 14 when she had the baby. \nThe kid will grow up and be able to ask you why you didn't want to know them though. You could chill with the 5 year old)(which is a cool age) without having to baby sit or anything. And it isn't fair for her to want you to be a father figure, but did she say that or that she wanted you to be a positive male role model? Because that isn't quite the same(imo)", "He was a teenager. He shouldn\u2019t have to be a second parent to her sisters poor choices. Whom I may add was also a teenager. If she\u2019s 19 and her kid is 5 now? She was 13 and pregnant.

You don\u2019t love them. At least own it.", "He is nice to his nephew in the comments he said he's nice to him and buys gifts when he sees him.", "Read the his comments she did as him to be the father figure.", "Read his comments she did ask him to be the father figure.", "He is a decent uncle read the comments she just keeps telling him she wants him to be the father figure.", "Ehh, at the time I moved out I do admit my sister and I weren't on the best terms. It wasn't anger but some feeling that just made me not want to be near her (or even my parents) so I thought I couldn't be as supportive as she needed. I thought the best was to not go to the hospital because I couldn't say anything nice, and sometimes is best to just avoid showing up if you can't be supportive, especially after something like giving birth. I visited them later when I was more calm.", "She was fifteen when she had the baby, 14 when she got pregnant. We know who the father is, I was not gonna beat up another 14 year old, that's pathetic.

Don\u2019t take her frustration personally, just understand that she likely felt rejected, and disappointed, and lashed out.\n\nAnd then you ask Reddit for help, so it feels like maybe you do feel a little guilty about how you handled things and maybe are considering rebuilding a relationship with sis?", "plenty of people dislike children.", "My grand parents had 6 and 5 siblings on my moms side so tons of cousins yet never met any of them.
