Maybe once he's older we have something in common and we can be friends, as of for now I don't feel like I'm missing out anything", "Totally agree with this,  my nephew and I went camping in Africa and had a blast", "I don't feel like I'm missing our anything, he's a little boy, we don't have anything in common so I don't know what we could do together.", "Yeah it's reasonable to ask, but I'm not down for it so why do they keep insisting? I already said no", "No, it's really not. Not if OP is not interested. It would be nice for her if he did, but OP is under no obligation. Some families are just like that.", "No, I do make emotional connections with other people just fine.", "It's literally stated In the post thats what she wants NTA but yeah OP could have been more kind but it doesn't make him the AH", "Also-my partner was so involved that they called him daddy and were scared of their actual dad. Everyone laughed, we realized that's very concerning for their development", "Shitty parents can still pay child support", "No sh!t. Maybe NTA for not wanting to be an uncle but in general a massive AH. He sounds like one of those folks who will sit on rhe sidelines of life and judge everyone else and have a shitty life and still think he\u2019s above everyone else. Being a decent human isn\u2019t mandated but your life typically goes a lot better if you are.", "You don\u2019t make this clear in your post.  You are fine being an uncle but not a dad which is okay.", "Then, my dude, you\u2019re fine. You may change your mind later and that\u2019s cool too. As I said, some people are just not comfortable around children which sounds like you at this particular stage in life. I would, gently, suggest to keep an open line of communication with your nephew and sister for the future, in case you change your mind.", "OP has edited this post which makes him sound less harsh than the initial post was written. I think boundaries are good but the things he is saying makes him seem like he doesn\u2019t give a shit about them whatsoever. It\u2019s one thing to not be interested in a fatherly relationship with his nephew, but it\u2019s another to basically tell his sister that she shouldn\u2019t have had the kid and he doesn\u2019t want to be around it and moved out to be away from her because a baby would be \u201cannoying\u201d for him. Boundaries can be firm without being an asshole", "I think you are missing the middle ground.  Can you just be an uncle and do fun stuff with the kid when you are together as a family or does that become her dumping more and more on you.   You said no to being a father figure, are they not respecting that?", "It\u2019s just not possible to \u201chave a bond\u201d with your sister if you don\u2019t show concern for her in times of need, and don\u2019t show interest in her life. I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re upset about. You are not required to be super\nInvolved with your nephew or to be his daddy. But it\u2019s just not possible to maintain a relationship with someone while completing ignoring their kids. People change and grow in relationships. If you don\u2019t change and grow as well, the relationship ends. \n\nI get what a major setback this would have been for you at 19. To have your life disrupted and to feel like you were forced to move out. I\u2019m also certain your sister went through a traumatic event: She had sex, was pregnant, and gave birth while she was still a child. All 3 of these things are traumatic, especially if they are happening in grade 7 (which is still primary school in many places). Many girls who give birth that young do so after sexual assault. Blaming your sister for not choosing an abortion is also pretty mean: 13-year olds are still legally children. That decision was of an incomprehensible level of complexity for her at 13. She is raising a child while\nIn high school. All around, your sister went through one of the most traumatic chain of events possible. \n\nI think really there are some issues surrounding this traumatic event, and your lack of empathy for kid sister, that you have to work through. Is it possible you put the blame for your misfortune on your sister and the child? Is it possible that this is a misattribution?", "It\u2019s not a personality trait. He is literally a young adult, I\u2019m not surprised kids aren\u2019t interesting to him.", "Doesn\u2019t seem like he hates children, he hates, more so dislikes, raising them. And why wouldn\u2019t he? Dude is still a young adult, and as he mentioned, at a stage of life where he doesn\u2019t want children or the added responsibility", "Uff, then take a step back and work on yourself.", "Yeah but you\u2019re not even being an uncle figure.", "How do you know she wants you to be a father figure towards him? Has she asked you or are you just assuming", "Just escalate the fun uncle gifts every time your sister or parents piss you off:\n\nEscalating for bad behavior\n\nBull horn,\nNerf guns with 300 pack of darts,\nDrum set,\nSquirt guns and water balloons \n\n\nRewards for good behavior\n\nIn door bounce house usually cheap second hand on Facebook marketplace place,\nbuilding blocks,  \nmop and broom kids cleaning kit", "A pregnant 14 was raped, to young to consent. Unless you live in a place that allows such atrocities", "\u2018Being nice\u2019 is the bare minimum to people who bag our groceries, deliver food, hold open doors for us. \n\nHow do you show care for family and friends beyond just \u2018being nice\u2019?", "Your edit doesn\u2019t help the situation because again it doesn\u2019t sound like your sister or family has asked you to take care of the child in anyway your just assuming. Also no one has asked you to be a father figure\u2026 what does hey do you mind playing with your nephew or spending a little time with equate to babysitting/taking care of/ being a father figure? Just doesn\u2019t make sense and your biting the bullet.", "You definitely don\u2019t have to be a father figure, but it sounds like you\u2019re purposely dodging the kid. There\u2019s a middle ground. Just treat him how you\u2019d treat a nephew who wasn\u2019t the result of teen pregnancy.", "Ok so you're TA for not wanting to be a part of your family. Pretty simple.", "Holy smokes. How messed up is that? \n\nThat is not parenting, instead it is as good as fostering them alr.\nYour ILs are messed up", "He seems overly wound up, I agree ,but I disagree you don\u2019t need to be an asshole with boundaries with your family at times.  Some times a strong slightly asshole approach gets messages across.", "He says they get together tho at holidays and bdays and he has got the kid gifts.  He is doing uncle things and doesn't want more contact/bond with a small kid.  That should be ok.\n\nI think they are missing the middle ground not op.\n\nI think his blunt presentation isn't helping much tho.", "In [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128z4bm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_bond_with_my_sisters_son/jelfj36/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) OP says that he is nice to the kid and gets him stuff when they see each other, he just doesn\u2019t want to do more than the bit they are all together for", "And. My mother has 3 brothers and my father has like 6 and I am close to 1 on each side. It is not OPs responsibility. He can choose how close he wants to be. He is not the AH here just because the mother wants him to be a father figure.", "Yes she said it would be nice if I was a father figure for Michael as he doesn't have a dad and he's growing up, our father is kinda filling that spot but she also wants me to be involved since I'm a boy too", "No, she had sex with her boyfriend who was the same age, she admitted that she wanted it and wasn't pressured (our parents made a big scandal of this and they also thought she was abused at first). Even now she admits she was stupid and that she consented to have sex with him, she was not abused.", "wouldn't that apply to a 14 year old boy as well? if the father is only 14 who raped who?", "My sister said it'll be nice if I was a father figure for Michael since he doesn't have a dad.", "I think if I had an older sibling that had a kid too I would treat both kid's the same, I just don't feel like I want to spend too much time with him or any other kid. I also don't visit my aunt who has kids, it's not only with Michael", "Okay", "Oh yeah they're insane. They \"love their grandkids so much\" but don't realize the harm they're causing by allowing the parents to be deadbeats. Fortunately they moved far away and don't remember we exist. SIL left BIL and neither are fit parents, leaving them with MIL all the time (which she encourages). I feel so bad for those kids and am sad we won't have a relationship with them until they're older, but it's not on us. \n\nI remember one night SIL was sitting on the couch playing video games and MIL cooked her food and served it to her. She told my partner and I one of us needed to feed one kid and the other one of us bathe the other kid. We were like wtf SIL is perfectly capable!", "Right. And he used an asshole approach, and is asking if he was an asshole. Not saying he didn\u2019t have good reason to be, but was still somewhat of an asshole about it.", "Yeah I saw that after this post.  He did a bad job of conveying a middle ground.  I mean he is coming off like his sister just pestered him an hour ago to be baby daddy for the 50th time.", "She asked you said no.  Will she keep bugging and you need to be a dick to reinforce or can you just be a fun uncle and buy nerf guns and super soakers?", "So why isn\u2019t the father being the father figure?", "Do you have anyone in your life that you love? Like, do you love your parents? Do you love your friends? Seems weird that you would not automatically love your nephew, just because he\u2019s your nephew. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean you have to be a father figure; of course not! But it\u2019s weird that you don\u2019t want to spend any time with him.  I feel like that\u2019s something that would just naturally occur.", "Because he probably wants to actually be a teen, and even as a mom, and as someone who grew up with a deadbeat dad I don\u2019t fault him for that at all. OP comments she had the choice of an abortion: more fool her for not having one.", "I was talking about the baby\u2019s father, not the OP.  Why isn\u2019t he being a father figure.  He has no excuse for ignoring his child."]}
