I said I had to check with my wife and she freaked out and said my mom can't cook anything. I asked my wife to cook the ham, and she yelled at me.\n\nAt this point I was sick of the bullshit.

Lastly, your wife sucks cause she's unwilling to compromise through many valid options because \"your mom sucks at cooking\" and \"a man shouldn't cook during the holidays\" and decided to get your daughter involved out of, what I can only assume to be, spite.

In an ideal world people could blend their traditions instead of forcing everyone to bend to theirs.\n\nUnless having pork in the house is a religious issue, a good host would just go with the flow, and a gracious one would probably make your mother a small ham so she could feel that her traditions were being respected.\n\nYou're NTA here, your wife is the one causing most of the drama. Your mother is causing some by having a \"weird\" preference but at least she is trying to fulfill it in the least obtrusive way possible.

It is not like she was asking her to do more work. Some people don't like turkey, your wife needs to deal with her issues because if she get this angry about 'tradition' there is something wrong with her.

Depending on how many people we had, we would make ham, too. Easter was always ham. My husband  mixes it up. They always have two meats. My MIL will do a turkey breast because she wants turkey sandwiches. However, there's usually ham or prime rib, too. In large part because my husband doesn't do turkey. Christmas will be any combination of those 3 meats.\n\nWe live near my family, now, and I host. We had turkey and ham. Christmas will be ham and possibly prime rib.", "When I make stuffing I make it in a casserole dish so ya it's like casserole.
