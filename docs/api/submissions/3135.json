Lastly, your wife sucks cause she's unwilling to compromise through many valid options because \"your mom sucks at cooking\" and \"a man shouldn't cook during the holidays\" and decided to get your daughter involved out of, what I can only assume to be, spite.

You\u2019ve watched your mom go eat on the street because your wife couldn\u2019t bend enough to let her pay for her own pizza. You\u2019re literally STANDING GUARD over a ham you\u2019re baking because your wife doesn\u2019t seem to respect you or your family and WOULD RATHER SABOTAGE YOUR HAM instead of letting her husbands mother eat her traditional thanksgiving dish. \nYou clearly seem fine with your wife bullying the rest of your family, so good for the both of you, I guess. \nMy only question is why anyone else in your extended family even shows up.", "That\u2019s truly horrible.  I want my guests to feel welcome and that means making what I know they like and absolutely without a doubt accommodating intolerances.  It doesn\u2019t have to require the use of an epipen for me to be willing to accommodate them. I don\u2019t want someone not being able to enjoy themselves.

She is unhinged.", "So stop inviting her.", "good lord - saying you will pay for it yourself and do all the labour isn't demanding and your wife making your mother eat a pizza on the side of the road is such abnormal behaviour - why can't you see that?", ">Once we wouldn't order the pizza she wanted and my wife wouldn't let her have it in our house, so she had it delivered and ate it on the side of the road.\n\nHoly shit I think your mom just became my role model. That is a whole other level of loopholes.", "JFC, your family is FUBAR.\n\nBest to just take the kids and move to Belize.", "It sounds like they're both just sticking you in the middle. Why is you cooking such an issue though? \n\nI think you'll have to cook to get the ham onto the menu. Or you all go to your mums so your wife isn't in charge of cooking and you can take over. Or is it really far away? \n\nI'm just trying to figure out a way that you might be able to make them happier. \n\nThe issue is it sounds like they're both stubborn and will throw a fit either way. It's just about minimising how bad the tantrum will be. \n\nWhat's the weird tradition about not having ham? Is ham the only thing your mum will eat or can it be swapped for something else that your mum will eat but isn't ham?", "Your mom sounds like she's got life figured out, honestly. Your wife on the other hand needs to calm the fuck down. Power tripping on pizza toppings, and holiday ham sounds like she wants control of every little detail and you just let her have it. No wonder your mom's fine with staying home. Why bother going somewhere you know you're gonna be miserable.", "Oooooh, that's... Put a spin on it for me. No wonder your wife isn't keen to accommodate. That's... Actually quite nasty of your mum! I hope you stood up for your (then) gf?

Not everyone likes turkey.", "\"I won't come if you refuse to have the food that I prefer to eat\" doesn't sound all that petty to me, actually?", "\"I'm sorry you can't make it, mom.\"", "Makes more sense why MIL and his mother can\u2019t be in the same room together.

Like they think it\u2019s just nuts on crust? I\u2019ve kinda given up on making it.\n\nAgreed on the turkey though. I\u2019m roasting a chicken.", "Any chance of a recipe for the pot roast? Because that sounds really good.", "Wanna second that...encouraging a child to handle a theoretically simple to resolve situation in such a poor way is...highly questionable to say the least.", "It's still about the principle. If someone said I couldn't come if I brought food I wanted, that person is completely unreasonable and I don't want to be around them.", "I mean, maybe she just doesn't like turkey? Not wanting to come to a turkey dinner because you don't like turkey and that's the main thing they're making is not throwing a fit she even offered to bring food for herself so it wouldn't be an inconvenience! She's just supposed to come and eat a shit meal she doesn't like and be grateful?", "Maybe she doesn't like turkey. I sure don't", "Yes. Dr pepper ham is a huge thing in Texas and other parts of the South.

But you're supposed to use Coke.", "She worships my MIL who tells her all kinds of things about my mom. She claims my mom is \"annoying and weird\" Currently she hates her because they are going to Disney during the Christmas season and my daughters always wanted to do that and my mom told her she doesn't want her to come because she is a brat (yes I absolutely chewed my mom out for that) though to be fair my daughter does always have an attitude with my mom", "Ham is about as easy as it gets, it wouldn't interfere with much of anything.", "My kids can have whatever they want unless it is a holiday, then my wife might cry. I can technically have what I want when we go out, but she might make fun of it a lot.

It isn't fair for me to never be able to spend another holiday with her again", "no my mom will eat most meats. My wife just thinks Thanksgiving means only turkey", "To be honest I dropped the ball. I was raised in a house where snarky jokes were just the norm and I didn't even think of it as offensive at the time. I said some shit about the men who dated my mom. My wife did explain why it was hurtful and I later stood up for her. I kind of had a revolving door of women before I got with my wife, so I don't think my mom thought she'd ever have to see this girl again, so needless to say that was awkward", "This is done in my home too. I don't eat turkey so my mom makes pork. Not everyone likes turkey . The wife is the ahh here. She offered to bring her own meat. This is just a stupid fight all around.", "My FIL hated ham so every Christmas I'd cook him a hamburger. It takes such little effort to make someone feel welcome.", "Honestly I probably wouldn't go either. I don't like turkey. What my ex's family did was get a ham steak for me to eat. Turkey is not for everyone. Hell, we're even having Italian today at my house because I don't do turkey.", "And such a simple solution, mum brings her own ham it's not hard.  I do turkey on Christmas, but one friend doesn't like it, so she brings a small ham.  Everyone's happy", "This is a stupid take.", "Because God forbid she would just come over to be in her sons and his family company for the holiday..no there has to be ham otherwise fuck them all.\n\nNot petty at all.", "When I first started dating my partner, I made chocolate bourbon pecan pie for the first Christmas i spent with them. My (very traditional Italian) FIL was like \"i don't like pecan pie but I'll try some\" followed by \"this is actually really good!\" And then he ate two more slices. I also bring them to potlucks with my friends and rarely have much leftover. I'll teach these Yankees what good food is one way or another \ud83d\ude02.", "Listen to yourself dude.

Or don't let them be together at Thanksgiving.", "Has your mum stopped making snarky jokes and comments since then though or does she still treat your wife poorly?", "I also hate ham (makes me nauseous to eat, actually, not just a dislike). When my aunt and uncle hosted they'd get me some grocery store fried chicken instead of ham and I'd munch away. My parents simply didn't do ham \ud83e\udd23 and did a nice beef roast instead.\n\nThe MIL literally offered to bring the ham herself. This dudes wife just wants a problem.", "I used to refuse to eat at my Dad's house on Christmas or Sundays because he always cooked turkey. I can't stand turkey. I'd get more enjoyment out of chewing a rock.\n\nNothing is wrong with OP's mom and the people saying she's 'weird' for not wanting to come if it means she has to eat turkey or only eat the sides and deal with his wife's judgement are weird themselves.

I hate thanksgiving food, I think most of it is vile. My MIL was very kind and always made a ham when we would come for thanksgiving just for me because she\u2019s not an asshole like OPs wife. Now that we live far away and my kids don\u2019t like it either, we make whatever we want for thanksgiving.
