WTF", "I was just going to say, the wife brought the kid into it, encouraging the daughter to share in the mocking of the kid's own grandmother and wife thinks she's not the problem? That's fucked up, let alone the \"not letting\" OP cook a ham in his own house for his own mother, even though it costs the wife nothing.\n\nOP, it would not be out of line to make the point that if anything does happen to the ham, you and mum are heading to Denny' s, and wife and kid will not be welcome to join you. They can stay home with their precious turkey thinking about how *they* ruined Thanksgiving for everyone else because they were a pair petty and cruel seventh-graders. \n\nNTA", "The mom sounds like a lot but I think the ham is symbolic. I\u2019m a vegetarian and if I couldn\u2019t come if I made/brought an extra dish I wouldn\u2019t want to go just out of principle, I wouldn\u2019t want to be in that weird ass environment.", "Seems op fell into the 'he married his mother' thing considering how both are acting", "I mean, both the mom and the wife sound miserable. \n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t have any other plans but I will only come visit you for the holiday if you cook a specific main course that you were not planning on cooking\u201d \n\nAnd \n\n> \u201cham is not for thanksgiving so I will absolutely refuse to have it on my table because that\u2019s not how it goes\u201d\n\nAre both miserable awful bratty things to say. The holidays are supposed to be about spending time with family. What\u2019s on the table should be second, but both the mom and the wife are making it the priority.", "it's also pretty crappy that the wife is dragging the daughter into it and turning her against her grandmother.  The wife is rude and rigid and teaching her daughter to behave the same way.", "And tbh if someone was coming to my house for a holiday and only ate pizza I\u2019d prob have a pizza for them lol.", "My childhood Best friend is Sicilian, so they always had baked ziti or some kind of pasta and stuffed artichokes at every holiday, alongside traditional American foods. I loved it and looked forward to it every year", "My dad and I can't cook,  so we get BBQ from this place in town. Considering how busy they are, we aren't the only ones who can't cook/don't like turkey.", "Exactly this!  Not everyone likes turkey and ham is a very easy additional option.", "Some people just don't like turkey.\n\nI personally don't really care about this either way, but it's usually perceived as rude if you don't eat food cooked, or only eat sides.", "Lord forbid the daughter marries into a Ham is for Thanksgiving, Prime Rib is for Christmas family.", "And she's teaching OPs daughter that it's okay to be a bully to her grandmother. Like, just how does the wife not think she's the asshole here?", "Also cooking a ham is about as easy as it gets. It's an already cured piece of meat. Throw it in a pan with some liquid of your choice and tent it with some aluminum foil tada. Your wife acting like it's a huge burden is complete b*******", "No, I even used a separate oven she wasn't planning on using", "Exactly!", "Going to agree. I don't think tradition had to be rigid, and should be flexible. I'm guessing your mom doesn't like turkey and is unwilling to even eat a little and just enjoy the sides. Then your wife is too rigid to also have ham.", "I mean, technically OP didn't say it wasn't a 50 lb ham /s", "A lot though to be fair she is fully willing to pay for them and do any involved labor, but if she isn't allowed to have the thing, she whines about wanting to go home. I've had conversations with her about how annoying her behavior is. Once we wouldn't order the pizza she wanted and my wife wouldn't let her have it in our house, so she had it delivered and ate it on the side of the road. Lots of little things like that over the years, wedding outfits, fighting over what to wear for pictures, how to spend holidays, and of course food. I do back my wife and we usually just do our own thing", "I called my mom a spoiled brat not my wife.", "OP called his mother a spoiled brat. \n\n\"My mom doesn't care about proper, but is just a spoiled brat who wants what she wants.\"\n\nOP doesnt seem to have done very much other than to offer the reasonable compromise of cooking the ham himself. Which has this result:\n\n\"She called me a mama's boy and called my mom stupid (because ham is only for Christmas and Easter) She even brought my daughter into the fight and they were joking about things they could do to the ham.\"", "It\u2019s not over a ham.", "Really?\n\nMother loves her ham ALWAYS. Since even before Op got married\n\nShe went out of her way to inconvenience NO ONE.\n\nShe got invited and offered to bring HER OWN ham\n\nWife says no cos she wants things to be 'proper'. Proper- that's all and you call Op a mama's boy.\n\nInteresting. What other if wife ain't happy, no one should be bs like this do you subscribe your life to?", "Yeah the mom not wanting to come if there isn't any ham is petty af. OP needs to stand up.", "Dragging the daughter and role modeling some really poor behavior.", "If I could order a pizza today I would.", "That or I'd at least let them bring their own pizza, like it's not that big of a deal", "We had Thanksgiving pizza! It was honestly so much less fuss than asking non-Jewish relatives to cope with a kosher meat dish, so they just slapped a couple of (nice) pizzas on the table too. Everyone was happy!", "My sister does this !  We start with Italian wedding soup, baked ziti, meatballs and pork cooked in tomato sauce for hours.  Traditional turkey and fixings follow .  It\u2019s an amazing feast and a day we all look forward to.  Happy Thanksgiving!", "We did this too growing up. Both thanksgiving and Christmas there would always be something Italian along side. Honestly his wife just seems insane lol", "I fucking hate turkey. With a passion. I'm making portobello pot roast and garlic bread and nobody can stop me. And the worst part about being a displaced southerner is that nobody up here knows how to make a proper pecan pie.", "\u201cSome liquid of your choice\u201d? Could I cook it in Pepsi?", "Then NTA, your wife\u2019s being a drama llama", "Your wife doesn't see it - but she's teaching your children terrible lessons here.  She's not modeling how to be a good host.  She's put made up rules ahead of her families happiness. She's being deliberately rude to a close family member. She's enlisted your daughter into making fun of Grandma and teaching her that there is only 1 way to do things.  What happens if your daughter marries a vegan one day?", "Here is the thing. Btw y\u2019all suck so I\u2019m going with ESH. \n\nWhen I cook, I don\u2019t want anyone in the kitchen. Especially when it\u2019s a big thing like thanksgiving or Christmas. Because you may not think so but you would be in the way, unless you have two kitchens where you have the ability to do this. Your wife is seems to be cooking already a lot of food and now you\u2019re adding more nonsense because you cooking a ham. For your mother. Who won\u2019t come over unless there is specifically a ham. Knowing that your wife is already cooking assuming a lot of fucking food. And you\u2019re only contributing to the meal prep to appease your mother who is throwing out ultimatums in a household that\u2019s not hers. Do you see a problem here???\n\nYour wife could\u2019ve made the ham. And you could\u2019ve bought a pre-cooked ham. Wait. Is it already a pre-cooked ham at least?", "*\"Once we wouldn't order the pizza she wanted and* ***my wife wouldn't let her have it in our house****, so she had it delivered and ate it on the side of the road\"*\n\nhold up - you said your Mom was willing to pay her own way.  Your wife wouldn't allow a pizza your mom was willing to pay for herself in the house?? - that YOU share?  How/Why?!?! Was it topped with live eels and oxycodone?  Did her pizza choice have something one of the kids was deathly allergic too?  Honestly this example makes your Wife the AH.  Mom just wanted her pineapple & anchovies. \n\nYour Mom and your Wife are more alike than either of them would ever admit.  Honestly your mom sounds easier to get along with since she'd provide her own 'wants'.", "Sounds like your wife is the spoil brat.", "Sorry, but it seems that you found someone equal to or worse than your mother. Because according to your explanation someone acts like a spoiled brat, but it's not your mom here", "Looks like they both are.", "My apologies. I misread. Saw this post around the same time as \"I called my wife a dumbass\" and conflated the two.", "Mom & her ham is weird but it sounds like Mom knows this about herself - OP said she made a turkey for the family and ham for herself.  She offered to bring a ham to this event.  She's not saying NOBODY can have turkey, she just wants a main course she'll enjoy - likely the same sense of 'tradition' as OPs wife feels for turkey.", "Who cares if she wants ham and is willing to make it herself? It harms no one.  OP\u2019s wife is acting like a psycho over food she didn\u2019t even have to cook!", "NTA. I'm tempted to also call your mother an asshole for basing her attendance on ham", "Literally choosing ham over her son lmao.", "Yo, she's trying to make her kid into being an asshole as well, the poster needs to step in on that", "Exactly. The wife is\u2026.. frightening lol", "Most ham that I\u2019ve ever bought is pre cooked so you could literally slice it & eat a piece safely. However, I often put it in the oven & bake it for a bit because I add a sauce. I think it cooks at the same temperature as the turkey.", "The mother wanted to bring and cook the ham herself.", "His mother offered to make the ham herself!! The OP\u2019s wife is the AH in this specific scenario.", ">Was it topped with live eels and oxycodone?\n\nGreat. Now I'm hungry.", "No, she just claimed my mom needed to eat the \"normal\" pizza and our pizza was \"good enough\" despite my mom trying to give us money for what she wanted", "I agree with you 1000%. Mom compromised in the past and tried to compromise right now, wife is a OCD freak", "From what I\u2019ve read from OP\u2019s other comments, both his mom and wife sound like absolute nightmares. My vote still stands. His family makes me feel better about mine.", "Does this strike you at all reasonable?  Your wife is a huge asshole.  I hope she's worth it.", "Your wife is looking for a fight, and determined to find one.  I\u2019d call your mom an asshole if she wanted a whole different meal, but this can be solved with a precooked spiral cut ham\u2014you wouldn\u2019t even have to put it in the oven.  Just pull some slices to heat up, put on a serving plate and done.\n\nTurkey is your wife\u2019s tradition, ham is yours, and millions of us grew up with both ham and turkey.  Geez.  We\u2019re having a roast dinner with a ham thrown in this year.  We\u2019ve done tacos and enchiladas before, with a ham thrown in.  If someone were coming and wanted to bring an already done turkey for themselves, I wouldn\u2019t care as long as I didn\u2019t have to cook it and whoever brought it didn\u2019t complain about what I served in general.", "Again your wife is a controlling AH on that.  Good lord there is no 'normal pizza'. Curious to know what she thinks a 'normal' is - what is the 1 pizza that your family is allowed to have?  \n\nwe ordered a bunch of pizza the other night with guests - there were 4 'half' pizzas - cheese, sausage & olive, mushroom-garlic- pesto, and honey glazed acorn squash.  They were all delicious.\n\nHonestly I'm starting to feel bad for your wife - it sounds like she has OCD/anxiety issues.  If she wants a certain pizza - thats fine. But again she's teaching the kids there's only 1 think that's right, when there's a world of flavor out there.  She is getting herself so upset over nothing, this is something deeper than just food choices, it sounds like she feels if she doesn't have everything just so she might disappear or the world would devolve into chaos.  If that rings true, be understanding of her anxiety - but it's her responsibility to get help for this.", "Jesus. I\u2019m not trying to be mean but how have you not divorced your psycho wife lol", "Why did you marry someone so damn terrible. Omg let people eat what they want why do Americans think Thanksgiving is about forcing people to eat your food instead of food they like instead of being thankful.", "Wtf is wrong with your wife? \n\nShe sounds cruel. And like an absolute control freak.", "Wife most likely doen't have OCD -- at least, we have no information to say she does -- and people with OCD aren't freaks", "People who have the mental illness OCD are not freaks.  Saying these kinds of things does not help those of us whose brains work differently.  Please be more considerate.", "They are all a nightmare 100%.  In this specific situation, the ham thing was on the wife.", "She claimed my mom's pizza wasn't real pizza because it didn't have tomato sauce (it did) and my my mom needed to eat either sausage or pepper and onion.", "Sausage pepper onion pizza sounds disgusting."]}
