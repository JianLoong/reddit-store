She reiterated that it was an emergency so I agreed, like always the kids were great and my partner is great with kids, they had fun with him and he was able to get them to bed quicker than I would normally.\n\nthis has happened a few more times, my partner has been around and she needs me to take the kids so we look after them together. And a few times when he knows i have the kids he's dropped by to say hi to them, but to also give me a break, normally about lunch time and making food for all of us\n\nShe knows that my partner had stayed with me during those emergencies and that he's stopped by a few times and she hadn't said anything. Today we went out for lunch and ran into my partner. I wasn't going to invite him but the kids begged him to join us so he did.\n\nWe had a nice time and at the end I paid for everyone on my sister\u2019s card like I normally do, out of habit really. I realised it also meant I paid for my partner\u2019s meal. I texted my sister before we left the restaurant and that if she wants I will reimburse her the amount, I also sent a picture of the receipt.\n\nWhen she picked up the kids I brought it up since I never got a text back and she said we will talk after she got the kids in the car. She gets them in and comes back and goes off on me for having a stranger around her kids and that I should have asked her before bringing him around them, she said she let the first emergency slide but that she found it weird that each time he would stay and that he would come round. Basically insinuating that why would he want to be around kids unless he had an ulterior motive.\n\nIf I'm being honest I got upset at this and told her not to talk about my partner like that, this just lead to more arguing, and in the end I just told her that I wont be looking after her kids anymore and she needs to get a baby sitter or start being an actual mother. After that she left and now I feel awful. I said what I said out of anger and I can tell it really hurt her, plus it would cost her so much to find someone else to take the kids as much as I do.

It was not the first time they met him and I assume you have talked about your partner often to her. I would maybe understand the first time but not after a couple time. 4) her concern is to a degree understandable but if something had given her that concern then she should have explained it / not like he watches the kids alone without you. 5) she had two kids  by choice without additional support, so she ought to plan better on how to get those care they need. \n\nSo much you are not the ass hole. I think your reaction to her insinuations is justified. Yeah, his ulterior motive is likely so he can be with you.  Dur.", "NTA. It's not like partner is a complete stranger to the entire family. If she's going to have you watch the kids for free, then she needs to understand that you have an actual life and you're not going to just drop everything for the kids. You love them and love having time with them, but from now on I'd make her give me at least a 24-hour notice for you to watch them. Otherwise, she needs to find other arrangements. And if she gives you the 24-hour notice and you can't do it because of a prior engagement, too bad. You are under no obligation to rearrange your life to convenience your sister.\n\nINFO: Is your mom or some other relative/friend available? A single mom always needs backup babysitting. Seems like she's just relied on you for so long that she hasn't thought about having backup or thinks she doesn't need it because she assumes you'll just always be available.", "NTA. It seems like she has sort of pushed you into the role of being her children's other parent and has gotten a little wild with entitlement to your time as a result. Even the fact that she thinks it's acceptable to say that she \"let it slide\" when what actually happened was that she interrupted your plans with your partner and had no respect when you said no. Also, it is one thing to be mindful of your kid's wellbeing around strangers, but to imply that your partner is some sort of predator without cause is absolutely out of line. The reality is that she chose to be a single mother and that means that she is solely responsible for ensuring the children are cared for and as lovely as your willingness to help her is, she isn't actually entitled to it.", ">she's a single mother by choice and the father to her eldest died while she was pregnant and her younger two were conceived through an anonymous sperm donor\n\nBut let me constantly call my big brother to dump my kids on and then get mad he gets a partner because then he's not replacement dad anymore. NTA.", "ESH, what you said is really below the belt and especially painful for a single mother to hear. I know as I am one. She is doing the absolute best she can, trust me.\n\nThat said, she is wrong as well, if she needs your help she should understand your bf is part of the package and not be so stuck up about this. Sorry, but her loss, you have a right to refuse, absolutely. But politely, not hurting her like this. You basically also ruined your relationship with her kids and have zero right for their continued affection.", "NTA\n\nShe's imposing on you to watch her kids as a favor.\n\nIf she intends to be judgemental, she can watch her own damn kids", "NTA.\n\nShe has presumably had months to bring this up and to meet him. I get being uncomfortable with a stranger but she could either stop bringing them or get to know him.", "OP, honestly ESH, she has been taking advantage of you as free babysitting for a long time now! But you made yourself available to watch her kids all the time. \n\nNow for your partner, that\u2019s great he wants to be with you even if the kids are there, and the kids seem to like him (they are great judges of character), but if your sister hasn\u2019t spent time around him and doesn\u2019t knows him, that can make her feel uncomfortable with a stranger being around them, so maybe you guys should change that, have her and the kids over with your partner for a dinner and to talk about this as adults. \nSure, you spoke out of anger for her insinuating your partner may want to be around her kids for the wrong reasons, (and that was wrong of her to just go there right away) but you were defending someone you care about from terrible accusations. So do something to change her perspective, and make amends.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like its time to let her arrange her own shit on herself. No1 made her get 2 more children on her own, except herself, so if your very cheap help isnt appreciated anymore, its time for her to hire babysitters.", "NTA. She chose to have children. You did not.", "NTA. Harsh, yes, but she's been taking advantage of you for free babysitting all this time. She doesn't get to drop her kids off with you at a moment's notice and then complain when you have someone else there.", "NTA.

Nah.  She's being very disrespectful and has done a dangerous thing with her emergency baby sitter.\n\nShe fucked around and found out.\n\nLet her find out what find out means.  No more  baby sitting in from aunt TimeMud", "Nta she can\u2019t monopolize your time with free babysitting and then decide who you\u2019re allowed to hang out with, within reason of course", "NTA. \nShe lost her right to be pissed about him after she chose not to speak to you about her \"concerns\" the first time. \n\nI guess it's a burned bridge on her end, now, because it's going to be a lot more expensive for her to find a babysitter for 3 kids (especially last minute emergencies) than it was for her to just cover your food/incidentals when they were with you.", "NTA. She is fine with a \"stranger\" babysitting her children over night but not with a lunch in public?", "Oh, I don\u2019t think either one of you are wrong in the situation. I think your sister is allowed to be concerned who\u2019s coming around her kids. Especially if she doesn\u2019t know your partner. You also are allowed to not watch her kids all the time. They aren\u2019t your kids so it\u2019s not your responsibility. If she is feeling uncomfortable, there probably was a better way to communicate that to you though. NTA and time to rethink your arrangement with her", "NTA.  She was out of line.  Not to mention how selfish she is to choose to have 3 kids as a single mother when she doesn't have the ability to actually be there to raise them and needs to regularly call you for favors.    She DOES need to start being an actual mother.    \n\nYou need to step away until she truly appreciates what you do for her.", "EAH - her for having more kids than she can handle alone and having double standards for your partner. You, your response was over the top, how about instead; you trust me with the kids then trust my decisions. If not, we need to talk about when I can and can\u2019t support you.", "NTA for saying you won't watch the kids anymore and also for having them around your partner, but it might be worth apologizing for your comment about her starting to act like a 'real mother.' \n\nIf your sister was oh so concerned about your partner's presence in her kids' lives, she would've (1) brought it up sooner, and (2) made attempts to meet this guy. And it's not like she wasn't aware he was there with you during those times. On top of that, you weren't leaving him alone with her kids to run off and do whatever, so I don't know what her issue is, really.", "NTA. You're still supervising the kids the entire time, so I don't see what the problem is. If she wants someone to give their undivided attention to her kids without any other people present, she should pay for a babysitter instead of imposing on you for free. \n\nIt sounds like she's got some thinly veiled homophobia and needs to grow up.", "NTA - Months?! Why did she delay talking to you if this was such as concern? Although parents are to be protective she is way out of line re: he has an alternative motive. It is insulting to you, him and the kids. It clearly demeans his contribution, how he jells with babysitting and the time spent making sure her emergencies were covered. At no point did she express gratitude. Now, everyone looses. Ok, you were angry but who would not be?!", "NTA\n\nWhat she said was homophobic.  I wouldn't forgive her for it so easily.  Especially with how much you've been helping with her kids.", "NTA, but I will say her fears are valid, and abusers are almost always someone the kids know and she\u2019s not familiar enough with him to really vet him properly. \n\nThat being said, she chose to be a single mother to three kids and expects you to help. Your boyfriend is gonna be there sometimes and if he\u2019s your husband one day, he\u2019ll be there most times! She should set aside time to meet him and make sure she\u2019s comfortable, or she can find a new sitter", "NTA She accused your partner of something vile. If she doesn't trust your judgment, she shouldn't leave her kids with you.", "While I understand that it is her kids and she should have a say of who is around them, she is dumping her parental responsibility on you as if you have nothing else to do. NTA", "NTA, she should have addressed this earlier as it has happened a few times and she never mentioned anything. OP, do you think your sister being uncomfortable with your partner around her kids has anything to do with his/your sexuality? It seems you are both men, just wondering.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a paid babysitter and she is interrupting your free time. Let her arrange her own sitters then and pay for them.", "NTA. Sure, maybe you were a touch too harsh with your words, but I don't think you were necessarily wrong. Either she's uncomfortable with someone being around or she is not, and she can't pick and choose according to whatever her circumstances are.", "NTA. She needs a babysitter", "NTA I've caught flack for saying this elsewhere but some modern parents are very entitled in regards to free/cheap babysitting and getting time off from their kids.\n\nI know you love them but you allowed yourself to he taken advantage of. She chose to have kids that she can't take of so she should live with it not you.", "NTA. They have sitter apps. She should get one!", "NTA your sister CHOSE to be a single parent. If she has emergencies she needs another plan in place instead of dumping the kids on you. Practice saying no.", "NTA she didn't care to find out during her \"emergency\" and the kids have met him multiple times. He's not a stranger to them or you. She fell down on her job multiple times and you're right. She needs to find a baby sitter (ack a stranger!) or take more responsibilty for the kids she chose to have. Sounds like she leans on you a LOT.", "I think that comment about her being a real mother was a bit harsh. Whether it was justified, I can not say. But you are NTA. You do so much for your sister, and your partner honestly sounds great. Your sister deeply insulted your partner. If she had a problem with him, she should've done something before. Whether that is to get to know your partner or to arrange other babysitting services is up to her.", "I felt like if she was only gonna let it slide the first time. She should have explained after that time she wasn\u2019t comfortable with him being around her kids. Thats on her for not communicating", "Exactly this. Sister can no more dictate who OP brings around her kids than she can dictate what pets OP adopts. If Sister doesn't like OP's living arrangement or social circle, then she can feel free to either make sure she always sets up OP's babysitting schedule waaaaay in advance to make sure the circumstances are to her liking OR she can find someone else to watch her kids.", "I can see your point, but I want to point out that the sister insinuated that the partner had ulterior motives, which is also definitely below the belt. While two wrongs don't make a right (which would justify an e.s.h. for sure), I can also understand OP not staying polite at her sister.", "She\u2019s exploiting him and emotionally manipulating him.  He put his foot down and I love it", "Came here to say this. I highly doubt she would have insinuated an alterer motive to a hetro couple\u2026 especially one her kids clearly love spending time with and we\u2019re babysitting on their date night for free.", "She's accusing him of being a pedophile, nothing really homophobic here, should probably learn how it's used before you know... use it.\n\nNTA bgw", "It sounds like she barely has time for her kids... I don't think she will \"set aside time to meet him\"", ">She should set aside time to meet him and make sure she\u2019s comfortable\n\nthank, thats a good idea, ill bring it up with her after we have both cooled off. \n\nhe came from an abusive home and is very protective of his younger sisters which is why i trust him around then, plus im never far. but she doesn't know him that well so i understand her concern.\n\ni gess what really pissed me off was her implications of him around children, becuase he was a victim of that kind of behaviour and was groomed, which made it more personal in some way.", "I appreciate this comment. I was initially less sympathetic to the sister but you\u2019re right\u2014 a good parent would of course be cautious of anyone she doesn\u2019t know well being around her kids. \n\nObviously the sister needed to have been more tactful in expressing herself so I agree that OP is NTA.", "She needs to PAY a babysitter", "I can't even imagine. We get to see our kids for a few months at a time, and never in those months, do I think \"huh, I wish I didn't have to take care of them today\"\n\nLike people need breaks, and I get that, but you've only got 18 years with your kids. You shouldn't be needing a babysitter for \"emergencies\" and personal time so much that you're burning bridges with your relatives.", "It is homophobic though. Straight people equate pedophilia to gayness as she did here.", "I would see it being a problem that she didn\u2019t communicate after the first emergency that he was there. That she understood he was there for it however after that she doesn\u2019t want him around the kids. She failed to communicate when she should have."]}
