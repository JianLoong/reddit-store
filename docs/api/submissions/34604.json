I have had employees come to me and say \u201cmy FIL died and I\u2019m thrilled.\u201d Look, that\u2019s a crappy thing to say but they\u2019re still entitled to their bereavement. It\u2019s not gaming the system unless the person didn\u2019t die, and it\u2019s not \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cmore annual leave.\u201d It\u2019s not annual leave at all.

Strange behavior from your gf.\n\nEdit: and bereavement time (despite the name) isn\u2019t really just about grief anyway. If your FIL died and you hated him, you still get your bereavement and I doubt supporting your spouse through that loss is a trip to Disneyland.

I hadn't been close to him in a few years, but hearing of his death brought back to many memories. It was really hard for me to think and process what had happened. I asked my manager if I could please take the day off, at 4am when I supposed to start work st 5 or 6... He said no. I tried to troop it out and do my job. But I spent most of my time randomly breaking down. When I asked if I could take any time off I was told no... \n\n\nNow at my current job, with a different company, I told my manager 2-ish hours after starting my shift that I needed to go home because my cat was sick.

First off, I'm really sorry for your loss. My grandfather passed about 5 years back. At the time of his passing, I hadn't seen him in over a decade, because I'd been a teen and then a uni student with no extra funds to afford to visit. I also lived at the other end of the country. I'm in NZ. My then work's policy was 5 days for a spouse, child, sibling, or parent. 3 days for everyone else. Grandparents, aunts, cousins, inlaws. My boss stepped up and gave me a week. So that I had time to travel there, and back. They organised for my leave to be paid out immediately so I could afford the airfare. And when we walked into the funeral, there was a large flower arrangement sent from my boss. My point is, my boss didn't have to do all that, just like your boss didn't have to offer extra leave. Mine did it out of kindness, and empathy. Just like yours did. Everyone grieves in their own way. And taking the time to visit with family and help is important given the circumstances. And taking a day or two to be by yourself is also important. Your girlfriend doesn't get to tell you how to grieve. If it's even remotely similar to the way I felt when my Pop passed, there's a lot of guilt and regrets. You need the time to process it. Good luck and look after yourself.

A few days to do whatever is perfect for when you've lost someone, and you're not sure about your feelings.", ">his kids deserved a week off, you did not.\n\nAnd who are you to decide who deserves time off when a relative dies?", "Eeh...yes you're exploiting since it sounds like three days would've been more than enough.  But since your boss suggested a week, I'm unsure what the big deal is.  You probably had better hope someone you truly are close with doesn't pass too soon though.", "This is one only you can answer. Will you really be mourning his loss during that extra time or just taking a few vacay days? Only you know your true motivations.", "NTA. You still knew him. You still need time to grieve. Besides, you were offered a week, so you took the week. Its not like you fished for extra time and deceived your boss.", "NTA. I think she's jealous, and that's not a good look.", "Take the week off, and spend the time looking for a new girlfriend. NTA.", "NTA and your girlfriend sounds kinda mean", "Break up with your gf, NTA", "NTA. I'm honestly appalled at your GF's audacity. It's strange your manager is more supportive of your grieving process than your girlfriend.", "NTA is your girlfriend an HR manager because your job didn\u2019t ask but your girlfriend did? Examine if you want your life managed this way. She sounds like an emotionless jerk.", "Sounds like your girlfriend is jealous of that time off. Who, in their right mind, would police someone's grief like that??", "!UpdateMe", "So you have a compassionate workplace but not a compassionate home life?  Look, grief works differently for different people.. I\u2019m glad to see your work respects that and would rather give you time to process rather than force you to work through it at half mast.  There\u2019s an unfortunate trend that has been burned into society where being a human with emotions is not allowed at work, it sounds like your gf still subscribes to this.  I can tell you that a pet death, NEVER covered under bereavement policies, can be truly devastating and many have to soldier on where being given even one day would have made all the difference.  That is in no way to compare the two losses but to highlight the extreme difference and show how very necessary the time you were offered is actually required.  Sometimes it\u2019s not about the specific relationship but rather the correlation to one\u2019s own life that requires time.  Seeing your cousins lose a parent may have stirred real anxiety over the very real possibility of losing your own parents in the near future.. that is what the week off is for!  NTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NTA\n\nWhy is your manager more supportive than your partner?!? You didn't lie, you didn't even ask for extra time, your manager offered. Your gf is completely out of line.", "NTA at all.\n\nWhen my uncle passed away years ago, I had to do a turn and burn...I flew from NV to PA on Tuesday. Went to the funeral on Wednesday. Flew home on Thursday and went back to work on Friday. It was awful.\n\n6 months later, one of my brothers died suddenly. My manager, who has family back east, didn't hesitate. She went to HR and said told them to give me a full week. I can't tell you how much I appreciated the extra time with my mom, other brothers, sister, and family.\n\nBereavement and grief have no time limits or rules.", "I took 3 days off for my mom\u2019s passing last year (she was 90, we knew it was coming, but still\u2026). I worked from home for a few other days. Taking time for yourself is not wrong. NTA.", "NTA and why is your girlfriend simping for late-stage capitalism? Smh", "NTA.  grief hits us all differently.   I had a close friend choose to exit life and it was devastating but due to many issues they had it was not unexpected.   I just hoped he was at peace.   A HS friend who I had not talked to in years who recently died unexpectedly due to Covid complications.  It hit me hard for many reasons.   My uncle passed away.   We were close when I was young but had not seen him much in recent years.    It hit my Dad hard and I needed to support him.  The memorial service hit me hard which I did not expect.  \n\nNTA.  your girlfriend is behaving oddly.  Your boss offered a week.  They are wonderful.  your GF is either odd or never really experienced loss.", "Your GF has no idea how you feel inside.  She needs to stop, and you can take whatever time you're allotted as needed.  NTA", "Your girlfriend lacks empathy and I hope is never in a management position. \n\nI am. And frequently I have people saying \u201coh I don\u2019t need all 3 days\u201d. I make them take it anyway. It\u2019s paid and many underestimate the mental drain funerals are and are grateful for the extra time. \n\nNever had any of my employees tell me they wished I didn\u2019t make them take all the time they could. \n\nYou are exploiting nothing. You have a good manager that understands you will heed some mental health days to recenter. Remember to thank her when you go back to work. \n\nYour girlfriend though\u2026.yikes.", "NTA, your gf is. This is crazy to me", "NTA, your grief is your own and you don\u2019t have to prove it\u2019s \u201cenough\u201d in order to be deserving of bereavement leave. Your girlfriend is being incredibly unsupportive, and this is a huge red flag.", "NTA. What is she, a cop? Damn, let a person live. I cannot imagine telling my partner not to take time off that was freely given to them, why would I want my partner to go punch a clock when they don't have to? How utterly bizarre of her.", "NTA. When my aunt died, I couldn\u2019t afford to go to the funeral or fly out to see my family. I stayed home but took the time off anyway. I\u2019m glad I did. It allowed me to process her death and honor her in my own way.  \n\nDon\u2019t let people bully you into mourning a certain way, especially if it\u2019s just to save company money.", "Why is your gf such a narc?\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nA week is absolutely right for this situation. It gives you a couple days to be with family to process his loss as a group, and then gives you a couple days to yourself to process his loss yourself. And, as you have already pointed out, you only wanted the 3 days until you were offered a week instead. If anything, your manager weaponized his death to get you away from work, which is obviously such a stupid sentence it's beyond words.", "Does his girlfriend work there too and have to pick up the slack? Otherwise WTF", "A lot of girls do not respect men\u2019s emotions.", "That's really lovely of your boss", ">Sounds to me it's because the girlfriend has a more accurate idea of how much support OP actually needs based on his real relationship with uncle\n\nThat's ridiculous.  I had a cousin that I loved dearly, even though the grand total of the time we spent together over a period of 20 years was about 5 weeks.  When I found out about his passing, I cried for a week.  I had seen him exactly once since I was 13.  It doesn't matter what the current relationship is when you love someone, you mourn as hard as if they had died when you were closest.", "There's something very, very wrong with you.", ">And what a good manager to sort of insist taking the week.\n\nWhen my Dad died (Thursday), I let my supervisor know.  I told her I'd be back on Monday (yeah right).  She told me if I couldn't come in to let her know.  Thank god she knew better than I did, because I couldn't come in that Monday.", "I was out sick the week before Christmas, told the boss I could have come back Thursday or even Wednesday, he insisted there was no need and I could take the rest of the week off\n\nI didn't want to feel lazy by milking a legit excuse, and I feel bad for coworkers left shorthanded (been on the other end of that fairly often), perhaps what OP's GF was thinking", "Dafuq you think bereavement means bruh?", "This comment reeks of the coworker who isn't in a managerial position who keeps track of what time everyone arrives at work", "He will spend time with family. He will also spend time alone. Both are important in grief and nobody should be judged for how they grieve.\n\nSeriously, you and the gf need to stick to your own business and not be asses to grieving people. I\u2019m close to considering you both bad people for this level of insensitivity."]}
