You were honest and upfront and oviosuly your workplace policies are generous on those grounds.\n\nTell your GF no one appointed her bereavement police force and go and take care of yourself, including cherishing the memory of your beloved uncle.", "NTA - I don't think so. You are likely to experience a uprush of emotions at the funeral especially if very close at one time. Funerals bring back old memories. It is sensible your work is planning for an extended absence as grief hits in funny ways. You may feel you want to work sooner but good it is not expected.", "NTA. It's weird that your manager is more supportive than your girlfriend.", "Find a new gf that not thick in her skull", "NTA - recently dealt with the passing of my father, and if you're going to be traveling or assisting in any way with the funeral/interment process (pall bearer/etc) then having a bit of extra time to deal with arisings is a good thing.", "NTA. Grief isn\u2019t limited to the days you will be with your family.", "Is she good and understanding in the vast majority of other areas of your life? I'm hoping so.

You didn't exploit anything a d tbh your girlfriend's reaction is a red flag.", "I think this is slightest of YTAs. Your boss offered (good on your boss),  but you did tell them you were going to use the extra time off to go and see your family and offer to help them out.

If you used the week to spend all the days with your family even if you were  relaxing some of the time I\u2019d say it was okay.\nBut to just attend the funeral for a day or 2 and then use the rest \u201ctake some time alone at home\u201d is abusing their generosity.

Is she resentful OP has time and she doesn't? It's not exploitation, it's understanding how humans work.", "Is it?

The other extra days you are using for yourself but not to grieve.\n\nLook,  i would likely do the same thing as you. Youre not hurting anyone and everyone could always use an extra day or two off work. But that doesn't mean that your gf isn't correct", "Ok, can we stop pretending the manager gave the extra days no questions asked? The manager asked OP if they needed more than the usually allowed 3 days and said they could give another 2. OP answered the 2 extra days would be useful to see their family and help out, but is actually planning to...not do that, but instead chill around their house. Is it a huge deal? No. Was he 100% honest? Also no, though he technically didn't lie. Maybe the girlfriend is overreacting, but also isn't crazy to think this isn't great behaviour on his part. Not so much because he took the extra days off, as much as his not following through with spending that time helping his family. Why isn't he doing that?", ">The other extra days you are using for yourself but not to grieve.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily say this. I will be using it for myself yes but I prefer to grieve on my own, it can be tiring for me being around everyone else.

Your post makes it seem like youre taking a couple extra days not because you want to grieve but because they were offered to you and you want a few days to do whatever.\n\nIf your gf is calling you horrible over this,  she likely has the same impression.", ">  Your post makes it seem like youre taking a couple extra days not because you want to grieve but because they were offered to you and you want a few days to do whatever.\n\nI'm taking them because they were offered yeah but it's mainly to be on my own for a few days since I won't get that when helping out with the funeral etc so I won't really get time to process anything"]}
