They\u2019re pretty serious, they\u2019ve been dating a couple of months. My mom (46F) passed away a couple of months ago. My dad, since then, now has a new girlfriend. \u201cTammy\u201d. (48F)\n\nFor a while, I felt like an asshole because she hadn\u2019t done anything for me to not like her. My dad and his friends kept getting on me to be nicer, how my mom would want me to like her and to move on, whatever. I didn\u2019t even get a bad vibe from her, I just didn\u2019t like her. But, who boy, did that change. Drastically.\n\nI\u2019m 18, I live at home, I\u2019m currently enrolled in college as a full-time student. Anyway, my dad felt compelled to mention to Tammy that my room could be organized (by her.) Weird, but I didn\u2019t want to say no, at least not in front of my dad. She then decided to, \u201cstart the process\u201d by, starting to attempt to rip the posters and pictures off of my wall. She stopped after I told her to. \n\nThen, oh then, came the contacts. I woke up this morning and unbeknownst to me, she came over earlier to help my dad clean our house. I internally groaned when I woke up and heard her voice, but that\u2019s besides the point. Anyway, I woke up and went to the bathroom to put in my contacts, which are daily pairs, hey\u2019re kept in a little storage box on the back of our toilet. So, I went to grab a pair, and\u2026.nothing was there. Not even the box where they came from, which I need to remember my solution when time comes for ordering more.\n\nI start looking around, in the cabinets, under the sink, even in the trash can in the bathroom. Everything was empty. A horrifying thought came over me. I went into the living room, and asked them if they had moved my contacts. My dad said no, genuinely. Tammy on the other hand, she looked at me, with zero guilt, and said, \u201coh\u2026so that\u2019s what those were?\u201d\n\nPanic sets in. I find out she \u201caccidentally\u201d threw them out last night. I freak out, because I have the worst vision in the world and can\u2019t see clearly 3 feet in front of me without them. So I blow up, to which she responds by saying it was my fault for leaving them out, how if I didn\u2019t want to lose them, I should\u2019ve put them up. I paid for those contacts with the money I got from my mom\u2019s life insurance (it wasn\u2019t a lot). If any of you know shit about contacts, you\u2019ll know they\u2019re expensive. I couldn\u2019t afford to go out and buy a new supply.\n\nMy dad isn\u2019t talking to me now, because he thinks I\u2019m overreacting. He agrees with Tammy, and says if I didn\u2019t want them lost, they should\u2019ve been kept safe. He\u2019s also refusing to buy me a new supply, on her insistence. I asked if he planned to buy me more to compensate for the loss, to which he didn\u2019t say anything at first, but to which Tammy said I needed to learn my lesson and some people have to learn the hard way that not everything in life is free, whatever the hell that means.\n\nSo, TLDR; My dad\u2019s girlfriend totally accidentally threw away my contacts, and then acted like it was my fault.

I say community because a lot of the community ones will have resources to help you get new contacts (not to be confused with the county health center). For example, we have one in the town I am in that helps with birth control, counseling services, psychiatrist services, regular doctor appointments and they also have social workers that help connect people with low cost dental, vision and hearing services and well as places for people to get food, formula, diapers, etc.\n\nAnother option is to check with the student services department at your college (they can connect you with low-cost vision/dental services, food banks, and things like that). If they can't help, try the college health services department. If no luck there, speak with an advisor. They may be able to help point you in the right direction. You will need accommodations in your classes if you can't see the work/white board, so they may have a place for you to go to get low cost contacts so that the school doesn't have to fill out an accommodation plan for you.\n\nIf none of this pans out, look up prices for contacts thru a vendor, like 1 800 CONTACTS or some place like that ( I know there's other places, this is the only one that comes to mind right now). They are usually ALOT cheaper than ordering from a vision center. All you will need is the name and address of the company that you had your eye exam at, and they will contact them for the prescription information.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Quite fertile seeing has how the dad was silent about the contact replacement until Tammy opened up. I mean, OP has a damn good argument against Tammy that Dad doesn't realize. This wasn't a box of tampons, it was something the OP needed for daily life. I think the OP really needs to move out however, she also needs to start moving anything that she finds sentimental about her mom to a relative or friends as I see the next things being thrown out are photos of her mother if Tammy is so 'whoopsie' about items. Also, Tammy did set up a pattern. If a few things 'disappear' (sent to a friend of OP's) that were important to dad that belong to mom, I wonder how quickly Dad would accuse her of tossing them out.", "All four + (my paternal grandparents are divorced/remarried) my paternal grandma\u2019s second husband and my paternal grandpa\u2019s second wife.

You need their help.", "If your school places their records online, you won't need the actual diploma. A lot of schools use Parchment to store the students' transcripts. I haven't needed to use them for my kids for a while,  but I think the cost was $2.99 to send them to the colleges my kids were interested in. Also, FASFA doesn't ask for your diploma. They do ask for the graduation date, school location, etc, but not for the actual diploma. Also, please keep this in mind... you may not get any federal financial aid right away (due to your age, your moms income may be counted on your form), but some schools will give need-based scholarships if you apply and explain the situation. Most will only do this once you are turned down or have your results from FASFA. Another thing to keep in mind. I believe the cut-off age that includes parental income on the FASFA form is 24. Meaning once you turn 24, only your income will be considered (I could be off by a year on the exact age). If you don't have your mom's income information, there is a place to put her name and a box to check that says you don't know the information. Most of the income information is auto-filled on the form once you are directed to the IRS link. \n\nThe FASFA will automatically save as you are filling it out. So you can always start the process, and if you get to an area that you don't have the information for, just click \"save\" and you will be able to come back to it later and finish the application. \n\nSorry if this is all confusing. \n\nTLDR: \n1. Check with the high school to see if they send transcripts or if they use a \"transcript service\" to send it.\n2. Start the FASFA and click \"save\" if you get stuck on something and go back to it.\n3. If you get declined because your mom's income is included, talk to the financial aid office to see if you qualify for a need-based scholarship.\n4. If you get declined because of your mom's income, keep in mind that this will change once you are old enough to not have her income included.\n\nEdit:\n5. IF you do need your diploma, your school most likely won't have it. You will need to call the school board/administration for the district. Example: you attend \"Jordan High School\" in the East city school district. You would contact the administration offices of the East city school district.", "The school district office should be able to give you a transcript showing you graduated for under $10.", "That\u2019s great to hear!* I\u2019m glad you have both sides to support you - please consider letting them know just how bad it\u2019s been at home lately.

You don\u2019t have to be silent, even if she hadn\u2019t turned up on your life you need extra support right now.

I recommend applying as early as possible after it opens for the next school year (usually in October) because some aid is awarded first-come-first-served.", "If *con* be needed, if you end up getting a background check and your school sucks with getting back to them.
