They\u2019re pretty serious, they\u2019ve been dating a couple of months. My mom (46F) passed away a couple of months ago. My dad, since then, now has a new girlfriend. \u201cTammy\u201d. (48F)\n\nFor a while, I felt like an asshole because she hadn\u2019t done anything for me to not like her. My dad and his friends kept getting on me to be nicer, how my mom would want me to like her and to move on, whatever. I didn\u2019t even get a bad vibe from her, I just didn\u2019t like her. But, who boy, did that change. Drastically.\n\nI\u2019m 18, I live at home, I\u2019m currently enrolled in college as a full-time student. Anyway, my dad felt compelled to mention to Tammy that my room could be organized (by her.) Weird, but I didn\u2019t want to say no, at least not in front of my dad. She then decided to, \u201cstart the process\u201d by, starting to attempt to rip the posters and pictures off of my wall. She stopped after I told her to. \n\nThen, oh then, came the contacts. I woke up this morning and unbeknownst to me, she came over earlier to help my dad clean our house. I internally groaned when I woke up and heard her voice, but that\u2019s besides the point. Anyway, I woke up and went to the bathroom to put in my contacts, which are daily pairs, hey\u2019re kept in a little storage box on the back of our toilet. So, I went to grab a pair, and\u2026.nothing was there. Not even the box where they came from, which I need to remember my solution when time comes for ordering more.\n\nI start looking around, in the cabinets, under the sink, even in the trash can in the bathroom. Everything was empty. A horrifying thought came over me. I went into the living room, and asked them if they had moved my contacts. My dad said no, genuinely. Tammy on the other hand, she looked at me, with zero guilt, and said, \u201coh\u2026so that\u2019s what those were?\u201d\n\nPanic sets in. I find out she \u201caccidentally\u201d threw them out last night. I freak out, because I have the worst vision in the world and can\u2019t see clearly 3 feet in front of me without them. So I blow up, to which she responds by saying it was my fault for leaving them out, how if I didn\u2019t want to lose them, I should\u2019ve put them up. I paid for those contacts with the money I got from my mom\u2019s life insurance (it wasn\u2019t a lot). If any of you know shit about contacts, you\u2019ll know they\u2019re expensive. I couldn\u2019t afford to go out and buy a new supply.\n\nMy dad isn\u2019t talking to me now, because he thinks I\u2019m overreacting. He agrees with Tammy, and says if I didn\u2019t want them lost, they should\u2019ve been kept safe. He\u2019s also refusing to buy me a new supply, on her insistence. I asked if he planned to buy me more to compensate for the loss, to which he didn\u2019t say anything at first, but to which Tammy said I needed to learn my lesson and some people have to learn the hard way that not everything in life is free, whatever the hell that means.\n\nSo, TLDR; My dad\u2019s girlfriend totally accidentally threw away my contacts, and then acted like it was my fault.

But it hurts.\n\nThe next time she does that, speak up and ask what kind of person thinks it's okay, even funny to invade someone's room with an unwanted makeover...cue awkward silence.  \n\nDon't back down, tell her that her way of organizing, which is to essentially erase all your personality from your private space, the throw out your contacts is not welcome.   Say it publicly each and every time she talks about it and tell your dad in private that she's embarrassing herself and him and you won't be stomped on anymore.", "It's not stupid. Don't feel bad about wanting to cry over that. Our rooms are our sanctuaries and when everything around you is changing, that is supposed to be your comfort zone.   \nDon't be gaslit into feeling like you're wrong for feeling that way. You are right to have boundaries. She's picking at you and being a bully when your dad should be sticking up for you.", "If you're attached to any of those, you may want to take them down and put them in storage before she destroys them.", "I hate to tell you this but the writing is on the wall. Your father (I'm sorry but he's not a good person or parent) is going to choose Tammy every time. She's in a campaign to get you out. She threw out those contacts on purpose. NTA.", "Get a lock with a key for your room", "If I were at a social event and someone were bitching about/mocking the fact that someone had posters and art on their bedroom walls, it's not the person with the posters I'd be judging.", "The woman is a bully, she looks for vulnerabilities then exploits them.  She knows what she is doing and she's counting on your silence.  You have to speak up for yourself, to your dad and anytime she talks about it public.   And there is nothing wrong with crying about it, your dad should be ashamed of himself.    Use your words next time and every other time she keeps it up.  It will get messy before it gets better; if you don't stand up for yourself though, it will never get better.\n\nAnd when you answer her joke, be sure to mention how your mom just died and this woman is so determined to erase your father's past marriage that she wants to erase you too.   Say it loud and often.", "You're not leaving your mum's grave, she would want you to be safe and happy above everything else.", "Oh this is all so tough. Go as easy on yourself as you can. \n- if your school had a counseling center get an appointment. \n- Ask if they're an accomodations office in case you need extra time for tests and assignments\n- Register at Comfort Zone Camp... they have amazing resources (all free) for kids, teenagers and adults who have lost their moms. Their camps are incredible. https://comfortzonecamp.campintouch.com/ui/forms/client/referral/Form \n- Feel free to take a year off and just grieve and work. If you work for Starbucks during your year off they'll pay for all your online classes at ASU - you can take the classes from anywhere for free.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. It\u2019s quite possible he has some serious issues with managing his grief over your mom, and has kind of gone off the rails a bit. But he\u2019s failing his child here by letting this controlling, unpleasant woman in her life. Some counselling would probably be a big help, if he can be persuaded.", "Well, she is so eager to clean the house, she will surely \"accidently\" throw away every reminder of your mother. \n\nLike she wants to get you out - because you are also a reminder of the mother.", "Hmm condolences for your loss and the wounds might be too fresh to do this, but I have another idea. Buy pro mom posters and hang any pictures you have with your mom up in your room. This way you will always have a connection to your mom and Tammy will have absolute no ground to take down the pro mom posters. It would only make her look like an asshole, even to her friends. It might make her uncomfortable enough to go into your room too.", "\u201cMy mom gave me that poster!\u201d  Sobs!  \u201cWe used to listen to their music together!  Why do you want me to forget my mom?!\u201d", "My best friend + her grandparents, they live very close by. They\u2019ve offered before.", "School always can\u2019t. Or it\u2019ll be harder to start up later. Rn OP might not be paying rent or tuition so it\u2019s a good situation. \n\nI left my moms due to her shoddy behavior like this and three years later I still have struggled to start even community college because I\u2019m paying rent and bills first and it\u2019s hard to find 100% or coverage for classes I won\u2019t always be able to afford via paments", "> Get a rake, kitchen gloves, and do it on the kitchen floor. \n\nAnd leave it there for them to clean up.   Do not back down on this, she will only get worse if you try to appease her.   And tell your dad that getting involved with such a controlling person who would treat you so terribly, especially so soon after your mother's death, makes you think you both need some serious family therapy right now.", "Kitchen or yard, definitely. I wouldn't recommend their bed/bedroom(s), as that kind of crosses a line. \n\nYES BE LOUD. She wants to humiliate you, turn the tables. I know that being loud can feel very uncomfortable, but sometimes it's the best solution.", "Use their bed to dump and sort the trash.", "No.  Tammy should be the one digging through the trash, while OP stands over her with a whip.", "I was going to suggest that as well. Sometimes you have to meet petty with petty.", "When she makes \"jokes\" like that, joke back about how you are surprised she can see the walls considering she can't read the word contacts in large before throwing stuff out. How you wondered if she was trying to depersonalise your room while you couldn't see what she was doing? And when's she's buying the magnolia paint? \n\nHowever, this woman is an immature bully so if you can move anything precious out to safety, get a large lockbox and steel cable tie it to something solid like a radiator. You may have to sacrifice your aesthetic to save your posters. And work to get out if you can.", "Take the offer!", "Have you filled out a FAFSA? You may be eligible for more help than you think.", "Your ability to start school never expires.", "Yard/driveway has the added benefit of potentially making the neighbors ask questions, which OP can answer with the messy, embarrassing truth! Bed/bedroom is the sort of revenge that feels great, but will lose you sympathy from outsiders."]}
