They\u2019re pretty serious, they\u2019ve been dating a couple of months. My mom (46F) passed away a couple of months ago. My dad, since then, now has a new girlfriend. \u201cTammy\u201d. (48F)\n\nFor a while, I felt like an asshole because she hadn\u2019t done anything for me to not like her. My dad and his friends kept getting on me to be nicer, how my mom would want me to like her and to move on, whatever. I didn\u2019t even get a bad vibe from her, I just didn\u2019t like her. But, who boy, did that change. Drastically.\n\nI\u2019m 18, I live at home, I\u2019m currently enrolled in college as a full-time student. Anyway, my dad felt compelled to mention to Tammy that my room could be organized (by her.) Weird, but I didn\u2019t want to say no, at least not in front of my dad. She then decided to, \u201cstart the process\u201d by, starting to attempt to rip the posters and pictures off of my wall. She stopped after I told her to. \n\nThen, oh then, came the contacts. I woke up this morning and unbeknownst to me, she came over earlier to help my dad clean our house. I internally groaned when I woke up and heard her voice, but that\u2019s besides the point. Anyway, I woke up and went to the bathroom to put in my contacts, which are daily pairs, hey\u2019re kept in a little storage box on the back of our toilet. So, I went to grab a pair, and\u2026.nothing was there. Not even the box where they came from, which I need to remember my solution when time comes for ordering more.\n\nI start looking around, in the cabinets, under the sink, even in the trash can in the bathroom. Everything was empty. A horrifying thought came over me. I went into the living room, and asked them if they had moved my contacts. My dad said no, genuinely. Tammy on the other hand, she looked at me, with zero guilt, and said, \u201coh\u2026so that\u2019s what those were?\u201d\n\nPanic sets in. I find out she \u201caccidentally\u201d threw them out last night. I freak out, because I have the worst vision in the world and can\u2019t see clearly 3 feet in front of me without them. So I blow up, to which she responds by saying it was my fault for leaving them out, how if I didn\u2019t want to lose them, I should\u2019ve put them up. I paid for those contacts with the money I got from my mom\u2019s life insurance (it wasn\u2019t a lot). If any of you know shit about contacts, you\u2019ll know they\u2019re expensive. I couldn\u2019t afford to go out and buy a new supply.\n\nMy dad isn\u2019t talking to me now, because he thinks I\u2019m overreacting. He agrees with Tammy, and says if I didn\u2019t want them lost, they should\u2019ve been kept safe. He\u2019s also refusing to buy me a new supply, on her insistence. I asked if he planned to buy me more to compensate for the loss, to which he didn\u2019t say anything at first, but to which Tammy said I needed to learn my lesson and some people have to learn the hard way that not everything in life is free, whatever the hell that means.\n\nSo, TLDR; My dad\u2019s girlfriend totally accidentally threw away my contacts, and then acted like it was my fault.
