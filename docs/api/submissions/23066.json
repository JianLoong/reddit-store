Parenting requires humor and you've got plenty. Glad you put that nosy prejudiced witch in her place.", "Dude you're awesome!

It's well documented that brain development continues up until the mid 20's.  Plus the improvements in career status and financial situation are real too.  So, all else being equal, the average 30 year old absolutely will be a better parent than the average 20 year old, and brain changes are a big part of that.\n\nThis doesn't mean that OP isn't a great parent, of course.  It takes something special to step up and be a dad at that age, especially when the mom is doing the opposite.  The lady was definitely being hostile and TA.  But the biological reality is that human brains do actually change during our 20's, and they change in ways that tend to make us better parents on average.", "I've seen 40 year old children and 15 year old adults.
