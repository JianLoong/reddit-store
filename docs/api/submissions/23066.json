I looked really young and I was on my laptop working on a paper for a college English class and she was so rude about it and literally told me to put it away and to pay attention to what was going on around me. Her words were, \u201cHow do you plan to parent when you can\u2019t even pay attention right now?\u201d At that comment my mom and my ex\u2019s mom were livid and got her out. What a grumpy old woman. I sat there completely baffled. My son was born about 20 hours later. I had time for that English paper.", "I had my baby last year at 24.

Nobody really does. Two of my siblings were teen parents and they did great. Their kids are all adults now, well educated and making great money. Age doesn't matter at all, as long as the effort is there. And in your case, I can tell it is, based on one factor alone: you went to the party. That's some top tier parenting in 2023. Also, all the love and caring you show toward your kid. That too. But I've literally paid my SIL to take my daughter to a classmate's party, and it was because the teacher pointed out to all the parents that no one ever shows up to kids parties like they used to and I felt guilty about it. Lol\n\nA 21 year old dad is no better or worse than a 31 or 41 year old dad. It's all about the effort, and you've got it in the bag!

But we also teach her the value of knowledge and how important it is to try, whether you succeed or not.\n\n The end result is a fine line between being super empathic, or sassy as hell.

The guy replied, \u201chold her tight and never stop telling her you love her because if you don\u2019t someone else will, someone like me.\u201d You\u2019re doing an amazing job.
