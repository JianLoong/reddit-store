Ah, your husband SUCKS for not prioritizing YOUR HEALTH over his lunch with a friend.\n\nFirst, a good partner would care about your well being and chance to address it sooner than later.\n\nSecond, it's flippin lunch. Any decent friend wouldn't think poorly of someone who said, \"hey, I know we have plans but my WIFE has a medical procedure and they changed the date and I need to be with her.\"\n\nThird, WTF is wrong with him that he cares more about what someone else thinks than the woman he is married to? Like, why is he OK being an a\\*\\*hole to YOU and not a friend? \n\nHe sucks, he suck, he sucks. Any decent partner would offer immediately to be your person through this. And I'm sorry he won't show up for you on such a scry day. I hope everything goes well for you.", "NTA\n\nYou need to remind him of the \"in sickness and in health\" part of the wedding vows.\n\nI don't care if he had plans to meet the Pope on that day, your health comes first.\n\nKick him to the kerb and cite Sam in the divorce papers.", "NTA\n\nAlthough your husband did have previously scheduled plans with Sam, if she is truly a good \"friend\" to him, she.wouldnt want to be the reason he couldnt accompany his WIFE to the hospital for a procedure.\n\nBut your husband didnt even consider this possibility before immediately answering and telling you that you knew he had plans with sam that day.   So that strikes me as a big red flag.  Lunches are easily rescheduled unless your husband or sam are frequently out of town.  If they are usually in town, there is NO reason he couldn't called in advance and rescheduled their lunch.\n\nSo that makes me think either\n\n-- it is much more than a lunch ( maybe sex planned at a hotel ) has been planned and it isnt easy to reschedule whatever the other thing(s) were.  \n\n--Or he is looking so forward to spending an hour of time with his ex, that immediately blows off being with you, his WIFE, while you have a procedure and helping you by being available to drive you back.\n\nAnd honestly, either option is not great. The only caveat is if you repeatedly have had some issue arise that is on the same day he has plans with Sam.  But if not, there is a serious issue in your marriage.\n\nYes i think you should calmly, and without blame, talk with him again.  Ask him if there is a reason he didnt offer to reschedule to be able.to take you to the hospital. And then wait for his answer.  If he gets angry or defensive or than a calm caring response, then your understandable question has hit a nerve and you may want to consider getting relationship therapy.", "NTA and his relationship with Sam sounds suspicious as hell.", "NTA.

And I would expect her to be pissed if I did the same to her. \n\nWe are allowed to have our own lives and friends outside of marriage but at the end of the day my wife comes first and I am sure I come first to her (except maybe second behind our dogs \ud83d\ude02)", "NTA.

Then, luck has it there is an opening this month and it actually fits in better with your husband's schedule.\n\nBut your husband can't help because he has a lunch date with his ex and that is his priority.\n\nTake the appointment that is sooner and ask on social media if anyone is able to help drop you off and pick you up from this very important appointment.

Being there to support your partner during a hospital procedure is more important than lunch with anyone! He's showing who is most important to him and he's making himself out to be a victim by saying you knew he had plans so now he has this difficult (it should be easy) choice to make. He's also blaming you with the comment about knowing he had plans for a while, as if you chose to have your appointment on the same day, when you got a chance for your procedure to be done about 2 month earlier. This is very emotionally manipulative of him. So he wants you to have another 2 months of nervously waiting for a procedure you're worried about so he can have lunch with his ex, an ex who isn't even nice to you?! Are you kidding me? I'm so sorry you're being treated that way, that's really wrong\n\nI see others in the comments are suspicious about his relationship with his ex, as am I. But even if they aren't sleeping together, he's putting \"lunch\" higher on his priorities list than your feelings and being there for you to help, comfort and look out for you. I hope your procedure goes well and you can decide on what's best for you with regards to your relationship. I wish you much health and happiness for the future", "I'm so sorry.
