At least family medicine \u2014 it\u2019s only 3 years which is bearable even if it\u2019s crappy and you have a lot of flexibility in your eventual practice. I don\u2019t think that anyone would hire someone who has completed med school but didn\u2019t finish some kind of residency training", "This made me guffaw like an old man.", "I would hope OP would have gone to graduation or seen pictures!", "This is, unfortunately, the correct answer. Someone has been living a lie for a substantial period of time.", "You can totally quit a residency!   It's not super common, but after how grueling medical school is, the horridness of residency can become unbearable! People usually stick it out if they can, obviously,  because without residency you don't start to earn what people think of as a full doctor salary.\n\nMy dear friend quit a residency after a year for medical/ personal reasons, took a year to get their ducks in a row, then transferred to a new program that someone else had dropped out of mid year (the year starts in the fall). It happens.\n\nHOWEVER,  this dude sounds untrustworthy and I'd leave without seeing proof too.  He's probably an exotic dancer and that's day he won't show his paystubs or something!", "Nope. Both of these are extremely limited. \nCredit checks for the most part contain no employment records. \nBackground check might but also the information gained is limited. \nNeither will contain salary info.", "No it isn\u2019t. She\u2019s asking. And they\u2019re planning to get married. Even if they weren\u2019t engaged, there\u2019s no invasion if she\u2019s asking.", "So what would be a better way for OP to have acted on the maybe-red flags described in the post?", "Oh. I\u2019m not blaming HER for the lack of trust.  I\u2019m saying if she\u2019s distrusting him this much now, can he really gain that back. Even if he is working right now, will she still wonder about other things in the future.", "Residency starts July 1st in the US. It is incredibly rare that a residency will have someone leave or fire them. It\u2019s even less common that someone will find a new spot that allows them to continue in their current year of training rather than restarting their residency. To put it bluntly, the potential new residency doesn\u2019t want someone else\u2019s problem child. \n\nMy husband is an assistant director of a residency program. We are limited by the ACGME to a set number of residents per year and have incredibly stringent requirements for letting them go. Literally they have to be so incompetent that we worry they will kill someone for an extended time with massive amounts of documentation and remediation before it\u2019s an option. And even then they agonize over the decision because it can ruin someone\u2019s career.", "Yeah, I went straight to \"exotic dancer\" too.  Must be all the dollar bills stuffed in his pants when he gets home.  Crazy eh?", "As I said, I feel like this is one of those that\u2019s more nuanced than someone just being a blatant AH.\n\nThere\u2019s no trust here. If you need to ask for pay stubs, you\u2019ve probably missed 100 red flags before that.\n\nIf the they OP gets pay stubs and they check out, it ultimately doesn\u2019t matter. Something else will come up cos of the lack of trust. (I don\u2019t think we know enough from this story to understand the lack of trust, what caused it, if it\u2019s justified etc)", "I think this is one of those posts that isn\u2019t about what it\u2019s about.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about pay stubs or privacy, it\u2019s about trust.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that lack of trust is warranted or not from what we\u2019re told. But I think you\u2019re being too literal if you think it\u2019s about privacy.", "Impossible to say without knowing what\u2019s led to the obvious lack of trust between them.", "A tiny, silly, little part of me giggled at the idea of killing someone for a short period of time, and how that might be okay", "I\u2019m so curious about which program he claimed he was in previously and which program he said he\u2019s going into. With the name of the specialty, it would be very easy to check to see if his dates match up.", "That\u2019s once they become an attending! The time you worry goes down, but their ability stays the same!"]}
