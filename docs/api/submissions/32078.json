I was very excited to go, however a girl I was seeing ended up pregnant (we were not together, but were exclusive). Of course I didn't want a baby with my fwb, and also it would ruin my opportunity to go to Japan. \n\nI begged her to have an abortion, since why would any of us want that baby? We were definitely not committed to each other. We had discussed abortions before (as many other subjects), so I knew that she didn't have a problem with abortions. However, she decided that she was going to keep the baby. I told her that honestly I didn't want to be a father, but that I'll wait until the baby's birth because maybe I'll feel different then. I didn't change my mind when the baby was born. So we agreed that I wouldn't be an active father, but I'll fullfil all of my responsibilities. \n\nI had to cancel my trip to Japan to get a better job so I could pay child support. Thankfully my parents also helped me so I moved in with them, I almost had to drop out of college but thankfully I was able to graduate. I still wanted to go to Japan, so when one of my ex classmates moved in there to work I asked him to let me know if there was any vacancy at his company. I got a job there and moved in October 2019. \n\nEver since, I couldn't come back to America, because of COVID and also because the rhythm of work there is harder, so I was always working and trying to advance in my career. Of course I continued sending the money for my son. \n\nWell, the thing is that I have vacation now and I travelled for Thanksgiving. I got here the week prior to thanksgiving and my parents prepared a \"welcome party\" with our family and friends. They apparently got very close to my son when I was not here and they invited him and his mother. To be honest I don't have any problems with them, but we don't have a close relationship either. \n\nWhen I went to the backyard (where the guest were) I greeted them both, but I was feeling awkward and we didn't talk much. When everyone left my parents told me off because they expected me to be way happier about seeing my son. We got into a bit of an argument and now my mother and father are upset at me for being so cold? I don't understand why they expected me to be happier, I don't know my son too much, he wasn't very excited to see me either. But it's been far too long and they're still upset, si I need some outsider pov since my friends are agreeing with me, but they might be doing it just to not argue with me.\n\n\nEdit: I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was not clear in the post. But I didn't kick my son or his mom out of the party, they stayed till the end. I greeted them, I asked him about his school and his martial arts classes and he told me he's doing fine, so I congratulated him. His mother hasn't texted me at all to tell me that the kid's sad after seeing me.

Looks OP'S parents expected OP'S to have changed after being away so long. And are angry that they haven't. Lots of commenters are saying OP is awful for not being an involved parent. It sounds if OP was an involved parent it would be an absolutely insane idea. Who possibly thinks a relationship with a parent who doesn't want the child is a good idea? He pays child support and his ex has full custody. My views on adoption. I agree that adoptees should be told as early as possible probably about 2ish. But I will NOT agree that open adoption is the best option for all concerned. Because that can be messy.
