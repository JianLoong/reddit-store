I was very excited to go, however a girl I was seeing ended up pregnant (we were not together, but were exclusive). Of course I didn't want a baby with my fwb, and also it would ruin my opportunity to go to Japan. \n\nI begged her to have an abortion, since why would any of us want that baby? We were definitely not committed to each other. We had discussed abortions before (as many other subjects), so I knew that she didn't have a problem with abortions. However, she decided that she was going to keep the baby. I told her that honestly I didn't want to be a father, but that I'll wait until the baby's birth because maybe I'll feel different then. I didn't change my mind when the baby was born. So we agreed that I wouldn't be an active father, but I'll fullfil all of my responsibilities. \n\nI had to cancel my trip to Japan to get a better job so I could pay child support. Thankfully my parents also helped me so I moved in with them, I almost had to drop out of college but thankfully I was able to graduate. I still wanted to go to Japan, so when one of my ex classmates moved in there to work I asked him to let me know if there was any vacancy at his company. I got a job there and moved in October 2019. \n\nEver since, I couldn't come back to America, because of COVID and also because the rhythm of work there is harder, so I was always working and trying to advance in my career. Of course I continued sending the money for my son. \n\nWell, the thing is that I have vacation now and I travelled for Thanksgiving. I got here the week prior to thanksgiving and my parents prepared a \"welcome party\" with our family and friends. They apparently got very close to my son when I was not here and they invited him and his mother. To be honest I don't have any problems with them, but we don't have a close relationship either. \n\nWhen I went to the backyard (where the guest were) I greeted them both, but I was feeling awkward and we didn't talk much. When everyone left my parents told me off because they expected me to be way happier about seeing my son. We got into a bit of an argument and now my mother and father are upset at me for being so cold? I don't understand why they expected me to be happier, I don't know my son too much, he wasn't very excited to see me either. But it's been far too long and they're still upset, si I need some outsider pov since my friends are agreeing with me, but they might be doing it just to not argue with me.\n\n\nEdit: I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was not clear in the post. But I didn't kick my son or his mom out of the party, they stayed till the end. I greeted them, I asked him about his school and his martial arts classes and he told me he's doing fine, so I congratulated him. His mother hasn't texted me at all to tell me that the kid's sad after seeing me.

Looks OP'S parents expected OP'S to have changed after being away so long. And are angry that they haven't. Lots of commenters are saying OP is awful for not being an involved parent.

He pays child support and his ex has full custody. My views on adoption. I agree that adoptees should be told as early as possible probably about 2ish.

You're in another country to him so regular visitation isn't going to happen.  My thoughts are that you become like an uncle to him.  You can still be a mentor and guide him.

Most likely in his mid teens where he's trying to work out who he is... so be mindful of that.\n\nMaintaining some sort of contact and being on the same page as his mother over this (you both tell him the same age appropriate story as he gets older) will go a long way to helping his mental health as he navigates his adolescence.\n\nAlthough I can see where you coming from, you will still be judged harshly by others for what you are doing to your child.

Plus based on what OP said, his son wasn't all that excited to meet him either, so if the kid  who's the only party that matter here, doesn't care nor is excited to meet OP, why should everyone else care so much especially since OP has stated he's fine with the fact his son doesn't see him as a father nor wants to get to know him", "> you will never get those years back. Watching a child grow up and give you the unconditional love they give is something that can never be replaced.\n\n If that's something you WANT, then sure. But not everyone wants that. I could say there's joy to be had from hatching snakes or tarantulas and raising them yourself. Or there's a thrill in going caving. And all the time you spent not doing those things is time you missed out, that can't be replaced, and you will never get back. But if those aren't things you want to do or find value in, then no, you haven't really \"missed out\" l, have you?\n\nYOU find value in raising a child. Lots of people do. That doesn't mean everyone does. OP was clear from the start that he didn't want a kid. The only reason he waited to see the kid born was because of the myth so many parents perpetuate that there's some magical parent instinct that always automatically kicks in and makes you maternal/paternal. It didn't for OP, and he fulfilled his legal responsibility and more.\n\nHis parents sprung a reunion on him and he was cordial. He didn't treat the kid poorly. He just didn't have a Hallmark moment when he suddenly metamorphosed into Norman Rockwell painting, which is what his parents wanted. He's doing the thing he wants to do with his time instead of the thing they (and you) want him to do with it. I suspect that if OP gave up his career and goals to come back home and play house, THAT would be the real case of \"time he doesn't get back\" for him. And really, is that better for the kid? To have to be around a parent who's just there out of obligation instead of genuine desire?", "[deleted]", "Girl, I agree 100%.

You\u2019re doing just fine. It\u2019d be worse if you were in & out of his life and making promising you don\u2019t keep. You pay child support, which is more than a lot of other biological fathers. No one should judge you or make you feel bad for being indifferent to your son. Would it be great if you wanted to be involved/love him? Yeah, but you can\u2019t fake feelings. It would just make you (and him) resentful down the line.", "Dude, you can have your minions  (willing to follow you to the pit of hell) downvote my comments as much as you want.  Their votes will not change the fact that you are not a decent human being.", "He is legally obligated to pay child support. He changed his lifestyle and canceled the trip to pay that child support. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say he gave up anything but was forced to adapt in fear of legal repercussions.", "Yeah I don\u2019t understand, as a pro choice woman myself, why men don\u2019t have the same choice. \n\nShe chose to keep the baby knowing he wasn\u2019t ready, that is fine.

Most of my friends have families with multiple kids. I think it\u2019s pretty common that parents are nervous, don\u2019t feel ready, and have doubts about all the sacrifices they are going to have to make to raise the kids. Would be Pretty shitty of them to have abandoned their partners and kids for those reasons.", "Why is he an asshole if you agree being honest and friendly towards the kid is a decent outcome that won\u2019t fuck the kid up? I\u2019m not trying to be rude. I say that cause I\u2019m reading that first sentence and it sounds really aggressive. I just want to know what about OPs behavior puts him over the line to AH territory for you.", "I think they use it as a last resort because it\u2019s counter productive to paying child support. Googled it and it said felony up to years in prison. \n\nAlso if you have a felony that pretty much gives any country a reason to deny you access or kick you out. I mean you can\u2019t even get into Canada if you have a felony.", "Literally 100% agree. Being raised by a parent who is being forced to raise you sounds like it would be emotionally devastating for the rest of your life and force you to rely on stellar therapists forever. Without therapy that just sounds like it would result in a shit person, either emotionally a wreck, or something far worse. That\u2019s some Truman show level psychological damage.", "Agreed.

It's not normal to disrupt a child's life like that and you wouldn't see any family training their children to know other people like that, just because it's the bio parents it's not reason enough, it needs to be a desition they make when they are older and understand. And that starts with explaining them how they are family and how that happened. I see a lot of people making the mistake of not talking about the adoption or the details (age appropriately) and that's another disservice.", "Okay, thanks.", "Minions lol.

Being in an exclusive relationship with a women and getting her pregnant. Then trying to force her to have an abortion under threat of being a single mom. \n\n2. Not stepping up once the child is born and going complete no contact. Again his right to do but objectively AH behavior. \n\n3. Parents are completely wrong for surprising him but once he is face to face with his son not putting any effort in. The son is only 8 years old and innocent in all this. The least OP could do was have a conversation or show interest even if he is faking it for a couple hours. Most adults have to have too many conversations like this just in their daily lives. Or when they talk to their friends kids or nieces/nephews. It\u2019s not hard to put in a little effort since his son was already at the party and came with the knowledge of meeting his father. Again OP can act and do what he wants but objectively ignoring them is AH behavior.", "NTA", "And they\u2019re hoping that you\u2019ll follow suit. It\u2019s not unreasonable.", "Okay bud.", "Shoulda worn a condom.", "1. Assuming he doesn\u2019t want to raise the kid. What should he have done then?\n\n2. What do you define as stepping up when the child is born? He has said he contacts the mom so I assume you mean no contact with the kid.\n\n3. Do you consider talking to the kid about his school, his martial arts classes, greeting the kid, and congratulating him on his accomplishment putting effort in? I have two more questions regarding this part. How long should he have talked to the child for to make you feel OP is not an asshole? If you as an 8 year old met a dude who people say is your father do you think things would awkward?\n\nI ask the last question cause I imagine a large reason for the brevity of the conversation is due to the awkwardness of the situation. You\u2019re right adults engage in small talk all the time. But this is a monumental amount of discomfort for both OP and the child. I genuinely can\u2019t stress the child part enough though. That kid\u2019s mind must be really working overtime in that encounter. I would love to be convinced otherwise, but an 8 year old does not want to have an hour plus long conversation with some dude he just met who people say is his father unless he\u2019s been given a seriously good therapist and months of preparation time. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an eight year old hold an hour long conversation with a stranger, let alone in this indescribably alien moment for both participants. \n\nThank you for engaging me in this conversation.

I talked to her and told her that we weren't even dating, so there was no way we could be a stable family. We were both in college too, I had plans to go to Japan. We both had shitty jobs and we guessed that she would have to quit/ would be fired (it was the latter). So a kid was literally the worst thing that could happen.
