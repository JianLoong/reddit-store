We split February 2020, he hasn't physically seen her since June 2020. In the beginning I asked him to call and tried to set up schedules. I also sent updates and photos about her but all he would say was \"thanks\" and he never really asked anything about her so after about a year I stopped wasting my time. I have court ordered child support but he hasn't paid since March 2023. In 2022 he called her 8 times for a total of 4 hours and this year (2023) he's called 3 times for a total of 2 hours (one of these was a 13 minute call last night at 730 but R said she was tired and ready to go to bed and was ready to say bye). So on to the issue, two days ago Nick asked me for Rs ss number and after a couple questions he said it was for the medical insurance he's supposed to have on her and I asked for proof such as a photo of the forms since it was suspicious that he suddenly wants to get the insurance on her when he's not paid support. He argued with me for 4 hours and never asked about R, which I pointed out in the end. He did eventually send me a photo of the forms and I gave him the number but it really felt like giving her ss number to a stranger. Now since I repeatedly pointed out that he doesn't try to talk to her, he suddenly wants to call and that's great except I've refused because he is being ridiculous. He is now claiming he wants to talk to her everyday at 7:30 which doesn't work for my family as R goes to bed at 7 because she's in school. Nick claims to work everyday (7 days a week but the photo of his paperwork says he works 40 hours a week) and this is the only time he can call. I told him absolutely not and offered that he could call every Friday at that time and on Saturday and Sunday before he has to go to work because Saturday is our \"family time\" and sunday is technically a school night but he says that's not good enough and I have too work around his schedule (the only court order we have is child support) and that he can't call on the weekend before work because he has to get up \"at the ass Crack of dawn\" and doesn't get home til 7:30. I told him this was what I was offering and if he could consistently call he could see about more days but that I refuse to turn my family's lives upside down.

I get the impression that these calls are a way of controlling you, not a real desire for him to reconnect with his child.  \n\nIf he really cared about her, he'd make an effort to adapt to her schedule. Parents make an effort to organize their time and actually __see__ their children, but he can't spare 5 minutes for a phone call ?\n\nBesides, your daughter's well-being comes first. She doesn't need that call every day, it's a chore for her. Stick to your proposal and let him grumble, 3 calls a week with a stranger are more than enough for your daughter.\n\nIf he wants to have a relationship with her, he should see her, play with her and give her a few presents. Kids don't get attached with phone calls.", "NTA, but clearly you need a return trip to Family Court to establish the rules around visitation and contact.  Otherwise he may try to  position your refusals as the beginning of \"parental alienation.\"", "NTA\n\nIf you are in US, make sure you file your taxes before him - with that SS#, he can file with her as dependent and screw your taxes up...", "You may need to verify this, but I am pretty sure if he isn't paying child support than he doesn't have any rights to her. Also, given how little he has contacted her or been her life, any family court would make him abide by the schedule you have set for her. Especially given the fact that he wants to disrupt her bedtime sched5 and things like that. So really, you could enforce the exact days and times he can call her if you wanted to. \n\nAnd you are clearly NTA. It is really suspicious he all of a sudden wants her SSN and this contact with her. I would make sure to keep an eye on her information to make sure he doesn't try to use it for other things, like claiming her on his taxes or another financial benefit of some sort or even for credit fraud or something like that. I have seen horror stories of kids turning 18 and their credit already being completely ruined because a relative used their SSN for various things. I don't know how it possible, but it is.", "If you are in the states and gave him her ss#, be very careful.  He may try to claim her on his taxes.", "NTA.  He\u2019s going to try to claim her as a dependent on his taxes and/or take out credit in her name.  Please freeze her credit with the credit agencies and speak to an attorney about locking down the tax issue.", "Until March it was garnished but he got a new job in March and didn't report to his caseworker and until yesterday I didn't know what his new job was. But now that I know where he works I just have to talk to my caseworker so they could get that going.", "Yes and no. As a split father, it can be challenging to adhere to an exes time table, due to work. I've been there. But him refusing to call on other days or times or trying to actively compromise also feels more like a power trip/self creating victim card to me. If he wants to demand that voice call time frame, tell him to go to court and you'll explain it to the judge why you've been declining. Odds are, the judge will tell your ex to work his breaks around a schedule for you.", "I wouldn't have given him her Social Security number he can use it for claiming taxes", "NTA even if you are split coparenting is about making compromises which you clearly offered", "Did he give a reason for why he\u2019s working so much that he has very limited times he can talk, but yet can\u2019t pay any child support??", "NTA. Are you sure he isn't filing her as a dependent on taxes? He would need her ss number for that. I would have asked for the companies contact info and given it directly to them.", "NAH\n\nStanding up for your daughter does not require putting up with an unreasonable demand from her father. It also does not require standing in the way of efforts to build or sustain a relationship. It is a difficult tightrope to walk.\n\n1. It is 100% normal to have to provide specific identifying information about a child to put them on your heath insurance. Exact details may vary. A birth certificate and social security number is what my employers required of me.  Do not assume he is asking in bad faith. Trust, but verify.\n2. Acknowledge what he is saying about wanting to build regular contact and do your best to engage in a process that recognizes your daughter's needs first. Say something like \"Since she is only 4 years old she has an early bedtime at 7. We could arrange regular calls that end before that time. You could even read her a bedtime story.\"\n3. Be mindful that as your daughter grows older the time will come when she can choose to establish, maintain, or cut off relationships with her father. If her perception at that time is that you actively impeded a relationship that she feels she wanted then she may blame you. Be cautious.", "NTA - he may be trying to claim her as a dependent on taxes that he can do if he is paying child support but if he\u2019s not then he cannot, so that\u2019s possibly what\u2019s going on here. There is a possibility that he is getting her medical insurance as he may have a good deal through work to add on a dependent and yes he would need R\u2019s Social Security number but then you should be getting the insurance cards to use so that should be pretty clear if that\u2019s what he\u2019s actually doing. \n\nAs to setting times to talk to her, he should totally take into account her bedtime as she is so young and could call on break or lunch or something like that. To only want to call super late at night is very odd. I don\u2019t know anyone who works seven days a week, unless they do seven on, seven off, or maybe on an oil rig or fishing, his story is a bit suspect. Him calling at 7:30 on Friday and Saturday night seem reasonable, he should be jumping on that opportunity for a start.", "NTA go get your child support! Maybe talk to a lawyer about setting up a reasonable window that he can call (like from 5-7 pm Monday - Friday and  3-7 pm Saturday & Sunday? ) \n\nI would see if you could have all contact go through a lawyer, have a prepaid special daddy phone and turn it off or put it on silent except for his times to call\u2026, then change your phone number. Only give him the daddy phone number.  If he ever yells at you again hang up and turn off your phone. Don\u2019t put up with it.", "NTA\n\nUntil he pays child support, he gets no contact. That's how it works. He pays, and he gets contact. He doesn't pay? He gets nothing. But you should go back to court to get his paycheck garnished. Your daughter deserves that money.\n\nAlso, lock down your daughter's credit. Just in case. And make sure you file your taxes with her as a dependent almost as soon as you can. He's almost certainly going to try and claim her on his taxes, and the IRS are very slow to investigate and put that right. Even if its provably tax fraud, it will cause you a *lot* of problems, take months to fix, and might screw up your taxes for years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
