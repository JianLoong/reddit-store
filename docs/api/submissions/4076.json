I like to think many people feel this way about their homes. It\u2019s your private space to feel, look, and do as you please without interference from random strangers.

My husband and I had just gotten home from work (we carpooled) and we had \u201crelations\u201d in our kitchen- we lived in an apt and it opened to a hallway right by the front door. Sue me we were newly married. Afterwards I went to the bedroom for comfy clothes and my husband was cleaning up (still naked btw) and the front door opened up and a workman came in and was like \u201cWTF dude you said I could just walk in. I\u2019m not into that.\u201d My husband the most non-confrontational man you will ever meet said \u201cNeither am I but you need to get the f**k out of my place before I call the cops.\u201d There was a bit of back and forth- reminder here my husband is still naked talking/yelling at this man. Come to find out we wanted the apt above ours. The person above us came down and apologized. The guy was new and they told him to just walk in as they were having lots of work done to their apt. We never made the mistake again to not lock the door once we got in.", "NTA, she was basically trespassing", "The lady got quite irritated to be thrown out.", "I will be next time. I'm not a fearful person but this was annoying. She had the audacity to judge my getup in my own house!", "I just looked it up and we have a version of it, too.", "And potentially life-ending.  Not a smart thing to do.", "Lol, I thought so, too. And why didn't she call the person - be it realtor or seller - that told her about the viewing? I've been to viewings and if I would've been unsure about the location I wouldn't just enter random houses. This is not an apartment complex where people wandering in wouldn't be so odd and you can't mistake it for one.", "Lol\u2026 Years ago a family friend had walked right into a neighbors house before realizing it was the wrong house. To be fair, we were expecting them to just come in AND on our road, there are 3 of our house design in a row (just different colors).", "She wrapped herself in a blanket", "I have a the gut feeling that she didn't scope out the house. Of course I can't be sure, but there are other less obvious ways to do so. \n\nIt is weird indeed. I checked several websites and absolutely nothing is listed that would even remotely look like my house. If she got a tip for something not listed (yet) she should've asked that person for better info instead of just walking into a house.", "We usually don't as it's never been an issue. There's always someone home anyways, including a dog.\n\nEdit: it's not very dangerous were I live. Guns are heavily regulated. I don't know a single person that has a permit, let alone weapons at home or is even allowed to carry them.", "Guns are very regulated in my country. Very few people have one. But I was thinking about calling the police. I have the gut feeling that she was just a somewhat dim person, but harmless.", "It was my favorite ugly blanket, though!", "I try to be polite and probably worry too much about other people's feelings. I was very conflicted about feeling angry about her entering and me being harsh with her. I hope someone puts her behavior into context when she retells what happened.", "I dismissed this a few times because my gut feeling told me otherwise but I've called the non-emergency police number a moment ago. Mistakes happen but a few things don't add up. I thought because she didn't leave immediately upon hearing sounds or me shouting \"not a good time\", then knocking wouldn't be something someone like that would do. \n\nThe officer thought that it was weird as well and wrote down the description of her.", "She had a lot of audacity to join someone's yard and knock the door", "Yeah the days of being offered a cuppa when you enter a random house are gone. This lady is why folks lock their doors now. NTA", "And I assume your family friend apologized about entering the wrong house and not be all judgmental about it. Accidents can happen, it is all about how we responds about when it happens to us.\n\nIf your story happened to me and the person would apologized, I would have a good laugh about it with my neighbor.", "Yea I know", "A couple college students were stabbed to death in their house in Idaho pretty recently. Apparently that was a safe and quiet town too.", "Yea that's how all unfortunate incidents are. You never get hit by a car, mugged, unlawfully arrested, betrayed, scammed, or anything until you do. Locking a door is like looking before you cross the road. It should be ingrained into you and should be a reflex every you close the door.", "That's good. People can die for being this dim where I live", "Also, lock your front door when you're in to stop random asshole's entering!", "She had to open a gate, too. lol She also definitely didn't ring the bell. Maybe she turned the light on and off on the gate. That happens sometimes.", "Ya know, it was like, 12 years ago. I can\u2019t remember. But it was either they apologized or the homeowners weren\u2019t within earshot lol.", "It was my favorite ugly blanket. I wanted to show it off.", "Be cautious.   Though she might've come across as a fool, she instead might've been scoping out your property for a break in or theft.", "I thought about this, too. I checked the house and yard if something went missing. I will be extra vigilant from now on.", "NTA. But lock your doors.", "Lock your damn door.", "NTA.", "Lock your door", "NTA. You have no obligation to be polite to a nuisance. When apartments are being shown there's always contact information. Lazy idiot should have dialed her phone.", "NTA, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe, but make sure your doors are always locked!", "NTA. Of course she got irritated, she had the audacity to come in in thirst place so she clearly has no social boundaries. Doesn't make her right, but I'm not shocked that her reaction to not being welcomed in a home she basically invaded was annoyance.", "Sorry, for clarification: which door was she knocking on? One inside the house?", "NTA here. She would've been met with a show of force at my house. I give you credit for handling it the way you did.\n\nFuture note to self: Always keep your doors locked nowadays, nowhere is safe. She could've been scouting for a potential robbery or a more nefarious action.", "NTA - I had a friend who would say \u201cIf you want to see the newest gun in my collection, walk into my house unexpected. \u201c", "[removed]", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m not sure where you live, but where I live (Georgia, USA), she could have gotten herself shot. \n\nHer behavior could have put herself in serious danger.", "NTA", "NTA start locking your door specially when your home alone!", "That doesn't work too well in Florida,  and usually ends with a news story. \n\n\"Florida Man shoots little old lady...\"", "NTA but I'm confused if she was actually in your house or not? Like she's in, but also outside knocking on the front door?", "Nta but lock your front door perhaps..", "How did she get inside your house?\nThat\u2019s scary.\nYou are NTA but please start locking the door.\nShe might return.", "NTA\nThat\u2019s just weird", "So, you're NTA for how you handled this, but you're also Murphy's Lawing yourself by leaving your door unlocked.", "Oh gosh, yes. Doors will be locked. This rattled the other people living in the house to not do this again.", "Hey, please be kind. It was like that for decades without issue and we got used to it. Part of that wasn't my decision. That doesn't mean we won't change that. This rattled the others in the house that would insist on not locking the door.", "Won't happen again, that's for sure!", "Yep, inside. After entering the front door. She had to open a gate, enter the house and the she was in front of my door.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

In some neighborhoods that leads to shoot first ask questions later.", "Just lock your door if you don't wanna be judged lol", "So if there were no nearby listing for an apartment or home showing in your area then she was most likely scoping out the place for nefarious reasons. It sucks being suspicious of everyone, but the world has always been a dangerous place. We just hear about it more with advancement of technology. Lock your doors. It's simple and doesn't take any additional time out of your day to do it.", "richard chase murdered families and he chose them based on whether their door was unlocked or not. he put a baby in a blender and injected it into his body to stop what he called \"soap dish poisoning\"\nlock your doors.", "Good work! I am also glad that you are safe! \nI was reminded of this reading your account. I had just moved into my apartment which is downtown in my city I fell asleep on my couch and woke up and there was a guy I didn\u2019t know sitting on my coffee table looking at me. I freaked out on him. Turns out he was on again off again with the girl that used to live there. He didn\u2019t know that she had moved and for some reason the fact that all the furnishings in the apartment were different didn\u2019t phase him. I thought that I had left my door unlocked by mistake but I discovered he had a key which he refused to give back. Management had not bothered to change the locks after she left. That was rectified quickly.", "This is like saying \"I drove for years without a seatbelt on and was fine, its only this one time I got in a car accident that it ended up being a problem for me and my spine.\"", "U wanna be a statistic so bad lol", "What the actual fuck. NTA for sure.", "And serial killers.", "It was just peculiar. And I want to make sassy remark.", "I feel like it's really weird to get on someone like that for not remembering to lock their door, it's not like an unlocked door is some kinda invitation lol", "Can I come and judge you, too?\n\nEdit: I guess not? Some of you act as if you never make mistakes. I know leaving the door open was a mistake. Maybe a dozen has (rightfully) called me out on it. Neither of them did so by being rude.", "When I first posted I thought it was an annoying but genuine mistake. I have called the police in the meantime and gave them her description.", "I grew up in the kind of town where nobody ever locks their doors. My family still don't. This is really a cultural thing dependent on where it is. I never even had a housekey until I moved to the city.", "Please look at the other replies as well. I know that I have to lock the doors. This was a mistake and one that I will not make again.", "A huge reminder that people can be very weird. Wow. I would've been horrified. I'm glad he was seemingly just odd.", "No, it would be \"I was fine for years and that's why I did it. I had an accident and that's why I'll stop doing it.\" I wasn't trying to justify what we did. Just saying that we did because we felt too safe. It was definitely a mistake and we got lucky so far.", "What? I do want to lock the door. Other family members didn't want to.", "My college was in a town like that. Blew my mind, coming from a large city where I reflexively auto lock even the car doors whenever I stop at a light (never noticed until a friend pointed it out)", "thank u i just want you and your family to be safe. there are wolves at the door and we do what we can to keep them out. if your family members still do not want it, make it the hill you die on.", "In your defence, I grew up in a city where people never locked their doors until bedtime. This is still quite common for my family members. I think you learned the hard way to now start locking your doors, but I can see why you weren\u2019t necessarily doing it in the first place. I\u2019m also reminded of some Michael Moore doc (it may have been Bowling for Columbine) where he went to Canada and just started opening doors because people weren\u2019t locking them.", "Girl just lock your doors and the chance of this ever happening goes down exponentially. It seems you\u2019re more upset for being judged for your attire than over some stranger barging into your home. \n\nNTA for kicking a stranger out of your house but come on. Even the \u2018quiet\u2019 neighborhoods aren\u2019t 100% safe.", "Thank you for being so nice about it. People have rightfully told me that this was a mistake. Some are not being nice about it. I can accept criticism. But I don't like be slammed for it. The other family members have been rattled by this enough to not leave the door open anymore.", "Thank you for being so understanding. That's exactly why we did it. I got quite lucky as nothing  too bad happened. But it was a hard lesson indeed. Doors will be locked from now on. \n\n(It was Bowling for Columbine, I think. I'll have to rewatch it.)", "I was trying to be funny and I didn't see the danger in it at first. The more I thought about it and with more comments coming in that she was probably scoping me out changed my perspective on it. \n\nI know that statisticly speaking no place on earth inhabited by humans is safe, but I felt safe enough to not care about an unlocked door.
