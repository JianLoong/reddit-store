Sounds like she was planning on robbing you and realized you were home, or scoping it out for future as to who lives there, is there a dog etc\u2026.weird.", "NTA, and also that could be dangerous there\u2019s a lot of evil in this world", "I live out in the boonies (can barely see neighboring houses) and rarely get people coming up to my house unless it's for delivery and I always lock my doors.

Why didn\u2019t you lock the door though?", "NTA it's your home", "[removed]", "Absolutely NTA. Things like soliciting really trigger me and strangers approaching me for no reason also triggers me. I have a lot of trauma. My home is my safe space and when strangers come uninvited, it makes me feel like I can\u2019t be safe in my own home. I like to think many people feel this way about their homes. It\u2019s your private space to feel, look, and do as you please without interference from random strangers. Honestly you handled the situation better than I would have. It might be worth making sure you always lock all your doors so people cannot enter your home unannounced again. Stay safe.", "NTA.

My husband and I had just gotten home from work (we carpooled) and we had \u201crelations\u201d in our kitchen- we lived in an apt and it opened to a hallway right by the front door. Sue me we were newly married. Afterwards I went to the bedroom for comfy clothes and my husband was cleaning up (still naked btw) and the front door opened up and a workman came in and was like \u201cWTF dude you said I could just walk in. I\u2019m not into that.\u201d My husband the most non-confrontational man you will ever meet said \u201cNeither am I but you need to get the f**k out of my place before I call the cops.\u201d There was a bit of back and forth- reminder here my husband is still naked talking/yelling at this man. Come to find out we wanted the apt above ours. The person above us came down and apologized. The guy was new and they told him to just walk in as they were having lots of work done to their apt. We never made the mistake again to not lock the door once we got in.", "NTA, she was basically trespassing", "The lady got quite irritated to be thrown out.", "I will be next time. I'm not a fearful person but this was annoying. She had the audacity to judge my getup in my own house!", "I just looked it up and we have a version of it, too.", "And potentially life-ending.  Not a smart thing to do.", "Lol, I thought so, too. And why didn't she call the person - be it realtor or seller - that told her about the viewing? I've been to viewings and if I would've been unsure about the location I wouldn't just enter random houses. This is not an apartment complex where people wandering in wouldn't be so odd and you can't mistake it for one.", "Lol\u2026 Years ago a family friend had walked right into a neighbors house before realizing it was the wrong house. To be fair, we were expecting them to just come in AND on our road, there are 3 of our house design in a row (just different colors).", "She wrapped herself in a blanket", "I have a the gut feeling that she didn't scope out the house. Of course I can't be sure, but there are other less obvious ways to do so. \n\nIt is weird indeed. I checked several websites and absolutely nothing is listed that would even remotely look like my house. If she got a tip for something not listed (yet) she should've asked that person for better info instead of just walking into a house.", "We usually don't as it's never been an issue. There's always someone home anyways, including a dog.\n\nEdit: it's not very dangerous were I live. Guns are heavily regulated. I don't know a single person that has a permit, let alone weapons at home or is even allowed to carry them.", "Guns are very regulated in my country. Very few people have one. But I was thinking about calling the police. I have the gut feeling that she was just a somewhat dim person, but harmless.", "It was my favorite ugly blanket, though!", "I try to be polite and probably worry too much about other people's feelings. I was very conflicted about feeling angry about her entering and me being harsh with her. I hope someone puts her behavior into context when she retells what happened.", "I dismissed this a few times because my gut feeling told me otherwise but I've called the non-emergency police number a moment ago. Mistakes happen but a few things don't add up. I thought because she didn't leave immediately upon hearing sounds or me shouting \"not a good time\", then knocking wouldn't be something someone like that would do. \n\nThe officer thought that it was weird as well and wrote down the description of her.", "She had a lot of audacity to join someone's yard and knock the door", "Yeah the days of being offered a cuppa when you enter a random house are gone. This lady is why folks lock their doors now. NTA", "And I assume your family friend apologized about entering the wrong house and not be all judgmental about it. Accidents can happen, it is all about how we responds about when it happens to us.\n\nIf your story happened to me and the person would apologized, I would have a good laugh about it with my neighbor.", "Yea I know", "A couple college students were stabbed to death in their house in Idaho pretty recently. Apparently that was a safe and quiet town too.", "Yea that's how all unfortunate incidents are. You never get hit by a car, mugged, unlawfully arrested, betrayed, scammed, or anything until you do. Locking a door is like looking before you cross the road. It should be ingrained into you and should be a reflex every you close the door.", "That's good. People can die for being this dim where I live", "Also, lock your front door when you're in to stop random asshole's entering!", "She had to open a gate, too. lol She also definitely didn't ring the bell. Maybe she turned the light on and off on the gate. That happens sometimes.", "Ya know, it was like, 12 years ago. I can\u2019t remember. But it was either they apologized or the homeowners weren\u2019t within earshot lol.", "It was my favorite ugly blanket. I wanted to show it off.", "Be cautious.   Though she might've come across as a fool, she instead might've been scoping out your property for a break in or theft.", "I thought about this, too. I checked the house and yard if something went missing. I will be extra vigilant from now on."]}
