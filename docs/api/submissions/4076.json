I\u2019m not into that.\u201d My husband the most non-confrontational man you will ever meet said \u201cNeither am I but you need to get the f**k out of my place before I call the cops.\u201d There was a bit of back and forth- reminder here my husband is still naked talking/yelling at this man. Come to find out we wanted the apt above ours. The person above us came down and apologized. The guy was new and they told him to just walk in as they were having lots of work done to their apt.
