This time it was my brothers birthday and my whole moms side of the family came down to celebrate with my brother like a normal family does. We have 1 guest bedroom. My aunt (F28) and uncle (M29) and 2 cousins both (F10). They live the farthest so they asked to stay the night and my mother said yes. Mind you there is only 1 bed in that room. My mom says oh yeah M/N can sleep on the couch in the living room and the kids can sleep in her room. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t of had a problem with it if she would have asked. Instead she volunteered me to do so. I told her that i would not be sleeping in the living room because she never asked me and was trying to force me so now i will not. I explained to her that if she would\u2019ve asked I would have said yes. She told me that it\u2019s her house and that she makes the rules so what she says goes.

Of course it\u2019s their house, but it\u2019s their moral and legal responsibility to house their children. It does not mean they get to use basic necessities, food, or shelter as any sort of weapon. She\u2019s wrong for that alone.", "NTA in 2 years she will throw you out of house and when she tries to contact you you can tell her 'not your house not your rules'. Why doesn't your mom give her room haha. Also this 'my house my rules' start to get tired, like what she can lock you in if she wants? Come on now.. She should watch her words if she doesn't want to be treated in the same way when she gets old and then wonder why.", "I can't get behind all these people calling you an AH for wanting the basic courtesy of being asked to vacate your own room. Sure, technically your mom pays for it (or at least, pays for more of it than you do), but it is still the space set aside for you, and teens do need their privacy.\n\nYour mom really should have asked you if you were OK giving up your room for the night. Now, if you had said no, it's ultimately still up to her where the guests sleep. But at least she would have been polite instead of simply assuming you'd give up your room. \n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA. I lost my bedroom to visitors because I was youngest. When we visited others I was on the floor or couch...because I was youngest so it makes sense to me that the younger cousins would have couches or floor", "NTA.  Your cousins are 10.  Let them camp out on the floor in the living room in sleeping bags and have a mini slumber party.  Put on age appropriate tv and put out some snacks.  They can watch and munch until they fall asleep.  Or they can sleep on a pallet on the floor of the guest room.", "NTA. Generally yelling and screaming at your child that they are ungrateful is never the correct play, and I think given the situation was very much uncalled for. As many people mentioned you will likely be fine a few nights on the couch but this is no way to treat your own teenage daughter.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. Your mother should have asked for your permission before volunteering your room for your cousins to sleep in, especially since it is your personal space and you have a right to feel comfortable and safe in it. It is not fair for her to force you to give up your room without your consent and then belittle you when you express your discomfort. It's important for family members to communicate and respect each other's boundaries and needs. You have a right to your feelings and your mother should have acknowledged and considered them instead of dismissing them", "Nta. If it's not an issue for your mom, she can sleep on the couch, and they can have her room", "I think it's funny how many people are saying YTA. I remember a post on this sub a little while back and the OP was the parent asking if they we TAH because their kid was upset they were having someone stay in their home, not their bedroom, just a spare I think? Anyway, OP got SO much backlash basically because it was that kids house to and they should be comfortable etc. That was basically the sum of it but everyone had different reasons why.", "My mom did this growing up and the other kids would steal stuff from my room. She would also make me sleep on the floor while they got the bed. I understand that they are guests but my cousins never had to do this for me, I still slept on the floor at their homes too. Anyway, I no longer go to family events.", "NTA wow usually I would side with parents about things happening in their home but your mom sounds very unreasonable right now.. and where your dad? Aunt and uncle need to buy a blow up bed and put in the guest room for their kids to sleep there with them.. you don\u2019t go to peoples homes to visit and kick them out of their beds.. I have so much more to say about mom but I don\u2019t want to get banned again\ud83d\ude33", "NTA", "If you are paying the bills then you have every right to be upset however, judging by your age, your mom pays the bills and it\u2019s up to her.", "NTA OP.\n\nIf she makes the rules she gets to pay all the bills too.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is taking something away from you that she should be providing anyway, a bed, and giving it to another. \n\nI can see letting the cousins sleep on the floor in the room with sleeping bags, but forcing you to give up the bed (which is also represents your personal space and a boundary) is a bridge too far.", "ESH\n\nYes, your mom should've discussed it with you first, but she is correct in that it is her house and what she says goes. As long as there's no abuse or neglect going on, of course. But this doesn't qualify. It's one night - I promise, you'll survive.\n\nIt sucks, but that's life. When you're 18 and get your own place, you'll get to make the rules. Until then, give your single mom a break.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t Your guests, if anyone should give up their room it\u2019s the one who\u2019s guest it is or the one who invited them.", "NAH it's understandable to be pissed but your mom's right", "NTA. When I visited family as a kid you know where I slept? On the couch or on the floor, never in one of the kids' rooms.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t the cousins sleep on the couch?  It\u2019s probably not as comfortable as OP\u2019s bed, but they\u2019re kids.", "ESH. \n\nYes,  you would like to have autonomy about your room but...\n\nMom pays the bills and is your parent. \n\nThis is where you get told to \n\nSuck it up this time\n\nAnd learn how to anticipate and negotiate by having excellent communication skills. \n\nMom's no peach,  but if you apologize for your temper,  maybe she'll chill out.  Negotiate later for something you want.", "NTA \n\nGo in and wake the kids up every single hour during the night.", "ESH\n\nIf you mom literally screamed at you that's a problem.  \n\nBut part of life is that kids are the ones who get bumped to sleeping bags when adults are guests in the home.  Most of us did it - a lot.  It's part of being a kid.  When you get older and live alone the good news is it doesn't happen anymore. You haven't been wronged.", "I don't know if you have any say in the matter.  It may be \"your\" room, but only because someone else gave you permission to use it.", "This is so weird to me, because when I was a kid, whatever needed to be done got done and it didn't really matter if it pleased me. It never would've occurred to me to require my parents to ask me to vacate my room. I don't know that it was necessary for her to scream at you, but damn, is it really THAT big a deal to let guests have your room for one night?", "ESH. Your mom shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you, but you keep saying that it would have been different if she asked which leads me to believe you would have said yes and your issue is only not being asked. This is her home and I do find it weird that you are so bothered by this. If she told you ten minutes before they showed and you didn\u2019t have a chance to make sure your stuff was protected and anything private was out away, that would be one thing. But it sounds like she gave you notice and it IS her house.", "My mom made sure I understood that I did not \"have\" a room.  I \"used\" a room in her house. I had no ownership.\n\nI think it would have been nice to give you a heads up. You could have asked her later to please give you a heads up next time.\n\n Instead, you chose to disrespect your mother by openly defying her in front of company.  All because your free loading self felt entitled to be asked to use something that belongs to her.  \n\n I imagine she was mortified that this **edit***, no rent paying, child was telling her what they were and were not going to do in her housep. But you didn't ask if your mom was the asshole you asked if you were the asshole.\n\nSo yes. YTA for humiliating and embarrassing your mother in front of company for no other reason than your ego.", "ESH\n\nYour Mom should have asked you in advance, instead of being voluntold.\n\nHowever, people are traveling from afar and need one night's stay. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect being shifted for a family party - it's what families generally do. And, if you went to visit you cousins, aunt, and uncle, they would make room for you (Every Thanksgiving we played musical beds/couches to make room for people driving 100s of miles for the long weekend and asking around, it was pretty much par for the course among my friends and neighbors)\n\nCommunication and respect was lacking all around.", "YTA, it's not your room, it's not your house.", "You\u2019re 15 and living in your mom\u2019s house right? It may suck but YTA.  It would\u2019ve been considerate of your mom to have asked but ultimately it is her house", "ESH. yes, when you have houseguests, there's going to be some inconvenience and you need to be thoughtful of your guests and it is your parent's house. \nIf your mom was screaming at you and saying you were a wretched ungrateful child, then she's also TAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My parents tried offering up my room to fsmily and I was like nope. It\u2019s my private safe space and the thought of someone else in my bed gave me anxiety", "NTA. It's your space.

Your cousins can sleep in the lounge room.", "Well for one thing she hasn't said what that contribution looks like - she's 15.  It can't be that much.  \n\nAnd two - OP only added that edit after a bunch of YTA answers came in saying you don't pay the bills.", "she\u2019s also REALLY mad at her mom rn, 2 separate AITA posts right in a row is a lot, typically 15yo stuff but still, her words should probably be taken with a grain of salt atm", "Apparently the mom can lock her in the room and say 'my house my rules' since some ppl here support so much this sentence. Love goes to second fate, long live tyranny in the house 'my house my rules'", "Well hold on.  She has shelter.  One night on the sofa is not failing to provide shelter.  It's not abuse.  It's not using a weapon.  \n\nOne night on a couch.  Basic necessities are met and then some.  So much drama over one night on a couch.", "lol Giving her room up for a night is hardly taking any of those things away from her ffs. Op - YTA.

Kids have been vacating rooms to accomodate visiting relatives for eternity. It's just one night, for real.", "Helping out with the bills is not paying the mortgage.  I did not see the job part.  But honestly, just your reply here is enough for me to know YTA. Again, you could have just clarified, but instead, you want to act like an ass.  Enjoy.", "Because it's her Mom's house so she can divvy up the bedrooms as she sees fit, also two people can't share a couch but two people can share a bed so it's the only way that everyone can have somewhere soft to sleep.

Mom is not a housemate, not sure what kind of logic you're using here friend.", "That part didn't really sink in when I read the post. I still think it's right that the guests are offered the bedroom and I would have definitely talked to my teen before hand.\n\nI don't feel tenant is the best word for OP. Yes, she and her brother are working part time and helping with the bc they are a family and are working together for the welfare of all, hopefully. Every member of the family should feel respected and that their needs and wants can be expressed and considered\nIn a perfect world, anyway", "I would never kick my kids out of their own beds for other kids to come sleep in their beds instead. Then mom can't give her a heads up and then freaks out OP is upset. Someone's bedroom is a private, intimate place, I wouldn't want anyone taking mine over. She's also 15 years old and has no obligation to contribute to household bills as she's a dependent. If she does work it should be for her own things and not have to pay bills. Sounds like mom doesn't care about or have any respect for OP. That's her home to, not just her moms, again, she's a DEPENDENT.", "How do you know that, by the time I was 15 I was paying all our rent. Was raised by alcoholic boomers so I paid the rent and older brother bought the food, we had 5 siblings. So you really do not know how much she is contributing. Also mother is responsible for providing her food, clothing and space until she is 18, not child\u2019s fault her mother\u2019s circumstances prevent that and her and her brother have stepped up to help out. So for her mother to have absolutely no respect for her to even ask her but just scream at her. She is absolutely NTA. I am also a widowed single mom and I have always asked my daughter opinion/permission to use something of hers. Hell I won\u2019t even post a pic of her on social media without her permission since she was young enough to have an opinion about it. Respect is a two way street, even from parents.", "Agreed.  I wasn't asked, I was told what sleeping arrangements were.  And yeah that meant as the youngest in the family I got bumped because. Teen on the couch is one thing and an older person is another.  Most everyone did this as children.  Because that's life.", "yeah cuz your coming at me like an asshat, but okay! thank tou", "[deleted]", "100% this. OP is also only 15 years old and has no say what her parents ask of them. When they\u2019re 18 then they can do whatever they want.", "No, she's ofc not legally a Tennant, but you lose the moral high ground to play the \"my house my rules\" card over your kid's living space when you make them even partly responsible for household expenses.", "Mom obviously gave her a head's up or there wouldn't have been a conversation.  \n\nMom likely freaked out because of OPs flat out refusal and defiance by saying 'I won't'. \n\nI agree that OP shouldn't have to work to contribute to the family but that's not the issue here and that's hardly uncommon because life sucks and is hard and inconvenient sometimes.", "Well presumably there are child labor laws.  And they live in a 4 bedroom house so they aren't absolutely in poverty.  But OP can explain and we don't have to ponder.", "I can't even count the number of times I slept in the living room, or the basement, or on the floor, or a pull out couch. Hell, I spent a YEAR sleeping in a recliner in the living room because we had to live with my grandparents for a while. It never would have occurred to me to question my parents about it because it was what we fucking needed to do at the time. Cry me a river over having to sleep on the couch for one single night so family can stay over. And I'm not the type to say \"well back in my day\" and suggest people should just put up with unreasonable shit. This is not unreasonable. This is one night.", "Child. You literally came on to AITA to see if you were an AH.  Then you get pissy because some says you are.   I have answered your question and don't see a need to continue.  Good noght.", "True, but I would hope OP would not remove herself from her family over something as small as this in the grand scheme of things. It would seem a petty reason to do so.", "Well, that's the most ridiculous reason ever to cut off a parent ever suggested.  Sleeping on the couch one night? \n\nNews flash.  If she turns 18 and walks out on her family sleeping on a couch one night will be the least of her housing concerns.", ">And I'm not the type to say \"well back in my day\"\n\nAnd \n\n>I can't even count the number of times I slept in the living room, or the basement, or on the floor, or a pull out couch.
