Of course it\u2019s their house, but it\u2019s their moral and legal responsibility to house their children. It does not mean they get to use basic necessities, food, or shelter as any sort of weapon. She\u2019s wrong for that alone.", "NTA in 2 years she will throw you out of house and when she tries to contact you you can tell her 'not your house not your rules'. Why doesn't your mom give her room haha. Also this 'my house my rules' start to get tired, like what she can lock you in if she wants? Come on now.. She should watch her words if she doesn't want to be treated in the same way when she gets old and then wonder why.", "I can't get behind all these people calling you an AH for wanting the basic courtesy of being asked to vacate your own room. Sure, technically your mom pays for it (or at least, pays for more of it than you do), but it is still the space set aside for you, and teens do need their privacy.\n\nYour mom really should have asked you if you were OK giving up your room for the night. Now, if you had said no, it's ultimately still up to her where the guests sleep. But at least she would have been polite instead of simply assuming you'd give up your room. \n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA. I lost my bedroom to visitors because I was youngest. When we visited others I was on the floor or couch...because I was youngest so it makes sense to me that the younger cousins would have couches or floor", "NTA.  Your cousins are 10.  Let them camp out on the floor in the living room in sleeping bags and have a mini slumber party.  Put on age appropriate tv and put out some snacks.  They can watch and munch until they fall asleep.  Or they can sleep on a pallet on the floor of the guest room.", "NTA. Generally yelling and screaming at your child that they are ungrateful is never the correct play, and I think given the situation was very much uncalled for. As many people mentioned you will likely be fine a few nights on the couch but this is no way to treat your own teenage daughter.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. Your mother should have asked for your permission before volunteering your room for your cousins to sleep in, especially since it is your personal space and you have a right to feel comfortable and safe in it. It is not fair for her to force you to give up your room without your consent and then belittle you when you express your discomfort. It's important for family members to communicate and respect each other's boundaries and needs. You have a right to your feelings and your mother should have acknowledged and considered them instead of dismissing them", "Nta.

I remember a post on this sub a little while back and the OP was the parent asking if they we TAH because their kid was upset they were having someone stay in their home, not their bedroom, just a spare I think? Anyway, OP got SO much backlash basically because it was that kids house to and they should be comfortable etc. That was basically the sum of it but everyone had different reasons why.", "My mom did this growing up and the other kids would steal stuff from my room.

Anyway, I no longer go to family events.", "NTA wow usually I would side with parents about things happening in their home but your mom sounds very unreasonable right now.. and where your dad? Aunt and uncle need to buy a blow up bed and put in the guest room for their kids to sleep there with them.. you don\u2019t go to peoples homes to visit and kick them out of their beds..

As long as there's no abuse or neglect going on, of course. But this doesn't qualify. It's one night - I promise, you'll survive.\n\nIt sucks, but that's life.

It\u2019s probably not as comfortable as OP\u2019s bed, but they\u2019re kids.", "ESH. \n\nYes,  you would like to have autonomy about your room but...\n\nMom pays the bills and is your parent. \n\nThis is where you get told to \n\nSuck it up this time\n\nAnd learn how to anticipate and negotiate by having excellent communication skills. \n\nMom's no peach,  but if you apologize for your temper,  maybe she'll chill out.  Negotiate later for something you want.", "NTA \n\nGo in and wake the kids up every single hour during the night.", "ESH\n\nIf you mom literally screamed at you that's a problem.  \n\nBut part of life is that kids are the ones who get bumped to sleeping bags when adults are guests in the home.  Most of us did it - a lot.  It's part of being a kid.  When you get older and live alone the good news is it doesn't happen anymore. You haven't been wronged.", "I don't know if you have any say in the matter.  It may be \"your\" room, but only because someone else gave you permission to use it.", "This is so weird to me, because when I was a kid, whatever needed to be done got done and it didn't really matter if it pleased me. It never would've occurred to me to require my parents to ask me to vacate my room. I don't know that it was necessary for her to scream at you, but damn, is it really THAT big a deal to let guests have your room for one night?", "ESH. Your mom shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you, but you keep saying that it would have been different if she asked which leads me to believe you would have said yes and your issue is only not being asked. This is her home and I do find it weird that you are so bothered by this. If she told you ten minutes before they showed and you didn\u2019t have a chance to make sure your stuff was protected and anything private was out away, that would be one thing. But it sounds like she gave you notice and it IS her house.", "My mom made sure I understood that I did not \"have\" a room.  I \"used\" a room in her house. I had no ownership.\n\nI think it would have been nice to give you a heads up. You could have asked her later to please give you a heads up next time.\n\n Instead, you chose to disrespect your mother by openly defying her in front of company.  All because your free loading self felt entitled to be asked to use something that belongs to her.  \n\n I imagine she was mortified that this **edit***, no rent paying, child was telling her what they were and were not going to do in her housep. But you didn't ask if your mom was the asshole you asked if you were the asshole.\n\nSo yes. YTA for humiliating and embarrassing your mother in front of company for no other reason than your ego.", "ESH\n\nYour Mom should have asked you in advance, instead of being voluntold.\n\nHowever, people are traveling from afar and need one night's stay. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect being shifted for a family party - it's what families generally do. And, if you went to visit you cousins, aunt, and uncle, they would make room for you (Every Thanksgiving we played musical beds/couches to make room for people driving 100s of miles for the long weekend and asking around, it was pretty much par for the course among my friends and neighbors)\n\nCommunication and respect was lacking all around.", "YTA, it's not your room, it's not your house.", "You\u2019re 15 and living in your mom\u2019s house right?

(also legality isn\u2019t the same as morality) i\u2019m not saying she did something illegal or horrific. but it\u2019s bad enough op won\u2019t say on a completely anonymous forum and bad enough for randos to send her (a child) hate. \n\nim using the context clues provided while you\u2019re making shit up. we are talking about a 15 year old who posted two AITA about her mom within 15 minutes of each other. does it not seem like she just needed some validation? again i\u2019m not saying what OP did was wrong in either situation, but she\u2019s acting like a hurt child- bc she is. children don\u2019t know the extent of what goes on with their parents. she doesn\u2019t know who mom told. she doesn\u2019t know how many ppl mom told. all she knows is that people are sending her hate because they found out. again, OP is allowed to be mad. but we don\u2019t know enough to make judgment.", "ESH, it suck that your mom would even offer your room, let alone without asking. But if you would give it up otherwise and openly say it to your mom like you want to teach her a lesson then I get why she is annoyed", "YTA\n\nThis is what you do when people sleep over. You double up, or someone takes the couch.", "while i remember sharing space in my room with family, i never was kicked out of my own bed.", "NTA op. Threaten to not pay bills if they stay in your room and follow through. Get your sibling in on it to. That should knock her down a notch.", "NTA", "She\u2019s 15. What job do you think she can get at that age to actually be able to afford rent? Let\u2019s be realistic here", "So why can't mom spend \"one night on the couch\"? She was the one who agreed to play hostess, it was on her to make the sleeping arrangement work smoothly and she failed to do so by not being polite to her daughter. Clearly the next choice is sleeping there herself.", "Happy Cake Day! (we share a cake day!!!) Now, if I could just find us a cake... \ud83d\ude00", "I never said she pays all or even half of the rent or monthly bills but she's for 1 still a dependent, minor and 2nd it's her bedroom. A bedroom is a private, intimate place for someone and I wouldn't want anyone taking over my room. The fact that this child is even contributing to the bills in her house, should warrant her to at least have a say in her damn bedroom.", "The moms relying on her to make ends meet, OP should get a say in the house.", "i didn\u2019t say she shouldn\u2019t. but she isn\u2019t a tenant. she is a child who is helping out her family. she should have been asked. but she is not a tenant. \n\ntenants sign contracts and have a duty of rent. we have no idea what percentage op is paying. a child cannot be a tenant. she is just a really upset kid and that\u2019s valid."]}
