Before she moved, she was involved with a man (DeWayne) that she met in college. When they decided to date, he courted her the proper way. You could tell he had manners. Flowers. Dates. You name it. He was all in. She still decided to move several hours away. Every time she would come back home to visit, she always included him in her plans no matter how long her stay was in the city. Over the course of these years, she has had relationships and I\u2019m sure he has too, but they always seem to connect. \n\nIn May, Tiffani calls me and says she\u2019s ready to stop playing games and she wants to move back to our hometown to be with DeWayne. I wasn\u2019t in agreement that she should move back for him, but she told me she knew what she was doing. She came down to shop for apartments. He chauffeured her. She didn\u2019t even tell us she was home. She moved at the beginning of July. He helped her. Even arranged movers for her. She didn\u2019t tell us. I didn\u2019t know she had her apartment set up until she asked me to come by to see it. She told me their plans for her to move into his house\u2026 but she signed for a 12 month lease? She also told me that the man is depressed and will frequently not talk to her for days at a time which was also very weird. \n\nAt some point, I asked her how they were doing and she said that she hadn\u2019t talked to him in weeks. I could tell that this was causing her a lot of stress, so I told her to be prepared in case he has someone else. She got extremely upset with me, saying that I don\u2019t know him like she does and she didn\u2019t appreciate me trying to ruin her relationship. I backed off. Two weeks later, I am at a mixer with my boyfriend. I see him and another woman together. I didn\u2019t approach him. I kept my distance, just surveying what was going on until I saw the woman flashing a ring to a person I know. Of course I had to ask the person who this woman is and she said \u201coh! That\u2019s my home girl from college. Her and her man just got engaged.\u201d\n\nI immediately thought to call my sister, but based on the way she treated me when I suggested there was someone else, I decided not to. I don\u2019t think she would believe me. So am I the asshole for sitting on this information?", "created_utc": 1669839909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z925bu/aita_for_not_telling_my_sister_a_man_she_has/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I say you just say- look- I know you don't wanna hear this, but I saw dude at the XYZ mixer (be detailed) and he was with his fianc\u00e9e and they were showing rings. Confirmed to me by a friend of the fianc\u00e9e. I'm telling you 1) because I would want to know and 2)because I believe if you found out I knew this and didn't tell you that you would be far more upset with me than you're probably going to get right now.  Do what you want with this info, but I saw what I saw. Now you know, my conscience is clear either way.", "NTA.  \n\nYour sister sounds a bit disconnected from reality.  How does she say \"the plan was for her to move into his house\" when it sounds like that conversation never happened, given that she signed a 12-month lease?  And that he's \"depressed\" and doesn't talk to her for several days? (Probably because the dude only sees her as a friend and has his own life?).\n\nI dunno, but I get bad vibes about your sister and her obsession with DeWayne.  I wouldn't tell your sister because I'd fear what your sister might do to DeWayne's fiancee once she (your sister) figured out who she was.", "NTA but also not a great sister if you do not tell her.", "NTA. Let the shit show play out on its own. She's in too deep and won't believe you. If you want to try and let her know I'd recommend *anonymously* sending her a photo of their engagement announcement if you can get your hands on it.", "NTA but I would check his social media and see what's up then talk to your sister. Guaranteed that if he is engaged it will be on his social media.", "I cannot say you are TA because you have time to do the right thing. \n\nYou must tell your sister what you know. No matter what her reaction is, it would be cruel to keep this from her. I understand that this puts you in a difficult position but in the long run, I believe she should hear this from you. \n\nIf I was in your place I would be honest with her. Even if she 'kills the messenger' it would be a thousand times worse if when she finally finds out (and you Know it's inevitable) and that you knew all along she would never trust you again.", "YTA if you don\u2019t tell her. Absolutely. She may shoot the messenger until she verifies it for herself.  But she\u2019ll never forgive you if she finds out you knew and never told her.", "NTA, you've tried to warned her, she didn't want to hear it. unfortunatly you have to let her be...", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s her business.

Your sister didn't want your opinion and you haven't actually heard it from the  horse himself.  So let her find out on her own.\n\nUnless she shows you an engagement ring...then I might try to find a way to prove it(engagement notice in a paper? the woman's facebook account?)", "YTA if you don't at least tell her it \"seems like\" they're engaged based on what you heard/saw, and maybe she should look into it. You don't quite know for sure.", "NTA but also get solid proof and send it through and anonymous source maybe? but either way you cut it you have to also tell the fiance she's innocent (most likely)", "NTA. Tell her the truth immediately. She may hate you for the short term but will hopefully realize you were looking at her best interests. 2 timing people piss me off. And your sister moved back for this con artist. Ugh.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your news to tell.\n\nLet Tiffani find out for herself that Dewayne helped her as a friend and had moved on.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA she wouldn\u2019t believe you anyways she will find out", "NTA but next time get a \"selfie\" that shows DeWayne in the background.. bonus points if he's touch the other woman.", "She will get the picture soon.

You had a window, it's closed now. All of the behavior from sister is red flaggy and it makes you wonder how she presented this all to DeWayne. Did he realize this was suppose to be a rekindle, or did he think they were just friends all these years?\n\nI have a family member like OPs sister in a way...expects people to be mind readers about their romantic intentions. Lots of awkwardness, loneliness and heartbreak have been witnessed over the years.", "I can\u2019t check his social media because we aren\u2019t friends and his FB is private. Trust me, I tried \ud83d\ude05", "If she chooses not to trust me after I have told her how I initially felt, that\u2019s on her. I\u2019m saying that because she rather put her trust in a man* who has obviously ghosted her. I\u2019m her sister. The least she could\u2019ve done was hear me out and find out things for herself, but instead she didn\u2019t want to listen to reason and wanted to push me away. That\u2019s not fair at all.", "That was my initial argument with her before she came back home. How you leave for 10 years and think you\u2019re supposed to just pick back up? But throughout this whole process, DeWayne has been there. Multiple pics of them out on dates. She didn\u2019t actually reach out to me to say she was here permanently until HE started ghosting her. I think he couldn\u2019t keep up with dating her AND his fianc\u00e9e.", "What about his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s?", "It\u2019s not fair, but she\u2019s in denial, and it was just a hunch when you first told her. But now you know with 100% certainty that it\u2019s real. You can\u2019t keep that from her.", "I bet your sister sensed him pulling away because he was getting serious with fianc\u00e9, and realized she needed to stop stringing him along. Only it was too little, too late.", "It sounds like he liked to keep your sister around as his backup plan", "Where they dates or just friends out for a night?  They could look alike--unless they were making out in photos.", "I could ask my acquaintance, but at the same time, me inquiring further would cause suspicion.", "According to what OP said, it sounds more like he was her backup.", "Are you fb friends with your acquaintance? If so look through their list of friends for the fiance", "YTA please tell her!! What she does with that info is not your problem but it would be beyond shitty to enable this guy in playing your own sister, especially when she's uprooted her whole life for him.", "INFO: was DeWayne actually courting her, making plans to move her in? Because if he was leading your sister on, I feel like that is info his fianc\u00e9 should have. If he\u2019s just a gentleman helping an old friend and the talks of moving in are in your sister\u2019s head though\u2026 you should still talk to DeWayne and his partner to let them know your sister make have an unrealistic understanding of their relationship. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d just send a message to the fianc\u00e9e saying just that, because it allows for room your sister is just misreading his kindness while also ensuring if he really is messing around on her, she knows to pay attention and investigate on her own. Win win. \u201cHey, I saw you with Dewayne at (party) and I just wanted to let you know my sister has it in her head that she moved to be with DeWayne and will move in with him soon. Clearly that isn\u2019t DeWayne\u2019s plans, but I wanted to give you the heads up so you can talk to DeWayne about it and make sure he stays safe and is aware of how my sister is interpreting his kindness and their time together. I hope it\u2019s okay that I reached out and congrats on the engagement! I wish you both well in life.\u201d", "NTA.\nThis is karma. \n\"It's time to stop playing games.\"? Yeah. Uh. It wasn't ever time to start playing games, and DeWayne did the right thing for himself and moved on. I hope he's happy with this new girl.", "Please have the last award my broke self can afford until the next year at best!!!!\n\nOP if you don't tell her, You Are TA!!!  \n\nObviously how you tell her is going to be just as important as the fact that you are telling her. Yes she is going to be upset. Accept it and deal with it. But put yourself in her shoes, if it were you, would you want her or someone else to tell you, or would you prefer to find out the hard way?\n\nThere are times when we really do have no choice but to get involved. Failure to do so makes us truly lesser than as human beings.", "Yeah, there was another post where thr sisters boyfriend was hitting on OP and she told the sister and the whole family turned on her and the boyfriend denied it. \n\nThis OPs sister seems a bit not all there and I can see her doing the same. \n\nNTA for not wanting to get involved but you are screwed either way.", "Oh wow. Wish she had included this info in the original post. Yeah, I\u2019d be hesitant to tell her also. She is screwed either way.", "They mean a separate OP. That was a bad scenario. The OP was a minor and the guy was a creep.", "While I agree they can look alike (my best friend and I get this a LOT, even from random strangers) - dude hasn't told her about his fiancee. That's pretty sus. If they were really just friends hanging out, why not tell her about his serious relationship?", "If Fianc\u00e9e was showing off ring--they may have just got engaged.  And he might not have wanted to let anyone know he was going to propose until he did(and got a yes).\n\nSister seems to have some delusions and doesn't want to hear anything that doesn't fit her image of the situation.  DeWayne may have told her about his girlfriend and she's just mentally blocked it--just as she thought she was moving in with him yet also signed a 12 month lease.", "He didnt have to tell her that he was planning to propose. He could have simply said \"I'm in a relationship now\". If he hasn't told her that much, something is sketchy. \n\nI agree that the sister seems unhinged, but we don't know if she really is or if this man has manipulated her into believing he is single and interested in her still.", "Absolutely, I was offering alternative explanations that might be equally viable.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I think this is a case of staying out of someone else's drama. Tiffani has asked you to back off. Offer that you saw DeWayne at a party and leave it there for her to ask. If she doesn't, leave it be. If she does, be brief and to the point--he was there with his fiancee.", "This is the best approach!", "I don\u2019t know his fianc\u00e9e to message her. Because if this is delusions on my sister\u2019s part, I\u2019d rather not break up a happy home. To hear my sister tell it, they had this move in conversation AFTER she signed her lease. For at least a month, I didn\u2019t even know she moved back and settled into her apartment.", "It wouldn't be on her if you don't tell her and she realizes she can't trust you. Because... wait for it... she wouldn't be able to trust you.", "Like I said, I told her to be prepared. She said I was trying to to ruin her relationship. Sounds like she already doesn\u2019t trust me or my judgement.", "This is all so bizarre I'm wondering if they were really together, or they had broken up and remained friends, to him, but sister didn't get it? \n\nLike that post where the dude didn't realize he wasn't dating his girlfriend until she got engaged? But more delusional, less autism?", "They broke up when she left for Chicago 10 years ago, but they always kept in touch. Whenever she would come to visit, they would see each other. Now as far as them being in a relationship now? I would consider it only dating. She never told me that they were exclusive or that was her boyfriend. She came here to rekindle that flame with him, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gone beyond dates at this point."]}
