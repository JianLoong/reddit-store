YTA and now you should use your disposable income to remove your stupid tattoo.", "YTA you're one of those people who can't let other people just enjoy things aren't you?", "YTA. big time. \n\nso, your grown adult of a son isn\u2019t allowed to get something on his body that he likes and enjoys? as long as it\u2019s not some sick offensive tattoo, who cares? he likes it, it probably builds his confidence. \n\nif someone ever asks you two why you got the tattoos, it\u2019ll be so much easier for him to explain it\u2019s because he likes it, whilst you have to explain you did it because you\u2019re petty and controlling and thought it was a good life lesson to give to someone who\u2019s already an adult. you need help. YTA.", "YTA. Did it occur to you that your son's tattoo *was* a mistake, it will become its own punishment given time? If your son ends up regretting it, he'll either be stuck with something he dislikes and regrets on his body, or have to pay a lot of money and suffer to get it out. So your son will either get the punishment you wished for, or the tattoo will turn out to not be a mistake at all.\n\n\nMeanwhile, you now have a meaningless tattoo - something you supposedly hate - that you got out of spite and will harm your relationship with your son. Do you see how incredibly stupid that sounds? Do you think this is a win?", "YTA but you\u2019re a funny AH.", "YTA for purposefully stealing your son's joy in having a \"cool\" tattoo. The only lesson he learned was that you're willing to go pretty far to make him feel bad.\n\nOn an unrelated note, I'm hoping one day to get a tattoo with no special meaning. It'll be a shrimp playing a jazz saxophone.", "yta", "YTA and a massive hypocrite", "| People can decorate themselves however they want. \n\nBut.. not your son of legal adult age\u2026 yes YTA. Your issues with tattoos are not your sons problem. Grow up.", "YTA\n\nYou permanently marked your body to embarrass your son. He can't just undo the tattoo. If your whole point was to make him regret getting a tattoo, now you both have stupid tattoos. Instead of preventing him from making a bad decision, you doubled it. I can't imagine what you thought you were accomplishing.", "I think it\u2019s silly to get a meaningless tattoo just to prove a point too. Who did this teach a lesson to? Because now you have a tattoo you didn\u2019t want. YTA", "So....now you have a meaningless tattoo which I'm sure looks less cool on you vs your son. Yep YTA.", "If I had been the son, I would have gotten a temporary penis/dildo tattoo", "Huge YTA", "Yes, YTA, but man\u2026 what a crazy move. I think it\u2019s also a great tattoo story.", "Opinions are like \u2026..YTA. Nothing wrong with getting a tattoo because you like it. It doesn\u2019t have to have any significance and some people (lots actually) get them for reasons other than to \u201clook cool\u201d.", "YTA - tattoos can be whatever you want and they don\u2019t have to be meaningful or anything else. They are art in and of themselves. When someone asks you the meaning of your tattoo what are you going to tell them? This tattoo my absolute commitment to pettiness and shitty parenting?", "YTA. You think it\u2019s silly to get a tattoo just because it looks cool, but not silly to get one just to make your kid feel bad? Do better.", "Agreed. And just because that is how OP views tattoos doesn\u2019t mean son has to have the same opinion. So many ways YTA in one little incident.", "I\u2019m just left drowning in all the irony of Op\u2019s actions, you didn\u2019t want your child to get a \u201cmeaningless tattoo\u201d so you went ahead and got an arguably even more meaningless tattoo. \n\nHe got inked in an art pattern he liked and appealed to him. He\u2019s now being humiliated and mocked by his own parent because he dared to express himself the way he see\u2019s fit. \n\nIf he\u2019d gone off on a tangent spouting some pretentious garbage on what his tattoo symbolised would that have made you feel better even if he made it all up just to appease your nonsense reasoning? \n\nYTA.", "imagine him having to explain to someone why he has it lol", "I'd say there's an 80% chance that, even now, at least one of his friends is advising him to get a particularly bad and prominent temporary tattoo so that you'll copy it.", "On the contrary, OP's tattoo is meaningful and well thought out.  It says \"I thought long and hard on how to permanently show the world I'm an AH.\"", "YTA. Seriously!\n\n At least OP's tattoo has a story and meaning behind it - may be get an AH right next to the band tattoo for more clarity.", "Ah, see this is a parent who is \u201cokay\u201d with something, just not for THEIR kid. It\u2019s clearly very different. Don\u2019t ask me how, but it is, I promise. (S/)", "literally", "Haha my dad got our family name researched and it had a crest and a motto (Scottish), so instead of getting the crest, we both thought it would be cool to get the script of the motto. Well, I got it for my 20th birthday as a surprise and showed him thinking he\u2019d get it after I pulled the trigger since it was his idea for both of us to get it. He thought it was cool but never went and got one. But then he got an Ironman tattoo after his Ironman. I was kinda bummed, never said anything about it and I love that tat (I have a couple others now) but thought I\u2019d share since I was the kid who wanted a matching tat and my dad ended up not lol. Maybe he was bummed we didn\u2019t go together? Idk but yeah matching tats and Ironman tats we are cringe bros.", "I wonder if there is an Idiot Of The Year Award. OP wins it. YTA", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.", "Getting a sexy matching tattoo with grandma is a new one. Big points for originality.", "I'm not sure which tribe has a tattoo that resembles the cover of a Red Hot Chili Peppers album.", "There\u2019s being contrarian and exploring an unpopular viewpoint, and then there\u2019s being obtuse and completely neglecting major aspects of one.\n\nThe OPs son was living their life in a way that had no negative impact on the OP, and the OP\u2019s response was to act in a way with the deliberate intention of trying to make their son feel foolish.  Are you just completely ignoring the intent here, or deciding because there\u2019s no material harm, intent doesn\u2019t matter?", "That actually tends to be where I fall. \n\nIf anything OP was TA to himself for getting a permanent tattoo that was not really wanted.\n\nBut if the 19 year old liked his tattoo b/c it looks cool\u2026well it still looks cool?\n\nAnd tons of people have tribal armbands so \u2026.", "OP is TA, but this is very much not cultural appropriation. Not anymore than drinking tea or doing yoga is.", "Really? Which tribe has the heavy metal inspired armbands?", "It'll be a conversation starter!\n\n\"Hey, cool tattoo, you're a metalhead too?\" \"No, I just got this to show my son that his tattoo was stupid.\"", "For this reason, I love OP\u2019s tattoo. And would like to suggest a Canada goose as their next one.", "Ugh that was my mom to a T. She taught me all about acceptance and compassion. That we can't judge others for the color of their skin or the people they love. \n\nCue meltdown when she found out I was pan. \ud83d\ude44 how \"accepting\" of you mother. \n\nShe told me I was just selfish and \"gluttonous.\" That I was a sexual deviant who \"wanted it all,\" and it was UNNATURAL. ugh. \n\nThankfully that was years ago and she has changed a lot since then. But it's something that will always stay with me.", "But your story is cute and meaningful. OP here is being petty and as a result the son is marked for life. Lmao. When I think about it a little more it\u2019s funny.", "Samoan, Bornean, Polynesian, Maori, etc. There are many it just depends on whose style they used.", "I just don't see what the big deal is. The son admitted that the tattoo wasn't really important, so who cares if someone else has it?\n\nIf I got a tattoo tribute to a recently deceased loved one, and someone else copied me and got the same exact thing, I'd be upset.\n\nBut if it was just a random tattoo, I don't see the harm.", "The one you've a part of now: the Dumbass people of North America.", "If you really want to be that way, heavy metal bands might have pulled inspiration from tribal art. Those tribes existed way before those bands. This isn't really relevant to the story, but I think you're crazy if you think tribal art came from bands.", "Omg. I want a \u201cshow my kid they did something stupid\u201d tattoo!!", "\"You got a problem with Canada Gooses, yada, yada, yada. . .\"", "I\u2019m searching for a new tattoo design. I hadn\u2019t thought of a Canada Goose. Sounds pretty good.", "Cobra chicken!", "I think that's funny af I would do it to one of my kids just for the laughs but that's probably why we're all dicks to each other now.", "I suggest you let that one marinate, and all that.", "Is that a different breed than geese?/s"]}
