Majority of water birds or ground living birds will accept young and think it's theirs if the young is approximately the same age as their current litter (they can also accept a different specie's chicks if the chicks look close enough alike). This is most likely due to the strong parenting instinct required. Birds who's young develop slower (songbirds, birds of prey, doves etc) are much less likely to accept stranger's chicks. In some cases, wildlife rehabers can sneak orphan chicks under a captive kept bird of the same specie while it is roosting it's chicks or sneak one under while it is still incubating eggs if the chick is young enough- however the former is very risky in most species of wild birds as they'll recognise the orphan as a foreign chick and kick it out of the nest or peck it to death.\n\nI digress. Canadian geese are bullies, they can suddenly decide to drown other water birds chicks and even other geeses goslings as well- because they have decided they own all the water their eyes can see. The pairs with chicks also harass other geese pairs with chicks, but none of the pairs in my lake has actually intentionally hurt the others' chicks, but they don't care about them.
