It's just not this girl.", "NTA- it sounds like you might not be right for each other. People do make small changes for each other that\u2019s part of how we grow and learn about ourselves BUT she knew who you were when you got together right? So be yourself.", "\"screamed at me that I didn't love her and I wasn't being considerate of her feelings.\"\n\nYeah, you're not a flat tire she can change or fix.  If dressing Fem is a part of who you are, then she either has to accept it or you two need to split.\n\nNTA. You do you.", "Did she start dating u with the expectation that you would change your personality and expression for her?? Dress how you want and leave her, nobody that loves you would sit there and complain that u wont dress how they want u too", "NTA. Find a new gf. There's not much else to say.", "Run", "NTA. \n\nGet a new girlfriend.  Just like when people say 'she can dress how she wants', so can you. And if someone doesn't like it, they can move on and let you be you.", "NTA, as a trans female, I can guarantee you that you won't be happy if you're forced to dress, act or do anything that isn't what you are or want.\n\nRun while you can.", "NTA. Now is where you learn the lesson that feeling comfortable in your own skin is more important than what your partner thinks/wants. If she can't accept you how you are, it's time to end it. \n\nDon't forget.. she says you don't love her or consider her feelings, yet she isn't being considerate of yours.", "NTA - your body, your rules. As a partner she doesn't get to dictate what you wear. Your love for her or her feelings have nothing to do with it. Imagine a scenario where a man behaves like this with a woman, it would be labeled as controlling and abusive behavior. I'd say this is a huge red flag and you may want to have a serious conversation with her or break it off.", "NTA.

She's the one that doesn't love you and isn't being considerate of your feelings, she's just turned it around because she's horrendously manipulative.\n\nShe decided she wanted to try to change you into the image of what she wanted, rather than accepting you as you are. Please, ditch her and live your best life.", "NTA. Your partner shouldn't dictate the way you dress. Of course she can express the things she likes, but you should feel free to wear what you love the most and what makes YOU happy. She's definitely TA here.", "Dump her. She doesnt accept you for who you are as a person and not considering how you are feeling. Who cares what clothes you wear they are only clothes. Dress whatever makes you feel right and just put your foot down. Its her problem.", "NTA but it doesnt really sound like shes interested in who you actually are. Rather, who she wants you to be. Much to consider", "NTA, she\u2019s not considerate of *your* feelings. Sounds like she\u2019s trying to fix you.", "NTA. This sounds like a basic compatibility issue and it doesn\u2019t matter how much you like her, one of you will always be unhappy. Be yourself, dress how you feel comfortable, and move on from this relationship.", "imagine bagging a guy that dresses more fem and fucking things up like this smh", "NTA. Sounds like something changed. Maybe your gf likes your fem style, but has caught some flak for it from someone more judgemental. Sorry this has become your problem, I hope you can find out what happened, but don't blame yourself.", "NTA. Screamed? That's extreme. You two need to talk about this.", "Nta but she is", "NTA Escape while you can", "NTA do what you want with your life but I wouldnt be surprised if one of her friends mentioned it or something and now she\u2019s not good with it", "NTA \ud83d\udea9 dump that girl asap. She doesn\u2019t like you for you and she\u2019s emotionally and verbally abusive. Get out of there asap. You deserve better.", "NAH - you\u2019re both young and figuring out who you are.  You should date a person who is more comfortable with you dressing fem, she wants a partner who is more masc.

If someone if going to be in a relationship with you, then they need to want to be in a relationship with *you*, not some person they want to turn you into. It\u2019s one thing to make a suggestion they think you might like - it\u2019s another think to use emotional manipulation to force you to become someone you aren\u2019t in order to fit a fictional image they have in their head. \n\nShe claims you weren\u2019t being considerate of her feelings, but she was ignoring your entire identity. *She* was being far more selfish than you ever were. She was treating you as if you were some kind of doll that she could dress up the way she wanted as opposed to a person with an identity. And you deserve better than that.", "NTA. Get a better girlfriend, one who appreciate you for who YOU are.", "NAH. You want different things. So break up and find someone who finds how you want to dress attractive and let her find someone who dresses in a way she finds attractive.", "ESH\n\nHer obviously. You to yourself for trying to continue the relationship.", "NTA. But you need to understand its not what she's into. If she's straight she may be finding this a massive turnoff and she's not the one for you.", "Many women are turned off by effeminate men.  They want a masculine man.", "NAH. You are allowed to wear what you want to wear, and she is allowed to be attracted to what she is attracted to.

There are like 50000x the amount of masc dressing guys out there to femme it is an insane task to end up in this situation for her, also exceptionally horrible behaviour to try and change you. \n\nI'm goth and super alt, mega out there.
