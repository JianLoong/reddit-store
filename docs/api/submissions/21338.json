Just remember, only one life", "NTA! The most important thing you take from all of us responding to you is that we\u2019re telling you to RUN.. get the hell out of that relationship! Just by his actions or lack of in that one time outing are flags that if you had kids, you would be the only one doing the parenting. Ice cream shops are not only for families with kids. The fact he felt so entitled that he could allow those kids to run around and disturb others shows what an AH he is. The fact that he allowed his own child to run around and act out disturbing others shows you a pre-sign of what your kids would be like with him.", "People who let their kids run wild in public places are also known as \"Assholes\".

There are many places where they can run around and scream and just be joyful kids, but an ice-cream shop isn't one of them.\n\nNor should an adult have to tell them to put on their seatbelts more than once. Isn't it against the law to ride without one? What if law enforcement took notice? Would your BF like that option?\n\nHis resentment is a problem in itself.", "NTA, and I'm with everyone else telling you to get out now.  Your BF has just shown you that he'd rather inconvenience an entire room full of people than curb his children's unruly behavior.  And on top of THAT, you're not allowed to try to restore order either.  So not only will he not bother to discipline them (even for safety reasons) himself, but he's also not going to let anyone else do it.", "Sometimes reddit doesn't have the best concept of developmentally appropriate behavior from kids so here's an article that matches pretty closely to my own experience with my kids and niblings: \n\nhttps://www.babycenter.com/child/parenting-strategies/how-to-teach-your-child-to-behave-in-a-restaurant_10305072\n\nMy questions are - how long was the wait time at the first location? Did the kids have anything to distract them while they waited (like crayons or something?) Regardless, the boyfriend should have done some things differently: he should have set expectations prior to entering the ice cream shop (he doesn't have to be stern about it but at least explain waiting in line and remind them about indoor voices), and he should have been correcting their behavior in real time (again he doesn't have to be stern he can say \"oh your wandering off so hold my hand while we wait in line\"). Here's what you could have done differently: once you decided to leave the first place, that should have been it. The situation isn't going to improve by going to a second location because at that point they're even more impatient and squirrelly. Maybe ice cream from Walmart would have been okay at that point but IDK.\n\nWhat you should do now is probably break up with your BF.

And that's why you where really upset at children behaving like children for the duration of just waiting to get your ice cream and then just leaving??? \ud83d\ude12", "The thing that really got me was the older kid the 11 year old was the only person trying to keep the kids under control. I desperately wanted to intervene but none of the kids are mine or even related to me so I didn't want to overstep. Considering it still ended poorly maybe I should have.", "The bigger place was an outdoor ice cream parlor with a playground for the kids to play in while they waited for their ice cream. So they'd have an actual place to play and use that energy in a productive manner. I understand the excitement of ice cream and the fact that the kids were just being kids. My gripe was with my boyfriend's lack of action especially when it was clear that other people were effected by the kids behavior.", "Pls don't, it's a trap for you to get use to parenting his kids bc your bf doesn't want to do it."]}
