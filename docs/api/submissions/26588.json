My fianc\u00e9 comes from a big family, particularly on his dad\u2019s side. His dad is one of eight (including two step siblings) and his grandfather is one of ten. His father is also the only one of this siblings with a single child, so my fianc\u00e9 has no siblings of his own but a big number of cousins, some of which he\u2019s quite close to. The aunt mentioned above is mother to eight of his cousins and another one on the way.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided, after a long discussion, that our wedding ceremony and reception will be child-free. We don\u2019t want any interruptions, distraction, destruction, etc. This is meant to be our special day, and we\u2019ve both agreed that for us and our wedding, the best decision is to allow only those 18 and older to attend. It also keeps the attendance party smaller, which fits better with the budget and venue capacity. We decided that, in addition to this, we would host a family gather at my parents\u2019 home a week after the wedding that all the kids could attend so they could feel included in the celebration without fianc\u00e9 and I worrying about anything. This whole plan felt like a win-win.\n\nInvitations went out last week, specifying the event would be child-free and that there would be a family party a week later that would be all ages. Aunt calls fianc\u00e9 about the \u201cmistake on the invites\u201d. He tells her it\u2019s not a mistake. She asks if it applies to her. He says it does. She fights him on it. He stays firm. And then she gives the most bullshit response I\u2019ve ever heard. She tells my fianc\u00e9 that because the wedding is \u201cchild-free\u201d none of her children will be coming except the one in her womb. She says that all of her sweet babies that love him so much, including her oldest (19M) will be staying at home instead of celebrating his wedding with him. Fianc\u00e9 asks what she means since said cousin is meant to be one of his groomsmen, and she goes off on him about how she can\u2019t afford a sitter to watch seven kids and that it isn\u2019t fair that they get left out while the eldest is included, and even if she could afford a sitter, she isn\u2019t going to trust some stranger with her kids. My fianc\u00e9 hung up before she could rant any more, but she\u2019s been blowing up our phones since then.\n\nThe only thing that has us questioning if we might be assholes is fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin texting him about the whole mess and asking if we\u2019d just allow kids at the wedding so he can still be in it and won\u2019t have to babysit. We feel bad for him, and we want him in our wedding, but we don\u2019t want children there. And if we just make an exception for aunt\u2019s children but no one else\u2019s well piss everyone else off. But if we allow everyone to bring their kids we\u2019ll be miserable. Are we assholes here? Should we just suck it up?\n\nEdit: For clarification, aunts kids are 19M, 15M, 13M, 12F, 9M&F (fraternal twins), 5F, and 3M. And of course the baby on the way, which they\u2019re going to have a gender reveal party for once she\u2019s 8 months along. She\u2019s three months along right now.", "created_utc": 1694355586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f1g9c/aita_making_my_future_inlaw_babysit_his_siblings/", "score": 465, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The 15 year old can babysit..that\u2019s typical babysitting Age.  I mean come on, most kids don\u2019t care about weddings anyway.  She\u2019s being unreasonable and selfish.  The other option, she attends the wedding and skips the reception to attend to her children.  Using her 19 year old like this smacks of emotional blackmail here.

Ie, invite all siblings and first cousins, even though some are children, invite no friends' kids, invite no cousins' kids, etc instead of just some arbitrary age line. Then you avoid the hurt feelings and drama that comes with splitting up siblings).\n\nYour aunt's concern about childcare is valid and one that any host that chooses not to invite children needs to take into consideration and steel themselves for the reality that some people with kids might decline.\n\nWhat gets me though, is why 19m can't come alone to the wedding and *aunt* stay with the kids. I assume it's a spiteful thing so she can punish you guys but I think it's goofy as heck that really, it's also punishing her son (not only is he excluded from a wedding he may have wanted to go to, but also he's stuck babysitting). Is fiance's parent that's sibling to this aunt still alive? What do they think of the situation. Think they'd be willing to whisper into her ear that maybe she should send the son instead?\n\nY W B T A to make an exception for just her kids, because you're right that it's not fair to anyone else. The one way it would be \"fair\" is if they fall in the above mentioned circle. If you have no other first cousins that are minors, you wouldn't need to invite other kids. People generally understand that sort of thing (though it's made difficult if you plastered \"no children!\" on the invites but oh well). But it wouldn't solve the problem of your not wanting kids there regardless so may not help you much.

If you can't afford to hire a baby sitter for one event you can't afford 7 kids and counting.\n\nI would reach out ti the 19 yo to stay as groomsman although he'll probably catch it from his mom so don't be surprised if she pressures him. Heck, she could hire an adult and give the 15 yo a couple of extra dollars to help out.\n\nChild free weddings are pretty common so her reaction is as extra special ridiculous as she is extra special.

She says that all of her sweet babies that love him so much, including her oldest (19M) will be staying at home instead of celebrating his wedding with him.* Sure, because everyone knows how much 13, 12 and 9 year old kids LOVE weddings.

Plus it's your wedding and you set the rules. Your cousins situation is bad but being an adult means making difficult decisions. It's not his responsibility to look after his mom's children and it's upto him to decide if he wants to capitulate to his mom's demands or show up at the wedding. Just tell him you feel bad for him and support his decision either way but can't make an exception.", "NTA!!! Your Aunt is 100%. Aunt should stay back at her home and take care of her children, if she really wanna go, she can hire a sitter or perhaps someone close.

There's something wrong there. Uninvite the aunt. She's going to be a problem and would be better if removed now. Let the other family know the situation before she begins spreading her side.

The temptation, of course, will be to uninvite \"auntie\" in favor of her son being a groomsman, but I suspect she'll simply not allow her son to attend.  Yes he's an adult, but if he's living in her home and she's supporting him that gives her considerable power over his actions. \n\nInstead tell auntie that because of the limits with the venue it's simply not possible to accommodate children under 18-- and of course if you were to include her children then it would be a slap in the face to other's who wanted to bring their children as well.

You are making no exceptions. AND, to top it all off you are having a part later for everyone including kids to celebrate.

This is why you\u2019re having the second party!  Your reasons are all totally justifiable. You don\u2019t owe her anything. As you said, this is a special day for you and your fianc\u00e9.

My fianc\u00e9 comes from a big family, particularly on his dad\u2019s side. His dad is one of eight (including two step siblings) and his grandfather is one of ten. His father is also the only one of this siblings with a single child, so my fianc\u00e9 has no siblings of his own but a big number of cousins, some of which he\u2019s quite close to. The aunt mentioned above is mother to eight of his cousins and another one on the way.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided, after a long discussion, that our wedding ceremony and reception will be child-free. We don\u2019t want any interruptions, distraction, destruction, etc. This is meant to be our special day, and we\u2019ve both agreed that for us and our wedding, the best decision is to allow only those 18 and older to attend. It also keeps the attendance party smaller, which fits better with the budget and venue capacity. We decided that, in addition to this, we would host a family gather at my parents\u2019 home a week after the wedding that all the kids could attend so they could feel included in the celebration without fianc\u00e9 and I worrying about anything. This whole plan felt like a win-win.\n\nInvitations went out last week, specifying the event would be child-free and that there would be a family party a week later that would be all ages. Aunt calls fianc\u00e9 about the \u201cmistake on the invites\u201d. He tells her it\u2019s not a mistake. She asks if it applies to her. He says it does. She fights him on it. He stays firm. And then she gives the most bullshit response I\u2019ve ever heard. She tells my fianc\u00e9 that because the wedding is \u201cchild-free\u201d none of her children will be coming except the one in her womb. She says that all of her sweet babies that love him so much, including her oldest (19M) will be staying at home instead of celebrating his wedding with him.
