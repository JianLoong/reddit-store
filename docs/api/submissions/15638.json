Def lawyer, so that was her way of scaring me straight, even though I had never touched a drug, drank alcohol, went out with friends, broke curfew, got in trouble at school, etc).

It's her job to make sure you get to school on time and are taken care of. She dropped the ball big time, and then was abusive about it.

I was such a ppl pleaser most of my life, kept family in my life regardless of the wrongs they\u2019ve done to me up until recently! And when I tell you it was the best dam thing I have EVER done!!! Sooooo much less stress, less drama and some dam peace for once!!!", "When I was kid there were times when i needed money for randomly something mostly outside food. My parents used to stock up the kitchen but there were times when i needed something different I used to go and just take from my parents wallet. It wasn\u2019t too much hardly a dollar and the occurrence of it was maybe 2 time a month and i would let them know and share my stuff with everyone in the family but never have they ever shouted on me and they would just go and bring more of that items. I am telling you this because the situation i gave is not important and having money wasn\u2019t a need whereas in your case you needed it for your fare. You mother is abusive no parents in their right state of mind would ever react that way. My parents didn\u2019t even scold me because they knew me.", "NTA. OP, your mother is abusive. It's time to go LC or NC with her. She doesn't deserve you and never has.", "NTA\n\nYour mom absolutely sucks\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her any of your time", "This woman had you arrested at 13 when you took money for busfare after she forget to get you a new ticket?  And you still have a relationship with her?  You must be the most forgiving person on earth.\n\nAnd now she's accusing you of stealing money and calling your hurtful names?  This is abusive and you don't deserve it.  Of course you left!  I think you're very wise to celebrate your birthday with people who treat you with kindness and respect -- your mom doesn't qualify.  She owes you an apology.  And you owe her very LC or NC.  I promise that you'll be far happier in a life that doesn't include her abuse.\n\nNTA", "NTA You\u2019ve got yourself a narcissist parent.", "Terrible mom. NTA", "OP, leaving your mother\u2019s house was a form of self-care. NTA (and yes, go back to therapy. You were traumatized repeatedly as a child).", "NTA", "NTA and your mom is horrible for calling the police on you, that\u2019s abusive", "NTA she had you arrested for bus ticket money", "NTA... I hope your in therapy, hon. Not every parent calls the cops on their kids, but every kid who's had the cops called on them by their parents needs therapy now.", "Right?! Who does that ?", "I'm so sorry this triggered you. There is so much my mother has done that just on its own would make people go what the heck.\nI hope your in a better place than 17 year old you. X", "Makes me wonder if she was trying to sabotage your test. Did she ever express stuff about you having to live with them for long time/not being able to 'survive on your own', that you 'owe them' or anything like that?", "Classic \u201c cycle of abuse\u201d. It\u2019s an emotional roller coaster no one should be forced to ride.", "Hi. I do this too. I just nixed birthdays. They honestly just remind me of all the hurt. And milestones generally. After this kind of treatment it can be really hard to make friends. Because any slip and my walls go up which I know isn\u2019t fair to them. It\u2019s difficult. But I do find the more I get out and pursue hobbies that get me out of the house, the more friends I make, even if I just keep them casual. \n\nBut making a chosen friend group is another thing your therapist can help with!!! I might transition to that focus with mine now I\u2019ve been in for 4 years and have worked through a lot of the childhood stuff.", "The fact she launched the attention seeking accusation makes me think she\u2019s projecting and set you up or at least blew it up out of proportion for attention.", "Get your money that is yours\n\nShe uses your childhood savings account like a piggy bank, but called the police on you because you took bus fare when you were 13?", "No just that I was stupid (I'm dyslexic) she told me a lot that if I didn't get my act together she would kick me out at 16 (I used to skip school alot)", "Thank you for this. Knowing its possible for others to do this gives me hope thag it will be possible for to do it", "i have a 5 month old, and while i know thats not the same as a 13 year old, she already owns my bank account. any money i have will go straight on her if she needs anything, even if i only have enough for formula or just a cheap pack of nappies(diapers), i will happily go into debt if she needs something thats going to keep her happy and safe and dry. your mother is an abusive asshole, like sure if my kid was 13 and took some money i was meant to give her then id probably playfully tease her about nicking it but i couldnt DREAM of calling the police on her unless there was an actual reason to.", "r/raisedbynarcissists", "I would have gone without food for myself to pay for my child's bus fare. No questions, no hesitation.", "Yes even then! She had her 13 year old arrested! For taking the bus fare she was supposed to give her child!  Please... Go no contact because I'm sure she does other crap like this.", "Thank you. Sometimes I really long to hear these things. That im doing okay and that the achievements I have are good enough for people to be proud of me for. I'm proud of myself for getting here.", "I relate to you OP. My mother has been upset with me for well over 30 years and brings it up often even though I was 12 years old. I have had enough and no longer talk to her. I\u2019m tired of being abused by her. In fact, she complained about having to change my diaper as a baby.", "Friendly reminder you owe NOTHING to people who treat you like this. Not your time, your love, your attention, not any space in your life. \n\nYou sound awesome and like a very determined, resourceful, kind, and funny person with vast patience. Just from this thread I can tell that. From one who\u2019s walked in similar shoes: remember every bit of you they get is their privilege and you should be treated as such. Walk into their company eyes open, head high, and on your terms. If they can\u2019t abide by that, they\u2019re not worthy of you.", "I used to love that movie and the book as it made me feel less alone. I think it's why I befriended teachers so much as a child.", "Makes me think they were like minded friends of hers. Legal abuse and wasting public resources. I can totally see them being in on it."]}
