Def lawyer, so that was her way of scaring me straight, even though I had never touched a drug, drank alcohol, went out with friends, broke curfew, got in trouble at school, etc).

It's her job to make sure you get to school on time and are taken care of. She dropped the ball big time, and then was abusive about it.

Don't feel any kind of guilt please.", "Yes! It wasn\u2019t your fault.", "the fact that you had to ask this breaks my heart", "Parents are supposed to take care of their children. \n\nThis is abuse.", "Yeah definitely. My family grew up struggling constantly but no matter what all the necessities were taken care of by mum even if that meant going without on other things. Bus money for your education  is 100% a necessity. Hate to be rude but your mother sounds absolutely horrendous and I\u2019m sorry you grew up with that. She literally was calling you names and screaming at you on your birthday at 28 years of age \n\nI hope you were able to turn your day around and celebrate your birthday even a little bit mate", "That you have to ask this--look, get yourself into therapy if you can and cut this woman out of your life. That is not how a mother behaves. You are being abused. NTA.", "Yes. Your mother is awful.\nEven my very last $3 would be okay to take if it meant my daughter would get to school and take her test without having to walk.\nWe\u2019d be hitting the food bank and calling our bill companies for payment plans but we would NOT be calling the police.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth my mother called the police on me when I was around a similar age a few times and it messed me up a bit.", "Poor mom of a 14yo girl.... I have 1 pair of shoes to my name with holes in them because she needed pants.\n\nYour mom sucks.", "Especially if you were struggling to afford it love. A childs education isnt something you can half ass. I'm so sorry that happened. Happy late birthday \ud83c\udf82", "Yup, I did this and it was so freeing. OP, you need to make this happen.", "Apparently when I was in the bassinet in the hospital, I cried whenever I saw her come in the room. She (naturally) took as a solid sign that I hated her, so she took to crawling past me on her hands and knees to avoid me crying \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI brushed it off for years as one of those stories she told, but I eventually snapped at her at the fact it was ridiculous to blame me for something that happened when I had literally *just been born* and wasn\u2019t even 5 days old. She tried clinging to it for a bit, but I just kept telling her how ridiculous it sounded to blame a literal baby. \n\nIn fairness, she did worse, but it\u2019s all good now. She had a health scare a while ago that showed her how GC looked after her vs. lil ole me and funnily enough she\u2019s more balanced these days \ud83d\ude09", "I partly get the culture thing there are some cultures that prioritise boys and there needs and wants.", "Exactly my point. In what culture will the police act on that?\n\nTo me, this is horrific. But this response is clearly normal, or at least normal enough that a parent can do this and *not* be in the wrong *in their culture*.", "Wow. So much to unpack there! Just telling the story when you were born necessarily implies a ton of crap you must have had to endure after that. Sorry you were mistreated like that from someone who is supposed to be one\u2019s primary caregiver. \n\nThe horror of having to apologize for crying as a 2-day-old child.", "I feel that a lot of the things you have described go beyond what even those cultures could consider acceptable to do to your children.\n\nWhere do you live anyway?", "There is a law that children ove the age of 11 have criminal responsability which basically means they know right from wrong so can be arrested for doing wrong.", "Again, in what culture is this \u201cnormal\u201d?", "I went through alot of other stuff alot of it I have untangled with counselling but I think I'm going ti go back and work through this with a counselor and the feelings which have been brought up. We actually were known to child protective services when I was a kid but nothing happened.", "Lol - who says I apologised? I was stubborn from the get go. \n\nThank you for your well wishes though; hope you\u2019re doing well too.", "Exactly why I asked!", "There were alot of weird punishments which is why I started lying. I used to love to read and when I couldn't sleep I would read by the light from the streetlight outside my window. I got told off many times ans eventually she confiscated a load of books and threatened to burn them. I was alway losing my pocket money mostly for not liking the food I have a texture issue I dont like a few things but it wasn't bad it was simply that I liked mash potatoes instead of new potatoes and that I didn't like lentels there were times I had to sit at the table Intill bed time.", "I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t make my question clear, that\u2019s my bad.\n\nI am asking for you to tell me a culture, any culture that is shared by a  large group of people, such as a country or notable geographic area where it is acceptable to allow your older child to physically abuse your younger child or to tell them that you wish you had aborted them.\n\nDoesn\u2019t even have to be op\u2019s culture, just any where no one would bat an eye at that."]}
