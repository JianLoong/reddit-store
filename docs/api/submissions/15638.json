You hardly stole and made a mistake as a young kid, just trying to get to school!  You mom is TA if she is going to hang that over your head 15 years later.

She seemingly is so focused on you, so sure that it was you again who took the note that she cannot fathom ANYONE else taking it.  \nYou were fully in your right to leave the house, because no matter what you could say or do, she probably would still find a way where you are at fault.\n\nHonestly the time she had you ARRESTED, even if it was just to scare you or teach you a lesson, was quite unhinged already if you ask me.\n\nI hope the relationship improves eventually and wish you lots of strength in the mean time!", "NTA. \n\nSounds like mom was in over her head, and rather than admit she made a mistake by forgetting the bus ticket, she went nuclear on you.", "NTA- f that noise", "Who else was in the house?

I don't think you're the AH here and it sounds like you weren't back then either so I don't see how a mistake was made by you when you were younger.  You had given her the notice for the bus $ but it sounds like she gave your brother the \"credit\" for the notice marked on the calendar.  Either way, that was dealt with (quite harshly if you ask me) and what happened years ago shouldn't be weaponized to use at whim.   I think I would have left too, no one wants to spend their birthday in a toxic-feeling environment.   I hope you were able to do something nice for yourself, happy belated birthday.", "NTA.

I was lucky my teachers liked me and I got over 90% in the biology paper and over 80% in the chemistry paper. I walked so many times and there was no pavement so I would ha e to walk on the road with bends you couldn't see around. Some of my brothers friends even gave me the last trip inn there ticket for me to use and a lot of the drivers would just pretend to stamp my ticket. I walked in the snow and had to climb over fences in farmers fiends and got chased my sheep a few times and had a stand off with a bull once.

I am looking at going low contact with her.", "To be honest I did used to take the occasional quid and buy sweets because we were not allowed themand all my friends had them and she would stop my pocket money for stupid reasons like reading for to long.

Sorry I forgot\"", "This is heartbreaking and please understand this is not normal that she treated you like this", "Honey, you spelled \"no contact\" wrong. \n\nI'm sorry your mom sucks. You deserve better.", "She is definitely playing favorites. Think about your relationship with your mom and if you want this kind of person in your life", "Honestly, I can see a little logic there for your mom to suspect you but it was 15 YEARS AGO. I think you are especially in your right to ask her why she thinks after 15 years you haven't improved or been not trustworthy in this regard?\n\nDepending on her answer she may reveal other issues or actually will have to justify her behavior.  \nThe same reasoning, that you felt quite offended but especially unrespected without any legit reason for it made you leave her house.

Sometimes I need to hear this", "Honestly I'm starting to wonder that. I o ce stayed for the weekend did a load of odd jobs for her and got a lovely text of thank you and how wo derfull I was and I sent a text back saying how lovely it had been to stay for a few days and thank you for having me thought that visit went really well, less than 12 hours later I get a message calling me scum and a load of other names because I had left my bin in my room and not emptied it when I left.", "She told me I either took it for attention or because I mowed the lawn and joked that not I'm an adult she doesn't need to pay me for helping her out with that.

I just laughed and told her she was being rediculace.", "I litraly said to her before that she got divorced due to the stuff he did and then she goes and does simular stuff to me why do I have to put up with it as an adult when she didn't.

But I'm realising lately I need to raise myself.\nThank you for the birthday wishes it means alot.", "yes!!! your mother is awful", "Grew up poor. My mom would never have got me arrested over taking bus fare. I'm guessing your brother can do no wrong and your the cause of all the family/your mothers problems.... pretty common in narcissistic parents I'm afraid", "Yes. Absolutely.", "Yes, being poor doesn't mean you can be cruel or neglectful to kids.", "As you rightfully should. She is acting ridiculous in this situation.\n\nAttention? yeah sure, you a 28 yo person are looking for attention, especially for something like that, yes makes total sense.\n\nHope she gets back to her senses and normality soon!", "He got cut off after a while when family found out some of th things he did to me and also for how he treated my grandma. My revenge for him was just waiting a few years."]}
