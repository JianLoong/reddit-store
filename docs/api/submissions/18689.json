My parents have been trying to destroy and control my life. They contacted everyone close to me, trying to get info about me. I noticed getting photographed by random people every time I was stepping outside. A guy I know tried to date me at some point, but I felt something was off. I found out later he had been collaborating with my parents to gather information about me.\n\nI've discovered a keylogger on my computer and I think it was used to know where I would apply. I've had strange interviews where the recruiter asked weird questions about me, my family or my friends, and my opinions on firearms, tobacco, and drugs. I lost good job prospects for no reason whatsoever. My home was sometimes broken into while I was in an interview.\n\nThis is just to describe how far my parents have gone to try to control my life. They have the means to make it happen.\n\nI have a hard time opening up to relationships overall. I've had a boyfriend for about a year. At first I wasn't sure I wanted a relationship. He wasn't ready for a relationship either. I told him towards the beginning I was considering leaving the relationship once I got a job and explained I wanted to be able to move away from the grip of my family. He knows the situation with my family. I didn't want him to feel too invested or attached in the relationship if this was to happen. He took it badly, kept bringing it up on and on for months on end, saying no one does this kind of thing.\n\nI reflected on it. Over a few months, I changed. I wanted to make it work past all this.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to open up to him. One day (a few months ago), I asked \"Are you spying for my parents?\". I felt ready to ask the question. He got offended by it and berated me.\n\nThe latest fight like that was yesterday. I had a weird feeling from our previous talk, and I was wondering if he was recording us while we were talking online. So I said \"Are you recording me?\" He got offended and asked \"Why are you asking me that?\" I replied \"I had a weird feeling from our last talk and I would like to know if you have been recording me.\" He got so mad at me, he told me \"you cannot treat a relationship like this\" \"how can you accuse me of such a thing?\" \"this is illegal and you would accuse me of that\". I tried to explain there was no accusation, I just wanted to know if he was doing so because I didn't feel comfortable with it. He kept telling me \"it is wrong\" \"you are mean\" \"there is no relationship if you treat me like that\", said he couldn't stand me treating him like this and told me to \"ask about it on r/amitheasshole and write AITA for asking if he was spying on me for my parents or if he was recording me?\" He says \"questions have an implication\" and \"I cannot possibly imagine that this is okay in any relationship\".\n\nSo am I the AH if I ask questions like are you spying on me for my parents or are you recording me?", "created_utc": 1685612599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xd6ip/aita_for_asking_my_bf_if_he_is_spying_for_my/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Breaking into my home has been done very efficiently, it was not for stealing but I noticed that my documents were searched through and my papers were not stacked like I used to. There was this one guy who seemed interested, but I felt that it was off. Turns out that he has been the one attempting to deactivate the camera inside every time he visited me. There was one recruiter who essentially passed false info to other recruiters about me. Another recruiter then took me in for an interview which did not really seem like an interview with weird questions and my home was broken into in the meantime. There is more. I kept track of plate numbers and I have been securing my belongings but I know that my parents have a lot to lose and I don't want to end up under their influence ever.\n\nEDIT: I also found a tracker in my belongings several times. Sadly, I did not have enough brain to think that keeping them at home before depositing them to the police would be a bad idea, given that someone can break into so easily.\n\nEDIT: The group of people is not so large but it is clear that they are all connected one to another.", "Why does this feel like a beautiful mind but instead of Nazis it is OPs parents behind every door as the lurking villain.", "Meh, didn't seem evasive, sounded like he was confused, and gave an expected reaction to be accused of dating someone to record them and pass it on to her parents.\n\nHe could be nicer and realize she's got some kind of heightened paranoia because of trauma.

I'm sorry but this sounds way too out there. Even if they knew where she applied, who would go along with it?", "None. But they have been looking for ways to control me and I found the questions weird. I have no history with drug abuse whatsoever and I refuse coffee because I know that I tend to get easily addicted to it after a few days.\n\nMy instincts told me that he was not connected to my parents. That is how it felt. I trust my instincts on this. However, I had the feeling that he was angry at me and hurtful sometimes on purpose and I was wondering if he was trying to record me in an attempt to tell people that I was crazy. One of the reasons I had a weird feeling over the recording last time was that he usually never apologizes for anything he does in the relationship, I usually wait for him to calm down, but last time, he suddenly gave a full apology and truly analyzed his behavior. I thought that it was a good thing but it felt like he had recorded it or something. I just wanted to bring up the recording part so that we were on the same page. I did not feel comfortable with the idea that he could record me and I thought it would be better to ask than keep it quiet and shut.", "All of these are one time instances. Everything that happened I described it. He is more upset about the overall mindset that apparently I don't trust him.\n\nEDIT: I am reflecting on your additional questions. It is just that I don't really doubt him, it is usually over minor points that I want to get clarified. At the beginning of the relationship, we tried to discuss how we could make some kind of revenue together and I wanted it to be fair and made an offer that he outright refused. I was hurt by the refusal because I thought that the offer was fair. But he said he refused because the offer was unfair. It took a while before finding out that the offer was unfair to me and that he did not mean that it was unfair to him. \n\nAnyway the bad communication was not solved and the issue itself was never solved.", "Can you explain? I want to understand him.", "I don't accuse him. I try to explain where I come from and I am always careful that it is a question and not an outright accusation. \"Are you ...? \" vs \"You are ....\"", "I have feeling he's been hiding something in relation to his family.

This is pure speculation at this point.\n\nI don't have reasons yet to think that he is doing something in connection with my family.", "I don't have any reasons to think that he is in on it at the time. All I know is that he has been angry and off with me lately. And I think that there must be something that has been ongoing with his family to cause him to act like this. This is pure speculation, but I thought that it would be better to express it than keep it in.", "My instincts can be wrong at times and I prefer to talk about what is going on than keep it to myself.

What do I have to do?", "The very nature of delusion is that it is a fixed belief that cannot be challenged, but from an outsiders perspective what you are describing does not sound like it is genuinely happening.\n\nIf you wanted to get help, I would discuss your concerns with a healthcare provider.", "\u201cA weird feeling\u201d is not data, my friend.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re delusional, but that your parents have caused paranoia.

Do seek help though. It\u2019ll help you. I would recommend not telling anyone that you\u2019re seeking help as you might start to suspect that the shrink is also hired by your parents. If it is feasible for you, move countries", "It seems to be more like real people getting false info but I am not sure. I don't want to explain more, criminal investigation is ongoing and as far as I know several people have been let go of their jobs because of what they have done.", "What country do you live in?", "Do you think so? Can you explain why?", "I suspect that the questions were asked in relation first to where I would be interested in working (tobacco, firearms, or drug development), but it just seemed a bit weird. The weird feeling really came when I got home and noticed that my belongings had been searched.", "Hmm from your comments and edit it seems more like miscommunication than anything else. I still think therapy could help you live with your trauma, maybe if he agree your boyfriend could come with you (not for a couple therapy, just to help you with your own)\n\nMore than anything else you need to learn to trust. You say it's not that you don't trust him, and I'm sure you really believe it, but deep down what your actions show is that, in the end, you suspect him and don't believe in him when he deny your accusations. This shows that you don't actually trust him, which again, is understandable but not okay.", "Sorry, but there's actually no difference there. 'Are you spying for my parents' means you think he could be, which means you're questioning his integrity. You can't say it's just a question, is the confirmation that you think he could be that kind of person. \n\nBeing upset about being asked that is not suspicious. I think you sound incredibly paranoid and that you need help.", "Therapy is a good start. I'm not trying to be a dick but I've read this thread, and either way you got a problem.", "Ok. I will reflect what you tell me.", "I did challenge my thoughts several times. I usually try to double check my data. If I have a plate number for example, and I notice someone taking a photo of me while I walk past, I try to request info about the address associated with it so that I decide, \"oh this person just lives close by, he probably just took a photo\" vs \"wait, isn't this the PI office that was hired a while back?\"", "It is true that a weird feeling is not data. It just means that investigating could be good. That is why I asked him the question. Should I have not asked anything and not mentioned this ever?", "Why do you ask?", "Have you seen the movie?", "What should I do then in regards to this? Are you telling me that I should not speak about this type of issues in general in a relationship?", "I feel like I should just say,it's super unlikely that your parents got to job interviewers to spy on you. There is no way a manager looking to hire would go along with it.\n\nThat's just the most obvious fault I see.\n\nAlso accusing your boyfriend of that is pretty shitty.

That\u2019s why u/normalmeatbasedhuman suggested getting help. It\u2019s not your fault that you feel this way, but if your boyfriend is innocent, it\u2019s not fair to him that you frequently question him and his motives. Relationships require trust. If you feel you can\u2019t trust a partner, then you need to work on yourself and your situation. Sometimes you can do that along with a partner, sometimes you can\u2019t.", "Get the evaluation from a trained professional. At worst, perhaps there's a chemical imbalance. At best you now have a professional saying you're NOT jumping at shadows to back you up. Go into it honestly and openly: your family may be awful and it possibly gave you some form of PSTD. If your boyfriend IS innocent it's not fair to either of you to be constantly hounding him and is a good way to get an ex instead of a supporting partner.", "Lol if \"my bf is spying on me for my parents\" is a common problem, maybe stay single.."]}
