I found out later he had been collaborating with my parents to gather information about me.\n\nI've discovered a keylogger on my computer and I think it was used to know where I would apply.

I wanted to make it work past all this.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to open up to him. One day (a few months ago), I asked \"Are you spying for my parents?\". I felt ready to ask the question. He got offended by it and berated me.\n\nThe latest fight like that was yesterday. I had a weird feeling from our previous talk, and I was wondering if he was recording us while we were talking online. So I said \"Are you recording me?\" He got offended and asked \"Why are you asking me that?\" I replied \"I had a weird feeling from our last talk and I would like to know if you have been recording me.\" He got so mad at me, he told me \"you cannot treat a relationship like this\" \"how can you accuse me of such a thing?\" \"this is illegal and you would accuse me of that\". I tried to explain there was no accusation, I just wanted to know if he was doing so because I didn't feel comfortable with it. He kept telling me \"it is wrong\" \"you are mean\" \"there is no relationship if you treat me like that\", said he couldn't stand me treating him like this and told me to \"ask about it on r/amitheasshole and write AITA for asking if he was spying on me for my parents or if he was recording me?\" He says \"questions have an implication\" and \"I cannot possibly imagine that this is okay in any relationship\".\n\nSo am I the AH if I ask questions like are you spying on me for my parents or are you recording me?", "created_utc": 1685612599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xd6ip/aita_for_asking_my_bf_if_he_is_spying_for_my/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was one recruiter who essentially passed false info to other recruiters about me. Another recruiter then took me in for an interview which did not really seem like an interview with weird questions and my home was broken into in the meantime. There is more.

That is how it felt. I trust my instincts on this. However, I had the feeling that he was angry at me and hurtful sometimes on purpose and I was wondering if he was trying to record me in an attempt to tell people that I was crazy. One of the reasons I had a weird feeling over the recording last time was that he usually never apologizes for anything he does in the relationship, I usually wait for him to calm down, but last time, he suddenly gave a full apology and truly analyzed his behavior. I thought that it was a good thing but it felt like he had recorded it or something. I just wanted to bring up the recording part so that we were on the same page. I did not feel comfortable with the idea that he could record me and I thought it would be better to ask than keep it quiet and shut.", "All of these are one time instances. Everything that happened I described it. He is more upset about the overall mindset that apparently I don't trust him.\n\nEDIT: I am reflecting on your additional questions. It is just that I don't really doubt him, it is usually over minor points that I want to get clarified. At the beginning of the relationship, we tried to discuss how we could make some kind of revenue together and I wanted it to be fair and made an offer that he outright refused. I was hurt by the refusal because I thought that the offer was fair. But he said he refused because the offer was unfair. It took a while before finding out that the offer was unfair to me and that he did not mean that it was unfair to him. \n\nAnyway the bad communication was not solved and the issue itself was never solved.", "Can you explain?

An actual functioning relationship is not one where an adult asks another adult if they are wearing a wire to report back to someone\u2019s mommy.

He's totally right to be offended by the question as you are questioning the authenticity of his feelings towards you. I'm not a psychologist or a doctor, but it really seems like you are extremely paranoid about your parents and are overestimating their influence on your life. Unless your parents are extraordinarily wealthy and powerful, it's very doubtful that they could sway that many job prospects away from you. Could it be that your behavior threw off interviewers? It is very unusual that you have replied to so many comments on this thread, replies to almost everyone trying to justify your behavior and show people that you're not paranoid.

Let's say that your parents did spy on you. That has nothing to do with your partner. Even if there was a real reason, by now you seem to be paranoid.

Asking him those questions is judging him for your fears.\n\nYou should definitely seek psychological help.", "Ok. Since you would like more info.\n\nMy parents seem to have beef with me. It was an abusive household and I hated it. They divorced when I was young and since then they have been breaking up and getting back together and breaking and getting back together all the time. It looks like it is all about me, and honestly, I stopped keeping track of all the stuff they said to each other, justifying it in connection to me.\n\nI remember that I complained because one of my parents send over a PI in an attempt to coerce me to say that the other parent had an affair. I hated it. It just left lasting scars because since I was a child he coerced me by saying he would tell everyone at school I am a liar and then the other kids at school started to say that the big guy said I was a liar. If one of my parents could prove the affair, then the rules of divorce were different and it meant different court results.\n\nIt was abusive, lots of physical abuse. I tried to graduate from high school early to get out of there, as soon as I could. I entered university rather young. I hoped I could leave home then but my plan did not work out and I was stuck at home until I was 18. One day, I had a fight with my parent and I told them that I would leave there whenever I could and I would never come back. I asked my parents to authorize emancipation. I think it was a mistake.\n\nLater that year, I constantly fell asleep all the time for no reason. I knew that it was difficult for me and I was studying a lot but I could not understand it. My grades suffered a lot. Once, I told my parent that I fell asleep during an exam but managed to finish it. And they reacted by saying \"Oh, I gave you the wrong box of food.\" I reacted by asking \"What does food have anything to do with this?\" Many small things like that happened. I remember also once where my parent did not want me to go to a meeting and told me to eat first. After eating, I tried to change myself for the meeting but I felt so tired, I fell asleep right then. I have no memories of getting into bed. There are many more small things like this. I used to complain a lot about the taste of food.\n\nI found in the newspaper that the pharmacist my parents got their supply from was arrested for providing medications without a doctor's note. I saw him a few years back in another pharmacy before he was arrested and he strangely recognized my name and asked about my parent. I remember having a weird feeling and I kept his name. Indeed, he has been arrested later. It was that guy.\n\nIt took me longer to graduate. I had my own mess ups as well during my time in uni. But what happened essentially destroyed my self-confidence and coupled with a few other bad experiences, I can say there is some trauma.\n\nThe last straw came a few years back. My bf knows that something horrible happened but that is all he knows. I decided that I would never see, talk or hear about my parents again without a lawyer or protection present.\n\nAbout a month later, I had an unrelated accident and panicked a little. I called my parents to ask about getting a good doctor for the situation I was in. At the same time, I reached out to my contacts and was offered another doctor. In the end, I picked the doctor from my contacts. When I announced this to my parents, they blew out on the phone. They said that they \"would ruin my life\" and that \"they would sue me\" and \"control my finances and my choices\".\n\nAnd they did sue me. I never talked to them again except that one time in court. The experience left me really hurt and frankly, traumatized. The lawsuit was eventually thrown out, but I was left thinking that it could happen anytime and I started to think about escaping this.\n\nIt is in this context that I met my bf, about a year after that. I was finishing my degree and hoping to get a job soon. The getting the job part did not work out as well as I hoped but I keep applying and I had hopes my situation would resolve soon.", "Why do you think I do not respect him?", " Why is gangstalking always a sign of mental illness?

In terms of mental illness, the only thing I know of is that 2 doctors told me I had some form of depression at the time I consulted them. I was never told about anything else.", "I do not think that they swayed many job prospects. But finding a keylogger changed me a little bit.\n\nI think that I am stressed and scared and many of my applications have been rejected by interviewers themselves without any connection to my parents.\n\nAt most 10 job prospects (out of 200) have been lost in this way. What was more concerning was that they used one interviewer to gather information about me and my home was broken into while I was at interview.\n\nIt made me afraid. I was thinking about how to reduce the amount of data I give during a job interview and I don't think that it was good for me to be so scared.\n\nThroughout my life, people have told me to trust my parents but I never did. Being told me that what I said is not true is a big deal for me, given the amount of gaslighting I went through with my family.", "> far top defensive\n\nWhat a stupid and shameful excuse to blame someone \n\nIf someone asked if you molested their 4 year old daughter you would become extremely \u201cDefensive\u201d, I guess that must mean you did it in your logic.", "> far top defensive\n\nWhat a stupid and shameful excuse to blame someone \n\nIf someone asked if you molested their 4 year old daughter you would become extremely \u201cDefensive\u201d, I guess that must mean you did it in your logic.", "I didn\u2019t realize he was supposed to read her mind", "Yea she should definitely leave for his own good mental health\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "\u201cMy mistake.

However, you are letting paranoid rule you, and it will destroy this and every relationship you have if you do not seek therapy and work on yourself. People can understand where you're coming from whilst also being hurt and upset that you'd accuse them. \n\nImagine your bf had a partner that was a serial cheat, and he had trauma from that relationship. He then gets into a relationship with you, and because he feels something is going on, he accuses you of cheating. He then accuses you of texting other people. That meeting you had? It was a clandestine meeting with your affair partner.

This seems to be a snapshot into your relationship, and it sucks to be accused of doing things you're not. You're NTA for asking, but you kind of are an AH both to yourself and others for not seeking help to heal from the wounds your family has caused.

You both deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship and in life in general. Right now, you see danger everywhere, and you may be right about certain things, but with others, it's literally that your instincts are constantly on high alert. \n\nUltimately, if you cannot trust your bf, then you need to break up.

I will take more time to reflect on it.\n\nI don't suspect him. I suspect that something has happened after my boyfriend told me he did not want to tell his parents that we were in a relationship.

Your relationship right now is not OK or sustainable for either of you. \n\nThat said, and while I'm not questioning the legitimacy of anything you say you've experienced, you do need to look at receiving individual support from a therapist or something.
