It\u2019s seems like your sister earned that title, hope you\u2019re still on good terms with her! Also, that phone call she left you is totally manipulative.

Usually it's Tylenol or Advil.  There are a few rare conditions aspirin is used for, but because it can cause Reyes syndrome almost no one would tell you to use it for a bump! Baby is referring to the dose which is used preventatively for heart conditions in adults...  (It was told to me repeatedly when I was a new mom and I just double checked that with a Google search). But, leaving you alone with only your sister to watch out for you is a cps call. Being a hooker is not a cps call unless she did it in front of you. So, nta for throwing it in her face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Aaron and I have been together since we were 17.\n\n(Backstory: As a child, my mother was unethical. She was a stripper till I was 5, then escalated to an escort. My mother was beautiful, she had hair like Marilyn Monroe and young.  She had my older sister at 15 and me at 22. She was a party girl who was never ready to give up her life for her kids. Men loved her and would fly her out out the state, twice even out of the country, or she would just stay at their fancy places. By the time I was 6 she was only home 2 days out of the week. My older sister took care of me because we had no fathers. As I got older my mother would be gone for weeks at a time, until her age was no longer desirable to older rich men. I haven\u2019t talked to her much since I turned 18, but last year her health began declining and she\u2019s tried reaching out to all of us.)\n\nThis all happened last week. Rosy was pushed off the slide at daycare on the indoor playground by another child. There\u2019s bruises on her side n one small one on her head (they have tile but a foam mat covering it all, but it still bruised) I have my copy of the incident report proving what happened. \n\nMy mother was at the house Saturday and saw the bruises and asked me what happened. I told her what happened and she was like hmm.\n\nWell later that day Aaron and my mom got into an argument about Aaron giving Rosy baby aspirin (which her doctor said it was okay). It got pretty heated and my mom yelled at Aaron, \u201cI should call cps on you for those bruises on Rosy!\u201d I got upset and told her \u201csomeone should\u2019ve called Cps on you.\u201d She got upset and left and later that night called me crying telling me I was an AH and how I shouldn\u2019t hold that on her since she\u2019s trying to change and how could I say that to my sick mother.\n\nMy Uncle is also now attacking me over text about disrespecting my mother. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH, don\u2019t question my parenting skills and I won\u2019t question yours.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Later that day my mother and gf got into a heated argument and my mother told my gf she should call cps on her for the bruises on my daughter. I got angry and told my mom someone should\u2019ve called cps on you. She left and later that night she called me and said I was an AH bc I know she\u2019s changed and how could I say that to my sick mom. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH, she questioning my parenting when she did a horrible job for years.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
