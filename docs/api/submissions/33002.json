In trying to be tolerant, I've let them run riot in a way that makes me look like a push-over.", "What a blessing that she got him out of there. Thank your lucky stars!!!!\n\nJust keep saying \u2018No thanks. For the sake of our relationship, it\u2019s a hard no for me. Love you though!\u201d", "Well, he\u2019s young and she sounds like an idiot. Give it time, I guess.", "NTA - they are adults with a serious drug habit.  \n\nThe weed they likely use is way stronger than the stuff you probably grew up with and it\u2019s cost them their ability to be functioning adults.  And I\u2019m pro medical marijuana and use it myself but the really strong stuff available today is crazy and I have seen people lose their way in life from it.  \n\nYou would be enabling them further in their addiction to allow them to move in with you.  You can\u2019t stop their use. It\u2019s not just casual use.  It\u2019s addiction at this point. \n\nPerhaps consider going to Alanon meetings.  They are for family who have loved ones who have addiction.  It\u2019s about learning to have boundaries, how to enforce them, how not to enable and how to get yourself strong and in a good place where you are free from guilt for not going along with and enabling their addiction.  \n\nYour son probably has to find his own rock bottom before he is motivated to change.  The faster you let him find it, likely the better for all involved.  \n\nHope you decide to love yourself and to stand  strong and protect your mental health and your home, it\u2019s suppose to be your sanctuary from the world.", "NTA. Why the heck would you? Your son knows that you hate the smell and the squalor. He knows that you want him to help with chores, yet he knows that he can't/won't because he is occupied with his weed habit only.

Fool me twice shame on me.", "your son has a drug habit.  dont enable by letting him move in.  he needs to grow up.", "NTA. Dont let him back for his own good.", "NTA. Don't let them fool you twice.", "NTA however if you do cave to his pressure, make him sign a housing agreement that includes a zero tolerance policy of NO drugs including weed, no overnight guests, & working x hours a week.", "NTA, son needs to get his shit together.", "NTA - I smoke weed daily. My home looks and smells nothing like that. I hold down professional employment. The memory thing I can kind of get behind. My wife asked me for some crackers to go with her meal that I served her last night and I literally forgot within 5 seconds and started cleaning up the dinner prep dishes.\n\nYour son and her girlfriend are lazy slobs. The weed is only amplifying what already exists. Hold firm and thanks but no thanks to them moving in again.", "NTA. Your son needs to get a job and his own place. There\u2019s no reason for you to continue to enable his shiftless, irresponsible behavior.", "NTA ! Sounds like a  real chore living with people like this and the house smelling like weed all the time when you don't smoke is Nasty AF. I am totally with you and I am a stoner lol. If they wants to have that lifestyle and they don't like to clean or do chores then they should get their own place. You don't deserve to be disrespected like that.", "NTA\n\nWeed is extra. If you can afford weed, you\u2019re doing ok to get your own place. Fuck that noise. Rent & food and adult responsibilities before fun.", "NTA And wow, you dodged a bullet when she moved them both out in anger.  Do not let them move back in without having a job and other indications they're in the process of turning their lives around.", "NTA If you don't want to. You don't trust him. It's okay to say no.\n\nIt's also okay to say- I'll give you a 2nd chance but that there are going to be rules this time and make him sign a lease agreement that lays out that in exchange for renting a room in the house he has to pay $X/month and that the rules of the house are A, B, C.\n\nSo stuff like no smoking in the house, no littering in the yard, whatever. (There should be examples online of California room to rent agreements. They're different than regular leases cuz it falls under a different law technically and that's all I know.) And make it clear to him that if he doesn't hold up his end up the deal, parent or not- you'd evict him.\n\nYou love him but you won't enable him.", "NTA", "100% did the right thing, in fact I'd now change locks and get a ring doorbell camera or something for peace of mind.", "INFO: is he bringing his girlfriend with him this time? If not, I'd take him. If so, then no.", "NTA but don\u2019t blame the weed. It\u2019s their unclean habits that are the problem.", "When ANYTHING (but especially a drug, even if it is legal) becomes your personality, it's a problem. So, I like Pepsi (probably too much), but it hasn't taken over my life....Can you imagine, say, a person loving beef jerky to the point that's all they talked about & all of their activities related to beef jerky? Yikes.\n\nOP is NTA.", "NTA. That\u2019s a hard no.", "Um so how is your son 21 and his girlfriend is 18 but they\u2019re in a long term relationship?", "NTA - if you want him to come back(because I know you care) let him know that there will be no weed on the property.  Not just in the house, but in the backyard, the garage, the front yard.  No weed.  It's your house so it's your rules.  This is non negotiable.  If he doesn't like it, he can find a different place.  He's an adult and needs to learn how to live on his own.", "Don\u2019t do it! There is nothing wrong with setting boundaries. He will think this is ok and you will forever have to take care of him.", "Whew, it must be such an incredible relief to have them gone!\n\nNTA, don't ever let him back in.", "They probably learned you would have to evict them legally to get them otherwise to get rid of them. \n\nNTA I would say a hard no!", "They had total disrespect for you and your home.  Now you have your peace and quiet back along with a clean home.", "Your comment bought a tear to my eye - thank so much for reaching out.", "I feel like people really don\u2019t take seriously just how strong the new stuff is. Every time I walk into the smoke shop they offer me some new D9, D20, D10 or whatever. Like why are you guys trying to go crazier than D8? I take a toke or two from my D8 pen and feel like I\u2019m as high as 2018 type smoking. I literally feel like I\u2019m smoking weed when it isn\u2019t. I have no idea why people are trying to phase out weaker stuff.", "Thanks for making me laugh! Great comment.", "Even if he'd agree to both terms, I would bet he wouldn't honor either.\n\nLike he'd bring/sneak his GF in & also sneak around still smoking because he thinks he can \"hide it.\" I remember the gals in HS who'd sneak a smoke or drink in during lunch & then POUR on the cheap ass cologne from WalMart thinking it would mask the smell(s). Uh, no, Tiffany....now you just smell like smoke/vodka & Lady Stetson.......", "There were conditions and they ignored them. Why would they follow them now?", "They already had their interview and showed what they felt was acceptable behavior. \n\nYour suggestion is just a pipe dream. No pun intended.", "The gf basically said \u201chow dare you be upset that you\u2019re in boiling water!\u201d And you realized \u201cwait.  I am in boiling water. What the heck?\u201d\n\nI paid rent for a family member for a year. Turned out they had an addiction problem. They disappeared, and I had to clean out a naaasty apartment while paying for it.  I was done after that.", "Thank you", "If you do cave (I strongly recommend not caving), make him sign a contract. Put every single rule down and put a zero chances clause. If he breaks a rule he's out. That way if he refuses to leave you have a legal route to force them out of your home. You have to protect yourself here."]}
