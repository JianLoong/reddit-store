{"id": 26999, "submission_id": "16karl9", "title": "AITA for shouting my mother out of my room during a migraine?", "selftext": "I \\[24M\\] recently had my mum \\[55F\\] and dad \\[54M\\]  and siblings over for a few days. I think I was a good host and for the most part is went very well up until the incident.\n\nFor context I suffer a lot from migraines, and when I have them I can barely think and just lie down in a dark room for the rest of the day. I literally cannot talk to people, think or process words during them because the pain is overwhelming. When I have them any noise or light is also extremely painful and nausea inducing.\n\nWhen my family was over, on the second last night I left dinner early due to a migraine and told everyone to enjoy themselves but not disturb me until my migraine was gone and I would tell them when that was. Despite this, my mum came into the dark room I was in, turned on the lights and started asking me about numerous things (what we would do tomorrow, if I would rejoin them soon, dessert etc). Tbh i barely even remember the specifics of what she was asking were, I couldnt process the words properly. I do know none of them were urgent though, and while knowing them may have been convenient it was not a necessity.\n\nI asked her nicely to turn off the lights and leave my room because I couldnt think at that moment and it was too painful. Since I get migraines regularly and when I was a teen, I've expressed I literally cannot think, process words or talk during bad ones before, so this wasnt the first time she was hearing this. Despite my requests she kept talking and interrupting me to ask more non urgent things and try to have a conversation. After about the third try I was literally begging for her to leave but she kept insisting on \"making a plan for tomorrow\".\n\nAt this point the light had been on for way too long and I was feeling awful and I just couldnt anymore, I snapped and yelled at her at the top of my lungs and said some not nice things, resulting in her silently leaving my room (side note: turns out yelling hurts a LOT during a migraine). It was definitely not pretty nor respectful and everyone heard and it made quite a scene.\n\nNot respecting my need for space during migraines has been an issue with her in the past, but Ive never snapped this badly about it. I couldve just dealt with it i guess and made plans for the day after, but at the time I felt I could barely form proper speech, nevermind think through the plans for the next day. I asked nicely for her to leave multiple times and she didnt.\n\nNow they have left and my mum and dad are calling my behaviour unacceptable, which I understand it may be because shouting at your mother like that is very very rarely acceptable. My siblings havent mentioned it yet. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Some people are asking what the \"not nice things\" I said were. I basically told her very disrespectfully to leave and not come back into my room, she was selfish for not considering the pain I was in and she has never respected when I ask for her to leave. She took some of this (espescially the selfish and never respecting space) as me calling her a bad parent, I dont think she is and shes great in most aspects other than this, but I can see how it could be interpreted in that way.", "created_utc": 1694879335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16karl9/aita_for_shouting_my_mother_out_of_my_room_during/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am 60 and have had migraines since my 20s. They are unbearable and my family and friends would never act like your mother. That\u2019s unacceptable.

And until she apologizes, they will not be invited back.\n\nAlso, have you seen a neurologist about your migraines? After years of suffering, they were able to provide some relief.", "NTA . What you said was in the heat of the moment.

Your mom sounds entitled as she would demand your attention and time even after you told her not to disturb you because of migraine.", "NTA - its strange they wouldn\u2019t know the drill and assist you to get better.\n\nNot sure what country you\u2019re in but talk to a doc as there are very effective meds today - both preventative and \u201crescue\u201c types. Several are generic now and very affordable. Many of us have had migraines since childhood and no longer miss days like this. Most people I work with don\u2019t even know I get migraines.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA. This is so bizarre. You did what you had to do to get her out of your room (and gave her plenty of warnings along the way)", "NTA.  \n\n\nI have a lot of friends with chronic invisible health problems, including issues with migraines like you're describing. And this sort of this is *so freaking* *common*. I don't know what it is with parents ignoring or disbelieving their own children saying they're in pain.  \n\n\nAnyway, pain brings out the worst in people. You're absolutely NTA for breaking briefly under that strain. Hope you're able to figure out whatever underlying issues cause those migraines. For my wife it was a gluten intolerance; for my friend it was Interstitial Cystitis. Good luck.", "NTA- as a sufferer too I know how awful it is being disturbed when dealing with a migraine. It\u2019s disgraceful she won\u2019t acknowledge how her behaviour is wrong", "NTA at all. What you said was the truth. She was being disrespectful, she was being selfish and she was being rude. She was physically hurting you. It was the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. Please don't apologize. You need to get this point through to her. Hope you feel better.", "NTA  Mom FAFO!", "NTA because I understand your frustration in the moment, but if you genuinely think your mom is usually a good parent I would still apologize. Maybe call and say you're sorry for yelling, but also emphasize how much pain you were in at the time. Hopefully she will understand a little better in the future.", ">yelled at her at the top of my lungs and said some not nice things...It was definitely not pretty nor respectful and everyone heard and it made quite a scene.\n\nSounds like ESH, Everybody Sucks Here, unless you detail exactly what you told her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not only did she ignore your pain, but she continued to torture you after repeatedly asking her to stop.  She deserved to be pepper sprayed. \n\n For you to be in such pain and have your mother ignore it is criminal. She deserved whatever you said and more. Anybody finding fault with you has never dealt with debilitating pain.\n\nHow is it even possible that you've suffered like this for tears and your mother isn't fully knowledgeable about your condition and how to help? That's what a loving mother does. Why do your parents treat you so badly?", "NTA!! Do not feel guilty for yelling \"not nice\" things at a person who showed absolutely no respect for your personal space, pain or repeated requests that she leave you alone.

They literally wipe the floor with me and I get them multiple times a month. Any movement, noise, light, anything is unbearably painful. It actually makes me so violently sick, it\u2019s horrific! You aren\u2019t the ah! You asked three times, you was in agony. It\u2019s not your fault! I remember once I was in a & e because a migraine was so bad. Pain was radiating down my face and made me talk funny. Anyway they put me in a room with the light off while I waited for the doctors. I lay there and didn\u2019t move an inch even breathing as softly as I could because even breathing hurt! Two doctors came in and turned the light on with no warning. Omg the language that came out of my mouth was horrific! They quickly turned the light off and sent me off for a ct scan! It was a really really severe migraine. I felt embarrassed and bad after but really couldn\u2019t help it! Neither could you! She\u2019s your mama! She will forgive you!", "I had really bad migraines several times a week.  My neurologist started treating me with Botox and it is life changing.  I don\u2019t get migraines very often anymore and when I do Dr. gave me Nurtec ODT to use at the start of a migraine.

She very rarely gets them now unless she has like a sinus infection.

My mom never forgot how in pain I was when I got migraines no matter how little often they happened.", "That makes sense.
