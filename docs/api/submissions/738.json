Me and my boyfriend just moved into our apartment less than 6 months ago, and every month for an entire work week we have had to stay at her house to babysit her dog. Technically it\u2019s my boyfriends dog and he just lives with his mother, the dog is 13 years old but he is very naughty. He wakes us up every night at 3am when we stay there and I just hate being there and would rather be home in our own stuff with my own dog. We just had to stay at her house last weekend, which I was very upset about because I like to enjoy my weekends in my own apartment getting ready for the week. \n\nNot to mention, her house is a whole 30 minutes in a different direction of my job vs 5 minutes right down the road from our apartment. I told my BF, next week when she leaves I want to stay home in our apartment for the 4 days he has to stay at her house. He was very upset and said he\u2019d stay with me if it were the other way around. It seriously stresses me out to have to constantly pack a bag and live in someone else\u2019s house a whole week out of every month and i\u2019m tired of it. I feel like I may be being a drama queen, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1667340636, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjmzlw/aita_for_staying_home_while_my_boyfriend_stays_at/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
