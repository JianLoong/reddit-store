If you really do care what the angry ones think, you could try having some of your supporters talk with them.... but really, you would suffer no big loss by cutting these assholes from your life.", "NTA, your mom cut them off for treating you that way. The fact that they thought it was okay to insult you at HER funeral would have been justification enough to kick them out. The fact that they flipped out and made a scene is just abhorrent. You did nothing wrong. I'm proud of you for not snapping at the first comment honestly.", "NTA and your mom would be proud of you. Keep your head up, you did the right thing. Don't worry about those evil people, they're projecting. I'm so sorry for your loss and just know you were never the problem, they were.", "NTA. Sorry for your tragic loss. Cancer sucks!\n\nThe \"devil child\" certainly grew into an amazing man. Great Mom for the win!  Ignore the other side, block them, go NC. Luckily for you, you never have to deal with that terrible family again.\nGlad you have good support and lots of love. Here's to a better 2023.", "The way I see it OP was honouring his mother at the funeral. She sounds like a kick ass lady and no way would she have put up with anyone, especially her family, talk about her child that way.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour mum was right for cutting these toxic people from her life.", ">Ps. It might be too late, but be careful reading her letters/diaries. Your mom protected you from a lot of bad, and shielded you from what she was going through. Glad you have a support system in place, think about therapy for dealing with anything you find in the writings.\n\n\nYes I am seeing a therapist about whatever I find in my mom's writings. She apparently had quite a few of them, one even describing my sperm donor and the circumstances that left my mom pregnant with me. \n\n\nIt's been a lot to deal with. But I'm going through everything, slowly. Jake and his family, and my girlfriend are my rocks, so I know that despite all the shit I may have to put through from mom's family, I will always have someone to watch my back and look after me.", "No my mom asked me to never show the entries to anyone but Jake. I'm going to respect her wishes in this...", "That they are her family means jack shit if they can\u2019t do even the minimum of not harassing the deceased person\u2019s only child at the funeral. The back story makes it clear these people are awful and they deserve every bit of scorn thrown their way. OP is NTA, but you are.", "Imagine this, you have a child, then you die, then that child kicks out your family who loves you because they didn\u2019t especially like your child, tell me, how would you feel? See if you were to lie to me you would say \u201cwell they were being mean to my child\u201d but in reality you\u2019d be pissed. I\u2019m not putting any blame on op for being born and I think it\u2019s wrong of them to call her \u201cdemon child\u201d but don\u2019t for a sec think that it\u2019s right to kick grieving family members out of their own daughters funeral because you don\u2019t like them.", "Her mother protected him from them all her life. I bet she would be proud he can protect himself on his own.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
