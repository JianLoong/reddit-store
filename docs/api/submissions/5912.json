She raised me as a single teen mom, and ever since I completed university, lived with me and my girlfriend so that I could support her. Fuck cancer, honestly. \n\n\nMom was minimal-contact with her parents and brother, and I recently found out from her diary that I was called some really mean things like a \"devil child\" by her parents. I didn't think much of my grandparents growing up, but this was all uncalled for. Still, as obligatory, they did come to my mom's funeral. \n\n\nI got to see firsthand the shit mom protected me from. Her mother called me the \"devil child\" and started saying that \"you killed my daughter, you killed my baby,\" I wrote it off as grief talking with extreme difficulty. Was crying in my girlfriend's arms the next moment we got alone. \n\n\nThings came to a heated point, when mom's father and brother started doing the same thing, and told me she should've aborted me. That my birth was the worst thing to happen to their family. At this point, I went up to my mom's ex-boyfriend Jake (not real name), the closest thing I've had to a father in my life and his wife, and told them that I want them out, at any cost. \n\n\nA lil' background on this ex of my mom's. He and my mom dated from when I was 7 to 12, and he was slightly younger than mom. Mom and him ended things to differences relating to careers, and he ended up marrying a really nice lady, and has two kids with her, for whom I'm \"big bro.\" They know I'm not their biological brother, but they respect and love me as if I'm one. And during this entire time with mom in hospice, this family of four has been the greatest support system I could hope for, along with my girlfriend's family. \n\n\nJake, obliged and instructed security to escort mom's parents and brother out. In protest, a lot of others in my mom's family also walked out, and those of these relatives on social media called me out on depriving my grandparents from grieving their daughter. A few of the \"moderate\" ones understood that I'm not in the best state with everything going on as it is, and said that while I did overreact, it was understandable. And the rest are completely on my side, calling them out on their bs and giving me psychological trauma by what they said during the funeral.\n\n\nThis entire situation has kind of turned into one where the extended family is divided between me, the \"devil child\" and them, who apparently according to their supporters are \"angel grandparents\" to mom's brothers' kids. This entire situation has been very hard on me, and I haven't recovered well, and I feel like I overreacted on this one. Jake, his wife, girlfriend, her parents and mom's cousin disagree, but I kinda feel like an asshole.\n\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n\nEdit: A small clarification that I'd hoped won't be needed, my mom was not loved by her parents and brother. She was kicked out of parents' house when she refused to give me up. Mom's uncle took her in, and helped take care of me with his wife for about 3 years while mom finished high school and got herself through community college. Her uncle and aunt were grandpa and grandma to me, though they are not with us anymore. \n\n\nThe minimal contact remained at grandpa's insistence, due to his religious belief that some unity in the family must remain. According to mom's journals, grandpa and grandma took mom and me in due to their religious devotion, and grandpa was quoted to say \"I will take my sister's sin upon me to repent.\" Something along those lines. Mom's cousin from grandpa and grandma is busy convincing everyone that what I did was justified, as he knew what happened 24 years ago.", "created_utc": 1672305079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy0vhy/aita_for_kicking_moms_family_out_of_her_funeral/", "score": 711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
