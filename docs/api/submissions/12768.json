When I fired it up, it was one of those ransomware programs - camera was showing the webcam feed on a fake police website. I was able to get his computer somewhat back to normal after a while, which took longer than he'd have liked according to his comments.

We left shortly after that, but on the way out we heard the two of them arguing.\n\nMy wife gave me both barrels in the car, but I said he is always giving me hassle and I keep my mouth shut.
