Comments about being a \"real man\" would INFURIATE me.  But if you want to have an honest discussion with your wife about why you did something to hurt her father (and her parents' marriage.  Which would understandably upset your wife), then you need to be fully honest about your intentions and feelings.\n\nI would bet a lot of this could have been prevented with an honest conversation with you wife ages ago, where you let her know this was bothering you, and she needed to speak to her parents.
