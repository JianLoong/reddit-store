This was found when she was about 4 weeks old, and it\u2019s been my normal since. \n\nEvery time we\u2019ve had any meal at my in-laws since our daughter has been born, I\u2019m always left eating only meat and bread, because my FIL will make the salad with feta cheese tossed through it, or butter potatoes etc. No matter how many times I ask FIL to put some salad aside before putting cheese through it, or just to leave me some plain potatoes, it never happens. I usually just hold my tongue, eat what I can, then eat again when I get home.  \n\nToday however was my last straw - my FIL and step-MIL host a lunch every 6ish months with family friends. At the last one we attended, we arrived at 11:30, lunch wasn\u2019t served till nearly 2pm, and because of the commotion, our daughter didn\u2019t sleep and was so overtired that I left almost in tears because I was hungry, and had a screaming baby. My husband said it was just a case of his dad not remembering what it is like to have a new baby and that next time wouldn\u2019t be so bad. \n\nWhen FIL invited us to today, we stipulated that we had to leave by 2pm as my husband had a stag do to attend this afternoon. We were assured that there would be food for me to eat, and that lunch would be served between 1 and 1:30. I knew this wouldn\u2019t be the case when I saw the meat put in the oven at 1pm. \n\nFIL finally announced at 1:48pm that lunch was ready, and when I got up to serve myself, I saw the salad was covered in feta, and the potato salad type dish was made with buttered potatoes. I managed to fish a little bit of lettuce and tomato from the salad and wipe the bit of feta off it, but that was it, aside from the usual meat and 2 slices of plain bread I always have. \n\nMy husband and I quickly had our lunch, said our goodbyes and left. As I was dropping off husband to the stag-do, I drove. On the way he tells me that we don\u2019t need to rush and he allowed a little extra time because he knew this would happen. I said if he knew this would happen, why didn\u2019t he say anything? He just said there was nothing he could do. I told him that it was the same as last time and that I left hungry again. He said that we had time to have seconds and I retorted that I couldn\u2019t eat the salads and I\u2019m sick of eating just meat and bread any time we visit. I told him I\u2019m done and I\u2019m not attending any more meals at FIL and step-MIL because I don\u2019t want our daughter to be subjected to this when she\u2019s older. He said that that wouldn\u2019t be the case, and I told him that makes it worse because that makes it sound like they\u2019ll make the effort for her but not for me. \n\nHe said I was being ridiculous and that I can always take my own food next time. \n\nSo it got me thinking: \nAm I an asshole for lashing out? \nMaybe I\u2019m just taking things personally because I\u2019m still hungry, and maybe it will be easier just to bring my own food?", "created_utc": 1699079178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nflds/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_am_not_attending/", "score": 3807, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They will not accommodate you, they will not accommodate your daughter. They will think- oh a little won\u2019t hurt, etc. They\u2019ve already been inconsiderate for for daughter and for you.

Are you packing food for her and not yourself?", "NTA - I have major food allergies and let folks know in advance. They get one shot - because it's my life, and I can't choose to have them or not have them, but people can choose to let me eat something simple or tell me to bring my own meal.

If you\u2019re uncomfortable every time you visit the in-laws, she is probably picking up on this and doesn\u2019t like them either because you don\u2019t. I mention this because multiple visits might be having the opposite of helping her bond if she\u2019s picking up on your tension. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize how true this was with my own daughter until my mother pointed it out. We do many gatherings that include my family and my husbands. My FIL is wonderful with kids and his other grandchildren adore him, but my daughter wants nothing to do with him no matter how hard she tries. (She\u2019s almost 2 now) and it\u2019s not that she\u2019s universally shy. She loves my parents and her great aunt and uncle on my husbands side. I loathe my FIL because he is emotionally abusive to my husband. My husbands the scapegoat in their family dynamic.  We still invite him to things occasionally because that is what my husband wants and it\u2019s his call. (I\u2019m always in the same room so FIL never has access aline to my daughter) No matter how engaging he tries to be or how many fun new toys he brings, she ignores him. I could never figure out quite why until my mom pointed out that anything I love, people books etc, they are my daughters favorite, and people I don\u2019t like (even if I act nice and polite) my daughter can sense it and adopts my attitude.

A real apology and an ingredient list of the next meal, which is then followed? A real apology and then a meal that's fully safe for you and daughter?) It's kind to lay open the path to reconciliation by communicating clearly what people are doing wrong and how they can fix it.\n\nAlso, pro tip: if they or DH try to spin that it must be a personal favorites thing after all w/ this as the excuse, remember that the right to write the narrative doesn't always go to the person who says their piece loudest and most forcefully--it actually often goes to the person who uses repetition. Even a mild-mannered nice lady can do that. And with a smile! Kill 'em with kindness if that's your style. \"Oh honey, you know I'd visit them if I was sure they'd serve food I can eat.

And if they do, that means you can FILL THE AIR WITH THEM. You can say something like this EVERY time the matter comes up in any way.
