I really wish people would just respect my needs and not push that I can have just a bit.", "I've made choices that are more \"ethical\" than medical and it kinda freaks me out how people go on about bacon ... but I keep my opinions to myself in company, unless asked.", "You\u2019re comparing things that aren\u2019t on the same level, here. Please don\u2019t be one of those people that equates POC/queer folk with animals.\n\nProselytizing at the dinner table about something someone eats is rude af when you agreed to go to dinner there with them.", "Now you're just engaging and words play. I clearly established the kind of use I'm giving to \"should\" by stating both scenarios, and you're twisting it with an equivocation.\n\nAlso, being vegan isn't remotely in the same ballpark of not being racist, homophobic, not killing, raping, stealing, etc.\n\nNice try, though.", "It still kind of boggles the mind that people still give people who are vegan/vegetarian crap. I'll admit, in my younger years I might have been impertinent enough to ask why someone is a vegetarian/vegan but it was just curiosity. These days, I don't even bat an eyelash. The only time further discussion would be warranted would be if we were going out to eat or hosting an event, in which case I may double-check to make sure there's something available for them to eat. \n\nHonestly, the vast majority of vegetarians and vegans I've known are pretty chill and are usually exremely grateful when folks take the time to accommodate them.", "They do that when they think you are on a weight loss diet. It's just plain good health for everybody to maintain their weight. But somehow people feel the need to sabotage weight loss diets. But not any other health issues.\n\n I tell people it's a medical condition. That helps some. Unless it's some extra delicious juicy dessert that they wish they had the willpower to refuse", "Good on you for taking your stand without being obnoxious", "Slightly off topic, but every time someone mentions veal, it reminds me of something that happened with a good friend and former coworker of mine who's French. She was at a work conference in Texas and there was an excursion for everyone to a ranch just outside of Dallas. They came across a corral with a cow and calf, and she pointed to the calf and said, \"Oh, how cute, a veal!\" Everyone was kind of shocked at first because they didn't know that \"calf\" in French also means \"veal.\" Needless to say it became something of a legendary inside joke at the company.", "That's exactly it. I have lost a significant amount of weight after diagnosis and now people are asking me for weight-loss advice. \nThe same people who have known that I spent almost 4 months in bed sick in 2022.\n\n\nThey think because my body is smaller that I am healthier", "I am not totally without obnoxity but I work on it :D", "I do several fiber arts and have always chuckled at the idea of sheep being \"pre-yarn.\"", "We are all improving at something if we are moving forward"]}
