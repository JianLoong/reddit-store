There are assholes on both sides.\n\nEven though I still would differentiate. I have many vegan/vegetarian friends and they let me eat what I want and I let them eat what they want.\n\nBut then I also met vegetarians/vegans who really had the urge to shove their beliefs into my face, out of the blue - whereas most of my vegetarian friends dont even get recognised as vegetarians - they just order something without meat and leave the topic be. I think this \"being on a mission\" behaviour triggers a lot of meat eaters to mock them/ask stupid questions. Still not right, but I think there is a difference. And unfortunately (at least from my experience) it is true that many vegans/vegetarians need to let everyone know they dont eat meat and why and their conversations often seem to be centered around their lifestyle.  \n\n\nEdit: Typos, my English apparently sucks lmao", "Yeah I was vegetarian for a bit (still eat plenty of meals without meat) and people used to give me a hard time and act like I was malnourished or something or an affront to them just eating what I wanted and avoiding animal products. I\u2019ve never been zealous one way or the other, but more \u201ccarnivores\u201d (obviously omnivores but meat evangelists) have been annoying to me than self righteous vegetarians, especially when I was a younger woman and lived in the South. When I lived overseas, one country I lived in literally many people didn\u2019t understand vegetarians don\u2019t eat seafood either but at least they tried when I explained a little and had the language barrier as an excuse.", "Their MLM scheme.", "It's just a joke - vegetarians, atheists and crossfiters are very vocal (annoyingly so) about how they are in fact vegetarian/atheist/do CrossFit", "You are 100% correct.   No one HAS TO, but there are plenty of people that will tell you that you have to.    Not just about your diet, but religion or any political stance.  Just telling some passionate, inconsiderate person that you don't believe they way that they do on something will generally not end the conversation.  \n\nThat is the route that I take IRL, but I have a lot of patience and am not passionate about enough things, that people usually get exhausted trying to spread their wood with me.", "Exactly that\u2019s why I\u2019m confused on the comments!", "Ah! Won't even bother.", "We found the SIL!", "Same here. I can't eat any grain products or sugar. I leave others alone about their dietary choices and don't expect any special consideration for mine.\n\n But it really irks me when people wave sweets at me and say things like,  \"oh this one little bit won't hurt.\"\n\n Yes it will", "And a lot of meat eaters I know. It's super sad bro. Some things just aren't humane.", "What\u2019s veal?", "Oh that would do it for sure.", "Can you even find veal any more?  Yum.", "And that's exactly why I said it.", "As a vegetarian, I'd say some of it is probably a learned trauma response. Literally half of the people I tell I'm a vegetarian ask me to immediately explain myself. Maybe one out of ten insists that they're going to eat more meat just to punish me for it. What you see are the occasional vegetarian/vegan who tries to treat others the way they get treated", "I genuinely want to meet one lol\n\n(Am on the side of NTA on this btw) just wondering where everyone in the comments is meeting these people and getting this idea from that they do that as I\u2019ve never met a vegetarian/vegan who has\n\nUnless people just upset they\u2019re not eating meat", "Lol not even close dude", "I didn't say that I agree with the methods of raising most veal, chief", "Veal is calf meat (young cows, not people legs LOL), usually taken at 6 months old or younger.\n\nThe young age that they are slaughtered is upsetting to a lot of people, but the bigger issue is the conditions that many veal calves are [raised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veal). Some of the worst practices have been banned in most parts of the world, but even so many of the methods of raising veal are still considered cruel by many people", "It's beef that's under a year old. There are various types and most come from the dairy industry. It's easier to find humanely raised veal these days thankfully. A few years ago we got half a calf that acquaintances had raised until it was a just under a year.  It was delicious, but it also lived a happy little life and was killed humanely. Not everyone is going to be a vegetarian, but making sure you try to source your meat from ethical sources helps.", "Baby/young sheep. Supposedly its more tender than lamb\n\nEdit: apparently it's calf meat, not sheep. Whoops. I just knew its baby animal and expensive where I live. I don't personally feel right eating it for several reasons; killing something before it has a good chance at life is a waste to me no matter how good it tastes. I prefer wild game for that reason, or we buy discounted/clearance meat so the animal's death wasnt in vain", "Veal is calf meat, more tender than an adult cow.  My mom used to put veal and pork into her tourti\u00e8res \ud83e\udd67", "I think it\u2019s deer or a baby cows meat.", "General practice for veal is to remove the calf from its mother within 72 hours of birth and raise them alone in a stall with enough space to stand, lay down, and stretch, but not much else. They are also usually fed a specific milk or soy based diet for their entire lives (3 weeks to 9 months.) The restrictive diet and movement restrictions in theory make the meat very tender because the muscles don't get worked very much.", "mmmm lamb  :)", "The way I read it in my head made it even more amusing. Thank y'all for a good morning chuckle\ud83e\udd23", "My sister is vegan for years now, and she mentioned it a few times, but that was it. I asked her whether or not she got a lot of stupid comments and she said not many. She is also annoyed with vegans/vegetarians who \"are on a mission\". Of course, we also dislike \"meat eaters\" on a mission. Its interesting, her becoming vegan also made me reduce meat consume because we used to casually talking about food and health, no blaming, no offending, no whataboutisms. But if I imagine her telling me to stop eating meat and trying to convince me, I probably would still eat as much meat as before, haha. Sounds stupid, but lets be honest, humans are kind of stupid. \n\nI dont know, for some, what you say might be true, but it still is counterproductive,  it becomes a vicious cycle in which both sides radicalize themselves. \n\nOf course, all of this is anecdotal. The reactions you get heavily depend on where you are from and what kind of people you meet. I live in a big, quite liberal city in Germany.", "sweet dude \ud83e\udd19 glad to hear it", "Veal is calves, not lamb.", "deer is venison and it's delicious", "Thank you all for explaining.", "Yeah, Germany is actually one of the most vegetarian countries in the world (roughly 10% vegetarian). That's about twice the rate in the US, and while it's usually not that bad in the cities here, folks who just moved from rural parts of the country will get suuuuuuper nosy about my diet.", "Thanks for the correction! I edited my comment. Now I'm over here looking up whatever I confused veal with. Lol"]}
