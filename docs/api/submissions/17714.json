They have 50/50 custody technically, but I spend more time with my dad because his place is bigger and closer to my friends. My stepmom is actually really nice, I was worried, but she doesn'y push, she listens to me, and she actually cares about me  like I'm her kid.\n\nI started calling her mom like a year ago, I didn't replace my bio mom or anything, it's just it felt better than calling her by her name. My mom doesn't really like her because she's pretty young and she thinks she spoils me, but she's never actually said that. Either way I didn't think we had any issues until the other week.\n\nMy mom came to pick me up to go to her place, and came in to wait while I got the rest of my stuff because it was raining. My stepmom reminded me to take my lhone charger, and I pretty much just told her \"Thanks mom, love you bye\" and we left. The entire car ride my mom was quiet, and later when I came out of my room for dinner she looked like she'd been crying.\n\nI asked her what was wrong, and she said she was hurt that I called my stepmother mom in front of her. I said that she already knew I called her that, but she though I called her mom in front of her on purpose just to hurt her. She thinks I hate her, and I'm acting like that just to make her feel bad.\n\nEither way things were really quiet and tense over there, so I went back to my dads after a couple days.

This is my own opinion .", "Soft YTA given OP's age. You're already spending more time with dad and a stepmom who seems to act more like a friend than a parent. Now, you're calling the younger woman your father is with 'mom'?\n\nWhen your mother thought you called the stepmom 'mom' to hurt her, OP should have explained as she does in this post. Instead, OP just let things get quiet and tense then left early. \n\nReach out to your mother and explain yourself fully this time. And, try to spend quality time with her.

Unless your mom did something bad, she's your mom. Stepmom didn't raise you. She's been in your life 3 years, late teenage years at that. That's not being a mom. Your mom raised you as \"mom\" for 14 years before that. The very least you could do is not call SM mom in front of her. I've had my pets for longer than you've known her... Just because she's got a bigger house and lives closer to your friends..? Once you're a parent/have grown up a little you'll feel bad for your mother.", "Soft YTA here but still an AH.

Your mom can feel hurt by it, but she needs to get used to it. It is great that you are able to bond with your stepmom to the point of being comfortable with calling her mom. Plus, if your biological mom already knew you called your stepmom by that name, I don't see why she shouldn't have expected it and certainly don't see why she can accuse you of saying that to intentionally hurt her.", "NTA. You have two moms and that\u2019s ok. I can understand why your bio mom might feel hurt, but that\u2019s not your fault.

If you are ready to call her mom then that it okay. Try to understand how your mom is feeling, tell her you love her and that she will always be number one, she litteraly birthed you. But set a boundary that while you love her you also love your step mom and dad. If you want to think of your step mom as a mom and she treats you with respect there is nothing wrong with that. And the fact she spoils you is awesome. Lol it\u2019s step parent plus. Nothing wrong with it. \n\nShe should be happy youre not around an evil step mother and you\u2019re around a very nice woman who values and respects you.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to these people who are telling you that you\u2019re the asshole. I assure you, you are not. Some of these people might just be projecting onto you.

Can you have a conversation about this with her? You are old enough to have open and honest conversation with your parents. She may feel better if you explain that you have not replaced her and did not mean to hurt her feelings.  When kids are learning to talk one of their first words is mom. Then they call everyone mom for a bit, and your heart breaks a little until you remember that, they have a name that they can say to communicate, so they use it a lot. Next, they use that name for just mom, and it gets to be very special. You didn't so anything wrong by calling your stepmother mom. It is ok to talk things through with people and make sure they have the whole picture. Then you let them work it out. We do have a responsibility to our loved ones when we have hurt them. Even when we don't mean to be hurtful. Her feelings are her responsibility, but you can help her feel better. That isn't universal of course. You are not responsible for others feelings. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to make things better by honest communication. You definitely didn't ruin your relationship with your mom.", "NTA. i see why og mom was hurt but that\u2019s a personal problem for her tbh", "NTA. You have every right to call your stepmother 'mom'. You don't need to change.\n\nBut be patient with your bio mom. She may be going through stuff.", "Not at all, your mum doesn't get to define your relationships with others, they are yours, independent of her and not in spite of her", "NAH.\n\nYou have the right to call your stepmother that. It might've been nice to call her something else-- I know some people do stuff like \"Mama [her name]\"-- out of respect for your mom, but not an obligation.\n\nUltimately, your mom also has the right to be hurt. She obviously already has some insecurity around your stepmom and the fact that you chose to stay with dad more, so this was probably a knife in the heart. So many kids don't call their stepmothers of *decades* mom, even if they no longer have a bio mom, so for you to call her that within just three years is pretty unusual, and your mom definitely knows that. \n\nShe probably really does think that you were trying to passive aggressively indicate that you only want your dad's family, and may well be afraid that you've only been seeing her because you were forced to. The silent treatment is immature regardless, but unfortunately adults are just as prone to irrational behavior when hurt as teens are. \n\nI would suggest writing her a letter explaining yourself. Tell her why you started calling your stepmom \"mom,\" and explain that it hadn't occurred to you that it would hurt her, because you assumed that she knew that no woman could ever replace her in your heart or in your life, and that you don't love her any less because you didn't want to call stepmom by her name anymore. Apologize for being thoughtless about it, and tell her that you weren't trying to punish her for anything by saying it in front of her, it's just natural now.\n\nIf you like the idea of giving your stepmom a unique moniker (which, honestly? She might actually prefer also), you could put that in the letter as well.", "in an ideal world, your mom would be happy that your stepmom and you have such a motherly/daughterly relationship.\n\nYour mother is allowed to have her feelings BUT you don't have to carry any guilt for that. If she thinks you were trying to hurt her or make her feel bad, those are things she is creating in her own mind.

You can reassure your mom that you love her dearly & that isn\u2019t going to change, but beyond that it is her responsibility to keep her emotions in check.

It\u2019s so great that you have such a great relationship with your step mom and I\u2019m sure your bio mom is happy about that too. I can see why your bio Mom feels hurt.

She was fine with it until her brother called her Skeeter one day and she went ballistic.  Told her brother he had ruined something special between her and her dad and now she'd never get it back.
