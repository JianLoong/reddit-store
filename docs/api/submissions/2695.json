I (20F) went back home for the summer break. There were 2 men working there.\n\nOne day I was reorganising some papers when I heard someone screaming for help outside of the house. \nI ran down the stairs to go outside and there I saw one of the construction workers on his back not able to move on the stairs made of stones in the garden. \n\nHe basically fell right on his head on the hard stairs and was heavily bleeding. In that moment my brain froze and my body took over, I called the ambulance and put pressure on his wound as I asked him basic questions like \u00ab\u00a0what\u2019s your name\u00a0\u00bb \u00ab\u00a0what day is it\u00a0\u00bb\u2026 the man had a memory reset every 30 seconds and I was all alone with him for 30 minutes.\nThe ambulances finally made it and he was treated adequately.\n\nFast forward to last month, I received 10 texts and phone calls from the man where he said he wanted to see me and thank me because \u00ab\u00a0without you I\u2019ll be gone\u00a0\u00bb but to be honest even thinking about him makes me freeze and so scared. I don\u2019t think I could ever see him again even if he really wants to.

I can be judged on how I handled the situation and deciding not to ever talk to him or see him again. \nIn another way, I don\u2019t know if AITA because I can\u2019t force my brain to forget a traumatic experience and ignore my pain.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But if you don\u2019t want to see him, I think telling him the truth is kindest.  Like \u201cI am SO glad you are ok.  The accident was really traumatic for me and I haven\u2019t really resolved it in therapy yet.  I wish you all the best but don\u2019t feel up to meeting.\u201d", "NAH but you need to see a therapist to resolve your trauma. He wants to meet up to thank you and maybe that will help you seeing him alive, well, not bleeding. I would meet up with him because it's probably going to be healing to both of you", "NAH but seeing him alive and \"normal\" may help you with your trauma.  I agree with PPs that you should seek counseling and get the opinion of a pro. \n\nThe lady who called 911 after my bike accident stopped by a few days later to see me - possibly because she psychologically needed to see something other than me gushing blood on her sidewalk", "NAH probably, have you just been ignoring him? It shouldn't be a big deal, if he doesn't take no for an answer then he's the asshole of course, you shouldn't be ghosting him if that's what you're doing, people have commented excellent things you can say to him, get a friend to hold your hand if it's difficult for you to communicate with him, I doubt he'll take it the wrong way.", "NAH. That sounds like such a terrifying experience for you. Of course you wouldn't want a reminder of it. It's natural of him to want to meet and thank you, but you have every right to decline permanently.", "Nah. He is also not an asshole. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to write him a note, ask one of your parents to kindly write him back and tell him something polite but also declining to meet.", "NAH.  \n\n\nIt's totally understandable that he wants to thank the person who saved his life.  \n\n\nIt's also completely understandable that seeing another human being in that state, and being the one thing standing between them and death for an entire half hour, would be deeply unsettling. First responders get PTSD from seeing that kind of stuff, and they are trained professionals with proper support structures.  \n\n\nIf you are up for it maybe send a text explaining that while you are very glad he is okay and do not in any way regret doing what you did, it was a very traumatizing experience for you and you are simply not ready at this moment to face your trauma. Maybe he can send you a letter, and when you feel ready, you can read it.", "I was saved once from a lake I had fallen into. It was springtime in Alaska and I fell in pretty late at night off the boat I was in (stupid drunk teenager). I was hypothermic and bleeding BAD. I was taken via ambulance and luckily I came out of everything ok (stitches, arm sling). \n\nI wasn't sure if I would ever find out who had saved me. Then one day as luck would have it I was at work and he ended up coming into my job. He was sat at one of my tables and asked about my arm. I told him the story and he introduced himself and told me how he was the one to pull me from the water. I thanked him and paid for his and his friends meals because that was all I was able to do at the time. \n\nNTA, but maybe seeing and talking with him can end up helping with the trauma of that day.", "NTA you don't need to do something that makes you uncomfortable. Your not obligated to be thanked in person.", "NTA - but I will say this, years ago I was in a bad car accident, and I spent weeks trying to find the people who helped me.  They saved me.  I just had to thank them. It was something inside me that pushed me to do it. \n\nI talked to them 1 time, told them how thankful I was for what they did. And that was it. \n\nI still think about them to this day, but I am super appreciative of the fact that I got to say thank you.", "NTA He may feel the only way to thank you properly is in person. Can you text him and tell him simply, \u201c I am so happy you are well, but it was very hard for me to revisit that day, as I am traumatized by it. Please understand. I wish you a good life. And block his number.", "NTA. Please consider talking to a therapist about your trauma.", "NTA for not wanting further contact with a stranger. But if the incident is having that much of an impact on you, you probably should get some therapy to help process it.", "NTA. I think if it were the opposite and he had saved you, wouldn't you want to say thank you in person? I think his intentions are sincere. Maybe you could give him 5 minutes to say thank you. I think I would but obviously that's going to be your call.", "NTA- but maybe just respond saying \u201cI\u2019m glad you are alright. There\u2019s no need for thanks, I did what anyone would do in the situation. Live your life well. Goodbye\u201d and then get therapy.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him anything. As a way to get out of the situation you could reply \u201cHi, I\u2019m glad you are okay and that I could help in the situation, no thank you needed. I am uncomfortable with you contacting me, please leave me alone.\u201d Then block his number. \n\nOnly if you feel comfortable replying, else you can just block his number. If you don\u2019t reply though, you may run the risk of him showing up at your house because of his guilt/desire to thank you. \n\nI do think you may have some trauma from this scenario and I would suggest you reach out to a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
