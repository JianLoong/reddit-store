He WILL NOT clean his dishes after he cooks or eats, EVER. It was fine for maybe the first week or two where he would leave things in the sink but eventually would get to washing them the same day. It progressed pretty quickly though where I would wake up and come to the kitchen to see dishes and pans from the day before with crust in them. I always have and still today ask him nicely to wash them when he got the chance and he would would always tell me he would do it but of course when I would get back the dishes were in the same place along with a few more that he had used that day. It came to the point where I would remind him almost every time I talked with him, even if we weren\u2019t in our apartment. I assumed that if me annoying him about the dishes, the smell of the rotting food would get him to do it but it never did so I would always end up washing them or putting them in the dishwasher so we wouldn\u2019t get an infestation of critters. \n\nNow this wouldn\u2019t bother me as much if he was using his own dishes, but all of the cookware, dishes and silverware are mine and I\u2019m happy to share but I\u2019m not a maid. However I\u2019ll give him credit cause he does sometime put stuff in the dishwasher but when he does he puts EVERYTHING in there. He\u2019s already ruined a couple pans and bowls from running them through. I always have to check to see if everything is safe before running the dishwasher. I keep trying to bring up the issue but he brushes it off as something that is a shared chore. \n\nI\u2019ve never threatened to not let him use my stuff before because he needs to eat but I\u2019m so sick of coming home to a stinky dirty kitchen with moldy dishes piled in the sink so I told him that if he doesn\u2019t clean the week before thanksgiving, he doesn\u2019t get to use anything while we\u2019re on break. It\u2019s been a week and who would\u2019ve guessed that I did all of the dishes this week. So before I left for my flight this morning, I hid all of the dishes, cookware, glasses, everything and I locked them in my closet. I left him a message saying if needed plates or anything he could buy some. While I was in the airport he must\u2019ve gotten up to get some water since I got a reply from him saying that I was really petty and that Im an asshole for doing this since he\u2019s staying at the apartment for break and I left him with nothing to use. Maybe I should\u2019ve left him a plate or something but idk. Nothing has made him change before.

Hell, add your dishes to the mould pile too and let them sit and clean whenever possible for you if it's a shared chore. But not when it is completely yours and he's the one doing the damage.
