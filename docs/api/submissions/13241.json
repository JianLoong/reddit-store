She is probably hoping you as parents will be equally excited and proud of her and wants to celebrate this huge milestone instead of having a casual conversation about it.

There is nothing here to indicate that you at all crossed a line into \"helicopter parenting\" to review.

Maybe she skips college this year, and might be more motivated next year.", "So, she's shared her entire school selection and application process with you, a process that you've generously funded. She gets admitted to five, cuts that to three, you go visit the last one and, for whatever reason, she wants to extend the suspense of a decision few days, something that's well within the official deadlines.Those few days seem very important to the both of you in ways that aren't obvious from this post. Surely you'll still have enough time to move money around, and she seems willing to accept being a few days later in the housing queue.

Trauma much?", "Moving money around takes time between banks. I\u2019m using personal funds for this. I also plan on using personal funds for small expenses in order to limit the use of 529 funds since those took a huge hit this year. Again, reading my post, housing becomes limited the longer you wait. Additionally, if she selects the school that requires a plane flight to get to and from, I need to begin looking at options for that as we look at end of year this year, mid summer orientations at the school (they have two) and the getting things set up for moving. So while I may be impatient in your eyes, I\u2019m trying to help.", "I think it would be a good learning opportunity to share with her the logistics surrounding her decisions. She\u2019s about to be a grown up and she clearly has some huge blind spots in her life education. \n\nI absolutely love my parents, have a wonderful relationship with them, but they were terrible when it came to teaching me about finance and certain life things. You should show her the different accounts you\u2019ve made to pay for her education. Talk to her about how long it too you to save up for her schooling. Help her understand what ACH transfers vs wire transfers are like. Let her know that there are limits to the amounts and times your can withdraw. How long money takes to move. These are important lessons for her to know. Imagine her needing to pay for rent today, but not realizing it will take a few days for the money to be transferred? Or groceries? \n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to talk to her about prioritizing things. College will require that she manage her own time, certain resources, and be independent. Do you feel confident that she would be able to budget effectively? Has she ever done the grocery shopping, or cooking? Does she think about the household items like laundry detergent, shampoo and soap, etc that she will have to account for? Or will be spend money like a teenager, run out too quickly, and then call you and need more money asap (where if she missed the finance lesson above, she may not realize she can\u2019t always get that right away)? \n\nIt sounds like she may not be 100% sure in her decision. It\u2019s a big decision after all! She may need time to be certain, but doesn\u2019t want you to know she\u2019s not confident. Tell her it\u2019s okay if she\u2019s not certain. Make it where she can talk to you about things. Just listen. Tell her you will support her no matter what. Tell her it\u2019s okay to be nervous or anxious about her decision. Hell, she might even feel that you are pushing her out because of your focus on the practical side of things. And her comment is an attempt to get you to focus on the emotional side. \n\nThis is a great learning opportunity for you both-she gets the practical life stuff, you get to understand her emotions, and you both can build a closer bond during what is an exciting, nerve wracking time. \n\nCongrats to your daughter!", "Agree with this. You can just let her know that you will not be doing X bank stuff currently, the delays will create Y consequences, so she should prepare to do Z. \n\nHey hon, we'll wait for you to tell us where you're going to do bank stuff. So you might have to get a job in the summer to pay for these college things and maybe look into additional part time work during college. I can't think of a good example bc she should be doing these things anyway. You can be responsible for tuition and maybe housing, but pocket change should come out of work or loaned from you.", "Is waiting until the end of the week really going to make a difference in your ability to plan out payment though?  I totally agree that this is silly and juvenile on the part of your daughter, but a few extra days shouldn\u2019t really impact you, right?  Worst case scenario your daughter gets less preferred housing, and she\u2019ll just have to deal with it.", "Actually, pull your financial backing.  Let her do it on her own.", "she literally is a child, that's why she's playing games", "She seems pretty entitled and ungrateful", "She's not a kid, she's 17 and about to go to college, which her parents are paying for in full. Her parents have travelled about the country with her, at considerable expense, to help her decide. Now she's made up her mind which college she wants to go to, but she's decided she's not going to tell them right away, even though her dad has explained why he wants to know asap. She's even delighting in the fact that her inexplicable silence is annoying him.\n\nThen she has the audacity to claim her dad is guilt-tripping her, and stops talking to him. And all because he wants to know her choice so he can begin sorting out the finances (for which, by the way, she does not seem at all grateful). That is not \"playing\". That is disgraceful.", "Playing would mean the parents are in on it. They're trying to provide for her financially and she's saying it has to be on her terms because she's having fun messing with them.", "Playing with thousands of dollars her parents are giving to her? Nah, she\u2019s making big girl decision on where to go to college, she needs to stop acting like a young child. Just because she\u2019s a teenager doesn\u2019t allow behavior like this without consequences.", "Maybe take her to visit some of the grubbiest housing options available because that is exactly what she's going to end up with if she keeps up with this immature behaviour. Plus if you need to pay extra for a last-minute place, then she's going to be eating out of paper plates until she figures out how to afford her stuff.", "NTA. Your daughter is being a privileged brat. This is part of a much bigger issue. It\u2019s time to sit down with your wife and outline rules and expectations that come with funding your daughter\u2019s college education. If she\u2019s acting this way now with something she is very generous I can\u2019t imagine what a turd she will act like when she moves away for school.\n\nTake her to the local community college and tell her she can live at home. Break down the finances and show her how much you two are sacrificing for her.", "1. She started it.\n2. I don't actually see it as particularly condescending. I applied to my fair share of universities back in the day (undergraduate, law school, and master's degree programs), and I really *do* believe that if she really was 100% certain, she'd have sent her deposit in immediately, so, subconsciously, she still isn't sure.", "With the use of the word queue I get the impression you are English. Americans have no idea how difficult English banking is. We have a joke in our family that is entirely related to Americans moving to England thinking they can show up at a bank with money and an ID and open an account that day. FYI no one has ever successfully managed that yet. Americans just don't get it, it is hilarious. One of those you need a bank account to open a utility account but you need a utility account to prove address to open a bank account, and the fun begins.", "You have to move the money around regardless, right? No matter what she chooses, as long as she\u2019s choosing to go to college and you\u2019re choosing to find that, you need to move the money. Yes, the amounts may vary, but let me ask you this: if you plan for the most expensive one (assuming you\u2019ve already agreed to whatever the cost is) then is it going to be a problem if you moved a little extra? Presumably you\u2019re going to continue to make payments over the next few years, so moving the money a little early doesn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal.", "There are actions and there are consequences.", "In the end there will be consequences but you can\u2019t really do much to negate them except do all the work to cover all three possibilities.", "Then maybe let her get student loans the first year. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. That\u2019s not her money she\u2019s playing with, it\u2019s yours and you have choices. NTA", "So maybe instead of treating her as your child, go about it from a young adult standpoint. Walk her through these things and rather than demand she tell you, explain calmly the possible ramifications of her current actions and then leave it so she can choose to \u2018sink or swim\u2019.", "Yeah, if there\u2019s a bunch of adults on this thread thinking \u201cthis isnt as big of a deal as you\u2019re making it\u2026\u201d the teenager in question has been thinking that for months. It might be a big deal, idk his banking situation, but if it is he\u2019s gotta do a way better job at making that clear. This just seems like a power struggle with excuses at the moment tbh", "I mean, even if she doesnt, they just got back from visiting the last place today! She could be 98% positive but wants to sleep on it.", "Wow, defensive much? The poster suggested you may have been pushing too much already before this incident occurred, hence your daughter\u2019s trying to mess with you and get a little relief. But sure, it was \u2018trauma.\u2019", " you say \"one\" but youve already admitted to asking it twice within the confines of this story. are you honestly saying you've only asked her what college she wants to go to once?", "Right, and what does an additional seven days max do to that timeline? Regardless, if she\u2019s going to school in the fall she wouldn\u2019t be moving for months. Yes, you need to move money around, but is one week of a delay ACTUALLY going to cause that much of a delay? \n\nIf she didn\u2019t know which college she was choosing, would you be fine with her giving you a one week wait to decide? \n\nIf you would be fine with the above scenario, what\u2019s the difference?", "\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe", "Here the fight for housing is a big deal. People have to put down deposits on possible student accommodation  even before they find out if they got a college place. An extra week would make a big factor in housing. Not to mention if the end of the week literally means weekend that's going to slow down money transfers ect aswell.\n\nOP, don't rush when she finally tells you what she's chosen. She clearly thinks theres no hurry so you should take the whole process just as casually as she is.", "Indeed, I wonder who raised her? Lol, I'm guessing OP", "No, she just said she's not telling them her decision yet. Dad needs to learn to let go. I think from his responses, he knows that now. She is the one who will deal with the consequences of second choice housing and such, it's a part of growing up she needs to learn. NAH", "Putting on a patronizing tone is absolutely condescending. Advising that OP talk to his soon to be college aged teen like a small child that isn\u2019t smart enough to figure out basic consequences is only going to widen the space between OP and his daughter. \n\nI don\u2019t think talking to anyone you actually like in tones like they\u2019re an idiot is kind of a good idea if you want them to respect you.", "NVM. You must have a lot of money sitting around doing nothing so you don\u2019t see this could be an issue for some.", "I agree. College is expensive and I absolutely agree that this could be a really stressful situation for OP. But I wonder if some are forgetting what it was like to be a senior in high school. I remember the pressure from the school, the constant reminders to put in applications, to go for my SATs, to pad my application with extra curriculars. OP even says they started talking about this last year, which is good! It\u2019s good preparation! But there\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s a ton of pressure on the teenager too. \n\nThat teenager is being asked to figure out which school they\u2019re gonna go to, and some of the reasons for picking specific colleges is usually what the major will be so you\u2019re getting into a school that will properly prepare you for your upcoming jobs in the future. Sixteen year olds are asked to plan the rest of their life. It\u2019s stressful!
