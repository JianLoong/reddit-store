She is probably hoping you as parents will be equally excited and proud of her and wants to celebrate this huge milestone instead of having a casual conversation about it.

There is nothing here to indicate that you at all crossed a line into \"helicopter parenting\" to review.

Maybe she skips college this year, and might be more motivated next year.", "So, she's shared her entire school selection and application process with you, a process that you've generously funded. She gets admitted to five, cuts that to three, you go visit the last one and, for whatever reason, she wants to extend the suspense of a decision few days, something that's well within the official deadlines.Those few days seem very important to the both of you in ways that aren't obvious from this post. Surely you'll still have enough time to move money around, and she seems willing to accept being a few days later in the housing queue.

You should show her the different accounts you\u2019ve made to pay for her education. Talk to her about how long it too you to save up for her schooling. Help her understand what ACH transfers vs wire transfers are like. Let her know that there are limits to the amounts and times your can withdraw. How long money takes to move. These are important lessons for her to know. Imagine her needing to pay for rent today, but not realizing it will take a few days for the money to be transferred? Or groceries? \n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to talk to her about prioritizing things. College will require that she manage her own time, certain resources, and be independent. Do you feel confident that she would be able to budget effectively? Has she ever done the grocery shopping, or cooking? Does she think about the household items like laundry detergent, shampoo and soap, etc that she will have to account for? Or will be spend money like a teenager, run out too quickly, and then call you and need more money asap (where if she missed the finance lesson above, she may not realize she can\u2019t always get that right away)? \n\nIt sounds like she may not be 100% sure in her decision.

Make it where she can talk to you about things. Just listen. Tell her you will support her no matter what. Tell her it\u2019s okay to be nervous or anxious about her decision. Hell, she might even feel that you are pushing her out because of your focus on the practical side of things. And her comment is an attempt to get you to focus on the emotional side. \n\nThis is a great learning opportunity for you both-she gets the practical life stuff, you get to understand her emotions, and you both can build a closer bond during what is an exciting, nerve wracking time. \n\nCongrats to your daughter!", "Agree with this. You can just let her know that you will not be doing X bank stuff currently, the delays will create Y consequences, so she should prepare to do Z. \n\nHey hon, we'll wait for you to tell us where you're going to do bank stuff.

Also, if she wants a suite type (private bedroom, shared bath), those go fast.\n2. Sign up for courses the absolute moment registration opens. Mandatory courses fill up fast. Waiting even one day may make your schedule inconvenient, two days may make it impossible.\n\nNow it is true she can do this without telling you her decision, but if she wants you to write a check for her deposit she has to tell you who to make it out to. She got in multiple places, so she knows that already. Give her a couple of days to enjoy her secret. After all, this may be the biggest decision she has ever made on her own, so let her enjoy dipping her toe into the \"adulting\" thing.", "Why would any college bound person who's dependent on someone else's money for school think it's \"fun\" to not say where they want to attend? Are you sure she's not actually 8 and not 18?", "Would've said no one is TA here if it weren't for your kid saying \"she thinks it\u2019s fun she got on our nerves about this.\" That's an AH move right there. It would be one thing if she wanted to get a surprise together soon or something but she's doing it bc she thinks it's fun to get on your nerves? Absolutely not. You are NTA. You're trying to help provide for her. She's about to be an adult. She needs some more maturity and understand that while serious can be light-hearted, they also need to be taken seriously at the same time.", "If she\u2019s showing you that she\u2019s not mature enough to handle making adult decisions, maybe rethink allowing her to move away from home. Maybe she\u2019d like to start off with a year or two in a community college? NTA.", "YTA. Really? She just wanted a few days. And if the 'best' housing is already taken by those who moved faster, guess what? it only affects HER. She is on the cusp of adulthood, give her til the end of the week like she asked.", "NTA. But if she keeps this up, she\u2019s going to end up in a triple or a lounge", "Let her pay for everything.", "NTA. Time to cut the apron strings, and let her realize real world consequences.

It just seems like some very bad joke with actual consequences.", "Your daughter is acting ridiculously. You aren\u2019t the AH unless you want to take credit for the spoiled girl you\u2019ve raised.

Passive aggressive for all of it.", "NTA. A bunch of people here (likely college aged or just out of college themselves and not middle aged parents like some of us lol) saying consequences will be on *her* if she waits. No, sorry. They will more than likely be on you. It sounds like you are paying for everything so any financial consequences will be yours. Housing is no longer available because she waited to accept? Guess what? Now you are paying for an apartment vs student housing, ETA: then you are paying for a car so she can drive from that off campus housing to her classes, then you are paying for gas, then you are paying for parking permits... It's impossible to predict how far this could go. You can suggest she get a job or contribute, but if you are enrolling her and agreeing to pay, she actually has no ownership of the financial end of this decision making. Her wanting to tell you today vs the end of the week as a \"surprise\" is actually completely irrelevant. A surprise is still a surprise today...or next Friday, or any other day, but there are additional factors that make waiting a terrible idea. GL!", "NTA. She seems immensely spoiled and unable to comprehend the extent of what you are doing for her because she is too absorbed with herself.", "No, you know you're not the AH. And are totally entitled to tell her in no uncertain terms that if she expects you to pay you expect to know about her decision STAT. Also, why do students think that this is an exciting suspense thing that has everyone at the edge of their seat... This is the exact time in their lives when they can start acting like reasonable adults.", "NTA.\n\nShe is having fun holding back her decision.\n\nTell you too enjoy games too. So every day until she makes a decision, she and you are going to roll dice.\n\n* If you win, you get to take one her choices off the board. And to make it fun, you won\u2019t tell her which choice it is, which will placed in a sealed envelope\n\n* If she wins, she gets to pick an envelope  to tear up. \n\n* To give you an edge, any time you role a pair, you always win.

I ended up making myself sick with the stress of it all. I still wouldn\u2019t have thought it was \u201cfunny\u201d to frustrate my parents by with-holding info about it.

Also any delays with you having the funds in place as moving some funds can take several weeks. \n\nIf the plan has always been for her to be in dorm housing you might also remind her of that and there is no plan to pay for an apartment. \n\nGood to learn the lesson of actions have consequences (aka f*** around and find out) earlier than later in life.  \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA. Your daughter is tugging at your emotions to see how far she can take you. College is a huge step, she\u2019s probably nervous but is also wondering where you are emotionally. However, it\u2019s time for her to grow into her decision. Don\u2019t be emotional, simply tell her that now that her decision is made, financial issues must be resolved next; by refusing to disclose her choice, she\u2019s risking her housing and other plans since everything is now a competition.

Do with that information what you please.", "I am in the same position as you.  I told my son that everyone has put in an application for housing.

Hopefully you make a move to assist her with that realization and she is a bit more considerate in the future.", "NTA. Calmly lay out specifically why you need to know, the consequences based on the choices she makes and why.

I'd also throw in a line about it being hurtful because of the time and effort you've put into making sure whatever college she goes to is a good fit.
