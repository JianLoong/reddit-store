It meant a lot to my friends and I as throughout our college years I was like their dad friend, in a system of chosen family. It meant a lot to me cause before I fixed it up, it was the truck I slept in when my parents kicked me out. I promised this truck to my nephew 10 years ago. \n\nI didn\u2019t come from much. And I\u2019ve found myself blessed with a good house and a wife I absolutely adore. We are having a baby much sooner than expected and I want money to send the kid to the \u201cnice\u201d day care that I pass on my way to work. The one that teaches sign language and works with animals/gardening. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my wife\u2014she knows I love my truck. I didn\u2019t tell friends\u2014I sold it and made a good bit of money to put a down payment on a more reasonable car for a baby, the kind my wife has wanted (her car is beat up she deserves a new one), day care, and some money for college if the kid wants to go/ends up going. Or just starting as an adult money. \n\nMy friends got upset that they won\u2019t be riding in it anymore. Worried I won\u2019t be hanging out with them anymore and think my wife put me up to it. \n\nMy wife cried and told me I shouldn\u2019t have sold my truck. That she doesn\u2019t need a new car (not true her blinker doesn\u2019t even work, lights pushed in, the poor thing is barely holding on). She swears its cosmetic but she regularly struggles to accept gifts.  \n\nMy nephew is devastated. I showed him mechanics on the truck. Spent time with him after his father died by driving him around and taking him to museums, camping, in that truck. I tried to tell him it is time for a new chapter. That I made that promise when I was his age and that I need to do this for my own kid. \n\nMy sister refuses to stop calling me a family traitor. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: users asked for edits. \n1. I was 16 when I made the promise. I was kicked out cause of my gender and disowned/financially on my own. Was homeless. \n2. I asked my nephew twice if he wanted to buy it. Jan and June. Warned him that it wouldn\u2019t stay for sale long as people have made offers and the offers kept going up. \n3. The head start YMCA tuition free daycare got shut down and replaced with a charter school for older kids. Therefore leaving two private school day care options. The nice co-op daycare or the nice international language day care. The other YMCA is too far for me to bring any kiddo to before my work shifts. I\u2019d like for the kid to experience daycare at least one or two days of the week.\n\nEdit: I took care of my nephew and his sisters growing up and throughout my 20s. I made sure they went to orientations. I gave them baths. I held them when they had the shakes as babies being born with withdrawal from drugs. I held my nephew and made sure he got therapy after his dad died. I made sure he got into college. \n\nSome have suggested that I tossed my nephew aside for my \u201creal child\u201d. No. I parented him when I was a child and made mistakes that my 26 year old self wouldn\u2019t do. I see this as older brother (so him as my child) doesn\u2019t get the truck cause it needs to be sold so (younger sibling) gets day care.", "created_utc": 1667412252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykca7d/aita_for_selling_my_truck_that_i_promised_my/", "score": 1023, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know why you are getting so many YTAs here but your wife is about to requires tens of thousands of dollars worth of medical treatments over the next 9 months and childcare is expensive along with all the other costs of infants like big ticket items (cribs exc) needed for saftey reasons. Diapers wipes and formula...hundreds a month. A safe car for transporting a newborn....a necessity not a luxury.", "NTA.\n\nYou have an obligation to your child, and an offer you made as a kid is not a binding life-long promise. Yeah, the nephew's going to be upset, but you gave an option to buy it.\n\nYour sister is the biggest AH of all in this story. How dare she call you a \"family traitor\" for not giving away something when you needed to sell it to provide for your family. She sounds horrible and disgustingly entitled.", "NTA\n\nyou were 16 when you made the promise, and you updated it recently and gave him a chance to buy it, things change, that\u2019s life, everybody needs to settle down", "Lmao. Anyone who voted Y T A must be a student. You have no obligation to give your nephew or anyone else a thing. \n\nNTA at all. Soft AH for not letting them potentially buy it by giving them the option but sounds like they wouldn\u2019t have anyway. \n\nAlways look out for yourself and your immediate family.", "If it is any consolation perhaps you could offer to help your nephew restore a classic truck of his own, and then he will make similar memories to that like you fondly remember from your truck and it may lessen the sting that he feels after you sold it. NTA", "NTA. He said no twice when you asked. Daycare is not free people. Daycare is literally thousands of dollars a year. You are putting your child above a truck and that is a good parent. Like you said your wife needed a new car that is safe.", "NTA. Welcome to fatherhood, in which you do anything necessary to give your child the life you want him to have, sign language and all. Your friends can pound sand. \n\nYour nephew is another story. I\u2019m guessing he built a relationship with you around that truck, and he looked forward to having it, not having to buy a car, and remembering your experiences together in it. Disappointing him doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Life happens. Circumstances change. Explain your thinking, offer another relationship building experience. You can still go camping etc in a different vehicle. When he\u2019s ready, maybe he\u2019ll play the same role for your son as you did for him. \n\nYou should have told your wife you were selling the truck, because that\u2019s how marriages work. Again, doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Makes you human. Apologize, promise to never do it again, then don\u2019t break that promise. \n\nI think you made a bunch of people unhappy here, but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "On what planet do we take the word of a SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD over what is already a very ancient car? I honestly need to know what is going through your sister's head. What would have happened if someone crashed into the vehicle and it was totaled? What would she have said? And based on my parent's experience with their truck, the insurance company was more than happy to send it to the scrap yard when someone rear-ended them. Ten years is a significant amount for any \"promise.\" Global, economic, and family structures change. Now I am of the opinion that you should have never promised your nephew something this big, however, your sister is also one heck of a fool to assume that you would constantly give to your nephew and never have kids of your own eventually. \n\nFollowing you offered to sell your nephew the vehicle. If he really wanted it he would have bought it but he didn't and passed it up. That's on him. He had the chance to get the vehicle. So honestly his complaints are invalidated right there. Not everything is free. He just learned that the hard way. Generosity has its limits, especially when one has a baby that they need to support and care for. It was generous of you to offer him the sale of the vehicle before anyone else, you didn't blindside him. Especially in today's economic climate. \n\nI'll also briefly add here, I was \"promised\" two vehicles until we realized they were dying horrible deaths. There is always an alternative. \n\nYour friends can simply get over it. Yes, nostalgia and memories are fun but again life goes on. If you're caught up in the past it will run you over. It took me years to learn that lesson. There are other things to do. \n\nRealistically priorities have changed. Your wife's car sounds like it's starting its way out the door. I have dealt with two of my father's vehicles gradually dying or needing constant repairs for them to be operational. At one point it is less expensive to get a new car than to continuously send it in for constant repairs. We just had to trade in a vehicle as repairs were beginning to start monthly (and gas prices are extreme) It sounds like this was an important safety concern to both you and your wife. \n\nNTA \n\nP.S please do not make any more promises concerning property.

How could you be proud of yourself if your child is in an unsafe car, or you know is getting subpar daycare.", "NTA - you did what was best for your family. My advice? Keep the info of the person you sold it too, pass that on to your nephew, maybe he can buy it back if REALLY wants it that badly?", "NTA. You were 16 at the time the promise was made.

You are doing it for a good reason, helping your wife and child. Does it suck for your nephew? Yes, it does. But sometimes things happen that force you to break promises like that. Which is why you should avoid ever doing that again. Its Ok to think about it or even plan for it without letting the other person know.

You made a rash promise when you were 16, and you could have explained to them both why you have changed your mind.  Would that change their feelings about it?  Maybe, however you could have also apologized then.  Fact remains that they likely couldn't have afforded the price you got.  And that for you this was a practical decision.   YOU most definitely need to discuss ANY big purchase with your wife prior to making it.  Sure your property prior to marriage and what you do with your property is your decision, but you are a team now and that includes any decision regarding such a big purchase as the car.  I completely understand the safer car argument, however my husband tried ONCE to buy me a car by bringing it home without any advance notice and got the keys thrown at him and the car was returned ASAP.  I felt we couldn't afford the car payment and eventually he agreed that I was correct on that one.  We got the second vehicle later, when it did fit our budget.\n\nAre you mechanically inclined?  Is there a way you could help your nephew find a fixer upper car that you can BOTH invest time and some money into so that he does eventually create his own memories with for himself?

Not good.", "YTA.\n\nSold it for convenience without talking about it with anyone. Didn't offer it to nephew or sister first; maybe you could have agreed on a payment plan.

I\u2019m going to go ahead and continue to believe what the post says, which in sum and substance is that the car was beat up. You can keep feeling around in the dark to justify calling this a luxury as if the guy bought a Lamborghini to ghost ride off a cliff. \n\nMeanwhile, you read the daycare part of the post with a strangulating literalism. The fact that it teaches ASL is an illustration - the point was that it was a nicer daycare. Which still isn\u2019t a luxury compared to a classic car for a teenager. Which you still haven\u2019t addressed. \n\nI\u2019m good here I think.", "Tbh it doesn't matter when OP first started thinking about it because the fact remains that he now has a baby on the way and needs the money. Simple facts, and a silly promise made as a 16 year old does not trump that. I'm kinda side eyeing anyone who thinks that it should tbh.", "that\u2019s so entitled. they\u2019ve both grown up surely as an adult they can understand adult responsibilities and a need for adult money", "But a man taking care of his family isn\u2019t", "Everyone gets sentimental about their old truck. Or their first muscle car. But it\u2019s not realistic to keep those vehicles around indefinitely. It\u2019s a truck, not a scrapbook. Write a country song and move on.", "I say it because I was the one who helped my nephew apply to college and get scholarships. I was the one who picked him up when other kids were bullying him in that truck. He will always have that. Yes, he lost the truck. That\u2019s what I mean by time, energy, the memories. He will always have those memories. If I had the money I would give it but I don\u2019t. This idea of working your butt off? I did too. I was homeless because of my family kicking me out. I still made time for\nSchool, my nephew and nieces, my responsibilities. I put myself through school and I have a job. I work hard too. Doesn\u2019t always mean money. \n\nYou seem to be taking your Daddy issues out on me. And making assumptions about how I feel and saying I don\u2019t care about my nephew but I would give the world to that boy if I could.", "Oh, you're getting some unasked for advice here - look at secondhand and resale shops for clothes for as long as possible. People overbuy kid's clothes all the time and you can find truly brand new clothes, often still with original tags, for a fraction of the retail price. Don't cheap out on diapers though - once you find a brand that works well, stick with it. \n\nYou and your wife are going to be amazing parents!", "As I\u2019ve said\u2026you\u2019re making good decisions.", "It might be a coincidence, but only one of my 3 children went to preschool (I am a SAHM) and that is the child who now does the best in school.", "Why was it necessary to sell the truck to pay for it? I'm not asking why preschool is necessary, though I think some of the extras at this preschool may not be strictly necessary. But I am asking why it wasn't affordable without selling something you promised to someone else.", "But he wanted the money before he needed it for his family. He even talks about having money for his retirement. And it does matter when OP decided to go back on his promise, because that's what this threat is about. OP paints himself better by adding the baby, altough he went back on his promise way before.", "The nephew is 16...\n\nAnd what is entitled about the expectation that the relatives that claim to be all over you keep their promises?", "I literally just agreed with you that the man should not give up the truck and should take care of his family.\n\nWhat he does in the present doesn't change what he did in the past.", "I am making a guess at how you feel based on your post. I'm also empathizing with both you since I fully get what it's like to be trust into default dad position because your sister had a kid with a guy who wasnt there and how much that sucks when it happens before you entered junior high and your nephew because I was that kid who soaked up every bit of attention his uncle could give him because that was the closest you got to a dad in your life. You want to try to push that off as daddy issues because I'm not coming down on your side fine.\n\nBut your nephew is devistated by your own words. You know that the truck mattered deeply to him. You haven't seemed to forgotten your promise to him. So knowing all of that you can't seem to grasp why you'd be the asshole here? This was a stab to your nephew who was expecting a relic (using it in the mythical literary sense of the world) that he'd have and treasure. He'd possibly take his kids in and talk about how uncle you helped him fix this and pat some door he helped you pull the ding out of when you got it back from the junk yard. It was tangible proof of being loved which while it doesn't really matter since the love is still there matters because humans are weird like that.", "My wife is disabled and works but only part time. I would love to afford for her to be stay at home. But for now we need someone to watch a kid for at least a few days each week. I heard on NPR about countries that have free day care and how much more intelligent and empathetic the kids are. I want that for US kids.", "Because I don\u2019t make enough money. My wife works part time. I commented elsewhere\u2014she is disabled. I\u2019m a professor at a community college. The money just isn\u2019t there. What I can save up will go to hospital fees and nursery costs. Diapers, etc. I just don\u2019t get paid enough to afford day care without an extra boost.", "1. No adult should be held to a promise they made as a sixteen year old. \n2. No adult should be held to a promise they made as a sixteen year old when they have a baby on the way.\n\nOP is double NTA. Also, I have no idea what threat you're talking about, OP isn't threatening anyone. OP's question is about whether they're TA for selling the truck and the answer is no, NTA.", "OP offered to sell it to the nephew on two occasions. He had his chance.", "Bro bffr, a promise made by a 16yo isn\u2019t that serious. He has a family to take care of", "So the nephew being 16 means he is too young to understand adult problems, but OP is supposed to keep a promise he made at 16? \n\nThe math isnt mathing", "But you didn\u2019t agree that he\u2019s not AH so I commented back what about this doesn\u2019t make him AH", "Let me ask you something. Have you ever been homeless?", "Yeah, I misspelled thread, what a horror...  \nOP asked if he is TA for selling the truck although he made the promise, but he excludes the fact that he broke his promise before he even knew he would have a baby. He was fine with it for almost 10 years, and then suddenly changed his mind and aksed nephew for market price (in January, Pregnancy was in September), so this is a totally different story.", "OP offered to sell it at market value, first time in january, after promising it as a GIFT!  \nHow many 16 year old do you know having that amount of money at hand?", "Right, but he still left his nephew believe that he would get the truck until recently. So while he made the promise when he was 16, he was an adult for most of the time he let his nephew believe in the promise.", "OP changed his mind in January, but didn't find out about the pregnancy until September.", "No and?"]}
