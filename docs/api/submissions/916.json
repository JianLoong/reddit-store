It meant a lot to my friends and I as throughout our college years I was like their dad friend, in a system of chosen family. It meant a lot to me cause before I fixed it up, it was the truck I slept in when my parents kicked me out. I promised this truck to my nephew 10 years ago. \n\nI didn\u2019t come from much. And I\u2019ve found myself blessed with a good house and a wife I absolutely adore. We are having a baby much sooner than expected and I want money to send the kid to the \u201cnice\u201d day care that I pass on my way to work. The one that teaches sign language and works with animals/gardening. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my wife\u2014she knows I love my truck. I didn\u2019t tell friends\u2014I sold it and made a good bit of money to put a down payment on a more reasonable car for a baby, the kind my wife has wanted (her car is beat up she deserves a new one), day care, and some money for college if the kid wants to go/ends up going. Or just starting as an adult money. \n\nMy friends got upset that they won\u2019t be riding in it anymore. Worried I won\u2019t be hanging out with them anymore and think my wife put me up to it. \n\nMy wife cried and told me I shouldn\u2019t have sold my truck. That she doesn\u2019t need a new car (not true her blinker doesn\u2019t even work, lights pushed in, the poor thing is barely holding on). She swears its cosmetic but she regularly struggles to accept gifts.  \n\nMy nephew is devastated. I showed him mechanics on the truck. Spent time with him after his father died by driving him around and taking him to museums, camping, in that truck. I tried to tell him it is time for a new chapter. That I made that promise when I was his age and that I need to do this for my own kid. \n\nMy sister refuses to stop calling me a family traitor. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: users asked for edits. \n1. I was 16 when I made the promise. I was kicked out cause of my gender and disowned/financially on my own. Was homeless. \n2. I asked my nephew twice if he wanted to buy it. Jan and June. Warned him that it wouldn\u2019t stay for sale long as people have made offers and the offers kept going up. \n3. The head start YMCA tuition free daycare got shut down and replaced with a charter school for older kids. Therefore leaving two private school day care options. The nice co-op daycare or the nice international language day care. The other YMCA is too far for me to bring any kiddo to before my work shifts. I\u2019d like for the kid to experience daycare at least one or two days of the week.\n\nEdit: I took care of my nephew and his sisters growing up and throughout my 20s. I made sure they went to orientations. I gave them baths. I held them when they had the shakes as babies being born with withdrawal from drugs. I held my nephew and made sure he got therapy after his dad died. I made sure he got into college. \n\nSome have suggested that I tossed my nephew aside for my \u201creal child\u201d. No. I parented him when I was a child and made mistakes that my 26 year old self wouldn\u2019t do. I see this as older brother (so him as my child) doesn\u2019t get the truck cause it needs to be sold so (younger sibling) gets day care.\n\nEdit: I offered to sell the truck twice to my nephew at a discounted price. Because we were already struggling financially. Then we found out about the pregnancy, so I sold it to the top bidder. \n\nMy wife\u2019s current car breaks down on the interstate. It has some major damage with the internal mechanics that make it not worth what it would cost to fix it. So one day we were talking and I asked her if she could pick a dream car what would it be. She picked a more than reasonable and reliable hatchback with great gas mileage. Not expensive at all. And it\u2019s a car that all of us could fit in (including my nephew). And as others have asked, yes I plan on taking the bus into work. That\u2019s why it\u2019s my wife getting a new car so she can drive the baby around.", "created_utc": 1667412252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykca7d/aita_for_selling_my_truck_that_i_promised_my/", "score": 3112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know why you are getting so many YTAs here but your wife is about to requires tens of thousands of dollars worth of medical treatments over the next 9 months and childcare is expensive along with all the other costs of infants like big ticket items (cribs exc) needed for saftey reasons. Diapers wipes and formula...hundreds a month. A safe car for transporting a newborn....a necessity not a luxury.", "NTA.\n\nYou have an obligation to your child, and an offer you made as a kid is not a binding life-long promise. Yeah, the nephew's going to be upset, but you gave an option to buy it.\n\nYour sister is the biggest AH of all in this story. How dare she call you a \"family traitor\" for not giving away something when you needed to sell it to provide for your family. She sounds horrible and disgustingly entitled.", "NTA\n\nyou were 16 when you made the promise, and you updated it recently and gave him a chance to buy it, things change, that\u2019s life, everybody needs to settle down", "Lmao. Anyone who voted Y T A must be a student. You have no obligation to give your nephew or anyone else a thing. \n\nNTA at all.

NTA", "NTA. He said no twice when you asked. Daycare is not free people. Daycare is literally thousands of dollars a year. You are putting your child above a truck and that is a good parent. Like you said your wife needed a new car that is safe.", "NTA. Welcome to fatherhood, in which you do anything necessary to give your child the life you want him to have, sign language and all. Your friends can pound sand. \n\nYour nephew is another story. I\u2019m guessing he built a relationship with you around that truck, and he looked forward to having it, not having to buy a car, and remembering your experiences together in it. Disappointing him doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Life happens. Circumstances change. Explain your thinking, offer another relationship building experience. You can still go camping etc in a different vehicle. When he\u2019s ready, maybe he\u2019ll play the same role for your son as you did for him. \n\nYou should have told your wife you were selling the truck, because that\u2019s how marriages work. Again, doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Makes you human. Apologize, promise to never do it again, then don\u2019t break that promise. \n\nI think you made a bunch of people unhappy here, but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "On what planet do we take the word of a SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD over what is already a very ancient car? I honestly need to know what is going through your sister's head. What would have happened if someone crashed into the vehicle and it was totaled? What would she have said? And based on my parent's experience with their truck, the insurance company was more than happy to send it to the scrap yard when someone rear-ended them. Ten years is a significant amount for any \"promise.\" Global, economic, and family structures change. Now I am of the opinion that you should have never promised your nephew something this big, however, your sister is also one heck of a fool to assume that you would constantly give to your nephew and never have kids of your own eventually. \n\nFollowing you offered to sell your nephew the vehicle. If he really wanted it he would have bought it but he didn't and passed it up. That's on him. He had the chance to get the vehicle. So honestly his complaints are invalidated right there. Not everything is free. He just learned that the hard way. Generosity has its limits, especially when one has a baby that they need to support and care for. It was generous of you to offer him the sale of the vehicle before anyone else, you didn't blindside him. Especially in today's economic climate. \n\nI'll also briefly add here, I was \"promised\" two vehicles until we realized they were dying horrible deaths. There is always an alternative. \n\nYour friends can simply get over it. Yes, nostalgia and memories are fun but again life goes on. If you're caught up in the past it will run you over. It took me years to learn that lesson. There are other things to do. \n\nRealistically priorities have changed. Your wife's car sounds like it's starting its way out the door. I have dealt with two of my father's vehicles gradually dying or needing constant repairs for them to be operational. At one point it is less expensive to get a new car than to continuously send it in for constant repairs. We just had to trade in a vehicle as repairs were beginning to start monthly (and gas prices are extreme) It sounds like this was an important safety concern to both you and your wife. \n\nNTA \n\nP.S please do not make any more promises concerning property. Save yourselves the headache.", "NTA, i really don't understand all the y t a responses, things change in life, you've got your own little family to take care of now.", "NTA\n\nYou're already being a great dad. Things don't matter. Education and safety do. Your sister (and nephew) are being greedy. They could have bought it (or expressed intent to and worked out a payment plan). Your friends are being immature. \n\nDon't worry about any of it. Things are just things. How could you be proud of yourself if your child is in an unsafe car, or you know is getting subpar daycare.", "NTA - you did what was best for your family. My advice? Keep the info of the person you sold it too, pass that on to your nephew, maybe he can buy it back if REALLY wants it that badly?", "NTA. You were 16 at the time the promise was made. Life happened and you have a child on the way you want the best for. How many of us can say they kept a promise that was made when we were a kid??? Memories are the most important thing. Not belongings. You are investing in YOUR family. You are not a traitor at all.", "NTA. You offered to sell it to him on 2 separate occasions. It doesn't sound like you are in a position to just give it away either. And your wife and child do come first when it comes to finances.", "NTA.

You are doing it for a good reason, helping your wife and child. Does it suck for your nephew? Yes, it does. But sometimes things happen that force you to break promises like that. Which is why you should avoid ever doing that again. Its Ok to think about it or even plan for it without letting the other person know.

You made a rash promise when you were 16, and you could have explained to them both why you have changed your mind.  Would that change their feelings about it?  Maybe, however you could have also apologized then.  Fact remains that they likely couldn't have afforded the price you got.  And that for you this was a practical decision.   YOU most definitely need to discuss ANY big purchase with your wife prior to making it.  Sure your property prior to marriage and what you do with your property is your decision, but you are a team now and that includes any decision regarding such a big purchase as the car.  I completely understand the safer car argument, however my husband tried ONCE to buy me a car by bringing it home without any advance notice and got the keys thrown at him and the car was returned ASAP.  I felt we couldn't afford the car payment and eventually he agreed that I was correct on that one.  We got the second vehicle later, when it did fit our budget.\n\nAre you mechanically inclined?  Is there a way you could help your nephew find a fixer upper car that you can BOTH invest time and some money into so that he does eventually create his own memories with for himself?  He is understandably very upset and your sister doesn't like seeing her baby hurt so you are going to have to figure out something.", "YTA. You broke a promise. Not good.", "YTA.\n\nSold it for convenience without talking about it with anyone. Didn't offer it to nephew or sister first; maybe you could have agreed on a payment plan.

It was more a question because he feels bad for circumstances changing. If he felt it was something he could and wanted to do. Yay. If not. Thats cool too.

I trusted my father more than anyone else in the world and if he was alive today, I would STILL trust him.  It was never about the car, it was the fact that my dad trusted me and respected me enough to tell me the car would eventually be mine.

Math isn't my strong suit though so I may have read it correctly but mathed it incorrectly haha. \n\nI still stand by my point- you weren't obligated to give him the truck. You are *just barely* an adult now anyways, and any promises you made as a child shouldn't be held to. And you can say you were a father figure to your nephew til you're blue in the face but the fact of the matter is *you were a child too* and your sister is dead wrong if she put you in that position. You were the cool older cousin that looked out for your nephew, but now as an adult you're going to be a father to someone. You did what you needed to ensure your child has what they need in life. That was what your sister's and her baby daddy's job was when you made that promise, not teenage you. \n\nEven all that aside, it wasn't like it was a secret- you offered to sell it to your nephew on more than one occasion.

If they receive any government funding, I think they are required to write off a percentage of their bills as charity or something like that?  (Someone who knows better help me out please.  My brain was not prepared to retrieve the minimal knowledge I have on this lol)    \n\nLast, apply for medicaid.  If she is pregnant, she will probably qualify especially if she has an ebt card already.

You're not a traitor, you're realistically trying to provide and support your wife and this coming baby.\n\nDon't worry about everyone else who keeps saying that nasty shit. You got this. <3 I'd definitely look into the recommendations about doing something nice with your nephew, to sort of makeup for the fact of the broken promise. It would be selfish and entitled for them to not understand, given your situation.", "Ooof. I feel everyone's hurt here. It must have hurt you too to sell it considering it has so much memories tied to it. But yes, NTA. If the nephew couldn't (or wouldn't, idk their financial situation) buy it from you in time, it's okay to sell it when you have a child on the way.

Not when I can put a couple hundred into a payment plan for a different car with less issues.", ">So saving something to give to a nephew that you promised to sell them\n\nFirst it was to be a gift. Not a sale.\n\nSecond I didn't suggest anything like you've just claimed. But go ahead, read my words and make up a wild story about what I never said. Your passive aggression is unnecessary.\n\nI said it's a shame it was sold because it sounds many, many people had an emotional/sentimental connection to it. Them, their wife, their friends and their nephew. And it's a shame it was sold because it's the kind of thing family traditions are born out of - it would have been a lovely one to start with.\n\nAnd the key is next - where I said NEEDS MUST. I am still allowed to empathise with the nephew for losing something he was sentimentally attached to and had memories of growing up with, especially as it seems OP was somewhat like a father figure to him after he'd lost his own. Nephew obviously can't afford it so the offer to sell is irrelevant. Seems a lot of others had sentimental memories too so it's sad but NEEDS MUST and they had to sell it to pay for those needs.\n\nI also said I hope they and their nephew can move on from the vehicle sale and make new memories together. They are a slight AH for not keeping the promise because they may have been 16 when they promised but it's now 10 years later. They and nephew could have figured something out over 10 years. But I recognise why this was necessary and that they havent abandoned their nephew, so definitely no Y-T-A from me, and I stand by my decision of NAH.\n\nOP As you nentioned being kicked our for your gender I've tried to keep everything gender neutral in my comments except \"father figure\" because it seems you replaced some of the role his dad would have as nephew grew up.
