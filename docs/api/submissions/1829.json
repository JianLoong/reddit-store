She searched on Pinterest, found one she liked (a skull with roses) and I supported her until she asked me to get a matching one.

She got very mad and told me I\u2019m a selfish asshole because I couldn\u2019t compromise to do something that would make her feel better about herself.

NTA", "NTA. Nobody gets to pressure you into making permanent changes to your body, not even your spouse. Your reasons for not getting it are completely reasonable.", "Trying to push you into getting a tattoo completely violates your body autonomy. She has ZERO right to tell you what to tattoo or to do it at all. It\u2019s a highly personal choice. I have them. I wouldn\u2019t dream of pushing them onto someone else. \n\nIf I were you I wouldn\u2019t be asking myself if I\u2019m the AH, I\u2019d be pretty furious with her for that. You should be asking yourself why you feel like you might be the AH. You sound pretty browbeaten, honestly. NTA.", "NTA.  No one should be forced to get a tattoo they don't want.  Please encourage your wife to get some therapy to deal with her trauma.  Whether you have a tattoo will not in any way impact the way she feels about herself.", "NTA\n\nYou were being supportive of her getting the tattoo to make herself feel better. She's crossing a line by demanding you get a tattoo as a sign of support. Tattoos are not easy things to get as they cause pain regardless of where you have them and they are very difficult to remove. It's not like cutting your hair to show solidarity to a cancer victim (which is also optional) since hair can grow back. Once the tattoo is there, it's there unless you get essentially surgery to remove it. \n\nAnd I think you're right about being worried about the potential impact on your career. In a perfect world, it wouldn't matter if a lawyer had tattoos, but it does really matter to some people and could lose you clients.\n\nShe may be reacting emotionally and might be willing to have a real conversation once she has calmed down about how you support her in her tattoo journey but are not willing to get one yourself for your already stated reasons. If she pulls this emotional manipulation all the time, though, I would be a lot more concerned.", "NTA it's your body and you're absolutely right that it could have a negative impact on your career. Just because she likes that particular tattoo for herself doesn't mean you want it on your body as well. I certainly don't have the same taste as my girlfriend and wouldn't want to be asked to wear her clothing indefinitely a tattoo is no different.", "It\u2019s your body, you shouldn\u2019t have to do something you don\u2019t want to do because of her. Something you could suggest to her is matching clothes or something, not anything permanent.", "Your body, your choice.", "As someone with a relatively recent, big ol scar on my wrist from a near fatal workplace injury, NTA tattoos are super personal and you should never be compelled to get something like that.", "NTA. Even if it might not have a negative impact on your career you are nta about your choice what you do with your body.", "Nta\n\nShe's going to have to square that scar on her wrist with herself and not drag you into it. \n\nIt was fine to ask but not fine to berate you. She's a giant AH for that.", "Confused as to how you not liking tattoos and not wanting them on your skin is \u2018not supporting\u2019 her. \n\nIf she wants the tattoo to commemorate a major event in her life, that\u2019s great for her. But that doesn\u2019t mean that she gets to demand that you get one too. \n\nNTA", "NTA. A tattoo is a major thing to do to your body. No one should be guilted into it.", "NTA - her self-image should have nothing to do with you, your body or what 's on it.", "Whaaaat? No you are NTA, shes being selfish and inconsiderate. It\u2019s her choice of a tattoo. What is wrong with your wife? Newsflash if the tattoo will make her feel better about herself what does that have to do with your body?", "NTA. I\u2019m someone who is covered in tattoos and I just want to say\u2026. If you don\u2019t want a tattoo there is no earthly reason anyone should be trying to guilt you into one. Memorial tattoo, matching to make them feel better, just because they want you to, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s your body and if you don\u2019t want one I\u2019d rather you not get one because god knows us tattooed people don\u2019t need more people out there preaching about tattoo regret and how after getting one they\u2019d never recommend them to anyone lol. No, be responsible. If you don\u2019t want it then don\u2019t get it. \n\nYour wife needs to put more thought into it too, because it seems she is expecting it to instantly make her feel better. And to me that sounds like a mistake/ regret waiting to happen. \n\nIf she decides to get one it\u2019s her choice. But if she can\u2019t see herself getting one unless other people do too\u2026. Then that seems like an issue.", "Oh, this one is so easy.\n\nNTA. Your body, your choice.", "NTA, yes, she's self conscious of her scar, which happened suddenly and traumatically, but the tattoo has meaning to HER not you.", "NTA - It\u2019s your body. You shouldn\u2019t get anything etched onto it unless you fully and enthusiastically consent to it.\n\nThis is your wife\u2019s insecurity, and it\u2019s fully her choice how she deals with it. Getting a tattoo could be a form of reclaiming part of her body and could be very helpful to her healing. But your body isn\u2019t involved at all in her trauma or her healing. She can do whatever she needs to feel comfortable in her body again, but that ends at her own body. At no time is she able to dictate or control your body. She needs to respect your choices and boundaries.", "NTA, your body your choice. Lawyers can have tattoos tho I think lawyers with tats are cool! But you gotta be the kinda lawyer who would get a tattoo and if that ain\u2019t you that\u2019s life. I\u2019d say \u201cthems the breaks\u201d but post accident maybe too soon? XD", "NTA. Tattoos are permanent and no one, I repeat NO ONE should ever be forced or pressured into getting one for any reason ever. Her insecurity about her scar is hers alone. You can support her by accompanying her to get the tattoo but do not get one yourself.", "NTA. As for you getting a tattoo to make your wife feel better about herself- doesn\u2019t work like that. Feeling better about oneself is an internal job that no-one else can do for you. \n\nAnd as others have said, getting a tattoo is very personal and just a bit permanent\u2026 nothing one can demand another person to get.\n\nShe might not be an AH, she might just be wrapped up in her own felt needs. But it comes across as AH.", "NTA. It's your body and you don't like tattoos.", "NTA. Your wife chose a risky hobby and was hurt. That is unfortunate. You supporting her has nothing to do with marking your body. Her tattoo idea was a good one if that helps her, but making you join her is faulty logic.", "NTA \n\nYour wife's choice to cover a scar with a tattoo is her decision. \n\nWhy she demands that you need to get matching tattoo to show support is a bit bizarre. There are many ways that you can/do support your spouse.\n\nWhatever your reasons, the bottom line is that it is not something that you're not interested in doing. \n\nYou didn't comment to your wife, one way or the other, based on your post, to your wife about her choice to cover her scar-or how to cover it. You supported her decision.", "NTA.\n\nIt's great that she found a way to cope with the insecurities stemming from having a scar after the accident, but your wife can't expect you to also have to get a tattoo.\n\nIt's her scar, and it's going to be her tattoo to cover it up. You are not being selfish by not wanting to get a tattoo, she is being selfish for arguing that you should.", "Nope nope nope. Wife is wrong here. Doesn't matter how much she went to, she has NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER to demand you permanently mark yourself in solidarity.\n\nShe is welcome to get a tattoo herself without consulting you. You are welcome to not do that. She's upset about the tattoo, but more importantly she is probably upset about the entire situation regarding her scar. \n\nNAH because this is more than just her being demanding, there is trauma involved and some leeway should be offered as she comes to terms with the damage happening to her body.\n\nWere I in your shoes, I'd text her *\"I love you more than anything, and I'm sorry about all that has happened to you during and after this accident. I support you getting a tattoo, or anything else you want to do to help you feel right again. But I hope you also love me and understand me enough to know that me not wanting a tattoo isn't a betrayal. I have final say over my body just as you do, and I wouldn't ask you to do something to yourself that you were uncomfortable with. Just as I hope you wouldn't ask me the same. I love you, please come home whenever you feel ready. I genuinely want to talk through this and see how else I can be here for you.\"*", "NTA - It's your body. *And*, you're a lawyer so you know well enough the odds of marriage vs divorce, would you really want a matching tattoo like that *forever*?", "NTA, tattoos are a deeply personal decision. Also it's generally a bad idea to tattoo over a scar.", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA.  Your body, your choice, period.", "NTA. She was within reason to ask. You were within reason to decline. At that point, it should have been over. She needs to respect your body autonomy.", "NTA\n\nAs a lawyer you should know her last statement, Compromise with a permanent mark to make ME feel good is a rotten argument!  It's your body, your decision and this is a \"her\" problem.", "NTA \n\nPartner tattoos are always a bad idea. And reason Nr. 1 for laser removal. It's sensible not to get one. \n\nAnd she really shouldn't dictate a life-long modification of /your/ body. This is your decision and she must respect what you want to do with your body.", "\"I\u2019m starting to think that maybe I should have just went along with the tattoo thing if it was so important to her.\"\n\nBS.  I refuse to get a tattoo for similar reasons.  I will not be guilt tripped into getting one by anyone.  NTA.  Stick to your guns.", "NTA. You and you alone get to decide what goes on or in your body.  It\u2019s a concept known as bodily autonomy.  It\u2019s important.  Did your wife sustain a head injury/concussion in this accident and is her behavior odd or unusual?  Just something to think about if her behavior is new.  Head injuries are no joke.  :/", "NTA \n\nit your body if you don't want a tattoo then don't get one", "NTA. I've got the gut feeling that your 1-year-long marriage isn't gonna last long. Your bodily autonomy is more important, tattoos aren't welcome in the legal setting. She wants to use you and mutilate your skin so that she's in the same boat as you. Red flags, don't avoid them.", "NTA - being supportive of each other doesn't mean guilt tripping someone into doing something they don't want to do.  If anything, she is the one being the selfish asshole - it's a scar - we all get them.", "NTA.  SHE found a tattoo that SHE loves, then expects you to also have that lifelong picture put on your body, and then gets pissed that you don't want the same tattoo.  AH move.  If she needs you to get the tattoo to feel better about herself, then she needs therapy more than a tattoo.", "NTA for not getting one because you choose what happens with your body. You ARE the arsehole for using your job as an excuse though.  Lots of lawyers have tattoos AND if you're in court, you'll be wearing a suit and your arms are likely to be covered.  Don't be so judgemental. No one cares if you have a tattoo.", "Your body, your choice. \n\nI'm sure she wouldn't like it if you demanded she change a part of her body that would last forever, or be extremely costly to remove. \n\nYou're not obligated to do anything to your body you don't want to. The fact she's calling you an AH over this is something that would honestly make me reconsider my relationship with her. Being disappointed is one thing, but being resentful and calling you names over it is entirely selfish on her part. \n\nNTA and don't give into her silent treatment. She's trying to manipulate and guilt you into doing something you don't want to do. \n\nAnd honestly, if it continues, run.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I have an idea for you- when your wife gets her sketch for the tattoo, have the artist give you a copy. You can send this to jewelry artists, t shirt makers ect (whatever you want).
