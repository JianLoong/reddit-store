Whether you have a tattoo will not in any way impact the way she feels about herself.", "NTA\n\nYou were being supportive of her getting the tattoo to make herself feel better. She's crossing a line by demanding you get a tattoo as a sign of support. Tattoos are not easy things to get as they cause pain regardless of where you have them and they are very difficult to remove. It's not like cutting your hair to show solidarity to a cancer victim (which is also optional) since hair can grow back. Once the tattoo is there, it's there unless you get essentially surgery to remove it. \n\nAnd I think you're right about being worried about the potential impact on your career. In a perfect world, it wouldn't matter if a lawyer had tattoos, but it does really matter to some people and could lose you clients.\n\nShe may be reacting emotionally and might be willing to have a real conversation once she has calmed down about how you support her in her tattoo journey but are not willing to get one yourself for your already stated reasons.

No, be responsible. If you don\u2019t want it then don\u2019t get it. \n\nYour wife needs to put more thought into it too, because it seems she is expecting it to instantly make her feel better. And to me that sounds like a mistake/ regret waiting to happen. \n\nIf she decides to get one it\u2019s her choice. But if she can\u2019t see herself getting one unless other people do too\u2026.

Doesn't matter how much she went to, she has NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER to demand you permanently mark yourself in solidarity.\n\nShe is welcome to get a tattoo herself without consulting you. You are welcome to not do that. She's upset about the tattoo, but more importantly she is probably upset about the entire situation regarding her scar. \n\nNAH because this is more than just her being demanding, there is trauma involved and some leeway should be offered as she comes to terms with the damage happening to her body.\n\nWere I in your shoes, I'd text her *\"I love you more than anything, and I'm sorry about all that has happened to you during and after this accident.

Several of my tattoos can be visible at any given time depending on what I wear. The only people who comment are people asking about them because they like them (the music notes that i got matching with my best friend are especially popular). I know several trial attorneys with tattoos (including full sleeve tattoos) and it's not a hindrance to our careers. They are much more accepted nowadays. \n\nI agree that if OP doesn't want a tattoo, he shouldn't be pressured to get one.", "Would a judge ever go to court without wearing at least a dress shirt though??", "Well those judges are obviously misogynistic jerks. Do they expect female lawyers to never get pregnant or just hide in a shed for nine months so no one sees them while pregnant?", "Perhaps it has to do with your area of the country. Mine was the deep south.", "Viewers sent Lucille OBall hate letters about her daring to be pregnant on television. Apparently a married woman who is playing the part of a married woman with her actual husband as costar is scandalous.\n\nThis actually led to many women hiding pregnancies on shows because studios feared backlash", "They can be very weird about it.", "I live in the south and have argued in my state's Supreme Court.\n\nEdit: and I understand the legal profession in general is more conservative. But certain aspects of that are changing (thankfully)", "Yeah that\u2019s so bizarre. Of course they had the separate beds too", "So gross.", "NTA\n\nIts your body so its your choice if you want one or not but you already made a decision which is you dont want to so instead of her forcing you to get one, she should respect your decision. \n\n>told me I\u2019m a selfish asshole because I couldn\u2019t compromise to do something that would make her feel better about herself\n\nOh but getting herself a tattoo to cover up her scarf will not make her happy? Please show her the replies so that she knows that she cannot force somebody to get a tattoo", "NTA - doesn't sound good if every time you don't do what your wife wants, that she punishes you.  No is a perfectly good answer (something I've learned on Reddit).", "NTA- your body, your choice.\n\nWhen she comes home, reassure your wife that you understand that she is having difficulties with her scar and that you support whatever decision she makes for her body but don't let yourself be pushed in to getting a tattoo that you don't want because of emotional blackmail.", "NTA. Your body your choice. Plus I think she will have a hard time finding someone to tattoo her this soon from the injury. If she just waits a year or two the scar will fade and likely won\u2019t brother her that much if at all then. But either way you have every right to not put a tattoo on your body that you don\u2019t want.", "NTA", "I had a tattoo over 5 year old scar tissue and it was a disaster. Also, if you don\u2019t want a tattoo, don\u2019t do it. I personally regret all of mine.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to make demands of you about your body. \n\nShe\u2019s free to get whatever tattoos she wants. It\u2019s completely unreasonable to think she can demand you get one too.", "Easy NTA, your body, your choice.", "NTA.", "NTA How do you go from supporting your wife to being expected to get a tattoo? That\u2019s ridiculous. She is being unreasonable. It wasn\u2019t life threatening, and she\u2019s just insecure about a scar. Even if I had almost died and spent weeks in an ICU I wouldn\u2019t demand my husband get a tattoo he didn\u2019t want to get lol. Her reaction makes no sense to me.", "Clearly not a litigator, but NTA", "agreed. i have bad keloids all over my arms from self harm. i went to artists that have worked with scars before. also she needs to be prepared for the amount of pain tattooing over scar tissue can cause. plus it might take longer to tattoo because scars don\u2019t take ink as well.", "I've been badly wanting a tattoo to take back part of my body that was scarred when my daughter was stillborn (the doctors and nurses really dropped several balls, and one left me with my entire lower back having a scar about two inches tall that I end up feeling more often than anyone would ever realize) but it's likely to cost more than I could ever afford and honestly I don't even know what the process is like for getting scar tissue inked.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that any tattoo artist worth their salt will not tattoo a picture from Pinterest. It\u2019s better to not be married to the exact picture of someone else\u2019s tattoo you found, and instead talk to the artist about how you want a skull with roses and have them draw you up a custom one. If the artist is willing to tattoo someone else\u2019s design on you, they\u2019re not going to be a good tattoo artist who has a ton of experience tattooing on fragile skin", "I have keloids also, how did your skin react when you got tattoos? I have been debating since I\u2019m worried it may turn out horribly.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happen to you. \n\nIn terms of tattooing scar tissue, it can be done, but you have to be aware that the tissue is wildly unpredictable, and anything super intricate could bleed (not actual blood, but the ink bleeds outside of the lines) not hold, or irritate your scar further and in the worst case, potentially cause keloiding. It\u2019s also worth noting that tattooing scars is generally more painful than tattooing regular skin because the nerves can be pretty fucked. \n\nPersonally, I would find a tattoo artist with a lot of experience specifically in scar cover ups, and be very open to their thoughts on design. At the end of the day, they know more than you, and will have a better ideal of what is realistically going to work with your scarring.", "Thank you.\n\nAnd yeah I'm hoping to find someone who can do their own design, or find something given parameters. I'm an artist myself but since I don't do tattoos and especially don't know about scarred skin I could only give my thoughts. Basically something to show how I walked between life and death for a week."]}
