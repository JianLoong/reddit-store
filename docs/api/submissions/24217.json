She is a really nice girl but she has always acted a little repulsed by boys but she is friends with one boy, however that boy is the only boy in her friend group.\n\nShe would always say things like the boys in her class are dirty. School is out right now but will be starting next month and I was talking to her about whether she is looking forward towards going back. She said she likes her teacher and class but prefers summer and claimed that the boys made fun of her and that it made her sad. I have always tried to teach her to look out for bias in case she only notices it when the boys do dirty things and ignores it when girls do them.\n\nI was obviously concerned and asked her if she ever told her teacher about it and she said no because it happens when teachers are not looking and she does not want to get in trouble for lying.\n\nSo I asked her follow up questions about what they did and she mentioned many things like putting snot in her hair, mocking how she dresses (she likes girly clothes but I am sure many other girls in her class do that too). This seemed almost outrageous and I know kids like to omit the other side of the story so given her views on boys I was suspecting maybe she was also making fun of them.\n\nI asked her if she had done anything to them first and she denied it and if she was sure they were really being mean or just having some fun and being friendly.\n\nShe got upset and ran off and accused me of not believing her and now I feel like an AH. I never said I don't believe her, I just wanted to be sure and try to gather the other side of the story since I assume there was a reason she would not tell her teachers. She has never come back with bruises or anything but sometimes has come back with footprints on her dress which I just assumed were from play and once had gum and glue in her hair.\n\nMy wife is also upset at me and wants to speak to the school.

You're making her out to be some purposeful liar that's unfairly targeting innocent boys with an unfounded sense of bias when the reality is that your daughter *is* being bullied and that her bias against this particular group of boys *is founded AND logical*.\n\nMAJOR YTA and don't be surprised when *both* your wife and daughter start treating you differently and *not* in a good way because of how you're not only treating a very serious situation but also for the fact that your treating your *own daughter* as if she's liar or worse yet, and if it's *her* fault she's being harassed and physically assaulted by those little shts.

She is a really nice girl but she has always acted a little repulsed by boys but she is friends with one boy, however that boy is the only boy in her friend group.\n\nShe would always say things like the boys in her class are dirty. School is out right now but will be starting next month and I was talking to her about whether she is looking forward towards going back. She said she likes her teacher and class but prefers summer and claimed that the boys made fun of her and that it made her sad.\n\nI was obviously concerned and asked her if she ever told her teacher about it and she said no because it happens when teachers are not looking and she does not want to get in trouble for lying.\n\nSo I asked her follow up questions about what they did and she mentioned many things like putting snot in her hair, mocking how she dresses (she likes girly clothes but I am sure many other girls in her class do that too). This seemed almost outrageous and I know kids like to omit the other side of the story so given her views on boys I was suspecting maybe she was also making fun of them.\n\nI asked her if she had done anything to them first and she denied it and if she was sure they were really being mean or just having some fun and being friendly.\n\nShe got upset and ran off and accused me of not believing her and now I feel like an AH. I never said I don't believe her, I just wanted to be sure and try to gather the other side of the story since I assume there was a reason she would not tell her teachers. She has never come back with bruises or anything but sometimes has come back with footprints on her dress which I just assumed were from play and once had gum and glue in her hair.\n\nMy wife is also upset at me and wants to speak to the school. But I do not want to embarrass myself  in case she started it or something.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Worse, there were those who condoned the abuse.

I was your daughter. \n\nI was 14 when the boys in my class spent the afternoon asking me disgusting and disturbing questions (I was in a small school and had all classes with these boys.) Things like did I fuck my brother or did I masturbate my cat. Yes, those actual words. They\u2019re seared into my brain. When we returned to Homeroom, they encircled me. One boy put his hand up my skirt. Another tickled his fingers under my chin and told me \u201cmy dick itches.\u201d \n\nMy male teacher ignored them. When I got on the bus, my head whirling and connecting with the recent Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings, I knew exactly what happened. I said the words aloud to my parents when I returned home. \u201cI was sexually harassed.\u201d \n\nI was told I was being dramatic. What did I do to egg them on? Why didn\u2019t I leave? (Where in the hell would I go?) I was hoping that finally, FINALLY this would be enough for my dad - who always blamed me for the teasing I suffered - would finally be mad enough to stand up for me. He didn\u2019t. *I* got my mom to come with me to tell the principal - a woman - who was utterly useless. She asked me, a child, \u201cwhat do you want me to do?\u201d And I hung my head and said \u201cnothing\u201d because every damn adult failed me. My mom didn\u2019t want to rock the boat. My dad didn\u2019t believe me. The principal was an idiot. \n\nI never, ever forgot that. It took me years to realize that while my dad loves me and has done a lot for me, he has never nor will ever put himself out there on my behalf. Whatever negative scenarios, bullies, or abusers enter my life, it will always be my fault somehow. I did something to deserve it, for not being perfect enough, not \u201cnormal\u201d enough, not \u2026 whatever. I\u2019ve spent four decades trying to prove to him that I\u2019m not an idiot, that I\u2019m a good person, that I\u2019m worth defending. It\u2019s taken a lot of work, therapy and self-reflection to ensure that poison doesn\u2019t drip on my daughter.\n\nSo, I ask you OP, is that what you want your little girl to remember about you? The times she needed her dad to stand up for her, you gave her bullshit both-sidesism?Bias?! WTF? She notices things because they bother her. She\u2019s not making shit up or pushing some agenda. She\u2019s your fucking daughter and she\u2019s scared and upset. She wants her dad\u2019s help and you\u2019re telling her she\u2019s not worth it by interrogating her to figure out how she\u2019s at fault. How does that not move you as one of two human beings who created her? \n\nYou wanna know what happened next? The first man in my life to stand up for me was a boyfriend.
