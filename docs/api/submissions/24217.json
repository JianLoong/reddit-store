She is a really nice girl but she has always acted a little repulsed by boys but she is friends with one boy, however that boy is the only boy in her friend group.\n\nShe would always say things like the boys in her class are dirty. School is out right now but will be starting next month and I was talking to her about whether she is looking forward towards going back. She said she likes her teacher and class but prefers summer and claimed that the boys made fun of her and that it made her sad. I have always tried to teach her to look out for bias in case she only notices it when the boys do dirty things and ignores it when girls do them.\n\nI was obviously concerned and asked her if she ever told her teacher about it and she said no because it happens when teachers are not looking and she does not want to get in trouble for lying.\n\nSo I asked her follow up questions about what they did and she mentioned many things like putting snot in her hair, mocking how she dresses (she likes girly clothes but I am sure many other girls in her class do that too). This seemed almost outrageous and I know kids like to omit the other side of the story so given her views on boys I was suspecting maybe she was also making fun of them.\n\nI asked her if she had done anything to them first and she denied it and if she was sure they were really being mean or just having some fun and being friendly.\n\nShe got upset and ran off and accused me of not believing her and now I feel like an AH. I never said I don't believe her, I just wanted to be sure and try to gather the other side of the story since I assume there was a reason she would not tell her teachers. She has never come back with bruises or anything but sometimes has come back with footprints on her dress which I just assumed were from play and once had gum and glue in her hair.\n\nMy wife is also upset at me and wants to speak to the school.

She is a really nice girl but she has always acted a little repulsed by boys but she is friends with one boy, however that boy is the only boy in her friend group.\n\nShe would always say things like the boys in her class are dirty. School is out right now but will be starting next month and I was talking to her about whether she is looking forward towards going back. She said she likes her teacher and class but prefers summer and claimed that the boys made fun of her and that it made her sad.\n\nI was obviously concerned and asked her if she ever told her teacher about it and she said no because it happens when teachers are not looking and she does not want to get in trouble for lying.\n\nSo I asked her follow up questions about what they did and she mentioned many things like putting snot in her hair, mocking how she dresses (she likes girly clothes but I am sure many other girls in her class do that too). This seemed almost outrageous and I know kids like to omit the other side of the story so given her views on boys I was suspecting maybe she was also making fun of them.\n\nI asked her if she had done anything to them first and she denied it and if she was sure they were really being mean or just having some fun and being friendly.\n\nShe got upset and ran off and accused me of not believing her and now I feel like an AH. I never said I don't believe her, I just wanted to be sure and try to gather the other side of the story since I assume there was a reason she would not tell her teachers. She has never come back with bruises or anything but sometimes has come back with footprints on her dress which I just assumed were from play and once had gum and glue in her hair.\n\nMy wife is also upset at me and wants to speak to the school. But I do not want to embarrass myself  in case she started it or something.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was your daughter. \n\nI was 14 when the boys in my class spent the afternoon asking me disgusting and disturbing questions (I was in a small school and had all classes with these boys.) Things like did I fuck my brother or did I masturbate my cat. Yes, those actual words. They\u2019re seared into my brain. When we returned to Homeroom, they encircled me. One boy put his hand up my skirt. Another tickled his fingers under my chin and told me \u201cmy dick itches.\u201d \n\nMy male teacher ignored them. When I got on the bus, my head whirling and connecting with the recent Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings, I knew exactly what happened. I said the words aloud to my parents when I returned home. \u201cI was sexually harassed.\u201d \n\nI was told I was being dramatic. What did I do to egg them on? Why didn\u2019t I leave? (Where in the hell would I go?) I was hoping that finally, FINALLY this would be enough for my dad - who always blamed me for the teasing I suffered - would finally be mad enough to stand up for me. He didn\u2019t. *I* got my mom to come with me to tell the principal - a woman - who was utterly useless. She asked me, a child, \u201cwhat do you want me to do?\u201d And I hung my head and said \u201cnothing\u201d because every damn adult failed me. My mom didn\u2019t want to rock the boat. My dad didn\u2019t believe me. The principal was an idiot. \n\nI never, ever forgot that. It took me years to realize that while my dad loves me and has done a lot for me, he has never nor will ever put himself out there on my behalf. Whatever negative scenarios, bullies, or abusers enter my life, it will always be my fault somehow. I did something to deserve it, for not being perfect enough, not \u201cnormal\u201d enough, not \u2026 whatever. I\u2019ve spent four decades trying to prove to him that I\u2019m not an idiot, that I\u2019m a good person, that I\u2019m worth defending.

YTA and this definitely won't help her like boys any more, you're just proving her right.", "YTA.  Unless your daughter is a known liar or troublemaker, the skepticism is unfounded.", "Look I can understand wanting to make sure that you\u2019re getting the full truth but in this case there\u2019s more important things at play. Like your daughters trust in you.\n\nEven in the worst case scenario the boys get punished for nothing and at worst it\u2019s a time out or something. But more likely they are actually doing these things and whether she started it or not she needs to feel like you are on her side for the rest of it. \n\nIf you find out later that she lied or did some of these things back to the boys you can punish her for those parts at that time. \n\nThere is no upside to questioning her right to her face as she\u2019s telling you about it. Only hurt feelings and loss of trust. Ask her teachers for a better understanding of the situation, you could even ask the boys parents if you wanted.", "Looking for confirmation is understandable. Trust but verify, as they say. However.\n\n>I asked her if she had done anything to them first and she denied it and if she was sure they were really being mean or just having some fun and being friendly.\n\nWe had a lecture a decade back and one of the examples for victim blaming is similar to this. The story goes, that a woman went to social services to report that her husband beat her in rage. The worker asked, \"Why, what did you do?\" This is subtle, but this is close to classic victim blaming.\n\nAlso.\n\n>She has never come back with bruises or anything but sometimes has come back with footprints on her dress which I just assumed were from play and once had gum and glue in her hair.\n\nThis seems to match her stories. Would you wait for violence before believing her or at least, starting an investigation?\n\nYTA", "is that a case of not all mans? that look for bias commentary was disgusting YTA", "YTA", "YTA", "1. Did you not question her when she had footprints on her dress? Or gum and glue in her hair? \n\n2. Your one of her bullies\n\n3. Seems like you're the one with a bias\n\n4. Have you asked why she thinks boys are dirty or just tell her to not be bias? \n\nYou're a complete asshole.", "Man literally saw the gum and glue and still didnt believe her, who tf thinks putting gum in someones hair happens when playing? YTA", "YTA.  Bullying for a 10 year old can be devastating whatever it entails.  She doesn\u2019t have to be physically abused to be bullied.  \n\nGreat job teaching her she can\u2019t trust you to support her.", "YTA\nBoth those things she mentioned sound totally plausible. She came back with physical proof and you still didn\u2019t believe her. I would like to know what game involves footprints on her back.\n\nIt is hard for teachers to see everything going on, and often when something happens they didn\u2019t see it happen and even if they talk to the naughty kid, the behavior continues. So lots of kids give up telling the teacher\n\nYour kid came to you for help and protection and you failed. Massively.\n\nThere are a lot of ways boys can make girls\nSuffer as she gets older. Then you will wonder why she didn\u2019t tell you about it.\n\nAlso at ten it is normal for kids to only hang out with their sex", "YTA. Your reaction to your daughter makes me suspect you bullied others at that age. \n\n>She has never come back with bruises or anything but sometimes has come back with footprints on her dress which I just assumed were from play and once had gum and glue in her hair.\n\nSeriously? Bullies always leave bruises? Some of the biggest bullies don't even touch you. They bully you in non-physical ways. \n\nThe fact that she comes home with footprints on her dress and gum in her hair are pretty good signals that she very might be bullied. I don't know what kind of play, other than bullying \"play\", results in footprint on someone's dress or gum in their hair. \n\n>My wife is also upset at me and wants to speak to the school. But I do not want to embarrass myself in case she started it or something.\n\nAt least she has one reasonable parent.", "YTA. Sounds to me like you were a schoolyard bully. You're trying so hard to justify their actions, you're not listening to your own kid.", "She\u2019s telling you they\u2019re putting snot in her hair and you double checked to make sure they weren\u2019t being friendly? YTA.", "Embarrass yourself for standing up for your daughter?? Don\u2019t worry you\u2019ve already embarrassed yourself by how you handled the situation here. It\u2019s fine to ask questions to get to know what happened but pushing like that and showing you don\u2019t trust her by continuing the probing questions in an already vulnerable situation did not help your case at all. You need to do some research on victim blaming and you owe your daughter a genuine apology.", "\"What did you do to cause it?\" is a classic line that rape apologists use when a woman reports her rape. \n\nYTA. Kids are sneaky and they know to bully their targets behind their teacher's backs *so they won't be seen* and can get away with it. \n\nAnd yet, here you are, grilling your poor child and making her realize that you don't believe her.", "YWBTA if you continue to treat her the way you are. You are the parent. It is your job to advocate for your child which means talking to the school regardless of your fear of embarrassment. The signs of bullying seem to be there by your own admission. Why does she have to prove to you that she doesn\u2019t deserve that treatment? Even if she did say someone was dirty - that doesn\u2019t excuse bullying in return. Let the school know so they can look into it further and keep an eye on her. Worst case scenario in your book seems to be that she\u2019s lying and would embarrass you and not that she is being bullied and abused at school. Maybe reflect on that for a bit of perspective.", "YTA beyond doubt. Can't believe you have to ask even. Your replies make me want to puke.", "YTA 100 times over.\n\nAs a father I have and always will listen to my daughter when she brings up concerns especially when she got picked on by another student. You need to reevaluate your priorities with your daughter because right now, you\u2019re just showing her that one of the most important man in her life doesn\u2019t even support her. Grow a spine and start being a father.", "Absolutely me with the abusive relationship. I let too many people seriously mistreat me as a young adult out of fear of displeasing others and zero sense of deserving any better or having the right to say it wasn't okay. That's gonna be this poor girl in ten years thanks to this asshole.", "She also has an anti boy attitude because her own father doesn't care if she's bullied and thinks it's her fault.", "Repeat the good ol' *boys will be boys* ad nauseum until the day she comes home with a black eye or fat lip, and even then surely she either instigated or was asking for it -OP logic", "I am sorry, but are you friends with the bullies or something? I am just wondering why you are trying so hard to protect them when your daughter comes home with glue in her hair and footprints on her clothes.

Oh right you didn't bully anyone, you were just joking around. Sticks and stones right? How do I know you were the bully and not the bullied? Because you have no fucking clue what the bullied needs or wants, and had like 5 things the kids could have been doing that were all bullying by a different name. I bet you \"had fun\" with a bunch of people you owe apologies.", "Oh, please, stop justifying yourself. You were interrogating her. And if that wasn't your intent, then you need to stop saying, \"Did you do anything to cause this?\" That is the one sentence that is making all of us thinking you don't believe support her. Never, EVER ask a victim of *anything* a question like that again. It's no wonder your wife is pissed. She should be. \n\nDo better.", "I had a friend who was being bullied *by her teacher* and her own parents didn't believe her. They thought she was just making it up, or taking things too personally. \n\nUntil, that is, her grade in that topic (taught by that bully of a teacher) suddenly dropped from an A to barely a C over the course of several report cards. Her parents finally believed what was happening and had words with the teacher, but damn. \n\nThat was just one thing in a long line of shitty things her parents did to make her understand the people who should've been protecting her were allowing her to be bullied.", "Seriously!!  For her to have a footprint on her dress, either someone kicked her or she was on the ground - neither really normal play!!", "Maybe because nobody supports her. \u2018She\u2019s always acted repulsed by kids\u2019 that could be a (super evident) sign of trauma that dad is ignoring while expecting her to be bruised to act", "You sound like the men who ask why women don't report SA and so does dad...", "It's only \"normal\" because asshole parents excuse the behavior as boys being boys. My sons sure don't act like that and better not or there will be serious consequences. My daughters male friends don't act like that either. She is equal bothered by the boys who do behave in obnoxious ways. And I don't mean rough housing and stuff but trying to impress friends by being jerks.", "You wonder why you don't have the evidence of your daughter being bullied. Or even feeling she is being mistreated by her male classmates. Now, wonder why your daughter did not feel she could come to you when all of this started at school?  It's because you ARE NOT a safe place for your daughter. That is what your behavior has taught her over the past 10 years.This conversation is not the issue. It is just the latest in a life where your daughter does not feel she can come to you. \n\nIf you continue on this path, your daughter will grow up feeling that every mean, shitty, or horrible thing that happens to her is her fault. She will believe that others can treat her however they want, and she doesn't have the autonomy to warrant respect. She will have such low self-esteem that she will allow herself to be mistreated. And that won't stop with glue in the hair or it's not being wiped on her, it'll move on to sexual assaults and abusive relationships. And she won't think that she deserves any better because she was taught at a young age that she must have done something to make them treat her this way.\n\nAnd I hope this is not what you're trying to teach your daughter, but it's obvious this is what she's taking from your lessons. Otherwise as I said she would have come to you sooner. And while you're sitting here trying to raise your daughter to check her biases, I think you need to check yours cuz you did not do this in this conversation. I hope for her sake you do better because I cried when I thought about what her future will be.

There are some real lessons he needs to learn here.", "Because boys will be boys probably. Maybe she asked for it by having sass or not smiling enough at the boys. Gotta teach her young to fall in line to the patriarchy", "Yup. She never said anything before because how her father reacted (blaming her,  assuming she did something first (code for \"asked for it\") and then expecting her to prove it in some way) is exactly how people act when this happens.", "And let's not forget the foot/shoe prints on her dress.. this poor girl.

Wtf.. op YTA", "Dad was probably a bully ..sounds like he still is.", "My guess is, yes. Because who else would think putting gum and glue in someone's hair is just \"being fun and friendly\".
