After this accident happened, my ex-husband was held on a psychiatric hold for the 4th time in the 5 years and the doctors in the hospital said it would be better if he is transferred to a permanent unit.

His family also wanted this.\n\nI still have a good relationship with my exIL's but we have moved to a different city so we don't see them as much as we used to(twice or thrice a year). When we go to their house, I sometimes go see my ex husband but he is not himself most of the time. He is diagnosed with DID and he has more than 12 different personalities. My oldest knows his dads condition and he visited his dad once but the other two doesn't remember that much. \n\nWe were with at exIL's place last month and at the 2nd day, my MIL tried to take them out. It wasn't surprising for me to see them going somewhere with their grandma but I still asked where they were going. I was waiting for \"To the mall\" or \"To a movie\" etc. but she said \"Oh, we are going to \"Hospital's Name.\" to visit \"exHusband\".\" I turned white really fast and FIL had to hold me.

You are the only functioning parent of these children and therefore only you are allowed to make decisions for them. Not your MIL, regardless of what her relationship with you or her grandkids is like. She cannot take the children to visit anyone without your permission.", "Your MIL was out of line to try and slip that one past you, that is something that should have been discussed privately with you, your youngest is 11.  I get, she was probably hopeful that it might help her son to see his children, but she did not think that one all the way through.  \n\nIt might be totally fine for your children to see their dad, but they should be prepared first by you.\n\nNTA", "NTA because you are trying to protect your kids, but honestly, I do think you should be telling them something age appropriate. The younger 2 know they have a father. What have you told them about why he\u2019s not around.\n\nYour MIL was completely out of line. Also, nobody gets divorced over one argument. The argument between your MIL and FIL may have been a last straw for her, but she\u2019s not looking for a divorce solely because he disagreed with her on this issue. You are not responsible for their divorce.", "Info: are your saying your youngest two don't know what's going on with him? When was the last time they saw him?", "He has DID? That\u2019s not something the kids could be adequately prepared for. He might not even recognize his own kids.\n\nNTA. Seeing him like this could be traumatic for your kids.", "Info:  Where do your children think their dad is?", "NTA.   \nShe shouldnt be doing things like that BEHIND your back.   \nThat should have been an open conversation.   \nThe fact that your FIL was none the wiser shows she knew it wouldn\u2019t be ok.   \n\n\nStay out of their divorce. There has probably been 40yrs of whatever nonsense this is, and it\u2019s between them. Support your FIL. Leave your MIL and FIL to battle it out without you.   \nShould your kids know their father? Sure! They are of an age where some contact could be wise, if it\u2019s supervised, if it\u2019s safe, if they want to\u2026 but that should be done in the open, not furtively. And it should be done after consultation with the psychiatrist so you can assess the risks to your children\u2019s health.   \n\n\n(Final side note: DID is rare, and the trauma to trigger it is usually far more profound than the lass your ex had. Almost certainly a number of other things (abuse?) went on that helped fracture his mind along the way, and it\u2019s entirely possible the DID existed prior to his brother\u2019s death. Normally the seeds for DID are planted in childhood as a result of abuse or ongoing and unmanaged trauma.  MIL sounds like she\u2019s ignoring trauma events, and hasn\u2019t learnt / isn\u2019t protecting your children and thus yes, you should be wary there.)", "NTA\n\nBut... are you lying to your younger kids at the moment with the plan to reveal the truth when they turn 18, as well as letting them know everyone else, including their brother, knew the truth all along?", "NTA\n\nI guess your MIL is still convinced that her little boy is in there somewhere, and wants her grandbabies to know him. That's understandable to me.\n\nBut he's not there anymore. He's a stranger to the kids, and ultimately, it is your decision whether they'll know him or not. She should respect that.", "NTA\n\nI have professionally diagnosed DID. I have 12 different personalities. I have never been a danger to others & I live independently (work full-time, live with my partner) but I know that this isn\u2019t the case with everyone with DID. Living with it can be hellish & nearly impossible to do so independently if there\u2019s a lot of alters. With that said, it IS possible to recover.\n\nPlease be aware that DID is only caused by early childhood trauma. So unless you know the specific trauma your ex endured as a child, it is very possible that one of his parents inflicted him with trauma. If you don\u2019t know what the trauma is, find out. You may want to reconsider a relationship with one or both of his parents. \n\nUltimately, you are the parent & you make the decisions for your children. You should be honest with them about their father\u2019s condition. It is very possible that through trauma therapy & medication, he can get his DID under control. I\u2019m living proof of that. It may be that in just a few years, he\u2019ll be able to live independently. DID can be managed & controlled. Please don\u2019t prevent your children from having a relationship with him just because he\u2019s ill.", "NTA, I think you are not asshole if you planned on telling your kids about their condition when the time was right.\n\nYour kids might react in a negative way seeing their father in a ward and realise their father is in a permanent unit....\n\nBut if you didn't plan on telling them then YTA, they have a right to know about their father at the right age.\n\nIt was also not okay for your MIL to take your kids without asking for your permission.", "NTA. It was very disrespectful of MIL to try to do this behind your back. You should be telling your children about their dad, and if THEY express an interest in seeing him, then you can plan how to make that happen. MIL doesn't get to pick the time and method of introducing the younger kids to their seriously ill father.\n\nDon't get caught in the middle if your ex-ILs are divorcing. The fact MIL didn't tell FIL about her plans demonstrates she knew what she was doing was underhanded.", "NTA!!! \nThat's so inappropriate", "I am gonna say your a soft AH. Your ex has serious mental issues that require permanent hospitalization and you keep 2 of the kids away. You should have had a talk with the kids long ago and been taking them to see thier dad. It is possible it might help him. As far as the MIL, she is a major AH for trying to sneak that by you. I would talk to your ex husband's doctors and get thier opinion on the kids visiting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
