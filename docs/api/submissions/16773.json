Almost certainly a number of other things (abuse?) went on that helped fracture his mind along the way, and it\u2019s entirely possible the DID existed prior to his brother\u2019s death. Normally the seeds for DID are planted in childhood as a result of abuse or ongoing and unmanaged trauma.

With that said, it IS possible to recover.\n\nPlease be aware that DID is only caused by early childhood trauma. So unless you know the specific trauma your ex endured as a child, it is very possible that one of his parents inflicted him with trauma. If you don\u2019t know what the trauma is, find out. You may want to reconsider a relationship with one or both of his parents. \n\nUltimately, you are the parent & you make the decisions for your children. You should be honest with them about their father\u2019s condition. It is very possible that through trauma therapy & medication, he can get his DID under control. I\u2019m living proof of that.

Treating it as if it's a psychotic disorder (high doses of antipsychotics, or encouraging the person to deny that the \"voices\" are real) is *ineffective and damaging,* and sadly, there are people who are treated that way for many years. \n\nAlters are not hallucinations--they are parts of his consciousness and need to be accepted, valued, and communicated with. Internal communication and cooperation are important goals. (I don't know how they're treating him right now, but it doesn't sound like what they're doing is helping him improve.)\n\nIn any case, I'm so sorry that you've had to deal with this. It sounds like you're doing the right thing to protect your children.", "I think 18 is too old. Speaking from personal experience they probably have a million questions they aren\u2019t asking. They need an age appropriate but honest explanation much sooner", "Excuse me but I do know what im talking about. My best friend is in a long term facility and shes told me about things shes witnessed: a patient who stabbed another patient, for example. Another who had to be detained because they were violently refusing their meds. I'm not judging the inmates but they CAN in a psychotic state act in ways they wouldn't ordinarily. And they have community rooms to do activities and see family in. If they have a psychotic break while there...stuff happens. I'm not comparing this to bedlam but you are talking about a longterm mental health facility, meaning people who can't be at home because they have severe mental health issues. This stuff DOES HAPPEN. Again, I'm not blaming them for their disorders but young children won't understand this.", "I don't think they were being derogatory. I understand you were trying to defend the patients but unfortunately that stuff does happen. It usually depends on the type of institution. Some are for patients that aren't as bad but some are really serious. My sister has worked in them for 15 years and while exposure wasn't a common experience for her, violent episodes and breakdowns really were in the higher security ones. It's not the patients fault of course but I agree that it would do more harm than good to take younger kids to one.", "Have you ? There's usually a reason someone's been put in inpatient care and it isn't because they're acting rationally. Where I am involuntary holds aren't even separate from self admits meaning people that are labeled an IMMINENT danger to themselves and/or others are with gen. pop. So yeah all of these happen. As someone below stated most psych facilities won't let kids under 16 visit anyway.", "When I was 18 I admitted myself to the local hospital for a voluntary psychiatric evaluation because of having certain thoughts about un-aliving myself. Most of the patients WERE very nice, some had been admitted by family and some had come willingly like me for certain issues. But I do remember one incident that shook me up, I was talking to an older guy who was very excitedly showing me his leather bound bible he got from an actual priest, when we heard screaming and watched hospital personnel have to drag a young man in. He was screaming, swearing, threatening to kill them. The rooms all had windows on them so you could see inside when the door was closed and we could see that unlike the rest of the room, this one had no bed / bed frame in it, just a cot on the floor. They ended up giving him some kind of needle and he calmed right down after that.\n\nThe incident did freak me out a bit because up until then everyone had been calm and nice, even the nurses and I felt very safe there due to not needing to constantly fight my mental illness there since other people were monitoring it for me. This was a small unit that allowed signed in visitors to come inside and the ward door was locked so we had to sign if we wanted an outing.\n\nI can easily see how something like that could be terrifying to a young child. Mentally ill people aren\u2019t scary by default, but their symptoms CAN be especially if someone brings you in unprepared like it sounds like MIL planned to do.\n\nNTA.", "I've transported psych patients before. In the exposing themselves category it probably wouldn't even be malicious as much as just not understanding anything is wrong. I had a patient jump off my gurney and run just hanging it all out there and didn't care.", "Right? It can be just a normal good ole day, or someone decides to strip ass naked screaming they're a bird and try to perch on another patients shoulder. Shit happens. It's not a place for kids to be and find out though.", "Thank you. This person is acting like I'm talking about 19th century Bedlam, or 1950s era psych facility where they're given ECT. A long term treatment facility will have patients with severe mental health issues and they CAN act inappropriately. I don't blame them for something they can't control but children wouldn't understand and could get frightened", "And did visitations happen on higher care levels?? No, visitation is done in special areas or supervised communal areas where that does not happen. Yes.", "I have been to a locked ward to visit family and it was terrifying as a child.", "Agreed. My best friend is in a long term facility and I can't bring my 10 year old daughter there, who she views my friend as an aunt. This person obviously has no knowledge of these facilities. I'm sure they were just defending the patients but i meant no insult to them. Psychotic breaks are heartbreaking and I feel nothing but compassion for them... but I wouldn't subject my daughter to them either", "As a teenager working in a hospital (delivering mail, flowers, etc), I was surprised by a very nude patient.  He saw my look of fear and immediately wrapped an arm around me, tucked me close to his side, and said \"don't worry little girl, we'll find your parents.\" Then he basically dragged me to the nurse's station to very politely ask them for help with a lost child.  He then confirmed twice that I felt safe being left with the nurses as one of them looked very upset at my predicament. He tried to be reassuring and said he was happy to wait with me until my parents came if I was scared of the \"grumpy lady.\" Then he patted my hand and wandered off until a burly guy in scrubs gently led him back towards his room.\n\nHe had no bad intentions.  He was just on some medicine for pain relief that made him *very* loopy.  Like... A LOT of ketamine, among other things.", "Yeah there's totally a range in the flashing off - like just doesnt know its wrong/why its just not something you do in public and the one that totally knows and will do it just because... Honestly ive heard more of the first one type happening, as the second one was more \"controlled\"", "For me everyone was fine and then, for example, someone would scream about whatever and then once one single patient gets agitated, (sometimes) suddenly everyone is and thats when chaos ensues. Also its not even for all adults - some are really sensitive or just find all the shenigans that happen in the ward noisy and loud or anything else and don't wanna be there.      \n\n\nSo my point - if even some adults don't wanna be in there, why would children should be let in (and im talking about medical personal and visits)", "They still use ECT, just with sedation.

It's also a very funny show that everyone should catch.", "I have been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. I am on a medication for miles and therapy weekly if not bi weekly.

My sibling stepped in to help by becoming a nanny. \n\nHis mother would do genuine damage to him to suddenly \u201cintroduce\u201d 3 real life people who he\u2019s told are his kids. He will freak. Imagine being told the kids you remember grew so much that they are strangers without any intervention between. I personally think that would set him back years. \n\nI am all for the reintroduction eventually.  Just not now for dad\u2019s sake.  The kids can\u2019t witness another meltdown and he will come back and be reminded that that\u2019s the father they remember. Not good. Not good at all. \n\nNta. This is a hill to die on for EVERYONE\u2019s sake.", "Nta oof, your poor husband. Your poor kids! Poor you!!  This just is a sucky situation for everyone. \n\nWhat good would it do for the kids to see their dad like he is now?  He pretty much isn't their dad anymore.\n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. :(", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMIL broke your trust - don't let her have unsupervised time with your kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMIL and FIL's divorce does not concern you - but let FIL Stax in contact with his grandkids.

You cannot predict what will happen, there\u2019s no reason to believe it will be helpful for their father and it runs an *exceptionally* high risk of doing serious emotional damage to them. \n  \n  Do not subject your children to this unless absolutely necessary. \n  \n  When they are 18 you can coach and support them before they visit, preferably with professional help, if they *choose* to do that.\n  \n  NTA.", "I was in a psychiatric hospital for over a month due to suicide attempts. There were absolutely patients there that had violent outburst!! Even an orderly got his nose broken because of hallucinations that the patient was attempting to physically fight to get away from. There was a guy who planted a bomb in his high school. A girl who stabbed her mother. Legit stalker who beat up the girl he was stalking. And this was all in the kids ward. They are not safe by any means. They do the best that they can, and I did get the help I needed which gave me an incredible future. But ... the real reason I worked so hard to get better is because being in the hospital was the most scared I have ever been. I live in the ghetto and had an abusive father, and the hospital was way more dangerous than anything I had experienced before. \n\nIt has nothing to do with viewing mental illness as being criminal, it's about the fact that there are violent people there who are also affected with mental illness. I believe in therapy and meditation wholeheartedly, but we can't ignore truths because it sounds like \"judgment\"", "As it\u2019s a permanent facility, the people held there are likely severely mentally ill. Mentally illness is a spectrum, with varying degrees of severity. People who require permanent institutionalization are those whose conditions interfere with their ability to safely reside in the community, as in a threat to the safety of others. They\u2019re often over-sedated or require physical intervention to contain their outbursts, because, further, these wards are not always a comfortable or pleasant place to be. Those physical interventions are not pretty. They are violent, sad, and traumatizing to experience, participate in, and witness. \n\nMental illness is not a character deficit, but the symptoms are real, and that includes impulsive, violent, or aggressive behaviors.\n\nEdited: typos", "I\u2019m wondering if he has a dual diagnosis. DID *and* a psychotic disorder. \n\nIf he has a genetic predisposition towards psychotic disorders, the trauma and brain damage would make that much worse. The DID could\u2019ve even emerged to *help* with delusions or hallucinations.", "Same, I didn't see anyone expose themselves ever. But I did witness a few violent incidents while I was there. Luckily, besides one incident with an orderly's nose getting broken during an episode, no one was hurt worse than a few bumps and bruises. However, I will remember how scary it was to be there for the rest of my life. Perhaps if they met their father outside on the hospital grounds would be a decent choice, but I don't think kids should be exposed to that yet either", "I get, she was probably hopeful that it might help her son to see his children, but she did not think that one all the way through.", "This should go straight to the top \ud83c\udf1f", "It's not like most hospitals just tell visitors \"good luck, enjoy\" and let them wander the halls, they usually have set spaces for visits that are heavily monitored. I've been hospitalized and have friends who have done or are in long-term facilities and visits are controlled for patient and visitor safety. I completely agree that it could be heartbreaking for a child (or anyone) to see someone struggling with an extreme illness, but please remember that the patients are struggling with a severe illness and not just crazy people saying and doing \"strange things\". If children are allowed to visit, even a semi-decent facility will do everything in their power to keep them safe.\n\nI agree that MIL is absolutely in the wrong here as it is not her decision to make, and OP is valid in her concern about the children's well-being. Only she should be able to make decisions regarding their visits to see their father. However, I honestly feel like your comment dehumanizes those requiring long-term care for mental illnesses and does not accurately reflect the experience of people visiting these types of facilities. Each facility is different and each patient is different. Some may be safer than others, even long-term or permanent care facilities.", "One of my friends works at an in-patient psychiatric facility.  He's very cool with most of the dudes there.  One  day (for no reason/trigger he knew of), one of the guys used a plastic spoon to castrate one of his own testicles.  Obviously, this kind of behavior is not the norm, but it *does* happen.", "It does happen, but not in every long-term care facility. A close friend is in a care facility specifically for people who are not able to live without additional support from doctors/nurses but still hold full-time jobs. I understand this does not seem to match the facility OP is discussing, but not every facility is the same.", "I mean, of course that's possible. The brain damage was from the car accident 6 years ago? Or the bus accident when he was 5? If it was from 6 years ago, that could certainly be complicating the picture. \n\nBut the fact that he was functioning normally before the loss of his brother speaks against the presence of a psychotic disorder, since it would be very unusual for that to start in someone's late 30s. \n\nA person can (and often does) have psychotic symptoms with DID, but that doesn't mean there's a psychotic disorder present. \n\nThere can be alters who have faulty reality testing because they are still in trauma time, and that can seem like delusional thinking. Under a lot of stress, someone with DID can be out of touch with reality, but when things are stable again, those symptoms abate.\n\nHowever, he has had so much additional trauma, with the accident and the loss of his marriage and family life, and being in the hospital, that it has likely overwhelmed his coping abilities. \n\nIt sounds very complicated, and unusual, even for DID. I have DID (although not much amnesia, fortunately)--you would never know, and I didn't even know until my mid-50s. I look very successful--marriage, children, professional career (although part-time). If you look closer, though, I'm estranged from my family, and I can be very \"moody.\" Covert systems like mine are the most common. And I assume that's kind of how your husband was before he lost his brother?\n\nAnyway, these are just some thoughts, and obviously I'm just a random person on the internet. I do hope it's possible for some things to improve for your husband, and even for your children to have some kind of relationship with him again, if he improves to the point where it seems to be in their best interest."]}
