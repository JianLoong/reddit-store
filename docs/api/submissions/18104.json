Non profit, I catch all cats and get them the medical attention they need myself, out of my own pocket. I love helping them. A lot of the cats are not able to be rehomed, so I fix them and release them. Get them their shots and hope for the best. I am not a large scale operation.\n\nRecently I was called to an area overrun with orange cats. They were everywhere and I mostly ended up handing it over to professionals.\n\nI did, however, manage to grab three very sweet cats. Two were terrified, skinny, a little beaten up, but overrall friendly. The third one was a little gent. \n\nHe was tubby, well groomed, fish patterned collar, the works. My plan was to find his parents and drop him off with a warning to keep him in due to the large amount of traps being set. Then the little bastard sprayed the inside of my car to the freakin max.\n\nSo, apparently, he wasn't fixed. I couldn't really tell (longhair) and assumed he was so left my covers off. Big mistake!\n\nI debated taking him home or taking him to get neutered with the rest. He was an indoor-outdoor cat (indicated by his collar tag) and with so many strays I'm certain some were carrying his genetics.\n\nUltimately I took him with me and got him neutered. No chip so I called the number on his tag and informed them where their cat was and gave them time slots to pick him up or have him dropped off.\n\nThe owners went ballistic. They were cursing me out and came to collect their cat not twenty minutes later. Called me a kidnapper, blamed me for their child having nightmares (scared over their cat going missing).\n\nI tried to explain that he needed to be fixed if he was going to be outside but they didn't want to know. They said I should have called immediately regardless.\n\nI spoke to my rescue friend who said I was in the wrong. Even though we know we are technically in the right, we didn't have the legal ground to do that and it wasn't my decision to make. \n\nI did apologise, but have blocked their numbers (the mom is flaming me on facebook and dm'ing people I know). I have a duty to care for stray cats. Me knowing an unneutered male was roaming free and not doing anything about it was a concern for said stray cats.\n\nThings are still tense between my rescue buddy and I and I don't completely disagree. I know I crossed a line even if it was for the greater good. People are finding out and taking sides, so I'm not sure who to really believe was \"right\" here.\n\nSo...

It doesn't matter if you agree with him being unaltered or not. Get off your moral high horse and stop stealing people's frickin' cats.\n\nI hope that the vet gets reported and that you face legal punishment. Neither one of you took the steps to contact a very contactable owner. You both knew what you were doing.", "YTA and a monster. It wasn\u2019t you\u2019re cat, it\u2019s not your choice to force your opinions onto it.", "INFO:\n\n\\- How long was it between trapping the cat and taking it to the vet, since the owners had time to notice he was missing?\n\n\\- Why did you not call the number on the tag BEFORE making an irreversible decision about someone else's pet?", "YTA! You called the owners fine after the desex you should have done it before. Your own fault if the owners sue you!", "YTA, it's paternalistic for you to do what's \"best\" for a family's pet cat without the consent of its owners. The cat was not in any life-threatening danger. You could just as easily have called the family and let them know while returning the cat, \"Hey, I work in animal rescue and we recommend neutering outdoor cats so that there are less homeless kittens. We offer this service, would you be interested?\" Instead, you chose to avoid the difficult conversation and argue that the ends justify the means.", "YTA it doesn't matter what you think, it wasn't your place and you did a medical procedure out of hate. You should tell us where you work, I bet you abuse animals too.", "Why are you asking this question? It seems like you know that YTA, but you don't care. You want people to tell you that you were justified, but you were in the wrong.", "YTA. You did kidnap their cat and made a (superbly arrogant) decision to have him neutered without the owners permission. You can judge them all you want for letting their cat outside, but the first thing to have done was to call the cat's people and asked \"Hey, I found your cat. Did you know he was outside?\" That's the basic due diligence, right there.(translated: what decent people who are not assholes regularly do.) How a vet decided to neuter the cat means you must have taken off the collar and obscured the owner's information, or they would not have done it without their permission. You just made yourself hella actionable, legally. You don't know if they were planning to breed the cat and he just happened to get out.", "YTA.  I agree that animals should be fixed, especially if they are allowed to roam freely outside, however it is never OK to make a medical decision for someone else or their pet!  If they want to be irresponsible pet owners, that\u2019s on them.  What if this cat had an emergency during surgery and something horrible happened?  That would be all on you.", "YTA. You knew how to get ahold of the owners from the first moment you grabbed the cat. You kidnapped him and had irreversible surgery done on him. \n\nYes, I know the owners were irresponsible about letting their intact cat out, but you could have educated them when you contacted them about their cat you picked up. But there is no law against what they did. Against what you did, yes. \n\nYou risked your entire TNR program over this.", "YTA, though the owners are a little wrong  for letting their cat roam outdoors, especially not neutered. \n\nYou\u2019re a way bigger, absolutely fucking massive asshole for knowingly taking someone\u2019s pet and forcing a surgical procedure on it, no matter how common the procedure is. You are 100% in the wrong here.", "As much as I support what you do, and would have at least been tempted to do if I was in your shoes, YTA.  Unfortunately you can't force anyone to do the right thing and keep pets responsibly.  \n\nI'd recommend giving their information to your local SPCA, though.  If they admit to allowing their intact male outdoors to breed (which is likely based on most of the local cats looking suspiciously like him) the SPCA might be able to hold them accountable for any costs or issues arising from their cat and his progeny.  Doubtful, but it's worth a shot.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer in the catch, fix, release for feral cat populations where homing isn\u2019t an option.  \n\nI\u2019m also a firm believer in that cats do not need to free roam to be happy, should NOT be let outside to do as they please, and they\u2019re healthier and safer as indoor only.  \n\nBut you did the bare minimum to nothing to get an obviously owned cat back to its owner before you had him neutered.  \n\nYTA", "YTA I hope you get sued and the family gets money from you as they should", "> I know I crossed a line\n\nNo matter how you _feel_ about un-neutered outdoor cats, you _know_ doing this to a non-stray is wrong.\n\nYTA and you already know it.

Yes I agree cats should be neutered , but even small surgeries have their risks and I'd love to know what you would have told that family if the cat had come out with issues or worse, died during it. \n\n\"Hey I got your cat fixed without asking first and something went wrong so I am calling to let you know he passed\" ? \n\nIs it likely to happen? No. But its a possibility that you didn't even take into consideration and that's a huge asshole move. Also keeping the cat for an entire day without calling them to let them know its okay, not cool.", "NTA, if the cat is on the prowl the owners should be responsible enough to neuter it.

You didn't trap the cat and call the number. No, you took it to the vet, got it neutered, and then called the owners. Why? Because you knew there was a likelihood the owners wouldn't want it neutered. From your one comment sounds like you have done similar things before -- YTA. You could have called animal control, SPCA, whoever else to deal with this cat who wasn't a stray. But you didn't.", "Oh yes YTA\n\nFor all you knew, the cat had gotten out in error and was actually a papered cat, whom the owners used for breeding purposes.\n\nYou had absolutely NO right to have the cat neutered without permission of the owners.", "YTA. While I completely agree with neutering your pets and TNR programs, you could have gone through with this in a more productive way. \n\nFirst, you 100% should have informed the owners as soon as you caught the cat. It had a collar and you clearly identified that it was a pet. It\u2019s fair for them to be upset that you took their cat and did not alert them about it. \n\nAlso, you could have talked to them and told them about the benefits of doing TNR programs. You could have offered to pay for the procedure (which it sounds like you paid for it anyways). Education is key in these situations. They might not have even known that the cat is not neutered, given most cat owners do not take them to the vet. \n\nWhile I know you thought you were doing the right thing, it should have been done in a more productive manner. Also, they technically could sue you for property damage depending on where you live. At least where I am from, pets are property under the law so they would have a case for property damage.", "YTA\n\nIt had a collar, you knew it wasn\u2019t a stray.

And now you\u2019re mad they\u2019re not so very happy at your wonderful actions of neutering cats.\n\nIt was their cat, not yours. Not your cat to make decisions about. Many people own outdoor cats, not every outdoor cat is a stray. Yet you choose to take someone\u2019s cat and act self righteous.", "Like your not right but personally I think NTA. I agree with what you did. Pets shouldn\u2019t be outdoor animals and he was creating more cats and adding to the problem. They were irresponsible. You corrected an issue", "YTA \nIt is a medical procedure. You had no right to make that call. What if there was some crazy complication?

You can\u2019t make decisions about other people Pets", "Nta bc op says this Tom is out making kittens, meaning he didn't escape one day by accident.

Not your call to make - even if it is the right one.", "YTA as he was obviously owned and had a collar with the owners number.  You should have called them first.", " NTA. They are irresponsible pet owners and are endangering the community by having an unneutered male cat about. It\u2019s unethical and should be illegal.", "YTA\n\nIt was not a stray under the TNR definition and you should have contacted the owner before anything was done to the animal.

This is a perfect example. Now your organization has lost credibility and will receive less financial and community support because people will worry if their pets are next.\n\nPeople who believe animals should be sterilized under all circumstances even prevent animals from going g to homes if the potential adopter has ever owned an intact animal, even if they were pure breed show dogs. You do not always know best. You should have stayed in your lane.", "YTA. The cat does not belong to you. That\u2019s not your call to make regardless of what you think is the greater good.

Neutering is still surgery, with no knowledge of medical history. What if the cat had died from a bad reaction to anesthesia? Given that pets are generally considered property from a legal perspective, you could also be considered guilty of theft. Not your cat, not your decision.", "YTA\n\nYou had no idea if that cat has other health issues, you just took it upon yourself to make a medical decision FOR A CAT THAT WASN'T YOURS. I'd be calling you every name under the sun if you did that to one of my cats. \n\nI understand the whole not wanting more kittens to be born unnecessarily and trying to protect feral cat colonies but c'mon.

My friends TNR as well, but the rules are if you catch a cat with a collar or microchip, you have to either let the cat go or try to return them to the owner.  You are NOT to TNR someone's pet.  I fully agree that outdoor cats should not be a thing and that you should neuter your animals, but you can not make that choice for others.  The fact that the TNR vet still did it when the cat had a collar is baffling.  Both you and the vet are very likely to get in serious trouble if the owners decide to push for criminal charges.

We warned the group several times, and even offered to provide then with a scanning wand for microchips.  Well, it happened.  They chose not to listen and scooped up several owned cats.  No collar, microchipped. Domestic pets are property, and they got sued, and we are no longer associated with them if they are even still operating.  We heard from our county ACO that they were trespassed from several locations.\n\nYTA not only for taking and having a surgical procedure on someone\u2019s legal property, but you KNEW you were wrong.", "INFO: What reputable veterinarian performs non-emergent surgical operations on homed animals with virtually no notice and without permission from the owners?", "YTA, as much as it sucks letting an intact tom go back into the wild, you wildly overstepped.\n\n I've done a lot of  TNR over the years, I speak to you as a fellow rescuer.\n\nWe both know that \"never TNR an owned cat\" is a core philosophy of TNR programs.  In no small part, this is because doing so really harms public opinion of TNR programs and raises distrust that we are \"stealing pets\".\n\nYou know you always have to try to contact from any IDs first, be that microchip or collar and tag.

I am totally on board with neutering outdoor cats. \n\nBut this cat clearly had an owner that was quick to respond to a call. You ignored that and put their cat through an anesthetic  procedure.

Period.", "YTA massively so. You had no right to make a medical decision for someone else's cat. They cat could've had a medical condition that made anesthesia lethal to them. Cats metabolism slows down when neutered, again you don't know the medical history. The owners might also just be scared due to trauma of such a procedure having gone wrong and that's why they didn't do it. Again  YOU HAVE NO IDEA. The owners picked the cat up within 20min, so they probably try to be mindful of their cat and this could've been the one time he got away. It's like taking someones child and putting a tattoo or something on them. A permanent decision THAT WASN'T YOURS TO MAKE.

Outdoor cats spread disease, lead to more strays (if not fixed), fuck with bird populations, and are in far more danger than getting neutered (thus outdoor cats having an average lifespan **HALF AS LONG** as indoor cats.) What you\u2019ve done did nothing but benefit that cat, other cats, and the shitty owners. What others might have done is declaw it, shoot it, or run it over.

Non profit, I catch all cats and get them the medical attention they need myself, out of my own pocket. I love helping them. A lot of the cats are not able to be rehomed, so I fix them and release them. Get them their shots and hope for the best. I am not a large scale operation.\n\nRecently I was called to an area overrun with orange cats. They were everywhere and I mostly ended up handing it over to professionals.\n\nI did, however, manage to grab three very sweet cats. Two were terrified, skinny, a little beaten up, but overrall friendly. The third one was a little gent. \n\nHe was tubby, well groomed, fish patterned collar, the works. My plan was to find his parents and drop him off with a warning to keep him in due to the large amount of traps being set. Then the little bastard sprayed the inside of my car to the freakin max.\n\nSo, apparently, he wasn't fixed. I couldn't really tell (longhair) and assumed he was so left my covers off. Big mistake!\n\nI debated taking him home or taking him to get neutered with the rest. He was an indoor-outdoor cat (indicated by his collar tag) and with so many strays I'm certain some were carrying his genetics.\n\nUltimately I took him with me and got him neutered. No chip so I called the number on his tag and informed them where their cat was and gave them time slots to pick him up or have him dropped off.\n\nThe owners went ballistic. They were cursing me out and came to collect their cat not twenty minutes later. Called me a kidnapper, blamed me for their child having nightmares (scared over their cat going missing).\n\nI tried to explain that he needed to be fixed if he was going to be outside but they didn't want to know. They said I should have called immediately regardless.\n\nI spoke to my rescue friend who said I was in the wrong. Even though we know we are technically in the right, we didn't have the legal ground to do that and it wasn't my decision to make. \n\nI did apologise, but have blocked their numbers (the mom is flaming me on facebook and dm'ing people I know). I have a duty to care for stray cats. Me knowing an unneutered male was roaming free and not doing anything about it was a concern for said stray cats.\n\nThings are still tense between my rescue buddy and I and I don't completely disagree. I know I crossed a line even if it was for the greater good. People are finding out and taking sides, so I'm not sure who to really believe was \"right\" here.\n\nSo...

But I guess its a different area lol.", "I\u2019m sure the owners have already contacted the vet and threatened to do so, and perhaps the police as well.", "The husband made comments about the cat \"no longer being a man\" so I'm not sure they would have neutered nor would they have kept the cat indoors.", "Then the owners can keep their frickin unfixed cat in the flippin house where it belongs.", "Absolutely correct. They could have kept the cat in the house. If it's out on public property then too bad.", "\"Sorry not sorry\" sums it up nicely. I don't understand why OP is on AITA. OP seems to have the same attitude as you: Sorry, not sorry.", "What about all of the tens, even hundreds of kittens an intact tomcat might produce that have a high likelihood of suffering and/or dying because shelters are already packed full? What about all of the female strays who might die due to birth complications? What about all of the fights that hormonal, territorial tomcat might get into, leaving himself and other cats with wounds that could very easily get infected?\n\nNeutering is an extremely safe procedure, especially when compared to the risk that being outside at all poses to a cat as well as any other cats it might come into contact with. If you cared about cats, you'd understand that.", "She explained clearly that it was just her", "Eh. I call it a program because it sounds all official like, but its not an actual program.", "Lol getting this upset about a cat that had a family that was not adequately taking care of it. Male unneutered cats wander far, get in frequent fights, likely to catch transferable illnesses, and lead to gross overpopulation. And your this upset because cat was neutered? Strange", "So what. If they cannot take care of their cat adequately- that\u2019s on them", "No, I know. Thats why I'm saying I'm \"all for\" it, as in, I want it to be a law. I would love for it to exist & neutering to become cheaper. But I don't think that will happen.", "I tend to help out in impoverished areas. People seem to be a lot more grateful. Maybe I'll skip the \"nice\" neighbourhood next time. Christ.", "I was trying to bait the other cats. Tbh I was quite annoyed because he was scaring the little ones off.", "Its not guaranteed we'll catch all of the females, and we do prioritise males over females. Their surgeries are less invasive, quicker to heal from, and one male cat will produce more kittens than one female cat.", ">I would say that there are damages\n\nUnless there's evidence that the owner was planning on breeding the cat I don't see and monetary damages here.", ">Stealing someone\u2019s property, scaring their kid into thinking their cat was lost\n\nActual *damages*.  As in: **prove** that you're out actual dollars.  The legal system really doesn't care about feelings.", "While I am not a lawyer I do work in the animal healthcare industry and have seen cases like this before. I am very familiar with the laws in my state. Therefore, I feel like what I stated is appropriate for this case. However, I explicitly stated that it is strictly where I reside and that I am not a lawyer. Therefore I am speaking from my own experience and not a legal standpoint. I\u2019m only providing my opinion on a previous comment about being interested in seeing it play out in a legal battle. I was not offering \u201cquasi legal advice\u201d as you put it, but rather my own knowledge with the law.", "Regardless of truth, that\u2019s their owners\u2019 decision to make.", "IMO anyone who has an unaltered, outdoor cat is an irresponsible owner, who probably shouldn\u2019t have cat. The owner is lucky it didn\u2019t get trapped and taken to animal control. They would have had to pay a fine on top of the cost of getting the cat altered.\n\nIt disgusting to contribute to the ridiculous overpopulation problem. Who know how many litters that cat has sired. Of course, the owner doesn\u2019t care because their cat isn\u2019t the one getting pregnant.", "It\u2019s a lot more disgusting to allow an unaltered cat to freely roam and procreate. It\u2019s unhealthy for them, for the environment, and likely deadly to their feral offspring. Responsible pet owners have neutered/spayed animals. End of story.", "If you owned an unfixed cat that you let roam the neighbourhood, then you\u2019d be a bad person. \n\nThe lazy ass owners should be thanking her for getting their cat neutered for free, and they didn\u2019t even have to book an appointment or take time off work to drop off or pick up at the vet\u2019s.", "Typically specialty breeds are chipped. They're also very easy to tell apart from your typical domestic.", "This cat's collar had an *accurate and functioning phone number* on it.  This was very, very clearly not a neighborhood cat that a few people feed.", "There is no lol in this whole situation, I hope they follow up on this as you obviously haven't learned anything.", "Ha! I said that up above before reading this. That if anything, the owners should appreciate the free surgery. And it sounds like most of them do. Because most reasonable people want that for their pets, even if some can\u2019t afford it.", "If they don't bother to neuter their cat or keep him indoors, then I doubt they are organized enough to think of this. They sound like spoiled lazy people. Technically OP was in the wrong but fuck that, I think OP made the right call. I'd rather have idiots annoyed with me than dozens more strays to suffer and die. NTA.", "That is tragic. The reality is you put the entire program at risk. These people are likely to continue to make a fuss and paint your group as extremists who are kidnapping owned animals and putting them at risk. They can claim that it is happening because that is what you did. Cat's die during surgery sometimes. It's rare but it happens. They have complications. It wasn't your call. You should lobby for the requirement for outdoor animals to be neutered. Instead you have likely put the TNR group at risk of being disallowed.", "It\u2019s. Not. Your. Cat. \n\nIf they want him outside and not neutered, fine. They own the cat.", "That doesn\u2019t make your actions right either. Is their behavior AH ish? Possibly we don\u2019t know because we only have your story AND you are the one who posted. Your behavior was seriously AH", "Which is their choice.", "Exactly\nWe don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, they can\u2019t just do whatever the hell they want when it affects other cats and people \nThey should\u2019ve kept him indoors", "There are single people who run TNR  programs and do have a nonprofit status. Again, there is a level of due diligence to contact the owner first. This is someone's loved pet, whether it goes outside or not doesn't mean it's less loved, it is just a different philosophy than some people have. I agree that fertile pets should not be left to roam, however, they say they didn't even know whether or not it was intact and took it anyway, without a basic check in. A cared-for pet, you should be giving the owners at least the benefit of the doubt that they are unaware of the situation and make every attempt to contact them first. That's what decent people who care about others do. It's not helping the world if you lack empathy for those who might be ignorant of their cat's condition.", "Holy shit no way this is real. No way. YTA and uh. Look forward to court I guess?", "yta hope you learned your lesson when u get sued especially after your comments here.", "Cat could have died if it had a issue with the entire procedure.", "The cat could have had a reaction to the anesthesia or pre-meds and become seriously ill or died. The owners also have the legal grounds to sue OP, which results in one less person willing and able to help stray cats when we already don't have many volunteers. It obviously sucks that the owners didn't take proper care of their cat, but we cannot take matters into our own hands. \n\n(I am another TNR volunteer and also foster kittens)", "You are being willfully obtuse. It is not your place of authority to do what you are doing. Especially to collared animals. In fact, it is destruction of property. You may think you have the authority to do so because its a noble act, its not.", "Yes please do skip that neighborhood and do everyone a favor and skip them all. You\u2019re out of control!", "Really should not feel the need to excuse your actions. Obviously these people like to remain ignorant of the overpopulation problem and prefer to be outraged. If that family took proper care, the cat would not have been able to be trapped.", "So you contact the owners and say \"hey, I'm trying to do a TNR here to help the local cats, and your cat is scaring them off because he's human friendly. Could you please keep him inside for a while?\" Again, the thoughtful solution to the problem.", "Who\u2019s this we? You just kidnap cats", "Don\u2019t people sue for emotional distress all the time though?", "We don't know if the cat was an outdoor cat or if it just happened to escape. Either way OP doesn't get to make the decisions about someone else's pet.", "And when they get the entire organization shut down and perhaps have this vet sanctioned, then what? What great good can they continue to do now? It was reckless and irresponsible when you think of the big picture", "They don\u2019t even have a program! They said in another comment they just use the word, there\u2019s no group or program or any non profit. It\u2019s just them on their own, which is honestly even worse.  There are tnr groups, which follow rules about owned cats, that they can volunteer with and work for but they just went off on their own.", "Then they should have kept their property in their house.", "It's a stupid choice and is indicative of asshole behavior. OP's behavior was a little bit Chaotic Neutral and I'm okay with that.", "You mean like\u2026. Let\u2019s say\u2026. Kidnapping someone\u2019s pet and getting it fixed?\n\nYou\u2019re right, people can\u2019t do whatever the hell they want when it affects other cats and people.", ">Holy shit no way this is real. No way. \n\nI have the same feeling after I'd thought about it a while.", "Thank you.", "She didn\u2019t snatch it from its own fenced in yard- the cat was roaming the neighborhood unattended. The owners are lucky the cat was simply neutered and returned to them. The owners child would really be having nightmares if they saw the cats mangled body after it was run over by a car, mauled by another animal, or poisoned by a disgruntled neighbor. Hopefully this experience prompts them to become more responsible pet owners, but I doubt it.", "OP said the tag indicated the cat is indoor/outdoor.\n\nCats left to roam outdoors are frequently injured and killed. If you let your animals roam unsupervised outside you give up control over what happens to them. What OP did is statistically improve that cats chances at surviving long-term, and also ensured that the cat isn\u2019t going to further contribute to the out of control feral population, causing further destruction to wildlife and more dead cats.", "Yikes", "It could have escaped, they could have taken every measure to secure it. Fact remains, It. Wasn\u2019t. Your. Cat.", "You can't kidnap a cat in a public street where it shouldn't be.", "She did the responsible and right thing \nHer cat was loose and making more cats- and the owners didn\u2019t care how it affected the community \nThey\u2019re the ones who think they\u2019re in a vacuum and who think their cats actions have no consequences", "I would have done exactly the same! And frankly after seeing all those poor hungry young kittens in his image- I would not have returned the cat. Outdoor cats have short life spans, the odds are against them.", "Here you can't let your animals roam. They have to be leashed. However you still can't have someone else's pet spayed or neutered. It's theft and property damage."]}
