{"id": 18104, "submission_id": "13r1k0r", "title": "AITA For neutering a cat that was clearly owned?", "selftext": "I run a TNR program for feral cats. Non profit, I catch all cats and get them the medical attention they need myself, out of my own pocket. I love helping them. A lot of the cats are not able to be rehomed, so I fix them and release them. Get them their shots and hope for the best. I am not a large scale operation.\n\nRecently I was called to an area overrun with orange cats. They were everywhere and I mostly ended up handing it over to professionals.\n\nI did, however, manage to grab three very sweet cats. Two were terrified, skinny, a little beaten up, but overrall friendly. The third one was a little gent. \n\nHe was tubby, well groomed, fish patterned collar, the works. My plan was to find his parents and drop him off with a warning to keep him in due to the large amount of traps being set. Then the little bastard sprayed the inside of my car to the freakin max.\n\nSo, apparently, he wasn't fixed. I couldn't really tell (longhair) and assumed he was so left my covers off. Big mistake!\n\nI debated taking him home or taking him to get neutered with the rest. He was an indoor-outdoor cat (indicated by his collar tag) and with so many strays I'm certain some were carrying his genetics.\n\nUltimately I took him with me and got him neutered. No chip so I called the number on his tag and informed them where their cat was and gave them time slots to pick him up or have him dropped off.\n\nThe owners went ballistic. They were cursing me out and came to collect their cat not twenty minutes later. Called me a kidnapper, blamed me for their child having nightmares (scared over their cat going missing).\n\nI tried to explain that he needed to be fixed if he was going to be outside but they didn't want to know. They said I should have called immediately regardless.\n\nI spoke to my rescue friend who said I was in the wrong. Even though we know we are technically in the right, we didn't have the legal ground to do that and it wasn't my decision to make. \n\nI did apologise, but have blocked their numbers (the mom is flaming me on facebook and dm'ing people I know). I have a duty to care for stray cats. Me knowing an unneutered male was roaming free and not doing anything about it was a concern for said stray cats.\n\nThings are still tense between my rescue buddy and I and I don't completely disagree. I know I crossed a line even if it was for the greater good. People are finding out and taking sides, so I'm not sure who to really believe was \"right\" here.\n\nSo...

You called the owners fine after the desex you should have done it before. Your own fault if the owners sue you!", "YTA, it's paternalistic for you to do what's \"best\" for a family's pet cat without the consent of its owners. The cat was not in any life-threatening danger. You could just as easily have called the family and let them know while returning the cat, \"Hey, I work in animal rescue and we recommend neutering outdoor cats so that there are less homeless kittens. We offer this service, would you be interested?\" Instead, you chose to avoid the difficult conversation and argue that the ends justify the means.", "YTA it doesn't matter what you think, it wasn't your place and you did a medical procedure out of hate. You should tell us where you work, I bet you abuse animals too.", "Why are you asking this question? It seems like you know that YTA, but you don't care. You want people to tell you that you were justified, but you were in the wrong.", "YTA. You did kidnap their cat and made a (superbly arrogant) decision to have him neutered without the owners permission. You can judge them all you want for letting their cat outside, but the first thing to have done was to call the cat's people and asked \"Hey, I found your cat. Did you know he was outside?\" That's the basic due diligence, right there.(translated: what decent people who are not assholes regularly do.) How a vet decided to neuter the cat means you must have taken off the collar and obscured the owner's information, or they would not have done it without their permission. You just made yourself hella actionable, legally. You don't know if they were planning to breed the cat and he just happened to get out.", "YTA.  I agree that animals should be fixed, especially if they are allowed to roam freely outside, however it is never OK to make a medical decision for someone else or their pet!

You knew how to get ahold of the owners from the first moment you grabbed the cat. You kidnapped him and had irreversible surgery done on him. \n\nYes, I know the owners were irresponsible about letting their intact cat out, but you could have educated them when you contacted them about their cat you picked up. But there is no law against what they did. Against what you did, yes. \n\nYou risked your entire TNR program over this.", "YTA, though the owners are a little wrong  for letting their cat roam outdoors, especially not neutered. \n\nYou\u2019re a way bigger, absolutely fucking massive asshole for knowingly taking someone\u2019s pet and forcing a surgical procedure on it, no matter how common the procedure is. You are 100% in the wrong here.", "As much as I support what you do, and would have at least been tempted to do if I was in your shoes, YTA.  Unfortunately you can't force anyone to do the right thing and keep pets responsibly.  \n\nI'd recommend giving their information to your local SPCA, though.  If they admit to allowing their intact male outdoors to breed (which is likely based on most of the local cats looking suspiciously like him) the SPCA might be able to hold them accountable for any costs or issues arising from their cat and his progeny.  Doubtful, but it's worth a shot.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer in the catch, fix, release for feral cat populations where homing isn\u2019t an option.  \n\nI\u2019m also a firm believer in that cats do not need to free roam to be happy, should NOT be let outside to do as they please, and they\u2019re healthier and safer as indoor only.  \n\nBut you did the bare minimum to nothing to get an obviously owned cat back to its owner before you had him neutered.  \n\nYTA", "YTA I hope you get sued and the family gets money from you as they should", "> I know I crossed a line\n\nNo matter how you _feel_ about un-neutered outdoor cats, you _know_ doing this to a non-stray is wrong.\n\nYTA and you already know it.

No. But its a possibility that you didn't even take into consideration and that's a huge asshole move.

It\u2019s no secret.", "YTA. \n\nI own two cats both spayed and indoor only cats. However, you knew this cat wasn't a stray cat or at very least likely suspected it. You didn't trap the cat and call the number. No, you took it to the vet, got it neutered, and then called the owners. Why? Because you knew there was a likelihood the owners wouldn't want it neutered. From your one comment sounds like you have done similar things before -- YTA. You could have called animal control, SPCA, whoever else to deal with this cat who wasn't a stray. But you didn't.", "Oh yes YTA\n\nFor all you knew, the cat had gotten out in error and was actually a papered cat, whom the owners used for breeding purposes.\n\nYou had absolutely NO right to have the cat neutered without permission of the owners.", "YTA. While I completely agree with neutering your pets and TNR programs, you could have gone through with this in a more productive way. \n\nFirst, you 100% should have informed the owners as soon as you caught the cat. It had a collar and you clearly identified that it was a pet. It\u2019s fair for them to be upset that you took their cat and did not alert them about it. \n\nAlso, you could have talked to them and told them about the benefits of doing TNR programs. You could have offered to pay for the procedure (which it sounds like you paid for it anyways). Education is key in these situations. They might not have even known that the cat is not neutered, given most cat owners do not take them to the vet. \n\nWhile I know you thought you were doing the right thing, it should have been done in a more productive manner. Also, they technically could sue you for property damage depending on where you live. At least where I am from, pets are property under the law so they would have a case for property damage.", "YTA\n\nIt had a collar, you knew it wasn\u2019t a stray.

And now you\u2019re mad they\u2019re not so very happy at your wonderful actions of neutering cats.\n\nIt was their cat, not yours. Not your cat to make decisions about. Many people own outdoor cats, not every outdoor cat is a stray. Yet you choose to take someone\u2019s cat and act self righteous.", "Like your not right but personally I think NTA. I agree with what you did. Pets shouldn\u2019t be outdoor animals and he was creating more cats and adding to the problem. They were irresponsible. You corrected an issue", "YTA \nIt is a medical procedure. You had no right to make that call. What if there was some crazy complication?

You can\u2019t make decisions about other people Pets", "Nta bc op says this Tom is out making kittens, meaning he didn't escape one day by accident.

Not your call to make - even if it is the right one.", "YTA as he was obviously owned and had a collar with the owners number.  You should have called them first.", " NTA. They are irresponsible pet owners and are endangering the community by having an unneutered male cat about. It\u2019s unethical and should be illegal.", "YTA\n\nIt was not a stray under the TNR definition and you should have contacted the owner before anything was done to the animal.

You do not always know best. You should have stayed in your lane.", "YTA. The cat does not belong to you. That\u2019s not your call to make regardless of what you think is the greater good.

Neutering is still surgery, with no knowledge of medical history. What if the cat had died from a bad reaction to anesthesia? Given that pets are generally considered property from a legal perspective, you could also be considered guilty of theft. Not your cat, not your decision.", "YTA\n\nYou had no idea if that cat has other health issues, you just took it upon yourself to make a medical decision FOR A CAT THAT WASN'T YOURS. I'd be calling you every name under the sun if you did that to one of my cats. \n\nI understand the whole not wanting more kittens to be born unnecessarily and trying to protect feral cat colonies but c'mon.

My friends TNR as well, but the rules are if you catch a cat with a collar or microchip, you have to either let the cat go or try to return them to the owner.  You are NOT to TNR someone's pet.  I fully agree that outdoor cats should not be a thing and that you should neuter your animals, but you can not make that choice for others.  The fact that the TNR vet still did it when the cat had a collar is baffling.  Both you and the vet are very likely to get in serious trouble if the owners decide to push for criminal charges.

We warned the group several times, and even offered to provide then with a scanning wand for microchips.  Well, it happened.  They chose not to listen and scooped up several owned cats.  No collar, microchipped. Domestic pets are property, and they got sued, and we are no longer associated with them if they are even still operating.  We heard from our county ACO that they were trespassed from several locations.\n\nYTA not only for taking and having a surgical procedure on someone\u2019s legal property, but you KNEW you were wrong.", "INFO: What reputable veterinarian performs non-emergent surgical operations on homed animals with virtually no notice and without permission from the owners?", "YTA, as much as it sucks letting an intact tom go back into the wild, you wildly overstepped.\n\n I've done a lot of  TNR over the years, I speak to you as a fellow rescuer.\n\nWe both know that \"never TNR an owned cat\" is a core philosophy of TNR programs.  In no small part, this is because doing so really harms public opinion of TNR programs and raises distrust that we are \"stealing pets\".\n\nYou know you always have to try to contact from any IDs first, be that microchip or collar and tag.

I am totally on board with neutering outdoor cats. \n\nBut this cat clearly had an owner that was quick to respond to a call. You ignored that and put their cat through an anesthetic  procedure. That could have resulted in death. Anesthesia isn\u2019t risk free. \n\nYou did not have the right, no matter your beliefs, to authorize surgery on a cat that had an owner. Period.", "YTA massively so. You had no right to make a medical decision for someone else's cat. They cat could've had a medical condition that made anesthesia lethal to them. Cats metabolism slows down when neutered, again you don't know the medical history. The owners might also just be scared due to trauma of such a procedure having gone wrong and that's why they didn't do it. Again  YOU HAVE NO IDEA. The owners picked the cat up within 20min, so they probably try to be mindful of their cat and this could've been the one time he got away. It's like taking someones child and putting a tattoo or something on them. A permanent decision THAT WASN'T YOURS TO MAKE.

Like I guess you could have called them that night but you called them in the morning. It's not like the cat could have gone home immediately after the procedure anyway. Ive had outdoor indoor cats when I was younger and didn't know better (both fixed tho) and they often would disappear overnight and show up the next day.

Non profit, I catch all cats and get them the medical attention they need myself, out of my own pocket. I love helping them. A lot of the cats are not able to be rehomed, so I fix them and release them. Get them their shots and hope for the best. I am not a large scale operation.\n\nRecently I was called to an area overrun with orange cats. They were everywhere and I mostly ended up handing it over to professionals.\n\nI did, however, manage to grab three very sweet cats. Two were terrified, skinny, a little beaten up, but overrall friendly. The third one was a little gent. \n\nHe was tubby, well groomed, fish patterned collar, the works. My plan was to find his parents and drop him off with a warning to keep him in due to the large amount of traps being set. Then the little bastard sprayed the inside of my car to the freakin max.\n\nSo, apparently, he wasn't fixed. I couldn't really tell (longhair) and assumed he was so left my covers off. Big mistake!\n\nI debated taking him home or taking him to get neutered with the rest. He was an indoor-outdoor cat (indicated by his collar tag) and with so many strays I'm certain some were carrying his genetics.\n\nUltimately I took him with me and got him neutered. No chip so I called the number on his tag and informed them where their cat was and gave them time slots to pick him up or have him dropped off.\n\nThe owners went ballistic. They were cursing me out and came to collect their cat not twenty minutes later. Called me a kidnapper, blamed me for their child having nightmares (scared over their cat going missing).\n\nI tried to explain that he needed to be fixed if he was going to be outside but they didn't want to know. They said I should have called immediately regardless.\n\nI spoke to my rescue friend who said I was in the wrong. Even though we know we are technically in the right, we didn't have the legal ground to do that and it wasn't my decision to make. \n\nI did apologise, but have blocked their numbers (the mom is flaming me on facebook and dm'ing people I know). I have a duty to care for stray cats. Me knowing an unneutered male was roaming free and not doing anything about it was a concern for said stray cats.\n\nThings are still tense between my rescue buddy and I and I don't completely disagree. I know I crossed a line even if it was for the greater good. People are finding out and taking sides, so I'm not sure who to really believe was \"right\" here.\n\nSo...
