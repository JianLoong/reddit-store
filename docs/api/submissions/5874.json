Kids aren't supposed to be little extracurricular college-scholarship machines. If she takes ASL at the community college, those credits WILL count toward her actual college, its a foreign language requirement at most schools so why not let her knock it out now while shes excited about it? Prioritize her as a WHOLE PERSON and not just a horse-rider.", "YTA for claiming financial stress but putting a priority on HORSE RIDING. \n\nIn another comment you said you feel like riding is your only way to connect with her but trust me, there are plenty of other ways to connect.\n\nEdit: bonus yta because the rock climbing membership was a gift (no cost to OP). Don't claim to have money problems when you don't, that's gross.", "YTA because you\u2019re deciding that riding is more important than her new interest. Explain to her that you can\u2019t afford riding, rock climbing, and sign language. If money is truly the problem, then communicate that to her! And then have her start learning sign language from online courses and YouTube videos. Then she can fit it in her to schedule without it breaking the budget.", "YTA. If finances and debt were a problem, you wouldn't be paying for riding lessons and competitions. She wants to learn another language and it's a very useful language at that. Let her.", "YTA to a certain extent. Dad's advice is reasonable. Be more honest with her about the financial responsibilities, give her a financial limit, and then let her figure out what she'll keep and drop.", "YTA. Does she actually *want* to do riding though? Forcing your kid to do an activity they have no interest in is definitely an AH move. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having them do an activity that\u2019s physical but sounds like she chose rock climbing as that activity.", "YTA only because it seems like you\u2019re making her do the activities you want her to do.

Why not talk to her about money managment and the fact you can\u2019t pay for all 3 activities so she\u2019d have to settle with 2 that she can choose.\n\nI was 12 when my parents gave me the choice to drop out of softball. I entered volleyball after that. Quit that and went back to softball. Then quit sports altogether when I was in high school. I got more into hiking and nature than I did sports.

Sounds like *you* should be going horse riding not her. You sound way into it.\n\nAlso, equestrian sports of any kind are a money pit. Wouldn't it free up a lot of money if the horse riding got dropped?", "You\u2019re not the asshole for not wanting to pay for her to take the classes, but YTA for acting like this is about finances and exercise when really it is about controlling her interests. I read in your comments that if you made her pick between riding or the lessons, she would pick to give up riding. You say you don\u2019t want to do that because you also used to ride, and it is something that you and your daughter can bond over and you don\u2019t want to lose that connection. Your daughter is not you. Your daughter does not need to have the same interests as you did when you were her age. At a certain point your children develop interests that aren\u2019t necessarily your own. If you want to bond with them, find a way to get interested in the things that are interesting to them instead of trying to force your interests. What if she drops the riding, took up the lessons, and you went to the community college to to also learn ASL? Your daughter is going to need someone to practice with in order to get proficient. Wouldn\u2019t it be a nice thing for you to do bond over if you both took the lessons and then could practice with each other?", "Kinda TA you can\u2019t afford a couple of hundred bucks but she can go rock climbing and horse riding. Why not tell her she can do activities out of the 3 and let her choose which ones. Sign language is a really good skills to have and could lead to well paying jobs etc.", "YTA. Sounds like she'd rather do ASL (I'm assuming you're in the US based on phrasing, but switch out for BSL or other relevant language if I'm wrong!) and climbing than riding, since it's already \"pushed to the back burner\".\n\nI understand the issues of time and finances, but a language class is a lot cheaper than horseback riding, and likely less time consuming too. Let her choose which 2 out of the 3 activities she wants to do - 2 of them are physical, so it's not like it's even possible for her to choose a schedule that doesn't have physical activity, so that argument also doesn't wash.", "INFO: Does she even want to continue riding lessons?\n\nWhy don't you ask her to choose her top two because she can't do everything. You don't have to go into detail but explain that financially as well as realistically, she cannot do all these hobbies. \n\nI find it hard to believe a sign language course could cost more than riding lessons.", "YTA. If she\u2019s also doing rock climbing multiple times a week it\u2019s not like the sign language classes would mean she\u2019s not doing anything physically active. And learning sign language is a really great thing. Great for her future, and being able to communicate with others, but also intellectually enriching! \n\nIt sounds like riding might be less important to her, and if that\u2019s the case you should talk to her about it, and see if it\u2019s something she really wants to do. If she does, let her try to balance all three things, but if she doesn\u2019t, allow her to stop riding. \n\nFinancial stuff is hard, and if you can\u2019t afford it then you can\u2019t afford it, but your husband seems to think there\u2019s a way, so maybe it\u2019s worth thinking a bit more about how you can make this happen for her", "YTA. She wants to do a good thing. What are you afraid of? They'll say how selfish and controlling you are in sign language?", "Learning ASL is an incredible skill that could help her get opportunities and make friends for the rest of her life. Please don't deprive her of something so great. It would look great on a college application too. Unless she wants to continue doing riding competitions for a living, I can't see why she shouldn't learn ASL. Riding is expensive and if she doesn't want to do it anymore then switch her to ASL. Let her interests dictate her extracurriculars so that she doesn't feel like they're a chore and stop doing them altogether. Sit her down and tell her that you can only afford 2 of her extracurriculars right now and that she can choose whichever 2 she wants. This is a great teaching moment and you really have an opportunity to set her up for success here. Also, learning a language young is sooooo much easier than waiting. Learning ASL opens your eyes to a whole new world of culture and people that you didn't even know existed and it's right under your nose. YWBTA if you don't let her make the choice herself.", "WOW!  YTA and so what if she says \"no\" to doing anything that she doesn't want to do.  So what if she doesn't want to \"ride at the level she's been\"  She's 13 and you sound very controlling.  If she said she would rather take the ASL course over riding would you let her?  Or would you tell her \"no\" because of the money you have spent on her riding?  That thinking that because YOU have put so much money into it that she is now obligated to do something she doesn't want to anymore is above controlling.  It's abuse.  Ever seen the movie \"Mommy Dearest\"?", "YTA for not letting her expand her interests. It sounds like you're more interested in her competing than she is.", "Great time for a lesson in time management. I agree with the husband regarding letting her sink or swim if she tries all three. However, if you're serious about the financial portion, then maybe she should choose between the ones she really wants to do as you're paying for it.", "Just have her cut down on both the riding lessons and the rock climbing, unless she is competing in either sport. \n\nNeither of those two need to be done more than once if not competitive and money is an issue. \nShe already knows how to ride and climb. After that it\u2019s just for practice. \n\nPlus I think learning sign language is awesome.", "YTA, but she doesn't have to take an in person class to learn sign language. Youtube exists. She can study on her own time.", "YTA. If you're concerned about making sure that your daughter does a physical activity, then I have some great news for you about what rock-climbing is. \n\nThat said, YOU clearly want your daughter to continue riding at a competitive (?) level, but what does SHE want? What are HER priorities, and what would SHE prefer to do if it'll only be possible for her to do a couple of the listed activities? Your husband and brother both offered reasonable solutions to the money problem, whether or not you're embarrassed about it. \n\nAnd what does it matter if the impetus for your daughter pursuing sign language is that she wants to take after your brother? If he's also learning sign language, then that's GREAT; she'll have someone to learn and practice with. If she decides to drop after a semester, then so be it. But c'mon, OP, don't stand in the way of your daughter's clear interest in learning something new and cool.", "YTA You are clearly the one who wants your daughter to be into riding, and you're pissed she's developing other interests. Stop trying to force your children into YOUR hobbies.", "YTA for making your daughter do activities you want her to do, rather than her choosing what she wants to do. You sound like you are the one pushing her into riding, and if she chose a sign language course that conflicts with riding, that seems to indicate that she would rather do that. Also horse back riding doesn't involve much physical activity - unless you're the horse. You say money is tight, but also the sign language course would be way less expensive than riding lessons, and if she stopped the riding then you would have more than enough money for the course. A non-AH parent would present your daughter with the choice of the sign language course OR the riding and accept their choice. Which I'm doubting you will do.", "INFO: Why can't you tell a 13yo you aren't made of money?\n\nHorseriding, climbing and a college class aren't cheap hobbies. Make her choose that way you're not the bad guy- it's her choice.", "Sounds like you're trying to dictate her interests. Like, you wanted to ride when you were young, so you're pushing it on her. \n\nLearning another language will help her in the real world. Riding a horse, not so much. \n\nI don't think you're an asshole especially, because it does cost and you can't afford it with her other things. Maybe sit her down and explain that you can only pay for X number of activities, and she needs to reevaluate her schedule if she wants to learn ASL.\n\nI hope you can let her learn. My son was born hard of hearing, and Sign has helped so much. \n\nNTA, but you're kinda bordering it.", "YTA \nFor forcing your kids into what you want them to do and be instead of letting them lead with their interests. \nChildren are not your dolls.", "sign language will put her ahead of alot of people when it comes to work or study in the future maybe look at it as an investment in her future  and maybe the money from one of the other extra ciriculars to pay for it", "YTA if you don\u2019t at least have a more involved conversation about this.\n\nAre your child\u2019s activities her choice or yours?  Have you discussed with her if she is outgrowing her desire to ride/compete?  Have you looked into free resources for learning ASL so she can try it to see if it is something she wishes to learn to a deeper level.  I\u2019m learning ASL online, at my own pace, for free.  Lessons, quizzes etc., all developed by a deaf/hard of hearing ASL teacher who wanted to make this language more accessible for people.\n\nFor anyone who may be interested check out lifeprint.com.  *note: I\u2019ve no direct connection with this site and receive no benefit from anyone visiting it.  Simply a resource I\u2019m glad I found when deciding to learn ASL to better communicate with some of the deaf members I assist at work.", "Gentle YTA because I see from your comments that a big reason you want her to continue riding is because that's what YOU want, not what she wants. \n\nI understand that you want her to keep riding because of how it has bonded you two together and because of your lineage of horse riders, that's totally fair. But here's the thing - she's her own person with her own autonomy. You have to give her the space to make her own decisions even if you don't agree with those decisions. You can openly and honestly express to her the way you feel about it, but guilting or shaming her into continuing riding to save your feelings would make you the AH and more than likely push her away from you. It sounds like continuing the horse riding legacy is important to you, so I really wanna caution you against trying to force her to continue riding. If you force her, she may grow to resent riding, and ultimately you, and she may choose to break the chain because of it and even put distance between you two. But if you give her the space to choose, she may go try other things and eventually miss riding and come back to it. \n\nSo here's what I'd recommend - share your honest feelings about riding with her and why you'd love it if she continued riding. This will show her you care about what she wants and give her the space to be honest back to you. This vulnerability builds trust between you, yay! Accept whatever she tells you, even if it's that she wants to quit riding for now. Enroll her in those ASL classes using the money saved from riding lessons. I would also encourage you to take this a step further and try to learn ASL from her after school. This is going to have a couple of benefits - it'll show her you're genuinely interested in her learning, it'll give her the space to get excited about what she's learned, it'll help her learn ASL better, and you might even learn ASL and be able to have a special language that you and your daughter can speak together and bond over. Extra benefit - you'd be able to talk with her uncle too, which might bring him closer to you too. This is all win win win! \n\nYour daughter is growing and changing. Grow and change with her and watch your relationship blossom into a whole new thing. You don't have to let go of the reins, just ease up off them. You got this! Best of luck to you!", "This is really simple -- let your daughter know that she has the time and you have the money for two of the three activities (riding, rock climbing, and sign language). She gets to choose which two.\n\nOf course YTA if she picks rock climbing and sign language and then you tell her no anyway because you'd rather force your hobby on her.", "Sorry but YTA. She's 13 and has taken an interest in sign language...amazing (even if its to copy your bro). Be glad she's willing to learn and expand her mind", "YTA. Sign language is a lot better on a resume than horse riding.", "> I feel it\u2019s important for my kids to have some kind of physical activity or sport to keep them healthy, and taking this course would interfere with her riding lessons\n\nJudging by this and your other mention of it - it kind of seems like *you* really want her to ride horses... which I'm going to toss in... is not a physical activity... \n\nIf the money is an issue - there's are *countless* online courses that are free and wonderful for sign language learners. \n\nIf the time is an issue - you need to explain to your daughter about time management.\n\nYTA. Don't ever tell a child they can't learn something.", "NAH but have you asked her if she would prefer to do sign or riding? Sounds like you want her to continue riding but does she? That might free up some money and time?", "NAH.  You and your spouse are the parents decide how much riding, rock climbing, etc your child takes.  You also are responsible for teaching your children time management and real life consequences.  You are not their employee.  If that means less rock climbing b/c of sign language then fine.  If it means not riding at that 'level' let your daughter know what choice means.  Also what bad mouthing you will mean for her activities in the future.  Is she heading to the Olympics?  Scholarships with riding?  Sign language opens a whole new world for her and volunteer opportunities with working with the deaf community.  I have to side with your spouse on this one.", "NAH just tell her money is tight and tell her to pick which activities she wants  to do/keep problem solved", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. \n\nYour daughter has expressed interest in learning ASL, which is considered to be another language (I think, correct me if I\u2019m wrong) and that\u2019s admirable. Does she even want to do horseback riding? I also understand wanting her to do something physical, but have you discussed that with her. Yes, community college classes cost money, but once she gets into high school she can do dual enrollment and get college credit while in high school\u2014which will look good on college applications. \n\nHowever, you can explain your financial situation to her. 13 is old enough to understand that on some level and it\u2019s also an important discussion on what her priorities actually are.", "NTA. Kids extra curricular activities should be logically limited. Tell her to pick the 2 she wants to do most and that\u2019s it and if she really persists, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t explain why: can\u2019t afford, don\u2019t have time, etc etc.", "It's easy to learn sign language online or on apps. \nMany lessons are free.", "NAH - at 13 your daughter can start learning what it takes to make a household run. You don't have to open the bank account and let her see everything, but you could sit down with a calendar and basic budget if her interest and let her see how she can't do it all. As she grows up ans gets ready for college and life she needs to know how to balance her wants and needs and this is a great place to start.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t she start with YouTube tutorials? They\u2019re free, and you can learn anywhere, anytime.", "NAH - sounds like you're juggling a lot.\n\nLet your brother pay for the lessons. He offered, so there is no shame in accepting. If it really bothers you though, perhaps tell him that it counts as her birthday and/or christmas gift for the coming year. Worst case scenario, he and your daughter have something to bond over.\n\nI would also take the time to sit down with your daughter and discuss the realities of finances. She's old enough to know that there isn't an endless supply of money, but she's also at the age where things (ie gifts, clothing, electronics, hobbies) that are more expensive will seem more appealing, especially as she explores what she wants to do with her time/life. Having a clearer idea of the actual cost of things vs how long it will take to save for something may help with prioritising what's genuinely important to her in the future.", "NTA, exactly, but I feel there needs to be some reconfiguring of priorities. \n\nKid has no choice but to do at least one physical thing to remain healthy. Horseback riding isn\u2019t the only option. A cheaper alternative would be exercises at home, strength-based, cardio, yoga, whatever. A couple dumbbells and a yoga mat can go a long way and may be cheaper than horse lessons. \n\nSame with sign language. There are apps and online courses that could be cheaper than going to the college, and would teach her just as effectively. And can be self-paced so to not overwhelm her with things she already has going on. It kind of lets her build her own schedule. \n\nYou are coming from a place of concern about finances and her having enough time. YWBTA if you didn\u2019t even consider letting her learn, but it sounds like you\u2019re willing to, and if her schedule doesn\u2019t work with it, she will learn the hard way that she will need to prioritize certain things or shift what she\u2019s doing to still achieve the same outcome.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Definitely a great exercise for a teenager.

If my kids have taught me anything, the more you force them into something, the more they won't want to. If you want access to the shows, get back in the saddle.\n\nSign language will get her further in jobs than horse riding will (unless she's been hand picked for the Olympics/HOYS etc). Her horse will keep her learning even not competing. A true horsewoman should realise that", "I know what horseback riding costs. Your story doesn\u2019t add up. Assuming she is competing in either English or Barrel (or both), you should be spending more *per month* on riding than that sign language class costs, and if the kid wants to learn something actually potentially useful to skip a few days with a pony, not sure what the (real) possible issue is?\n\nGiving benefit of doubt\u2026.\nHaving a conversation that asks her to rank and define priorities is a good positive thing to do as a parent. We had to do that with ours around Irish dance - another very expensive and competitive sport. Both from a time and monetary investment, we discussed it with our daughters. And being somewhat open about these things being expensive in time and money, and choices needing to be made, we found only helped prepare our daughters a bit for life.\n\nBut what I suspect\u2026.\nI smell a parent living vicariously through her child\u2019s riding competitive level, however, and that isn\u2019t so good. Time with her uncle learning a really neat life skill versus a few extra rides on a horse, or another competition, shouldn\u2019t even be a question or concern. You should be thrilled if that is her preference, not dismayed!", "YTA. 13 is old enough to understand some practical realities. Explain to her that there\u2019s not enough money and time to do all 3 activities and she has to pick 2. \n\nKids aren\u2019t mini-mes. They are their own people with their own interests. The more you try to force them to do what you want them to do, the further away they\u2019ll run when they are able. If she\u2019s less interested in riding than she used to be, and you force her to keep at it because it\u2019s important to you, she\u2019ll only resent you for it. I took piano lessons for years longer than I wanted to because my mom wanted me to. All that came of it was years of wasted time and money. My heart wasn\u2019t in it so I didn\u2019t enjoy it, I didn\u2019t progress my skill level, my mom was frustrated that she had to drag me to every lesson, and my teacher wasted her time with a student who didn\u2019t want to be there, wasn\u2019t absorbing anything, and hated every minute.
