Part of the way they do this is to experiment with new things, often intentionally things that their parents don't like. It's a normal developmental stage, and it's silly to get upset about it. We should be *happy* that she is experimenting with something as innocuous as clothing, rather than all of the dangerous things she could be experimenting with. It's also incredibly counterproductive to complain about her clothing choices: she's either doing it because she truly likes it (in which case you are just being rude and teaching her that it is okay to insult other people's taste in clothing) or she's doing it because she knows you don't like it (in which case, you're giving her exactly the reaction she wants)\"\n\nNTA, and it sounds like your husband needs to take a serious chill pill. Does he not remember what it was like to be a teenager in the '90s? I'm the same age as him, and probably half the girls at my school picked up the goth aesthetic at some point during the high school years... \n\nOh, and the correct response to \n\n>she\u2019s not listening to what I ask\n\nis \"You shouldn't be asking it\"", "NTA\n\nShe's 17 and frankly not his daughter. She's about to be an adult and then will dress however she DAMN WELL WANTS and will likely no further contact with your husband.\n\nHis \"concerns\" about her body autonomy are none of his business.", "NTA. It doesnt seem her clothes are overly inappropriate and it seems very typical clothing for a teen. Seems your husband is just overly bothered. Teens shouls be able to express themselves if its nor harmful,this IMO isnt harmful.", "NTA. And it bothers me that your husband cares this much...", "[removed]", "NTA- as long as she's not dressing inappropriately, she should be left alone. She sounds like a normal teenager trying to express herself, which is healthy! Your husband's issue is not. He's the one with a problem.", "NTA. Not sure why he is paying so much attention and cares so much about what she wears. Especially since you, her mother doesn't mind. Good for you for allowing her to express herself. Also, I do get why he'd be concerned about wearing open-toe shoes in the winter because, huh? lol", "NTA. She is 17. Of course she is going to start experimenting with sexiness in her clothing. This is normal and healthy. Tell him you will monitor when enough is enough and to knock off the griping as all it will do is add fuel to any teenage rebellion fire that might be a part of this. \n\nAdditionally, if he is getting distracted by her maturing- maybe the two of you need to have a whole other conversation as sexualizing your daughter is not okay. Because her need to have a safe space to grow up comes first.", "NTA - She has a right to express her self and kudos to you for being a supportive mother even though you don't like it. There seems to be a deeper issue with him sexualizing your daughter though.", "Your daughter is 17 years old; less than a year away from being an adult. By attempting to dictate how your daughter dresses you\u2019re just going to push her away. You only have months left before she\u2019s a legal adult and can make the choice to have a relationship with you or not!\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not worth it at this point to comment on her clothing choices, and your husbands continuous complaints about it probably make her want to do it even more! Purposefully wearing things to annoy him vs wearing it just because it\u2019s her style. This is typical teen behavior and most often a phase. Tell your husband to stop bringing it up, she\u2019s not hurting anyone or hurting herself, and unless you want a huge wedge in your relationship with your child just let it go!\n\nNTA", "NTA, even if he was her bio dad, I think its great you are supporting her in finding her own personality and style.

How do you do that? Lean into it. Instead of leaving it as her \"dumb\" clothing choice, embrace the style and the direction it goes in, teaching her to feel free to be true to herself. How do I know? I've had my share of wearing steelbone corsets and listening to Sisters of Mercy in school, I faced backlash and survived but This would've been helpful to have:\n\nThere are distinctions between punk, emo and goth, and I will bust out the dissertation on the subject if anyone wants a breakdown among the three subcultures. Getting a sense of her music would be very helpful as far as finding an aesthetic. Then you can look up her favorite bands, take notes of the way they dress, and even if they are extreme in tattoos and piercings find Something in their photos that may be tasteful, like incorporating color as an accent in clothing, in makeup, or highlights and lowlights in hair. Maybe somebody wears fishnets without oversexualizing them. If her favorite female singer is wearing lipstick that is NOT black, perhaps she'd be more willing to move away from it.\n\nHopefully this makes sense, see it as a chance to bond, and even have fun helping her embrace her uniqueness. Done right, could inspire her career wise as well, such as fashion design or beauty consultant. I'm getting ahead of myself, but point is, resist the urge to judge her, don't try to force anything and basically look for the opportunity to get closer - take her shopping or find a hairdresser who specializes in alternative style.

I'm not sure there's a good solution that will bring your household peace, though. This is the man you married. Is it possible for him to do some introspection, why he needs to have this amount of control over het clothes?", "He\u2019s not very familiar with teens. LOL\n\nI will admit that I (44F) made my step daughters change sometimes before school if they were wearing stuff that:\n\n1) didn\u2019t meet school dress code. I did this because they would regularly be sent home from school when at their mom\u2019s due to dress and I was not in a position to drive an hour from my office if they got kicked out to go home and change when they were with us (and my husband was out of state so I was the only adult)\n\n2) if it wasn\u2019t weather appropriate in winter. We live in a very cold place and cars and busses and stuff can get stuck or break down. You may have to walk always or sit tight in the cold waiting for help. So if they wanted to wear something pretty skimpy (but still allowed) I\u2019d make them put on a sweatshirt and coat for travel at least. In your slipper example, I would make them wear proper snow boots and take their cute shoes in a bag to change into. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA and it seems like your husband needs to just relax. If they\u2019re not breaking school rules and aren\u2019t at physical risk, I don\u2019t see the issue. And I\u2019m a big meant doo doo head stepmom.

Now I\u2019m so clean cut (aside from some tattoos that aren\u2019t visible with a shirt) most people would be surprised to know I had the look as a teen. \n\nIf you\u2019re husband respects her look, but within reason (nothing overly sexual) than I think he is just being a good dad. It\u2019s a fine line.", "NTA\n\nI'm a father to an alt-girl.  She loves her style.  Separates her from all the \"basic\" girls in her school.  Totally support her, even bring her to get piercings.  My support buys some say in what she chooses to wear.  If she chooses something too low cut, I'll ask if she will be comfortable wearing that.  \n\n\"Yeah, I got the perfect sweater to go with it.\"\n\"Fine.\"\n\nSince fashion is important for her, she has been learning to sew.  14yrs old and is wearing stuff she made.  Her mom wears some the dresses she made for her too.\n\nGoing thrifting is one of the bonding activities we enjoy.  Last week we got in a fight over who got to keep the floral shirt.\n\nAnyhow, critize her and watch her drift away, or support her and have a better relationship.", "NTA it isn't his place at all to even comment", "Never TA for supporting your child instead of automatically siding with your husband when you don't agree with him.\n\nAlso, parenthood is going to be very rough for him if he doesn't learn that the more you push children, they will push back. This is a phase she might just grow out of, but if she knows it bothers him she will likely double down and do it even more. \n\nIf he wants to get her to stop, rather than arguing with her HE should start dressing like that, and matching her.

First she is 17. So if it's not weather appropriate she will experience the consequences for that. Also she is 17 so she is plenty old enough to make the decision on what she would wear. I can understand if something is extremely sexual in nature, for instance I probably won't be okay with a shirt that says \"I'm a horny s***\" on my child. And if they're living in my house I would insist on never seeing that shirt. But at 17 I couldn't force them to never wear it. Because they will if they want to. It is also reasonable to insist that the clothing you purchase for her be treated with respect or she has to replace it out of her own money. So if a concern is that she's wearing slippers outside in the winter and they are getting ruined, that's a legitimate complaint. The answer to that is she purchases her own slippers that she can wear outside but not the ones you purchased. Otherwise there's nothing to be said. He's trying to control something that cannot be controlled. And he knows it which is why he's complaining about asking her and her not listening. He knows he can't tell her.

From what you said about throwing out the shirt with the skeleton hands on the breasts, I think you agree on some level (though correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nShe is 17 though, practically an adult already, I don't think he should harp on her like he is about her clothing choices, at least at this age.", "NTA.", "NTA.

Nope.\n\nI think I started figuring out fashion beyond \"edgy\" t-shirts somewhere in late high school/early college, and am quite happy about this.

Women who don't wear make-up to work every day get told that their appearances aren't clean or professional enough. Women with bigger hips/butts get scolded for wearing ANY tight-ish bottoms. \n\nI could go on and on. The point is that the rhetoric of \"appearances matter in the workforce\" apply to women very, very differently than they apply to men. Just look at the difference between dress codes in schools for girls and boys. The same thing happens in the professional workforce. A man can show up to work with combed hair in a button-down and any pants and be deemed professional enough, especially if he does his job well. A man is judged by how well he does his job and his work ethic and that's about it. A woman can show up wearing a pantsuit and loafers and be the best in the business at what she does and *still* get sent home or talked to by HR for not wearing make-up, or not straightening/styling her hair, or not wearing heels/pretty ballet flats, or having her bra strap showing. Because a woman is judged by her outward appearance and her attractiveness (or lack thereof) to others, while *her* ability to do her work and her work ethic is sidelined. A woman is expected to automatically shoulder all the responsibility of how everyone around her (especially men) perceives her. If a man can't get his work done because he's too busy ogling her cleavage, that's on her for wearing something that doesn't hide the fact that she has breasts, not on him for being an unprofessional creep who can't keep his eyes to himself and views his female co-workers solely as sexual objects."]}
