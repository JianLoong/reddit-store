Especially if they serve pizza! Idk why the manager said that as you left, you ate a piece there and left. Furthermore, if they have the takeaway boxes there's no reason for them to be so stringent.\n\nHonestly, I'd almost go with NAH. However, unless you guys know this manager it rubs me the wrong way that she would say that. Like you two could've just taken your business else where, THEY'RE the ones being inconvenient not offering the choice anymore.", "NTA. What do they mean the don't do take-away? You bought the pizza, you can definitely take it with you.", "YTA - clever but ah. They don\u2019t do take away for a reason, likely short staffed. You beat the system I suppose, but you\u2019re kind of a dick for doing it.", "Fair if we were in the states. But we are in Australia where tipping is not a thing."]}
