Is she really only worth her salary to you?  Because that\u2019s what you just told her.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s a pretty lousy thing to create relationship inequalities.  My husband and I have always treated all of our income as belonging to both of us, even though I have very little, unpredictable income due to being disabled.  My parents and my in-laws do the same (and my mom was the breadwinner).\n\nSo if you don\u2019t have the same amount of fun money, then IMO a maid should be treated as a shared expense and split according to income, because otherwise you\u2019re saying \u201cWife, you don\u2019t deserve the same things in life as me.

While this may seem \"fair\" on paper, in practice it is not. \n\nI am also confused as to why you need a maid to come to your house 3 days a week?

But whatever.  \n\nI'm torn on the actual question, though. It's your money, so you can do with it what you want, but only doing your days seems almost seems... spiteful. I'm leaning towards NTA because it's pretty par for the course on your marriage setup.", "YTA. I make more than my husband. I pay a higher percentage of the bills.

I think they should both appreciate what each brings \"to the table\". 80% of the bills is really fantastic (as I sit here paying 99% of my family's bills nothing from hubby) but he can't say that she isn't bringing an equal amount of value to the relationship. If he wanted more than she's giving, maybe he needs to find someone who makes more money who can pay 50% of the bills and draw up a contract and treat it all as business transactions. They're supposed to be supporting each other every day, every step of the way. \n\nWhy is their house needing cleaning 7 days a week, though? Something is weird about that.", "I have adhd too. And even living in a 1 bedroom I get discombobulated. My sister came over to help me do some deeper cleaning this past weekend in exchange for some baked goods and a girls night where I host (and pay for dinner) in the future. \n\nWhen I buy a home in the future I will be planning in my budget the cost of a biweekly cleaner. I can keep things straighter between cleanings then.", "Now I\u2019m curious what the teens we\u2019re responsible for doing. But yes, it sounds like a very cold and sterile marriage.", "Is he hiring a maid to make the bed and load the dishwasher each day...? I just don't see how else having a maid visit 3 days each week doesn't mean everything gets done.", "It takes the cleaners 2 hours a week to clean 1/2 the house -- the kids' rooms and our room were responsible for.   \n\nDo they have a fully furnished mansion?", "We were 4 kids in our household, and the cleaner coming once per week was enough to keep up with us. Especially as we got older, my mom would have us tidy up the night before so the cleaner could do a proper clean (vacuum, mop, oil the counters, etc.). My mom didn't want her wasting time on things like putting dishes in the dishwasher or moving our school bags.", "I do it too & the only person who wanted me to come multiple days had a gigantic house. Even then it was M, W, F, not 3 days in a row", "Only thing I can think of is if they have kids", "Lots of people don't split finances."]}
