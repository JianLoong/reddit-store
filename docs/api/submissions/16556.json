Then she has space, they have space with possibly slightly lower rent to save up for finding a different space, you can ease into the not having that extra income, and then when they have moved on you can either sell the tiny homes or set them up as air b&bs.", "Did you guys not discuss this before getting married?!", "YTA", "I wonder if your wife actually wants to leave because she found out you\u2019re commenting on nsfw posts \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA generally married people live together as a couple, without room-mates.", " YTA.

That's how marriage works. Together, you are renting it out. The 30 days thing seems intense, but this isn't the first time she's raised this issue, right?  She's been \"compromising\" for as long as you've been living together. You've had three years to figure out a solution that *actually* makes you both happy and you've failed to do anything about it.\n\nYou're choosing a supplemental income that you (together, because you are a married couple) don't need over your own wife. No wonder she's questioning this relationship.", "If she\u2019s your room mate (sounds that way) then choose your other room mates to stay, for the $$$.  \n\nIf she\u2019s your wife (time to change your attitude), then get rid of the room mates. \n\nIt is entirely normal for a married couple to live in their home without room mates.

She has been miserable for the whole time now\u2026.", "She sucks for not being able to compromise. NTA. I bet she won't leave if you don't act on her demands but if she does she deserves it. Your alternative solution seems reasonable enough, or you could do half a year but she is demanding them to move out like right now is not reasonable.", "Info: How much income does your wife contribute? Would she be paying the amount of having the roommates? Also talk to her about extending the time.", "NAH - I get that you want to be fair to them and are willing to compromise but your wife wants some privacy\u2026 something I\u2019m sure most married couples want to have.

That\u2019s some landlord shit, and while I guess you are a landlord, the tenants are friends and family. Maybe you can compromise on six months?", "NTA, and your wife might be the devil. She's giving you an ultimatum, sign of being an asshole. She's saying she can pay the difference when she's currently STILL in debt, sign of being delusional. She's making a non-issue into a huge issue, sign of being a control freak. Hope you signed a prenup, my guy.", "NTA, don\u2019t listen to her it\u2019s your choice.

Enjoy being single again. YTA", "ESH. I would discuss a compromise of\n6 months to give your roommates time to find a place. She clearly wants to spend private time with you.

It\u2019s hard to feel comfortable in your own home with roommates.", "Kids have always been off the table for both of us, my wife lived in this house with us prior to our being married and roommates were never an issue. After proposal and marriage nothing was brought up about eliminating roomies. A year or so into our marriage she floated the idea and I was the only bread winner at the time, then covid happened and she was still unemployed. So we could literally not afford to do what she wanted at that time.

Not an AH move.", "No. She doesn\u2019t want to live with other people anymore. They are a married couple.

(You don't mention what her salary is.)", "I think this happened because at this point this is too late. \n\nShe has expressed her wants to be alone, nothing has been done until now and she reached her limit.\n\nThis will be very hard.", "When she was in debt(still is) and out of work? Look I get it, I wouldn\u2019t want to live with roommates either, but feelings on the topic don\u2019t trump economics. 30 days without a concrete understanding of budget is a non starter. If she is that fed up she needs to go, rushed ultimatums without thinking through the logistics is never the answer.", "Sounds like a good compromise would be to keep the tenants but get rid of the roommates.", "Yes the house is a two family. My unit is two stories and has 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room, kitchen, dining room, Sun room, and a mud room. I rent the two spare bedrooms to my friend and my cousin.

Good luck", "Don\u2019t want roommates for life and am willing to compromise with the wife.

It\u2019s brilliant honestly. I get the arrangement won\u2019t work forever but if she can\u2019t magically replace that income it\u2019s not a good plan.", "Thanks ! Fingers crossed", "So.. you have owned a house for 10 years, still have roommates, and want to wait until you\u2019re 40 and purchase another home to be roommate free? \n\nYea, no. That wouldn\u2019t fly with me. You\u2019re more willing to purchase another property and keep housing your buds, than you are to live alone with your own wife. How does that even make sense?", "keep the roommates you have already put up with for three years for another year is not a reasonable compromise", "No they couldn\u2019t afford it. Now they can, and should, but 30 days isn\u2019t realistic. A year might be too long, but until they actually crunch the numbers no one knows. I am not loaded, but I\u2019m not struggling, and $coming up with an extra 1600 a month every month wouldn\u2019t be easy, and would come with some major lifestyle changes.", "Would it put you guys in debt not having that extra income? Would it take longer for her to get out of debt? How would it financially effect your life? How often are you guys getting alone time?", "Sure.  Not everyone considers 'living alone' to be such a horrible thing.", "Literally pats the mortgage I just cover the utilities and maintenance/ upkeep of the property", "No he's saying he wants the roommates for another year and then they buy another property when \"they're\", read the wife, are debt free.  The wife wants to kick them out in 30 days.  This would mean the wife wouldn't be debt free for another 5 years thus delaying them getting another property until they're 40.", "No. They need privacy.

They will have this one to themselves", "And what does any of that have to do with my comment? I do think they should live alone, but I also think they need to have an actual financial plan, and give the roommates a little more notice. I had a 30 day notice once when my longtime cool landlord died, and his kids couldn\u2019t sell the place fast enough, I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.", "curious where ur getting the \"frivolous spending\" idea. could be that her debt is from education. it appears she's employed now, and she'd be taking money from her debt payments to cover the bills. maybe not the choice i'd make if i didn't have to, and there's definitely a compromise in here somewhere, but i don't think it's right to assume she's spending frivolously based on what we have", "I\u2019m really torn on this one. I feel like I have to go with NAH. I get how she\u2019d want to have alone time in the house but I also get how it would have a negative effect on income", "You don't need 2 houses, my dude. You already have one. Housing is an essential human need, don't hoard it.", "It's always amazing how poor some people's reading comprehension is.\n\nNTA by the way.  Your idea is a far smarter way to go about this.  As a fellow 30 something year old, I have a feeling a lot of these comments are from young people who don't realize how short a single year is.", "I was focused on the relationship not the budget. They need to get rid of the roommates before the financial plan.\n\nIf they're month yo month tenants and likely know the wife wants them gone, 30 days is enough.", "Focusing on the relationship without the budget is silly and immature. Also 30 days for no other reason than your wife wants them gone is an ass hole move to friends and family. As I have said I do think they should figure out a real plan to live independently, but rushing it is asking for trouble.Sometimes in life there is that one point where you can pinpoint it all went wrong. This has that potential for Op. \nFirstly I would be dubious of the long term prospects with any partner that\u2019s already threatened to leave me, no matter the reason.     Especially throwing financial problems, and the loss of a care free lifestyle in the mix.\nSecondly I would be apprehensive of the ability of a partner with debt issues, periods of unemployment, and no track record  at all of paying any rent or utilities, to contribute monthly in a meaningful way.\nAlso I would be mindful that I risked loosing the house and years of equity, if they did fall behind.\nAnd while I don\u2019t think kicking the roommates out with 30days notice would end the relationships,they will likely take a hit."]}
