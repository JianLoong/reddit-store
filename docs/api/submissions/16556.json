Yes, cheaper, but he\u2019s NOT LISTENING to her. She\u2019s telling him (and probably has in the past, people don\u2019t always go straight to the ultimatum) she can\u2019t live like that anymore. She needs peace and privacy and to be able to breathe in her own air! Heck, what if she wanted to surprise him with some sexi time when he got home from work? Can\u2019t meet him at the door. And heck, gotta moderate how quiet you are at all times. No bueno.", "I'm guessing this isn't the first time she's expressed unhappiness about the situation, but it's the first time that OP started listening.", "I, too, would offer to help her pack.

'Okay, whelp, bye there's the door'. \n\n\nAnd, frankly, even though I understand her feelings and get why she'd want to be alone... in these times of inflation, that just seems like the worst idea. They've already got a sweet situation going on money-wise. Why ruin it? So I guess from the start I'm on the husband's side of thing re money.", "I don't like the out-of-the-blue ultimatum either. But I'm wondering if this is a case where wife has been saying that she is uncomfortable with roommates, or hinting around the idea that now might be a good time to end their leases, and husband has not been listening, and now she's fed up at being unheard and has dropped the hammer? \n\nOP does say that 'it wasn't economically feasible, so no big deal, right?' \n\nMaybe it *is* a big deal for wife and she's been putting up with it for three years and has now had enough of sharing her house with people she doesn't want to share with. And husband is like 'this is entirely new information that you have never expressed before', so she's ready to nope out of a marriage where husband does not listen or take her side into consideration.", "While I agree with you generally, something makes me think this might have come up in the past, but OP wasn\u2019t listening, or didn\u2019t understand exactly what the wife was saying.

She only started working recently at age 34? \n\nIt sounds like she got very lucky with this guy or she'd be living on the streets right now. \nWaiting 1 more year to get yourself debt free and gain financial stability is so much more important.\n\nOf course the ideal situation would be to move out together or kick the roommates out, but if youre in debt and only recently started working, its just not possible and youre living in a dream world.\n\nNever having to pay for anything, not even rent, seems to make you forget the value of money.", "I mean yes? Like can they afford to have these people move out? Someone has to think about money.", "What? Where did you see that? That makes EVERYTHING different.

It\u2019s fair that she states her boundary.", "It\u2019s come up before.  OP says the last time they talked about it was in 2021, and that it wasn\u2019t economically feasible at the time.\n\nIt may well be that OP has been refusing to hear here frustration with the situation.  If so, I agree he\u2019s an asshole for that.\n\nI still think that a compromise which gives the renters more notice would be the right thing to do as landlords in that situation.", "Giving 30 days is an AH move though, especially when the tenants are friends and family.", "Did she express a partial plan for making this happen though? An idea without a plan of execution is an emotional reaction.", "She\u2019s offering to cover half of it now.", "Yes, they can afford to have the people move out.

My supervisor above him lives with his brother (who is also a supervisor in the same company) and our company pays decent. Cost of living here is just RIDICULOUS.
