However, she consistently treated me horribly throughout our friendship. She would call me names behind my back, try to one-up me and compete with me, would make me feel bad on purpose, and used me to advance her career. \n\nLet me give a few examples. She would constantly make plans with me and then cancel on me day of or just straight up ignore my texts asking to hang out. I communicated how this was hurting me, and she apologized and offered to make plans with me just to air me AGAIN. \n\nOne day, after airing me for months, she made plans with me. A week after we hung out she texted me asking me if I can talk to my dad to see if she can intern at his business over the summer. I got her the internship and then she ghosted me again.\n\nShe would constantly brag about how all her friends are rich and popular, and how she would go to all these fancy clubs because she was friends with promoters. She told me that we could go together one day and then when I responded saying I\u2019d be down she never opened my message. She would send me pictures of the \u201chot guys\u201d she was getting with and brag about how many men wanted her and then put me down when I showed her a man I was talking to, telling me they were \u201cugly.\u201d I included this example to show how she tried to one up me.

You don't have to be nice to someone who treats you like dirt.", "Nta, I feel for you being forced to be around someone you dislike.  Your parents disrespected you in actuality.  They can still be friends with her parents, but can't force you to see her.  It's that simple.", "NTA \n\nOften it is best to just be polite and have a quick greeting and light chats with people to be polite. \n\nBut she has gone out of her way to use and abuse you! \n\nYou are 100% entitled to totally ignore her! She does not deserve your friendship or attention. \n\nYour Dad should also cancel her internship! On a moral clause that she used his daughter horribly to get a role and this shows her true character", "NTA. Unfortunately many people in older generations have antiquated ideas of hospitality. I\u2019m 41 and live and grew up in the south. I cannot tell you how often I\u2019ve had to bite my tongue and be kind due to \u201cmanners\u201d. I\u2019ve put up with abuse from family all to keep everyone happy. I finally grew into myself and cut those people out of my life. I\u2019ve never been happier. I\u2019ve also shown my 17 year old daughter that she doesn\u2019t have to put up with shit from people no matter what. Unfortunately your parents seem to still be in that don\u2019t rock the boat mindset.", "NTA.\n\nI was shocked when I checked your post history and saw that you were 21.  I understand parents can be oblivious when it comes to teenagers and writing everything off as 'teen drama.'\n\nBut by 21/22 they should trust you enough accept you're an adult who can choose who to spend time with.  It's definitely too old to be pressured into speaking to someone because you happen to be of a similar age at a gathering.\n\n From the way they have spoken to you they sound very headstrong. I'm sure they wouldn't put up with someone being rude to them. You have the right to disengage aswell.\n\nAlso, conversation works both ways. Sounds like your old friend didn't make much of an effort with you either. \n\nYour parents chose to put you in an awkward position, consciously or not, and the repercussions were it was awkward an embarrassed them a little Infront of their friends.  That's life.", "NTA, at all, in any way. You were polite but frosty, which takes some forbearance.\n\nI've always wanted the Southern sang-froid of my neighbor who full-on hated me (I was a Yankee) but could smile SO sweetly as she said \"Why bless your heart!\". Boy it kept me edgy. I never knew which hand held the verbal knife.\n\nI've never achieved it, though.", "I dont think u were in the wrong here no! She was the one who pushed too many boundaries", "NTA you said hello to her and that\u2019s as much as anyone should expect you to do. I\u2019m guessing maybe there weren\u2019t many other people there for her to interact with and if that\u2019s the case well that\u2019s the consequences of her own behaviour.", "NTA. I would guess they're just mad that you made *them* look bad in front of their friends and they didn't have the spine to tell them why you were ignoring their daughter despite knowing.\n\n> My parents said that since she was a guest I should have sucked it up and pretended to be her friend for the night.\n\nThey weren't *your* guest. They essentially are asking you to be nice to your bully, which is wrong of them.", "NTA you said hello to her and that\u2019s as much as anyone should expect you to do. I\u2019m guessing maybe there weren\u2019t many other people there for her to interact with and if that\u2019s the case well that\u2019s the consequences of her own behaviour.", "NTA. You said hello and didn't start a bitchfight, so nothing to blame you for. If your parents want to have someone talk to her, they should do it them selves.", "No way should you be forced to talk to her! Show your parents what she's done. Hopefully, they won't want you to be friends!", "That's a complicated one.  In my opinion, it really depends on your age and a bit more details.  Being that it sounds like you're probably in your 20s, I would say screw your parents and you are an adult and can make your own decisions on who to talk to and who not to talk to.  NTA.  I have a couple of caveats:\n\n1 If you are a kid, I would lean towards behaving in your parents house and just sucking up as they asked.  The career references seem to point that that is not the case.  As such, your parents really have no more say in the matter and you are not in the wrong to do as you wish.  You appear to have been very justified in your anger towards this person and owe them no courtesies.  Just realize that how you behave in public reflects not just on you but on your family.  It also can come back to bite you in the ass with unfortunate consequences that you do not expect.  Maybe you may need a favor in the future and this person appears to be very well connected and could assist you, etc.  If they know they have mistreated you that might even give them more encouragement to assist you in a time of need out of guilt, etc.  You never know.  It's never a bad idea to turn the other cheek and treat people nicely, even if they do not do the same.\n\n2 If this was a formal gathering and/or with many other people then I would encourage you to treat everyone kindly and hide any grievances.  Regardless of circumstances.\n\nCheers and good luck", "The girl has issues and none of that is your fault. The only \"bad\" thing is allowing this toxic woman to continue to be part of your life. Life is too short, tell your parents how you feel and why and they will support you.", "NTA. Civility is all that is required.", "NTA - My mom forced me to stay friends with my middle school bullies because she was friends with their moms. That\u2019s not even me inventing a reason because I\u2019m still salty (it was 15 years ago), she straight up told me that was the reason.\n\nIronically, it ended when she invited all of them/their parents over to our house for a Halloween party and forced me to come out of my room and entertain them (I hate holiday parties, always have, and fully intended on staying in my room the whole time).\n\nI was intentionally SUPER mean and generally a bad host to them the entire time, knowing that they wouldn\u2019t dare do anything to me in my own home with our parents around. Eventually they got fed up and each family left one by one. The next day, my mom yelled at me for \u201cruining the party\u201d and how their parents were all mad at her demanding that I apologize to them.\n\nI retorted that a) I didn\u2019t invite them, so they were her guests, not mine, b) her social life wasn\u2019t my responsibility, and c) I wasn\u2019t apologizing for getting back at them.\n\nReading your post was so cathartic.", "**N T A.**  \n\n\nAlso your parents are horrible.", "She wasn\u2019t *your* guest, she was theirs. Shame on your parents for even inviting her in the first place, knowing she bullied you.
