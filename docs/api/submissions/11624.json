It\u2019s great you wanna help them but it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of your future. \u201cParents, I love you but I cannot provide for you in this way. I need to focus on saving money for my future\u201d. \n\nIf they are disabled or too old to make money, maybe offer to help pay for a retirement home? (Not that it\u2019s cheap). Or offer to help them find work. \n\nThey brought you into the world and it\u2019s messed up to demand money from you. I\u2019d set a limit of how much support you can reasonably afford and tell them you want a connection with them outside of money- so you can help in a, b or c ways but your not a bank. \n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t tell them the \u201climit\u201d. I would honestly transfer money to them once a month (not a huge amount) and say- this is all I can do and if you bring up money again I won\u2019t be considering it. Like hang up the phone. Or just create a account for them you put in a small amount into and tell them that\u2019s all you can assist with. \n\nThe going blind comment feels manipulative.", "NTA.\n\nI'm going to make some guesses on your life based on what you described.  From what it sounds like, you moved to a wealthier country while your parents are living in a poorer one.  It sounds like you got a job with a lot higher wages than they would get at home.  However you also mentioned working shifts so it sounds like your job is still not the best paying job in the world.  Your parents sound like they are in a difficult spot while you also are in a difficult spot.  This is a tough situation all around. It's not your fault and it's not their fault, but it's creating tension.\n\nYour parents have every right to ask you for money, but you have every right to say no.  They have no right to demand it or try to guilt-trip you for not sending as much as they want.  Yes it sounds like they aren't in the best situation, but they are adults at the end of the day, and you can't put your own life on hold just to help them manage things that are their responsibility.", "NTA. Now, you want to save a house but, you can t let your dad be blind yk? imo your mom just exageretes(sorry if the word isn t correct). NTA imo", "NTA your mother has lied several times as to what she wants the money actually for. Cut them off, and go no contact if you need to.", "NTA be firm. You should have a better life and your mother should be appreciative of what you do send. Keep your money and buy your home.", "NTA. Are your parents in the uk? If so, they have the option of the NHS, so why would they need money for treatment?", "NTA. Children are not obligated to support their parents financially. It is the other way round, until the children are adults, of course.", "NTA and stop sending her anything.", "OP I'm so sorry that your parents (especially Mom) manipulates you for money. From what you've mentioned, your Mom can't budget and administer her finances. \n\nIs there another sibling local to your parents that could assist with finding out what is truly going on with your dad's health and their financial situation?\n\nCould you and your brother come up with a plan where your allocate a set amount of money to share with your parents each month or to set aside in savings for verified medical bills? \n\nIt's honorable that you want to help your parents within your abilities. Unfortunately, you parents have a very limited perspective on the expenses associated with living in the UK.\n\nMight I recommend a financial course or book for you and your brother such as one by Dave Ramsey? www.ramseysolutions.com\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sorry that your parents don't understand how hard you're trying and what hard work nursing is, especially in the UK.
