I was common law partners with one of these people and attempted a semi successful years long practise to teach to get better at it- he did get slightly better with gifts for our child over the years, although part of that may have been him realizing he suks at gifts letting his new partner help him. \n\nSomeone who sucks at gift giving should be given a list of possible things to buy, and a scope of the cost (look i'm probably spending about $100 on gifts for you). But also sometimes you need to reframe your expectations if you are in a relationship with a bad gift giver that is otherwise good, dial down your gifts to them and get yourself something nice that you want. Open communication would help with this if possible, but if you don't feel like you can talk about it you can wait until next october or november to set expectations for a new gift regime for the next holiday season, where you have a specific list and a price/scope.

It's a no brainer and often bought on the way to my house. So in a way it's thoughtful, to a point. Like 10 years in a row though. And frankly all scotch is not scotch I'd buy. \n\n\nOne year one family member knowing that I enjoy painting bought me a brush set. It was a good brush set, they went and talked to the art shop, got sneaky about asking me what paints I used for a painting, went back to the art shop and confirmed stuff. \n\n\nIt's the thought.", "Lol you're the worst troll ever.", "Are\u2026 are you the wife?! Lol", "Ah, I missed that! Just saw that he received a tie, didn\u2019t see where it was coated. My bad.", "Ahh, you are right. Wilma did save up money to buy Fred a bowling ball. As I recall, Fred found the money and bought himself a bowling ball. Wilma reported the money stolen, and hilarity ensued.", "I can\u2019t tell you how much I hate the \u201cpeople want to see you open it\u201d argument. I\u2019ve had that one lodged against me and I\u2019m like, is this about you or the recipient?", "A gift? Did you read? Commenter says she was gifted multiple large items she requested to be sent to her because the baby shower was 500 miles away from home. The giftS barely fit into her small car and she had to drive 8 hours pregnant barely being able to see out of her mirrors to get the giftS home. Her family put her in a dangerous position while pregnant. So, yeah I would\u2019ve told them all to send them to me. And if you want to take it back, fine, at least I\u2019m driving home with my unborn baby and making it back in one piece.", "A gift you have to spend money to receive is not a gift.", "There is a fine line between the two.\n\nLike your extended family, mine will buy things for me that is stuff they like or prefer. The thought is there but it also leaves a person feeling as though they aren't really seen or listened to when talking about things they personally love after constantly getting gifts that relate to others, not the person being gifted.\n\nMy sister two years ago gave me almost $100 in makeup and hair products. I don't use makeup or fancy hair products. It was thoughtful of her but useless at the same time as it'd never be used. Which is the entire reason why my family makes lists to give ideas on what kind of presents to buy.", "im dead serious. it\u2019s clear what type of people yall really are", "I\u2019ve never understood this. I cannot describe how much I don\u2019t want to watch someone open baby items, especially when going off a registry. The only way I\u2019m even slightly interested is if it\u2019s something super unique that I know they\u2019re going to be over the moon about.", "I don\u2019t see the relevance of being pregnant and driving. She would have to drive home anyway", "Then don\u2019t have a shower 500 miles from home.", "Unlike you, they're people with wirking brains.", "My friend lives 10,000 miles from her family and came back to her hometown for her shower. Since everyone actually grasped she had to fly, most gifts were ordered from stores in her country and shipped. \n\nIt is the only baby shower I have ever been to that wasn't just a miserable experience.", "Lord have mercy.\n\nShe can't see out of her mirror, which endangers herself and her unborn child. Also, she's pregnant with a giant belly trying to squish between the seat and steering wheel, seat pulled up to fit everything in the back.", "Are you intentionally being obtuse?"]}
