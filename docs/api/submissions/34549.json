TBH I would have been hoping for a little more than a tie in any colour!\n\nEdit: And just read in another post she got you a CD of someone you don't like.\n\nSo a tie and a CD you didn't want, does your wife actually like you?", "To be clear, your wife bought you a black tie (a tie, not a tux) and a CD of an artist she knows you don\u2019t like.

You bought your wife gifts she would want. She got you a single black tie and a CD for an artist she knows you don't even like. It doesn't seem like she put much effort into her gifts. \n\nThat being said, you're 40. You need to ensure you have proper funeral attire.", "NTA, the gifts she got you sucked a black tie for funerals and a CD for someone you don\u2019t like shows no thought whatsoever from her when you got her the perfume she liked and other things she liked as well.", "NTA\n\nUngrateful? Who would be grateful for a reminder of a funeral and a CD of an artist they don't like...? Tbh it is lowkey insensitive of her to do thaty and I struggle to believe the CD was unintentional given you told her you don't like the artist...", "NTA even putting aside the cd, she not only got you the most basic \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything to get a man\u201d gift ever, in the most basic color ever, but it was also related to a funeral you attended only a month ago when you may still be grieving that loss. Either she really doesn\u2019t like you or she\u2019s the most obvious person ever, and judging by her reaction to your remark, I\u2019m gonna go for the former.", "NTA it's a difficult conversation you need to have with your wife. I had to have it with mine recently as all the presents she bought me were ones for the family and never for me.\nI'd buy things that she had liked or mentioned throughout the year and I felt so sad.\nIt was a difficult conversation that you need to be tackful about and I'd suggest waiting a month or two to let things settle first. Depends on how she reacts will determine your next move.", "NTA. Who the hell buys someone funeral wear for Christmas? Sure you went to a funeral. In Novemeber. This was a bizarre and morbid choice for a Christmas gift.", "I mean you can wear a black tie without a funeral\u2026 but still NTA", "NTA.

You don't have to like it to say thank you.", "NAH \nI guess your wife just noticed you needed a black tie and decided to get you one. Given your answers to some other comments about a CD of a singer you didn't like, and that she gave you, I suppose she just didn't know what to get you. Maybe you have to make yourself more clear about what you would like to receive for Christmas. \nIt was quite unsensitive to tell her things out of the blue, but if you insist upon the fact that it was the thought of the funeral that made you sad, not the gift in itself, she could understand. When you wear it on the day you have to, thank her again.", "Black ties can be for events besides funerals", "Yta", "YTA as a black tie is not a \u201cfuneral tie\u201d.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
