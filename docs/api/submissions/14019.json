We said we would think it over. We talked and checked if it was even possible financially and everything was going in our favor for it. We became excited. After a few days my sister (let's call her Talia) well Talia pulls me to the side and begins talking to me about how although getting pregnant would be exciting, right now was bad timing for everyone and began trying to convince me how it would be better to wait for everyone's sake and I was confused at where it was all coming from Talia then went on to explain how she herself will be waiting for various reasons. She then brought up how I had complications last time and the healing period. She brought up very good points so I agreed to bring it up with my husband before talking to my mom.\n\nWell my husband agreed it would be difficult but said it was my decision at the end of the day. After a few days of thinking it over I agreed with her and talked to her and said I was fine with her plan of us both waiting a few months. I then spoke with my mother and although she was sad that I wouldn't be jumping in right away she agreed with the reasons and was just happy we would eventually have another baby.\ntwo week later...\n\nTalia walks in with a big smile \"I'm pregnant\" she exclaimed and although my parents were excited and happy for her, I stayed silent \"I didn't think we would get news so soon you've only been trying for a month\" my mom exclaimed, I stayed silent. My husband noticed and ushered us into my daughter's room, I cried.\n\nThe next day I asked talia what happened she smiled and said \"It's ok for me because I'm fine the next day but your so much work so no one wants to help me with my kids. At least this way they won't be busy with you.\" , \"but you said we should both wait and that you were waiting\" I said confused \"yeah but you know my boyfriend dosnt like to use protection and I really want to have his daughter\" Talia said. I explained a girl wasn't guaranteed but she just said she would keep trying till she got a girl with him and I got angry \"so when am I gonna be allowed to have a kid. You have 3 already\" I yelled \"its not my fault you need so much help after having a kid why don't you wait till you can hire a nanny\" she said annoyed and I glared at her because she knows we can't afford one. I left and stopped speaking with her.\n\nA few days later my mom came to me angrily and asked me why i had not been excited about the baby and why I couldn't just be happy for Talia. Am I the a/hole?\n\nEdit 1: I took the input of the people around me because they are the people who I had hoped would be helping me during my recovery but that will not be a possibility now. My mother had mainly convinced me by saying her and Talia would help while I recovered but now that Talia is pregnant they won't be able to.\n\nUpdate 1: \nWhile reading the comments here and responding I have also been silently listening to talia freak out because my parents refuse to throw her ANOTHER baby shower. She has complained that mine for my daughter was better and my parents are trying to explain that they were more financially well off at that time but when she had her first child they weren't that well off. Not to say hers was bad either.\n\n She had a rented room all her friends 5 other girls her age and my parents tried to get her brand new stroller and car seat and playpen her friends who were fresh out of highschool could only afford things like blankets and diapers. But my mom and I had worked for a long time to decorate and bake and make it a great baby shower.\n\nMy baby shower/gender reveal was during covid so I didn't have many people and my parents had invited a friend all my gifts were hand me downs not that I'm complaining I was in tears because I didn't even think I was going to have one, my dad was feeling better that day and he made steaks for dinner we did it in the backyard and it was a happy day for us.\n\nAnyways my parents have stated that they won't be doing it again because a baby shower is only for the first baby but they will hold another gender reveal party but not to expect lavish gifts. She is furious and is throwing aggression our way in the form of whispered curses and glares, my husband and I are ignoring her.\n\nUpdate 2: we had a place of our own when I was pregnant with my daughter we were safe financially but with the move to my parents place we lost our place and had to restart in a city an hour away from our previous jobs, we recently got back on our feet financially and are saving up for our own place which would have been near by for support but after this incident we are considering moving closer to his work and putting our baby making on hold till we have the money to pay for more after birth support.", "created_utc": 1680654042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c23hz/aita_bad_reaction_to_sisters_pregnancy/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
