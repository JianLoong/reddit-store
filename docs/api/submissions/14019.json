We said we would think it over. We talked and checked if it was even possible financially and everything was going in our favor for it. We became excited. After a few days my sister (let's call her Talia) well Talia pulls me to the side and begins talking to me about how although getting pregnant would be exciting, right now was bad timing for everyone and began trying to convince me how it would be better to wait for everyone's sake and I was confused at where it was all coming from Talia then went on to explain how she herself will be waiting for various reasons. She then brought up how I had complications last time and the healing period. She brought up very good points so I agreed to bring it up with my husband before talking to my mom.\n\nWell my husband agreed it would be difficult but said it was my decision at the end of the day. After a few days of thinking it over I agreed with her and talked to her and said I was fine with her plan of us both waiting a few months. I then spoke with my mother and although she was sad that I wouldn't be jumping in right away she agreed with the reasons and was just happy we would eventually have another baby.\ntwo week later...\n\nTalia walks in with a big smile \"I'm pregnant\" she exclaimed and although my parents were excited and happy for her, I stayed silent \"I didn't think we would get news so soon you've only been trying for a month\" my mom exclaimed, I stayed silent. My husband noticed and ushered us into my daughter's room, I cried.\n\nThe next day I asked talia what happened she smiled and said \"It's ok for me because I'm fine the next day but your so much work so no one wants to help me with my kids. At least this way they won't be busy with you.\" , \"but you said we should both wait and that you were waiting\" I said confused \"yeah but you know my boyfriend dosnt like to use protection and I really want to have his daughter\" Talia said. I explained a girl wasn't guaranteed but she just said she would keep trying till she got a girl with him and I got angry \"so when am I gonna be allowed to have a kid. You have 3 already\" I yelled \"its not my fault you need so much help after having a kid why don't you wait till you can hire a nanny\" she said annoyed and I glared at her because she knows we can't afford one. I left and stopped speaking with her.\n\nA few days later my mom came to me angrily and asked me why i had not been excited about the baby and why I couldn't just be happy for Talia. Am I the a/hole?\n\nEdit 1: I took the input of the people around me because they are the people who I had hoped would be helping me during my recovery but that will not be a possibility now. My mother had mainly convinced me by saying her and Talia would help while I recovered but now that Talia is pregnant they won't be able to.\n\nUpdate 1: \nWhile reading the comments here and responding I have also been silently listening to talia freak out because my parents refuse to throw her ANOTHER baby shower. She has complained that mine for my daughter was better and my parents are trying to explain that they were more financially well off at that time but when she had her first child they weren't that well off. Not to say hers was bad either.\n\n She had a rented room all her friends 5 other girls her age and my parents tried to get her brand new stroller and car seat and playpen her friends who were fresh out of highschool could only afford things like blankets and diapers. But my mom and I had worked for a long time to decorate and bake and make it a great baby shower.\n\nMy baby shower/gender reveal was during covid so I didn't have many people and my parents had invited a friend all my gifts were hand me downs not that I'm complaining I was in tears because I didn't even think I was going to have one, my dad was feeling better that day and he made steaks for dinner we did it in the backyard and it was a happy day for us.\n\nAnyways my parents have stated that they won't be doing it again because a baby shower is only for the first baby but they will hold another gender reveal party but not to expect lavish gifts. She is furious and is throwing aggression our way in the form of whispered curses and glares, my husband and I are ignoring her.\n\nUpdate 2: we had a place of our own when I was pregnant with my daughter we were safe financially but with the move to my parents place we lost our place and had to restart in a city an hour away from our previous jobs, we recently got back on our feet financially and are saving up for our own place which would have been near by for support but after this incident we are considering moving closer to his work and putting our baby making on hold till we have the money to pay for more after birth support.", "created_utc": 1680654042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c23hz/aita_bad_reaction_to_sisters_pregnancy/", "score": 911, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I\u2019d had a difficult birth and someone who was lucky to not have that rubbed it in my face\u2026I would have lose my shit on them. Have a bit of self respect.", "This all sounds very Latino drama and exhausting. Coming from another latina, ESH.", "Are you from South Asia? Did u see this story on a daily soap wtf", "Why would your sister need help?  She herself said she's fine the day after giving birth.  If she and her partner can't cope with that many kids then they shouldn't keep having them.\n\nAlso, are you certain you would go through the some things this time (is it a medical condition you have?)?  Reason I'm saying this is I was bedridden for a couple of months after having my son yet I was fine after having my daughter.", "Why can\u2019t Talia just hire a nanny if she needs so much help?\n\nOP, do not have more kids while you are still dependent in any way on your family. Tell your mother she can invest all her time and energy in raising Talia\u2019s kids, and as she has explained she can\u2019t be there if you need her, you and your husband will figure something out.", "It could be a different family dynamic in another country. My husband for example is Turkish and the families are extremely embedded with each other. If someone for example is sick in bed they would all take care of that person. Honestly if they\u2019re Turkish this would make a lot of sense, Turks have to have at least two kids. The consensus is over there that every child HAS to have a sibling, and being sick in bed six months wouldn\u2019t get you out of that.", "OP, please listen to this comment.", "just because they used to be the norm and still are in some parts of the world, doesnt mean its okay to have children and adults share a room or alot of kids in one room. kids need space to grow and having them in the same room isnt healthy, judging by OP - its a small space for AT LEAST 3 kids and 5 adults so far.", "I was looking for this comment. I knew it wasn't just me. I've never seen someone write a aita post like this. Absolutely bonkers.\n\nEsh imo, if this isn't some weird romcom fanfic I'm not recognizing. Mom sucks for pushing for grandkids during a time when it's not a good idea for either of her daughters, sister sucks for basically everything about her, and op sucks because she's being so back and forth about a very serious decision where realistically she isn't in the best position right now anyway, but she was fine with waiting for her own reasons until she.. what was it... glared silently or something idk. And then she met the alpha, and he was a jerk. The end.", "lol is this a group home they all live in? \ud83d\ude02", "From the sound of it, sister\u2019s current partner is a more recent one and not the father of her previous children (she has a 3yo daughter but apparently it\u2019s not his because she \u201cwants to have her boyfriend\u2019s daughter\u201d). So it\u2019s just sister popping out kids like a pez dispenser.", "Everyone sucks here.", "What does ESH mean?", "Not cool to put disabilities and assholes in the same category. No one chooses to be disabled.", "You were bedridden for 6 months after your last child and your mother is pushing you to have another because she wants a 5th/6th grandchild?\n\nShe\u2019s the sick one.", "Your mother and Talia sound like they are cut from the same lying, manipulative cloth.\n\nYou can keep the peace and GET AWAY from them at the same time.", "Well then, there's multiple fathers (father's families) to assist with looking after the other children.\n\nYou've totally put me off pez now though \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\ud83c\udfaf", "Imagine asking your daughter to risk her life for another grandchild?!", "Imagine asking for a grandchild in the first place.", "But all her friends have one so she needs a grandchild too /s", "Yeah, the whole concept of expecting someone to go through pregnancy and childbirth is bizarre.", "She has 4 already."]}
