Not sick days? Is this something that I am too non-American to understand?", "NTA\n\nI'd be telling her,\n\"If i do this will you take care of me and pay my bills during my surgery?\"\n Like yeah it sucks but this girl will have other dance recitals.", "NTA, but maybe ask the daughter to do a solo performance of her dance routine for you when you see her again, and send a card with her mom to give her after the recital. When I was a kid, my dad traveled a lot for work and missed a lot of my dance recitals etc, but knowing he was thinking about it and didn't forget was almost as good as having him there.", "NTA \n\n\nIs your girlfriend supportive of your surgery and how you've been worried about it at all?\n\n\nTell the daughter you're excited for her, wish you could be there, but you have to work. As someone else said, you can buy her flowers and ask to see her practice in the living room. Definitely tell her that you want to watch a recording of it and watch it with her.", "NTA  10 hrs of PTO IS a big deal, when you already need it for health reasons. No reason you can't bring the girl flowers later and tell her that you heard what a good job she did.", "NTA. Send her flowers and say you\u2019re sorry you can\u2019t make it. But don\u2019t use PTO for it; even if you had it to spare. 5yo dance recitals are excruciating.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is being ridiculous. Instead of guilt tripping you, she should be asking how she can support you during your upcoming surgeries.", "NTA. Your health is important. Explain the situation to her daughter. It's important to understand that sometime adults have circumstances of their own.", "You are NTA. Your gf should be more understanding knowing that you have these surgeries scheduled, and she should be helping her daughter understand. Gf\u2019s dismissive attitude is baffling. It almost seems like this is some kind of test for you to prove how important her daughter is to you. I hope you all come up with a positive resolution. \n\nBTW, having sat through many of my niece\u2019s recitals and plays, I know they almost always have a table in the lobby for parents to buy flowers. Perhaps you can give gf money to buy a bouquet from you, or you could purchase some yourself earlier in the day and ask her to bring them for you.", "NTA totally understand both sides. Really hard to be a judge here. But I wouldn't consider you the asshole if it's not always you choose the work over her. And when the situation is better, you'd be able to compensate to her.", "NTA. but it is complicated. since you already made your decision, i would suggest you gift her something she likes.", "NTA sounds like you'd go if the schedule or life circumstances allowed. Find out if they're recording the recital and make plans to watch it with the kid.", "Nta !!", "NTA. \n\nTaking a vacation day for your girlfriends kids recital?  No.  You are calling it PTO, so I assume you are in the US.  Our vacation/PTO is already bad enough.  Why waste a day on this.  Especially if you have surgery coming up where you will NEED those days for recovery. \n\nYour gf is being super manipulative here.", "INFO why would it take 10 hours to see the performance??", "NTA. Adulting sucks sometimes, especially if you have unusual work hours. \n\nPTO should be used for illness, surgery, funerals, mental health days etc. Not to see 5 year olds dance. It is unreasonable for your gf to ask this of you, knowing you will need the paid time off for your health. \n\nI like the idea of gf or someone recording it, and you watching it with her later. Get her some roses for after the recital.", "NTA\n\nTell me you live in the US, without telling me you live in the US", "NAH -  Easy to see both sides of this, personally though if you could I'd take the time off and go.

Ten hours is a LOT. \n\nI like some of the suggestions others have in terms of making the little girl feel special and helping her understand the situation.\n\nAlso, talk with gf again about how long it takes to accrue pto, and how you'll need every bit of it when you have your surgeries.\n\nThis is such an unreasonable request.", "NTA. Does your girlfriend know that youre having these surgeries? IF so shes a huge AH for trying to insist you use your precious time for her daughters recital. Shes 5 and likely wont remember that you werent there by the time shes like 7. Her mom should use this as a teachable moment about how our health is important and sometimes you have to miss fun things to take care of yourself. But they want OP healthy right. This should be a fairly easy convo to have with her kid.", "NTA\n\nYou have two surgeries upcoming and will need the time then. \n\nCan you get her a rose or something after the recital and ask for a super special private performance from child?", "YTA", "Tough choice. I can tell you now there are no winners. But if your company has some incredibly horrible practices that make you take personal time for medical necessities as you say, your hands are tied.", "She's 5. Send her flowers with a big lollipop and she'll be glad you missed it.  I'm guessing she only has one or 2 numbers so at most 7 minutes on stage. \n\nThere will also a video that can be purchased that you can make a big deal about viewing.  \n\nSometimes there are are rehearsals that you could attend to see her dance as well. \n\nWhat I think is actually happening here is the mom wants you there to support her. Is her ex going to be there? Does he have a girlfriend? Does she have no one else to go with?", "Nta", "NTA but you might want to rethink your relationship if you are not willing to take time out of your life for her daughter. Fathers take time to watch their kids at things.", "We used to have separate vacation days and sick days, but our union agreed to combine them as PTO time in exchange for some concessions from the county.", "Many workplaces have combined sick days, holidays, and vacation time and call it PTO. You can allocate the days however you want, mostly.", "Ha, probably. \n\nMany companies (mine included) don't separate sick and vacation time.  So you have one bucket of PTO.  If you never get sick, it can be great.  If something like a surgery happens, it sucks.", "So typically you would get a limited amount of paid time off, but it sounds like OP\u2019s surgery recovery will go over that set amount so he will have to use vacation days as well", "They could make it a big thing too at home which the daughter will love, make the room or garden look all fancy, throw up loads of string lights, he and girlfriend dress up to the nines so it's like she's performing in some fancy theatre, throw flowers on the \"stage\" and yell encore whilst clapping.\n\nAll attention would be on her there, no way she wouldn't love that.", "Ohhh yes. OP, get her a really nice bouquet and ask her mother to hand it to her after the recital and take a picture of her holding it. She will feel really special and grown up and you can get a print of the picture to hang up in your house in an area where everyone will see it frequently.\n\nYou can show her how proud you are without compromising your surgery.", "But he isn't her father, step father, or even soon to be step father.  He is dating her mother.  \n\nAlso, he has a damn surgery coming up.  If he was like \"I want to save this time up so I can watch football all day\", I'd agree.  But even parents have to prioritize things.", "I would say it's more OP might want to rethink his relationship if his SO is incapable of understanding that OP only gets limited PTO time, and is expecting him to use it for this when she knows he has multiple surgeries coming up that he'll need those days for.", "I just got back to work after 4 weeks of sick leave and it's so wild to me how you wouldn't be able to get whatever sick leave is required by health professionals. Regardless, NTA", "NTA but check into state disability for days not covered by your PTO. You might receive partial pay while you are recuperating.", "This is becoming the US norm to have combined PTO days vs sick days and vacation.  When they make the switch the  company typically adds a few extra PTO days to the usual vacation for the sick time. It is good for people who are rarely sick or people that have little germ bug kids as you cannot use sick days for family.  \n\nThe bad side of this is that sick people won\u2019t take off as they have planned for the full PTO days.  One coworker went to the doctor over lunch and tested positive for flu.  But she came back into work as she didn\u2019t want to take the day off!!", "He would likely still have to use all the PTO he has for that. Typically short term disability will only kick in after PTO is used up, even then it takes weeks for the payments to start.", "You are correct with that. I was just hoping to help him after pto was used. He is definitely NTA for trying to save his allocated time."]}
