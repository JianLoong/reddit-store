I hope you all come up with a positive resolution. \n\nBTW, having sat through many of my niece\u2019s recitals and plays, I know they almost always have a table in the lobby for parents to buy flowers. Perhaps you can give gf money to buy a bouquet from you, or you could purchase some yourself earlier in the day and ask her to bring them for you.", "NTA totally understand both sides.

Ten hours is a LOT. \n\nI like some of the suggestions others have in terms of making the little girl feel special and helping her understand the situation.\n\nAlso, talk with gf again about how long it takes to accrue pto, and how you'll need every bit of it when you have your surgeries.\n\nThis is such an unreasonable request.", "NTA. Does your girlfriend know that youre having these surgeries? IF so shes a huge AH for trying to insist you use your precious time for her daughters recital. Shes 5 and likely wont remember that you werent there by the time shes like 7. Her mom should use this as a teachable moment about how our health is important and sometimes you have to miss fun things to take care of yourself. But they want OP healthy right. This should be a fairly easy convo to have with her kid.", "NTA\n\nYou have two surgeries upcoming and will need the time then. \n\nCan you get her a rose or something after the recital and ask for a super special private performance from child?", "YTA", "Tough choice.

Send her flowers with a big lollipop and she'll be glad you missed it.  I'm guessing she only has one or 2 numbers so at most 7 minutes on stage. \n\nThere will also a video that can be purchased that you can make a big deal about viewing.  \n\nSometimes there are are rehearsals that you could attend to see her dance as well. \n\nWhat I think is actually happening here is the mom wants you there to support her. Is her ex going to be there? Does he have a girlfriend? Does she have no one else to go with?", "Nta", "NTA but you might want to rethink your relationship if you are not willing to take time out of your life for her daughter.

You can allocate the days however you want, mostly.", "Ha, probably. \n\nMany companies (mine included) don't separate sick and vacation time.  So you have one bucket of PTO.  If you never get sick, it can be great.  If something like a surgery happens, it sucks.", "So typically you would get a limited amount of paid time off, but it sounds like OP\u2019s surgery recovery will go over that set amount so he will have to use vacation days as well", "They could make it a big thing too at home which the daughter will love, make the room or garden look all fancy, throw up loads of string lights, he and girlfriend dress up to the nines so it's like she's performing in some fancy theatre, throw flowers on the \"stage\" and yell encore whilst clapping.\n\nAll attention would be on her there, no way she wouldn't love that.", "Ohhh yes. OP, get her a really nice bouquet and ask her mother to hand it to her after the recital and take a picture of her holding it. She will feel really special and grown up and you can get a print of the picture to hang up in your house in an area where everyone will see it frequently.\n\nYou can show her how proud you are without compromising your surgery.", "But he isn't her father, step father, or even soon to be step father.  He is dating her mother.  \n\nAlso, he has a damn surgery coming up.  If he was like \"I want to save this time up so I can watch football all day\", I'd agree.  But even parents have to prioritize things.", "I would say it's more OP might want to rethink his relationship if his SO is incapable of understanding that OP only gets limited PTO time, and is expecting him to use it for this when she knows he has multiple surgeries coming up that he'll need those days for.", "I just got back to work after 4 weeks of sick leave and it's so wild to me how you wouldn't be able to get whatever sick leave is required by health professionals. Regardless, NTA", "NTA but check into state disability for days not covered by your PTO. You might receive partial pay while you are recuperating.", "This is becoming the US norm to have combined PTO days vs sick days and vacation.  When they make the switch the  company typically adds a few extra PTO days to the usual vacation for the sick time. It is good for people who are rarely sick or people that have little germ bug kids as you cannot use sick days for family.  \n\nThe bad side of this is that sick people won\u2019t take off as they have planned for the full PTO days.  One coworker went to the doctor over lunch and tested positive for flu.  But she came back into work as she didn\u2019t want to take the day off!!", "He would likely still have to use all the PTO he has for that. Typically short term disability will only kick in after PTO is used up, even then it takes weeks for the payments to start.", "You are correct with that. I was just hoping to help him after pto was used. He is definitely NTA for trying to save his allocated time.", "NTA.  Taking 10 hours of PTO to watch a 1 hour recital?  Oh. Hell. No.  Not when you know you will need that PTO for your upcoming surgeries.  Tell GF to film the recital and then you and daughter can watch it together.", "SHE'S AN IDIOT GET RID OF HER", "NTA", "NTA.  Might need to have an additional surgery and cut out that GF.  She is being unreasonable.  It's a 5-year old's recital.  The only one who ever cares about something like that is the parent.  While I'm sure you'd like to be there, it is crazy to take time off work to do so - especially with your surgeries coming up that are going to eat up all your time. If she's too self-centered to think this through then you may need to rethink the relationship.", "NTA but I\u2019m curious why you\u2019d have to take 10 hours off for a recital? Wouldn\u2019t it require a couple of hours of PTO at most?  Or is she just asking you take the entire day off?", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend can FaceTime you into the recital.", "NTA", "This. Also ask gf to film the dances if she can and have a big bouquet waiting at home to give her after the recital. Watch the video with her and give compliments", "Most US companies have Paid Time Off (PTO) and you use them for both sick time and vacation.", "Yes. I only get PTO, you use it for any time off. There's no separate sick leave.", "If they are like my job, it is required to be manned by a certain number of people per shift for safe operations. Since they then have to call someone out on overtime, and union contract specifies minimum number of hours to be paid, then you can\u2019t take just a few hours out of a shift. You have to take entire shift. \n\nNot saying that\u2019s the case here, but it\u2019s a possibility that taking a few hours is difficult.", "How it works here (Netherlands) is that I have some 6 weeks of vacation days in a year. Those 6 weeks are a combination of mandatory days off (Christmas, Eastern and such) and vacation days I can plan to my convenience. \n\nWhen I am sick, I'm sick: I do not go to work and get paid anyway. If I get sick during my holidays, my vacation days are given back. I'm leaving out some details but that is the gist of it.", "With people who are sick often it does not make much of a difference. If you get 2 weeks of sick time and 2 weeks of vacation, a person that get sick will often still have to 3 weeks of time off due to being sick, two weeks of sick time and one week of vacation time, or end up using all 2 weeks of sick and 2 weeks of vacation time for their illness. \n\nIt really isn't that different than having just one big 4 week bucket of PTO. \n\nBut for people who don't get sick as often, be able to use 3 weeks or even 4 weeks as vacation is a nice benefit, versus only having 2 weeks of vacation and having 2 weeks of unused sick time every year.", "In Maryland you can use vacation or sick days for family. And as long as you use an earned vacation or sick day it's protected", "It depends on the policy\u2019s waiting period. The company would most likely have him use any accrued time off during that waiting period. If there\u2019s a state plan in place, they most likely can\u2019t force him to take company provided benefits before applying. However they can have them use it during the state plan\u2019s waiting period (usually around 7 days).", "Usually the first week is either unpaid or PTO. Disability kicks in after a week or so.", "NAH\n\nI think you should do something special with the little girl the day before. Like, can you have a fancy tea party? Can you surprise her with a giant bouquet when she wakes up? Also, request it be filmed and then *watch the film with her*, while lamenting you couldn't go. It doesn't count if she doesn't see you doing it. \n\nI'm also wondering why it has to be 10 hours. You can't take just 2? Pop out, watch the show, and then take off again, like you'd have to do if you were going to the dentist? Or a half day? \n\nThis WILL have repercussions which will echo down the full length of this little girls life, so proceed with caution and sensitivity. It's a pretty big deal when a small child decides to honor a grown up with an invitation.", "NTA - And you should reconsider this relationship.  Your gf is saying that her daughter's dance thing is more important than your health.  You really want to be with someone who thinks so little of you?\n\nPlus she's one of those parents who refuses to ever tell her child 'no' regardless of who it hurts.  She's going to raise her to be extremely entitled and she's going to be a handful to deal with if she's not already.\n\nYou get one go around on this planet, you really want to spend your time with someone like that?  Personally, I'd want to be with someone who actually cared about me.", "NTA but idk man are you  ready to step in and be this girls father because it seems like that\u2019s what you GF is pushing", "NTA and your girlfriend should understand and be on your side, explain to her daughter that you'd love to be there but you can't. She can record the recital for you to all watch together later. You can buy flowers, etc. She's FIVE. Mom needs to step up and parent, help her to deal with the disappointment - we don't always get what we want.", "NTA.  She's a child, but her mom can explain it to her.  If these surgeries are life changing and important, your girlfriend should understand that.  I mean, yeah, you don't WANT to disappoint the kid, but.... that's life sometimes.  I would make it clear to the kid that you want to be there, and that you love her, and make plans for something special with just you and her another time.", "That\u2019s a huge leap to assume she\u2019s some crazy manipulator instead of wanting her boyfriend included in her family", "They could probably get FMLA but that's unpaid. You get the time off but if you don't have PTO you don't get paid.", "That's absolutely incomprehensible to an American. Any American. No one gets that kind of deal.", "Even medical leave is unpaid until your claim is processed, which is *after the leave is over.* \n\nCan you go two pay periods without a paycheck? As a typical American, I cannot.", "On top of that, many times when you're off on FMLA,  you can still be required to pay for your health insurance. My old manager was out with maternity leave for 6 weeks, and she had to pay $1300 to maintain her insurance during her leave.", "Can I ask how many paid leaves you typically get in a year? I am not from the US too and am curious", "We got incredibly lucky that I started a new job with affordable insurance when my wife went on leave. There's no way we could have paid 1/4 what we would have had to pay to keep my wife's insurance.", "NTA because your girlfriend isn't backing you on helping her daughter understand you can't make it. It's sweet that she wants you to go but unless your gf can cover the bills for your missed wages, you have to do what's best for you.", "NTA she\u2019s five she will get over it. You need to take care of your health, just tell the girlfriend that her daughter can get over it or I can get over you. Manipulation via child, kinda sh tty of your gf.", "NTA.", "YTA\n\nDude, just don't work that day.  Don't use the PTO.  As a dad you're going to have to sacrifice work sometimes in order to be present for your children.", "NTA Your time off sounds exceedingly precious and needs to be rationed carefully. Surgery and recovery from surgery takes precedence over everything else. A gf's 5 year old's dance recital is way way down the list and there will be many more. She is weaponizing her daughter to manipulate you. Your surgery and recovery should be important to her.", "NTA.  Why does it take ten hours of PTO to go to a recital?", "NTA\n\nThe daughter is 5.  She probably won't even remember the recital when she is older.  Your girlfriend is being an AH though.  The fact that she refuses to be understanding of your medical needs and feels her daughter's recital is more important than your health is a massive red flag.  If you give in on this, she will continue pushing her daughter's wants against your needs for the rest of the relationship.  You should rethink being with someone who cares so little about you.", "NTA \n\nYou need the time off for your surgeries, but just so you know, this sounds like a test to see if you will prioritise her and her daughter before work", "NTA. You can\u2019t help that you need surgery and will need all your PTO. Is there anyway your GF can record or livestream it so you can be there in spirit?", "That's a great idea", "I\u2019m American. My office jobs have given ten vacation days and five sick days per year. \n\nVacation days accumulate until they are used. Sick days reset to zero every January 1st. \n\nTherefore, I would have needed to use vacation days for surgery and recovery.", "The greatest country in the world, they say...", "NTA but America treatment to workers is.  I hope everything goes well with your surgery \ud83e\udd1e", "I only get 3 paid sick days a year and if I wanted to get paid for more days off, I would need to take it out of my PTO", "Flexible leave and schedule is a luxury my friend. I have it but I work a self contained salaried desk job. I can flex my schedule to avoid leave entirely, have separate sick and annual leave, and can take either in a little as 15 min increments. Many places don't allow for ANY of that. Have an appointment that's an hour and dead center of a shift? You take the whole ass day. My dad had a shift job. Worked nights for IBM and then Global Foundries. He missed MANY holidays because they were open and holiday leave was first requested, first approved. He only got half \"days\" if the line was mega slow and his bosses let him go. They would basically punch him out for him, no leave used. On nights he needed off, it was burning a \"day\" of leave. No hourly chunks.", "My place of employment is trying to do that and every employee is pitching a fit. What a bs plan.", "I was texting with a friend this morning who recently started with a new company. She doesn't get any sick or vacation days until January AND during her training period can't do WFH, so she was trying to figure out did she take the paycheck hit or go to work with what seemed to be the beginnings of a cold.\n\nAnd I admit it isn't a question I can relate to my office does the (unheard of in the states) unlimited sick time. You can't abuse it but if you have surgery (which is a doctor appt day- not sick time, that's different), you can take a few sick days after to recover. It removes a lot of the stress.\n\nYou still have to use PTO and FMLA if you need to be out for long periods. If say you had surgery and recovery would be several months, but sick leave can be used a surprising amount.", "Welcome the U.S.A. where the wants and desires of employers and insurance companies outweigh what a medical professional finds best.", "Really not the point.", "Wow, as an American that is hard for me to imagine.  And I'm glad you didn't mention maternity leave (we don't get that here - that's what PTO is for).", "[deleted]", "This is not true. Disability kicks in after 7 days, which you would need to use PTO or go unpaid.", "That's ... Not even remotely true. Do you mean sign up for a short term disability plan? If so, yes. But with FMLA you apply for it *after* you have a qualifying disability/condition. FMLA is job protection. If you want to be paid during FMLA you need a short term disability plan, PTO, or employer who provides maternity leave etc. \n\n Source: am a physician who fills out FMLA paperwork for my patients, and am also a mom who had to apply for FMLA while pregnant for when I had my baby.", "It varies wildly from job to job and state to state. I have worked a job where I had upwards of 3 months PTO on the books because time was gained by a percentage of hours worked each paycheck and carried over from year to year, one where I could only carry 9 days a year and had to remember to request they be cashed out if unused before the next year or lose the money completely. Currently working a job where I have zero.", "My job gives one paid sick day per month. If you use them up, you have the option of using vacation time to supplement, but I\u2019m not allowed to take unpaid time off unless I\u2019m totally out of both sick and vacation. \n\nFor FMLA, the kind of medical leave where you can take up to twelve weeks and they\u2019re not allowed to discipline you for it, you have to have a ton of paperwork filled out by your doctor and the maximum is twelve weeks in a given year.", "The key fact is that absolutely nothing is legally mandated. They don\u2019t have to give you even one paid day off no matter what happens. Healthcare typically comes your employer and they don\u2019t have to provide that either. Most people with paid time off of any type have four weeks or less. Like, that\u2019s not the average, four weeks is really quite good. So stretching just a few weeks PTO to cover recovery time from two surgeries would be a stretch for most people.", "The federal government doesn\u2019t mandate any time legally. There is FMLA which pretty much holds your job but is unpaid. There is no mandated vacation time either. It\u2019s job and sometimes state dependent.", "Maybe that\u2019s what I mean? My comment was based on advice given to me by coworkers who\u2019ve said they had to apply for FMLA and use it for maternity leave. I haven\u2019t had to do it on my own. Maybe they were conflating FMLA with paid family leave? Regardless I\u2019ll delete my comment. Thanks for the info!"]}
