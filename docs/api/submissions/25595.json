He kicked us out and sold our home in order to pay off his debts. As all this happened during covid, the money has been tight to say the least, but regardless we all share the burden and responsibilities of renting, bills, groceries and so on. \n\nOnto the story:\nI have recently found a lost puppy (Bella). I knew it was someones pup since she had a name tag and a phone number written on it. The number was unavailable so I spent half a day trying to track the owners down, and after a long search, I found them.\nBeautiful Bella was returned to the worried owners and I was super happy! The owners though were even more happy as the man shoved money into my hands as he thanked me. It was around 80-90$ (rough translation from my currency). I didn't have time to refuse him since the man bolted to his car before I could say anything. \nI can't lie and say that didn't make me happy as we are always tight on money...but I was just glad that Bella was reunited with her family.\n\nI decided to take half for myself in order to pay my bills and gave the other half to my family knowing we're out of some groceries.\n\nForward to later that same day, I opened the fridge to grab a snack. My mom saw this and the conversation went as followed:\n\nMom: what are you doing? Are you taking our food?\nMe: what? YOUR food? This is OUR fridge?\nMom: you said you plan to move out next year but keep taking our food! That's irresponsible! \nMe: I always eat my own food, (my brother and I have Hashimoto and buy our own food fitting our preference and needs) not to mention, if we're going by that logic you bought this with MY money didn't you?\nMom: that wasn't your money though!\nMe:...but then it's not yours either now is it?\n\nAn argument ensued and I got angry. I ended up saying that the next time something like this happens, I will simply not tell them about it and keep the money to myself if she's going to be like this. \nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693091324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1629r02/aita_for_saying_ill_keep_any_money_i_get_to/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mom shouldn't punish you for planning to move out in a YEAR!", "On top of that, you and your brother have the extra burden of buying your own food due to Hashimoto, a health condition. \n\nYour intent in writing this post is to get an outside perspective on whether you were wrong in the argument you had with your mom. You found a lost dog, returned it to its owner, and received a reward which you shared with your family. However, when you were confronted by your mom about taking 'their' food, an argument ensued. To avoid such situations in the future, you said you'll keep any money you find for yourself. Now, you'd like to know if you were the \"asshole\" for saying that. \nComing to the response to your situation, I don't think you are the asshole. Money is tight and it's only fair to divide any available extra income. Your act of kindness of returning the dog and then sharing your reward was very considerate. It seems there are some misunderstandings and tensions due to strained circumstances, and maybe some clear and calm communication can help sort this out. With that being said, everyone in your family is going through a tough time so try to show understanding, your mother might've been stressed as well.", "NTA, it\u2019s your money.

I don't agree with you arguing about whose money your mother's food was bought with.

I have no reason to believe she would not have dropped the issue once you were clear it was your food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
