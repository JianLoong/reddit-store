I'm now 34 and she's 17. \n\nLast week, she got outed at school and to make a bad situation worse, her dad was mad at her, said she was lying for attention, and when she said it was for real, called her a slur. \n\nShe came over my apartment distraught and looking for some advice, I'm a lesbian and have been out for years.\n\nI told her that I was so sorry that happened, that was shitty since she deserved to be able to decide who to tell and when. But she wasn't the only one outed.\n\nHer dad? He just outed himself as a bigot. He outed himself as someone who should have never become a parent if he wasn't ready to love and accept his own damn child. \n\nAnd her school administrators? Outed themselves as negligent, probably even in the legal sense.\n\nBut overall, when I come out, I often out other people wayyy harder than I out myself.  It can be hard, but it can also feel empowering, to take a torch to the darkness, light it for all to see, and burn it away. \n\nJust by being in the room, and letting people tell on themselves, we're outing bigots. So I let them talk, and then go tell whoever I damn well please. I let them become known as ignorant and bigoted, cause that's a hell of a lot worse than being known as queer.\n\nI told her it was horrible her story was taken from her, but I hoped she knew it isn't taken forever. It's her right to say as much or as little to whoever she wants. \n\nAnd if someone gossips? They don't know her heart, they're just revealing their own hatred and ugliness. So don't let it eat at you. So document and record it if you want. Share it if you want, or keep it just in case. But whatever you do, it's all your call. It always is. \n\nWe talked well into the night. And she was feeling way better afterwards, and ready to go home and face her dad again.\n\nWell, shortly after she went home, my mom called me. She said that my sis had come home and told her dad that they should \"agree to disagree\" about her sexuality, and anything further he had to say about it spoke only to his own character and said fuck-all about her. \n\nAnd when he tried to argue she took out her phone and started filming and saying \"Do tell... You had a fucking child and weren't ready to love it? Get a fuckin DOG if you want something that'll come back begging when you abuse it\" \n\nMy mom called me furious because she thought I'd coached her on what to say, which I genuinely hadn't. I told her what advice I had given, and she was angry I even said that much, and asked me if it would have killed me to say that I think her dad loves her and to give him some time to understand. I was irate to hear that honestly because... Like what she actually said was heartbreaking and it hurts to hear my mom and stepdad didn't listen one bit. \n\nAITA for the advice I gave?", "created_utc": 1675801889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wc99b/aita_for_the_advice_i_gave_my_younger_stepsister/", "score": 2900, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Spot fucking on in every sense of the world. And if you can and are comfortable please be ready to grab her from that toxic as hell household the nanosecond she turns 18 and can GTFO. \n\nCause sadly bigots like to bigot and I genuinely worry for her physical and mental health and safety.

The whole \"he just needs time\" doesn't work and often isn't true.\n\nI'm 29. I came out as bi at 16. Demi last year non-binary this year. He's never changed. Often bigots don't. So keep an eye on her and help her plan an escape. \n\nAnd I suggest her writing to the school board about what happened. Maybe a local fb post or two.

She's of my blood, she has to be straight, blah blah.\"", "Ohhh honestly the reasons I've recorded stuff and suggested she did too was... \n\n- to get in the habit of thoroughly documenting hate speech / discrimination, especially before she starts in academia or the workplace. Title 9 and HR become a lot easier to deal with when you come in with video, they can't play the \"he said she said\" game! \n\n- to provide some personal safety, since people tend to not escalate to vilence if there's gonna be evidence. Especially if you say you're live streaming and have an app that films to a remote backup. \n\n- to be believed if or when something needs to be reported to authorities. Police and many workplaces in our area have a pretty strong bias against queer people and will do fuck-all unless you give them a clear cut case of discrimination or hate crimes on a silver platter and make it clear you know the law and that they are legally required to address it. \n\nI don't ever mean it to be a petty thing, for me I just consider documentation a really vital safety tool and one of the only ones a minor can actually have since I can't exactly suggest she gets a weapon or something for when shit gets bad.

My husband & I are both bi. We were so fucked up in our youth by our respective parents being bigots. Thank god your sister has a voice of reason, an ally. I really hope she\u2019s ok & her parents are sense but I reckon if she\u2019s got you she\u2019s gonna be ok. \nKeep on lighting up that beacon Sis. \ud83d\udda4", "NTA. You\u2019re incredible and so is she, holy shit.", "NTA. I'm glad your sister has you in her corner.", "NTA. Your advice is beautiful and turns what I assume is the scariest part of coming out into a very empowering opportunity. Parents may need a moment to process, but it shouldn't be shrouded in hate and slurs. It should be for figuring out how to start supporting their child in a world still coming to terms with the fact that everyone is not the same.", "NTA\n\nYou gave some incredibly wise advice, and I hope you don\u2019t mind me stealing it if I ever have friends or family in that situation.\n\nYour mum and stepdad are unequivocally the AHs here. I expect their reactions will lead to you being the one who gets to meet any girls your sister brings home. You\u2019re a good egg, OP.", "NTA. Also tell your sister she's a fucking badass for that comeback", "NTA.\n\nShe is lucky to have your support.", "Great advice! You are NTA.", "NTA. The ages are different but my sister and I had this exact situation happen last week. I\u2019m also the older sibling. I\u2019m glad you stood up for her", "YTA to your mom especially your dads a dick and deserves to be ignored but your moms worse imo. Enablers are what keeps AH thriving", "NTA. That's some awesome advice. She will meet people who will want to attack her character and her body just because she dares to exist as her true self, she doesn't own anyone any apology. This is one of the most valuable things you could teach her.", "NTA! *Hugs for both of you*", "NTA. But be prepared for if/when they kick her out. You\u2019re the only person in her corner right now, she\u2019ll need all the advice she can get. Tell your sister a fellow queer sends her love and hope for an amazing future!", "NTA your sister was 100% correct to stand up for herself and everything she said was hard facts. Good for you and good for her.", "NTA but both you and your step-sister sound amazing.", "NTA\n\nIt is very damaging to insist to children that their parent \u2018loves them\u2019 when the parent says hurtful things to them or abandons them. These things aren\u2019t love.", "NTA. You are both badass and please let her know I am saving what she said because it was amazing.", "Holy shit NTA and I am so proud so both of you! You for being the best big sister ever and your sister for full on calling him on his bigoted crap. \n\nPeople who love their kids do not call them slurs. Period.", "NTA at all!!\n\nYour mom just outed herself to be an outright b---h and AH!", "NTA, her dad not only refused to support her but made it worse, she really needed the support that she got from you", "She's right OP it is your fault. How dare you teach your little sister to protect her peace and her emotional health! Now your mother might actually have to be a parent instead of  your dads cosigner!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow selfish of you! /s\n\nNTA", "Thank you for being there for your sister. She needs you more than ever right now.\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nNeeding time to process, and telling her she was lying before calling her a slur are two different things.\n\nAs in, \"that caught me off guard, but I love you of course. Can we talk more about it tomorrow when I've had time to process things?\"\n\nMaybe I got lucky when I told my family, but nobody deserves this treatment, and then get treated poorly again when they stand up for themselves.\n\nYou're a good sister. Your mom and step dad are A H.", "NTA and frankly your mom needs to learn how dangerously close she is to losing two kids if she lets one kid get bullied by an adult while reprimanding the other for standing by her.", "NTA but your mom is a piece of work. We all know her dad is TA but your mom is one as well.", "Info : can you please ask your mom what love did step dad show since he has learned ?", "NTA; it was good advice and nicely put.\n\nThe older generations and religious people are way to interested in the sex lives and sexual preferences of others. It is sick. Where a couple of centuries ago, people seemed to have some kind of weird hyperfocus on witches, now they are hyperfocused on what others prefer in bed.", "NTA. I wish I had a sweet lesbian big sister when I was coming out! I'm glad she has you.", "op=NTA\n\nSeems like good advice.  As you said, given the chance most bigots will OUT themselves.", "Nta", "NTA. Neither is your mother. Hell, not even the school.  YOUR STEPSISTER'S FATHER, THOUGH, HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO. >!If you don't know what I'm getting at, OP's stepdad is the asshole here, not only for calling his own daughter a sick f\\*ck or something, but being a man who shouldn't have become a parent in the first place.!<", "Not only are you NTA, you are the most NTA of any post I have read here to date.\n\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, you are your sister's biggest hero.  Both your mother, and your sister's father (I doubt either of you want to claim kinship outside of the necessary formalities right now) should be utterly ashamed of themselves!  Would you consider, if you are able, opening your home to your sister?  At 17, by the time any sort of custody/guardianship can be enforced, she'll likely be a legal adult.\n\nAgain, NTA to the highest power.", "NTA. Her dad showed his whole ass with his response and your mom kinda did too. They\u2019ll be lucky if you and your stepsister talk to them later on, because yuck. My husband\u2019s mom reacted extremely poorly when his brother came out and it changed my opinion of her. She\u2019s thankfully learned to accept him and his partner, but she still has some bigoted views and I call her ass out when it comes up. Your mom and stepdad need to decide if their feelings are more important than loving and accepting their daughters for who you both are.", "NTA - the suicide rate of queer teens/ young adults is so high because they feel that something is wrong with them and everyone around them seems to strenghten that feeling. You gave great advice to your sister. She needs someone like you.", "Fucking bravo!  That is proper sibling love if I\u2019ve ever seen it and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad for being the only decent person your sister could go to. Credit to your sister for the burn on your father because he frankly earned it for being an asshole like that, and sadly that\u2019s an insult to assholes\n\nNTA because your sister ia going to need you a lot more from now on. Sadly wouldn\u2019t doubt that your father is going to be more abusive from here on because of his youngest being out and proud of it", "I didn't think it didn't?", "Oh but he is ashamed. Ashamed his kid is one of *those* people. Not for his actions obviously, because why would he?", "But looks like he found his equal in her mom. She's awful as well. \n\nIf my partner ever did this to his, mine or our kid- he would have a hell lot of trouble than just getting filmed.\n\nKudos to OP and her sister- I hope sister moves out and dumps these bigoted parents.", "That get a dog line from the sister was brutal. \n\nMore power to her.", "Right? It's up to him to prove that love.", "He already knew he had a close gay family member: OP. If he hasn't managed to understand and accept the concept yet, well. I'm not holding my breath, is what I'm saying. \n\nFrankly, both parents sounds like insufferable bigots.", "OP you are truly an amazing older sister to this girl and it\u2019s awesome to know she\u2019s got you in her corner. You are NTA and a spectacular person. You gave her the tools to protect herself and you let her know she is not alone.", "He's more like a glass hammer or a chocolate kettle.", "My bad \ud83d\ude05", "Except if other find his actions shameful, then it's the kids fault for bringing shame onto the patriarch \ud83d\ude44", "Awwww, your dad is a good egg, that's so sweet.", "she was already 18 at the time", "My brother is a elder gen z and when he was 17 one of his friends took his life, he had a really tight group of friends so they all took it really hard and spiraled as a group for a few months. The best friend of this kid was getting to the point the others were really worried about him so they organised a intervention. They all wrote and read out statements about how much they care for him and then as a group found a private treatment center. \n\nHis family were wealthy thank goodness, they didn't realise how off the rails their son was until the group approached them with the information they had found and how he'd like to get treatment to help him with his addiction and greif.\n\nHe's now a ship Capitan or runs a farm, I can't remember who's who. But very impressive for a bloke in his early 20s", "A chocolate kettle sounds delicious.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05 thanks for this!!", "Now I want chocolate", "\"Don't start a fight but always finish one.\"\n\n\n\"If you must swing first, swing hard and connect.\"", "The Kids Are Alright \u2764\ufe0f", "If he called his own daughter the slur he's sure as shit said it about you in the past, possibly even to your Mom. I'd ask her next time. Totally NTA and thank you for advocating outing bigotry and not accepting abuse.", "But not very effective at boiling water.", "Is the kettle made of chocolate, or is it full of chocolate?\n\nIs it made of chocolate AND full of chocolate?\n\nI gotta get me some chocolate.", "It is made of chocolate so when you try to boil something in it the kettle melts and ruins everything. That said I suppose you could put chocolate in it and then put it on a double boiler and melt it down unless you just want to eat it whole."]}
