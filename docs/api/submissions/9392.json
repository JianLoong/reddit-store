I'm now 34 and she's 17. \n\nLast week, she got outed at school and to make a bad situation worse, her dad was mad at her, said she was lying for attention, and when she said it was for real, called her a slur. \n\nShe came over my apartment distraught and looking for some advice, I'm a lesbian and have been out for years.\n\nI told her that I was so sorry that happened, that was shitty since she deserved to be able to decide who to tell and when. But she wasn't the only one outed.\n\nHer dad? He just outed himself as a bigot. He outed himself as someone who should have never become a parent if he wasn't ready to love and accept his own damn child. \n\nAnd her school administrators? Outed themselves as negligent, probably even in the legal sense.\n\nBut overall, when I come out, I often out other people wayyy harder than I out myself.  It can be hard, but it can also feel empowering, to take a torch to the darkness, light it for all to see, and burn it away. \n\nJust by being in the room, and letting people tell on themselves, we're outing bigots. So I let them talk, and then go tell whoever I damn well please. I let them become known as ignorant and bigoted, cause that's a hell of a lot worse than being known as queer.\n\nI told her it was horrible her story was taken from her, but I hoped she knew it isn't taken forever. It's her right to say as much or as little to whoever she wants. \n\nAnd if someone gossips? They don't know her heart, they're just revealing their own hatred and ugliness. So don't let it eat at you. So document and record it if you want. Share it if you want, or keep it just in case. But whatever you do, it's all your call. It always is. \n\nWe talked well into the night. And she was feeling way better afterwards, and ready to go home and face her dad again.\n\nWell, shortly after she went home, my mom called me. She said that my sis had come home and told her dad that they should \"agree to disagree\" about her sexuality, and anything further he had to say about it spoke only to his own character and said fuck-all about her. \n\nAnd when he tried to argue she took out her phone and started filming and saying \"Do tell... You had a fucking child and weren't ready to love it? Get a fuckin DOG if you want something that'll come back begging when you abuse it\" \n\nMy mom called me furious because she thought I'd coached her on what to say, which I genuinely hadn't. I told her what advice I had given, and she was angry I even said that much, and asked me if it would have killed me to say that I think her dad loves her and to give him some time to understand. I was irate to hear that honestly because... Like what she actually said was heartbreaking and it hurts to hear my mom and stepdad didn't listen one bit. \n\nAITA for the advice I gave?", "created_utc": 1675801889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wc99b/aita_for_the_advice_i_gave_my_younger_stepsister/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The AHs here are mom and dad, without question.\n\nYour sister handled the bigotry in her best way, and if they didn't like it, the answer isn't to just give it time.

You are a great sister.", "Nta, your sister came to you for advice, and you gave it to her.\n\nMake sure to be there for her no matter what your mom's husband does though, there are plenty of cases where a kid ends their own life after being rejected by everyone around them.", "A parent who can't love their child because of sexual identity, or gender identity does not deserve to call themselves parents.

Bigoted old shits should be called out.", "NTA.\n\nYou're entirely right. Like entirely.\n\nFfs I tried to come out to my own father at 16 as bi and was told the most I could be was \"bicurious\" because I hadn't fucked a woman yet. Didn't know you had to have sex to know your sexuality (I didn't have sex with ANYONE male or female until I was 17. So how could I know if I was straight or not)Also got asked if it was a phase because of the area we lived in. News flash I'M STILL BI\n\nCame out as Demi got told \"that explains your mum\" (she may have been as well. Can't ask cause...sadly dads my only living parent)\n\nCame out as non-binary and instantly was misgendered and constantly done so SINCE.\n\nhe outed himself as a bigot the second he said \"lesbianism Is fine because it's women but men can't be together it's wrong\" \n\nYep he only accepts lesbianism due to the sexual gratification he can get out of it. \n\nIt's bullshit I know.\n\nBut what you said to your niece? Spot fucking on in every sense of the world. And if you can and are comfortable please be ready to grab her from that toxic as hell household the nanosecond she turns 18 and can GTFO. \n\nCause sadly bigots like to bigot and I genuinely worry for her physical and mental health and safety. Please keep close contact with her and have her have as many support adults as possible.\n\nAnd don't give her the bullshit lines your mum was trying to say. The whole \"he just needs time\" doesn't work and often isn't true.\n\nI'm 29. I came out as bi at 16. Demi last year non-binary this year. He's never changed. Often bigots don't. So keep an eye on her and help her plan an escape. \n\nAnd I suggest her writing to the school board about what happened. Maybe a local fb post or two. School can't afford this to get out and maybe it's the kick they need to do better.\n\nGood luck and good job to her.", "NTA.\n\nBut bare in mind what you said about people outting themselves as bigots...

Those are wise words that love is what you do.", "Yeah there's not having a great reaction and needing time to come around, and then there's calling your own child a liar and using a slur against them. The first one isn't good but maybe you can build from it. No matter how much they said they loved me, I don't know that I could ever see my parent the same way again if they're so quick to brand me a liar, with the added slap of a slur.", "No offense but I'm genuinely curious, how so?\n\nIt's something I even do a lot, though I tend to do the 0.5 zoom, phone sneakily sticking out of pocket, kinda thing instead of making it known", "We don't talk a lot honestly. He's an executive at a tech company, travels a lot, is a workaholic, and is often away. \n\nTBH his homophobia took me by surprise because he was always civil to me, if distant.

If it\u2019s  only the second one, then I\u2019ll take my cringe back lol", "You absolutely did the right thing. Something to think about and you don't need to respond here. When your sister turns 18, if her homelife becomes unbearable, would you be able to take her in until she goes to college? Because I can envision her dad making her life a living hell...", "The coldness could also be because he may have not viewed you as his \"real\" daughter and made it easier for him to distance himself from you.  \n\nI know of someone whose parents had gay friends, had a gay boss and seemed chill with it.  But when their child came out, there were problems...\n\nSo when you came out, he was probably like \"Oh, she's a lesbian.  Okay, nothing to do with me and not really my child.  But when 'his' daughter came out, his immediate reaction was she CAN'T be a lesbian.  She's of my blood, she has to be straight, blah blah.\"", "Ohhh honestly the reasons I've recorded stuff and suggested she did too was... \n\n- to get in the habit of thoroughly documenting hate speech / discrimination, especially before she starts in academia or the workplace. Title 9 and HR become a lot easier to deal with when you come in with video, they can't play the \"he said she said\" game! \n\n- to provide some personal safety, since people tend to not escalate to vilence if there's gonna be evidence. Especially if you say you're live streaming and have an app that films to a remote backup. \n\n- to be believed if or when something needs to be reported to authorities. Police and many workplaces in our area have a pretty strong bias against queer people and will do fuck-all unless you give them a clear cut case of discrimination or hate crimes on a silver platter and make it clear you know the law and that they are legally required to address it. \n\nI don't ever mean it to be a petty thing, for me I just consider documentation a really vital safety tool and one of the only ones a minor can actually have since I can't exactly suggest she gets a weapon or something for when shit gets bad. Which realistically, where we are, it can", "So what you\u2019re saying is that it\u2019s your fault for my cringe \ud83d\udc40 (I\u2019m kidding!)\n\nThose are all good reasons and she\u2019s lucky to have your support", "Aw thanks :) \n\nHappy to explain, I sometimes forget how stuff that seems obvious to me isn't obvious to people who haven't had to navigate this shit or help someone else do that"]}
