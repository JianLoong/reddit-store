If your father wants someone else to do all that for your brother, then *he* should do it.\n\nIf your brother has some kind of developmental or mental issue that prevents him from being able to do simple things like that for himself, he needs to be seen, diagnosed, and given the proper treatment so he can function like a normal person.", "NTA Dale's a grown adult, if he's to lazy to do his own leg work for a job he doesn't deserve one", "NTA, is this even real.  This seems so ridiculous to me I can't imagine it being real. \nThank your dad for disowning you and get yourself into therapy for the problems you must have for having such an AH Father and a weak enabling mother.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is a nut job who seems incapable of both love and logic. They raised their golden child to be a useless mess, and still demand that you do their bidding. Getting \"disowned\" sounds like a relief. And you know your brother would already be getting any inheritance anyway, if that's what underlines that threat.\n\nAnd just on the practical matter at hand, why does your dad have the time to call and harass you repeatedly, when he could have spent the same amount of time calling the company?", "NTA. This is nuts. If your dad is so sure your brother can\u2019t do it, then why doesn\u2019t your dad just call? Why does he have to middle man this situation?

Weirdly enough, parents telling you to do things mean a whole lot less when you\u2019re a full grown adult out living on your own.

This is bananas. He's 28 years old. Why is it your responsibility to handle this for him? It's not.", "NTA.  I would have said no when asked to call the company to see if they are hiring.  This is all part of getting a job.  You were a kind sister helping out but scheduling the interview too?  What next, do they want you to do the interview and take the job too???\n\nTake pride in being disowned.  Now you don't have to help your brother or dad anymore.  I'd see if your mother doesn't have a way out as she is also enabling this to continue too.", "I have a difficult family (I was no contact with my mom, am low contact with dad and sister for similar I was the fixer reasons) so I fully get that \"walk away\" is a lot easier said than done. I know that you're going to get a lot of that advice and I just want to say that it's okay if you're not there yet. You deserve better and I hope for your sake that they come around and you get to make the choice.\n\nIf it helps at all, I work front desk and if i took a call from someone for her brother (who didn't need disability accomodation), I'd walk to the HR person's office/email them and say \"hey, this guy's sister called to set an interview for him. Trash the resume?\" And I would 100% expect them to say yes. If he can't set up his own interview (again, this doesn't apply to people with legitimate needs for accomodation), why would they believe that he will accomplish the job on his own?\n\nSomething I've had limited success with is being curious instead of confrontational. It's important to match the tone to the words, other wise it just comes across as passive aggressive, but sometimes if you have people explain their fucked up expectations to you it will kinda sink in. I'm currently focussing in therapy on how much damage it did that my dad always wanted to \"not take sides\" between my mom (the aggressor) and me, even when I was a literal child. I know how much it hurts to be let down so profoundly even by your \"good\" parent. I'm rambling but I'm just really sorry, OP. You weren't the asshole at all.", "You are nta, but your father and Dale are! Incredible misogyny demonstrated here.  How is he going to work if he can't even schedule an interview.  Hope you don't live with them.  Good luck to you.  Your mom also kinda sucks for not sticking up for you-she probably has been treated like this her entire marriage.  Get far away.", "NTA. Honestly, let them disown you. You\u2019re better off. \n\nNothing you said to your dad makes you an ah. *Nothing*. Those are straight facts. You\u2019re brother is an adult. He should he doing this for himself. You are not his parent but even if you were, still not your responsibility. \n\nYour dad and brother sound like toxic misogynistic assholes and you poor mom is stuck appeasing and enabling them. I wouldn\u2019t the surprised if there is abuse happening in that house too. Your dad became verbally abusive to you when you set a clear boundary and called out toxic behaviour. I\u2019d go NC if it was me.", " Not the AITA but give us a n update please", "NTA. Your dad is out of line. You're an adult and so is your brother. It would be one thing to sit down and talk to a teenager about the application process but not to coddle an adult.\n\nYour dad telling you what he says goes isn't a thing when you're living on your own, are working on an advanced degree and are married.", "NTA and as an HR manager who hires.  I would not hire anyone who doesn't have the ambition to do their own application.   You can always tell people who are forced to look for a job because they blow the interview on purpose.  It is not your fault he will not work and it is not your responsibility to help him get a job.", "NTA! And I am so sorry you are dealing with this. When someone shows you who the truly are and what they think of you believe it. I know you didn\u2019t ask but I would go NC. That was absolutely way too much for your father to say to you over something that is not your responsibility! You didn\u2019t push your brother out of your vagina! And your brother \u201cdisowned\u201d you, that\u2019s laughable. Anyways. If you go NC good riddance", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like much of value was lost in the disowning.", "NTA - if anything you were too kind. The words fuck and off would have been my response. I\u2019m surprised your brother has the go in him to actively disown you. Or did your dad do that on his behalf too?", "NTA. Your brother has been enabled to be this way but is old enough to wipe his own backside. What your dad said to you was absolutely appalling!!! And I am worried that your mum feels stuck there; could she live with you or anyone else? Your dad and brother will probably live together until one of them dies. Sad little people that they are. Be glad he has declared that you are disowned, why the heck would you want them in your life, they are horrid.", "NTA Now he has disowned you, he has to go speak to one of your other siblings and make them his scapegoat. Because believe me, your family will always need a scapegoat and you are no longer there to kick. If he starts speaking badly to them as they do you, they will cut him off. Before too long he will only have his useless son to care for him in his old age. If your mum starts to see the family disintegrate she might actually start taking a side that is not your dads. Well, one can dream. Just stay radio silent and wait it out.", "NTA !!! If your brother can't submit his resume and ask for an interview himself, he doesn't deserve a job.\n\nWhat happens when your parents pass away? Is he going to be an 80 year old who has never worked? \n\nThe only way this would have been even reasonable is if you worked at the company that was hiring and your brother had special needs and they had a program for hiring people that required extreme accommodations to have a job.  It would be admiral bowl that you were being the point person in that case but because your brother is just spoiled, this is not the case", "Yipes.  The misogyny there is out of control.  Is there somewhere you can go?", "NTA....F' Dale....and Pops too, if he pushes it!", "NTA. ffs, he\u2019s an adult. You ain\u2019t his nanny/keeper/slave/minder. He can sort his own life out. Your dad is just as bad. I feel so sad for you \ud83d\ude1e", "I\u2019d like to schedule an interview for my 28yr old brother, because my dad made me. \n\nHe sounds promising! Let\u2019s get him in here!", "If Dale is so freaking lazy/incompetent he can't even make a phone call to set up an interview, what is going to happen when some fool does give him a job? Will you have to do his work for him?", "NTA\n\nthem disowning you did you a favour, they now have zero leverage.", "NTA. Nothing we can do about not being the obvious favorite", "Honestly? Fuck that noise. Doesn't sound like Dale will be a loss to anyone and if your Dad is that disrespectful you don't need to talk to him either.

You're married? Your older brother is a full grown adult. This is baffling. OP, let me tell you a secret: You no longer rely on your parents for money. The power has shifted and you are the one with all of the power over your own life. Let them disown you and don't talk to them for about a year. If you want to be extra tell them they will never see their new grandkid just before you block them. Yeah, I know it's hard and you wish your parents were the parents you wanted them to be. But let them disown you for a bit because that is them shooting themselves in the foot at this point in your life, and from an outside perspective it's so dumb it's a little bit hilarous they think that will do anything. You do waaay more for them than they do for you."]}
