You deserve better and I hope for your sake that they come around and you get to make the choice.\n\nIf it helps at all, I work front desk and if i took a call from someone for her brother (who didn't need disability accomodation), I'd walk to the HR person's office/email them and say \"hey, this guy's sister called to set an interview for him. Trash the resume?\" And I would 100% expect them to say yes. If he can't set up his own interview (again, this doesn't apply to people with legitimate needs for accomodation), why would they believe that he will accomplish the job on his own?\n\nSomething I've had limited success with is being curious instead of confrontational. It's important to match the tone to the words, other wise it just comes across as passive aggressive, but sometimes if you have people explain their fucked up expectations to you it will kinda sink in.

Because believe me, your family will always need a scapegoat and you are no longer there to kick. If he starts speaking badly to them as they do you, they will cut him off. Before too long he will only have his useless son to care for him in his old age. If your mum starts to see the family disintegrate she might actually start taking a side that is not your dads. Well, one can dream. Just stay radio silent and wait it out.", "NTA !!! If your brother can't submit his resume and ask for an interview himself, he doesn't deserve a job.\n\nWhat happens when your parents pass away?

You think the dad is going to agree to that?", "And not to mention how this could negatively impact OOP in her career when Dale inevitably fucks up", "oh, okay! i personally have thick skin and don't let much get to me so i kind of rolled my eyes at those messages, but i still wanted to make it known that those kind of messages aren't cool. would it do anything to stop them? probably not.", "Obviously NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion though - if dad can call the OP to make the appointment, why can't dad just call to make the appointment himself?  I know it isn't logical, but what would make someone think that what this a job application needs is a third person who won't be doing the job?", "If you are disowned, If it were me, I'd look at it as a blessing.  Some people don't need to be in your life.  Let your brother grow up and get his own job...  NTAH.", "NTA. \n\nGo no contact with them. Low contact with your mom. She can meet you for coffee, away from those idiots.", ">\u201cthey never want to see me again\u201c\n\nYou win! Enjoy the peace and quiet. Really Just go NC on their sorry asses. \n\nNTA", "Uh, NTA.", "NTA\n\nSend a scathing email to both of them. Tell your father that he should be ashamed of raising such a useless son that cannot do anything for himself and that it's his fault that your brother has no prospects and depends on everyone else for everything and you wish him luck because due to his failure as a father, he's going to have to raise his adult so for the rest of his life. You should also email your brother that it's his fault that he's like this because he depends on everyone but himself to do stuff and he needs to get his shit together because no one would want to be his partner/ spouse as he has no prospects or plans for his life and that it's also your father's fault for coddling him and causing him to be so useless. Your intent should be, to tell the truth, and only the truth in the most scathing ways possible so that they can both wake up. Tell them both that you also disown them and they should not contact you either because you're embarrassed by them. They've burnt bridges so you should as well.", "NTA but know that these people are optional problems. Best to distance.", "NTA. absolutely ridiculous that people are telling you to commit sewer slide for this but also, you\u2019re completely RIGHT! you shouldn\u2019t have to do that for your brother and your dad coddling him continuously is hurting him and everyone around them. but your mom shouldn\u2019t be staying out of it if she agrees with you, she should also be stepping up to parent her son.", "Def NTA\nHow is he gong to show up to work if he can\u2019t schedule an interview. I wouldn\u2019t hire someone who\u2019s siblings are doing all the leg work for them unless they had a disability. I\u2019m not an employer but if\u2026.\n\nGood on you for saying NO you have to put a jam the wheel in order for things to change.", "NTA if he can't even be responsible enough to set up an interview, how will he be as an employee. Are you gonna have to quit your job so you can work his shifts too? Your dad is delusional if he thinks this is appropriate behavior for a grown ass man. Let him flounder in the real world and figure it out for himself", "NTA - Toxic people (including mom) and you need to go low-contact (or no-contact) with them.", "OMG if your dad has time to harass you over the phone then he has time to spoon feed your brother his next interview and HE can definitely make the calls on your brothers behalf since your brother is refusing to do so for himself. \n\nYour dad is coming across as super misoginistic and possibly narcissistic, and your mom is enabling it. NTA in case that wasn't clear and to appease the bots. And good luck.", "NTA. Your dad has enough time to cuss you out yet not enough to set up the interview if it is that important to get a job for, and im going to be blunt here, your bum of a brother, which he should be the one taking the steps of getting the job since he would be the one working?", "NTA- you are right.\n\nGo NC with your father and Dale. They are TA.", "NTA\n\nI have a sister like your brother. I did this for her ONCE. Because after I wasted all of my time doing it, she got called for an interview - and refused to even go. \n\nAfter that, I refused to ever waste my time on jobs for her again - from searching for them to applying for them. She doesn't appreciate the effort and when she doesn't bother to even call back on the jobs or show up for interviews, why should I even bother?", "Nta.", "NTA. My mom pulls this shit on me a lot when my brother was just graduating high school. I helped him out here and there but sometimes he would want me to just do whatever he needed? It's real shitty. You don't have to find your brother a job.", "nta ... if he cant fill in a simple portal to arrange his own interview the in the hell is gonna be able to do his job if anything your dad should be doing it since they coddled him ...", "NTA- \u201cDale is 28 years old. If he can\u2019t schedule his own interview then he doesn\u2019t deserve the job.\u201d *click* \nIs what I would\u2019ve did in your shoes :\u2019)", "NTA. Take the disowning as the blessing it is, even though we all know you\u2019ll only be disowned until you\u2019re useful again. It\u2019s time to start setting some serious boundaries with this family of yours. Is walking away from them a possibility for you?", "NTA! I would have refused to call the company for anyone to check if they were hiring. If anyone is serious about wanting a job, that is the least they could do. Dale is an adult who I assume knows how to use a phone to call people. You are right, you\u2019re not Dale\u2019s secretary! Good for you for standing up for yourself and recognize when you are being mistreated.", "NTA\n\nYour family sucks, sorry", "nta but your mom isn't on your side. remaining quiet or not wanting to rock the boat is letting the other side or the bullies win. she's on their side by staying silent", "But she is a she therefore clearly responsible for \"babysitting/doing chores\" for the brother.\n\nI wish they had a font for sarcasm.", "Sounds like they may think secretarial work is a woman\u2019s job, with the, \u201cI told you to do it, so do it,\u201d and the utter lack of shame when called out on hypocrisy. Add to that that Dad evidently doesn\u2019t expect the same obedience from Older Brother.", "OP is not dependant on her father in any way, knows she's being mistreated and still feels bad about being disowned by him. Big clue that she's grown up in a misogynistic and abusive household. You don't think the mom has been subject to this same abuse?\n\nThe mom has no power in that household and likely doesn't have access to resources which would allow her to leave. Should OP cut them off? Yes, she has to put herself first. But don't try to tell her that her mom doesn't give a shit about her. The mom is just trying to keep her head above water in a bad situation.", "Absolutely, I agree with you. I think that both (father and son) think its beneath them to do admin/secretarial tasks.\n\nHmm, who's taking the bet that Dad treats the wife like a slave? This apple may not have fallen far from the tree.", "No company wants to hire someone who needed his sister to fill out the application.", "I\u2019m not on the spectrum (though I can see it from where I sit), and your dad\u2019s behavior is UNACCEPTABLE, so claiming you\u2019re over-reacting because of a potential diagnosis makes them even MORE of a pair of assholes. NTA.", "If your dad doesn't think brother can even be motivated to fill out an online application, how does he think he'll motivate brother to actually show up at an interview? Or a job?", "If the brother isn't capable of 1) making a phone call and 2) doing the online application, there are very few jobs that he will be capable of doing.  Even the most basic jobs require people that can follow directions and use basic technology.", "Gonna guess that the answer is sexism. \n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s an online portal, so they probably wouldn\u2019t know who filled it out. Of course, OP can\u2019t do the interview for him, too.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf"]}
