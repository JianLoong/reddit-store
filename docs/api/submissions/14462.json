You deserve better and I hope for your sake that they come around and you get to make the choice.\n\nIf it helps at all, I work front desk and if i took a call from someone for her brother (who didn't need disability accomodation), I'd walk to the HR person's office/email them and say \"hey, this guy's sister called to set an interview for him. Trash the resume?\" And I would 100% expect them to say yes. If he can't set up his own interview (again, this doesn't apply to people with legitimate needs for accomodation), why would they believe that he will accomplish the job on his own?\n\nSomething I've had limited success with is being curious instead of confrontational. It's important to match the tone to the words, other wise it just comes across as passive aggressive, but sometimes if you have people explain their fucked up expectations to you it will kinda sink in.

Because believe me, your family will always need a scapegoat and you are no longer there to kick. If he starts speaking badly to them as they do you, they will cut him off. Before too long he will only have his useless son to care for him in his old age. If your mum starts to see the family disintegrate she might actually start taking a side that is not your dads. Well, one can dream. Just stay radio silent and wait it out.", "NTA !!! If your brother can't submit his resume and ask for an interview himself, he doesn't deserve a job.\n\nWhat happens when your parents pass away?
