I have remained constant that fianc\u00e9 and I could build a life together and tried to ignore the SIL's relentless antagonizing and bullying for sake of my relationship with my fianc\u00e9 and his family. Before we were engaged SIL told me I was not family because we were not engaged or married and she was the wife.  Asked my fianc\u00e9 why he doesn't look at her anymore. SIL nor the brother do not speak to me when I'm in their presence. When SIL does talk to me it's condescending. I tried many times to make the relationship better but she is very narcissistic and manipulative and has his whole family fooled... my fianc\u00e9 tells me to keep trying and maybe one day it will be better (it's not better). I have always wanted a close relationship with my in-laws. The tension with SIL have made it near impossible. I have been going to counseling in hopes to gain insight for my fianc\u00e9 and I. He will acknowledge but never fully validate my hurt in this situation. The list goes on and on. \n\nHowever, I had the final straw when I received a text last week asking/telling me that she was throwing her husband a birthday party the day of my bridal shower (she is invited to the shower). She stated \"we don't want to steal your thunder\". To be clear, I don't mind them having a party that day, the whole day is not meant for me. I do however think it's disrespectful considering my shower has been planned since February and they have never had a birthday party for him before (it's NOT a milestone bday).  Given her and my relationship I think she's intentional in this, and I feel like she is doing this to cause trouble (because that's what her pattern is). However, I told her no worries and to enjoy celebrating his bday. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 see's no problem in this... Wants us to attend. And, continues to deny both SIL and brother's actions. I expected that my fianc\u00e9 would not want to attend because it upset me. I am being constantly being disrespected and he won't validate my feelings. Things are not getting better. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting myself or my fianc\u00e9 to attend?", "created_utc": 1688051484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m7j37/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_a_party_thrown_the/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
