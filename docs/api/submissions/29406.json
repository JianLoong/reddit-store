{"id": 29406, "submission_id": "17dgx8u", "title": "AITA for giving my brother an \"impossible\" ultimatum if he wants me back into his life?", "selftext": "I 32M was dating a girl named Lisa from 20 to 27 y.o. and my brother, Derek 35M, started dating Lisa's older sister, Carrie, a few years after  we got together. Things were good, we got all got along and I thought  Lisa would be the one I marry.\n\nWell it didn't turn out like that. Derek got caught sleeping with one of Carrie's best friends and she immediately dumped him. It was already shitty enough that my brother cheated on someone I was close to but in the aftermath there was a lot of pressure on Lisa to dump me too. Carrie was convinced I knew about the cheating, and she told Lisa she'd be a terrible sister if she forced Carrie to keep a link to Derek. So we tried to make it work but eventually Lisa did break up with me.\n\nI was devastated to lose Lisa and very bitter that I was the one who got  stuck with the short end while Derek kept his mistress and life was still intact. I moved back with my parents and made it a nightmare for  Derek or his mistress to step into the house. No matter how much my parents or Derek begged me to forgive him I refused. Eventually, I took a job in another state so I thankfully didn't see them anymore.\n\nMAYBE I could've moved on by now but Derek's made that impossible. His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't  want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\". On top of that he always blamed Lisa for ending our relationship since in his eyes she could've toughed it out if she really loved me.\n\nSince then I mostly cut him out of my life. I didn't attend his wedding, haven't met their kid until recently, etc.\n\nCurrent situation: I recently moved back home and am living with my parents until I can find my own place and as a result everyone's badgering me to make amend with Derek but I've been able to mostly avoid him.\n\nYesterday, it all came to a head when Derek came to my parents house with his mistress and infant son. To make a long evening short, I ignored them and tried to leave but he and my dad cornered me and begged me to talk to him. He said he misses me, wants me to be an uncle, and he'd do  anything to have me back in his life.\n\nAfter some thinking I came up with the following conditions\n\n1. He admits he's the reason my relationship with Lisa ended\n2. He has to accept I will never have anything to do with mistress\n3. Apologize for all the bullshit he put me through\n4. He admits his relationship with the mistress is/was wrong\n\nHe quickly accepted the first three conditions and I do think his apologies were genuine. But he refused the last condition and his mistress blew a gasket, called me all sorts of names and they left.\n\nSo that's where were at now. Him calling me an asshole for trying to shit on his relationship and me not budging, while my parents are seesawing between begging me just let it go and telling Derek to suck it up.\n\nMaybe I am the asshole since at this point I don't think they're going to  break up so all I'm doing is making their marriage harder.

You don\u2019t have to forgive your brother. If you want to carry that bitter poison and allow it to affect your life going forward, that\u2019s on you. \n\nSo, your brother is an AH and a cheater. He had to live with that not you. He wasn\u2019t married to this other woman. \n\nWas his behavior trash? Absolutely. Did he force your girlfriend to break you with you? No. Your ex and your ex\u2019s sister hold the blame for that one. \n\nYou need to move on with your life.", "YTA - no. Lisa was the reason your relationship ended. She could have found a way to make it work. Like just don\u2019t invite her sister to family events with your brother? If it was something like birthday/holidays - you can alternate or they can suck it up. It\u2019s not his fault that she dumped you.\n\nHe\u2019s married and has been with her for 5yrs and they have a child. She\u2019s not a \u201cmistress\u201d anymore. Saying that his cheating was wrong is understandable and right. But to still refer to her as that and say that their *current marriage* is wrong, is petty.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t you blaming Carrie for pressuring her sister to break up with you? Why aren\u2019t you mad at Lisa for throwing away a 7yr relationship? Are you sure she didn\u2019t actually want to break up with you anyways?", "YTA\n\nBruh\u2026 grow up.\n\nAnd the whole \u201chis relationship with his mistress was, and continues to be wrong\u201d\n\nAre you even trying to be taken seriously with that? They\u2019re married and have a kid.\n\nIf you\u2019re this much of a whiner, no wonder she was looking for a reason to dump you.", "YTA-\n\n>His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\".\n\nShe didn't want to split, so he cheated. Such a pathetic excuse. Just a verbal dump, even a text dumping, wouldve been a better split than him cheating on her. He also could've just stuck his neck and an say you didnt have anything to do nor any knowledge of his actions to your ex, since that was the claimed issue.\n\nBUT! While hes ofc an AH to carrie, he didnt push your gf to break up with you. His actions were simply towards carrie and carrie alone. \n\n>Carrie was convinced I knew about the cheating, and she told Lisa she'd be a terrible sister if she forced Carrie to keep a link to Derek. So we tried to make it work but eventually Lisa did break up with me.\n\nYou say yourself that Carrie is the one who was convincing Lisa. She essentially weaponized Lisas familial feelings for Carrie to turn her against you under her assumption that you knew about Dereks actions. \n\n>On top of that he always blamed Lisa for ending our relationship since in his eyes she could've toughed it out if she really loved me.\n\nHe's not entirely wrong here, in the end the only person who could make Lisa break up with you is still Lisa herself. Convinced by her sister or not, its ultimately her own decision. She couldve shut her sisters accusations towards you down had she believed you enough, or even shut it down because your relationship to her doesnt equate to what Derek did to Carrie.\n\nYour brother has a happy family now, he clearly didnt love Carrie. An found love, albeit in a horrible still fucked up fashion, with his current WIFE. Shes not a mistress, shes his first and only wife. You dont have to like her, or have anything to do with her. You dont have to like him or how he got with her. But you cant blame him for lisa dumping you. \n\nYour feelings on this matter is displaced bitter resentment that you've allowed to grow and fester. And its because you don't believe he or she deserve to be happy when you arent anymore.", "YTA. \n\nSix or so years ago your long-term girlfriend dumped you because her sister pressured her and made up lies about you knowing that your brother was cheating on his less long-term girlfriend. Since then your brother has gotten married and has a child. His WIFE is not his mistress and their relationship is not wrong. She never was his mistress since he and Carrie were never married. They were dating. Still not okay for him to cheat, but you are making it out like they were on their way to the alter. \n\nThis is a you and Lisa issue. Your brother owes you nothing. He is not responsible for Lisa looking for a way out.", "YTA.  She is not his mistress, she is his wife.  And they have a child.

Better get a life before yours is over.", "Imma go with NTA\n\nIs it a dick move to make your brother say his relationship with his now wife and mother of his child was/is a mistake? Yes.\n\nThat being said you just want him to leave you alone and you've made that more than clear\n\nAlso\n\n>His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\".\n\nThe fuck?

Stop trying to break them up just because you're hurt that a girlfriend dumped you . . .what, five years ago?\n\nWhen did this", "YTA.  You are holding it against your brother for something that your ex did.  If she wanted you that much, she would have stood up for you, not bowed to peer pressure from her sister.  Look how easy you cut off your brother?", "NTA, I don't tolerate this behavior. Just because he's family doesn't mean you have to give in. He's an ass and he didn't apologize. If it were me, I would never have moved back home. \n\nPeople will say he's family. But I believe that if you have family that treats you badly or won't admit to what he did wrong, it makes it worse. Family doesn't mean you have to tolerate being treated like he did. If he cared, he would have told Lisa you didn't know. He didn't, and that tells me how much he cares about you. In fact, I would have him tell Lisa now that you didn't know. I'm sure many will disagree, and if they think family has a right to treat you like crap and that you should tolerate it, it shows you how they really feel about the concept of family.", "NTA. no one is obligated a relationship. and these are your conditions for this one. he was old enough to know cheating is wrong.", "ESH You need therapy to get over Lisa. You are blaming your brother, who is TA, for Lisa breaking up with you when in all reality she is a grown woman who made the decision to do so. No one held a gun to her head. Your brother could have simply broken up with his ex instead of sleeping with someone else. He is a coward. Stop blaming your brother\u2019s WIFE. She is not his mistress. He married her. You are taking your grief over your relationship with your ex out on her. She never forced your brother. She didn\u2019t force your ex to break up with you. She\u2019s an AH for messing with someone involved with someone else. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t have to like her or have a relationship with her but she is not the devil incarnate. For the record, your brother\u2019s relationship with his wife is not wrong. He didn\u2019t commit adultery on his ex. You will never be at peace in your life until you seek help to rid you of this anger.", "I keep looking at this story and I think what's really making OP bitter is that the only one who seems to have gotten the short end of the stick is him, as he said. \n\nOP dates someone for close to a decade. OP's brother comes and starts dating his GF's sister for a couple of years. Brother decided to cheat, imploding the preexisting relationship OP had with his GF. Why did the brother cheat? \"It's her fault, because she wouldn't break up with me otherwise.\" \n\nOP has to move back in with his parents, which I assume is due to having to find a new place after breaking up with his girlfriend. Family immediately starts pressuring OP to forgive his brother and get over it to the point he leaves the state to get away. \n\nMeanwhile? Brother gets parental support. Brother gets a baby with his cheating partner. Brother gets married. Brother gets parents once again cornering and harassing OP about how he's being a jerk to \"poor poor\" brother. Brother is living happily ever after and OP got all the consequences.\n\nI think ESH, but damn, I sorta feel bad for OP. He's never been given any time to process having his world fall apart so he'd be less bitter because everyone else is focused on making the brother comfortable. His only time to process was after getting to the point he had to leave his whole family to get peace. Which probably just made the whole thing fester even worse.\n\nOP if your brother makes you that unhappy don't be around him. If your parents are going to keep pushing you to be friendly with him, you're going to have to let them go too.", "Interesting.  Seems like this is the exception to the usual Reddit response of \u201cGo NC or LC, when a family sides with the Cheater & their Affair Partner (better than Mistress?).  \n\nThis time, many here saying OP should just \u201cget over it\u201d & freaking out over using the term \u201cmistress\u201d.  Makes me wonder if it\u2019s because the hurt party is a GUY.\n\nYes, OP has some misplaced anger but he\u2019s not an A H. His Brother\u2019s cheating set a series of events in motion that hurt him but his feelings have been minimized and dismissed by his entire family.\n\nOP should get personal therapy in order to move on & find his own happiness, for himself.

He was a coward who blamed everyone but himself. If he wanted to leave, he could've just left. He didn't need to hurt someone so horribly. Carrie lost a bf AND a close friend in the process. No one deserves that. The wife was one of Carrie's best friends. She threw away a friendship with someone she was close to and was trusted, by sleeping with her boyfriend. Low caliber people. Honestly, you don't need either of them in your life. You may need to seek some therapy, but don't put yourself in a situation where being near them causes you pain.

States that he is told the reason is his brother. Brother still pressures him into a maintaining a relationship but utterly ignores any damage he has done. \n\nThe problem I have here with people is that the OP needing therapy doesn't make him an asshole, the fact he is told why and he is bitter about it doesn't make him an asshole and being angry for loosing someone who cared about because of a family member doesn't make him an asshole. \n\nHe is allowed to hold bitter feelings toward his brother and he's literally allowed to even imply tha the can't afford therapy because he had to move back home! I mean am I the only one connecting the whole \"need therapy but I'm too poor\" moment by virtue of him moving back home? \n\nI mean cripes people, even assuming and making assumptions about why he was dumped is pretty far reaching.

Things were good, we got all got along and I thought  Lisa would be the one I marry.\n\nWell it didn't turn out like that. Derek got caught sleeping with one of Carrie's best friends and she immediately dumped him. It was already shitty enough that my brother cheated on someone I was close to but in the aftermath there was a lot of pressure on Lisa to dump me too. Carrie was convinced I knew about the cheating, and she told Lisa she'd be a terrible sister if she forced Carrie to keep a link to Derek. So we tried to make it work but eventually Lisa did break up with me.\n\nI was devastated to lose Lisa and very bitter that I was the one who got  stuck with the short end while Derek kept his mistress and life was still intact. I moved back with my parents and made it a nightmare for  Derek or his mistress to step into the house. No matter how much my parents or Derek begged me to forgive him I refused. Eventually, I took a job in another state so I thankfully didn't see them anymore.\n\nMAYBE I could've moved on by now but Derek's made that impossible. His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't  want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\". On top of that he always blamed Lisa for ending our relationship since in his eyes she could've toughed it out if she really loved me.\n\nSince then I mostly cut him out of my life. I didn't attend his wedding, haven't met their kid until recently, etc.\n\nCurrent situation: I recently moved back home and am living with my parents until I can find my own place and as a result everyone's badgering me to make amend with Derek but I've been able to mostly avoid him.\n\nYesterday, it all came to a head when Derek came to my parents house with his mistress and infant son. To make a long evening short, I ignored them and tried to leave but he and my dad cornered me and begged me to talk to him. He said he misses me, wants me to be an uncle, and he'd do  anything to have me back in his life.\n\nAfter some thinking I came up with the following conditions\n\n1. He admits he's the reason my relationship with Lisa ended\n2. He has to accept I will never have anything to do with mistress\n3. Apologize for all the bullshit he put me through\n4. He admits his relationship with the mistress is/was wrong\n\nHe quickly accepted the first three conditions and I do think his apologies were genuine. But he refused the last condition and his mistress blew a gasket, called me all sorts of names and they left.\n\nSo that's where were at now. Him calling me an asshole for trying to shit on his relationship and me not budging, while my parents are seesawing between begging me just let it go and telling Derek to suck it up.\n\nMaybe I am the asshole since at this point I don't think they're going to  break up so all I'm doing is making their marriage harder.

Nor is it for you to determine if the relationship with his wife is wrong - that's their business.\n\nYes, YTA.", "Yeah, Derek did a shitty thing, but your ex's reaction to it seems totally unjustified. It is not reasonable at all for her sister to expect her to break up with you because your brother did something shitty. I am astounded that she actually did. But listen dude, that isn't your brother's fault. Your ex made a very bizarre choice there. Yes, it only happened because of what your brother did, but he didn't directly cause it. My thinking is that, maybe she just wasn't very invested in the relationship anyway, to have broken up so easily. It's a bit of a headscratcher.\n\nYour blaming your brother for destroying your relationship is unjust, IMHO, and your treatment of him since then is likewise not good. Do you think he imagined that his actions would ruin your relationship? Who would? Make thijngs awkward, sure, but I never would have guessed that what happened would have happened.", "Soft YTA. \nOP is clearly having a lot of trouble accepting the end of his previous relationship. While his brother's behaviour was terrible, it's also on Lisa that she did not choose the relationship ultimately. Life sucks. Sometimes the people we love will take decisions that don't include us. I feel for OP but he really does need to process his emotions about it and move on. He doesn't have to be super enthusiastic about his brother's wife or their marriage, but being insulting to SIL is AH behaviour. Their relationship may have begun as a result of cheating, but Carrie is long gone, brother is married and  they have a kid now.\n\nEven if they *were* to break up, as OP seems to have hoped , SIL is the mom of OP's nephew. She'll always be connected to the family. Breaking them up will probably just cause a lot more pain for everyone in the family. OP needs to figure out if his (very real) pain is worth creating more. \n\nThings *have* changed and OP needs to accept that. \n\nSoft YTA because it's really difficult to process this sort of thing and because I can't tell whether the brother is being egregiously entitled or pushing himself onto OP, or whether his actions are normal for someone who made such a big mistake in the past but is protecting his family now (seen through OP's negative lens).", "YTA.

For reasons many have pointed out including:\n\n* Lisa dumped you because of pressure from her sister. \n\n* Derrick never had a mistress and regardless, she is now his wife. They have a kid together who is your nephew. \n\n* Your demands are petty, unreasonable and insulting. \n\n* You\u2019re living with your parents and making their lives difficult. \n\n* You should consider therapy and not Reddit. \n\nLisa and Carrie are gone from both of your lives. You can continue along this path but eventually, your entire family just gets sick of listening to you whining about that one girl that dumped you because she had no backbone and her sister was manipulative. When that happens they stop inviting you to family events or special occasions, then they just stop all contact. \n\nYour brother made a slight error in judgement in starting another relationship before ending his current one but we all make mistakes. He could have been much stronger in actually dumping Carrie but he wasn\u2019t.\n\nOne day, your parents will both be gone and the only immediate family you have will be your brother and you\u2019ll need that relationship more than you think you will.", "Yta.

You just come across as being in denial over the actual role you played in your own breakup. Maybe stop blaming everyone else and do some work on yourself/move on.", "ESH. Will go against the tide here with no. 4, their relationship WAS wrong as your brother specifically said that he cheated as a way to get out of his relationship which besides being a coward move, cause someone hurt.

Maybe try therapy first before forcing an apology.", "OP, I absolutely guarantee that Derek's cheating was not the only reason that Lisa broke up with you!  Of course breakups usually involve a \"last straw\", and the drama with her sister may have indeed been the last straw, but that straw wouldn't have \"broken the camel's back\" unless there were also a billion other \"straws\" eroding your relationship over time.\n\nLook at yourself, and how you treat the people in your life, including your own parents, before you think of Derek again.  Are you always kind and reasonable?  Were you always kind and reasonable to Lisa?  Are you being kind and reasonable towards your infant nibling?

They are obviously right for each other, and Carrie wasn\u2019t. His cheating was not the reason Lisa dumped you. I think you have to realize that, after 7 years together, she may have also wanted an out and her sister gave her the perfect reason. If Lisa truly loved you, she wouldn\u2019t have dumped you over her sister. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me to find out that the only one who hasn\u2019t moved on is YOU.

This is all on Lisa, you dodged a bullet.", "ESH Your last point is stupid. Why would you expect any married person to admit their own relationship is wrong if they don't plan on leaving it? \n\nDespite other comments, yes, he does share fault in destroying your relationship. You can't emotionally devastate your brother's gf's sister and her trust and not expect it to ripple out.

To them, ironically you're proposing to do just what Derek did - create innocent victims (your SIL and Nephew).  That your cause is just, and Derek's wasn't, doesn't change that.\n\nI'm afraid the diplomatic line would be to just say sorry, but you're not ready to forgive and forget.

For me, I can clearly see why Lisa would end things with OP over this entire situation. By the brother cheating, he created a problem that affected both families. He cheated on Carrie and most likely broke her heart. What woman would want to be ILs with the man who cheated on her sister? And none the less with ONE OF HER BEST FRIENDS?? Like come on! A lot of women I know consider their BFFs as sisters so imagine the pain Carrie felt to be betrayed by two people who she thought cared about her. Lisa probably knows the BFF pretty well considering so it\u2019s probably hurtful to see someone so close to her sister hurt her like that. And Lisa got front row tickets to this dumpster fire of a breakup. Some people have intense loyalty to their families. By hurting Carrie, the brother caused Lisa to lose respect for OP and their family. Also, if I was Lisa, I would think how future family events would work. After 7 years, I would assume maybe marriage was in the talks for them. She might of freaked at the thought of how things would turn out. By with OP, Lisa would be forcing her family and OP\u2019s family together. If they got married, both of their siblings would probably be there. Plus the cheating BFF as the brother\u2019s +1.

But they are exceedingly rare.", "He made it clear he doesn\u2019t want a relationship with his brother. His brother should accept that FULL STOP. The pushing for forgiveness is only asking for trouble for all parties.", "You need to read it again. You\u2019re referring to when he moved in with his parents in the immediate aftermath. He then moved out of state and is now recently back. Currently, he  wants nothing to do with them; however, the brother and dad tried to force a reconciliation. To be fair, the actions of the brother and his wife caused a lot of hurt to the people around them so maybe it\u2019s just karma coming back for them.", "But we\u2019re not talking about new relationship here\u2026 it was a *seven* year relationship. It doesn\u2019t make sense that she would end things solely because her sister demanded it. Maybe if that was their typical dynamic, it wouldn\u2019t be so odd. There\u2019s got to be more.", "I say that because on this sub, every time someone cheats and has a child with their affair partner, commenters lose their shit if you say anything bad about them", "That's not what's happening here.  Derek's actions messed everything up for both of them.  I know humans love the \"Do what I want as long as I'm not hurting anyone\" thing  but it's foolish to think that cheating affects only you. It doesn't. Derek's actions affected the entire dynamic for all involved.  Lisa didn't want to hurt her sister. The whole thing turned into a huge mess because he decided to be a weak-willed man.  No part of what he did was right.", "Or maybe she couldn\u2019t stand up to her sister which is its own problem", "Lisa probably didn't like being with a drama queen.", "Maybe Lisa was tired of all the drama. Wtf is with calling the bro's wife his 'mistress'?", ">Also I find it hard to believe that Lisa ended a perfectly good relationship because her sister's boyfriend was a cheater. \n\nMaybe. Or maybe she's the kind of person who chooses her family over her partner. This sub is filled with stories of people like that.\n\nIt could be that she dropped op for being op, or it could be that OP escaped a marriage with a woman who was never going to side with him over her sister.", "A 7 year relationship at that, sounds like more was going on there.", "Oh absolutely. Literally like it makes no sense if Lisa actually wanted to be with OP.", "Well shit look how vindictive and rude he is about his brother's family.

Not try to shit on you to anyone who will listen, disrespect his wife and child, blame his own pathetic failure as a man on a moment of weakness in your own life that is none of his goddamn business..\n\nIf I were OPs brother, I would not object at all to him being no contact. I would absolutely reciprocate. \n\nYTA, OP, and a failure as a brother, uncle, boyfriend, son, and decent human being.", "You grossly underestimate the influence and impact family can have on someone's decision making. Her family could have been making her life a living hell putting pressure on her to end the relationship and trying to convince her how toxic it was to the point where she actually started to see the relationship differently or valued her family to such a degree that she figured it was just smarter and easier to sacrifice the relationship with him (not married and no kids) to be able to maintain her family relationship. \n\nIt's just a matter of priorities. Just like how OP decided to basically say screw my brother I want nothing to do with him he's dead to me his ex could have said this is shitty and horrible but my sister means way too much to me to ignore this. \n\nI feel like if she had other reasons for ending the relationship she wouldn't have tried to actually make it work. She would have just ended it right away after everything blew up. It's easy to just say everyone sucks but family dynamics are complicated and messy and there are A LOT of people out there, especially younger people in their 20s, that just automatically defer to family when making decisions like this. \n\nNot saying how OP is acting now isn't childish as hell calling his brother's wife a \"mistress\" while they're married and have a kid together but you're jumping to conclusions making the assumptions you're making.", "He is not capable of thinking about anyone but himself, by my reckoning. Enormously out of line, disrespectful little shit.", ">Every time OP called her \"the mistress\" I cringed.\n\nGod yes, it's got such \"edgy teen\" energy, I really struggle to believe OP is mid-thirties.\n\nIf he wants to avoid his brother - and by extension his brother's family and their parents who are happily a part of that - he already achieved that, so he can go ahead and *un* move back there. If he wants to be a part of the family and live in the family's house, then he needs to at least feign respect for his relatives until he can get himself out of there. Brattily calling his SIL \"the mistress\" and stropping out every time another relative that's welcome in the home dares to enter is just...yuk.

The brother was a cheater but he wasnt married to carrie so by definition not a mistress situation.  OP is justified in being pissed his brother cheated on someone he cared about.

Its ridiculous to punish your brother forever over a poor decision with someone he dated years ago.", "If he was in his own place, sure. When you live in someone else's house, you don't get to decide on the guests.", "True, but he\u2019s living in his parents\u2019 home and they should be able to have their other son visit with his wife and kid without this kind of hostility. Op can plan to be out of the house for that. Or go to another part of the house or briefly acknowledge them in a civil manner.

I would argue the opposite, it is incredibly common for young people to make mistakes and the majority of them learn and grow, that\u2019s what growing up is, that\u2019s what OP has refused to do", "He shouldn\u2019t have moved back in with his parents if that was the case, that\u2019s an unreasonable expectation, his father who has allowed him to live in his house is allowed to ask whatever he would like from his son", "Not saying obviously, he was more serious than her. But some ppl really hold their family much closer to them. And wouldn't easily distance themselves.\n\nTo say she was looking for a way out, just seems like a reach with only a one-sided limited view. Why not say, Lisa probably had a gambling debt and broke it off during this same time to save OP from getting mixed up in the fallout.", "So what is it that you take OPs last condition to mean? He admits he is making their relationship as hard as possible, despite being sure they won't be divorcing/ending it.\n\nThere is no world where someone accepts that they have to badmouth their wife & ongoing marriage to appease their brother. When does that end?\n\nDoes the brother have to actively admit that he's wrong for being with his wife when they're still together in 50yrs time?\n\nHe admitted his cheating was wrong.

It\u2019s unreasonable for the father to corner OP with the brother and try to force a reconciliation.

Actions have consequences- time for the brother and parents to understand that.", "That's a stretch. Why'd she bother to try and keep it going then? People generally don't tend to just go 0-100 like that.

This is years of poison eating away at him turning him bitter and resentful.

That\u2019s a joke right?!? And just like OP can make the huge ask to move back in with his parents as an adult the father can make the huge ask for OP to speak with his brother. The only one being unreasonable is OP by asking his brother to disown his wife and damage his child.", "I hate how redditors are thinking OP is such a drama queen if I\u2019m reading this right this relationship was rather a long time right like 7 years?? I can only imagine how much of a life he tried to have with Lisa with the marriage and all. That\u2019s all gone all down the drain. Like he wanted a family with her and my only assumption was that Lisa really tried but was extremely pressured. I think her friends or family really wore her down cuz it didn\u2019t sound like it was a one and done but rather she kept trying till no more. Carrie and his brother are the major AH\u2019s to do that to OP and Lisa.\n\nI don\u2019t think ppl understand his brother definitely ducked up his life cuz of his actions.

I felt really bad for both OP and Lisa. She would've lost her whole family if she didn't break up. And the brother AND his wife are terrible people.

I mean, come ON.", "If you won\u2019t have anything to do with someone such as OP & his sister in law, you are being hostile & rude.
