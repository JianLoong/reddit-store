{"id": 29406, "submission_id": "17dgx8u", "title": "AITA for giving my brother an \"impossible\" ultimatum if he wants me back into his life?", "selftext": "I 32M was dating a girl named Lisa from 20 to 27 y.o. and my brother, Derek 35M, started dating Lisa's older sister, Carrie, a few years after  we got together. Things were good, we got all got along and I thought  Lisa would be the one I marry.\n\nWell it didn't turn out like that. Derek got caught sleeping with one of Carrie's best friends and she immediately dumped him. It was already shitty enough that my brother cheated on someone I was close to but in the aftermath there was a lot of pressure on Lisa to dump me too. Carrie was convinced I knew about the cheating, and she told Lisa she'd be a terrible sister if she forced Carrie to keep a link to Derek. So we tried to make it work but eventually Lisa did break up with me.\n\nI was devastated to lose Lisa and very bitter that I was the one who got  stuck with the short end while Derek kept his mistress and life was still intact. I moved back with my parents and made it a nightmare for  Derek or his mistress to step into the house. No matter how much my parents or Derek begged me to forgive him I refused. Eventually, I took a job in another state so I thankfully didn't see them anymore.\n\nMAYBE I could've moved on by now but Derek's made that impossible. His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't  want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\". On top of that he always blamed Lisa for ending our relationship since in his eyes she could've toughed it out if she really loved me.\n\nSince then I mostly cut him out of my life. I didn't attend his wedding, haven't met their kid until recently, etc.\n\nCurrent situation: I recently moved back home and am living with my parents until I can find my own place and as a result everyone's badgering me to make amend with Derek but I've been able to mostly avoid him.\n\nYesterday, it all came to a head when Derek came to my parents house with his mistress and infant son. To make a long evening short, I ignored them and tried to leave but he and my dad cornered me and begged me to talk to him. He said he misses me, wants me to be an uncle, and he'd do  anything to have me back in his life.\n\nAfter some thinking I came up with the following conditions\n\n1. He admits he's the reason my relationship with Lisa ended\n2. He has to accept I will never have anything to do with mistress\n3. Apologize for all the bullshit he put me through\n4. He admits his relationship with the mistress is/was wrong\n\nHe quickly accepted the first three conditions and I do think his apologies were genuine. But he refused the last condition and his mistress blew a gasket, called me all sorts of names and they left.\n\nSo that's where were at now. Him calling me an asshole for trying to shit on his relationship and me not budging, while my parents are seesawing between begging me just let it go and telling Derek to suck it up.\n\nMaybe I am the asshole since at this point I don't think they're going to  break up so all I'm doing is making their marriage harder.

You don\u2019t have to forgive your brother. If you want to carry that bitter poison and allow it to affect your life going forward, that\u2019s on you. \n\nSo, your brother is an AH and a cheater. He had to live with that not you. He wasn\u2019t married to this other woman. \n\nWas his behavior trash? Absolutely. Did he force your girlfriend to break you with you? No. Your ex and your ex\u2019s sister hold the blame for that one. \n\nYou need to move on with your life.", "YTA - no. Lisa was the reason your relationship ended. She could have found a way to make it work. Like just don\u2019t invite her sister to family events with your brother? If it was something like birthday/holidays - you can alternate or they can suck it up. It\u2019s not his fault that she dumped you.\n\nHe\u2019s married and has been with her for 5yrs and they have a child. She\u2019s not a \u201cmistress\u201d anymore. Saying that his cheating was wrong is understandable and right. But to still refer to her as that and say that their *current marriage* is wrong, is petty.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t you blaming Carrie for pressuring her sister to break up with you? Why aren\u2019t you mad at Lisa for throwing away a 7yr relationship? Are you sure she didn\u2019t actually want to break up with you anyways?", "[removed]", "YTA-\n\n>His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\".\n\nShe didn't want to split, so he cheated. Such a pathetic excuse. Just a verbal dump, even a text dumping, wouldve been a better split than him cheating on her. He also could've just stuck his neck and an say you didnt have anything to do nor any knowledge of his actions to your ex, since that was the claimed issue.\n\nBUT! While hes ofc an AH to carrie, he didnt push your gf to break up with you. His actions were simply towards carrie and carrie alone. \n\n>Carrie was convinced I knew about the cheating, and she told Lisa she'd be a terrible sister if she forced Carrie to keep a link to Derek. So we tried to make it work but eventually Lisa did break up with me.\n\nYou say yourself that Carrie is the one who was convincing Lisa. She essentially weaponized Lisas familial feelings for Carrie to turn her against you under her assumption that you knew about Dereks actions. \n\n>On top of that he always blamed Lisa for ending our relationship since in his eyes she could've toughed it out if she really loved me.\n\nHe's not entirely wrong here, in the end the only person who could make Lisa break up with you is still Lisa herself. Convinced by her sister or not, its ultimately her own decision. She couldve shut her sisters accusations towards you down had she believed you enough, or even shut it down because your relationship to her doesnt equate to what Derek did to Carrie.\n\nYour brother has a happy family now, he clearly didnt love Carrie. An found love, albeit in a horrible still fucked up fashion, with his current WIFE. Shes not a mistress, shes his first and only wife. You dont have to like her, or have anything to do with her. You dont have to like him or how he got with her. But you cant blame him for lisa dumping you. \n\nYour feelings on this matter is displaced bitter resentment that you've allowed to grow and fester. And its because you don't believe he or she deserve to be happy when you arent anymore.", "YTA. \n\nSix or so years ago your long-term girlfriend dumped you because her sister pressured her and made up lies about you knowing that your brother was cheating on his less long-term girlfriend. Since then your brother has gotten married and has a child. His WIFE is not his mistress and their relationship is not wrong. She never was his mistress since he and Carrie were never married. They were dating. Still not okay for him to cheat, but you are making it out like they were on their way to the alter. \n\nThis is a you and Lisa issue. Your brother owes you nothing. He is not responsible for Lisa looking for a way out.", "YTA.  She is not his mistress, she is his wife.  And they have a child.

Yes.\n\nThat being said you just want him to leave you alone and you've made that more than clear\n\nAlso\n\n>His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\".\n\nThe fuck?

He admits his relationship with the mistress is/was wrong\n\nDude, let it go. What are you, Carrie's lawyer?  He married this woman and has a child with her. Stop trying to break them up just because you're hurt that a girlfriend dumped you . . .what, five years ago?\n\nWhen did this", "YTA.  You are holding it against your brother for something that your ex did.  If she wanted you that much, she would have stood up for you, not bowed to peer pressure from her sister.  Look how easy you cut off your brother?", "NTA, I don't tolerate this behavior. Just because he's family doesn't mean you have to give in. He's an ass and he didn't apologize. If it were me, I would never have moved back home. \n\nPeople will say he's family. But I believe that if you have family that treats you badly or won't admit to what he did wrong, it makes it worse. Family doesn't mean you have to tolerate being treated like he did. If he cared, he would have told Lisa you didn't know. He didn't, and that tells me how much he cares about you. In fact, I would have him tell Lisa now that you didn't know. I'm sure many will disagree, and if they think family has a right to treat you like crap and that you should tolerate it, it shows you how they really feel about the concept of family.", "NTA. no one is obligated a relationship. and these are your conditions for this one. he was old enough to know cheating is wrong.", "ESH You need therapy to get over Lisa. You are blaming your brother, who is TA, for Lisa breaking up with you when in all reality she is a grown woman who made the decision to do so. No one held a gun to her head. Your brother could have simply broken up with his ex instead of sleeping with someone else. He is a coward. Stop blaming your brother\u2019s WIFE. She is not his mistress. He married her. You are taking your grief over your relationship with your ex out on her. She never forced your brother. She didn\u2019t force your ex to break up with you. She\u2019s an AH for messing with someone involved with someone else. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t have to like her or have a relationship with her but she is not the devil incarnate. For the record, your brother\u2019s relationship with his wife is not wrong. He didn\u2019t commit adultery on his ex. You will never be at peace in your life until you seek help to rid you of this anger.", "I keep looking at this story and I think what's really making OP bitter is that the only one who seems to have gotten the short end of the stick is him, as he said. \n\nOP dates someone for close to a decade. OP's brother comes and starts dating his GF's sister for a couple of years. Brother decided to cheat, imploding the preexisting relationship OP had with his GF. Why did the brother cheat? \"It's her fault, because she wouldn't break up with me otherwise.\" \n\nOP has to move back in with his parents, which I assume is due to having to find a new place after breaking up with his girlfriend. Family immediately starts pressuring OP to forgive his brother and get over it to the point he leaves the state to get away. \n\nMeanwhile? Brother gets parental support. Brother gets a baby with his cheating partner. Brother gets married. Brother gets parents once again cornering and harassing OP about how he's being a jerk to \"poor poor\" brother. Brother is living happily ever after and OP got all the consequences.\n\nI think ESH, but damn, I sorta feel bad for OP. He's never been given any time to process having his world fall apart so he'd be less bitter because everyone else is focused on making the brother comfortable. His only time to process was after getting to the point he had to leave his whole family to get peace. Which probably just made the whole thing fester even worse.\n\nOP if your brother makes you that unhappy don't be around him. If your parents are going to keep pushing you to be friendly with him, you're going to have to let them go too.", "Interesting.  Seems like this is the exception to the usual Reddit response of \u201cGo NC or LC, when a family sides with the Cheater & their Affair Partner (better than Mistress?).  \n\nThis time, many here saying OP should just \u201cget over it\u201d & freaking out over using the term \u201cmistress\u201d.  Makes me wonder if it\u2019s because the hurt party is a GUY.\n\nYes, OP has some misplaced anger but he\u2019s not an A H. His Brother\u2019s cheating set a series of events in motion that hurt him but his feelings have been minimized and dismissed by his entire family.\n\nOP should get personal therapy in order to move on & find his own happiness, for himself.

He was a coward who blamed everyone but himself. If he wanted to leave, he could've just left. He didn't need to hurt someone so horribly. Carrie lost a bf AND a close friend in the process. No one deserves that. The wife was one of Carrie's best friends. She threw away a friendship with someone she was close to and was trusted, by sleeping with her boyfriend. Low caliber people. Honestly, you don't need either of them in your life. You may need to seek some therapy, but don't put yourself in a situation where being near them causes you pain.

Brother still pressures him into a maintaining a relationship but utterly ignores any damage he has done. \n\nThe problem I have here with people is that the OP needing therapy doesn't make him an asshole, the fact he is told why and he is bitter about it doesn't make him an asshole and being angry for loosing someone who cared about because of a family member doesn't make him an asshole. \n\nHe is allowed to hold bitter feelings toward his brother and he's literally allowed to even imply tha the can't afford therapy because he had to move back home!

Things were good, we got all got along and I thought  Lisa would be the one I marry.\n\nWell it didn't turn out like that. Derek got caught sleeping with one of Carrie's best friends and she immediately dumped him. It was already shitty enough that my brother cheated on someone I was close to but in the aftermath there was a lot of pressure on Lisa to dump me too. Carrie was convinced I knew about the cheating, and she told Lisa she'd be a terrible sister if she forced Carrie to keep a link to Derek. So we tried to make it work but eventually Lisa did break up with me.\n\nI was devastated to lose Lisa and very bitter that I was the one who got  stuck with the short end while Derek kept his mistress and life was still intact. I moved back with my parents and made it a nightmare for  Derek or his mistress to step into the house. No matter how much my parents or Derek begged me to forgive him I refused. Eventually, I took a job in another state so I thankfully didn't see them anymore.\n\nMAYBE I could've moved on by now but Derek's made that impossible. His excuse was that he wanted out from his relationship with Carrie and she didn't  want that so getting her to dump him was his \"only option\". On top of that he always blamed Lisa for ending our relationship since in his eyes she could've toughed it out if she really loved me.\n\nSince then I mostly cut him out of my life. I didn't attend his wedding, haven't met their kid until recently, etc.\n\nCurrent situation: I recently moved back home and am living with my parents until I can find my own place and as a result everyone's badgering me to make amend with Derek but I've been able to mostly avoid him.\n\nYesterday, it all came to a head when Derek came to my parents house with his mistress and infant son. To make a long evening short, I ignored them and tried to leave but he and my dad cornered me and begged me to talk to him. He said he misses me, wants me to be an uncle, and he'd do  anything to have me back in his life.\n\nAfter some thinking I came up with the following conditions\n\n1. He admits he's the reason my relationship with Lisa ended\n2. He has to accept I will never have anything to do with mistress\n3. Apologize for all the bullshit he put me through\n4. He admits his relationship with the mistress is/was wrong\n\nHe quickly accepted the first three conditions and I do think his apologies were genuine. But he refused the last condition and his mistress blew a gasket, called me all sorts of names and they left.\n\nSo that's where were at now. Him calling me an asshole for trying to shit on his relationship and me not budging, while my parents are seesawing between begging me just let it go and telling Derek to suck it up.\n\nMaybe I am the asshole since at this point I don't think they're going to  break up so all I'm doing is making their marriage harder.

It is not reasonable at all for her sister to expect her to break up with you because your brother did something shitty. I am astounded that she actually did. But listen dude, that isn't your brother's fault. Your ex made a very bizarre choice there. Yes, it only happened because of what your brother did, but he didn't directly cause it. My thinking is that, maybe she just wasn't very invested in the relationship anyway, to have broken up so easily. It's a bit of a headscratcher.\n\nYour blaming your brother for destroying your relationship is unjust, IMHO, and your treatment of him since then is likewise not good. Do you think he imagined that his actions would ruin your relationship? Who would?

While his brother's behaviour was terrible, it's also on Lisa that she did not choose the relationship ultimately. Life sucks. Sometimes the people we love will take decisions that don't include us. I feel for OP but he really does need to process his emotions about it and move on. He doesn't have to be super enthusiastic about his brother's wife or their marriage, but being insulting to SIL is AH behaviour. Their relationship may have begun as a result of cheating, but Carrie is long gone, brother is married and  they have a kid now.\n\nEven if they *were* to break up, as OP seems to have hoped , SIL is the mom of OP's nephew. She'll always be connected to the family. Breaking them up will probably just cause a lot more pain for everyone in the family. OP needs to figure out if his (very real) pain is worth creating more. \n\nThings *have* changed and OP needs to accept that. \n\nSoft YTA because it's really difficult to process this sort of thing and because I can't tell whether the brother is being egregiously entitled or pushing himself onto OP, or whether his actions are normal for someone who made such a big mistake in the past but is protecting his family now (seen through OP's negative lens).", "YTA.

For reasons many have pointed out including:\n\n* Lisa dumped you because of pressure from her sister. \n\n* Derrick never had a mistress and regardless, she is now his wife. They have a kid together who is your nephew. \n\n* Your demands are petty, unreasonable and insulting. \n\n* You\u2019re living with your parents and making their lives difficult. \n\n* You should consider therapy and not Reddit. \n\nLisa and Carrie are gone from both of your lives. You can continue along this path but eventually, your entire family just gets sick of listening to you whining about that one girl that dumped you because she had no backbone and her sister was manipulative. When that happens they stop inviting you to family events or special occasions, then they just stop all contact. \n\nYour brother made a slight error in judgement in starting another relationship before ending his current one but we all make mistakes. He could have been much stronger in actually dumping Carrie but he wasn\u2019t.\n\nOne day, your parents will both be gone and the only immediate family you have will be your brother and you\u2019ll need that relationship more than you think you will.", "Yta.

You just come across as being in denial over the actual role you played in your own breakup. Maybe stop blaming everyone else and do some work on yourself/move on.", "ESH. Will go against the tide here with no. 4, their relationship WAS wrong as your brother specifically said that he cheated as a way to get out of his relationship which besides being a coward move, cause someone hurt.

Maybe try therapy first before forcing an apology.", "OP, I absolutely guarantee that Derek's cheating was not the only reason that Lisa broke up with you!  Of course breakups usually involve a \"last straw\", and the drama with her sister may have indeed been the last straw, but that straw wouldn't have \"broken the camel's back\" unless there were also a billion other \"straws\" eroding your relationship over time.\n\nLook at yourself, and how you treat the people in your life, including your own parents, before you think of Derek again.  Are you always kind and reasonable?  Were you always kind and reasonable to Lisa?  Are you being kind and reasonable towards your infant nibling?

They are obviously right for each other, and Carrie wasn\u2019t. His cheating was not the reason Lisa dumped you. I think you have to realize that, after 7 years together, she may have also wanted an out and her sister gave her the perfect reason. If Lisa truly loved you, she wouldn\u2019t have dumped you over her sister. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me to find out that the only one who hasn\u2019t moved on is YOU.

This is all on Lisa, you dodged a bullet.", "ESH Your last point is stupid. Why would you expect any married person to admit their own relationship is wrong if they don't plan on leaving it? \n\nDespite other comments, yes, he does share fault in destroying your relationship. You can't emotionally devastate your brother's gf's sister and her trust and not expect it to ripple out.

To them, ironically you're proposing to do just what Derek did - create innocent victims (your SIL and Nephew).  That your cause is just, and Derek's wasn't, doesn't change that.\n\nI'm afraid the diplomatic line would be to just say sorry, but you're not ready to forgive and forget.

And the brother is also their son, his wife is their daughter in law and the baby is their grandchild. They shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this when Derek and his family visit. Op could arrange to not be home. Or to stay in another part of the home or to civilly acknowledge them.  If he can\u2019t manage any of those, it becomes a problem\n\nETA the parents are also ahs for trying to make them play happy families.  I went with ESH as my judgement, but I should have added that as well.  \n\nOp moved initially to get away from the parents too.  There\u2019s no indication his parents have changed so why have a long term stay?  Is there a financial hardship issue?", "OP is pushing, he is actively trying to make his brother life hell, intentionally trying to ruin his relationship, which would damage an innocent child, this is soooo much worse than brother ruin his own relationship", "100% agree. For me, I can clearly see why Lisa would end things with OP over this entire situation. By the brother cheating, he created a problem that affected both families. He cheated on Carrie and most likely broke her heart. What woman would want to be ILs with the man who cheated on her sister? And none the less with ONE OF HER BEST FRIENDS?? Like come on! A lot of women I know consider their BFFs as sisters so imagine the pain Carrie felt to be betrayed by two people who she thought cared about her. Lisa probably knows the BFF pretty well considering so it\u2019s probably hurtful to see someone so close to her sister hurt her like that. And Lisa got front row tickets to this dumpster fire of a breakup. Some people have intense loyalty to their families. By hurting Carrie, the brother caused Lisa to lose respect for OP and their family. Also, if I was Lisa, I would think how future family events would work. After 7 years, I would assume maybe marriage was in the talks for them. She might of freaked at the thought of how things would turn out. By with OP, Lisa would be forcing her family and OP\u2019s family together. If they got married, both of their siblings would probably be there. Plus the cheating BFF as the brother\u2019s +1. If OP and Lisa stayed together and/or had a child, Carrie would be forced to see the brother and his new family for the rest of her life.", "The brother is absolutely the asshole of the original situation, but the OP is the AH now.

Just like how OP decided to basically say screw my brother I want nothing to do with him he's dead to me his ex could have said this is shitty and horrible but my sister means way too much to me to ignore this. \n\nI feel like if she had other reasons for ending the relationship she wouldn't have tried to actually make it work. She would have just ended it right away after everything blew up. It's easy to just say everyone sucks but family dynamics are complicated and messy and there are A LOT of people out there, especially younger people in their 20s, that just automatically defer to family when making decisions like this. \n\nNot saying how OP is acting now isn't childish as hell calling his brother's wife a \"mistress\" while they're married and have a kid together but you're jumping to conclusions making the assumptions you're making.", "He is not capable of thinking about anyone but himself, by my reckoning.

If they had any degree of remorse for what they did or how it affected others, they'd have apologised on their own.\n\nEven now, I get the impression that the brother is still passing it off as somehow being Carrie's fault; that she \"wouldn't let him\" break up with her, or something? So he just *had* to cheat in order to force her into initiating the break-up, obviously. /s\n\nObviously, I agree that OP has taken this way too far, and that he probably should have tried to move on by now. But claiming he's the only AH in this situation is just plain wrong. It's an obvious ESH for me; OP for taking it too far for too long, his brother (and his now-wife) for obvious reasons (some of them outlined in this post), Carrie for holding OP responsible for someone else's actions, and Lisa for not standing up to her sister's AH-ness.\n\nOf course, this is all assuming that OP's description of the events is even remotely accurate.", "thats just the bit he went to far imo. the relationship *was* wrong when the woman was still his mistress. but now she is his wife, and despite how much of AHs they've started their relationship, it is not wrong anymore.", "Because he\u2019s in his parent\u2019s home! Ignore the brother in your own house.", "Oh yeah that poor women who betrayed her best friend to sleep with/steal her boyfriend\u2026 huh?", ">five years of stable monogamous relationship\n\nthat's assuming a lot lol.", "This may be true in many relationships, but painting a broad brush like this is incredibly damaging for people stuck in abusive relationships or who have a history of abusive relationships.", "Exactly. Your sister (and possibly other family members) telling you almost saily that your boyfriend knew his brother was cheating, is likely to cheat, and is lying to you will seriously mess with your head and make you paranoid. The brother really created that situation with his actions.", "LOL, glad I'm not the only one who finds this utterly bizarre and antiquated.", "Right? Imagine co-parenting with this guy somewhere down the line after a divorce.", "Fair enough my mistake and I\u2019m not young\u2026but 30 is not too old to learn and grow from your mistakes, seems like brother may have", "It would have been awkward in the long run. She would have always hated her BIL and they would never have got along especially as he stayed with the woman he cheated on her sister with. The situation would be worse than what it is like now with OP and his brother.", " Drama king. Lisa's sister was the drama queen. She shouldn't have pressured Lisa to end her relationship.", "It\u2019s time to stop", "Family and friend pressure can be intense, but real love would endure.\n\nFor real, if Lisa truly wanted to be OP she would moved to where he did. Or she would have stayed with him and endured the family fallout. So many people bank on marriage and kids to eventually soften the family\u2019s hard stance on rifts because it often works. The grandparents will want to know the grandkids. Lisa would not have the wedding she envisioned, but could have eloped with OP and continued to insist he\u2019s not like his brother. If they wanted a family together, that starts with being a family unit with her spouse. Eventually the parents likely would have relented, Carrie would take a longer time to come around but when she found her person and was long over OP\u2019s brother eventually may have thawed.\n\nBut instead Lisa decided life would be easier without OP and her family being upset about them being together. That\u2019s what it comes down to. It\u2019s OP\u2019s first love but not the great love of his life if she was able to walk away. It\u2019s been FIVE years and she hasn\u2019t reached out. She may be married to another guy by now, as would be her choice.", "He was trying to leave the dad cornered him, did you read the post? I think thats pretty reasonable response because he isn't stopping them from visiting", "But their problem is not OP's presence but his brother wants to have a relationship with him. He wants him to be his son's uncle and etc. I guess if he lives somewhere else. They would not have the chance to ask him that and no conflict? Is that what you're saying?", "It\u2019s sad. I understand his anger but it feels like he just stopped developing at that point. Like everything for the rest of his life is going to be \u201cwell yeah but bro cheated on my girlfriend\u2019s sister!\u201d", "It maybe goes against the rules here, but I think the brother's ah-ness has long expired. It was e s h, but now it's just op being a AH.", "I won\u2019t disagree with anything you said except your judgment. This is a textbook case of ESH. And by Everybody Sucks Here, I mean EVERYBODY", "What are you saying here?  \u201cUnder my roof you will pretend to forgive your brother!\u201d.  OPs brother needs to stop demanding forgiveness because that\u2019s not how you get it.", "Yeah it's a shitty thing to do, but how long is OP going to keep this tantrum going?", "Maybe, but we've no evidence to suggest contrary, and there's no doubt OP would present literally anything he had to slander them.", "The fact that he cornered OOP with his Dad when he wanted to leave and basically tried to force himself to forgive him and accept his relationship with his now wife when he knew OOP was still hurting shows to me that he really didn't.", "And he hasn't found anyone else since then. \n\nI agree with everyone else who talks about his shitty character and the ridiculousness of calling the OP's wife his \"mistress.\"\n\nSheesh. Sure, ESH -- but I feel most annoyed with the OP.", "And a perpetual victim.", "Why?\n\nOp didn't cheat on Carrie. OPs brother did.", "This wasn't some guy she hooked up with for a few weeks. They dated 7 Years. If Lisa wasn't already looking for an out, she'd have told her family where to stick it.", "I mean, if I was genuinely in love with someone, I think I could stomach some initial awkward family meals for it. The alternative is a weird, ugly oblivion where I'm prioritizing \"a slightly more breezy dinner environment here and there\" over my ultimate happiness. That's insane. \n\nAlso, that kind of awkwardness usually fades.", "He can dislike his brother all he wants, he can separate himself from his brother all he wants. \n\nOP cannot live in his parent\u2019s house and make it uncomfortable for his own parents to see their child and grandchild. He doesn\u2019t control the guest list and he certainly shouldn\u2019t be acting rude, when we himself is a guest.", "Really frustrating seeing someone make a bad breakup their entire personality\n\n30years from now they're gonna see each other again at a funeral or some shit and ops gonna be making snide comments about mistresses and his good for nothing brother while his great-niblings roll their eyes at cranky uncle and make idk augmented reality memes about it", "Why is there so many cheater defenders in these comments??? Shits CRAZYY", "I\u2019m not defending the cheaters. I\u2019m defending the right of the parents to have visitors, including their daughter in law and grandson, without this level of drama.  Though they are to blame for the most recent incident for trying to force happy families \n\nOp moved away to get away from his parents as well as his brother.  He didn\u2019t indicate anything had changed in the family dynamic. So why even stay with his parents in the first place?  Here are some of the alternatives:\n\nStay with a friend or a relative who understands the situation better \n\nAirbnb\n\nMonth to month lease if available \n\nLong stay hotel\n\nUnless there\u2019s some sort of extreme financial hardship, why even put yourself through people who are going to try the happy families stuff. \n\nI hope he doesn\u2019t call the nephew the affair baby the way he calls his sister in law the mistress", "It takes loads of mental gymnastics to move from \u201cOP is being an AH for how he is dragging this out, his demands are unreasonable and childish, and brother is now married with a child\u201d to \u201ccheater defenders\u201d.", "I think it\u2019s fair for his parents to say, \u201cit\u2019s been years. You live here, and he comes to visit. It\u2019s time to get over it.\u201d \n\nAnd in this case, the \u201cunder my roof\u201d applies because OP doesn\u2019t have to live there.", "Yes he's going  to be hurting that pore inocent  child", "I agree, the OP is a real asshole for this.", "Seriously keep staring at that (32M) in absolute consternation. If that said 12M I'd still be thinking someone needs to step in and tell him to quit being a little brat. \n\nSHE BROKE UP WITH YOU DUDE. and judging by how much of an insufferable petty goober op seems to be I'm guessing it's not because his brother cheated on his gfs sister...like this is so obviously not about the brother at this point but he really can't seem to accept that", "This slapped my funny bone hard.", "Or he'll run into Lisa who'll be \"oh I had a hundred reasons to dump you. That just seemed the easiest to get you out the door\"", "Because it was ages ago and the \"cheaters\" are now married with a child.", "If cheating was a crime, how long in prison would you recommend it deserves?\n\nBecause OP is talking about something that happened at least 5 years ago. (OP was dating gf until he was 27 and is now 32). Do you genuinely not think there is any way to 'rehabilitate' a cheater. In, again I stress, FIVE YEARS?! The brother is now married with a kid and has shown zero signs of cheating at least from what we're told. Do you think maybe he deserves to be considered something other than just a cheater?\n\nIs it really defending cheating to suggest maybe it doesn't deserve lifetime punishment from OP? At the very least, he needs to stop making things difficult because the parents ain't going to abandon their other son and grandchild. So he either plays nice in the family home or GTFO.", ">\u201cit\u2019s been years. You live here, and he comes to visit. It\u2019s time to get over it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not how reality works.

It\u2019s unreasonable for the father and brother to continuously pester OP into reconciliation. The answer is clearly no. It kind of seems like OP gave his brother impossible conditions because he literally doesn\u2019t want a relationship with him. Guess the brother shouldn\u2019t have forced OP into a conversation that OP made clear he didn\u2019t want to have.", "They still didn't do anything to them. She chose her family over him. It could have been any situation, and she would have probably still chosen her family.", "Amen. Maybe that makes me a lesser person, but if one of my brothers did that shit, I'd be just as if not MORE vindictive. So many people have a hardon for the concept of grace and forgiveness.", "Time for therapy. He may never like his SIL but he can learn to be civil. Get over the past. Lisa is gone.", "You\u2019re as dramatic as OP lol\n\nIt\u2019s been 5 years. It is not unreasonable for his parents to want to create a welcome environment for ALL of their children, which includes his brother. If OP is a part of the reason why that environment is unwelcome they can ask him to fix it. \n\nIt\u2019s their house. He\u2019s an adult. Not a teenager. His parents are well within their right (and they have not) to ask him not to be rude to their other child. \n\nBtw, as someone who does suffer from bouts of depression. It is unreasonable to ask someone not to be sad. But it is not unreasonable to ask someone to go get help to help mitigate the situation or learn coping mechanisms. No it doesn\u2019t always work, but sitting there being sad is not a viable solution. It\u2019s been years and OP is still sitting here upset about a situation that everyone has moved on from because he hasn\u2019t done any inner work."]}
