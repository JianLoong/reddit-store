{"id": 18466, "submission_id": "13uuyum", "title": "AITA for making a joke about my GF's Mum being lazy?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I (35M) live with my GF (31F) and her parents (65M and 64F) in a house that my GF was apparently strongarmed into buying (I wasn't there so don't want to make too many judgements on this) by her parents 3 years ago when their business went south and they were worried they wouldn't have anywhere to live\n\nAt the time she bought the house my GF and I were looking at moving in together anyway (we were both renting separately) and she said she realised it wasn't ideal for me to live with her parents so she'd be happy for us to rent somewhere else to live, but the mortgage on the new house was the top of what she could afford so I'd have to pay for the whole rental. To get a rental she liked would have meant me spending 3x what I was used to paying, so I said no and moved in to her house\n\nI work full time and pay what full market rent would be for a room in her house. Her parents haven't worked since moving in, apart from about a brief time where one of my GF's friends got her Mum a job in a supermarket, which she quit after about 4 weeks because apparently the manager was abusive (again I wasn't there so not going to judge). I see her Dad apply for jobs and get rejected (I assume because of his age), but her Mum doesn't do anything from what I can see\n\nThey do very little around the house in terms of cooking, cleaning, etc. I'm not saying they should, but if I lived somewhere rent free somewhere my daughter paid for, she wouldn't have to lift a finger around the house. Maybe that's just me\n\nI sympathise with her Dad - it's clear he hates being unemployed, so I spoke to them about starting a mobile business for them. I made a quick website, no startup cost other than hosting and insurance, which I paid, and it's starting to take off. Her Dad is working hard in the business, her Mum has refused to help in any way\n\nYesterday my GF made a throwaway comment about how she hopes she has her Mum's figure when she's that age, and how her Mum has the arse of a 21 year old. I said I couldn't comment as she's not been off it for 3 years, so I can't remember what it looks like \n\nMy GF is now upset with me and says I should be more respectful about her Mum. I feel I put up with a lot. It's not easy to be 35M and live with your in-laws for 3yrs. I'm polite to them every time I see them, and I think I'm entitled to the emotional release of the odd joke about it here and there.

Face it mate, you live together, your ass needs to contribute to the bills too.  Sounds like the negotiation for how much you would contribute was based on fair market value of rent in the area, instead of say, 50% (or more?) of the cost of the place monthly, so that you were not actually paying for your \"in laws\" portion of upkeep on the house and bills.\n\nYOU chose to move into your GF's house knowing full well that her parents, who are retirement age, had no income due to loss of jobs from COVID.  \n\nHelping her dad was a really cool and nice thing to do.

I'm from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background where it would have been easy to just sit around all day and let other people fund my life like so many people around me growing up.\n\nMy family worked really hard to instill in me that that's not the way to behave. If I was struggling to find work and living rent-free with relatives, I'd be out 8 hours a day collecting cans, and my cooking and cleaning would make Cinderella look like a lazy bi-atch.\n\nI'm not saying GF's parents should go to those lengths, but they could at least pick up a saucepan or a sponge once in a while.

I\u2019m sorry.", "I get that, I guess to me it would be you and her paying similar amounts to be fair, but her parents should be too so I see your point. Clearly I didn't think that one through very thoroughly haha", "Thanks Einstein. You have informed me that a tenant is somebody who pays rent. And that it is up to them what decisions they make. \n\nOK but my snarkyness aside. This is a place where uninformed strangers make judgements.", "I dont know all the details of your circumstances.\n\nBut I have had friends and family in similiar circumstances. Generally, the homeowner doesnt want to share ownership, becuase it gives them more security. However, their partner is then left without any. They can have a relationship for 5 years, and then get tossed away.\n\nEven without rent payments, it's still a commitment to stay with someone for years. At 20 years old, that's fine. But I think at 35, commitment and security are essential.\n\nFrom one internet stranger to another, I sincerely hope that you are protecting yourself from getting screwed the way i have seen other people get screwed. And i wish the best for you.", "And my judgement is OP has no right to equity in a home where he did not contribute to the down payment and shares none of the risks of homeownership. He is not responsible for any maintenance, repairs or replacement when needed. Furnace needs replacement? That's on GF. Same with everything else! He is not liable if someone is injured on the property. He has not risk if there is a natural disaster happens and insurance inevitably doesn't cover the full replacement costs. \n\nI'm just tired of people believing they should have equity in a property for which they have no responsibility for and no personal risk. \n\nI do agree that if OP doesn't like the current arrangement, he is free to leave.", "good to know, thank you. Could you elaborate on how they run into difficulty? I'd like to make sure I'm protecting myself", "A truly uninformed judgement. I like it.", "Simply that the clock is ticking to start a family. You dont want to end up 40yo single and without a house. By 'getting screwed' i mean wasting your time.\n\nIf you dont care about having a family, and just want to drift around, then fine. You do you. I dont know what you want.\n\nBut if you're looking for a family, or a long-term relationship with a self-sufficient life, then you deserve commitment, clarity and security. Now."]}
