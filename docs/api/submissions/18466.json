To get a rental she liked would have meant me spending 3x what I was used to paying, so I said no and moved in to her house\n\nI work full time and pay what full market rent would be for a room in her house. Her parents haven't worked since moving in, apart from about a brief time where one of my GF's friends got her Mum a job in a supermarket, which she quit after about 4 weeks because apparently the manager was abusive (again I wasn't there so not going to judge). I see her Dad apply for jobs and get rejected (I assume because of his age), but her Mum doesn't do anything from what I can see\n\nThey do very little around the house in terms of cooking, cleaning, etc. I'm not saying they should, but if I lived somewhere rent free somewhere my daughter paid for, she wouldn't have to lift a finger around the house. Maybe that's just me\n\nI sympathise with her Dad - it's clear he hates being unemployed, so I spoke to them about starting a mobile business for them. I made a quick website, no startup cost other than hosting and insurance, which I paid, and it's starting to take off. Her Dad is working hard in the business, her Mum has refused to help in any way\n\nYesterday my GF made a throwaway comment about how she hopes she has her Mum's figure when she's that age, and how her Mum has the arse of a 21 year old. I said I couldn't comment as she's not been off it for 3 years, so I can't remember what it looks like \n\nMy GF is now upset with me and says I should be more respectful about her Mum. I feel I put up with a lot. It's not easy to be 35M and live with your in-laws for 3yrs.

It sounds like your girlfriend has made choices about the way she wants to live her life that you don\u2019t approve of.

Don\u2019t get me wrong here. I pass no judgement on either set of values. In fact, I also don\u2019t value financially or physically caring for aging parents. It\u2019s not in my culture and it\u2019s not part of my personal values. But I didn\u2019t move in with someone who holds that value dear to their heart. You did.

She wants you to pay her mortgage and provide for her and her parents. Do you plan on marriage and children? All living in one house with the folks? \n\n5. Reevaluate.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to be passive aggressive about something the rest of the household might be okay with. Maybe the mom did the most work in the beginning of their marriage, or did all the childrearing alone, or is from a culture where it\u2019s not common for the women to work and/or parents are more taken care of by their kids when they grow older. You said that you work 6 days a week. Maybe her mom helps her in ways that are not very visible but important to your girlfriend and not so much to you? Idk man, I feel like it\u2019s something you could discuss, but this is definitely not the way.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your home and they\u2019re not your parents and you knew the situation going in. \n\nYou don\u2019t \u201cput up\u201d with anything because it\u2019s not your home. Nor was it bought with the intention of being a joint home. It was bought for her and her parents to have somewhere to live. \n\nBut also the comment was just immature and pointless. If you\u2019re unhappy with the living situation, be an adult and have a conversation with her about it. Throwing shade at your girlfriend\u2019s mom because you\u2019re too scared and childish to have an actual conversation with your girlfriend is incredibly lame.", "ESH, mostly YTA. they\u2019re retiring age and they lost their business. yes they should help around the house, but complaining about them not working is weird. instead of making rude comments about your partner\u2019s mother, speak up. communicate. don\u2019t come to reddit to complain instead of actually sitting down and having a conversation. you chose to move in, if you don\u2019t like it, move out.", "Lol-maybe the Ah but I still on your side. She should be keeping the place spic and span. What does she do all day?", "NTA.  Unless mom is disabled, she needs to pay her share and do her share of the house work.  Even if she really can't get any job, why can't she do most of the cleaning and cooking, so that's she's contributing?  I would give her a deadline to get her act together or move out.", "I don't really have a judgment. The situation sucks and of course you're entitled to your frustration, but it doesn't sound like your partner is open to hearing jokes about her mom. Maybe vent to your friends, and start working on future plans with your partner. Good luck!", "YTA not for being upset at the situation or even the joke but 100% for being passive aggressive. Tell your partner your unhappy with the situation and work together to fix it", "Leave", "NTA. It was a joke. I laughed. Thanks for that.", "ESH. \n\nYou shouldn't have made that comment as it was very disrespectful, your GF needs to take off the rose-colored glasses about her mom, and your GF's mom needs to step up and actually do something, *anything*, other than sit around. It could be helping around the house, it could be getting a job.", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend chose to help out her parents and her purchase of a house and corresponding mortgage and bills are, at least partially, in pursuit of that end. You are under no obligation to support this, but it sounds like you put up with it and pay more than your share. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the other 2 adults that live there to contribute in some way as well. \n\nAlso, the joke was hilarious. Your GF brought up her Mom's ass, not you. You just rolled with it. \n\nIn all honesty, you would be well advised to have a think about your life priorities right now, discuss them with your GF, and consider moving out.", "NTA\n\nPeople don't like hearing the truth", "NTA.\nBut it's a symptom of something that'll grow , right?\nWhat's the plan to be out of this situation?", "NTA. But, that's the kind of joke that will seriously interrupt your sex life for a while.", "Probably yta as gf didnt appreciate the \"your mum\" joke but also I found that hilarious.", "NTA.\n\nI would say Y T A for the joke, but this isn't really about the joke. Sounds like you're being fleeced. \"Move in with me and my parents while paying me rent and doing chores, or I move in with you while paying nothing.\" \n\nwhat benefits do you get from living with her? Because it sounds like you get more chores, still have to pay rent, likely more bills, and less freedom.", "Plenty of retired people would still help where they can with housework if they were living with their adult child for free.", "Why not? Sounds like he's done quite a bit to help them out? The father is working a lot to try and get the business OP started for them and the mother is doing sod all. I hope she heard it.", "She was complimenting her mother, he put her mother down, while living in her house. It's not his house and no court would issue it as being his house. You don't get to claim ownership over an apartment you rent, even though your rent pays the mortgage of the property.", "It's a good joke but it's understandable that your gf would be offended.", "You could rent a place for your in-laws and get them to move out.", "God, that's the best variation on when hell freezes over I've heard in a hot second.", "Stop \ud83d\ude39. You crack me up. NTA.", "I didn't see him claiming ownership anywhere in the post. I see him being frustrated that his girlfriend's mom is taking advantage of said girlfriend."]}
