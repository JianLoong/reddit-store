To get a rental she liked would have meant me spending 3x what I was used to paying, so I said no and moved in to her house\n\nI work full time and pay what full market rent would be for a room in her house. Her parents haven't worked since moving in, apart from about a brief time where one of my GF's friends got her Mum a job in a supermarket, which she quit after about 4 weeks because apparently the manager was abusive (again I wasn't there so not going to judge). I see her Dad apply for jobs and get rejected (I assume because of his age), but her Mum doesn't do anything from what I can see\n\nThey do very little around the house in terms of cooking, cleaning, etc. I'm not saying they should, but if I lived somewhere rent free somewhere my daughter paid for, she wouldn't have to lift a finger around the house. Maybe that's just me\n\nI sympathise with her Dad - it's clear he hates being unemployed, so I spoke to them about starting a mobile business for them. I made a quick website, no startup cost other than hosting and insurance, which I paid, and it's starting to take off. Her Dad is working hard in the business, her Mum has refused to help in any way\n\nYesterday my GF made a throwaway comment about how she hopes she has her Mum's figure when she's that age, and how her Mum has the arse of a 21 year old. I said I couldn't comment as she's not been off it for 3 years, so I can't remember what it looks like \n\nMy GF is now upset with me and says I should be more respectful about her Mum. I feel I put up with a lot. It's not easy to be 35M and live with your in-laws for 3yrs.

It sounds like your girlfriend has made choices about the way she wants to live her life that you don\u2019t approve of.

Don\u2019t get me wrong here. I pass no judgement on either set of values. In fact, I also don\u2019t value financially or physically caring for aging parents. It\u2019s not in my culture and it\u2019s not part of my personal values. But I didn\u2019t move in with someone who holds that value dear to their heart. You did.

I still appreciate the reminder to stay vigilant.", "He says she bought it three years ago and he wasn't around then. It sure didn't sound like they'd been together all that time but even if they were...she has a house and a good relationship with her parents.\n\nThat's way too valuable to screw with for a tenant/\"boyfriend\". \n\nHe could do very well in this situation or he can get salty.", "It does add a certain bit of class, but it is something that I see most when I read stuff from Britain.", "Yeah, the first paragraph makes it sound like they weren\u2019t together at the time she bought it. But the second paragraph says they were. I think he just meant he wasn\u2019t there for the interactions between the gf and the parents when she was buying the house.

I mean a house is like gold to most millennials and I'm guessing they're at the late end of gen z?\n\nBut no matter what generation you don't let someone disrespect your mom, who you love and who made you who you are or your dad but... there's definitely something special about a person willing to talk shit about your mom. Especially if you weren't shit talking first but either way really.", "Nothing. Was just a joke about how we all argue defiantly about a circumstance we know little to nothing about.

Are their health issues?  \n\nWhy is your girlfriend ok with it?  Is she submissive to her parents?\n\nYou do need the emotional release but doing it in that way is only going to lead to grief.  This is an unfair living arrangement if there is one person who isn't contributing any value while all the other people are.  \n\nYou don't have a history of being cared for and raised by this person like your girlfriend does.  So she will of course have more loyalty towards her Mum.

Pun intended. However, it\u2019s your gf\u2019s house and if she doesn\u2019t say anything to her parents, that\u2019s between her and them. Kudos for you getting her dad started on something. That\u2019s awesome for you two. Also, if you don\u2019t want to see all of you working hard to support her mother being a bum, then I would suggest moving back out or this is going to ruin what\u2019s left of your relationship.", "It was nice OP helped that dad and that it worked. It\u2019s like that tools colloquialism I can\u2019t quite remember. Don\u2019t be a tool but teach people tools? Idk", "YTA - here\u2019s the deal, you can\u2019t say anything bad about someone\u2019s family. Even if they do, you can\u2019t.

If you need emotional release, vent to a friend.", "It was actually a funny comment", "I see people saying ESH except dad, but how is the gf the AH?? I\u2019m confused.", "I'm not a good judge because I'm an AH, but I say NTA.  It was a private joke between him and his wife about something they're both frustrated about.

It's a really difficult situation with no obvious good solution (trust me, I've tried), and the joke was my way of coping\n\nI take issue with telling a renter that the place they rent isn't their home. It's not my house, but it's very much my home. It's the place I go back to every day to spend time with my GF. If I have a bad day, it's the only place I have to go to try to forget about things and wind down.

If you split the difference in that way, both partners benefit equally.  The owner makes a profit over what their additional expenses are and the renter saves an equal amount compared to what they would be spending on rent.\n\nThat may not work out or be perfect for everyone, but I think it\u2019s a good place to start.", "why would you heat a house with nobody in it?", "Ding ding, I think he purposely left off the actual amount he contributes and the cost of the mortgage", "bit harsh you're getting downvoted for this comment IMO.
