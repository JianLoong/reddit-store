My youngest sister has several mental disabilities including autism and intellectual disabilities. She is fully capable of doing household cleaning, cooking, hygiene, communicating and can read and write at a primary school level. Currently she lives alone in a government support house and has 24 hr carers who prompt her to do her chores and take her out on outings. My sister has extreme behaviours and during meltdowns and tantrums she will threaten people, kick and hit carers and refuses to do anything cause she wants her carers to do them for her. She has a care plan in place which enforces her to do her own cleaning and help curve her bad behaviour. \r\n\r\nAs bad as it sounds, me and my older sister do not like our younger sister or our father (65M). Our childhood was hell growing up with her. Our mother would try her best to teach her good behaviour and independence and I would see some progress. However, our father would coodle her because he didn't want to deal with her meltdowns and would brow beat our mother when she would try and get her to do chores or correct her behaviour. When our sister hit 18, our mother packed up and left the day after her birthday without telling us or our father. \r\n\r\nOur father tried to rope us in helping with our sister when this happened but we refused and he was left to take care of her. It took years for him to get enough assistance from the government so that she can get proper care. Whenever our sister doesn't like a carer asking her to do chores or something else she will call our father who will yell and brow beat the carer. Because of this and her meltdowns she runs through a lot of carers. This happened  a couple of weeks ago when my sister exploded and had another meltdown because she was in a bad mood and a carer asked her to do some cleaning. Our father was out of town for work and yelled at the carer over the phone. The carer called the police and an ambulance and walked out. Our father was calling me and my sister up trying to get us to help but we refused so she was held for three days in the hospital. When our father came back he had to take care of her for a week while the company organised more carers. \r\n\r\nOur father called us up a couple of days ago telling us how traumatised our sister is from the hospital and how exhausted he is. He said it was wrong for us to hate our sister so much and not step up in a time of crisis. I told him that he brought this on himself and it was his fault she was like this . Our extended family has been texting us saying how we are failures as family and we need to put the past behind us. I replied that they are welcome to step up and help as well. I am second guessing on whether I should have at least helped while my father was out of town because she had made a lot of progress lately but I still heavily resent her.

You are not your sister's keeper.   It's okay to dislike your sister.   I don't like my sister either.  She's just a pompous ass though.  \n\nDid your Mom ever tell you and your sister where she was living?", "Gotta love how uninvolved family members are the first to tell OP that SHE should step up and leave the past behind. Easy to browbeat people from a safe distance.", "> I told him that he brought this on himself and it was his fault she was like this . \n\nExactly. This is mostly a consequence of his bad parenting over the years, so the resulting problems are properly his to deal with. He is just trying to use his usual intimidation and guilt tactics to partially divert his responsibilities to you. He shouldn't get to do that. \n\n>Our extended family has been texting us saying how we are failures as family and we need to put the past behind us. I replied that they are welcome to step up and help as well.\n\nThey don't get to decide how much you are willing to forgive your father and how much of his responsibilities (if any) you are willing to take on. They only have the right to offer their own direct help. Of course it's easier for them to try to pressure you to do it in their stead.\n\nBottom line is the piper is asking to be paid and your father is wanting to you to help pay him. Sorry, he's the one who owes the piper. He should pay.", "**NTA**   Your father was directly responsible for the carer walking out, it's all on him to deal with.", "You obviously have a lot of trauma associated with your sister, your father and your mother leaving ostensibly because of your younger sister. This is not your responsibility anymore. Your dad is still around and if he can afford care for her it should be his responsibility.", "This sounds exhausting and I am sorry about the bad experiences you have had and continue having. Yes, we should help out family members, but we should also take care of ourselves.\n\nAnd my verdict is absolutely NTA. You have not abandoned your sister on the street. She was in a hospital = she was safe, surrounded by the people most capable of taking care of her. Which is (no offence to you) better for her than it would have been to stay with you/your sister. She needs professional care, not \u201cfamily help\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad's approach to your sister's care has created ongoing issues. As unpleasant as this was for all of you, perhaps it will make him think twice about screaming abuse at the carers, and enabling your sister's behaviour.\n\nAlso, super important - you did not leave your sister in an unsafe environment. She was in a *hospital*. She may have hated being there, but they were at least in a position to take proper care of her, which I doubt you would have been.\n\n>Our extended family has been texting us saying how we are failures as family and we need to put the past behind us\n\nIt's not in the past though, it's still happening. Her behaviour is a huge problem which you are not equipped to deal with. And your family with all their criticism, I'm guessing they are not offering any support or assistance, so they should keep their opinions to themselves.", "The father is TA.\n\nFirstly, for not parenting properly and undermining his wife, who WAS trying.\n\nSecondly, the carers walking out are a direct result of HIM yelling and browbeating them, NOT the behaviour of his daughter. No wonder the daughter keeps complaining to him, it gets her exactly what she wants in the moment. Unfortunately this will continue to happen until your father backs off and permits the carers to do their jobs.", "NTA. \n\nMy dad is on the spectrum and I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about. Family will try to guilt you sometimes, but at the end of the day your sister is not your responsibility. If you feel like it would be enabling her bad behavior, then you need to hold onto that. You do not always need to rescue someone. There were resources available and the carer did what they felt was right. Maybe this will push your father to hold your sister to be a bit of a higher standard because he was inconvenienced. I know that it\u2019s hard OP, but it\u2019s not on you. Don\u2019t let it get to you.", "NTA - as much as it sucks for your father, and your autistic sister, neither you nor your other sister have any true obligation to make your lives revolve around anyone other than yourselves. A lot of people with situations and conditions like your sister's manage with their support services to live full and amazing lives, and they are often super great worthwhile people who enrich the world around them *but* that still doesn't have to mean you. You have every right to dip and step out of a family situation that isn't your creation or responsibility.", "NTA. if your father wants your sisters caregivers to do everything for her and he needs to hire them with the agreement that they will do everything. I assume that will probably cost more but that\u2019s the price he will need to pay if he doesn\u2019t want to deal with her meltdowns. You are under no obligation to care for your sister, or even like her for that matter. For all of your family members who disagree with your position, tell them they are more than welcome to step up, after all, they are part of the family too. Make sure your father is aware that he will need to provide for her long-term care once he passes on because you don\u2019t intend to do it.", "INFO: What would have happened if you went to the hospital? Would you have to take her home with you? Would the visit have helped her mood? Are you NC with sister?", "NTA. People need to face the truth of their choices and your dad keeps pushing his consequences back on others. Maybe find a healthy way to process your anger for your own sake, but as for your dad/sister - no one rational will blame you for removing yourself from the situation.", "NTA. I understand what you have gone through and I can assure you that going no contact is an amazing relief.", "NTA by any means.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Your father created this situation, and it's his responsibility both as a parent and as an enabler to take care of it.\n\nAs for family members saying you and your sister are \" failing\" as a family for not allowing yourself to be roped in. Thank them and let them know how happy your father will be to add them to the list of those willing to step up. Dollars to donuts they will \"fail\" as family too.", "NTA\nYour sister has some serious problems. She needs professional carers for a number of reasons. 1. People are often less cooperative with family than with others. 2. Professional carers are there for their scheduled hours and then get a break or can quit while family gets stuck and burnt out. 3. Professional carers can more easily identify when people need additional care or treatment where family often misses (overlooks) the warning signs.\n\nIt would be nice if you and your sister could be involved as occasional visitors (not carers), especially when she is hospitalized with dad out of town. But you are the only one who can decide if that's possible.", "NAH.\n\nIt's clearly a terrible situation and I'm sorry to hear it's been that way your entire life. The stress of her constant care will likely always cause rifts among the immediate and extended family.\n\nYour sister's care is not on you. Give what you can to the extent that you can and be content with that.", "Idk man it sounds like you need a therapist or a family councillor, not Reddit. I\u2019m sure you think you\u2019re right but frankly it doesn\u2019t seem like you get that your sister is disabled, not just spoiled. Im not saying she can\u2019t be both, but if my siblings murdered someone I wouldn\u2019t let them sit in jail for 3 days. Idk why you think it\u2019s appropriate to let your sister rot scared and confused. Even if she\u2019s spoiled, it\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s your fathers. Don\u2019t let her suffer for it.", "NTA. You are not your sister's keeper, and it sounds like she was better off in the hospital. That being said...  \n\n\n\"My youngest sister has several mental disabilities including autism\"  \n\n\nAutism is not a mental disability. It's not a mental health issue at all. It would be best not to refer to it that way.", "NAH. Way above reddit's pay grade. This one needs specialized medical care for your sister and a family therapist for the rest of you.\n\nHowever, soft yta for not more learning about your sister's condition. There are support groups for children and family members of people with autism. I think meeting other people with similar family stories might help you find more peace and less resentment.\n\nSaying your dad enabled your sister by avoiding triggering her meltdowns... is probably complicated. Autistic meltdowns are not \"voluntary\" like normal emotions, they're more like a symptom that the person has gone beyond their (unfortunately low) mental limits. Further pushing just makes it worse. Most autistic people are much more functional if they are \\*not\\* pushed to meltdown.\n\nSome people just can't grow by being pushed. And if the limit of that growth is \"she can do the cleaning, sometimes\", then, well, that's just really fucking unfortunate but might not be anybody's fault.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its your father's job to get her the care she needs, not upset the carers until they quit. This is on him!", "NTA\nYour father created this situation so it's up to him to deal with it.  It's also worth noting your sisters behavior isn't  a classic \"meltdown\", she's just violent because your father has encouraged this. Any family who don't like it can step up. You should also come up with a care plan for when your father passes, it's likely your sister will end up medicated in a care home because he keeps encouraging her behavior.", "NTA You are not her parent, it isn't your job to care for her or even like her. Her disability does not give her a free pass to hurt you physically or mentally! You are not hurting her, abusing, or neglecting her by letting her remain in the hospital. It is safe there, clean and she has a ton of help. She just doesn't like it.\n\nI have autism and I have a kind of carer.
