My youngest sister has several mental disabilities including autism and intellectual disabilities. She is fully capable of doing household cleaning, cooking, hygiene, communicating and can read and write at a primary school level. Currently she lives alone in a government support house and has 24 hr carers who prompt her to do her chores and take her out on outings. My sister has extreme behaviours and during meltdowns and tantrums she will threaten people, kick and hit carers and refuses to do anything cause she wants her carers to do them for her. She has a care plan in place which enforces her to do her own cleaning and help curve her bad behaviour. \r\n\r\nAs bad as it sounds, me and my older sister do not like our younger sister or our father (65M). Our childhood was hell growing up with her. Our mother would try her best to teach her good behaviour and independence and I would see some progress. However, our father would coodle her because he didn't want to deal with her meltdowns and would brow beat our mother when she would try and get her to do chores or correct her behaviour. When our sister hit 18, our mother packed up and left the day after her birthday without telling us or our father. \r\n\r\nOur father tried to rope us in helping with our sister when this happened but we refused and he was left to take care of her. It took years for him to get enough assistance from the government so that she can get proper care. Whenever our sister doesn't like a carer asking her to do chores or something else she will call our father who will yell and brow beat the carer. Because of this and her meltdowns she runs through a lot of carers. This happened  a couple of weeks ago when my sister exploded and had another meltdown because she was in a bad mood and a carer asked her to do some cleaning. Our father was out of town for work and yelled at the carer over the phone. The carer called the police and an ambulance and walked out. Our father was calling me and my sister up trying to get us to help but we refused so she was held for three days in the hospital. When our father came back he had to take care of her for a week while the company organised more carers. \r\n\r\nOur father called us up a couple of days ago telling us how traumatised our sister is from the hospital and how exhausted he is. He said it was wrong for us to hate our sister so much and not step up in a time of crisis. I told him that he brought this on himself and it was his fault she was like this . Our extended family has been texting us saying how we are failures as family and we need to put the past behind us. I replied that they are welcome to step up and help as well. I am second guessing on whether I should have at least helped while my father was out of town because she had made a lot of progress lately but I still heavily resent her.

You are not your sister's keeper.   It's okay to dislike your sister.   I don't like my sister either.  She's just a pompous ass though.  \n\nDid your Mom ever tell you and your sister where she was living?", "Gotta love how uninvolved family members are the first to tell OP that SHE should step up and leave the past behind. Easy to browbeat people from a safe distance.", "> I told him that he brought this on himself and it was his fault she was like this . \n\nExactly. This is mostly a consequence of his bad parenting over the years, so the resulting problems are properly his to deal with. He is just trying to use his usual intimidation and guilt tactics to partially divert his responsibilities to you. He shouldn't get to do that. \n\n>Our extended family has been texting us saying how we are failures as family and we need to put the past behind us. I replied that they are welcome to step up and help as well.\n\nThey don't get to decide how much you are willing to forgive your father and how much of his responsibilities (if any) you are willing to take on. They only have the right to offer their own direct help. Of course it's easier for them to try to pressure you to do it in their stead.\n\nBottom line is the piper is asking to be paid and your father is wanting to you to help pay him. Sorry, he's the one who owes the piper. He should pay.", "**NTA**   Your father was directly responsible for the carer walking out, it's all on him to deal with.", "You obviously have a lot of trauma associated with your sister, your father and your mother leaving ostensibly because of your younger sister. This is not your responsibility anymore. Your dad is still around and if he can afford care for her it should be his responsibility.", "This sounds exhausting and I am sorry about the bad experiences you have had and continue having. Yes, we should help out family members, but we should also take care of ourselves.\n\nAnd my verdict is absolutely NTA. You have not abandoned your sister on the street. She was in a hospital = she was safe, surrounded by the people most capable of taking care of her. Which is (no offence to you) better for her than it would have been to stay with you/your sister. She needs professional care, not \u201cfamily help\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad's approach to your sister's care has created ongoing issues. As unpleasant as this was for all of you, perhaps it will make him think twice about screaming abuse at the carers, and enabling your sister's behaviour.\n\nAlso, super important - you did not leave your sister in an unsafe environment. She was in a *hospital*. She may have hated being there, but they were at least in a position to take proper care of her, which I doubt you would have been.\n\n>Our extended family has been texting us saying how we are failures as family and we need to put the past behind us\n\nIt's not in the past though, it's still happening. Her behaviour is a huge problem which you are not equipped to deal with. And your family with all their criticism, I'm guessing they are not offering any support or assistance, so they should keep their opinions to themselves.", "The father is TA.\n\nFirstly, for not parenting properly and undermining his wife, who WAS trying.\n\nSecondly, the carers walking out are a direct result of HIM yelling and browbeating them, NOT the behaviour of his daughter. No wonder the daughter keeps complaining to him, it gets her exactly what she wants in the moment. Unfortunately this will continue to happen until your father backs off and permits the carers to do their jobs.", "NTA. \n\nMy dad is on the spectrum and I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about. Family will try to guilt you sometimes, but at the end of the day your sister is not your responsibility. If you feel like it would be enabling her bad behavior, then you need to hold onto that. You do not always need to rescue someone. There were resources available and the carer did what they felt was right. Maybe this will push your father to hold your sister to be a bit of a higher standard because he was inconvenienced. I know that it\u2019s hard OP, but it\u2019s not on you. Don\u2019t let it get to you.", "NTA - as much as it sucks for your father, and your autistic sister, neither you nor your other sister have any true obligation to make your lives revolve around anyone other than yourselves. A lot of people with situations and conditions like your sister's manage with their support services to live full and amazing lives, and they are often super great worthwhile people who enrich the world around them *but* that still doesn't have to mean you. You have every right to dip and step out of a family situation that isn't your creation or responsibility.", "NTA. if your father wants your sisters caregivers to do everything for her and he needs to hire them with the agreement that they will do everything. I assume that will probably cost more but that\u2019s the price he will need to pay if he doesn\u2019t want to deal with her meltdowns. You are under no obligation to care for your sister, or even like her for that matter. For all of your family members who disagree with your position, tell them they are more than welcome to step up, after all, they are part of the family too. Make sure your father is aware that he will need to provide for her long-term care once he passes on because you don\u2019t intend to do it.", "INFO: What would have happened if you went to the hospital? Would you have to take her home with you? Would the visit have helped her mood? Are you NC with sister?", "NTA. People need to face the truth of their choices and your dad keeps pushing his consequences back on others. Maybe find a healthy way to process your anger for your own sake, but as for your dad/sister - no one rational will blame you for removing yourself from the situation.", "NTA. I understand what you have gone through and I can assure you that going no contact is an amazing relief.", "NTA by any means.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Your father created this situation, and it's his responsibility both as a parent and as an enabler to take care of it.\n\nAs for family members saying you and your sister are \" failing\" as a family for not allowing yourself to be roped in. Thank them and let them know how happy your father will be to add them to the list of those willing to step up. Dollars to donuts they will \"fail\" as family too.", "NTA\nYour sister has some serious problems. She needs professional carers for a number of reasons. 1. People are often less cooperative with family than with others. 2. Professional carers are there for their scheduled hours and then get a break or can quit while family gets stuck and burnt out. 3. Professional carers can more easily identify when people need additional care or treatment where family often misses (overlooks) the warning signs.\n\nIt would be nice if you and your sister could be involved as occasional visitors (not carers), especially when she is hospitalized with dad out of town. But you are the only one who can decide if that's possible.", "NAH.\n\nIt's clearly a terrible situation and I'm sorry to hear it's been that way your entire life. The stress of her constant care will likely always cause rifts among the immediate and extended family.\n\nYour sister's care is not on you. Give what you can to the extent that you can and be content with that.", "Idk man it sounds like you need a therapist or a family councillor, not Reddit. I\u2019m sure you think you\u2019re right but frankly it doesn\u2019t seem like you get that your sister is disabled, not just spoiled. Im not saying she can\u2019t be both, but if my siblings murdered someone I wouldn\u2019t let them sit in jail for 3 days. Idk why you think it\u2019s appropriate to let your sister rot scared and confused. Even if she\u2019s spoiled, it\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s your fathers. Don\u2019t let her suffer for it.", "NTA. You are not your sister's keeper, and it sounds like she was better off in the hospital. That being said...  \n\n\n\"My youngest sister has several mental disabilities including autism\"  \n\n\nAutism is not a mental disability. It's not a mental health issue at all. It would be best not to refer to it that way.", "NAH. Way above reddit's pay grade. This one needs specialized medical care for your sister and a family therapist for the rest of you.\n\nHowever, soft yta for not more learning about your sister's condition. There are support groups for children and family members of people with autism. I think meeting other people with similar family stories might help you find more peace and less resentment.\n\nSaying your dad enabled your sister by avoiding triggering her meltdowns... is probably complicated. Autistic meltdowns are not \"voluntary\" like normal emotions, they're more like a symptom that the person has gone beyond their (unfortunately low) mental limits. Further pushing just makes it worse. Most autistic people are much more functional if they are \\*not\\* pushed to meltdown.\n\nSome people just can't grow by being pushed. And if the limit of that growth is \"she can do the cleaning, sometimes\", then, well, that's just really fucking unfortunate but might not be anybody's fault.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's also worth noting your sisters behavior isn't  a classic \"meltdown\", she's just violent because your father has encouraged this. Any family who don't like it can step up.

While she is disabled she is far from being incapable. \nYour father made this monster and how he has to accept the consequences. You chose to cut ties and that is because of him. \nYou put yourself first OP and don\u2019t feel bad for that.", "NTA Your father is reaping what he sowed. I only feel sorry for the poor carers asigned to your sister. Remind any family who get on your back about this that your fathers past actions are what have caused this situation. With his coddling and enabling of your sister and his bullying and abuse of her carers. After all it was his bullying who caused yet another carer to leave. If they dont like it. THEY can help", "NTA. \n\nit\u2019s absolutely normal to resent your sister in this situation. \n\nmy brother is severely autistic and my entire childhood was centered around his needs. police were often called, violence was common from him towards us, and our needs were often  last resort. my mom is just now starting to hold boundaries that he cannot emotionally or physically abuse her or us. but for 30 years- he has. \n\nto be clear this isn\u2019t about shaming autism, it\u2019s just a reality of a lot of family\u2019s who have people with high needs and different brains, and their behaviors. My brother is now living on his own (we never thought that was possible), but not without immense medication, therapy and sacrifice from the entire family. \n\nyour dad is trying to parentify you and your other sibling. your not responsible for parenting or caring for your sister. and he actually stunted her growth by rolling over and coddling her. and worse than that- he\u2019s so mean and cruel multiple caretakers have quit. tbh caretakers have pretty strong backbones. to have multiple walk outs is pretty telling. \n\nas a former care worker- your dad sounds insufferable. and like he\u2019s actively holding back your sister and actively abusive to any caretaker she has. if her needs are so high she cannot do chores without a breakdown, she may need a higher level of care- and your dad isn\u2019t helping with that. on that same note- if every time your sister has a breakdown over discomfort your dad *has his own breakdown* that results in angry outbursts- none of this is viable. this whole situation is messy af. it would take SO much for me to leave a disabled client at the hospital. \n\n\n\nhe should\u2019ve figured out a whole plan for when he was gone- and asked consent for every person involved before hand. and been kind to the professional helping her.\n\n\ni\u2019d absolutely encourage you to start making some clear boundaries with your dad- he does not sound like he is sane. he\u2019s driving away caretakers constantly, that aggression isn\u2019t normal. your sister probably knows that if she throws a fit- the caretaker will leave and dad will come. idk, it just gives me anxiety thinking about everyone involved. your dad needs anger management and therapy- and you should absolutely write down exactly what your willing to do in terms of care. sounds like dad is wanting the \u201cfamily\u201d back together and mom is gone so he\u2019s pushing that onto you which isn\u2019t fair. his outbursts at caretakers also read as trauma based projection.", "NTA. If your extended family wants get involved in her care, they are welcome to. And your father needs to learn to curb his behavior towards the people trained to actually help your sister - the professional carers. If he can't support them, why should he get any support?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour dad is the AH here. This is HIS fault, let HIM handle the fallout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\". Our extended family has been texting us saying how we are failures as family \"c .. Tell them how great it is that they are offering to help, and to coordinate directly with your dad.", "NTA \n\nYour father though? Total AH. You were right on the money, calling him out. He wants to enable her shitty attitude? He gets to deal with the outcome of that personally, he doesn\u2019t get to delegate that to anyone else.  I also seriously doubt this really has anything to do with forgiveness. This has everything to do with your father not wanting to be a full time caregiver anymore. Your mother rightfully called it quits and now he\u2019s trying to intimidate, guilt, and manipulate you and your sister into taking her place so he happily can sit on ass and not deal with the fallout of the bs his decisions caused. As far as your \u201cfamily\u201d they don\u2019t get to decide what is and isn\u2019t forgivable. They didn\u2019t live your life, it\u2019s not their childhood that was stolen. if they care so much, they should put their money where their mouth is. In fact I\u2019m pretty sure your dads been badgering THEM for help, and that\u2019s the only reason they\u2019re trying to browbeat you into doing it so they don\u2019t have to. If I were you I\u2019d just block their numbers. Them and your dad really, I mean truly what are you gaining by staying in contact?  I can\u2019t imagine that a \u201cdad\u201d demanding you stop your life to take care of your abusive sister because he\u2019s tired of dealing with her shit himself; is a dad that calls just to check in on you, takes you on daddy daughter dates, or helps you with the bills. If you can\u2019t seem to shut him out and you\u2019ve been holding out hope that he\u2019ll change, the only thing you can do is set strict boundaries and stick with them. \n\nTell him in short that she is the way she is because of him, and that your mom left because she couldn\u2019t handle dealing with the mess his enablement created. That it\u2019s fucked up he would demand you stop your life as an adult to protect him from his life choices, when he refused to protect you his child at all. That moving forward the topic of your sister is off limits, if he wants any kind of relationship with you. That if he refuses to stop or continues to guilt or intimidate you into helping that he\u2019ll be blocked until he can learn to respect your decision moving forward. I also just want to say that if you had \u201chelped\u201d until your dad got back, there\u2019s no way in hell he was going to step up until he was able to \u201cfind\u201d a caregiver. He fully would have intended for you to watch her 24/7 and delayed finding a caregiver at all. Since it seems he assumes it\u2019s your responsibility to do so in the first place. Actually I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he extended his trip to get out of having to reclaim responsibility once he was back. Best case he wouldve left the responsibility on you even after he got home until he did happen to find someone; that said I really am I\u2019m nearly sure he would\u2019ve attempted to force it into a a permanent situation. You were smart not to help for even a day, it\u2019s a slippery slope. You have to stand firm or he\u2019ll pounce and take advantage the second you slip. \n\nNot to mention if your dad believes he can convince or guilt you to help in an emergency, there\u2019s conveniently going to be A LOT of \u201cemergencies\u201d to get out of having to do things himself. Faked work trips, faking being called into work, or \u201cextended work hours\u201d etc. There would always be something. Protect your peace OP. You are not your fathers keeper, and you are not your sisters keeper. Even if you did love your sister beyond words, liked spending time with her, and didn\u2019t happen to resent her. it\u2019s still would not be your responsibility to stop your life to care of her. Your dad and your dad alone is responsible for her long term and short term care. Your mothers technically included in that as well however; considering all the years of abuse she endured.. I don\u2019t blame her in the slightest, I blame him. He ran off the help he had and costed you a mom in the process because he refused to be a responsible fucking parent. So it\u2019s on him to deal with fallout his decisions caused, without trying to delegate it to anyone and everyone else that\u2019ll let him because he\u2019s tired of the monster he created. He never intended to have to deal with her long term, he just enabled her and expected it to be your mothers problem. Now that she\u2019s gone he\u2019s fully resentful he has to deal with what he himself created. He\u2019s trying to runaway from his responsibilities yet again by trying to convince you, his daughter that\u2019s it\u2019s your responsibility to do so. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s not. \n\nAlso I  want to say that it\u2019s okay for you to resent your sister, and it\u2019s okay to resent your father too. They stole your entire childhood, and in the end stole they your mother from you too. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s in your life now, but you should have never had to go a day without your mom; and that\u2019s not a bash at your mom, it\u2019s a bash on him. He made her leave, they both made her leave. They stole your mother from your entirely. Now he wants to steal your adulthood, your time, your peace and your sanity? It\u2019s nearly down right comical of him to ask. Look don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn\u2019t feel, or that \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d to forgive him. That\u2019s your decision abe only your decision. For the record forgiveness doesn\u2019t mean stopping your life, helping him out. Forgiveness is for the victim, not the perpetrator. It\u2019s essentially accepting what happened to you and not hating them for it. That however does not include helping your dad or being in her life. Those are two completely separate things, that you don\u2019t EVER have to do nor should you. You can accept the cards you were dealt, accept that it wasn\u2019t easy for either of them, and also accept that it\u2019s wrong for him to try to delegate responsibility to you when it\u2019s soley his responsibility to deal with her. Actually while we\u2019re on the subject it would also be smart of you to make it well known now rather than later, that you are in no way shape or form taking responsibility for her in the event of his death. I\u2019d tell him I\u2019d be wise for him to create a living trust for her to make sure her needs are met after he\u2019s gone, because you and your sister won\u2019t have anything to do with it. So unless he wants her to become a ward of the state without any specifications to her care, he needs to get on that ASAP.", "> I replied that they are welcome to step up and help as well.\n\nYou.

She might even end up in jail if she lashes out and causes harm to someone, so he really needs to fix his mess soon.", "NTA but if in America your diet should be in a CILA or DD home where your father would have to deal with a administrator and not the direct care professional and not be allowed to yell and get his way like he does and neither would she!!", "NTA, your dad is enabling her behavior and thinks that you and your sister should have to clean up his mess. You did the right thing by putting her in the hospital because now she knows there is some serious consequences to her behavior. \n\nAs for your relatives, don't worry about them. Unless their willing to step up and take care of her their opinion is meaningless.", "NTA Your sister was traumatised from hospital? She was likely on prescription drugs to dull the trauma. I can\u2019t say the same for those poor carers who deserve to work in a safe environment.", "The care home should be supplying the health aides, correct? So she would remain at the care home. This set up is unusual.", "NTA. You are probably not even fully equipped to take care of her, and such a situation could easily slide into something more permanent when you are not looking. If your father does not want to run out of caregivers, he will have to learn how to deal with them in a professional manner.", "NTA. It's a real pity that your father didn't have more insight into your sister's needs. He could have been working, with your mother, through her adolescence on setting up proper support for her so that she could move into assisted living when she became an adult.\n\nI don't know whether wiser parenting might also have helped to mitigate some of these behaviours. I don't know whether therapy for your father might help to improve his ability to cope now. I can only imagine how stressful things are for him, and it's a pity that he doesn't seem to be seeking support from appropriate channels (here in the UK he would be eligible for a carer's assessment to see if social services could support him to care for her).\n\nBut either way, it's not on you or your other sister to compensate for your father's shortcomings.
