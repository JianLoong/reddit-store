I'm engaged, getting married next month, living in an apartment currently, my fiancee's parents are kindly building a house for us, will be ready this year for us to move in and the house will be under our names and with no mortgage to pay. \n\nHe has a friend that would like to move out of his dad's house and get his own place, my fiancee offered for him to move in the new house later on and he said it'd be easy income and we could have more savings with it -since we will have no mortgage to pay-. He's a pothead though and nothing wrong with that, I don't care what he does but when it comes to my space I have a problem, but my fiancee gets defensive every time I try to talk to him about it because he says we could work around it and set some rules -like no smoking in the house, etc- but I told him I still see some problems surfacing, with also the fact that his gf does cocaine and that's another issue, they spend their nights and weekends together and I do not want his gf there either.\n\nMy fiancee says he already told the guy he's welcome and that it'd be rude to just tell him the offer is off the table, I told him I could have that conversation with him if he does not want to but he's fixated on the money, mind you I told him I could get a better job or something for us to have more savings.\n\nI also told him I don't want people -roommates- in our house when we start having kids and he's also hesitant about that, he says it could be fine with people in the house and that he'd like the extra income, ugh.\n\nI am not sure if I'm missing something or what but AITA here?", "created_utc": 1676750414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115oh30/aita_for_not_wanting_a_pothead_as_a_roommate_with/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To be honest, doesn't really matter whether the guy smokes pot or not, your fiancee just made a decision to get a lodger (or at least, who it would be) without consulting you.  All of that should be a joint decision (can't work out if I intended that pun or not.)", "NTA. Y'all are about to get married. Honestly super sketchy he wants to have any roommate, let alone this guy.", "NTA. Let's see, \n\n1) He invited someone to live with you without discussing. \n\n2) You are uncomfortable with this, and he is putting his friend's feelings before yours already, by not wanting to rescind the offer (that you never agreed to in the 1st place)\n\n3) He is planning this to be long term, seeing as he deflected when you said you didn't want roommates when you had kids in the next few years (OP states later in a comment that he is actually getting ANGRY at them about this now)\n\n4) Now there is a GF in the mix, who is probably going to be there most weekends it sounds like (hopefully she has her own place and he can just go there, but IDK)\n\n5) GF uses cocaine. Weed is one thing, even in legalized states, but coke is another animal entirely\n\n6) He hasn't listened to a single issue you brought up, how your feelings towards this are, and refuses to rectify the situation he is trying to put you in, this is really really important. Does he usually do this? \n\n7) Who is going to handle any conflicts that come up? Basic roommate disagreements? Obviously not him, so are you really willing to have to deal with all this crap, be the bad guy, for something you never wanted in the 1st place? \n\n8) You're going to be newlyweds, in your 1st house, and he is already just giving away your time to enjoy it together, by yourselves. \n\nGeez. This makes me uncomfortable, I can only imagine how you must be feeling.", "NTA but you need to stop planning this wedding and go to couples counseling. Your fianc\u00e9 already feels entitled to make life changing decisions *behind your back.*", "NTA\n\nThere won't be any extra money coming in because that friend won't pay rent. Why would he? I bet there won't be any kind of written contract. He'll just keep promising to pay the next month...\n\nWhat about your future inlaws? Are they aware they are building a drug den for their son's friend's cokehead gf? Maybe talk to them?", "NTA- I wouldn't want a roommate as a newlywed. \nAlso, you're getting a house for free- the new income thing sounds a little greedy. \n\nIt feels like your fianc\u00e9 is a little immature to get married if he'd rather move in his draggy friends.", "NTA. Your partner can't make decisions like that unilaterally. You need to both be on board.", "It sounds like he feels that because his parents are building the house, he is the only one to make decisions regarding who lives there. Is this how you want to live your life? Are you sure your name will be on the deed? There are liability factors if law enforcement ever finds illegal substances in your home. Are his parents aware this is his plan?\n\nIt sounds like there are many more things to be discussed before you marry him. NTA", "NTA Not sure how your bf thought inviting a roommate without asking you first would be ok. It\u2019s not. I\u2019m also not sure why he thinks having a roommate as you\u2019re getting used to being married is ok. It\u2019s not.\n\nIf this house had a garage apartment something similar, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. That\u2019s not the case, though. He\u2019s willing to trade all privacy for a check from someone you already know is going to be a problem. That\u2019s beyond foolish.\n\nAs for a roommate when you have kids? Tell him you\u2019ll revisit the issue when your oldest is one. Your bf has no clue. He can weigh in when he\u2019s actually charged with keeping a child safe & when he sees how much a child changes your life.\n\nTell him absolutely not on the pothead roommate with the cokehead gf. He can tell his friend the truth: he didn\u2019t ask you about it, and you do t want a roommate right now.", "NTA. That is a major decision to make without you as you start your married lives together. It doesn't even matter if he WASN'T a pothead with a girlfriend who does coke. Asking anyone to live with you without your consent is not a good choice. The drugs just make it worse. Successful marriages require constant communication, and he needs to work on his.", "NTA. And your fiance is wrong that it's \"rude\" to tell the other man he can't come. People are allowed to change their minds.\n\nYou can set rules about smoking, but that doesn't mean they'll be followed; might get lax over time. Plus, that stench will leach in everywhere, even if they smoke outside.\n\nYou don't say if pot is legal where you are. But cocaine definitely is. Who knows what else they'll bring into this relationship? As the home owners, you can get in trouble for harboring drug users.\n\nAnd the fact he's so set in doing this and dismissing your concerns is troubling. I'd put this marriage on hold if I were you.", "NTA. This would be a deal breaker for me. The wedding would be on hold until it was fixed.", "Nta \n\nBypass him and tell the people who are paying for this house his stupid idea. I'm sure they'll have a major issue with this", "NTA,  don't know what a pothead is but girlfriend doing drugs?! Is your fiance completely out of his damn mind?!!!!!!!!! \nYou need to stay away as much as possible from those people,. If you bring them in your house. He will probably live off you, not pay rent and will refuse to leave! Your fiance is running after money in the wrong area and with wrong people...\nIt is normal that once you have your own house, you marry, you want to have your own household. Not shared with anyone, let alone a possible drug addict!!!\nOMG... I would call police on that girl.\nAlso questionable what kind of people your fiance has contact with", "NTA. \n\nThis has less to do with the money and more to do with your fiance making a huge decision without you.\n\nI would strongly recommend sitting down with your fiance before the wedding and have a talk about this. Even without the drug use, he needs to take into account that it's your home too and you should feel comfortable with it. Ask him how he would feel if you agreed to let someone move in without discussing it with him first. \n\nI would be more understanding if the friend was being kicked out, but this is just him wanting to leave his father's place. \n\nYour fiance is probably trying to be a good friend, but he's still an AH for not considering you in this equation.", "NTA. Regardless of this person's hobbies, y'all getting married and moving into a house that's both of yours. Roommates are a group decision where both need to agree to it.", "You are not the asshole for not wanting a pothead roommate, especially if you have concerns about drug use in your home and around your future children. It's understandable that you want to create a safe and comfortable living environment for yourself and your future family.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to have open and honest communication with your fianc\u00e9 about your concerns and priorities. It's okay to set boundaries and say no to something that makes you uncomfortable, even if it means potentially losing out on some extra income. It's not worth sacrificing your peace of mind and sense of security.\r  \n\r  \nYou may want to consider discussing alternative options with your fianc\u00e9, such as finding another roommate who is a better fit, or finding other ways to increase your income without compromising your values. Ultimately, it's important to make decisions that are in the best interest of you and your future family.", "NTA. So your soon to be idiot husband is ok with illegal drugs under his roof?", "NTA, but the fact he made a major decision without you is a huge red flag. First of all, who'd want a rommate in the house owned and while starting a family? Second, if he wants a rommate that badly, you can search for a person together, third, eviction is difficult so you may end up stuck with a pothead and a cocain sniffing gf for a long while.", "You\u2019re not able to veto something as huge and intrusive as having a roommate? That\u2019s a big red flag.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to reframe his thinking. \n\n1. His parents are building a home for BOTH of you. This is a joint asset. You BOTH have a say. \n\n2. He has a problem with saying no to everyone except you. When he should be putting you above everyone else, because, YOU\u2019RE THE ONE HE\u2019S MARRYING.\n\n3. Is your fianc\u00e9 willing to lose you over this? Because he\u2019s going to eventually. I don\u2019t believe in ultimatums or tattling to his parents but I do believe you that the inevitable problems and resentment will ruin this marriage before it\u2019s begun. \n\nI would suggest that you bring it up at the next family gathering with his parents. When they ask you a direct question about the future, be honest about the situation.", "NTA - this is such a dealbreaker. \n\nAlready showing a parade of red flags before your marriage has even started. Is he just thinking about the money to pocket for himself? Like what\u2019s with the focus on cash over your own newlywed experience? \n\nEveryone already mentioned some -\nDismissing your feelings\nDefensive when you try to discuss it\nDoesn\u2019t respect you or thinks you need to be consulted in these big decisions\n\nI would stop the wedding until there\u2019s a clear conversation around -\n-This roommate decision and understand where he made mistakes, rescind the offer to his friend \n- If your name is on the lease so there\u2019s equal ownership\n- How to work better as a couple when these kind of big decisions come up again. You need to be respected partners in these matters.\n\nHe can\u2019t just pull shit like this. Roommates require agreements, ground rules, cleaning schedules, visitors, common area rules etc. Did he even care to think about that or was the mental load going to be entirely on you?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but this is a huge red flag. You\u2019re a partnership, he shouldn\u2019t be forcing anything on you that makes you feel uncomfortable. Your home is your sanctuary. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard to hear this. But things might not work out with this man. He\u2019s placing his friends feelings over yours. You should be number one, not two.", "You are missing that your soon to be husband wants to be a pothead with his friend.", "NTA He shouldn't unilaterally make decisions. You guys are a team. Plus, I think it's normal to want to live with just your partner, not some random person...", "NTA and this is the same as him inviting someone to your honeymoon. You shouldn't be the only one excited to start off married life as a unit", ">I am not sure if I'm missing something or what but AITA here?\n\nNTA, but well, actually I do think you're missing something if you're renting out to anybody: a written contract.\n\nIf your fiance has agreed to enter a contract with his friend, I don't think you can get him to renege that. My vote reflects that I'm unconvinced he has actually committed to put no drugs rules down in writing, so there's still some work to be done.\n\nYour fiance's friend is perfectly free to bail once he sees the contract and you fail to come to an agreement on it.", "NTA.  Your fiance told this guy yes without asking.  He stomped on your boundaries knowing you don't want a pothead with a cocaine gf who more than likely will be coming over while you are working.  \n\nPostpone the wedding.  Talk to fiance.  Try to compromise.  Maybe a roommate without this guy's issues.  Make sure you get a legal lease signed by all parties with stipulations about eviction for certain issues.", "NTA. Having extra people in the house is a \"two yeses one no\" situation. Adding any living entity that takes up more energy than a medium effort plant requires the buy-in of all the adults responsible for the home.", "Hard NTA, your fiance is completely off his rocker. Why the hell would you want roommates and what is it that he needs to save so hard for? You will have a house, no mortgage and therefore well ahead in life from most ppl at that age. For me this would be the hill I would die on! No roommates or no wedding!", "First off, NTA.\n\nYour fiancee is currently making HUGE decisions that directly affect your life without having a discussion with you about it, and as soon as you voice concern about it, your views are outweighed by money and his friend's feelings. That's all there is to it, he's not willing to listen to you about this. \n\nSecond, using a term like \"pothead\" in your post title is not necessarily the best way to go about this. 99% of these comments are wayyyyyy too focused on the fact that the friend smokes weed and vilifying him solely for that, as well as your fiancee for even being associated with someone who indulges in the devil's lettuce.", "He's only \"hesitant\" about having people smoking weed and snorting cocaine when you have your future children around?? Hmm.. wonder if he would still be hesitant when child protective services turn up. \n\nMoney isn't everything, and tbh, I'd be reconsidering marrying him at this rate.", "NTA - I can see him moving in and then wasting all his rent money on pot and it be he can't pay rent and then it be a year.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Where do you see her making a decision WITHOUT him?\n\n>my fiancee gets defensive every time I try to talk to him about it \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I told him I still see some problems surfacing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I also told him I don't want people -roommates- in our house when we start having kids and he's also hesitant about that", "If you hate this sub, you can always leave bruv \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nHe already offered the place without telling her, if you can\u2019t read between the lines, that\u2019s on you", ">I also told him\n\nTHAT is making a demand, without talking and compromising.", "NTA and having myself been in a situation somewhat similar - your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to live in grown-up land away from his friends. I think you should brace yourself for a break up but start with laying down much firmer boundaries.", "NTA\n\nWhy did he offer this guy a place to stay without talking with you and getting an agreement? The last thing I would want to do is share my first home with my new spouse. It doesn't really sound like you need the money when there is no mortgage payment. Why is your husband so eager to share space as a newlywed?\n\nSounds like you'd be better off keeping your apartment. What you're describing isn't an ideal living situation long term.", "NTA-\n\nI wanted to comment because I feel For you and see a train wreck. A home with your fianc\u00e9 and 1+ will feel very small. You will not be comfortable in your own home, walking out in underwear to get a drink? Probably not, loud sex probably not, you will end up cleaning up after two men. Most spaces will be shared spaces. Conflicts will be you forcing your husband to take sides. That is just to top line stuff. Potentially having a drug user in the home (cocaine) sets up all sorts of challenges, legal, financial and more. Rules will be broken, hearts will be broken. This is absolutely a hill to die on. Do not compromise, no short term until he gets on his feet, no it\u2019s for the financial gain, no it\u2019s I feel bad no no no.", "If I were you I would put my foot down with this and make it a hill to die on. He needs to learn if he's going to have a successful marriage that decisions like this need to be discussed and agreed together beforehand", "NTA", "How much savings does he think he needs when he's already done away with a monthly mortgage payment? If things  don't work out,  he'll need savings for divorce costs.", "I bet the house will be only in his name. \n\n And don't put any more deposits down on venues caterers etc. \n\nOh maybe you might look to see about having more housemates. Your mother, sisters, a best friend? or even a kinda friend who has a chip on her shoulder for pot heads or men.  ~~Or maybe an EX of yours~~\n\nNTA", "Your fianc\u00e9 is (passive aggressively) showing you who the REAL owner of the house is by making this play to move a roommate in.  You keep mentioning how possessive he is of this house that his parents are gifting.  Moving the roommate in is like marking his territory, showing you who the boss of the house really is.  It won't stop with this roommate.", "You already aren\u2019t going to have a mortgage, which I can\u2019t even imagine, cause you seem young, but how much money do y\u2019all need?\nYour fianc\u00e9e should not have made that decision without you period.\nI\u2019d hold off on the wedding until you can establish ground rules.", "NTA and honestly if your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t having your back on this I would reconsider getting married. If he\u2019s scared to let someone else down instead of his future wife.", "Just ask him, does he want to Live with his wife or his stoner friend? Because if he doesn't talk with you and listen to you, he's going to be single living with him. NTA.\n\nAlso who wants to live with a newly married couple?", "NTA. There are times that it is so important to stand up for yourself. This is one of them, as it will set the tone to your home life. If he will not listen or retract the offer - you have your answer about your relationship.", "NTA. You have a right to decline even if the guy wasn't a pothead. if he's treating you like this right before you get married, I wonder what he'll be like after. Doesn't  bode well.", "And i found it so funny \"easy money\" \"just a room\". Soooo..... he won't use the kitchen and the bathroom, maybe even the living room? And of course using the laundry room. Oh no, OP can do his dirty laundry and cook for him. I mean he lived with mommy snd daddy, he doesn't know how to do shit! And of course he while munch all there food... But hey, easy money! \n\nNTA", "Yeah, these two seem incompatible. \n\nNTA, OP. Your fianc\u00e9 wants to force you to live with undesirable roommates against your will because:\n\n- \u201cit would be rude to take the offer off the table\u201d\n- he values additional income over your personal feelings of safety and comfort in your own home \n\nThis is not a man you want to tie yourself to and make babies with. The great news is that a breakup is a million times easier than a divorce.", "Lol Jesus this sub is so sheltered", "Her name would need to be on the deed, rather than lease, but everything else 100%.", "Missed a great opportunity to use \"hash\".", "I feel like the house build has already started, and this guy figures he'll get it whether he's married or not. This seems like a way to force her to be the one to call it off, thereby ensuring she doesn't get any claim on it in the divorce.", "Honestly, at this point I would refuse to move in and put the wedding on hold. He\u2019s dictating your living situation and has no regard for your feelings, and y\u2019all have a free house and jobs\u2026so what\u2019s the real reason he wants his friend living there and bringing over his cokehead girlfriend to boot?", "He\u2019s \u201cnot usually like this\u201d\u2026 but sweetie - he IS like this, and in regards to your personal feelings of safety and comfort in what is supposedly to be YOUR home.  Forget the house. This guy just gave away your home without even asking you how you felt. That says he doesn\u2019t care how it makes you feel.", "Girl there are much bigger issues than just a roommate at stake here (tho you're right about all that too). This man does not view this as your future home together, it's His House that he's letting you live in and that's why your opinion means zilch here \n\nWhat is going to happen when you guys hit a rough patch and he pulls the \"it's the house MY PARENTS built for ME!\" card? Like...there are serious safety concerns you might have to consider for future you.", "Are you really prepared to marry in a month when you can't have a reasonable discussion now about him moving in a friend right after you marry & not even knowing if you'll be on the deed to your home? Are y'all ready to be married?", "This is the proverbial hill to die on.", "Every single letter of all of this!! I would absolutely refuse to move forward with anydamnthing for the foreseeable future with this dude unless he tells his \"friend\" to kick rocks. F that noise."]}
