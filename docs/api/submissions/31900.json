You need to cough up the money to financially assist them or you need to mind your own business and realise not everything is about you. It is reasonable to say you do not want to have interaction of any kind with this woman. You will not come over if she is there at the same time. You don't want them trying to tell you how she is going or tell her about you. In all likelihood, she will burn them but they are adults and that is their risk to take. Wash your hands of the matter and tell them not to come crying to you when she turns on them.
