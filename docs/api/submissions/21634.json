I really love him and want to marry him, but am having issues with his friends (Priya, Chris, & Teddy.)\n\nI need to explain background first. After getting into Yale, his mom (who was a single mom) passed away from breast cancer. He said after making really high marks in school, working, and taking care of his mom, he was burnt out and seriously depressed.\n\nHe was living with his uncle and started abusing Xanax and other drugs. Covid happened, and all his classes were online. Because he was high/depressed, he stopped doing his class work. All he had to do was pass bc he already got in to Yale, but he couldn\u2019t muster up the effort to do that.\n\nHis friends really helped him during this time. They took schedules to make sure he wasn\u2019t alone. They (Chris, Priya, and Teddy) took turns doing his homework and turning it in. They had all his passwords for everything. He said the night his final was due, he slept through the deadline and cried, knowing he was ruining his life, to later find out his friends had done it & turned it in for him.\n\nHe said without his friends he would not have ended up at Yale, neither would he have gotten sober. I think this is a fabrication, if his teachers knew he was struggling after his mom passed away but was normally a good student, they wouldn\u2019t have failed him but whatever.\n\nI understand they are close and childhood friends and all that, but this all rubs me the wrong way. I know Chris is gay, Teddy is bi, and Priya is also into guys. It\u2019s hard for me to believe they don\u2019t like him.\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who would do all that for someone who was just a friend. I tell this to him repeatedly that I don\u2019t like how close they are, at first he reassured me he isn\u2019t interested in them but now he just gets annoyed when I bring it up. He says I need to stop sexualizing his relationships with his childhood best friends. I said I wouldn\u2019t do all that for my friends, and he said well, it sounds like I haven\u2019t had friends that were that close to me.\n\nThat really hurt my feelings, and he apologized, but said I really needed to stop. He\u2019s not going to date his best friends. He said unlike me he doesn\u2019t have a family to go home to, he just has his friends, so they are extra important. They are like his brothers/sisters. He doesn\u2019t like to be told over and over again that his family secretly just wants to bone him.\n\nBut I can\u2019t get over it. He does a lot for them. When Priya\u2019s service dog went missing he came home and took off from school for a week to help her look for him. When Chris\u2019s car broke down, he helped him with a down payment on a new car. When Teddy couldn\u2019t clean his apartment, he went over and cleaned it for him.\n\nI feel bad when compared to his friends. They went through such a hard time when he was 17 and I wasn\u2019t there for any of it, but they were. Why would he pick me over them?

You ended your post with the question literally everyone reading this post probably was asking.  You don't deserve this dude and he certainly doesn't deserve to be with someone like you.  Want reasons?  **1)**  He went through the roughest of times in his life and was failing himself.  Who was there to lift him up?  They were.  They carried him across the finish line when he didn't have the energy to stand.  They ARE his family.  They care about him.  They sacrificed for him.  They loved him enough to do whatever it took to help him succeed.  **2)**  Without them, he would never have even met you. **3)**  You think that is all a fabrication.  Wow.  He's telling you his honest truth and you just can't believe and trust that he is right.  Why?  Because you are the one who really knows him, right?  \"I  think this is a fabrication\" ... what an infinite AH you must be to say that.  It's disgusting.  He probably feels like he owes his life to these friends (and he literally might since they took schedules to make sure he wasn't alone- why do you think they did that?) and your reply is that?  Who raised you this way?  **4)**  You don't say anything bad about these friends' sexual preference per se, but the homophobia is spilling out of your jealousy and insecurity.  **5)**  Your insecurity doesn't seem like it will end when you have successfully alienated him from these friends.  He works in an office with a pretty female?  He has to switch jobs.  He goes to the Starbucks on 9th but there's all female baristas?  Nope, that won't do.  I don't see this changing.  **6)**  Feeling the way you do about these friends' level of devotion to each other and the way your bf has tried to repay each of his friends for their kindness to him seems, for lack of a better word, shallow.  **7)** Finally, you feel bad that his friends helped him at a time when you weren't in his life because it makes you feel like his allegiance or his love will always be stronger for them and it, what, overshadows anything you have done for him?  A good partner would thank God that he had and has them in his life.  Your jealousy of their meaningful place in his life makes you ugly and I hope he starts to see it so he can run for the hills.  A good partner would know and trust that if you did get married he would put you #1 on his list of priorities.  That he would do anything for you because that is the person he learned to be from his amazing friends.  But, thankfully, I don't think you will ever see this to its fruition.  \n\n**YTA**", "So you want him to cut out three people that have been through thick and thin with him because you think they all want your man?

You're minimizing everything about this man. Making it seem like he'd be fine without his friends when he's clearly told you that they've done a lot for him. Just because his friends have sex with men doesn't mean they want to have sex with every man they see, including your bf.", "YTA and you will lose him if you keep pushing it. Either you trust him or you don't. Believe it or not friends really do stand up and help each other. While I don't agree with the cheating he still had the support of his friends and you want him to choose you over them because you are insecure.   \n\n\nPerhaps you should work through your own issues before you push him away completely.", "YTA. Keep this shit up, and he'll pick them over you. They are there for him and they believe in friendship. You just may not be the right person for him if you don't. Open up to the possibility that there are good, healthy human relationships that are not based on sexual self-interest. Just as a possibility that there may be good things that exist even if you haven't been lucky enough to experience them firsthand. If he takes time off to look for his friend's dog, try to be there right by his side helping him help his friend. Be a partner.", "YTA. It sounds like he has some incredible friends who helped him through a really rough time. Aside from him being nice to them, do you have any proof that something is happening?", "YTA and way too immature for this guy. He and his friends value one another and their unconditional support. Everything you have and offer comes with conditions. You should spend less time worrying about his healthy friendships and more time worrying about your own toxic behavior. Why are you with someone you don\u2019t even believe, anyway?", "I'm going with fake. No one is this stupid that supposedly went to... Yale I think they said.", "YTA. They ARE his family.", "You can either trust him or not ..... Choose", "YTA to him and to yourself. Your insecurities are going to ruin this relationship if you let them. You need to deal with them or it will become a self fulfilling prophecy.", "YTA. Based on the timeline, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a rising junior or senior, probably 20 or 21. I was a goober at that age, too, but I still had enough emotional intelligence to know that trying to cut my boyfriend (who recently lost his only family, battled depression and addiction, and was trying to finish a degree at an extremely competitive school) off from his support system was careless at best, abusive at worst. \n\nAlso, your boyfriend is probably pretty smart. I hope for your sake he hasn\u2019t realized that you think so little of him that you automatically assume anyone who helps him just wants to get in his pants. I wouldn\u2019t count on it, though. \n\nOh, and speaking of counting: Service dogs take *years* (and frequently thousands of dollars) to train and match with someone. A week to find a stolen service dog \u2014 not sure why you think the \u201cstolen\u201d part negates the issue \u2014 is something most people with a moral center would not bat an eye at. \n\nDoes Yale offer student counseling? If so, do avail yourself.", "If he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, why should you care. Is he fucking them, no, then be happy he has good friends.

You should show him this also.", "Not everyone's mind works in nefarious ways the way yours does. You're projecting. YTA", "YTA. Not many people can have relationships like your BF and his friends. It's rare because it's hard. Just because you've never experienced anything like that does not mean it does not exist. There are friends who will absolutely drop everything and do whatever they can within their power to help their closest friends. I would have done this for a friend, especially in high school when there are no adult burdens. I am confident with my answer because I was raised that way by my grandmother.\n\nETA, changing my answer from soft yta to YTA because a reply seemed devoid of empathy.", "YTA, by a country mile.\n\nHis friends sound amazing, and so does he. How can you read what you've written and not see that every problem in your post originates from your own insecurities?\n\nCan you really not comprehend the idea that someone can care for a friend without wanting to date them?\n\nYou also shouldn't compare yourself to his friends like you are, this isn't a competition.\n\nIt's a good thing he has close friends he can rely on.\n\nLove isn't a zero sum game.\n\nI drive 2 hours (there and back) to spend time with my friends every other week.\n\nA week putting up flyers to help save a lost dog? I'd do that shit even if I barely knew you.\n\nI love my friends, I want to spend time with them, and make sure they're happy.

You\u2019re playing a losing game here, and if you don\u2019t accept the fact that your boyfriend isn\u2019t gonna give up his family for you you\u2019re gonna lose him.\n\nYou\u2019ll never have the same kind of connection with them he does, but if you sort yourself out and apologize in the best way possible, you might still be able to salvage your relationship with him and develop your own unique bond.\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely unless you change a lot of things very quickly and do a lot of work on your own about why you feel so hostile toward them and insecure in yourself.", "Girl I\u2019m all for fuck girl friends and anyone who I think likes my bf but you\u2019re tripping soooooooo bad.

They\u2019re so real for that.", "Yes you are sexualising his relationship with his friends. INFO: do you believe that people can be platonic friends with people in the gender they are interested in? If yes, then why are you asking this in the first place?", "YTA. Why would you assume that his friends only want to help him because theyare sexually into him? And even if they were - have any of them ever made a move? It doesn't sounds like that. On the contrary: they sound like a group of devoted friends. And you're basically asking your boyfriend to distrust their motives and to distance himself for the people who helped him when he was all f\\*cked up.\n\nAlso: why in the world would you object to your boyfriend being close friends with men who are gay or bi? Do you distrus them because of their sexualality? That's rather discriminatory. Do you think that you, in turn, can't be friends with any male?", "YTA and apparently don\u2019t have good friends.", "The fact you don't have friends you'd do this for or friends that wouldn't do this for you screams you're a horrible human being. I've  went 4 states out just to see my friend and that was literally for 3 hours. I don't expect you to know what it's like to have friends like that but treating him like you do shows you wouldn't deserve friends like that anyways", "Are any of these real anymore", "WTF.  \nBeing gay doesn't mean that you're going to hit on every single person of the same gender as yours, even *childhood friends.*  \nPlus, why are you scrutinizing every single exchange they have? And why would you call anything 'fabrication'. If he was ready to spend a lot of time/money/energy for any of his three friends, doesn't it prove that they did something beautiful for them and he thinks he owes them a lot.  \n\n\n>if his teachers knew he was struggling after his mom passed away but was normally a good student, they wouldn\u2019t have failed him but whatever.\n\nA teacher is a total stranger, who on top of all has whole classes to manage. Who had the more chances to notice the problem and help, the overworked stranger, or the childhood friend?  \nAt this point you're just trying to demonize his friends. You sound like a narcissist, someone who will start by wanting to isolate him to manipulate him better.
