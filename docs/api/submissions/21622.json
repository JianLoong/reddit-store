{"id": 21622, "submission_id": "14to84w", "title": "AITA for keeping my daughter's rose garden in the living room despite my son's allergies?", "selftext": "My (45F) daughter Felice (19F) absolutely loves flowers and has always wanted her own garden. Our complex doesn't allow outdoor gardens, so I surprised her by buying a nice indoor miniature rose kit for her birthday. She spent a great deal of time and effort into prepping the environment and cultivating them until they reached full bloom. They're super pretty, and every time we have visitors someone compliments her on them.\n\nHowever, I noticed my son Matthew seemed to be coming down with something. At first I just figured he had a cold but it lasted way too long for that. I also noticed he'd do just about anything to avoid the living room, even to the point of skipping meals rather than sit in the dining room (which is directly adjacent to the living room). I finally asked him what he thinks he's doing, and he admitted he thinks he's probably allergic to Felice's roses.\n\nI told Felice about Matthew's allergies but she pointed out that roses are typically hypoallergenic and maybe it's something else in the house he's allergic to (I didn't think it was likely, though; literally the only potential allergent are the roses). I brought up the idea that we might have to move the roses, but she can't think of anywhere else they can go, and neither can I. Our house is fairly small and all the rooms are close together. So I told her to just consider Matthew's allergies and left it that.\n\nLast night Matthew asked me if I could please move the roses somewhere else. I told him I could sympathize with his situation but he'd have to ask Felice, as I wasn't willing to just axe all her hard work. He told me he had asked her but she refused. I told him there was nothing else I could do. Matthew got angry and said I was taking Felice's side \u201clike I always do.\u201d I told him I wasn't on anybody's side, they just had to work this one out for themselves. I offered to buy him some more anti-histamines but he just walked out cursing and has been in a bad mood towards me ever since.\n\nRight now I need some outside opinions: AITA for not caving in and moving Felice's garden? Most likely i'd have had to remove it entirely and I would've felt horrible knowing how hard she worked and how proud she is of it.\n\nUPDATE: I've arranged to have my sister buy the roses. This way, my girl gets compensated for her hard work, the roses aren't destroyed, and my son can get some relief. I'm going to have some cleaners over so the house is purified, so to speak, 'til then I'll have my son stay at my mom's. This thread is wild, I don't know what else to say. Call CPS? I'm a POS and a lady part? And I thought there was a civility rule, lol. That said, you gotta have thick skin if you're gonna post here, and it did kind of snap me out of being uncertain and now I've got a great solution.

You move the three adults around so that your son and daughter are in the rooms furthest away from each other. You take the room in the middle. You get a great air purifier for your son's room. Maybe one for the living room downstairs, too. The door to your daughter's room has to remain closed at all times. She has to be conscientious about what clothes she wears when she's working with the roses--after gardening she needs to shower, change clothes and keep that door shut. You also take your son to an allergist and get him tested and allergy drops to reduce sensitivity.\n\nAnd if none of that works, or your daughter balks at the extra work she has to do, she gets rid of the roses.", "YTA.

From that moment on, I had severe seasonal allergies twice a year every year until I got a prescription for a modern allergy medicine.

Our complex doesn't allow outdoor gardens, so I surprised her by buying a nice indoor miniature rose kit for her birthday. She spent a great deal of time and effort into prepping the environment and cultivating them until they reached full bloom. They're super pretty, and every time we have visitors someone compliments her on them.\n\nHowever, I noticed my son Matthew seemed to be coming down with something. At first I just figured he had a cold but it lasted way too long for that. I also noticed he'd do just about anything to avoid the living room, even to the point of skipping meals rather than sit in the dining room (which is directly adjacent to the living room). I finally asked him what he thinks he's doing, and he admitted he thinks he's probably allergic to Felice's roses.\n\nI told Felice about Matthew's allergies but she pointed out that roses are typically hypoallergenic and maybe it's something else in the house he's allergic to (I didn't think it was likely, though; literally the only potential allergent are the roses). I brought up the idea that we might have to move the roses, but she can't think of anywhere else they can go, and neither can I. Our house is fairly small and all the rooms are close together. So I told her to just consider Matthew's allergies and left it that.\n\nLast night Matthew asked me if I could please move the roses somewhere else. I told him I could sympathize with his situation but he'd have to ask Felice, as I wasn't willing to just axe all her hard work. He told me he had asked her but she refused. I told him there was nothing else I could do. Matthew got angry and said I was taking Felice's side \u201clike I always do.\u201d I told him I wasn't on anybody's side, they just had to work this one out for themselves. I offered to buy him some more anti-histamines but he just walked out cursing and has been in a bad mood towards me ever since.\n\nRight now I need some outside opinions: AITA for not caving in and moving Felice's garden? Most likely i'd have had to remove it entirely and I would've felt horrible knowing how hard she worked and how proud she is of it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And you are absolutely correct, of course.", "Yes, along with pollen and assorted other allergies.  I also have what is considered an allergy to smells that cause instant migraine.
