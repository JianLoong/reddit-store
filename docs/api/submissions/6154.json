{"id": 6154, "submission_id": "10091aj", "title": "AITA For purposely giving a classmate wrong information, which caused her to do badly on her final and potentially be rejected from her dream college?", "selftext": "I\u2019m a junior in high school and have a college prep class with a girl named \u201cKate.\u201d Kate only talks to me when she needs homework help. Every Monday and Wednesday in our college prep class, we get into groups by subject and help tutor each other. Kate and I were the only people in the Earth Science group so she just expected me to let her copy. It got to the point where Kate wouldn\u2019t even bother trying to do the homework. She would show up with a blank worksheet/study guide and just copied all my answers.\n\nI\u2019ve told Kate many times before that I don\u2019t feel comfortable with letting her copy, since it\u2019s basically cheating. Kate kept insisting that our teacher wouldn\u2019t notice since we\u2019re in different periods and basically implied that I have nothing else going on and should just do all the work for her. Whenever I try talking to our college prep teacher about it, Kate lies that she doesn\u2019t understand the material and she doesn\u2019t know where to get started on the homework. So then my teacher will tell me to just keep \u201chelping\u201d Kate because students help each other in college and I\u2019ll always need to work with others.\n\nI got sick of this, so I made a plan. Our Earth Science final was worth 20% of our total grade (we\u2019re in honors) and you get a final study guide a month in advance. I got two copies of the study guide. I correctly filled out one and put completely wrong information on the other. The week before the final, Kate again didn\u2019t do any of the study guide, so I showed her my incorrect study guide and she copied all the wrong answers from there.\n\nWe returned from winter break on Monday and Kate immediately accused me of sabotaging her. Kate had completely bombed the final. Her A in the class had been borderline and she dropped to a C. I played dumb and said that I thought those were the right answers and I did well on the final so I\u2019m not sure what happened with her.\n\nI\u2019ve already overheard Kate telling people that our Earth Science teacher sabotaged her and that she\u2019s likely going to be rejected from her dream college over this. Kate didn\u2019t do as well in Chemistry last year and since she wants to study medicine, she knows she needs to have good grades in science.\n\nMy friends said I basically had no choice. Because I made it clear I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing all the work for Kate yet my college prep teacher wouldn\u2019t do anything about it. But my sister told me I was an asshole because no student has gotten through college without helping one another and since I\u2019m more mature than most kids my age I could have stopped letting Kate leech off of me without \"sabotaging her future.\"\n\nI agreed that yeah, college students need to help **each other.** In college, the teachers won\u2019t force everyone else to carry Kate. And I feel that Kate sabotaged herself. She\u2019s not going to have a career in medicine or get through college anyway if she keeps being a leech and blaming others. But some other people are agreeing with my sister, so AITA?\n\nI want to clarify again that I have tried in the past to refuse to show Kate my answers, but then she'll lie to my college prep teacher that she doesn't understand the material and I'm refusing to help her, so then he'll force me to just let Kate see my complete worksheet and give her the answers.", "created_utc": 1672537446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10091aj/aita_for_purposely_giving_a_classmate_wrong/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
