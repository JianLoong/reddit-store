Every Monday and Wednesday in our college prep class, we get into groups by subject and help tutor each other. Kate and I were the only people in the Earth Science group so she just expected me to let her copy. It got to the point where Kate wouldn\u2019t even bother trying to do the homework. She would show up with a blank worksheet/study guide and just copied all my answers.\n\nI\u2019ve told Kate many times before that I don\u2019t feel comfortable with letting her copy, since it\u2019s basically cheating. Kate kept insisting that our teacher wouldn\u2019t notice since we\u2019re in different periods and basically implied that I have nothing else going on and should just do all the work for her. Whenever I try talking to our college prep teacher about it, Kate lies that she doesn\u2019t understand the material and she doesn\u2019t know where to get started on the homework. So then my teacher will tell me to just keep \u201chelping\u201d Kate because students help each other in college and I\u2019ll always need to work with others.\n\nI got sick of this, so I made a plan. Our Earth Science final was worth 20% of our total grade (we\u2019re in honors) and you get a final study guide a month in advance. I got two copies of the study guide. I correctly filled out one and put completely wrong information on the other. The week before the final, Kate again didn\u2019t do any of the study guide, so I showed her my incorrect study guide and she copied all the wrong answers from there.\n\nWe returned from winter break on Monday and Kate immediately accused me of sabotaging her. Kate had completely bombed the final. Her A in the class had been borderline and she dropped to a C. I played dumb and said that I thought those were the right answers and I did well on the final so I\u2019m not sure what happened with her.\n\nI\u2019ve already overheard Kate telling people that our Earth Science teacher sabotaged her and that she\u2019s likely going to be rejected from her dream college over this. Kate didn\u2019t do as well in Chemistry last year and since she wants to study medicine, she knows she needs to have good grades in science.\n\nMy friends said I basically had no choice. Because I made it clear I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing all the work for Kate yet my college prep teacher wouldn\u2019t do anything about it. But my sister told me I was an asshole because no student has gotten through college without helping one another and since I\u2019m more mature than most kids my age I could have stopped letting Kate leech off of me without \"sabotaging her future.\"\n\nI agreed that yeah, college students need to help **each other.** In college, the teachers won\u2019t force everyone else to carry Kate. And I feel that Kate sabotaged herself. She\u2019s not going to have a career in medicine or get through college anyway if she keeps being a leech and blaming others. But some other people are agreeing with my sister, so AITA?\n\nI want to clarify again that I have tried in the past to refuse to show Kate my answers, but then she'll lie to my college prep teacher that she doesn't understand the material and I'm refusing to help her, so then he'll force me to just let Kate see my complete worksheet and give her the answers.", "created_utc": 1672537446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10091aj/aita_for_purposely_giving_a_classmate_wrong/", "score": 287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In some courses at uni you have to do group assignments but it\u2019s not that one student gets the work done for free.  Your teacher is absolutely terrible and either lazy or corrupt to treat you this way, putting it on to you to teach or even share information with another student.", "NTA.\n\nKate is TA.\nSister is TA.\nCollege prep teacher the biggest TA of all.\n\nINFO: other than force students to allow others to plagiarize other students' work, does your college prep teacher actually do anything that constitutes teaching?", "ESH. If you don\u2019t want her to cheat/copy, say it to her face. She f\u2019ed around and found out.", "YTA\n\nI get it. She isn't entitled to anyone else's work, she should work for the grade she wants and anybody who cheats should understand it comes with the risk of failure and/or punishment. I understand your frustration, but it's not your job to teach her a lesson about cheating. And if you're going to do something like that, at least own up to it. You're never going to be able to control what other people say or do. You can *only* control yourself and the way you respond to others' behavior, so focus on that. What you did here isn't going to stop her from cheating in the future, it'll only reflect poorly on you. In her head she didn't fail because she cheated, she failed because you sabotaged her. You didn't teach her not to cheat, you taught her not to trust *you*. It's not your problem to fix that she cheats, it's your problem to fix that you won't pushback when she is pushy, or in front of your teacher when she lies. It sounds like your teacher is under the impression you are helping her or working together because NO teacher would be okay with, let alone encourage, a student blatantly copying others' work just because they didn't feel like doing it themself. So make it clear to this girl \"if you don't stop asking me, I am going to go to our teacher and tell him you've been blatantly cheating off of me without trying yourself. It's not what I want to do so please stop asking me, there are other people you can ask.\" Just as you could've told her before your exam, \"If you insist on copying my answers, I insist on them being wrong.\"", "ESH.\n\nKate sucks for leeching off you.\n\nYour teacher sucks for making you share your work with Kate when she wasn\u2019t even trying.\n\nBut you also suck for lying and falsifying the study sheet.", "100% YTA. It's one thing to stop helping someone. It's another to intentionally sabotage them.  If you were interviewing with my company and I heard you did this, I'd end the interview right then and there, and tell you to leave.", "Also if she got caught cheating in college and got dragged before an honor committee, the ramifications are much bigger than getting a C in Earth Science.\n\n(Will Kate learn from this experience and actually avoid future run ins with an honor committee? Who knows. But maybe she'll pick a major or career that she actually likes something about other than the prestige and the paycheck.)", "Came her to say that I do not want my future doctors to have cheated their way into med school.", "Wow I didn\u2019t even think that far. Our actions really do have far-reaching consequences! Y", "Also, how did she have all the grades she needed to get into her dream school. OP can't be the only person she cheated.", "A complete sentence! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "I agree; OP should've just said no.", "I agree. He could have just not brought the study sheet at all so there would be nothing for her to copy.", "NTA you are a legend\ud83e\udd23", "NTA, but why didn\u2019t you go directly to the Earth Science teacher?"]}
