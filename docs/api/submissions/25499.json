She frequently says she will never go through another pregnancy ever again. Ever. When my brother, her husband, brings up having another baby, she says absolutely not. So they're done. \n\nMy husband and I have been discussing names for our second son. We decided on Luke for a name, and after talking about it, we thought to ask my brother and SIL their thoughts on it because of how close it is to Lucas. My brother said it was totally fine, but my SIL said we absolutely cannot use it because it's a nickname for her boy name. She said because it is what she would've named her son if she had had one, the name is hers. No one else in the family can use it. I asked if she was planning on using it down the road if she had another baby, and she said no, because she doesn't want any more kids. \n\nOn one hand, I realize that this may be a sort of grieving for not having a son, but on the other, would it be an AH move to use the name? Please advise. Be honest.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the honest feedback, I appreciate it. Some asked why we even decided to ask her; well, we didn't want to just catch them off guard and name our son Luke.

You knew deep down that it might cause issues because you knew it was close to that name and went out of your way to ask for her opinion. It might be unreasonable to claim a name of a non-existing child, but it still goes deep for her. If you end up ignoring her and do this anyways, then why ask for her opinion in the first place?", "YTA, if you didn\u2019t want them to say no, you shouldn\u2019t have asked.\n\nBut you asked.

Sure.\n\nBut are you deliberately harming your grieving, clearly a bit mental SIL and fostering what will likely be a lifetime of resentment that will disrupt your family for the foreseeable future?

But you know that your choice was a bit of a time bomb, which was why you went to ask your SIL for her blessing. Having gotten her reaction, you are now faced with a choice. You can ignore her feelings and name your son what you want, knowing deep down that it will affect not just your relationship with SIL but with your brother and your niece also. Right now, you may not want to believe that SIL can or will do anything when presented with a nephew named Luke. Given her reaction, though, there is no way there will not be a fallout. Or, you can choose a different name for your coming son and avoid the drama altogether. It is not as if the child will ever know.", "NTA. Don't let imaginary demands rule your real life.

Do you really think you\u2019ll continue to love that name above all others (or that HE will) when his aunt has bad energy about it?

You could use the name without being TA, but it doesn\u2019t exactly seem like a win.", "NTA\n\nshe stated she is not having any more kids so why hold on to that name BUT please be aware naming your child Luke will most likely trigger some serious issues - resentment to you, her daughter, everyone. And it won't be pretty. I don't say this to sway you but consider that it may be a problem in the future.", "Luke is a name on it's own, and I have never known a Lucas that used it, either, I just want to put that here.", "NTA - if they were planning on having a kid in the near future it would be a soft AH move to do seeing as it was agreed upon. In this case, there is a definite plan to not have more children and that request is nonsensical by its very nature.

The SIL doesn't own the name Lucas or any derivative of it.  I have two boys and my sister has two girls . She used our grandmother's name for the youngest daughter's middle name.  As I don't have a daughter I said she could use the name( knowing I had wanted to name a daughter of my own after my grandmother). It's now a common name so if I were to have a daughter I might not use the name anyway.  I used less common names with my kids and my own name isn't common.  Personal preference.

Your SIL is full of it.", "ESH - she\u2019s an AH for gatekeeping a name that she will never use and the only loss she experienced is the imagination of her having a boy. \n\nYou asking her permission and then just ignoring her no is an AH move. Better to ask for forgiveness than permission.", "The Y T As are weird. OP also liked this name originally and chose a different one out of respect (which is weird because more than one person can have the same name) but if SIL is never having another kid, she doesn\u2019t get dibs on a name for a never to exist child. Also it\u2019s not even the OG name, it\u2019s a nickname of said name. NTA.", "NTA but you blew it when you asked them.", "NTA.\n\nIf you decide that's the name you really want, use it.  She can't call dibs on a name, it doesn't work that way.", "This. It's not about being an AH, it's about whether this one name out of millions is important enough to OP to ruin her relationship with her SIL (and potentially her brother, if SIL causes enough of a fuss) over it. Because yes, SIL is absolutely being ridiculous . . . but at the end of the day it's not going to matter. The ridiculous, stubborn, childish person is absolutely not going to let go of this, and it WILL cause massive family tension as a best-case scenario, and possibly a permanent rift. Is it really worth that nightmare of a mess over a name?", "This is an excellent point. I was going to say that OP is N-T-A but shouldn't do it anyway just because it's pointless shit-disturbing. But you make an excellent point that if she intended to disregard her SIL's feelings if they didn't align with what she wanted, then she shouldn't have asked for them. Asking her SIL if she was okay with it, and then ignoring her (even if SIL is being ridiculous) is an AH move. If you don't care how she feels, don't ask for her input.", "Exactly. This is why you don't ask permission. Or tell people your baby names until after the kid is born. SIL is being ridiculous though", "NTA. She is a bot off her rocker. No one owns a name and to try to do so is a sign of mental illness.", "NTA\n\nPeople can't claim names for their babies and tell everyone in their family that they can't use it - they especially can't claim a name when they've specifically stated they aren't going to have any more children and are **never** going to use the name and more especially so when it is a variation on the name.  Claiming a nickname is even more stupid than claiming a name.\n\nThere are literally thousands of families in the world where cousins have the same name as each other - its a real thing.", "Name your son Luke, ignore your SIL.

Don\u2019t trivialize them now. \n\nIf you really want the name, talk to her further. Explain that little Luke would be a part of her family just like a son would\u2019ve been. Tell her she can have exclusive rights to use \u2018Lucas\u2019 as her nephews nickname and that can be their little thing. Turn the name into a reason to smile, instead of a memory of a preference disregarded.", "It's not worth it to use the name if it's really that important to my SIL. There's been more than enough unnecessary tension since we found out what each of us was having, and it's probably still just a sore spot for her. I guess she could always ultimately change her mind if she really wants a boy down the road.", "Sounds slightly malicious, theres plenty of other names. OP knows its going to cause trouble.. why bother?", "I'm sure humans have terrible memories so that they forget how awful pregnancy and child birth can be.   My suspicion is that the SIL may change her mind in the future and try for the much wanted son.   To noone but the SIL would you be the A but since you asked and she said no then choose another name."]}
