So this is deadly serious, literally.

Your note, where you only describe that it\u2019s a separate location that he shouldn\u2019t have been at, and that there was a time difference of at least a few hours, is simply not enough to protect someone with a severe allergy, and having someone around you be careless about your allergy is simply dangerous and quite frightening.

It is *unlikely* to transfer enough gluten for a reaction, but it is possible. Anything that gets gluten to the digestive tract can trigger celiac, principally eating, or inhaling it. Allergies can be triggered in many more ways. Contact with skin or eyes, ingestion, inhalation, injection, and insect stings, to name the most common. I've had allergies my entire life, though I outgrew my only food allergies by my teens. I had my first allegy tests over 50 years ago.

However, the reason posters are more inclined to believe boyfriend's mother over him is beacuse the only other example we have of boyfriend's behavior is him acting shockingly unreasonably.\n\nIt is, as you allude to above, possible to be an AH and to have allergies.
