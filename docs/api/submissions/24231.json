If you eat the cake during lunch, and do not adequately clean your mouth, clothing and hands, depending on his allergic reaction (how allergic he is) when he sees you at 6PM that day, he could go into anaphylaxis (that\u2019s when someone\u2019s throat closes and without immediate medical intervention they can no longer breath). So this is deadly serious, literally. Someone who has an allergy, especially one that can result in anaphylactic shock, learns to protect themselves physically, because the sad truth is that other people and even family members can dismiss it - even when it\u2019s quite dangerous.

Your note, where you only describe that it\u2019s a separate location that he shouldn\u2019t have been at, and that there was a time difference of at least a few hours, is simply not enough to protect someone with a severe allergy, and having someone around you be careless about your allergy is simply dangerous and quite frightening.
