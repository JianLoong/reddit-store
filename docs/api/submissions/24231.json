I\u2019m also fairly sure they\u2019ve kissed and had sex after she\u2019s eaten PB sometime earlier in the day. She\u2019d know by now if it was that severe.

If this was a story about crazy mom and normal boyfriend, people would likely being doubting her.\n\nBut no one seems to read it as I keep receiving notifications of people disagreeing with my trust in a mother I don't know based on a singular story, because their own mother blablablablaaaaa... Listen, I don't really care about *your* story and I well know that some parents are dismissing of such things, and I'm still horrified about that Reddit' story of a grandmother who killed her granddaughter because she wouldn't believe in coconut allergy. \n\nBut here, it isn't that, and it is just judgement on an AITA story, and I stay firm on that judgement. \n\nTrust isn't about fairness or anything like that, trust is about feelings and instinct. I trust my instinct. We are not talking about any of you here nor your parents, but about a guy who didn't see any doctors for his pretending allergy and didn't show any allergic signs ever or even just got a crisis story to tell to his girlfriend... That's all in OP's response to comment and seems to validate my judgement, don't you think ?", "NTA. Eating it around him would be uncool because of allergies. Him expecting you to veto peanut butter from your diet entirely because he's allergic is stupid. It's like a lactose intolerant person getting mad at anyone eating ice cream. He's the one who'll suffer, not you. He's trying to extend his suffering. If you want, sit down and talk to him about this. \"I'm not allergic. I like peanut butter. I'm willing to make sure I don't have residue or anything on me when I'm with you, but I'm not willing to eradicate peanuts from my diet entirely because I'm not allergic. It's not disrespectful of me to eat something you can't, but it sure as shit is overbearing and controlling for you to tell me what I CAN'T do/eat because of your food issues.\" \n\nIt's not selfish to enjoy something and to have it.

I think his main problem is that by you even buying anything with pb in it, he feels like you're leaving him out. I guess you could say he's got FOMO and thinks that in order for you to be considerate toward him, you have to stop eating anything peanut related so he doesn't feel left out. It's his problem, not yours. It's just way too much work to cater to his needs 24/7, and you need to ask him whether he caters to your needs 24/7. Of course we all know the answer to that, but hopefully it'll help put things into perspective for him.", "NTA.  You bought it for yourself, and you'd have brushed your teeth.

If you eat the cake during lunch, and do not adequately clean your mouth, clothing and hands, depending on his allergic reaction (how allergic he is) when he sees you at 6PM that day, he could go into anaphylaxis (that\u2019s when someone\u2019s throat closes and without immediate medical intervention they can no longer breath). So this is deadly serious, literally. Someone who has an allergy, especially one that can result in anaphylactic shock, learns to protect themselves physically, because the sad truth is that other people and even family members can dismiss it - even when it\u2019s quite dangerous. For example, my mother doesn\u2019t regularly forgets about a key medication allergy that I have, even though she was physically present in the emergency room over a decade ago as a doctor had to inject me multiple times to stop my throat from closing, and the doctor himself told my mother that this was a severe allergy. Your note, where you only describe that it\u2019s a separate location that he shouldn\u2019t have been at, and that there was a time difference of at least a few hours, is simply not enough to protect someone with a severe allergy, and having someone around you be careless about your allergy is simply dangerous and quite frightening.

She stood in the kitchen and sniffed the bread for half a minute before they gave it to the kids. I feel her pain. I\u2019m allergic to chocolate and do the same on occasion.", "Hi celiac sibling! My kids regularly ask if I want to sniff their food. lol", "Also Celiac and do the same thing, especially with my husband's IPA beers. I couldn't imagine banning him from eating things because I can't enjoy them!", "I\u2019m allergic to pork. I love the smell of bacon. Sometimes when friends or family are eating it I lean extra close to smell it. Last week I decided to test if I\u2019m still allergic. After a miserable few days I confirmed I still am.", "My relatives all have instructions that if I\u2019m on life support they can feed me pineapple upside down cake and a pi\u00f1a colada instead of pulling the plug. I\u2019ll die happy. In the meantime, I\u2019m not gonna deny anyone else.", "I\u2019m allergic to capsaicin and I feel the \u201cjust let me smell it\u201d part of food allergies/sensitivity so much", "cheese sticks... oven rolls... let me squish and smell please....", "I love the image of you just huffing his sandwich XD", "Allergies can also be outgrown and change over time. Anyone who hads a serious food allergy needs to be under the care of an allergist, be allergy tested, and carry an epi pen. If the boyfriend does none of this then he may very well not have an allergy. I have a mild allergy to shrimp and even I see an allergist and carry an epi pen just in case because allergies can get worse at any time.", "Gluten-free baking has come a long way. I can make VERY good crusty French bread now, and those squishy Hawaiian rolls, to name  a couple of things. Psyllium husk is my favorite \"secret ingredient\".", "Mine is this severe but I still allow my kids to pet cats.", "I got the gluten free roll at dave and busters and ended up with a patty in my hands and a deconstructed mess of a bun on my plate, lol.", "I was diagnosed in 1997. There were few gluten free items available and most of them were horrible. The bread for my first sandwich  crumbled like sawdust when I picked it up. I sat and cried.\n\nThings are much better now with the good selection of decent GF products and more restaurants taking us seriously.", "Have you heard of Gluten Free on a Shoestring?  That website has fabulous recipes, including ones for mixes.", "Stop I am going to cry", "I was diagnosed earlier this year. I am still in mourning for Tim Tams.", "Had a boyfriend back before lactose free items were developed. He was craving ice cream, but, well...you know. He was thrilled when we realized the Cool Whip in the freezer and a little chocolate syrup was non-dairy and the texture was close enough to satisfy that craving.", "Mine is bagels. Gf matzo is satisfactory, gf bagels are not. If someone eats a good bagel with lox in front of me when I'm craving one. Ooooh boy.", "It'll be ok. It'll suck at first, but then only periodically, and you'll be ok.", "Lol I remember the speech at Cabot. They seem so pleased with themselves for not having lactose.", "Trust is about feelings and instinct. I trust my instinct. We are not talking about you here, nor your brother from the same mother, but about a guy who didn't see any doctors for his pretending allergy, don't have any epi-pen and didn't show any allergic signs ever or even just got a crisis story to tell to his girlfriend...", "I trust my instinct. We are not talking about you here nor your parents, but about a guy who didn't see any doctors for his pretending allergy and didn't show any allergic signs ever or even just got a crisis story to tell to his girlfriend...", "I'm not the first in my family to be diagnosed, and judging by my youngest's nappies, I won't be the last. My brother has already given me his \"welcome pack\". \n\nBut damn, I miss sneaking off to my best friend's house and scoffing down some Tim Tams without the kids knowing."]}
