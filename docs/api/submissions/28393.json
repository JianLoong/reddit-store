I went to go visit my father for a few weeks and came back home where I lived with my mom. I came back to my room completely devoid of all my toys, teddy bears, and games. I went to my mom to ask her what had happened and my step parent and her started laughing and told me that they threw everything out. My doll house that my dad had built me was gone and all of my childhood memories including my bike was as well. I asked them why and they said that I was an adult now and adults didn\u2019t play with toys. I went back to my room and cried and honestly that was the day I felt like everything had changed for me. The next few years were filled with a lot of trauma and isolation and I didn\u2019t quite get to live the life of an average teenager because of the fear I felt in that household. I was also very defensive with my items and would hide things regularly to keep them safe. \n\nA few years later my mom and step parent inevitably got divorced and I now live with her at 20 years old because of the economy. I can\u2019t afford college anymore but I\u2019m working a full time job to save up to start classes again and hopefully move out. I\u2019m also currently in therapy and got diagnosed with ADHD over the summer. My therapist has been working with me to dismantle the anxieties and traumas  from my teenagehood. I had opened up to her about what had happened when I was 12 and how I missed just being able to play and escape the world around me. She fully encouraged me to get back into things and find happiness through play. So I started buying and collecting Barbies again which were my favorite toy. I kept this private from my mom because I knew she wouldn\u2019t be supportive at all. So I kept them in a bin under my bed so no one could see. That was until she came into my room yesterday while I was reorganizing and saw the bin out from under the bed. \n\nShe immediately got freaked out and asked me whose toys they were. I decided to be honest and told her they were mine and my therapist had suggested it. She immediately got angry and asked me when I was going to grow up. She went on and on about how adults don\u2019t play with toys and I must have something seriously wrong with me. The breaking point came when she tried to grab the box and told me she was gonna throw them out. I think this is where I\u2019m really the AH because I started screaming at her to stop and just leave me alone. She then threw the bin down on the floor and called me a disrespectful little girl before walking out. She is giving me the silent treatment today and I just feel completely embarrassed and ashamed of myself and I\u2019m considering throwing the toys out now.", "created_utc": 1696645436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171uwlp/aita_for_playing_with_dolls_as_an_adult/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let me tell you a (not so) secret - I'm 54, a mother of 2 grown sons and I still have dolls. I move them around, pose them, and have a wonderful time doing it. I still play with Legos, I love Disney things. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with having dolls & playing with them. A friend of mine is in his 60's and still plays with model trains.\n\nYour mother and former step-parent were wrong to have thrown out those toys all those years ago, and your mother is wrong now. If they bring you happiness keep them. But I do suggest getting a lock on your door, or some kind of secure storage to prevent your mother from repeating her past sins.\n\nYou are so NTA in this situation, and my heart bleeds for you.", "You can play with toys and have an imaginary friend and play in a sandbox at any age.  I might draw the line at sucking on a pacifier but so long as you don't do it out in public then who cares?", "how does playing with toys and fighting against an abusive household (nonphysically) make you an asshole? NTA, you\u2019ve done the best and most sensible thing, congrats", "OP \u2014 i am so sorry that your mom broke your trust and that you were not able to feel safe with her or trust her. 12 was absolutely not an adult. That was so messed up and unnecessary. It\u2019s sadistic and evil, really.\n\nAnd go play with Barbies all you want! Adults play all the time. I mean, video games?? Adults also collect different things that make them happy \u2014 plants, books, perfume, plush toys, beanies, manga, stationery, pens, figurines, thimbles, you name it, and yes, even dolls ans Barbies! You\u2019re totally fine. You do whatever is needed to heal your trauma. I hope you\u2019re able to get out of your mom\u2019s house soon.", "NTA. A huge amount of adults play with toys and dolls, so your mom is wrong. You did good by standing up for yourself, and she should show you respect as an adult AND as a child (when she broke your heart by throwing out your possessions that you loved) by minding her own business. There's nothing wrong with getting in touch with your inner child.", "NTA\n\nI'm 40, I have a 3D printer I use to print old scans of 80s and 90s TMNT figures. I also play Warhammer 40K and collect DBZ models.\n\nThese are all toys in my opinion.\n\nSometimes when I clean up my niece and nephew's room I'll play with their toys, action figures or whatever.\n\nI also have over $3K worth of Lego.\n\nWhen I call my best friend I ask him if he wants to play. Sometimes it's video games, board games, D&D, pickle ball, we even started sword fighting with those practice swords you can get. \n\nThe coolest people do what they want, not what is expected by society. Keep being cool. Hold on to your inner child. Your Mother sounds miserable.", "What a weird thing to do as a parent. NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t play with my toys, but I collect and have amassed some cool things. Legos are my favorite as an adult and I still pose and play with the minifigs and all that. I\u2019m 41.", "NTA\n\nOf course not.  She was about to re-enact a core trauma from your past.  I would've power bombed her.", "NTA\n\nOP you ARE an adult and you have used YOUR money to pay for these. What your mum tells you is  irrelevant. If you want to play with barbie then have the best time and enjoy yourself, she does not get to dictate how you spend your own money!", "Your mom is being abusive, and you are NTA. She likely reacted that way and tried to throw out your dolls to absolve her guilt at how they treated you as a child. Doubling down is just a tactic to make you doubt yourself when she is clearly in the wrong. Get a lock on your door and maybe message her, saying in no uncertain terms that she is not allowed to touch or throw away any of your personal belongings and (if you're comfortable and safely able to) include a consequence you are able to enforce in order to maintain your boundaries. Best of luck.", "\"disrespectful little girl\" youre a grown ass woman and shes throwing a fit over you having a hobby. shes acting like a child, not you. adults play with and collect toys all the time. who the hell does she think designs the damn things? children?

I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s so intent on making you grow up. To tell you the truth I\u2019ve often thought about collecting dolls again because it gave me such joy when I was a child. I don\u2019t think this way of thinking is because I\u2019m immature. Sometimes we just have to hold onto the things that make us happy.", "Nta I think your therapist has given good advice. Your mother needs to see one.", "NTA - you playing with dolls hurts no one and you're having fun, you only live once and seriously, nothing wrong with enjoying life.  Her throwing a temper fit over some Barbies actually is pretty childish though.", "Please keep your Barbies <3\n\nNTA", "Hey OP,\nI\u2019m an adult, in my thirties with a toddler.

But I was so disappointed in the pile of wood in the garage for years.\n\nMy dad sent me 150 bucks for Christmas last year \nfor Christmas (catching the theme here?) And I bought myself a new miniature house that I've had a blast putting together and making all the furniture for. \n\nIt's not exactly playing with dolls, but it's reclaiming something for me. NTA. Enjoy.", "Don\u2019t throw out your Barbie\u2019s! I\u2019m almost 30, live with one of my partners and our house has a million toys in every room. I\u2019m childfree and they\u2019re all mine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being an adult and playing with toys!", "NTA \n\nHey Opie. You deserve to play. You deserve to laugh. You deserve to feel safe in your skin, your space, and your home. You deserve privacy and if you can get a lock or a door stopper, I fully advise you to. \n\nIf you're open to the idea, schedule time for care for yourself to be in a safe private place where you can process your emotions, and try out the show Bluey. It's been endlessly helpful to me. \n\nsimilar situation here, went into foster care and came back to there having been \"a lice infestation\" so most of my plushies were gone and a lot of clothes were too. A few years later the storage unit we had got repoed. Goodbye Xbox. Goodbye Wii.

Mementos filled with wasps and moths\n\nI hope that somehow your dolls ended up being loved by someone just the way you loved them before they were taken from you. i hope they made it out of the trash a la toy story. \n\nI hope you find peace, security, and education as soon as can be \ud83d\ude4f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They might also get a kick out of playing with their kids, or break out the Lego sets with their mates when they're all chilling and drinking at someone's house. It is sad when people hide it.
