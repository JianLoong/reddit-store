I went to go visit my father for a few weeks and came back home where I lived with my mom. I came back to my room completely devoid of all my toys, teddy bears, and games. I went to my mom to ask her what had happened and my step parent and her started laughing and told me that they threw everything out. My doll house that my dad had built me was gone and all of my childhood memories including my bike was as well. I asked them why and they said that I was an adult now and adults didn\u2019t play with toys. I went back to my room and cried and honestly that was the day I felt like everything had changed for me. The next few years were filled with a lot of trauma and isolation and I didn\u2019t quite get to live the life of an average teenager because of the fear I felt in that household. I was also very defensive with my items and would hide things regularly to keep them safe. \n\nA few years later my mom and step parent inevitably got divorced and I now live with her at 20 years old because of the economy. I can\u2019t afford college anymore but I\u2019m working a full time job to save up to start classes again and hopefully move out. I\u2019m also currently in therapy and got diagnosed with ADHD over the summer. My therapist has been working with me to dismantle the anxieties and traumas  from my teenagehood. I had opened up to her about what had happened when I was 12 and how I missed just being able to play and escape the world around me. She fully encouraged me to get back into things and find happiness through play. So I started buying and collecting Barbies again which were my favorite toy. I kept this private from my mom because I knew she wouldn\u2019t be supportive at all. So I kept them in a bin under my bed so no one could see. That was until she came into my room yesterday while I was reorganizing and saw the bin out from under the bed. \n\nShe immediately got freaked out and asked me whose toys they were. I decided to be honest and told her they were mine and my therapist had suggested it. She immediately got angry and asked me when I was going to grow up. She went on and on about how adults don\u2019t play with toys and I must have something seriously wrong with me. The breaking point came when she tried to grab the box and told me she was gonna throw them out. I think this is where I\u2019m really the AH because I started screaming at her to stop and just leave me alone. She then threw the bin down on the floor and called me a disrespectful little girl before walking out. She is giving me the silent treatment today and I just feel completely embarrassed and ashamed of myself and I\u2019m considering throwing the toys out now.", "created_utc": 1696645436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171uwlp/aita_for_playing_with_dolls_as_an_adult/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I still play with Legos, I love Disney things. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with having dolls & playing with them.

But in adulthood, I got great therapy and worked on healing (and even managed to repair my relationships with Dad and ex-stepmother).\n\nBut one of the most healing things for me was -- **just buying toys**. Giving myself that experience I needed, giving myself the gifts of what I had lost -- children's books. Kooky funny things I liked as a kid. I even bought a tiny clock that reminded me of the one from childhood. Etc.\n\n**That's what you're doing. You are healing the child you were**, healing the grief and loss you felt. Buy as many dolls as you want! Play with them, read children's book, don't judge yourself for wanting to replace what you lost. There is nothing wrong with play! Play is imagination. Today, it is a proud part of nerd culture! Cosplaying is dressing up in a costume for fun! Larping is playing let's pretend -- FOR FUN! Action figures? They're dolls grownups play with. For fun. Imagination is a fabulous thing.\n\nNever feel guilty for having an imagination.\n\nPlease take care of yourself, do NOT let your mother throw away single other possession of yours, and please TELL HER THAT in no uncertain terms. Tell her your things are your things, and that's that.\n\nTake care out there. And hang in there.\n\nPS -- Also, I'm worried she will throw your things out without your consent.

Really hope that you'll be able to move out soon.\n\nWhat your step dad did was a HUGE asshole move, seriously messed up \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA \n\nShe was incredibly cruel and disrespectful to throw out your belongings like that \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through that \n\nAnd there\u2019s absolutely no reason you shouldn\u2019t play with dolls \n\nThere\u2019s little enough to bring joy in this world - we should savor and lean into the things that do bring us pleasure and happiness \n\nAlso, there is literally a millions dollar movie made about how women are never too old to play with Barbie lol \n\nI think your mom is angry that you are recovering from her cruelty, that you are an independent adult who is rejecting her opinion, and that you have the confidence to pursue your mental health and your own small joys\n\nKeep all your dolls \n\nGood luck with your mom", "NTA. I still play around with my dolls and I'm in my 30s. It's fun.", "If we lived near each other I'd even want to play. Look at their clothes and hairstyles, set up their houses.", "As we get older we become more aware of the faults of our parents and the parenting mistakes they made. It's hard to deal with.", "66 years old and my hobby is rescuing Barbies of all sizes and making clothes for them. My family made fun of me for years\u2026. Until they had daughters and granddaughters who loved receiving these dolls. Enjoy your hobby and walk away from toxic people who don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about you. Broke is better than belittled.", "NTA, what's the point of being an adult if you can't do what you want? Within reason, of course. This isn't hurting anyone and it's making you feel better! Also, if your mom tries to throw out your toys now, you can tell her no, because you're an adult, and stealing from adults unfortunately has more consequences than stealing from children.   \nYour mom sucks btw, I hope you can move out soon because she's negatively impacting your mental health! She's the reason you need a therapist in the first place, she has no right to try to tell you how to be mentally healthy herself.", "NTA.\n\nMy mom is in her 60s and collects Dawn Dolls. She redresses them, displays them, poses them, has photo shoots, and sometimes even takes one on her travels and takes pics. One half of the TV cabinet has a dollhouse setup.\n\nPeople play/collect video games, collect comic books or those funko pops, adults do Lego sets, adults with plushies, even adults with American Girl Dolls (especially Barbie\u2019s)", "A psychologist once told me that there are characteristics on each phase that we must overcome and other we shouldn't forget, and that from childhood the capacity of playing, getting fun just because, and finding enjoyment on small things are one of those that shouldn't be forgotten.\n\nNTA. Also there's plenty of adults who collect dolls and other toys, and yes, some play with them, do dioaramas, take photos, make some videos for YouTube, that's also playing in a more sutile way.", "Ok so you are an adult but a little girl at the same time? And why does she even care, if you like \"childish toys\"? What are you supposed to like? A rifle? And its truly so damn disturbing that they threw your toys out and laughed about it. How sick can your mother and her boyfriend even be.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing that needs chucking out in this story is your mother. \n\n(I understand you have to live with her right now for financial reasons. I\u2019m just making the point that she\u2019s the problem, not the Barbies. There\u2019s nothing wrong with an adult having fun with toys.)", "OP, I am 48 and although most toys in our house belong to my 10yr old, I have my own stuffed toys( mostly Disney) and Cabbage patch dolls that I bough my in my 30\u2019s.\n\nYou are normal and fine and your mother is wrong. \nI hope you can move out soon \u2764\ufe0f", "You are a grown ass woman who chooses to play with dolls because she is an adult.

But I probably live a long way away.", "Thank you for being so kind I appreciate you telling me your experience as well. It\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not alone", "Nta.  Role play with dolls etc is useful for many different things.  People with ASD often play out social situations with dolls. They can be used in therapy. \n\nI played with my dolls into early / mid teens due to ASD social issues. My mum gave them away to relatives without asking me, and although I\u2019d moved on, I was still upset. Parents shouldn\u2019t give away their kids possessions without permission.", "Honey,  I still have my barbies in a box in the garage. I was saving them for my children. Well I got a boy and he has NO interest in dolls so we do Lego together. I wish I had kept my childhood Lego but alas sometimes we let things go.\n\nYour mother did not allow you to let them go on your terms and harmed you very deeply. It is reprehensible what she did.  I feel angry for you. \n\nKeep up the therapy. Keep playing. You are fine. I love Lego and video games and sewing and gardening. You can have multiple hobbies of varying levels of \"maturity\". I would hide your dolls somewhere your mother cannot get to them. She WILL  try to dispose of them again. I speculate she had her toys taken like she did to you.  Generational trauma of \"it was done to me so I'll do it to my own children\" is a thing.\n\nWish you well and happy playing with the dolls.", "I didn\u2019t drink or party at your age. I worked full time as a software/database engineer and spent hours playing with the toys my coworkers and I brought into the office. Two decades later and I still play with games and toys. It\u2019s one of the best ways to destress after a long day of inventing/using cutting edge technology (I have a cool job). I\u2019ve done my fair share of classic parting - even did the sorority thing - but it got pretty repetitive in my opinion. By every measure your Mom could imagine, I\u2019m a responsible and successful adult, and yet I have a large collection of classic Barbies and more Barbie accessories/cars/horses/furniture than any 10 kids could need. They even have a (small) room of their own.\n\nYou should feel no embarrassment about this. You\u2019re doing the best thing for your mental health and having fun too! You deserve much better than how your Mom has treated you.", "Man, my step parent went through and got rid of all of my things when I was a grown ass adult paying rent because she isn't sentimental about anything. I'm still traumatized about it because I would have consolidated on my own and feel like it was my job to part with things and relive those memories for a moment before I let them go. I've got serious issues now as I'm pushing middle age when anyone goes through my things and I can't find something important to me because it feels like you're not being allowed control over how your own space is managed. There are reasons to become less attached to material things, like our house burned down when I was 14 and I was pretty well adjusted to letting things go when they were just things, but the irreplaceable stuff still comes up in my memories sometimes", "Put a lock on your door so she can't access your room op. NTA", "If it helps, remember you are no longer a child. You are an adult who can call the police and report stolen or damaged property if your mother takes or harms your possessions in your private room. As the above poster said, these are therapy sanctioned tools for helping with your personal care and mental well-being. Your therapist can also help you and advise you, if your living situation becomes damaging to you, and especially if your mother takes or damages your property. Please give them a call or email or go see them and let them know about this most recent altercation, your mother is pushing the buttons she installed to make you feel weak and powerless but you aren\u2019t. Talk to your therapist and get their advice on how to handle it when things like this happen. It will take time but that anxiety you feel is the button she installed when she destroyed your childhood bedroom, she\u2019s pushing the button to control you and make you bend to her will but you have back up now- you are a grown adult who has a therapist and rights and people to help you. Don\u2019t throw out your toys.", "Then try to put a lock on the bin", "In your culture is being abused ok? Cause that's what your mother and her partner did from when you were 12 . NTA", "This is a hard one. There are times when it is disrespectful to argue with elders. But the sad fact is that some elders can be very disrespectful.

The girls are also expected to grow up quickly and if you don\u2019t follow their rules they will quickly make your new home the street", "NTA lock the bin and in all cultures you should respect the elders on the other hand life has taught me that you have to stop being a doormat as you are only hurting yourself.
