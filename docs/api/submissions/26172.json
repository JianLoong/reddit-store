Have you gone for tests? people don't buy it when you just claim to have it because you have a rather common symptom that can be linked to other things. It's human nature to be skeptical without evidence, and people usually can tell when something is bullshit or not, again human nature and it's kept the human race alive for millions of years. Tell them which one you have, well them what it means and what can happen. tell them the info about it instead of just saying \"sorry, I can't eat that\" Does it make sense, no, not really, but if you want people to take you seriously, go to the doctor and get it on record then. \n\nYou should know what you need to do in order to take care of yourself when it comes to this, you are 25, so you should be a big girl and be able to tell people no, and not just eat something that could do some serious damage to your body. giving them its name instead of just saying you can't eat this or that is going to help a lot more people understand far better than just saying \" I can't eat fruit\" I am honestly having a hard time buying this story because anyone with any form of allergy or intolerance would NEVER just eat something to prove a point.
