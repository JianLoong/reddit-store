My wife had a twin sister who had unfortunately passed from child birth, however Mike (47M) who was 30 at the time really stepped up for the first three years of Sarah\u2019s (17F) life. Sarah\u2019s paternal and maternal grandparents and my wife also were stepping up to help out Mike. I helped out occasionally but not as much as my wife  because i didn\u2019t want to overstep. when Sarah was 1 my wife got pregnant and we started focusing on our baby. \nEverything went smoothly for Mike, until Tracey (42F) 25 at the time, came into the picture. Tracey was an ok step mother but really didn\u2019t care. But i guess one day Tracey gave Mike an ultimatum between her and Sarah, Mike immediately drove Sarah to her maternal grandparents house, told her to \u201csit and wait for grandma and grandpa,\u201d and then left. After a week it was decided that me and my wife would take care of her and my son got an older sister. \nSarah was like a daughter to me and my wife, and called us mom and dad. We did not need to legally adopt her because Mike didn\u2019t want her and still to this day could not give a crap about Sarah. \nher bio paternal grandparents reached out to us asking to be in Sarah\u2019s life which we agreed. Sarah has always known of Mike but never reached out. \nA week ago Sarah sat us down and asked us to legally adopt her. that was a no. we can\u2019t afford the adoption process or let alone lawyers. yesterday during dinner she left the house to go spend the night at her grandmother\u2019s. we had explained to her that she doesn\u2019t need any fancy papers to be our daughter and we love her as one. \nShe may not be our blood daughter but shes just as important to us as our son, if that wasn\u2019t the case, i wouldn\u2019t have taught her italian and my family wouldn\u2019t have taught her their traditions. ever since she stormed off my in-laws and sarah\u2019s paternal aunt and grandparents agree with me but don\u2019t want to start drama with sarah, my mother is willing to pay for the adoption but I know they\u2019re saving money so my terminally ill dad can pass in italy and me, my wife, kids, and mom can go to the funeral there. AITA\n\nEDIT: the legal fees of adoption where me and my wife are is generally around $15,000k-25,000k. We had gotten her last name legally changed, her last name is [My last name]-[SILs last name]. Mike and my SIL were engaged at the time of the birth. my sil did not want to share a last name with her husband because of her independence, and they agreed to have it her sils last name since she bore the child. We had gotten it changed to that when she was 13 because we couldn\u2019t afford adoption and she agreed to have it changed. My wife wanted to hyphenated because my wife didn\u2019t want to erase her sister from her daughter, and Sarah agreed to have it changed that way because although she has never met her mom, my wife makes sure Sarah knows what a wonderful woman she was. Also mike does pay child support, he only pays $250 a month. He is not legally inclined to, but Mikes parents told him if he doesn\u2019t pay he will not get their will. he sends the money to them, and they send it to us.", "created_utc": 1687898010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14konn3/aita_for_not_adopting_my_daughter/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wait until after your grandfather\u2019s funeral to ask for financial help from relatives.   \n  \nMeanwhile, head over to the r/legaladvice subreddit and see if you can\u2019t get an idea of how much it would actually cost and how much you can do without a lawyer or with minimal lawyer assistance (I\u2019m guessing between her age and the fact that her dad doesn\u2019t care and would probably very easily terminate parental rights, you wouldn\u2019t need a lot).", "No one is the asshole here - maybe just say yes when we get the money.", "NAH I guess\u2026except for breaking her heart.

Yeah the emotional ties are there but legally she isn\u2019t \u201cyour daughter\u201d and hearing her background - that matters to her and I can see why. \n\nMy aunt in law legally adopted her granddaughter when she was a baby and the cost was significantly lower than what you are quoting. It was basically paying an attorney to draw up the adoption paperwork, mom and das had already given up legal custody (drug issues), and filing in the courts.  Obviously country and state specific, but costs are usually much much lower when dealing with your specific situation.", "For a 17 year old those are not just papers for her that's a way to fully become family in a legal way now for her it just seems like in the end you don't want her as your child fully of course she it hurt \nI don't want to call you an ahole but i still think your in the wrong even if money is the problem", "NTA - her mother was your wife\u2019s sister.

If the child is considered special needs you may qualify for the full amount even if you did not incur that much in expenses.\n\nSo if you were going to owe $18,000 in federal taxes for the year this tax credit could lower that to $18,000 - $14,890 = $3,110.

She may not get it now, but when she's adult enough to understand exactly how much money that is, and that sometimes, the money just doesn't exist even when you want and need it to, she'll be more understanding.", "I also wonder if there can't be another way of doing the adoption that's cheaper.  It looks like in a lot of places, adopting a foster child with you is free so maybe OP could get declared Sarah's foster parent, and then adopt?  Or maybe try to set up a consultation with a lawyer (often free) to see what the price would really be in their case?  I think if OP showed they were actively trying to figure something out that it would mean a lot to Sarah.", "Maybe it does in America OP isn\u2019t American.", "This is the correct solution and I\u2019m not sure why OP didn\u2019t consider it instead of completely dismissing Sarah. There is a lot less red tape when she turns 18 and wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near that expensive. It sounds like this is really important to Sarah and it is a whole lot more than a piece of paper in her mind. It\u2019s a sense of stability and protection after already facing abandonment once in her life.", "You can technically do it with no lawyers if everyone consents to it, or the parents have passed. My husband adopted my son, and the courts sent me copies of the paperwork to fill out/reword to reflect the correct parties. We mostly spent money on background checks, court filings, and notarizing forms. For me it was the county surrogacy office that was in charge of that. \n\n\nMaybe I got stupid lucky, but it doesn't hurt to just call the court house and ask?", "Adopting a foster child isn't free. It costs the state about $10,000 or so, last time I checked. It's just that the taxpayers cover it. You can't just have a child declared a foster child either. \n\nHowever, OP should not be paying 5 figures for an adoption of this type. There's no reason for it to cost $15K+.", "My cousin was named legal guardian of her niece and is now her adoptive mother. It took a few years, but she didn\u2019t have to pay anything out of her own pockets (in the United States). It might be worth looking into.", "where do you live", "Is that to go through an adoption agency or to adopt a family member because that's usually not as high. Can we get your country? Not like your city or anything but it would help if we knew your country.", "Sure, if them saving 20K is actually feasible, but it doesn't sound like it is.  If it's not something that's actually going to happen, then the jar is just a lie.", "Can you adopt an adult?", "I've never heard of an adoption like this one costing as much as OP says.", "Yes, let's have OP pull 20K out of his ass.", "> Assuming you're in the US\n\nOP isn't in the US.", "He\u2019s clearly Italian so he\u2019s European but he doesn\u2019t live in Italy.Could be living in France,Germany,The Netherlands or Poland maybe If I was to guess.", "Its not a lie, it's the tangible representation of a hope and a promise", "Yes, you can.", "That's going to entirely depend on OP's locale.", "... a promise that wont ever be fulfilled.", "Yeah so you should scrape up the money to pay a lawyer for a life planning session. Because there's a giant difference between emergency contact and next of kin/medical power."]}
