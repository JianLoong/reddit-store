My wife had a twin sister who had unfortunately passed from child birth, however Mike (47M) who was 30 at the time really stepped up for the first three years of Sarah\u2019s (17F) life. Sarah\u2019s paternal and maternal grandparents and my wife also were stepping up to help out Mike. I helped out occasionally but not as much as my wife  because i didn\u2019t want to overstep. when Sarah was 1 my wife got pregnant and we started focusing on our baby. \nEverything went smoothly for Mike, until Tracey (42F) 25 at the time, came into the picture. Tracey was an ok step mother but really didn\u2019t care. But i guess one day Tracey gave Mike an ultimatum between her and Sarah, Mike immediately drove Sarah to her maternal grandparents house, told her to \u201csit and wait for grandma and grandpa,\u201d and then left. After a week it was decided that me and my wife would take care of her and my son got an older sister. \nSarah was like a daughter to me and my wife, and called us mom and dad. We did not need to legally adopt her because Mike didn\u2019t want her and still to this day could not give a crap about Sarah. \nher bio paternal grandparents reached out to us asking to be in Sarah\u2019s life which we agreed. Sarah has always known of Mike but never reached out. \nA week ago Sarah sat us down and asked us to legally adopt her. that was a no. we can\u2019t afford the adoption process or let alone lawyers. yesterday during dinner she left the house to go spend the night at her grandmother\u2019s. we had explained to her that she doesn\u2019t need any fancy papers to be our daughter and we love her as one. \nShe may not be our blood daughter but shes just as important to us as our son, if that wasn\u2019t the case, i wouldn\u2019t have taught her italian and my family wouldn\u2019t have taught her their traditions. ever since she stormed off my in-laws and sarah\u2019s paternal aunt and grandparents agree with me but don\u2019t want to start drama with sarah, my mother is willing to pay for the adoption but I know they\u2019re saving money so my terminally ill dad can pass in italy and me, my wife, kids, and mom can go to the funeral there. AITA\n\nEDIT: the legal fees of adoption where me and my wife are is generally around $15,000k-25,000k. We had gotten her last name legally changed, her last name is [My last name]-[SILs last name]. Mike and my SIL were engaged at the time of the birth. my sil did not want to share a last name with her husband because of her independence, and they agreed to have it her sils last name since she bore the child. We had gotten it changed to that when she was 13 because we couldn\u2019t afford adoption and she agreed to have it changed. My wife wanted to hyphenated because my wife didn\u2019t want to erase her sister from her daughter, and Sarah agreed to have it changed that way because although she has never met her mom, my wife makes sure Sarah knows what a wonderful woman she was. Also mike does pay child support, he only pays $250 a month. He is not legally inclined to, but Mikes parents told him if he doesn\u2019t pay he will not get their will. he sends the money to them, and they send it to us.\n\nEdit #2: I didn\u2019t clarify in the post because it was more of a summary than a detail of events. We were not hard with Sarah about her wanting us to adopt her. We softly told her that love her so much and to us she is our child and we love her just as much as we do our son. This is a delicate situation and anyone with a brain cell would know to handle it softly. I put it in the post softly because i\u2019m direct most of the time, but with my daughter, my wife and I handled it pretty gently.", "created_utc": 1687898010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14konn3/aita_for_not_adopting_my_daughter/", "score": 393, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hopefully she\u2019ll understand", "NAH\n\nIf you don't have $15-25k, you just don't have it. \n\nIt also seems really misguided to spend that much when university fees and getting her started in life are looming.\n\nI understand why she is upset and considering this a rejection, but I'd continue to emphasize that you think of her as your real child, but you literally do not have the money to make this happen for her. She may not get it now, but when she's adult enough to understand exactly how much money that is, and that sometimes, the money just doesn't exist even when you want and need it to, she'll be more understanding.", "I also wonder if there can't be another way of doing the adoption that's cheaper.  It looks like in a lot of places, adopting a foster child with you is free so maybe OP could get declared Sarah's foster parent, and then adopt?  Or maybe try to set up a consultation with a lawyer (often free) to see what the price would really be in their case?  I think if OP showed they were actively trying to figure something out that it would mean a lot to Sarah.", "Maybe it does in America OP isn\u2019t American.", "This is the correct solution and I\u2019m not sure why OP didn\u2019t consider it instead of completely dismissing Sarah. There is a lot less red tape when she turns 18 and wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near that expensive. It sounds like this is really important to Sarah and it is a whole lot more than a piece of paper in her mind. It\u2019s a sense of stability and protection after already facing abandonment once in her life.", "You can technically do it with no lawyers if everyone consents to it, or the parents have passed. My husband adopted my son, and the courts sent me copies of the paperwork to fill out/reword to reflect the correct parties. We mostly spent money on background checks, court filings, and notarizing forms. For me it was the county surrogacy office that was in charge of that. \n\n\nMaybe I got stupid lucky, but it doesn't hurt to just call the court house and ask?", "Adopting a foster child isn't free. It costs the state about $10,000 or so, last time I checked. It's just that the taxpayers cover it.

Because there's a giant difference between emergency contact and next of kin/medical power.", "What country do you live in?\nI call BS on those adoption fees.

Best of luck to you all!", "Is adult adoption a possibility where you live? NAH", "NAH. She's going to be 18 soon so spending all that money doesn't make sense. \n\nHere's what you do - hold a non-legal adoption ceremony/party and have some kind of document/certificate drawn up so that she can have something tangible to look back on. I'm not sure she really cares about the legality of it but maybe she just wants a way to know that she will still be your child once you're no longer legally responsible for her.\n\nYou sound like great parents and where you're coming from makes total sense but, as an adoptee myself I also can understand how she may be feeling. \n\nTalk to her, ask her what aspect of the adoption is important to her and then work together to find a compromise that makes her feel safe and doesn't cost you thousands of dollars.", "This is hard. But also when I looked online for adoptions of relatives, no agencies need to involved. You just need to have a lawyer to file etc. Would it be possible to see a lawyer and enquire about the current process and fees that would be associated? \n\nIf you contact a law firm, they will probably be able to send through a list of fees without even having a meeting or charging you. \n\nIf the Paternal grandparents have that much money that it made Mike send a measly amount of monthly child support, would they be willing to help out with the adoption fees?

The cost they're talking about is for a PRIVATE adoption.

He'll also be the one dictating all care or after life decisions should they be needed - she'll have no say. \n\nI know it's a lot of money for adoption, but it's not just a matter of love and belonging - there are very real ramifications to consider.", "Given that you believe that adoption costs a sum you cannot afford, what you did is logical.
