His mother and I are divorced, but have attempted to put aside our differences to co-parent amicably for his sake. Still, it's no secret for anyone who has done it that co-parenting is HARD. One of the main reasons she and I split up is because of her lack of enthusiasm or interest in our son's life, and that has just gotten worse since she had to start working full-time following our divorce.\n\nI have since remarried and had another child. Thanks to the level of income my husband brings in, we're comfortable and I'm able to stay home with my boys. Our custody agreement, because I'm able to stay home and my ex not having that same privilege, means she only gets him every other weekend. We did some early gift opening and treats at our home before he left, but his actual birthday happened to fall on one such weekend.\n\nMy son is a very shy little boy. The list of people he actually enjoys spending time with, particularly ones his own age, is a small one. On this list would likely just be two close school friends and his little brother. He gets easily overstimulated and while we've learned to manage that at school with talks with his teachers and lots of in-class structure, it can still be a problem if we go out somewhere with lots of children with little supervision. For example, Chuck E. Cheese has always been a no for us. An ideal birthday for him would be running around in mine and my husband's back yard playing with the kids mentioned on that list, plus getting some presents and extra attention from dads + grandparents.\n\nI'm sure you can imagine my surprise when my ex told me that the birthday she had planned involved inviting every student from his class to an arcade. My other son wasn't on the guest list for this party, and neither were myself, my husband, or either of our parents. I was obviously upset by this because I knew this was not going to go well for my son. And what do you know, half-way through the party, my ex had to call me because he was crying for me and wouldn't calm down.\n\nAfter I calmed him down upon picking him up, I had my husband take him outside for some fresh air. I then apologized to the other parents for the abrupt end to the party - and noticed some of my ex's friends who don't have children there, which I found bizarre. I asked my ex to talk with me privately and she refused, so I openly told her that she needed to get her shit together as soon as possible and that even having a very basic level of knowledge about our son could have prevented this.\n\nSince then, I have received multiple texts calling me rude and saying I embarrassed her in front of her the other parents.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667932783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypup9o/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sons_mom_in_front_of_the/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said no.   She gets told how wrong her actions were in front of everyone.", "Here's the thing. I'd be more inclined to call you an AH if you just showed up and chewed into her, but the fact that she asked to you to come to clean up this mess and the emotional reaction of seeing your child in distress, yeah you were actually more reasonable that I might have been.

You asked for a private conversation and she said No.  She humiliated herself.", "NTA well done on supporting your son, can you amend the custody agreement so he stays with you more?", "Nta", "YTA. Yes, you purposely shamed her in front of the other parents. Yes, you demonstrated publicly for all to see that you are the superior parent. Yes, you further corroded any working relationship for co-parenting.

But even if it had been his own, we're his parents and can decide what's best for him. There will be times in the future when we'll try out places like arcades again to see if he can handle it, but that will be in a situation where we can easily get out if need be. Hosting a party there means there is expectation to stay a certain amount of time and entertain guests. That just puts unnecessary pressure on the situation. It makes me sad that this is just another bad memory for him in a place that's supposed to be fun, especially when it could have been avoided.\n\nI find it bizarre because while his little brother, dads, and other family members weren't invited, adults who he hardly interacts with were.\n\nI could have waited to talk to her in private, but I was incredibly frustrated.

I've known people with divorced parents or are divorced parents who have had separate birthdays and people who had joint birthdays. Meaning some families do it together and some don't. That's something you and your ex need to discuss.\n\nMy issue with addressing her at the party is that it's not great do your son. Let your parenting discussion happen in private. I think your ex messed up a little with a party he wasn't ready for. And there's a version of this mistake that truly has no ill intent. It was still the wrong thing to do but it's not as though she was trying to hurt your son.

She was more involved when our son was an infant, but once he got to the toddler stage she had checked out a lot. In my opinion, that's when the reality set in for her that she was going to have to be a parent for an entire 18 years (and beyond, of course - parenthood doesn't just stop there) and she started missing the life we lived prior to having a baby.", "Why? If OP had married another woman would you still be querying this?

There's a lot of assumptions in your previous comment. \n\nOp actions prove he's a great parent and I would say the same thing even if he was a woman. And if his ex was a man, I'd still think the ex was being a shit parent.", "She called OP. She did not call his husband. OP stated \u201cwe\u201d are his parents in reference to himself and his husband. That is just not true.", "I'm sure you can understand how IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW he was bi/pan, that just adds even more to this situation for someone to process? Like if he left her for a woman half her age, that makes a bad situation even worse for the dumped woman, because now she got dumped AND she's feeling old?", "You don't know exactly what upset the kid. Neither does OP. Both of you are assuming it was the crowd - but it could have been the food, that his party was a bunch of adults, that the cake was the wrong flavor, that mom wouldn't give him more money to play games, etc. \n\nAnd dumping your dirty laundry on the ex in front of her friends does NOT promote amicable co-parenting.", "Yeah maybe he meant all three of them when he said \u201cwe as parents\u201d but it could also mean just him and her. I didn\u2019t pick up on that from what OP wrote. Also the child lives with the dads a majority of the time. Step parents are still parents even if they don\u2019t have equal say in parenting decisions."]}
