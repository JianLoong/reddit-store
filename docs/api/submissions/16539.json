{"id": 16539, "submission_id": "139rhv9", "title": "AITA for not wanting to make my boyfriend\u2019s guest dinner?", "selftext": "So this morning my boyfriend (31M) went to do a weekly activity. He's usually gone for three hours max. I noticed he was out longer than usual and got worried because he's always back within that time frame. I tried to contact him but his phone was strangely off. That's when I got even more worried.\n\nHe finally messages me back that he's on his way back. I immediately call him asking what's going on and why his phone was off. He informs me that he decided to stay out a bit longer with his friend (30M), he lost phone service where he was at and that he's bringing his friend back to the house. At this point I'm annoyed because it's not really making sense to me and I get even more annoyed because I don't really like his friend.\n\nHe's informed me that his friend has made some disrespectful comments about me in the past. His friend has joked that I look easy and that he thinks he could've bagged me himself. Ew. Regardless of these comments, l've always been polite when he comes around.\n\nWhile he was on his way back, my boyfriend asked if I could make him a plate of dinner. I was initially going to refuse because of his lack of communication and the situation that had happened, but I decided I wasn't going to be petty and made him the plate anyway.\n\nHe comes back and we don't really have time to talk because he needs to go host his friend. As I go and give him his plate, he hands it straight to his friend and I'm confused. His friend and I are both surprised and his friend asks \"Is this for me?\" and my boyfriend tells him yes. His friend then looks at me and says \"Thank you\". I'm completely confused and annoyed but put a smile on my face and say \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d anyway.\n\nAs my boyfriend goes into the kitchen alone to heat up his leftovers from yesterday, I follow him and ask him why he made me make dinner for his friend, knowing I don't like him. He brushes me off and says that l'm being really rude and that his friend is a guest.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: So the friend left a while ago and as soon as he did my boyfriend asked if we could have a conversation. He immediately apologised for not letting me know he would be out later than usual and understood why I would be worried as it was out of his usual routine, paired with his phone being off. \n\nIn regards to his friends comments, he apologised again for being inconsiderate and explained that he understood why I would be uncomfortable with the friend. He then expanded on them and said the comments had been made early on in our relationship, right after we had all met each other (I met him and his friend at a mutual friends party a year ago) and since we\u2019ve been dating and officially been together, his friend has since apologised and taken back his comments and actually compliments my character and our relationship. Not that this justifies the initial comments, however I was unaware of this and my boyfriends friend also doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m aware of the comments he made before. \n\nHe suggested to organise a meeting so the friend could apologise for his comments, but I think that would make everyone uncomfortable, especially as the friend doesn\u2019t even know that I know about the comments. I just said that I will work on moving past the friends comments and that when he comes over my boyfriend will be responsible for hosting him completely until I\u2019m comfortable doing so again.", "created_utc": 1683383523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139rhv9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_boyfriends_guest/", "score": 680, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, ok they don\u2019t want to restart anything by talking to me directly I guess but it\u2019s not the same as getting a proper apology.\n\nIt\u2019s great that he has accepted the apology and moved past it, but you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t feel that way. NTA.", "So it\u2019s fine for this guy to make shitty comments about a woman who doesn\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d to someone he knows but he\u2019s apologetic once the BF claims her. Sure. And tricking you into cooking was crappy. He\u2019s the AH.", "Ugh. NTA.", "[removed]", "I have to agree. Why would you tell your girlfriend that? My SIL initially told my husband not to marry me and he told me. Took decades to repair that damage.", "Yes. He got a whiff of her righteous indignation and is throwing excuse bombs to slow her down. \nI don\u2019t believe a millimeter of his apologies or explanations.", "Me too...", "It sounds like her another way to keep her in her place /sarc", "I'm not sure I agree. The boyfriend was not present in the home to cook. That's why he asked the OP to cook in the first place, while he was in transit.\n\nBut if he was able to cook, then obviously he had the ability to host a guest without any trouble.", "He asked her to cook for him. He didn\u2019t ask her to host. He should have come home and cooked for his own trashy guest.", "NTA but he's a complete jerk. He disappears, brings TA home with him and expects you to cook dinner for TA? \n\nHe had no business disappearing, bringing TA to the house or expecting you to cook dinner.\n\nI don't care what he has to say, he's out of line. Nor am I inclined to believe TA changed his tune; if that's true, why didn't he say?\n\nBoth bf and his friend are TA", "NTA \n\nYour boyfriend lied to you", "NTA but it seems like your boyfriend very skillfully redirected you out if being upset about being tricked and disrespected. He forced you into doing something out-of-your-way nice for this friend and the friend 100% took it that way. That would bother me, and i imagine it bothers you. Dont let it go, and look at your relationship and really think deeply if it is a pattern for him to talk away issues and shift focus.", "NTA, and I don't accept his \"lost phone service\" for a minute.\n\nFurthermore, his continued relationship with someone who disrespected you id it's own whole problem.", "NTA - But your boyfriend sounds like an AH", "Do you refuse to do things for your partner when you're mad at each other? If so, you probably should be working on yourself a little.\n\nThat would be petty and immature.", "Bot.

That's why my vote was ESH.\n\nI also believe the OP's girlfriend was extremely rude to have expressed her complaint while the friend was present in the home. If the OP's girlfriend did not want to host him and believes she had no obligation to grant this minimal politeness not to argue about how much courtesy to give a guest while they are there, then I think serious reconsideration should be given to whether the OP and his girlfriend should be living in the same home.", "OP, this should read \"Ex-boyfriend.\" Not once have I read him treating you with any respect.\n\nNTA.", "Did he really lose service? Really? Doesn't happen that often does it.", "Girl how much to you want to bet that if you go to the exact location your BF claims he was that you will have service?

But consider inspecting your boyfriends life a bit more. It seems like he\u2019s being sneaky and apologizes to let your guard down", "So I'm confused what you want out of this, you sound unnecessarily difficult.\n\nThere were some legitimate things that happened that you had a right to be upset about. It sounds like all of those were apologized for.\n\nBut that hasn't satisfied you.  What are you looking for at this point?", "I don't believe anything your bf said... YTA if you believe him.", "I call bull on the friend apologizing spontaneously to bf by himself. Someone who calls a girl \"easy\" to her face isn't the sort of person who tends to look at their decisions very much.\n\nJust be on a lookout, OP, bf tricked you to make food for friend and he might try to trick you to accept him next.", "NTA Nothing in your edit puts your AH BF in any better light for what he did regarding the plate you fixed. That is an asshole pure and simple. Not a fan of making guys sleep on the couch, but in this case I most certainly would, or I'd go get a hotel myself. Probably before I came home to pack, but that would be based on how well he understood it was his own damn fault and didn't shift blame the next morning.", "Right? Like I\u2019m still stuck on why he\u2019d give his plate to his friend and then warm up leftovers for himself.", "Finally! You hit the nail on the head. You\u2019re right, he SHOULD leave her and move out so she can find a better man.", "YTA for subjecting yourself to such a crappy relationship.  I noticed you didn't mention your age.... is there perhaps a significant age gap?", "The thing is, nothing can be undone once said. You are not required to accept any apology or be put into a situation where you feel coerced into it. \nThe true test of things is if the friend remains different and doesn\u2019t do it again.\nYou are NTA but holy wow, your boyfriend is manipulative.", "I wonder what strip club or other place they were at where his phone could not magically work?", "The lying and making her have food ready for the guest she absolutely didn\u2019t want is fucking wild to me. \n\nIt made me feel like her partner is a total fucking creep.", "I'm also confused why he has to share those comments with his girlfriend (if it is very early in the relationship), or why they're friends at all. If my friends (male or female) objectify a person, I'd be wtfed.", "I don't get it, especially as it doesn't seem like he gave any sort of explanation for that or an apology. He apologized for bringing the guy over, but the food thing is so weird.  It's like he decided to force OP into a position of subservience for this creep who'd previously said she looked easy and like he could get her into bed if he wanted.  It's weird, creepy, and I don't like it.", "Yeah, the BF is going into way too much detail with his explanation.  Methinks he was doing something else...", "Are you his girlfriend or his maid? He stays out for hours and then wants you to cook and doesn\u2019t mention that it\u2019s not for him. He was up to something and apparently owes his friend a favor and you should do yourself a favor and dump his sorry ass!", "YES. It was simply demeaning and fucked up", "NTA and your bf is a lil biatch for letting his friend talk about you like that.", "You know your edit does not make anything about this better, right?", "This sub kills me.  A couple communicates and works through their problems, what adults are supposed to do, and people still come for the male with torches and pitchforks.  I sincerely hope these are all teenagers pretending to be adults.  I'm out.", "Err, where was the apology for tricking you into making dinner for his friend? NTA", "It seems to me like the friend has gross attitudes towards women, but since you've been claimed by your boyfriend the friend will now be respectful to you. \n\nWhat does it even mean, that a woman \"looks easy\"? Is he the kind of man who thinks women don't enjoy sex, and if  a woman has sex with a man that she has somehow \"lost\" something? Is that what he meant by saying he could have \"bagged\" you? Like, he could have tricked you into having sex with him but then dumped you and then laughed about it with his friends?\n\nThe friend is gross and immature, I wouldn't want to be around him.", "NTA\n\nBut may I suggest that maybe you all find a way to move on from the past? If you don't you will only build up resentment towards your BF and vice versa. People can be shitty and say shitty things but they can change but it's totally up to you what to do since you are the victim here. If you don't though your relationship may not last too much longer because this guy and your BF are close and guys build strong friendships.", "Also who phones someone and asks to be made dinner? They\u2019re just out of their 20s.", "It wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing for him to read this post. He was deliberately deceptive.", "Hi, just saying, NTA obviously, but re: your edit?  There is fucking zero chance that his friend has even THOUGHT about apologizing for those comments.  This screams \"oh fuck she's really mad uh shit shit shit, well, better say SOMETHING.\"  The \"set up a meeting\" would be him telling his friend that he has to say this or you'll be pissed off at BF.  If his friend had actually apologized, he would have TOLD you, because he KNOWS YOU DON'T LIKE HIM.\n\n\"Oh, uh, honey, I know he said you were easy before but... um... now he said you're NOT easy!  Didn't I mention that?\"", "NTA. After reading your edits, your bf is playing you. This isn\u2019t a \u2018friend\u2019 problem.

He didn\u2019t get in touch because he knew you would wouldn\u2019t like his friend coming back with him. He figured it was easier to apologise to you than tell his friend no.\n\u2022He tricked you into making his friend food. He knew you would say no if he asked and didn\u2019t want to make the food himself for whatever reason so, again, it was easier to apologise to you after the fact than do it himself or ask you honestly.\n\nYour bf lied to you, tricked you and brought someone he knew you dislike into your house without your permission. If you really want to be with someone who will disrespect you so easily, please at least tell him that this experience is a verbal warning and he\u2019s now on thin ice.", "Your boyfriend would rather put you out than his friend. If you are living together then 31 is way too old to be worried about this sort of nonsense. Top to bottom this sounds like he was being entirely inconsiderate of your feelings.\n\nI mean, it's f he is going somewhere he could lose service or staying out later, both of thee situations warrant a text at minimum. And then assuming you would just feed his friend too? \n\nIdk girl, he owes you a lot of apologies here IMO. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.....\nRed flags abound...... something smells fishy", "NTA. But I would recommend getting out of the habit of just smiling and being polite to people who are disrespectful to you, or not wanting to let the friend know that you know or make him uncomfortable. Time to stand up for yourself sometimes.", "Did the friend actually make these remarks? This guy sucks. NTA, he's manipulating you into not wanting to hang out with his friends. I bet if you ask the friend it will be a different story. Or if he did he's shown you what type of people he's aligning with and thus who he is.", "Good point - I didn\u2019t think of that. Makes sense though, because it\u2019s telling that bf only told OP that the friend had apologised and made nice comments when bf realised that OP was mad at him for bringing the guy to their home.", "Or someone else"]}
