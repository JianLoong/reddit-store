{"id": 16539, "submission_id": "139rhv9", "title": "AITA for not wanting to make my boyfriend\u2019s guest dinner?", "selftext": "So this morning my boyfriend (31M) went to do a weekly activity. He's usually gone for three hours max. I noticed he was out longer than usual and got worried because he's always back within that time frame. I tried to contact him but his phone was strangely off. That's when I got even more worried.\n\nHe finally messages me back that he's on his way back. I immediately call him asking what's going on and why his phone was off. He informs me that he decided to stay out a bit longer with his friend (30M), he lost phone service where he was at and that he's bringing his friend back to the house. At this point I'm annoyed because it's not really making sense to me and I get even more annoyed because I don't really like his friend.\n\nHe's informed me that his friend has made some disrespectful comments about me in the past. His friend has joked that I look easy and that he thinks he could've bagged me himself. Ew. Regardless of these comments, l've always been polite when he comes around.\n\nWhile he was on his way back, my boyfriend asked if I could make him a plate of dinner. I was initially going to refuse because of his lack of communication and the situation that had happened, but I decided I wasn't going to be petty and made him the plate anyway.\n\nHe comes back and we don't really have time to talk because he needs to go host his friend. As I go and give him his plate, he hands it straight to his friend and I'm confused. His friend and I are both surprised and his friend asks \"Is this for me?\" and my boyfriend tells him yes. His friend then looks at me and says \"Thank you\". I'm completely confused and annoyed but put a smile on my face and say \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d anyway.\n\nAs my boyfriend goes into the kitchen alone to heat up his leftovers from yesterday, I follow him and ask him why he made me make dinner for his friend, knowing I don't like him. He brushes me off and says that l'm being really rude and that his friend is a guest.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: So the friend left a while ago and as soon as he did my boyfriend asked if we could have a conversation. He immediately apologised for not letting me know he would be out later than usual and understood why I would be worried as it was out of his usual routine, paired with his phone being off. \n\nIn regards to his friends comments, he apologised again for being inconsiderate and explained that he understood why I would be uncomfortable with the friend. He then expanded on them and said the comments had been made early on in our relationship, right after we had all met each other (I met him and his friend at a mutual friends party a year ago) and since we\u2019ve been dating and officially been together, his friend has since apologised and taken back his comments and actually compliments my character and our relationship. Not that this justifies the initial comments, however I was unaware of this and my boyfriends friend also doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m aware of the comments he made before. \n\nHe suggested to organise a meeting so the friend could apologise for his comments, but I think that would make everyone uncomfortable, especially as the friend doesn\u2019t even know that I know about the comments. I just said that I will work on moving past the friends comments and that when he comes over my boyfriend will be responsible for hosting him completely until I\u2019m comfortable doing so again.", "created_utc": 1683383523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139rhv9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_boyfriends_guest/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When someone shows up unannounced in your home around dinnertime, there is a not uncommon etiquette obligation to offer them the best part of the meal.

Especially someone you already don't like. Although, that's all.\n\nI **do** believe it was inappropriate for your boyfriend not to tell you the food was for his friend, although I suppose I understand his position. He couldn't reasonably ask you to make two dinners. But to be candid I don't think it would have been reasonable for him to ask you to provide his friend a meal you had not already made. Simply put, he was not able to appropriately host his friend, and he should not have brought him over.", "YTA  and your attempt to not be petty failed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
