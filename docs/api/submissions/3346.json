Male Ego?* I'm curious what you think that word means when you're describing a dude who is *the* if not *one of the* **victim's** of OP's mothers actions and schemes.

Just because some men do does not change that fact, because that is and will always be an entirely personal choice contingent on the man's comfort in this scenario.

His brother is being practically trained to weaponize his feelings as a spearhead to get at his brother and his brother's father. He wants to be included, but only as a means to gain access to OP's dad, and from the description he spends more time trying to connect and bond with a man who has already made it clear he isn't playing that role than he does interacting with OP and his friends. He's modeling terrible behaviour from his mother.\n\n It would be better if the mother woke up, realized how toxic and selfish she is, and redirected towards helping her youngest in other ways(especially because she clearly has no shortage of extended family willing to volunteer the time and emotional obligations of other people), but she's not going to do that because she's typical for an individual who has cheated in the past.
