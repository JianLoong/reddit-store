He tries to talk your dad into it but he doesnt get why he is reluctant, or why you go have time alone with him when he believes you are both his children.\n\nWhatever the reality of the situation, thats real for him. He must feel like all of this is because of him, who he is, personally and probably feels like theres something wrong with him.\n\nYour mother is clearly using YOU as a conduit to your dad.

I just totally see how this is going to cause your brother attachment issues as he gets older and will only repeat the cycle for him.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not your fault at all, but I would encourage sympathy with your brother because he's going through a lot.  Also, highly recommend therapy, the way your mom seems he might need it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWish y'all well <3", "That\u2019s so sad for the 13 year old boy. He must just hurt inside . Your mother is  TAH", "It\u2019s not your brothers fault that your mum cheated on your dad so stop treating him like it is because that ain\u2019t fair on him he is still your brother", "NTA. Your mom is, though. Her actions have caused, and will continue to cause, your brother serious hurt.", "NTA. Your mom created this mess.", "NTA\n\nClearly your mother should've picked a more reliable person to cheat with (sarcasm).\n\nYour half brother is not your fathers progeny.  He has no responsibility to him and your mother, her family and your brother (by what is being told to him) are doing their best to manipulate the situation.  He doesn't want to adopt him.  There's a reason your father divorced your mother.  It would be very different if they were still together.\n\nYes it sucks for your brother.  He's got a deadbeat for a dad.\n\nI don't know whether your brother will listen to you if you have a sit down chat with him and try and put it into words that he actually understands.  His mother cheated on the man she was married to which was a deal breaker for him and got pregnant so they are no longer together.  There is no expectation on the ex husband to support the child of an affair that he had nothing to do with in the creation of that child.\n\nYou may need to consider living full time with your dad.  Your brother may be brain washed by your mother if you do this and may not want anything to do with you.", "NTA your mom is wrong for trying to force this. She cheated, your dad has no responsibility for the results of something she did that hurt him deeply.", "Maybe it's time to consider full custody with dad", "This. Also, you need to sit down and talk with your brother. Idk if he can understand at 13, but your relationship is at the point it needs it.\n\nYou could be nicer about your mom than you should be. You can explain that because his dad is not there (explain it in the way he has been told, don't say his dad fled the country to avoid child support if he doesn't know it'll only hurt him and cause more drama) your mom.felt bad and wanted him to have a father figure (honestly, can only hope this is where it came from with your mom she just went about it toxically wrong) She knew that your dad was a good dad, despite the issues between him and her. That her intentions to have the two of them bond were good, but she went about it in a way that's not good for anyone. Due to no fault of his own (your brother) your dad is not comfortable being in that role for him (if he asks why he needs to talk to your mom about that). That when he tries to pressure your dad into being his dad, the way your mom has told him to, he is accidently hurting everyone. How would he feel if he had a young kid constantly following him and hanging on him and telling him he's his brother etc when he isn't and doesn't feel comfortable with it? Then ask if the same kid just hung out like a friend and didn't constantly follow you around and try to get your attention wouldn't that be better? (Or something that draws similarities to what he is doing to something he could or has experienced). Explain to him that he it would be ok if he came along SOMETIMES but he needs to back off and understands that he probably will never be able to have that relationship with your dad like that. Tell him you're sorry for how it makes him feel (because I'm sure you are, your post seems like you understand the hurt in his heart. But that is your mom's doing) but if he relaxes it may (and stress may because he's desperate and going to have a hard time hearing it's a slim possibility) be able to have a bit of a better relationship with everyone. Be on his side that it wasn't fair for your mom to set up his expectations like that and you don't want to hurt him, but he is old enough to hear the truth. You didn't want to wait to talk to him bc the way things are going is only hurting relationships all around including yours and his and you don't want that. If you're willing to go talk to your mom with him (it could be to support him it could be to call her out if she tries to turn the tables) say it. The best thing you can do for your brother, is to be as honest as you can with him but not to let this behavior continue....from anyone.\n\nOn the other hand, your dad sounds great. He is trying to be there for you by trying his best to be there for your brother. That's an incredibly great and strong person and I hope you have told him howuch you appreciate the gesture and effort to be the best dad possible. \n\nOh yeah if it wasn't clear....NTA bur your mom is (your brother isn't either, he's a victim to your mom as much as you and your dad)", "Which is not your's or your father's problem to fix.", "NTA. Your mean mother is just appalling, and for her to be doing what she's doing to your brother is sadistic. It's sad, BUT you and your dad aren't responsible for your mother's behavior or your brother's feelings.\n\nUnhappily, human relationships can last for a lifetime. Your dad is a prince for asking whether you wanted him to adopt your brother, especially when you consider what the presence of your brother in your dad's life symbolizes for your dad. It would be nice, and loving, but the ramifications of adopting his ex-wife's affair child are big.", "NTA.  \n\nYour mom & her family are abusing your brother.

I don't like telling kids their parents are TA, but your mom is. Your brother has a dad. It's not yours. And your dad is not responsible for that kiddo, sad as it may be that his dad isn't present. Worse, your mom has poisoned the well with your brother because he's all bitter thinking he's entitled to your dad. \n\nI say this as a kid from a blended family, with some pretty entitled step siblings, blended family nonsense, and me being a former step mom. Your dad is your dad. Unless he adopts your brother, he's not your brother's dad. \n\nHonestly, I'd go talk to the counselor at school, because you need an adult to speak to about this who is neutral, outside of wanting the best for you. \n\nMay I suggest speaking to Mom and brother at the same time? I'd also talk to your Dad so he knows what's coming, because this isn't going to make things better initially. Normally, I'd suggest that your dad do this, but you're old enough that you can take this on, if you want it. You're the one who has to live with them, and the boundaries should be the ones that you set.\n\n\"Mom, Brother, my dad is not Brother's dad. I realize that Brother's dad looks not so great compared to mine, but that's not on me or my dad to make up for. Mom, it's not fair you keep pushing this, and you've pushed Brother to think this is okay. You're hurting him, you're hurting me, you're hurting your relationship with both of us, and you're hurting my dad, who hasn't don't anything wrong. It needs to stop. My dad is my dad. Brother's Dad is Other Guy. That's not going to change. It might have been different, but the way both of you tried to force it - it's not going to be.\" \n\nDo not take comments. Do not engage. Walk out of there, to your room, or out of the house if you have somewhere to go. \n\nPeople who are hurt, and hurting - when they are confronted, they don't accept it well. They usually get worse before they get better. But this is where you have to put some boundaries in place. Not for them, because they sound, from your description, like they'll stomp all over them. But for you. \n\nMake a pact with yourself that once you say your piece, you don't discuss it. \"Mom/Brother, I said what I had to say. I'm not discussing this with you any further.\" Honestly, if mom and brother can't leave it be, I would talk with Dad about moving in with him. This issue is your mom's and sadly, she's made it your brother's, and they're both leaning on you to fix things, and make it right for them. \n\nNope. Not appropriate. I hope you update, because it sounds like you're doing a good job with people who are just relentless in terms of their POV and wants, and that is so tiring. \n\nGood luck.", "Calling you a shitty brother from shitty ratty relatives.
