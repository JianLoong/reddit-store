My wife and I were never asked if this would be ok, our home and our time was volunteered without our permission or blessing. I will not be watching any children and no one will be staying the night here. I truly hope you all understand as much as I do the importance of family and the need to protect our newborn. I am very sorry you were lied to. I will not be guilted into anything nor will my boundaries be trampled on family or not.  My wife and my newborn son are my #1 priority and will remain as such, so if anyone is planning on dropping a child off at our home I am advising you re-think that as we are letting our neighbors know if they see anyone drop a child off at our home they will notify us as well as the local PD for child abandonment, despite what my Father and Brother are telling everyone you do NOT have our permission to leave your children here.  I again apologize for any inconvenience that has been caused by the false information you were given by ( brothers name) and ( fathers name). I am saddened that the events of what should have been a very happy day for the family has turned to such a bad moment for our family, I want nothing more than to be supportive of my brother and his new family as well as his wedding and I am truly heartbroken that the feeling is clearly not mutual and has led to all of this.

I am deeply hurt and saddened you could do such an awful thing to my wife and I but most importantly how could you do this to you grandchild/nephew and put him in such danger. I will be making changes to ensure the safety of our son comes first and until you can prove that he and his health wellness and safety is also a priority in your life, you will be unable to meet our son until after they are 100% vaccinated and we deem it safe to do so. If this upsets you I hope you take a long look in the mirror and recognize that our decision has been made based on your actions/behaviors.
