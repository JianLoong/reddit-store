If she wants a tattoo of the son, go for it.  Also, I don\u2019t think it needs to be an issue now, you might change your mind in 10 years and get a tattoo with his name. I don\u2019t think it should be causing conflict this early in you son\u2019s life.\n\nHope the argument settles and all goes back to normal", "NAH\n\nHowever I think you're pretty ignorant if you can't see how that could look like favouritism.", "NAH. you get to decide what to do with your own body. However, your son will have a hard time understanding why you have a tattoo of his sister and not him.", "My dad has six kids, only one tattoo with one of my sister\u2019s name on it. Not a single one of care or are affected by it. \n\nWe do tease him though because the one name is my horrible sister that we all hate and who treats him like shit all the time. He gets a lot of \u201cglad you got HER name, eh?\u201d jokes. \n\nIt\u2019s your wife that\u2019s being a jealous mama bear. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your explanation for not wanting one is good enough and he will understand. Your wife is acting jealous stepmother. Like you said if she wants one she should get it herself. It is your body and she needs to respect your choice.", "NAH.\n\nI was all ready to say YTA from the title, because that sort of favoritism sets up problems, but all the time in between does change things for me. If you were to make the decision today, presumably, you wouldn't get EITHER child's name tattooed on your chest. Young people do all sorts of things that they wouldn't do as adults, and you shouldn't be forced to make all the same mistakes again just to be \"even\". \n\nHowever, be careful how you talk to your wife about this. It's a legitimate concern that your son will feel second-priority because you have a tattoo of your other child but not him. This is not \"insane\", and I would also generally expect someone who tattooed his first child onto his chest to do the same for his second child. You're edging into asshole territory for treating this as a ridiculous concern out of nowhere, rather than a legit issue that (although you have agency over your own body) deserves some honest discussion and communication.\n\nBTW, some of this is based on the assumption that \"when I was young\" is a really long time ago. I'm thinking like a decade or more. If we're only talking about, say, 4 years between and you've been married to your new wife for 3 of them, then YTA. Can you clarify how long it has been since your first child and related tattoo?", "~~NAH: She's right. Your son will want to know why you did tattoo of his sister and not one of him.~~\n\nOkay, after reading the comments I'm going with YTA. You won't remove a tattoo because your daughter will be devastated, but you won't get a tattoo if your son is hurt you don't have one of him? That's a double standard. \n\nIt's your body and you can do whatever you want but don't use your daughter as an excuse if you don't want to remove her tattoo and then say you're not into tattoos and it's your body so you son will have to deal.", "I'm undecided, but maybe instead of a tattoo express your love and effection for your son in a different way.", "INFO: are there any viable options?

I think this is the case because despite you having every right to not want to get another tattoo, you have to see the optics of it.\n\nNo matter what you can say, it will still have an air of favoritism around it. Granted your wife might not be the best person to approach the subject. I think thats best done by your son when he gets old enough an understands the situation.\n\nIf he sees a problem with it, I would be prepared to get that next tattoo...\n\nSaying it was painful and that you dont want to do it because of that is a pretty weak cop-out....he could respond to that \"well it was painful back then too, why could you deal with it then but not now?\"  or \" so you saw that your sacrafice to her was worth the pain, but how is your love towards me any different?\" \n\nYoure desire to not have another tattoo doesnt garner my judgement, but your mindset of not being open to getting one should your son want you to in later years, which he wouldn't be wrong in asking for.

It's your body and your choice whether or not to get another tattoo.", "NTA. It\u2019s only a big deal if she makes it one. I\u2019m sure explaining when she\u2019s older will be fine because you have very valid reasons. Like you said, she thinks there needs to be a tattoo for the new baby let her get one.", "YTA she\u2019s completely right. To have 1 kid and not the other is just a slap in the fucking face. Another dude posted on here a while back and I said the same thing your wife did. Your son is going to look at that and think you don\u2019t love him just as much. I really don\u2019t understand why parents do this to their kids. You are messed up for this", "NTA if the kid notices it's as simple as telling the kid, \"I love you, but tattoos hurt and I didn't want to go through that again because it was unpleasant.\"", "NAH\n\nIt is absolutely your decision whether to have a tattoo. No one will ever be an AH for exercising bodily autonomy in my book. \n\nHowever, from the perspective of your wife I can undstand where she's coming from. It would hurt to single one child out over the other. While I know that's not what you're doing, the optics could suggest it.", "NTA! It's your body. \n\nSomeday your son will ask about the tattoo, and you'll tell him a sad story about parting with your first child, and how glad you are that you didn't have to leave him behind in the same way. You don't need a tattoo of his name. You *have him right there.*", "YTA for calling your wife insane over her expressing something that may be a possibility. You don't necessarily have to get the tattoo and will have plenty of opportunity to show your son love in the future but it's completely valid for a kid to still feel jealous and insecure over something his sibling has over him. If your wife is bringing this up, sprouting body rights or suggesting she get a tattoo, is not a good indication of said communication skills you plan on using on your son.", "NTA we do things differently as we get older. You're right about her getting one if it's such a big deal to her", "NTA. You were still young and thought It was a good idea at that time . You can just explain the story behind the tattoo to your other kid when he gets older so no one feels any jealousy or that you favor one kid over the other. You have the right to refuse putting something permanent on your body. If your wife thinks It's so unfair, she can get the tattoo herself.", "YTA.  Your son will clearly see this as favoritism.", "From the post itself, I was gonna say N A H. But reading your comments, YTA. You said yourself that all parents have favourites, you also say your daughter's gonna be devastated if you remove her tattoo but don't seem to care what your son will feel when he grows up, so I guess... we know who the favourite is. And yes, that tattoo will be a very physical manifestation of the truth, that you won't be able to hide.", "NTA she can't dictate that you get a tattoo on your own body if you don't want to.  \n\nI understand her feelings of favoritism, but also your shared child is only one year old, this is not a discussion you need to be having today.  Someday when he's older he may ask about your daughter tattoo, and you can talk to him about it then, but arguing about it now when the child is a baby is pointless.", "NTA your kid will know the circumstances of his sister's birth and his, and will not feel like he is the least favourite unless you treat him like that. Literally if you don't treat him like second best, he probably won't give a shit about the tattoo \n\nSide note, my friend's dad has a tattoo of my friend's face on his arm and the friend absolutely hated it growing up, he was extremely embarrassed.", "YTA", "You had to leave your daughter and were trying to keep her close to your heart.\nYour son has you now and you can physically hug and hold him close any time.\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA. Your body, your choice. Maybe consult a family therapist for suggestions on how to successfully navigate this, but I feel like you can explain as having something to represent her while you had to be apart for an extended period of time but that you\u2019re lucky enough to not have to do that with him.

It certainly didn't make me feel unloved whether it was the case or not.\n\nYour children will have lead very different lives, and in many ways, the son will come out ahead because you had him later in life.

I very much doubt that your son will hold the tattoo against you.  Getting a tattoo doesn't magically make you love one child more or less.  You can easily show your son that you love him just as much as his older sister through your actions throughout his life.\n\nI feel like if your wife is a reasonable person she will understand if you just tell her you'll be using your deeds and not a tattoo to show your son how much you love him and then follow through with that.  If you want to mollify her further, why not just get a piece of jewelry that you regularly wear that symbolizes your bond with your son.
