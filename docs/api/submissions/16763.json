They received the standard 90 day notice from their landlady, but still struggled to keep up with the rent due to not spending responsibly.\n\nFae and Max asked me if I could help them financially. I respectfully told them no. (If they had been in debt because something unavoidable drained their savings (like medical expenses) I would have taken from my own savings. But that isn\u2019t what happened here.)\n\nFae and Max decided to sell one of their cars. Max has to take the bus to work on certain mornings now. But they are now fully caught up with their rent payments and have become more responsible with their spending.\n\nI have a close friend \u201cJim\u201d with two young daughters. His youngest\u2019s crib used to be in he and his wife\u2019s room, but now she is too old for the crib and will be sharing a room with her sister.\n\nJim casually mentioned this to me, and that he felt bad, since having two normal beds in that room would be tight. I had a bunk bed that I used to share with a roommate. It\u2019s just been sitting around in storage, so I offered it to Jim for free as long as he helped me move it.\n\nMy parents recently moved into a new house and held a small housewarming party. Jim and his wife attended as well, as we\u2019ve been friends for years and consider each other family. During the party, Jim brought his daughters up to me to \u201cThank auntie OP for giving us your bunk bed.\u201d\n\nFae happened to be in the dining room as well when that happened. She and Max came up to me after the other guests left and said they were disappointed that I had given the bunk bed to Jim when I could have easily sold it to help them with their rent situation.\n\nFae and Max acknowledged that I had no technical obligation to help with their rent. But said it was about morals and that since I was choosing to be generous, I should have prioritized actual family over Jim.\n\nMy father wanted me to apologize to Fae and Max, since I could have easily gotten two or three hundred for the bunk bed and that would have helped them a lot before they had to sell one of their cars. My mother told me not to, because Fae and Max are responsible for themselves and I was allowed to do something generous for Jim.\n\nI still feel bad, since Fae and Max had to sell one of their cars and relying on the bus is inconvenient. I still don\u2019t think that I should have to apologize for doing a generous thing for a friend. But I know I\u2019m biased.
