By the post saying they've been getting better about being financially responsible, and either this is a miss step or an opportunity for them to be kindly reminded (or otherwise so they realize) that being responsible for themselves means not blaming family for gifting them money", "As I've said about other posts, the logic gymnastics with some people is amazing! OP was supposed to sell their property to then give the money away??? And give that money to people who aren't fiscally responsible? Please...", "Especially since most bunk beds are kinda cheap to begin with and don't really hold up that well. A hand-me down bunk bed from someone you know is great if it suits the needs of the friends, but it's kinda sketch on the second hand market.", "Yeah, they more often end up on freecycle.", "Ya I was really surprised how hard it was to sell my lazyboy couch recently. It was definitely used but the recliner mechanisms worked perfectly, there were no rips or stains in the leather. I ended up selling it for $150. Granted it would not stop snowing and that probably didn't help.", "Huh?! Not where I\u2019m from. There are whole careers based on thrift flipping.", "MIB! \u201cOkay, slick. But let me tell you something about all your skills. As of right now, they mean precisely... dick.\u201d Your brain must\u2019ve pulled that up from the depths, lol.", "Where I am, I\u2019d be scared to take secondhand furniture due to bed bugs or roaches", "But, on the other hand, I don't think a lot of rich people are buying a MCM bunk bed as an accent piece or whatever.", "NTA It\u2019s honestly really entitled of them to even bring it up.", "You won't be able to rent a car without a credit card here. Many hotels refuse to take cash at check-in. Debit and credit card only. Some have gone entirely cashless. \n\nCredit cards are worth it when you suddenly have to pay for a new car transmission or $600 in medical bills or your washer and dryer died and need to be replaced now.", "Credit score is worked into a lot IN NORTH AMERICA. In Europe it just affects whether you can get financing or credit cards.", "NTA you probably would have been lucky to get 100 for the bunk beds, they had to sell a CAR to get out of debt. The bunk bed money wouldn\u2019t have put a dent in their debt.", "Nta. They need to grow up and be financially responsible. Being generous to someone actually in need should never be used against you.", "NTA - especially as you would be the one to have to wait till people came to see it and have a bunch of lookee lose waste your time and then maybe sell it for a couple of hundred bucks just to give away. Your family is ridiculous.", "NTA, she acknowledge that you don't owe her any help so the moral thing they need to do is shut up and fix their finances rather than guilt trip other people into helping them", "NTA- if you sold the bed and given the money to F&M it would be enabling their poor spending habits. You said it yourself, because they sold their car and having to take public transport, they are realizing that they have to change their ways. Now, they are \u201cmore responsible with their spending\u201d. If you helped them this month, what would happen next month or the following month, etc? You also showed generosity to kids and a dad that were appreciative and not entitled. Win on all accounts.", "Bunk beds don\u2019t sell. I have been selling furniture for years. The more expensive, the less interest as those with means will have their own bed. \n\nThat\u2019s just an aside. Not your circus, not your monkey. Nta", "NTA, don't feel bad at all. They are the ones who didn't budget correctly. Expecting you to sell your bunk beds and give the money to them is flat out absurd. You helped out those children rather than Jim and honestly, they needed it more than your brother needed the money. Your brother is an adult and that's his fault if he can't pay the rent, he is not the only person who has had their rent raised---what about Jim? Maybe his rent got raised too and he couldn't afford to buy his kids bunk beds. I can't believe your brother is that big of an asshole he'd deny those kids a bed because he needs money. It's not his bunk bed to give away and you told him no, you're not giving him money, not because you don't have it but because you didn't want to.", "NTA, not only is it not your responsibility to sell your things to help them out but unless this is some amazingly special bunk bed I imagine you'd be hard pressed to get 200-300 dollars for it. I bought my kids bunk bed brand new for $175.", "The audacity of some people. Maybe if Fae and Max acted as adults and got their shit together they wouldn't be rowing the boat they are. They did it to themselves. But not only that they expect you to sell your posessions and give them the money for it. Talk about entitlement! That is some confidence right there. Not to even feel an ounce of shame, but to expect that you and yours fork over money because they are irresponsible. Your dad has lost his mind. What kind of parent gets in the middle and he expects you to apologize? For What?! Dad needs a healthy dose of wake the eff up and see the truth. NTA at all.", "NTA- I\u2019m really confused by your family\u2019s logic. It was your property to do with as you wished. And you actually gave it to someone that needed it rather than sell it for profit. They have decided to triage their issues over someone else\u2019s and with your resources. \n\nIt sounds like this couple is reaping some of the consequences of their own actions and are angry that you\u2019re not bailing them out. They had options before their situation got to the state it was in, but decided to continue as they were and then putting themselves in a tougher spot. That\u2019s fine- they were free to choose and now they have the results of that choice. \n\nThis is just wild and comes across as them being very entitled!", "Omg, don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep those people warm! They need to learn how to spend responsibly, and they\u2019ll never learn if they keep getting bailed out. They need to face actual consequences.", "NTA. If irresponsibility was the root cause of their financial troubles, having you as a safety net would have only enabled them further. This is coming from someone who used to be very bad with money around the ages of 21-23, my older brother sent me money a few times until he finally put a stop to it. I know that it took a lot for him to do that, but he had his own bills to pay and a savings account to contribute to! He loved being able to do that for me, but at a certain point - enough is enough.\n\nIt lit a fire under my ass! I mean, if it weren't for my family I know I would have been in much bigger trouble but just because your family CAN help you doesn't mean they should. Especially when you're working a full-time job with a liveable salary. So, no, NTA. They will thank you in the future.", "NTA- They're not entitled to your bunk bed money just because they're going they a rough time. We've all been there, it sucks but they have to learn to be financially responsible.", "NTA your mom is right. Unreasonable spending probably got them in that situation in the first place. Like who expected a bunk bed to go for 300 bucks. No way in hell a used bunk bed would go for that much. If that\u2019s how they view finances then that\u2019s on them", "NTA and it sounds like Fae is your Dad's favorite.  You did the right thing on both accounts.", "NTA. This is ridiculous. Live your life.", "NTA - brother and sister in law need to take accountability for their actions. You weren\u2019t looking at it as a business transaction with Jim, he had a need you had a solution. Had a Jim not mentioned the space issue that bunk bed would still be in storage and you still wouldn\u2019t have thought of it as an option for money. Are you supposed to go through your house and pile up everything you don\u2019t want for your brother to come over and pick through to see if he can get any money from it? Ridiculous!!", "NTA You are, quite literally, not your brother's keeper.", "And if she had sold it for their benefit they never would have had the chance to learn", "They weren\u2019t trying to sell it. They were giving an extra bed to a friend.  If the bro/SIL needed a bed they probably would have got it.", "Unless it\u2019s like some pottery barn quality bunk bed, lol. But yeah.", "The ones I got were solid oak and perfect looking.  So I question the pottery barns resale value.", "Now I do too, lol. Never seen ones like that at Salvation Army, only the metal type ones.", "One thing to know is not having and using a credit card can make your credit score less than great if you apply for a mortgage or bank loan.", "Um why are you saying this is just an American thing.\n\nMost British people have credit cards. How do you expect to get a mortgage without credit?", "And even in the US, if you can pay in cash you don't need to worry so much about your credit score. There are things it'll be helpful for, like getting a cellphone on a plan, but.. paying in cash is still something that can be done. It's just hard because many people either don't make the kind of money that lets you buy a house in cash, or they just don't know how to save properly. Credit is crazy. \ud83d\ude02", "Lol unless that bunk bed was like, a log style set or Pottery Barn you\u2019d have seen maybe $100 for it\n\nThey had to sell a car. $300 wasn\u2019t gonna make much difference. They had to make lifestyle changes, not sell the furniture or extended family\n\nNTA", "NTA.. tho I am scratching my head to figure out how two able bodied working adults without kids cannot afford rent, without some excruciating life event..", "NTA - and don\u2019t go down that road unless you are willing to contribute to their living expenses forever.  I speak from experience.", "NTA. They won't learn unless they're forced to. - from someone who is also bad with money (although not that bad!)", "Oh the entitlement of family lol", "NTA", "NTA - they are responsible for themselves fully. It's not your job to make sacrifices to save them. I mean, they expected you to go through the hassle of selling something yourself then hand over the money instead of helping someone else out? They are pure AHs and deserve all the strife they have.", "NTA Fae and Max are not entitled to your money, full stop. You already told them no when they asked for your help. If you sold the bunk bed you that money would have been for yourself, not them. \n\nAsk your Dad to apologize to Fae and Max for spending money on moving and the housewarming party rather than giving them that money for their rent (assuming that there were costs). See how quick he turns around on that. \n\nThe same morals would be at play for your parents if there were any.", ">Fae and Max are responsible for themselves and I was allowed to do something generous for Jim\n\n>due to not spending responsibly.\n\nThey choose their path. If they don't get themselves out of the mess they made they will never learn. \n\nYou were helping someone. \n\nCompared to the car the bunkbed was mere pennies\n\nNTA", "There crap load of stuff on the Nextdoor app, for low or no money, that no one takes, bears this out.", "This and also. You get a credit card with a decent cashback bonus and no annual fee; usually the cashback will be in the 1%-2% range aside from certain types of transactions. You spend ALL your regular monthly bills (no fun stuff, necessities only, food water electricity gas etc.) on the credit card - unless the company charges a transaction fee to use credit instead of cash/checking - and pay the credit card off in full before the due date every month. Next month, apply the accumulated cashback bonus to your card when you start paying bills. And just like that, you're getting a 1%-2% discount on all your regular living expenses and building credit history while not incurring interest. You may eventually want multiple cards for different purposes, such as one with a better bonus on gas station purchases or one with a better bonus on grocery purchases."]}
