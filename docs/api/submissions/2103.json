(For background, I know he cheated. He claims he did not and hid it all very well but I know he did).  Now they\u2019re expecting their first child and my daughter is obviously very excited to be a big sister. \n\nThe other day she asked me who I was going to be to her little sister, and I told her I wasn\u2019t anything to it. She seemed confused so I had to explain to her that even though me and her father had her together he decided that he wanted to have a family with someone else so I wasn\u2019t involved with this kid. She asked if that means the kid won\u2019t be coming to my house and I said nope, then she asked if the kid would be able to go to her grandparents (my parents) and I told her no again and she got pretty upset at that. \n\nSo I guess when she went to her fathers she was still upset and she told them why and to comfort her I guess the new wife told her that when the baby got older they could have sleepovers here so she came home all excited for that. (She\u2019s also told my daughter that we\u2019d go on vacations together\u2026.etc). \n\nI don\u2019t want this kid at my house, I don\u2019t want it over for sleepovers or vacation or anything. I told my daughter that and she got upset. Our next exchanged my ex said I was an AH and I should\u2019ve just pacified her and not shoot down every idea his new wife has.

That's not a lie, and it doesn't have to be more in depth. Second, you could explain that anything else will be handled on a case by case basis. Until she's old enough to understand that you don't have any obligation to this child, you just say no, not right now. Right now she doesn't understand. Lastly, you could tell your daughter that your house and her daddy's house are different households, and while you co-parent her, you guys have unique say over your own houses.

Isnt anything wrong with setting boundaries but firstly you are setting them through the wrong person, there is also a difference between being honest and being bitter. \nA 6yr doesn't need to understand at that age so bluntly why her parents are not together, \n\nA childs perspective on situations is formed based on what is told to them and taught, which also can become learnt behaviours or later on in life toxic traits. \n\nYes I understand your ex husband has messed up but the point his CHILD will be her sister and your CHILD is excited to be a sibling! You are tainting your child's ability to experience the excitement of being a sibling because you are in your feelings and you are actually projecting your bitterness towards the situation onto your CHILD, you are convincing yourself you are being truthful and she needs to hear it, when really all she needs to do is be a KID. You need to grow up and speak to your ex and the gf if it's causing such an issue so you are all able to get to a point of co-parenting whatever that may involve, cause at the end of the day it isn't about you, your feelings, your ex husband or his new gf.\nIt's about the kids. \n\nSo maybe stop putting your child in between shit she cannot really comprehend at this age. \n\nYeah cheating sucks but there is a child involved.

They will never understand why you drove a wedge into their family.\n\nI get it. I was one (of four) half-siblings to the eldest sister split between two homes. Our mother hated her father for having primary custody of their daughter. Her father had 2 more and our mother had 2 more, and we never communicated with each other because \u201cwe were nothing to each other.\u201d My sister to this day feels disconnected in some way to all of us because her parents couldn\u2019t put their petty hatred aside for their daughter to love their family fully. She was always \u201ccloser\u201d to her sisters on her dad\u2019s side but has nothing in common with them like she does with my sister and me, who are younger and more distanced from her. Now she is in her 30s and trying to have a sisterly connection to all 4 of her siblings, but her parents still do not want us all to communicate even though we are all adults. Do you want that for your daughter? Do be distanced from her family, from people who love her, just because of you and your failed relationships?", "YTA\nYou told a 6 year old child her father wanted to start a new family with someone else.

They're valid. But they shouldn't involve your child and the independent relationships they're building. She's excited to have a sibling! Let her be! Sure no sleepovers for now but you're capable of compromising so you could do play dates or something. \nI wouldn't say the baby cant go to the Grandparents either because they may love to have their grandbabies sibling over! You can't make decisions like that for other people. \n\nThis comes across as unbelievably bitter and sounds borderline like you're trying to put seeds of resentment towards her father and stepmom by speaking poorly about them to her and that's sad.

Can't blame him", "Well agree to disagree.\n\nJust to make it clear. It's not a huge jump. It really is not. That's the only logical explanation. Literally no one would think he didn't cheat so OP's feelings aren't invalid either. \n\nIn my opinion, he did cheat. \n\nBut whatever the case, his new wife has no fucking right to cross all of OP's boundaries. She's majorly crossing all the lines. She needs to stay in her lane. OP's life and her home ain't her business. OP has made it clear what she wants yet they keep forcing her to play a happy family. What his wife is doing is fucked up, no matter what. They don't have a happy family, don't drag OP into this. \n\nSo him cheating or no cheating has no bearing on the fact that OP has no desire to blend their families and neither does she care about their new sibling. The wife needs to majorly back off. \n\nBut yeah in my opinion he did cheat.", "They can\u2019t use shit against me anyway We already have a custody agreement and there\u2019s no way the courts are going to take custody away from me", "The link I literally just gave you says that.\n\nMy question:\n\n> Have you called your ex\u2019s wife a \u201clittle girl\u201d to your child? Have you called their new baby an \u201cit\u201d?\n\nOP\u2019s response:\n\n> I\u2019ve told her the truth about what her father did so yup. And I call the baby am it because I don\u2019t know if it is actually a girl or of my daughter just calls it that because she wants one.\n\nThat\u2019s word for word. She said \u201cyup\u201d to the first question.", "No shit.  The second wife could have been new to the neighborhood in the last 5 or 6 years fo all we know.", "Sorry, I said 25 for when they divorced and he was apparently already cheating with her. It was the best estimate I had for when the relationship \u201cstarted\u201d. You are right that she is 28 now.", "That makes it even worse, my god. I was considering the cheating and little girl thing separately, not together.", "Maybe he just wanted to leave a raging asshole lol", "Here we generally do \u201cthey\u201d. Unless someone specifically requests to be called \u201cit\u201d, it is very dehumanizing, because it is what is used for objects, *not* people. Or just trust that her daughter knows what she\u2019s talking about and use she.\n\nTo be honest, that\u2019s not my highest concern though. It\u2019s the general \u201cI tell it like it is so that means telling my daughter the story of her father cheating and calling her 28-year-old step mother a little girl\u201d attitude that is the big issue to me. \u201cIt\u201d would not create the problem on it\u2019s own, but it adds to the already existing one.", "Oh a feeling? In that case, of course she\u2019s right! Who needs evidence of anything when you can just claim feelings? /s", "My ex did the same thing to me. Don\u2019t worry about it. You know what he did, he knows and she knows.", "If your husband finds this post with your comments, he could use it in court as proof of parental alienation.", "It\u2019s a good thing all your nasty comments are here forever", "But there\u2019s literally no indication he cheated. She just thinks he did and let\u2019s be honest she\u2019s not exactly a reliable narrator.  She\u2019s just bitter because he didn\u2019t want to be married to her anymore and based on her post and comments 100% don\u2019t blame him", "OP *believes* her ex was cheating.", "This is very possible. I was giving her the benefit of the doubt there but in retrospect she probably does not deserve it.", "If he remarried in less than a year, I am inclined to believe it too", "While a year isn't that long, it's not exactly short either. Plenty of couples get married within a year of meeting each other, and even if the ex and his new wife knew each other before it still doesn't prove they were having an affair."]}
