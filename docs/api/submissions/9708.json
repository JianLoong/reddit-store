Why was the engagement broke off? Why is he not wanting to talk to them? Is the reason you let them in really only because you didn't want to hear them knock? What was the conversation about you had with them?", "YTA\n\nTo say that he\u2019s gone back on all of your agreements would mean that he was respecting all of them up until this.

But there\u2019s enough here to infer a few things.\n\nFirst, saying your ex broke the engagement implies it wasn\u2019t a mutual decision so perhaps you are hurt/angry etc.  Adding that when your ex broke off the engagement his parents were not pleased indicates they are favouring you in this situation. You letting them in suggests you (maybe just subconsciously) welcome their interference as it validates you.  We\u2019re you hoping they would change his mind or just looking to have him properly scolded?\n\nTBH I don\u2019t think any of that matters - what matters is that you are living in an uncomfortable situation that could easily become a dangerous one.

At any rate get out of the house you two are toxic together.", "YTA. You blatantly interfered with their personal life. You crossed a line by letting them in. Their parents and that situation is none of your business. If you don't want them knocking, open the door, tell them the ex isn't there and to come back latter. If they don't, you'll call the cops.

Put a lock on your door, stay in your room as much as posible - not only will it save you from engaging with him - but it will also push you to do what you need to in order to leave.  At this point, I'd consider a temporary move quickly (your parents, a friend, even his parents, ha ) instead of staying there.", "This whole situation is toxic.

Also, what led him to believe that your parents were the main factor new to getting married? It doesn't seem like an assumption like that, comes out of nowhere.", "YTA completely. You purposely caused a problem. If he is not respecting your boundaries now, it is because you first did not respect his.

She had not right to let them in, especially since what else would happen? A calm, collective, constructive discussion? No, she is clearly a shit stirrer. I love how she even left the drama.\n\nThrow a hand grenade in the room and bounce. Classic AH move.", "NTA- it\u2019s not okay for him to expect you to sit there for an hour with them knocking at the door. He needs to ether call the police or communicate with them that he\u2019s unwilling to talk, but making you suffer through their knocking, avoiding leaving to not have to interact with them and such is not okay.\n\nUnless he asked you to call the police and you let them in instead\u2026\n\nHe\u2019s not been respecting your boundaries by letting his parents repeatedly block the door and knock forever, that would cause such anxiety for me, even if listening to music through headphones to ignore it. All he\u2019s doing now is respecting them less due to retaliation.\n\nHe is TA, and you\u2019re lucky to discover this childish behavior before getting married.", "Why didn\u2019t you let them sit outside and wait for him? This is an ESH situation, with you unnecessarily putting yourself in the middle.

See if they\u2019d just sat on the porch and waited right, you\u2019d have had the same result without him being able to blame you.", "ESH\n\nYou knew he didn\u2019t want to see them. His behavior is reprehensible. The entire relationship sounds like it\u2019s in a tailspin.", "Yta, you reap what you sow.", "ESH. By letting them in, you forced a confrontation between them. He is also TA for being an immature jerk. His family are AH for not leaving him alone.", "YTA. If he wanted to talk with his parents he would have. It is not your place to stomp on his boundaries and then cry when he doesn't respect yours anymore.\n\nMy best bet- you are hoping his parents will make him reconsider and marry you, since for all intents and purposes this sounds like an arranged marriage.", "Info why should he care about your rules when you dont care about his", "YTA \n\nHe went no contact, and you let them in. If they were bugging you, then you tell them he's not there and you call the police if they don't leave.", "So you did it on purpose just to start a fight and make him look bad?\nYTA", "YTA", "No wonder he broke off your engagement. You deliberately sabotaged his wish to handle his parents in his own way.\n\nYou interfered with his way of keeping them from creating arguments. You say he's gone back on agreements with you, but it was you who went back on the most important agreement--not to let his parents into his living space.", "Deal with it how? Like kick op out now?", "Yes Yta", "Normally I'd go full everybody sucks here but, really, after what you did, you've **earned** a YTA. I'm sorry he's being petty and it makes you uncomfortable, but you asked for it.", "well, esh, you should not have let them in as you knew he was gonna get angry and he should not act as a child with you and his parents, i think is good s think you didn't get married.", "You indicated that he had specifically asked you not to let them in but you did it anyway.  You could have simply answered the door and told them that he wasn't in.  You knew that letting them in would likely cause problems but you let them in anyway.\n\nYou have upset what was from your description, a relatively cordial breakup and turned it into a not particularly cordial breakup. \n\nYTA", "ESH", " YTA", "YTA, the current situation in is the result of your own actions. your ex was being kind to you while you still lived with him and you did something you knew would upset him. What did you think would happen?", "YTA. Yeah. You made that bed. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Except buy going \u201cback on her agreement\u201d as you put it he\u2019s sexually harassing her now by walking around pretty much naked.  That\u2019s pretty cool. And like you said, she asked for the sexual harassment and has to \u201cdeal with the consequences \u201c. I  would hate to date you.\n\nThat being said ESH overall", "I think this is projection. I'm guessing that he doesn't want to talk to his parents because it was actually him marrying you to make his parents happy and he needs space from them in order to break up with you. \n\nI'm not going to provide a judgment on this because I think his explanation for throwing away the future the two of you had planned was shocking and confusing to you and you were hoping that his parents could help set him straight. \n\nLetting his parents in was wrong. Letting anybody into the place he lives when he expressly stated his need that they not be let into his home was wrong. But it sounds like you were in a very confusing space and he did cause that confusion with that ridiculous explanation for breaking up with you. You deserve something that at least resembles the truth.\n\nIn the meantime, get out of there. You two need a ton of space from each other right now before this continues to escalate."]}
