Or that there are things between your mom and Caleb that you aren't aware of?\n\nI also find it a huge stretch to say he abandoned your family after the fire - if anything, he created more space in the basement for your mom and her 6 underage children. He might not have been able to financially contribute, and even if he was, he's not obligated to do so just because your mom had a large amount of kids to feed and take care of.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA. You come six siblings after Caleb which means you probably have no idea what growing up was like for him. It's really weird that you think he should have been helping with bills at 15 when he was still a child. It sounds like your SIL is trying to protect her husband who experienced some neglect as a child, if your mom carries a lot of guilt about that time maybe she should address that in therapy.", "Meh this one is tough. I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here. Theresa is just trying to help your brother and you are trying to help your mom. Ultimately this whole situation is between your brother and your mom. You should stay out of it. Your brother is telling you as much by setting boundaries. You will be the AH if you keep inserting yourself. Theresa should stay out of it too IMO.\n\nEdit for grammar errors.", "Are you more upset about the birthday or losing your wifi.", "I lean towards YTA. \n\nPart of growing up is understanding that your siblings can have a very different understanding of your childhood than you do, and just because you experienced your parents one way does not mean your siblings got the same parent. \n\nYour brother was 18. Him moving out and not contributing towards bills isn\u2019t him abandoning the family - is that the narrative and tone your family normally uses when discussing Caleb? It\u2019s not abnormal for 18 year olds to move out, and while it would have been nice for him to pitch in, it definitely shouldn\u2019t have been the expectation. \n\nYour mom had a lot on her plate - that\u2019s understandable and I think Theresa should cut her more slack. But if your brother felt neglected and he was very clearly experiencing a lot of judgment from your family based on how you frame him moving out - Theresa had to support him and pick up the pieces through that. I\u2019m not surprised she doesn\u2019t trust your family to be gentle and considerate of your brother\u2019s feelings when you seem to be continually dismissive or judgmental of his experience of his childhood (he says mom forgot his birthday several times but you can\u2019t remember that so it didn\u2019t happen, you say him moving out at 18 was abandoning the family). \n\nYour approach to this wasn\u2019t great either. You shouldn\u2019t have confronted Theresa over it. You could talk to your brother and tell him how this is impacting mom, but you also need to be compassionate towards what his experience was.", "YTA.

I'm glad she has a conscience.", "NTA.\nThey are acting like babies. The past is in the past. You should move on, not trying to make someone miserable over a little thing. You did good taking your moms side. You Better cut ties with them because they are not giving a sh*t about your struggle.", "NTA.  It seems Theresa doesn't care if she hurts your mom, as Theresa thinks your mom deserves to be punished.   But raising that many kids without help?  She's lucky she survived with most of her sanity intact.  So Theresa needs to cut mom some slack.", "NTA for asking your SIL to stop harassing your mum but I'm going to say N A H for the rest. I think your mum did the best she could under the circumstances and I've no doubt that she's an amazing woman. That said, this probably isn't just about her forgetting Caleb's birthday. Even if your mum did her best, there's probably some \"neglect\" (I can't think of a better word) that Caleb feels that he's discussed with his wife and she's trying to make sure that he doesn't feel like that again. Your SIL needs to leave your mum alone though.", "NTA.   \nTheresa is taking this too far, she is thinking only of Caleb, not of the rest of your family. And she\u2019s defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong, or because she\u2019s fixed thinking/pig headed/stubborn and can\u2019t see the damage this might be causing your mum even when it\u2019s pointed out.   \n\n\nDon\u2019t talk to Theresa in future, only to Caleb. Tell Caleb how your mum feels to get these texts and ask him to resolve it - that you know he was so very obviously oh so very very hurt when she forgot his birthday, but the wider context was\u2026 and that you hope that Caleb and your mum can solve this because it hurts you to see both of them so hurt with each other that Caleb has his wife texting her year on year about this. That should sort it. I suspect Caleb is annoyed but has no idea your mother cries every year about these texts, and that his wife knows this (and is being a real bitch it keep it up knowing it)\u2026 if it continues then Caleb is putting a line in the sand about it, and you can withdraw contact / assume he\u2019s a pig headed person and decide you can\u2019t fix pig headed ness/have a better life without his stupidity. \n\n  \nYou should find a new source of internet.

If you were 10 years older I\u2019d say Y T A but I think you are early 20s and still growing up. You could all do with some therapy. If you are 30 then I\u2019d be saying YTA.", "Yta but based on your replies to other comments I doubt you will be able to understand that.", "I maybe get downvoted but I think the only real AH here is the father. \n\nYes the mum is wrong for causing her son to feeling neglected, BUT it was not done on purpose. Because their father abandoned their family:\n1. The mum is now a single mum to a bunch of kids (some that aren\u2019t even her own). \n2.Mum now has no financial stability and has to work two jobs just to keep her children fed, clothes, warm and housed.\n3. Because mum is working every free minute to provide for her children she is unable provide the emotional support for her children. \n\nWhile yes it is her job to emotionally support her children, she is carrying the load of two people. It\u2019s a very hard job that doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit. Obviously, Caleb won\u2019t understand this as a child. All he knows is that his dads left and his mum is never around. Of course, he\u2019s going to feel neglected. \nNone of you deserved the situation you were put into. \n\nSo let\u2019s place the blame on the right person, the deadbeat dad. \n\nOP your mum and brother may benefit from having a sit down and have a honest discussion about his childhood and her experience as a single mum so they can understand each others point of view. \n\nOP while you\u2019re not the AH for wanting to protect your mum, you cannot minimise your brothers experiences. He will be feeling abandoned by both parents and you need to recognise that. \n\nAlso OP you should really lay off Theresa, she\u2019s sticking up for her husband who is obviously dealing with a lot of painful emotions. The only side of your mother see\u2019s seen is your brothers perspective.", "Info: You keep mentioning the birthday reminder, but you never made any mention of the wording.

I would explain more but your more pressing issue needs to be upping your mother's quality of life. She clearly cared for you all and a simple birthday reminder that most would look at as a chance to help schedule a dinner or something is causing a breakdown means she needs help. \n\nIf your mother is constantly getting triggered by things as simple as a reminder of someone's birthday which is fairly common in many families to do, she needs therapy. Hell having that bad of an experience as a single mother she needs it regardless. \n\nCrying over a birthday reminder isn't the cause of your mother's crying, it is a very tiny straw that broke the camels back, and the underlying issues need addressed.", "YTA completely. \n\nCaleb\u2019s relationship with his mother and his wife are none of your business.

She woke up crying because in the dream she sent me to school and it was a normal day for me and she felt so guilty. She still will randomly bring up how horrible it made her feel and that was only a dream. Your mum isn't an AH for forgetting because she was suffering from PTSD and had days before been in a traumatic event and was then living in a basement with her children. She would be the AH if she had the same mentality as you, in that he abandoned you by not living in a basement with you all and paying her his wages. It is down to your mother to speak to her DIL and son. You are a big AH though for speaking of your brothers experiences as your own. They are not.

It\u2019s understandable you want to defend your mom but actions have consequences and if your brother now wants to limit contact that\u2019s his business.

Theresa may be taking this too far, but you were born down the line so have no idea what Caleb's childhood was like.", "YTA. \n\nI would bet serious money that you have - at BEST - a fraction of the story of Caleb's childhood   as well as the reasons why as to the dynamic between Caleb and your mother. \n\nIt's great that you feel your mom was an amazing one to you. It's unlikely that she was an amazing mom to all of your siblings, especially the older ones, given that many children and what you describe as far as finances, living conditions, her PTSD, etc. \n\nSome of the things you say sound like things your mom has spoon-fed you over the years to the point that you've internalized them as your own beliefs, such as framing an adult Caleb moving in with his girlfriend and not helping your mom out with bills as \"abandonment\" when it's simply a normal step in growing up. \n\nEverything you describe about Theresa reads - to me - as a protective spouse who is trying to prevent her husband from being further hurt by his family of origin while still remaining in some form of contact with them. \n\nThat your response to anything is to absolve your mother of any wrongdoing and demand Caleb \"justify\" his feelings by naming any recent hurts is further proof that Theresa is likely onto something here. \n\nCaleb doesn't owe you proof of anything, and he doesn't owe you wifi either. Accept that your childhood experience wasn't his, and do better.", "It's none of your business or Theresa's, and while I appreciate the fact that both of you care about your loved ones, this is something to sort out between Caleb and your mom. The last fact would be good to mention to Theresa though. Additionally, if something as simple as a birthday reminder (which is a very common thing, and people generally just use it to plan a party or smth) triggers your mom, she needs therapy. I'm not really sure if I can pass a judgement here, but if I had to, it'd be either NAH or ESH.", "ESH. Theresa should really let it go at this point, as another poster said, she isn't giving the mom a chance to remember on her own. OP, you didn't need to stick your beak in.

His experience isn\u2019t invalid because you and some other siblings had a different experience. \n\nCaleb did not \u201cabandon\u201d his family when he moved out. No child is responsible for paying for the raising of their siblings. That responsibility falls on the parents - and in the case of one parent being absent they are responsible for child support. It is NEVER a child\u2019s responsibility even when they reach adulthood - they did not make the choices that lead to their parents having too many children to afford. A child\u2019s responsibility when they become an adult is to become independent and meet their owns needs. Which is exactly what Caleb did. Holding him accountable for your mom\u2019s poor quality of life is inaccurate and unfair - she made choices that led to the life she is living. Caleb did not make those choices for her. \n\nTheresa is a supportive spouse. While it causes your mom pain, Theresa\u2019s allegiance is to her husband. The fact that your mom feels pain and guilt is a result of her reflecting on how she has raised Caleb. She would be more likely to either be mildly annoyed at Theresa, or go \u201chey thanks for the reminder! I was thinking of doing X\u2026\u201d or something. The fact that Theresa messages only a few days in advance shows that your mom has never attempted to make any plans with Caleb for his birthday, as this kind of thing is arranged more than a few days in advance.

I was thinking of X\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was not your business to brigade for your mom. This simply makes you a \u201cflying monkey\u201d if you know that term. Your mom chose to act like a martyr in front of you, and you are now brigading and involved yourself where you didn\u2019t belong. \n\nTheresa and Caleb have no reason to tolerate that, so the fact that they\u2019ve rescinded their offer to let you use their internet is your own fault.

Instead of taking her side, and attacking on her behalf like a pitbull, maybe you could sit down with both mom and Caleb at a latter point to learn more about their relationship.\n\n2. I understand you were conditioned in a manner that everyone must sacrifice for the family, this was the only way for your mom to stay alive with so many kids. However the rhetoric that Caleb abandoned your family when he was 18-19, is terrible wrong. \n\nYour mom herself might have asked the older siblings who could already fend for themselves to find housing elsewhere. Your sister who also lived somewhere else, decided to send money to mom from her salary, that was her perogative, not a must. \n\nCaleb moved out around 18, which means that even living with his gf, now wife, he had to bear a lot of costs. At 18 he did not have higher education and maybe have not even finished high school yet, so probably had to work really hard to pay rent and cover basic necessities. He helped your mom by not being her burden in the basement and another mouth to feed. He still helped, without sending money.\n\n3. Due to point 2, you feel so entitled to your brother\u2019s belongings and internet, that you went over and schooled his wife who loves him and looks out for him, and then got surprised of the consequence that you are not welcome there anymore.

Time to move on from their help.", "I'm very conflicted here. I can draw on some parallels from my own childhood. When I speak to my brothers who were 11 and 9 years older than me, we agree on one thing - my life as a child was vastly different from theirs. I am the youngest of 5, and grew up in the 60s and 70s, as a child. My brothers grew up in the 50s and 60s. My parents were 19 when my oldest brother was born, and were 30 when I was born. Their experience and parenting changed dramatically as they learned how to be the best parents they could be. Don't get me wrong - my brothers never complained about being neglected, or forgotten. Nor did they have to work to \"help the family\", but my oldest brother did have to work his ass off to go to college. And we had no money for extras like vacations, new clothes, music lessons, or any type of lessons. What we did have was a lot of love, and a lot of laughter. But that doesn't mean what we all felt when my mother might forget something important to us, wasn't valid. I don't remember her forgetting a birthday for me, but she may have for the others. What I remember for all of us (as best as MY memory serves), is for our birthday, she let us pick what we wanted for dinner, she made a cake (from a box mix) and we got a present (nothing expensive). My parents, however, had a good marriage, and showed it to us. But mom ruled the roost. One thing she didn't do, was ask the older kids to be responsible for the younger ones. Yes, there was the occasional \"watch them while I run to the store\". But it ended there. My mother's attitude was, they're my children, I watch them and care for them. She let us all be kids. Now, I understand extenuating circumstances, but by the time your kids get to be in their late teens, you should have your life a bit more under control and not expect them to support you and the household. That being said, I feel that there are more details here that can be explained without more background. So, I guess I'm going with a weak ESH.

I too was out of my house by 15. \n\nMy sister grew up with a VERY different mother. My mom wasn\u2019t perfect with her but she TRIED and my mom and sister are very close.

My mom calls her when things are happening, I found out my mom had breast cancer after literally everyone else she knew and long after the biopsy - my sister knew from the beginning and was the reason my mom finally told me. \n\nIn addition because of how much younger than me my sister is, she was aware my mom and I had issues but she only really heard mom\u2019s perspective. Mom told her I ran away a lot, she knew there was probably more too it but that was all she was told. My sister and I are quite close and she knew I resented our mom and struggled with her but she was almost 30 before an offhand conversation had me realizing she didn\u2019t KNOW and telling her everything. \n\nShe told me she had no idea. I told her I knew she didn\u2019t know the depth but didn\u2019t realize she knew nothing and I\u2019m sorry I hadn\u2019t filled her in sooner.

Your mom can be sweet and amazing and loving to you (mine is to my sister) but be nothing but hurtful to your brother (mine is to me). And btw, if you talked to my mom she\u2019d say she never meant to hurt, she genuinely thought I\u2019d love those purses (I don\u2019t even own or carry ONE purse), she didn\u2019t mean anything, etc. when my grandaughter was born my mom said she wasn\u2019t coming to meet the baby which broke my sons heart (my son like my sister is very close to her) and when I called to yell at her she said \u201cYou guys don\u2019t want me there\u201d so she didn\u2019t come, literally no one said anything to imply that but in her mind she\u2019s the one being harmed and that\u2019s always been her story with me.\n\nYTA.

Caleb accepts this as his lot in life, we're poor, we can't afford a book for me. But then, his other sibling gets a 300 dollar gift. So we're poor and can't afford a 20 dollar book, but we can afford a 300 dollar purse for the child we actually care about (and never pulls any weight) Caleb thinks. To all the other siblings, nothing has happened, and this type of behaviour deeply wounds the person in a way they can't vocalize. \"Mom never gave a shit about me\" is the overall feeling, but every instance has melted away into dozens of situations like this. Mom forgot my birthday, but made me pay for Mike's cake. Mom takes Jimmy to soccer practice and encouraged him but forced me to drop soccer in order to babysit. Mom takes Sam out for a treat when she got an A but barely acknowledged my performance, and so on and so on.\n\nI'm not saying this is what happened, I'm just pointing out not all abuse is hitting your kid with a frying pan.

Him leaving would have meant it was easier to find a home to fit them all as well as probably paying less rent. They may have been put in temporary accommodation which is horrible and he Would have been separated as a male adult and not placed on the women\u2019s and family unit. Honestly why should he suffer. He is still close with everyone. He lost everything as well and would have needed his earnings to pay rent and buy himself the bare basics of what he needs to live and lost.\n\nAs for rent my mum demanded I continue paying rent to her even when I moved out. She didn\u2019t care it wasn\u2019t my responsibility and I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford my own rent. Not to add she told me every day of my childhood and lived there she hated me and hated I lived there. That even out of my adult siblings that worked and lived still at home it was only me she took half my wages off for rent. Sorry but if I\u2019m not living there then your better off as your Bills are smaller, less electricity and no food. Not going to happen.\n\nOp\u2019s mum choose to have so many kids that\u2019s on her and her children shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for finacially supporting their mother and raising their siblings for the rest of their lives. Especially as it seems she never financially nor emotionally supported them well but thinks as she choose to birth them she has a meal ticket in them. They should not have to live hand to mouth to support someone who selfishly chose this and decided she doesn\u2019t need to provide for her and kids future as she can leach from them. Why should he continue to live with them at that point and why was it wrong for him to have his own life. Saying he\u2019s from a large family so has to sacrifice his life possibly to be her unpaid babysitter/parent  meal ticket is wrong.\n\nI\u2019m positive with the age difference there is far more to the story that op either does not know or is deliberately leaving out. There is no way his mum would get so emotional all these years later saying she was a terrible mum just for one birthday. Nor Would Sil be doing everything to make sure she treats her son better. I wonder if it was her that told her son to find somewhere else to live so she had one less person to worry about. Something doesn\u2019t add up and the son\u2019s, Sil and mothers reaction shows she did far more crap than op has posted. Like most posters they try and only show the post in the light they want to make them seem right. I\u2019m living proof that parents can treat one child far differently that they others. So op can not judge things bast on their up bringing, on little to no facts and that he couldn\u2019t continue to financially contribute when he did not live there. No one must pay their parents rent and bills with no exception or choice for life.", "I mean, what was he supposed to do? Stay and take care of his younger siblings forever?

Theresa needs to F off.\n\nAnd let's not forget about Caleb refusing to let OP use his internet, which OP needs for school work, because OP was mean to poor widdle Theresa by calling her out on her annual BS.

Bro was 21 and had no legal obligation. Fascinating that only goes one way in the relationship to you. Mom has no obligation to her legally adult son, either.
