Caleb is the thirdest oldest in my family, counting half siblings, I am the ninth. Growing up, our tyrannical father left when we were young, and my mom was barely able to keep a roof over our heads. Apparently, many times before the incident I'm about to explain she \"forgot\" Caleb, but I don't remember any of those and some of my other siblings deny that and have specific memories that show the opposite. \n\nWhen I was 15 our house burnt down and Caleb moved in with his girlfriend (now wife). A few months later was his birthday, and our mom forgot to call him (keep in mind he abandoned our family and didn't help her with bills at all from his job like my other siblings were). She was literally living in her oldest child's basement while taking care of six underage children. My SIL, Theresa, has never let her forget it. \n\nI didn't even know this was happening until last  year, but for the past decade, Theresa has unfailingly texted my mom a few days beforehand to remind her of Caleb's birthday. Every time this brings my mom so much heartbreak and feelings of guilt, and brings her back to extremely traumatic and triggering times in her life. I only found out last year because she got the text when I was with her and she started crying. \n\nOnce again this year I was with her when she got the text. She literally started sobbing and apologizing to me, asking if she was truly such a terrible mom, etc. I of course told her no, she was an amazing mom to me. I felt like this has gotten ridiculous. Then I got on my phone and called Theresa and told her she needs to stop doing this. Theresa got mad at me and started saying my mom was x,y,z and she was trying to keep Caleb from being hurt. I asked her to explain to me one way Caleb had been hurt recently and she kept saying there were things that were none of my business. There was only one example she gave of a childhood neighbor dying and my mom not telling him, which was a lie because my mom had forwarded him all the church emails. He also hadn't talked to this person in years. \n\nWell then today I go over to Caleb's house to pick up some stuff and he makes a big deal saying that I was mean to Theresa and that I can't come around for a while. I explained the situation and how upset mom was and he said it didn't matter. This really hurts me because I use their house to get internet in order to do my college work which will be starting soon. So now he's punishing me for Theresas allegations about my mom. I would also point out Theresa has never given my mom a chance to prove she remembers, so it's a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689759895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153qcfv/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_stop_reminding_my_mom/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or that there are things between your mom and Caleb that you aren't aware of? \n\nI also find it a huge stretch to say he abandoned your family after the fire - if anything, he created more space in the basement for your mom and her 6 underage children. He might not have been able to financially contribute, and even if he was, he's not obligated to do so just because your mom had a large amount of kids to feed and take care of.", "YTA. You come six siblings after Caleb which means you probably have no idea what growing up was like for him. It's really weird that you think he should have been helping with bills at 15 when he was still a child. It sounds like your SIL is trying to protect her husband who experienced some neglect as a child, if your mom carries a lot of guilt about that time maybe she should address that in therapy.", "Meh this one is tough and can. I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here. Theresa is just trying to help your brother and you are trying to help your mom. Ultimately this whole situation is between your brother and your mom. You should stay out of it. Your brother is telling you as much by setting boundaries. You will be the AH if you keep inserting yourself. Theresa should stay out of it too IMO.", "Are you more upset about the birthday or losing your wifi.", "I lean towards YTA. \n\nPart of growing up is understanding that your siblings can have a very different understanding of your childhood than you do, and just because you experienced your parents one way does not mean your siblings got the same parent. \n\nYour brother was 18. Him moving out and not contributing towards bills isn\u2019t him abandoning the family - is that the narrative and tone your family normally uses when discussing Caleb? It\u2019s not abnormal for 18 year olds to move out, and while it would have been nice for him to pitch in, it definitely shouldn\u2019t have been the expectation. \n\nYour mom had a lot on her plate - that\u2019s understandable and I think Theresa should cut her more slack. But if your brother felt neglected and he was very clearly experiencing a lot of judgment from your family based on how you frame him moving out - Theresa had to support him and pick up the pieces through that. I\u2019m not surprised she doesn\u2019t trust your family to be gentle and considerate of your brother\u2019s feelings when you seem to be continually dismissive or judgmental of his experience of his childhood (he says mom forgot his birthday several times but you can\u2019t remember that so it didn\u2019t happen, you say him moving out at 18 was abandoning the family). \n\nYour approach to this wasn\u2019t great either. You shouldn\u2019t have confronted Theresa over it. You could talk to your brother and tell him how this is impacting mom, but you also need to be compassionate towards what his experience was.", "YTA. Regardless of why it happened your mother was neglectful. Your brother now has people in his life who love him and they are  protecting his feelings,", "YTA for interfering in the business of two grown women. I know you were trying to protect your mom, but that's not your job. Getting confrontational with your SIL has only added more fuel to the fire.", "YTA, you are blaming Caleb for your mom's failures.  She should feel bad. I'm glad she has a conscience.", "NTA.\nThey are acting like babies. The past is in the past. You should move on, not trying to make someone miserable over a little thing. You did good taking your moms side. You Better cut ties with them because they are not giving a sh*t about your struggle.", "NTA.  It seems Theresa doesn't care if she hurts your mom, as Theresa thinks your mom deserves to be punished.   But raising that many kids without help?  She's lucky she survived with most of her sanity intact.  So Theresa needs to cut mom some slack.", "NTA for asking your SIL to stop harassing your mum but I'm going to say N A H for the rest. I think your mum did the best she could under the circumstances and I've no doubt that she's an amazing woman. That said, this probably isn't just about her forgetting Caleb's birthday. Even if your mum did her best, there's probably some \"neglect\" (I can't think of a better word) that Caleb feels that he's discussed with his wife and she's trying to make sure that he doesn't feel like that again. Your SIL needs to leave your mum alone though.", "NTA.   \nTheresa is taking this too far, she is thinking only of Caleb, not of the rest of your family. And she\u2019s defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong, or because she\u2019s fixed thinking/pig headed/stubborn and can\u2019t see the damage this might be causing your mum even when it\u2019s pointed out.   \n\n\nDon\u2019t talk to Theresa in future, only to Caleb. Tell Caleb how your mum feels to get these texts and ask him to resolve it - that you know he was so very obviously oh so very very hurt when she forgot his birthday, but the wider context was\u2026 and that you hope that Caleb and your mum can solve this because it hurts you to see both of them so hurt with each other that Caleb has his wife texting her year on year about this. That should sort it. I suspect Caleb is annoyed but has no idea your mother cries every year about these texts, and that his wife knows this (and is being a real bitch it keep it up knowing it)\u2026 if it continues then Caleb is putting a line in the sand about it, and you can withdraw contact / assume he\u2019s a pig headed person and decide you can\u2019t fix pig headed ness/have a better life without his stupidity. \n\n  \nYou should find a new source of internet. It sounds like you are living still in serious poverty - can you approach your college and see if there\u2019s some kind of super low income bursary for internet or similar, or plan to study somewhere with free wifi (public library?)?", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I agree your brother has some unresolved issues with his childhood and your mom and he should seek therapy to sort it out.", "Well maybe Caleb has triggers and suffers too. If a child has a birthday forgotten many times it hurts.  His wife is on his side.
