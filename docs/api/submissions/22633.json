Or that there are things between your mom and Caleb that you aren't aware of?\n\nI also find it a huge stretch to say he abandoned your family after the fire - if anything, he created more space in the basement for your mom and her 6 underage children. He might not have been able to financially contribute, and even if he was, he's not obligated to do so just because your mom had a large amount of kids to feed and take care of.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA. You come six siblings after Caleb which means you probably have no idea what growing up was like for him. It's really weird that you think he should have been helping with bills at 15 when he was still a child. It sounds like your SIL is trying to protect her husband who experienced some neglect as a child, if your mom carries a lot of guilt about that time maybe she should address that in therapy.", "Meh this one is tough. I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here. Theresa is just trying to help your brother and you are trying to help your mom. Ultimately this whole situation is between your brother and your mom. You should stay out of it. Your brother is telling you as much by setting boundaries. You will be the AH if you keep inserting yourself. Theresa should stay out of it too IMO.\n\nEdit for grammar errors.", "Are you more upset about the birthday or losing your wifi.", "I lean towards YTA. \n\nPart of growing up is understanding that your siblings can have a very different understanding of your childhood than you do, and just because you experienced your parents one way does not mean your siblings got the same parent. \n\nYour brother was 18. Him moving out and not contributing towards bills isn\u2019t him abandoning the family - is that the narrative and tone your family normally uses when discussing Caleb? It\u2019s not abnormal for 18 year olds to move out, and while it would have been nice for him to pitch in, it definitely shouldn\u2019t have been the expectation. \n\nYour mom had a lot on her plate - that\u2019s understandable and I think Theresa should cut her more slack. But if your brother felt neglected and he was very clearly experiencing a lot of judgment from your family based on how you frame him moving out - Theresa had to support him and pick up the pieces through that. I\u2019m not surprised she doesn\u2019t trust your family to be gentle and considerate of your brother\u2019s feelings when you seem to be continually dismissive or judgmental of his experience of his childhood (he says mom forgot his birthday several times but you can\u2019t remember that so it didn\u2019t happen, you say him moving out at 18 was abandoning the family). \n\nYour approach to this wasn\u2019t great either. You shouldn\u2019t have confronted Theresa over it. You could talk to your brother and tell him how this is impacting mom, but you also need to be compassionate towards what his experience was.", "YTA.

I'm glad she has a conscience.", "NTA.\nThey are acting like babies. The past is in the past. You should move on, not trying to make someone miserable over a little thing. You did good taking your moms side. You Better cut ties with them because they are not giving a sh*t about your struggle.", "NTA.  It seems Theresa doesn't care if she hurts your mom, as Theresa thinks your mom deserves to be punished.   But raising that many kids without help?  She's lucky she survived with most of her sanity intact.  So Theresa needs to cut mom some slack.", "NTA for asking your SIL to stop harassing your mum but I'm going to say N A H for the rest. I think your mum did the best she could under the circumstances and I've no doubt that she's an amazing woman. That said, this probably isn't just about her forgetting Caleb's birthday. Even if your mum did her best, there's probably some \"neglect\" (I can't think of a better word) that Caleb feels that he's discussed with his wife and she's trying to make sure that he doesn't feel like that again. Your SIL needs to leave your mum alone though.", "NTA.   \nTheresa is taking this too far, she is thinking only of Caleb, not of the rest of your family. And she\u2019s defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong, or because she\u2019s fixed thinking/pig headed/stubborn and can\u2019t see the damage this might be causing your mum even when it\u2019s pointed out.   \n\n\nDon\u2019t talk to Theresa in future, only to Caleb. Tell Caleb how your mum feels to get these texts and ask him to resolve it - that you know he was so very obviously oh so very very hurt when she forgot his birthday, but the wider context was\u2026 and that you hope that Caleb and your mum can solve this because it hurts you to see both of them so hurt with each other that Caleb has his wife texting her year on year about this. That should sort it. I suspect Caleb is annoyed but has no idea your mother cries every year about these texts, and that his wife knows this (and is being a real bitch it keep it up knowing it)\u2026 if it continues then Caleb is putting a line in the sand about it, and you can withdraw contact / assume he\u2019s a pig headed person and decide you can\u2019t fix pig headed ness/have a better life without his stupidity. \n\n  \nYou should find a new source of internet.

If you were 10 years older I\u2019d say Y T A but I think you are early 20s and still growing up. You could all do with some therapy. If you are 30 then I\u2019d be saying YTA.", "Yta but based on your replies to other comments I doubt you will be able to understand that.", "I maybe get downvoted but I think the only real AH here is the father. \n\nYes the mum is wrong for causing her son to feeling neglected, BUT it was not done on purpose. Because their father abandoned their family:\n1. The mum is now a single mum to a bunch of kids (some that aren\u2019t even her own). \n2.Mum now has no financial stability and has to work two jobs just to keep her children fed, clothes, warm and housed.\n3. Because mum is working every free minute to provide for her children she is unable provide the emotional support for her children. \n\nWhile yes it is her job to emotionally support her children, she is carrying the load of two people. It\u2019s a very hard job that doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit. Obviously, Caleb won\u2019t understand this as a child. All he knows is that his dads left and his mum is never around. Of course, he\u2019s going to feel neglected. \nNone of you deserved the situation you were put into. \n\nSo let\u2019s place the blame on the right person, the deadbeat dad. \n\nOP your mum and brother may benefit from having a sit down and have a honest discussion about his childhood and her experience as a single mum so they can understand each others point of view. \n\nOP while you\u2019re not the AH for wanting to protect your mum, you cannot minimise your brothers experiences. He will be feeling abandoned by both parents and you need to recognise that. \n\nAlso OP you should really lay off Theresa, she\u2019s sticking up for her husband who is obviously dealing with a lot of painful emotions. The only side of your mother see\u2019s seen is your brothers perspective.", "Info: You keep mentioning the birthday reminder, but you never made any mention of the wording.

I would explain more but your more pressing issue needs to be upping your mother's quality of life. She clearly cared for you all and a simple birthday reminder that most would look at as a chance to help schedule a dinner or something is causing a breakdown means she needs help. \n\nIf your mother is constantly getting triggered by things as simple as a reminder of someone's birthday which is fairly common in many families to do, she needs therapy. Hell having that bad of an experience as a single mother she needs it regardless. \n\nCrying over a birthday reminder isn't the cause of your mother's crying, it is a very tiny straw that broke the camels back, and the underlying issues need addressed.", "YTA completely. \n\nCaleb\u2019s relationship with his mother and his wife are none of your business.

She woke up crying because in the dream she sent me to school and it was a normal day for me and she felt so guilty. She still will randomly bring up how horrible it made her feel and that was only a dream. Your mum isn't an AH for forgetting because she was suffering from PTSD and had days before been in a traumatic event and was then living in a basement with her children. She would be the AH if she had the same mentality as you, in that he abandoned you by not living in a basement with you all and paying her his wages. It is down to your mother to speak to her DIL and son. You are a big AH though for speaking of your brothers experiences as your own. They are not.

It\u2019s understandable you want to defend your mom but actions have consequences and if your brother now wants to limit contact that\u2019s his business.

Theresa may be taking this too far, but you were born down the line so have no idea what Caleb's childhood was like.", "YTA. \n\nI would bet serious money that you have - at BEST - a fraction of the story of Caleb's childhood   as well as the reasons why as to the dynamic between Caleb and your mother. \n\nIt's great that you feel your mom was an amazing one to you. It's unlikely that she was an amazing mom to all of your siblings, especially the older ones, given that many children and what you describe as far as finances, living conditions, her PTSD, etc. \n\nSome of the things you say sound like things your mom has spoon-fed you over the years to the point that you've internalized them as your own beliefs, such as framing an adult Caleb moving in with his girlfriend and not helping your mom out with bills as \"abandonment\" when it's simply a normal step in growing up. \n\nEverything you describe about Theresa reads - to me - as a protective spouse who is trying to prevent her husband from being further hurt by his family of origin while still remaining in some form of contact with them. \n\nThat your response to anything is to absolve your mother of any wrongdoing and demand Caleb \"justify\" his feelings by naming any recent hurts is further proof that Theresa is likely onto something here. \n\nCaleb doesn't owe you proof of anything, and he doesn't owe you wifi either. Accept that your childhood experience wasn't his, and do better.", "It's none of your business or Theresa's, and while I appreciate the fact that both of you care about your loved ones, this is something to sort out between Caleb and your mom. The last fact would be good to mention to Theresa though. Additionally, if something as simple as a birthday reminder (which is a very common thing, and people generally just use it to plan a party or smth) triggers your mom, she needs therapy. I'm not really sure if I can pass a judgement here, but if I had to, it'd be either NAH or ESH.", "ESH. Theresa should really let it go at this point, as another poster said, she isn't giving the mom a chance to remember on her own. OP, you didn't need to stick your beak in.

His experience isn\u2019t invalid because you and some other siblings had a different experience. \n\nCaleb did not \u201cabandon\u201d his family when he moved out. No child is responsible for paying for the raising of their siblings. That responsibility falls on the parents - and in the case of one parent being absent they are responsible for child support. It is NEVER a child\u2019s responsibility even when they reach adulthood - they did not make the choices that lead to their parents having too many children to afford. A child\u2019s responsibility when they become an adult is to become independent and meet their owns needs. Which is exactly what Caleb did. Holding him accountable for your mom\u2019s poor quality of life is inaccurate and unfair - she made choices that led to the life she is living. Caleb did not make those choices for her. \n\nTheresa is a supportive spouse. While it causes your mom pain, Theresa\u2019s allegiance is to her husband. The fact that your mom feels pain and guilt is a result of her reflecting on how she has raised Caleb. She would be more likely to either be mildly annoyed at Theresa, or go \u201chey thanks for the reminder! I was thinking of doing X\u2026\u201d or something. The fact that Theresa messages only a few days in advance shows that your mom has never attempted to make any plans with Caleb for his birthday, as this kind of thing is arranged more than a few days in advance.

I was thinking of X\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was not your business to brigade for your mom. This simply makes you a \u201cflying monkey\u201d if you know that term. Your mom chose to act like a martyr in front of you, and you are now brigading and involved yourself where you didn\u2019t belong. \n\nTheresa and Caleb have no reason to tolerate that, so the fact that they\u2019ve rescinded their offer to let you use their internet is your own fault.

Instead of taking her side, and attacking on her behalf like a pitbull, maybe you could sit down with both mom and Caleb at a latter point to learn more about their relationship.\n\n2. I understand you were conditioned in a manner that everyone must sacrifice for the family, this was the only way for your mom to stay alive with so many kids. However the rhetoric that Caleb abandoned your family when he was 18-19, is terrible wrong. \n\nYour mom herself might have asked the older siblings who could already fend for themselves to find housing elsewhere. Your sister who also lived somewhere else, decided to send money to mom from her salary, that was her perogative, not a must. \n\nCaleb moved out around 18, which means that even living with his gf, now wife, he had to bear a lot of costs. At 18 he did not have higher education and maybe have not even finished high school yet, so probably had to work really hard to pay rent and cover basic necessities. He helped your mom by not being her burden in the basement and another mouth to feed. He still helped, without sending money.\n\n3. Due to point 2, you feel so entitled to your brother\u2019s belongings and internet, that you went over and schooled his wife who loves him and looks out for him, and then got surprised of the consequence that you are not welcome there anymore.

Time to move on from their help.", "I'm very conflicted here. I can draw on some parallels from my own childhood. When I speak to my brothers who were 11 and 9 years older than me, we agree on one thing - my life as a child was vastly different from theirs. I am the youngest of 5, and grew up in the 60s and 70s, as a child. My brothers grew up in the 50s and 60s. My parents were 19 when my oldest brother was born, and were 30 when I was born. Their experience and parenting changed dramatically as they learned how to be the best parents they could be. Don't get me wrong - my brothers never complained about being neglected, or forgotten. Nor did they have to work to \"help the family\", but my oldest brother did have to work his ass off to go to college. And we had no money for extras like vacations, new clothes, music lessons, or any type of lessons. What we did have was a lot of love, and a lot of laughter. But that doesn't mean what we all felt when my mother might forget something important to us, wasn't valid. I don't remember her forgetting a birthday for me, but she may have for the others. What I remember for all of us (as best as MY memory serves), is for our birthday, she let us pick what we wanted for dinner, she made a cake (from a box mix) and we got a present (nothing expensive). My parents, however, had a good marriage, and showed it to us. But mom ruled the roost. One thing she didn't do, was ask the older kids to be responsible for the younger ones. Yes, there was the occasional \"watch them while I run to the store\". But it ended there. My mother's attitude was, they're my children, I watch them and care for them. She let us all be kids. Now, I understand extenuating circumstances, but by the time your kids get to be in their late teens, you should have your life a bit more under control and not expect them to support you and the household. That being said, I feel that there are more details here that can be explained without more background. So, I guess I'm going with a weak ESH.

I too was out of my house by 15. \n\nMy sister grew up with a VERY different mother. My mom wasn\u2019t perfect with her but she TRIED and my mom and sister are very close.

My mom calls her when things are happening, I found out my mom had breast cancer after literally everyone else she knew and long after the biopsy - my sister knew from the beginning and was the reason my mom finally told me. \n\nIn addition because of how much younger than me my sister is, she was aware my mom and I had issues but she only really heard mom\u2019s perspective. Mom told her I ran away a lot, she knew there was probably more too it but that was all she was told. My sister and I are quite close and she knew I resented our mom and struggled with her but she was almost 30 before an offhand conversation had me realizing she didn\u2019t KNOW and telling her everything. \n\nShe told me she had no idea. I told her I knew she didn\u2019t know the depth but didn\u2019t realize she knew nothing and I\u2019m sorry I hadn\u2019t filled her in sooner.

Your mom can be sweet and amazing and loving to you (mine is to my sister) but be nothing but hurtful to your brother (mine is to me). And btw, if you talked to my mom she\u2019d say she never meant to hurt, she genuinely thought I\u2019d love those purses (I don\u2019t even own or carry ONE purse), she didn\u2019t mean anything, etc. when my grandaughter was born my mom said she wasn\u2019t coming to meet the baby which broke my sons heart (my son like my sister is very close to her) and when I called to yell at her she said \u201cYou guys don\u2019t want me there\u201d so she didn\u2019t come, literally no one said anything to imply that but in her mind she\u2019s the one being harmed and that\u2019s always been her story with me.\n\nYTA.

Caleb accepts this as his lot in life, we're poor, we can't afford a book for me. But then, his other sibling gets a 300 dollar gift. So we're poor and can't afford a 20 dollar book, but we can afford a 300 dollar purse for the child we actually care about (and never pulls any weight) Caleb thinks. To all the other siblings, nothing has happened, and this type of behaviour deeply wounds the person in a way they can't vocalize. \"Mom never gave a shit about me\" is the overall feeling, but every instance has melted away into dozens of situations like this. Mom forgot my birthday, but made me pay for Mike's cake. Mom takes Jimmy to soccer practice and encouraged him but forced me to drop soccer in order to babysit. Mom takes Sam out for a treat when she got an A but barely acknowledged my performance, and so on and so on.\n\nI'm not saying this is what happened, I'm just pointing out not all abuse is hitting your kid with a frying pan.

And them there is don\u2019t be a jerk and forget my wonderful Caleb\u2019s special day like you did that one time", "But the impression I get is there\u2019s a lot more that is eating her brother up then just mom forgetting one birthday. Sounds like mother parentified this kid and didn\u2019t treat him fairly.", "I am not judging the wife. Her dynamic with the mom isn't being discussed here. Unless you're saying that just because the wife is an AH, that gives license to the daughter to be an AH too? \n\nThat logic doesn't float with me, sorry.", "Or could have been \"Welp, we lost our house and the last thing mom needs right now is to figure out how to house and feed one more person when I can just move in with GF and be self-sufficient\"", "Actually it would be beneficial for him to move out at that point as it would be harder to find such a large home to accommodate everyone. Him leaving would have meant it was easier to find a home to fit them all as well as probably paying less rent. They may have been put in temporary accommodation which is horrible and he Would have been separated as a male adult and not placed on the women\u2019s and family unit. Honestly why should he suffer. He is still close with everyone. He lost everything as well and would have needed his earnings to pay rent and buy himself the bare basics of what he needs to live and lost.\n\nAs for rent my mum demanded I continue paying rent to her even when I moved out. She didn\u2019t care it wasn\u2019t my responsibility and I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford my own rent. Not to add she told me every day of my childhood and lived there she hated me and hated I lived there. That even out of my adult siblings that worked and lived still at home it was only me she took half my wages off for rent. Sorry but if I\u2019m not living there then your better off as your Bills are smaller, less electricity and no food. Not going to happen.\n\nOp\u2019s mum choose to have so many kids that\u2019s on her and her children shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for finacially supporting their mother and raising their siblings for the rest of their lives. Especially as it seems she never financially nor emotionally supported them well but thinks as she choose to birth them she has a meal ticket in them. They should not have to live hand to mouth to support someone who selfishly chose this and decided she doesn\u2019t need to provide for her and kids future as she can leach from them. Why should he continue to live with them at that point and why was it wrong for him to have his own life. Saying he\u2019s from a large family so has to sacrifice his life possibly to be her unpaid babysitter/parent  meal ticket is wrong.\n\nI\u2019m positive with the age difference there is far more to the story that op either does not know or is deliberately leaving out. There is no way his mum would get so emotional all these years later saying she was a terrible mum just for one birthday. Nor Would Sil be doing everything to make sure she treats her son better. I wonder if it was her that told her son to find somewhere else to live so she had one less person to worry about. Something doesn\u2019t add up and the son\u2019s, Sil and mothers reaction shows she did far more crap than op has posted. Like most posters they try and only show the post in the light they want to make them seem right. I\u2019m living proof that parents can treat one child far differently that they others. So op can not judge things bast on their up bringing, on little to no facts and that he couldn\u2019t continue to financially contribute when he did not live there. No one must pay their parents rent and bills with no exception or choice for life.", "I mean, what was he supposed to do? Stay and take care of his younger siblings forever? Garnish his paycheck for his mother who had six kids past him, that clearly she wasn\u2019t equipped to handle if she was being financed by his older siblings? Never move on?", "Wait, I thought Caleb left at age 15? That\u2019s not the same.", "Right which is why I said that. Just because you live with someone doesn\u2019t mean they see/know what\u2019s going on with everything. I\u2019m saying he was open with her at that time about the fact that she forgot and allowed her to see the impact of that. I\u2019m saying that she was the one dealing with the fallout of him being forgotten.", "I can totally see this. She had all those kids and no home so she handled things triage style. He had a safe home so she focused energy elsewhere. I would bet Caleb was rarely the squeaky wheel and, in turn, rarely got oiled.", "I honestly don\u2019t disagree but I can imagine a scenario where Caleb feels slighted in many other ways and this is the one the wife can mitigate. The whole notification about the dead neighbor thing was weird and I think Caleb now keeps a running tally of ways he\u2019s sidelined so Theresa has honed in on the one she can fix.", "Thank for this comment. \n\nTheir house and everything they own went up in flames. It can\u2019t be easy living in your adult child\u2019s basement with 6 kids that are dependent on you. I\u2019m sure she was under tremendous stress and quite frankly she had more important things to think about like finding a roof over their heads, where their next meal is coming from, and how she\u2019ll clothe her kids. I don\u2019t think mom forgot on purpose. \n\nCalling for 10 years straight feels more like Theresa  putting her MIL in her place just because she forgot that one time. Caleb and Theresa are never going to let his poor mother live that down and will always hang it over her head. It would\u2019ve be interesting to know if OP and Caleb\u2019s father calls him on his birthday. If he doesn\u2019t call I wonder if Theresa and Caleb are as hard on him as they are on his mother.", "But it hits a little different when an occasion like that it's forgotten by your mother... The one person left to protect you after your father abandoned his duty to show you how to be a real, thoughtful man. Your mother is the only one left to show you how to be thoughtful with your actions and when she isn't it it stings. I'm grateful that I have an awesome mother who rose to the occasion of being a compassionate father as much as she could when my father and later, stepfather, couldn't uphold their end of the bargain... But, I can truly empathize with people who weren't blessed with that magnificent gift.", "Sure if the slights aren\u2019t still occurring.", "No the post just says he lived there. Do you know how many men (people in general) will downplay their disappointment or just shut down rather than be openly emotional when they feel slighted. Just virtue of Theresa being in the same house does not mean she had to pick up the pieces.", "Good assumption to make I guess", "No. The mom was in a massive crisis and was dealing with 6 minor children. Her forgetting one time a decade ago isn\u2019t something they need to keep making her feel bad about.", "SIL provided one that wasn\u2019t true and claimed there were other examples but she couldn\u2019t talk about them because she hadn\u2019t made them up yet.", "And OP says that specific example was a lie", "Too private to share...as in haven't thought up a good enough lie", "Right...because the house bound mother, with no income, was the one in the relationship to choose to be oppressed and have multiple babies and then be abandoned? Get over yourself.", "Probably because Theresa keeps making a big deal about it and constantly bringing it up.", "Because the mom apparently forgot ONCE, years ago after a tragic incident. The mom gets no chance to prove it was a one off and every year she is reminded of one of the most traumatic times of her life. That's cruel.", "It's a little weird for a spouse to remind their in-laws that it's the in-law's child's birthday. Or maybe I grew up with a different family experience. But the only birthday reminders ive ever seen (and I mean reminders, not invitations or smth) have been to extended family for their own young child, or a reminder about an event. It very much sounds like, or at the LEAST everyone's interpreting it as, she's only doing this because of that one time mom forgot, which is very passive aggressive Which, if it wasn't the case, why wouldn't she deny it when OP confronted her?", "Took responsibility for her actions of forgetting her adult son\u2019s birthday one time after their house burned down and she had 6 minor kids to deal with? It sounds like she has taken plenty of responsibility.", "We have no idea how their relationship is now and from the mom's reaction it's clear this incident still greatly upsets her.", "How does her breaking into tears every time she gets the text tell you that she doesn\u2019t feel horrible about her mistake? If she hasn\u2019t apologized for it, I understand being on edge every year, but I\u2019d at least give her a shot. She\u2019s essentially being robbed of the chance to prove she\u2019s changed every single year. It must be soul-crushing", "Forgetting her adult son\u2019s birthday right then isn\u2019t neglectful. He needs to grow the fuck up.", "How do you know that? OP didn't mention whether she has or not.", "OP said Caleb *says* it was not the first time, but other siblings have memories that contradict this", "But your own logic would dictate the wife to be an asshole. \n\nAnd honestly it absolutely should matter. Tell me. If someone was putting your mother in a bad place. Year after year. And being an asshole about it. Would you not interfere??? Cuz I fucking would. Even if it was my brother doing it. Or his wife. Berating someone for a mistake 10 years ago year after year is stupid and I would tell the person to fuck off as well. Hell. Wouldn't even have to be my mother lol. A good friend and id do it. \n\nWhat situation would it take for you to stick up for someone?", "No but help his family get back on his feet would be the right thing to do", "OP was 15 when Caleb left. Caleb is several siblings ahead, so probably 18+ at the time", "OP (the 9th kid) was 15 when Caleb (the 3rd kid) moved out. Doing the math, Caleb would have been in his 20\u2019s.", "OP was 15. Caleb was older and likely over 18.", ">I would bet money that Theresa was there and saw firsthand...\n\nThat sounded to me like you weren't sure Theresa was there and I wanted to make sure you knew she was. Seems like we were on the same page all along", ">triage style\n\nThis is exactly it. The wife needs to chill, and I'm sorry for Caleb, but his mom is only human. Frickin six kids and a house that just burnt down? Sorry I'm forgetting more than just a birthday.", "Caleb probably felt pushed out of the home/family when they lost their house in the fire.  It sounds like he decided to help by supporting himself so his mom could focus on the little kids and OP and mom resented him for not doing more for them when he was young and just moved out.", "She forgot his birthday a few months AFTER HER HOUSE BURNED DOWN. I don't doubt that there are other issues...with 9 children, there had to have been neglect at the very least, but the fact that the one forgotten birthday (in a traumatic year, when he was already an adult) is the thing his wife harps on year after year is pretty telling to me. She can be a supportive wife while letting him be the one to be petty, if he wants to be.", "Well I can\u2019t think of why she\u2019d have a breakdown if it\u2019s a simple hay Caleb\u2019s bday is Friday. I\u2019ve said something similar to my husband regarding his dad. Like hay call your dad it\u2019s his bday (I only remember bdays cause I put them in my calendar app).", "OP mentioned that Caleb has been forgotten many times.", "Honestly, SIL doesn't need to make anything up. She's seeing her husband being sad over forgotten bdays and other things, probably related to treating younger siblings better than him (probably why they don't want to share with op). Also, how does op know mom forwarded the emails of Caleb's friends death? How does op know that Caleb supposedly didn't talk to this person anymore?  The sister-in-law is sending one text a year to remind Mom about a birthday. Mom breaking into tears is something she needs to deal with on her own, getting a reminder isn't inherently bad. If I was the sister-in-law, I'd be reminding my mother-in-law as well.", "Op is claiming Caleb didn't keep in touch with the neighbour and he got forwarded church emails. Did OP see these emails? Also how would op know that Caleb didn't keep in touch with this neighbour? Op sounds like a liar to me.", "I know that my mother-in-law cries at the drop of a hat, and there are a lot of things my husband can't bring up with her. She's a very nice woman but there are things that she did that hurt my husband, and if other people had asked what those details were, I wouldn't share with them because it's none of their business, that includes his adopted family members. That doesn't make it a lie. It's pretty obvious that OP is biased and getting info from mom ie the party that has done the hurtful things to Caleb. Getting one text a year is not overkill to make sure that someone's birthday isn't forgotten. Crying over one single text reminding you of a birthday is kind of unhinged though.", "Being reminded of one missed birthday doesn't do this. You have to be extra dense to not see that this is the tip of the iceberg between mom and Caleb.", "It IS weird that the spouse should have to remind the MOTHER of her sons birthday. The wife should NEVER have felt it necessary, because what mother \"forgets\" their childs birthday? Regardless of what's going on, and I understand how tragic a house fire would be, a quick phone call wishing your CHILD a happy birthday really isn't much effort.", "She had 9 kids she obviously couldn\u2019t take care of. She parentified the older ones. That\u2019s a shitty parent.", "and it must be soul crushing for him to have to every year go through the same thing over and over again yk! just because she might have changed now, doesnt mean he\u2019s not allowed to feel hurt for the times she didn\u2019t change and she wasn\u2019t great yk! just because someone\u2019s trying now, doesn\u2019t erase all the times they just didn\u2019t try! \nand also people can use their tears to manipulate others! If she was truly sorry about it, she would make the effort to properly apologize, and to make up for it in a great way! it seems that hasn\u2019t happened", "I guarantee you that if I ask my siblings, they'll have no recollection of the fact that my twin and I (middle children) didn't get a birthday party after age 4 or so, while they all did.\n\nPeople often don't notice/recall things that don't directly affect them.", "I agree with you.  Theresa could be just punishing the mom under the guise of protecting her husband's feelings.  \n\nMy friend was a teenage mom, her son experienced a great deal of lack and insecurity with housing, food, school, etc. He is scarred, understandably so.  When he was 18, my friend married and had a daughter.  Her upbringing is night and day compared to her brother.  My friend has apologized over and over, but the son isn't healed yet (maybe never will be).  But, holy fucking hell, his wife has punished my friend for years. Bashes her to others, reminds her with wisecracks like \"nice car, daughter, hey husband, what kind of car did you get?\"   She shits on everything good my friend does, including how my friend spoils her grandchildren fucking rotten.  DIL will never let it go.\n\nETA: for 15 years, the son had always introduced my friend's husband as \"dad\", and still does.  DIL introduces him as stepfather, even though they've discussed how it's hurtful and asked her not to do that.  FFS, the sons life improved exponentially when my friend met her husband. DIL won't let it go.", ">\nWhat situation would it take for you to stick up for someone?\n\nSo it's okay to stick up for your mom but not your partner? Huh.", "If you did it, I'd say YTA.", "Okay, but said family doesn\u2019t have wifi at least 3 years later, which probably means they\u2019re still not in an entirely stable situation. So what, Caleb needs to put his life on hold indefinitely? He moved out and removed a mouth to feed from the equation.", "Got it!", "Theresa also resorted to name calling and fabricating stories making MIL look bad and hurting Caleb. That is not about a friendly reminder. Because if there was anything friendly about the reminder theresa wouldnt have gotten so aggressively defensive and blamed MIL and called her names. A decent person would have said oh im sorry i didnt realize i was upsetting her i just didnt want caleb to be upset. And let's not forget Caleb was an ADULT  when   the examples Theresa used to justify making MIL feel.like shit and badmouthing her. Again, I will \nPoint out Caleb was a grown ass man living with his mother when the fire happened and while his mother and sibs struggled he just blithely moved in with Theresa the witch and wrote a narrative of poor Caleb mommy forgot his bday. Poor Caleb's friend died and mommy didn't tell him. Nope I'm not buying Theresa and Caleb's pity party it's just an excuse to treat MIL like crap.", "I highly doubt it\u2019s just the birthday she\u2019s saying, but it\u2019s clear that she is stirring the pot.", "Girl it was one time\n\n>what mother \"forgets\" their child's birthday?\n\nThe kind with 9 kids and no partner that spends her days running around to make sure everyone survives?\n\nI don't think you do understand how tragic a house fire is, actually. They lost EVERYTHING. And for this family, they didn't have much to start with. Life becomes even busier than it was before, even more stressful as now you're worried about finding a new routine to get the kids to school, finding a new place to live, probably crashing on someone's couch or hemorrhaging money sleeping at a motel. She probably didn't know what day it was to begin with.", "The response to being hurt isn\u2019t to plan a decade long campaign of making them feel like an asshole. If he wants her to make an effort, he has to let her actually try. If he\u2019s not willing to give her a chance, that\u2019s fine, but being this intentionally hurtful seems really messed up.

No one benefits from what is happening.", "I don't see name-calling anywhere, and she is mentioning things her husband told her happened. So she isn't lying or name calling. Eta: also I see in a comment that he was around 18 yrs old when he moved out. He was a teenager and not at all responsible for sending money back but having your mom forget your 18th bday (cuz apparently op doesn't remember his exact age and it seems like that's what happened, woof, that is gross). Mom looks worse with ops comments. Op even admits Caleb didn't get as much attention as the younger siblings, and that's through ops rose tinted glasses. Mom looks worse every second.", "I'm not unsympathetic to the mother. She did have a lot going on. But her son was hurt. Accidentally or not. He was hurt. Enough that the wife feels she has to remind the mother yearly so that she doesn't hurt him again. You say it was only one time? One time was all it took. I don't think the SIL is doing anything wrong. She's just trying to protect her husband from getting hurt, and that's a great partner. \n\nAnd yes mate, I DO understand how tragic a house fire is.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. A lot of people delighting in this lady being treated with needless cruelty. Bro should get therapy as much as mom, and stop expecting his wife to punish his mom every year. Like is that not something a crazy person does? Even if she forgot all his birthdays, if he really cared he could bring it up to her himself"]}
