Or that there are things between your mom and Caleb that you aren't aware of? \n\nI also find it a huge stretch to say he abandoned your family after the fire - if anything, he created more space in the basement for your mom and her 6 underage children. He might not have been able to financially contribute, and even if he was, he's not obligated to do so just because your mom had a large amount of kids to feed and take care of.", "YTA. You come six siblings after Caleb which means you probably have no idea what growing up was like for him. It's really weird that you think he should have been helping with bills at 15 when he was still a child. It sounds like your SIL is trying to protect her husband who experienced some neglect as a child, if your mom carries a lot of guilt about that time maybe she should address that in therapy.", "Meh this one is tough and can. I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here. Theresa is just trying to help your brother and you are trying to help your mom. Ultimately this whole situation is between your brother and your mom. You should stay out of it. Your brother is telling you as much by setting boundaries. You will be the AH if you keep inserting yourself. Theresa should stay out of it too IMO.", "Are you more upset about the birthday or losing your wifi.", "I lean towards YTA. \n\nPart of growing up is understanding that your siblings can have a very different understanding of your childhood than you do, and just because you experienced your parents one way does not mean your siblings got the same parent. \n\nYour brother was 18. Him moving out and not contributing towards bills isn\u2019t him abandoning the family - is that the narrative and tone your family normally uses when discussing Caleb? It\u2019s not abnormal for 18 year olds to move out, and while it would have been nice for him to pitch in, it definitely shouldn\u2019t have been the expectation. \n\nYour mom had a lot on her plate - that\u2019s understandable and I think Theresa should cut her more slack. But if your brother felt neglected and he was very clearly experiencing a lot of judgment from your family based on how you frame him moving out - Theresa had to support him and pick up the pieces through that. I\u2019m not surprised she doesn\u2019t trust your family to be gentle and considerate of your brother\u2019s feelings when you seem to be continually dismissive or judgmental of his experience of his childhood (he says mom forgot his birthday several times but you can\u2019t remember that so it didn\u2019t happen, you say him moving out at 18 was abandoning the family). \n\nYour approach to this wasn\u2019t great either. You shouldn\u2019t have confronted Theresa over it. You could talk to your brother and tell him how this is impacting mom, but you also need to be compassionate towards what his experience was.", "YTA. Regardless of why it happened your mother was neglectful. Your brother now has people in his life who love him and they are  protecting his feelings,", "YTA for interfering in the business of two grown women. I know you were trying to protect your mom, but that's not your job.

I'm glad she has a conscience.", "NTA.\nThey are acting like babies. The past is in the past. You should move on, not trying to make someone miserable over a little thing. You did good taking your moms side. You Better cut ties with them because they are not giving a sh*t about your struggle.", "NTA.  It seems Theresa doesn't care if she hurts your mom, as Theresa thinks your mom deserves to be punished.   But raising that many kids without help?  She's lucky she survived with most of her sanity intact.  So Theresa needs to cut mom some slack.", "NTA for asking your SIL to stop harassing your mum but I'm going to say N A H for the rest. I think your mum did the best she could under the circumstances and I've no doubt that she's an amazing woman. That said, this probably isn't just about her forgetting Caleb's birthday. Even if your mum did her best, there's probably some \"neglect\" (I can't think of a better word) that Caleb feels that he's discussed with his wife and she's trying to make sure that he doesn't feel like that again. Your SIL needs to leave your mum alone though.", "NTA.   \nTheresa is taking this too far, she is thinking only of Caleb, not of the rest of your family. And she\u2019s defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong, or because she\u2019s fixed thinking/pig headed/stubborn and can\u2019t see the damage this might be causing your mum even when it\u2019s pointed out.   \n\n\nDon\u2019t talk to Theresa in future, only to Caleb. Tell Caleb how your mum feels to get these texts and ask him to resolve it - that you know he was so very obviously oh so very very hurt when she forgot his birthday, but the wider context was\u2026 and that you hope that Caleb and your mum can solve this because it hurts you to see both of them so hurt with each other that Caleb has his wife texting her year on year about this. That should sort it. I suspect Caleb is annoyed but has no idea your mother cries every year about these texts, and that his wife knows this (and is being a real bitch it keep it up knowing it)\u2026 if it continues then Caleb is putting a line in the sand about it, and you can withdraw contact / assume he\u2019s a pig headed person and decide you can\u2019t fix pig headed ness/have a better life without his stupidity. \n\n  \nYou should find a new source of internet. It sounds like you are living still in serious poverty - can you approach your college and see if there\u2019s some kind of super low income bursary for internet or similar, or plan to study somewhere with free wifi (public library?)?", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you were 10 years older I\u2019d say Y T A but I think you are early 20s and still growing up. You could all do with some therapy. If you are 30 then I\u2019d be saying YTA.", "Yta but based on your replies to other comments I doubt you will be able to understand that.", "I maybe get downvoted but I think the only real AH here is the father. \n\nYes the mum is wrong for causing her son to feeling neglected, BUT it was not done on purpose. Because their father abandoned their family:\n1. The mum is now a single mum to a bunch of kids (some that aren\u2019t even her own). \n2.Mum now has no financial stability and has to work two jobs just to keep her children fed, clothes, warm and housed.\n3. Because mum is working every free minute to provide for her children she is unable provide the emotional support for her children. \n\nWhile yes it is her job to emotionally support her children, she is carrying the load of two people. It\u2019s a very hard job that doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit. Obviously, Caleb won\u2019t understand this as a child. All he knows is that his dads left and his mum is never around. Of course, he\u2019s going to feel neglected. \nNone of you deserved the situation you were put into. \n\nSo let\u2019s place the blame on the right person, the deadbeat dad. \n\nOP your mum and brother may benefit from having a sit down and have a honest discussion about his childhood and her experience as a single mum so they can understand each others point of view. \n\nOP while you\u2019re not the AH for wanting to protect your mum, you cannot minimise your brothers experiences. He will be feeling abandoned by both parents and you need to recognise that. \n\nAlso OP you should really lay off Theresa, she\u2019s sticking up for her husband who is obviously dealing with a lot of painful emotions. The only side of your mother see\u2019s seen is your brothers perspective.", "Info: You keep mentioning the birthday reminder, but you never made any mention of the wording.

I would explain more but your more pressing issue needs to be upping your mother's quality of life. She clearly cared for you all and a simple birthday reminder that most would look at as a chance to help schedule a dinner or something is causing a breakdown means she needs help. \n\nIf your mother is constantly getting triggered by things as simple as a reminder of someone's birthday which is fairly common in many families to do, she needs therapy. Hell having that bad of an experience as a single mother she needs it regardless. \n\nCrying over a birthday reminder isn't the cause of your mother's crying, it is a very tiny straw that broke the camels back, and the underlying issues need addressed.", "YTA completely. \n\nCaleb\u2019s relationship with his mother and his wife are none of your business.

Also Theresa should just let your mom mess up all on her own and make her husband feel special in her own way.", "YTA. My mum had a dream once that she forgot my birthday, over 15 years ago. She woke up crying because in the dream she sent me to school and it was a normal day for me and she felt so guilty. She still will randomly bring up how horrible it made her feel and that was only a dream. Your mum isn't an AH for forgetting because she was suffering from PTSD and had days before been in a traumatic event and was then living in a basement with her children. She would be the AH if she had the same mentality as you, in that he abandoned you by not living in a basement with you all and paying her his wages. It is down to your mother to speak to her DIL and son. You are a big AH though for speaking of your brothers experiences as your own. They are not.

It\u2019s understandable you want to defend your mom but actions have consequences and if your brother now wants to limit contact that\u2019s his business.

A child\u2019s responsibility when they become an adult is to become independent and meet their owns needs. Which is exactly what Caleb did.

Caleb did not make those choices for her. \n\nTheresa is a supportive spouse. While it causes your mom pain, Theresa\u2019s allegiance is to her husband.

That only breaks her more, is that what they want out of this, see her suffer from guilt and ptsd?", "Yeah but Theresa is using the mothers guilt and trauma to punish her over and over again. She didn't even hide that she did that on purpose to make the mother feel bad.", "Parents are people and his mom just lost her house in a fire and had you get subs to look after both Caleb and sil need to grow up and understand people make mistakes and let it go. Stop beating the poor woman up.", "No. OP was 15. Read thoroughly before you try to emphasize a point.", "No he was NINETEEN.", "Might want to reread again. OP was fifteen at the time of the fire", "OP was 15, not his brother who was instead a few years older. Just flagging up", "Because it\u2019s every year and incredibly unnecessary and out of bounds at this point", "Or else mom is too cheap to pay for wifi and is still expecting her kids to contribute to raising their siblings.", "I don\u2019t consider an annual text reminder to be TORMENTING and if it is, mom needs to check herself in for a mental health evaluation", "It\u2019s not tormenting. Teresa is texting the mother every year to remind the mother to call Caleb for his birthday so Caleb isn\u2019t hurt by her forgetting.", ">did that on purpose to make the mother feel bad.\n\nI might just not be awake yet, but could you point out to me where you got that?", "Yeah there\u2019s a line here and I think everyone sucks in at least some part. OP clearly sucks, but  It\u2019s true - Theresa IS bludgeoning OP\u2019s mom over the head with her previous poor behavior and hasn\u2019t given her a chance to even demonstrate that she can text without a reminder. At some point, Theresa either needs to stop and give mom a chance or they need to simply limit contact. Continuously doing this because she knows it hurts OP\u2019s mom isn\u2019t productive and it\u2019s terrible for relationship.", ">Then I got on my phone and called Theresa and told her she needs to stop doing this. Theresa got mad at me and started saying my mom was x,y,z and she was trying to keep Caleb from being hurt.\n\nShe immediately knew what Op was talking about, so she knew what she was doing, didn't even feel sorry that the constant reminder of that one forgotten birthday in one of their most traumatic times is haunting her.", "I disagree, it\u2019s a birthday reminder. That\u2019s a pretty normal thing to give someone. If OP\u2019s mother is so triggered, then she needs some serious therapy to come to terms with how she failed Caleb.", "The point of her doing this wasn't to hurt the mother, from my perspective, she's just okay that her reminder hurts the mother in order to not hurt her husband, because she puts her husband and his feelings before the rest of the family's (which is the way it should be, in my opinion)", "Don't forget OP mum was going through literal fire, as in her house had just burned down and she had several underage children to care for and was reliant on another barely adult child for refuge. These messages are a reminder of what is probably the worst time in this woman's life. \n\nOP is TA for not understanding how much this time period impacted Caleb. Feeling like you've been abandoned and forgotten by your family is incredibly hard. OP however is in college by the sounds of it and thus young enough to get a pass of \"you're an idiot but you're young enough to learn\"\n\nSIL is TA for not letting it go. She is older now and, presumably wiser, and should be taking her lead from Caleb.\n\nCaleb is TA ONLY IF he is encouraging SIL in her vendetta. If he's tried to talk to his mum about the time and situation and all that happened and how he felt then I don't think he's an AH, his feelings are reasonable if he still feels like this stings after all this time, but if its overwhelming him and all his interactions with his mum he probably would benefit from speaking to someone about it and doing some reflection on what goes on.\n\nMum was TA for forgetting her sons bday, however I would also give her a pass for everything she had going on at the time. IF however she was ever the one who got the notion into OPs head that Caleb should have been helping to support the family then she is TA.", "Yes she couldn't give him all the attention he deserved but at that time she lost their home in a fire with 6 younger children. She was struggling to survive. It was a Mistake but you have to look at the whole picture.\n\nThe mother needs therapy and help but she has still 3 young children to take care of and works multiple jobs. If OP was relying on his Brother for Wifi u can assume they are struggling with money still to this day. Maybe they can't even afford therapy if they wanted.\n\nAnd I have to disagree with the birthday reminder, Theresa knew exactly what OP meant when he called her out on it, so Theresa knew what she was doing bringing up one of her hardest times in her life over and over again.", "For their own son? I would give a birthday reminder to my ex that my mom had a birthday coming up, not the other way around.", "But when will the mother get a chance to show that she remembers? OP is definitely YTA, but the daughter in law needs to back off and let things go. No contact would be a better option.", "If he needs this affirmation from a mother he hates ever year then her is also in need of some serious therapy and his girlfriend needs to mind her ****ing business", "Based off of what OP wrote the *forgetting caleb* trend extends further than before the fire, I just want to tack that on.", "I agree. It\u2019s also something that Caleb should talk to his own mother about if it was that hurtful. Not have his wife be the messenger.", "If you abandon or neglect your bio children (when they are still of the age of wanting/needing a parent) in favor of non biological children...are you really a good person? Are you a good parent? Are you really selfless? \n\nThose capable of love find it is limitless whether you have 1 child or 100. The fire happened months prior, that is not a good enough reason to not acknowledge something that is obviously very important to Caleb to feel like a wanted and loved member of the family. There is no proof Theresa is being vindictive, and OP is very one sided in this post. Maybe SIL thinks she is helping the situation. Theresa had to deal with the fallout of the mothers negligence. Perhaps she wants to stay ahead of the possible trauma and/or anxiety it causes every year, should mom forget again.", "Why should mom get a chance to fail again? What happens when she is once again so caught up in her other things she forgets his birthday again? Why should Caleb be put through that again just so his mom doesn\u2019t have to feel guilty? That\u2019s not fair to Caleb.", "If the wife knows how much the mom forgetting his birthday hurt him, why would she not do everything in her power to keep that from happening?", "Where does it say he hates his mom? His wife, ya know the one whose family took him in at 15, wants to make sure his mom doesn\u2019t forget this birthday, again a pretty normal thing"]}
