It sounds like your helping has now moved into enabling.  That's not a critique of you, but how the current situation looks like from the outside.  Of course you helped.  It's your family.  But now your mom and brother have no motivation to change.  \n\nMove out.  Give 30-60 days notice.  Have an emergency plan in place in case they make living at home untenable after you give notice.  That includes emotional abuse.  If possible see a therapist to help you with planning this (and setting boundaries with your family).  \n\nGoing forward limit your help to things that will provide them long term benefits, like help figuring out the medical issues, seeing if your brother wants to improve his quality of life (college, dietician, trade school or apprenticeship, doctor to help manage his disease etc).  He may want to move out too.  If so he'll need help learning how to be self-sufficient before actually moving out.  Offer to help him afford a better diet.  (BTW it's ok to be furious at your mother.  What she's done to your brother is medical abuse.  I'm furious at her on his behalf and I don't know him).  \n\nLive your life.  Don't let your family's decisions bring you down.  If they're willing to accept help you can help bring them up with you.  But don't let them keep you trapped in your current pattern.  Remember don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.", "NTA they will never step up while you\u2019re there. They also won\u2019t be homeless as you stated she owns the house. The utilities may get shut off, they will have to go get medicaid/Medicare/ebt etc but they\u2019ll have a roof over there heads and can figure it out. You can\u2019t do this for them. You\u2019re hurting yourself and SO if you stay and he will eventually leave as neither of you can start your lives there. Your brother is also an adult and can care for him self. Leave asap"]}
