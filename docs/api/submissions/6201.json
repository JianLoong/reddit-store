Great way to ring in the New Year! I\u2019ll try to outline the facts really quick:\n\nWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of holiday cooking at our house recently. We hosted his family at our house for Christmas Eve dinner (21 people). My husband flat out doesn\u2019t cook. So I prepared tons of food alone, at least 5 or 6 entrees he wanted. After the party was over, I put my feet up to help them stop throbbing. I had been standing for 8 hours to cook everything. So he and a few other people cleaned up the kitchen. Mind you: I offered to host his family dinner and he jumped at the idea. He wanted it to happen.\n\nThen we hosted a birthday party for a friend here a couple days ago. He may have done 40% of cleanup for that and I did 20%, and a friend did 40%. He also agreed to host this party.\n\nYesterday, he told me ahead of time that he wanted to get steaks for the New Year and cook them at home. That means that he wants me to cook them, because again, he never cooks. Fine, I can do that, I like to cook. He also said he\u2019s sick of washing dishes. I just did my thing and made a fancy 4-course dinner for our family. I\u2019ll say here that we have two children, 4M and 1M. So after I finished cooking, we ate together. I fed both of our kids because he doesn\u2019t feed the kids.\n\nAfter dinner, I could see the writing on the wall: he wanted me to do everything by myself. I said, we need to bathe the kids, do their nighttime routine, pack the rest of the food, and wash the dishes. Which two of the four things would you like? He said he can\u2019t bathe the kids because of his knees (he had surgery this last year on his knee), but he didn\u2019t want to clean the kitchen. I said it just wouldn\u2019t be fair for me to cook the food, feed the kids, bathe the kids, do their nighttime routine, pack the food, and wash the dishes by myself.\n\nHe grumbled but started cleaning up the kitchen. After we finished everything, he went off on me about how he cleans up after me so much, he feels like my mom. And he said he doesn\u2019t want to clean up after me anymore. If I want to cook, I need to clean up after myself.\n\nI said fine, but he can't eat anything that I make. I'll cook, feed our kids, and clean up after myself, but he can't eat anything I make. He said that he doesn\u2019t want to do that, because he likes my food more than frozen. He just wants me to cook and clean up after myself. I said no, because that just feels like a live-in-chef/maid to me.\n\nHe got really mad and said he is so unhappy that he wants a divorce. He said he hates cleaning up all this mess.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the a-hole: I think I\u2019m just making him accountable. I think he\u2019s mad that he has to do a fair share around our home. So I\u2019m not budging. I called him a grade A dick and manchild last night, and I honestly feel that way.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1672588683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100mhx2/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_clean_feed_bathe_kids/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does he realize he has to do ALL the cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the kids alone when he no longer lives with you?\n\nHe is not cleaning up \u201cyour mess\u201d. He is cleaning up after the party you both decided to throw.", "NTA. I completely agree that it sounds like he wants a live in maid and chef - and one who he can have sex with. He isn\u2019t acting like someone who wants a partner, because a partnership requires both people to pull their weight. I would call his bluff on the divorce thing and tell him that if the options are for you to single handedly do nearly all the daily housework and child raising or to get a divorce, then yes, you should get a divorce.\n\nYou\u2019re missing out on having an equal partner. The kids are missing out on seeing what a healthy marriage and partnership looks like. \n\nIt\u2019s likely he doesn\u2019t actually want a divorce and just wanted the upper hand and to scare you into doing what he wants by threatening it. In which case when he backs down I would insist on counseling. At the very least, you need to send him that internet post about mental loads and the default parent. (Here\u2019s a link to one with the comic that really started up this discussion online: https://businesschicks.com/mental-load/ )", "NTA. You ARE making him accountable. If he wants home cooked meals, the price of that is that the kitchen is messy, and it is the least amount of work to just clean it. Why aren't you saying to him that you're not his mom, and you can't cook, clean, and look after his kids for him?", "NTA - what does your husband bring to this marriage? He sounds lazy and entitled", "He doesn't want to be your partner, he wants to be your third child. You are absolutely in the right here, sharing duties is how a household works. He's not cleaning up after you, he's sharing the load of a daily care task that you do 100% of the time. NTA.", "NTA.    A rule with my wife: one cooks, one cleans.   \n\nI get his concerns about his knees and bathing but everyone needs to pull their weight.  If he can't do that, he can stand at a sink and do dishes.    \n\nI'd have a talk with him about household duties, and set some rules that you two agree on.", "NTA. What you are asking for is more than reasonable. It sounds like your husband is either making up drama to get a divorce or his expectations of your partnership is heavily skewed.", "NTA. Also, a person who throws out \u201cI want a divorce\u201d is someone *who wants a divorce*. And in this case, deserves one.", "NTA. You likely already know this, but you have three children. The eldest is older than you. \n\nA divorce may be the way to cut your workload. I know it will be hard for a load of other reasons! But consider: can you do this level of work for another 13 years? Is he going to teach your kids that mom does everything for the boys, forever? You're staring down a long tunnel, here.", "NTA\n\nWhat he wants is a mommy. What he\u2019s got is a wife. Stick to your guns. His behaviour is frankly pathetic. Tell him you\u2019ll be happy with his divorce plans. It\u2019s one less child to care for.", "You are being gaslighted.  He is being incredibly self centered and has no respect ir concern for your well being.  You cook for hours with no help & he wont cleanup? Wtf?", "NTA. Just stop cooking for him, his friend and his family. If you invite friends or family, you do the clean up and don't make anything for him. Leave his dishes, his laundry, etc., for him to do. It's not your job and you shouldn't have to ask your partner for help with chores in a house you both live in, or to feed or bathe his own kids. \n\nYou can go way further as well: divide everything. Get your own cupboard or mini fridge for snacks. Only do grocery shopping for you and the kids. \n\nTell him you will stop when he decides to act like a grown ass man and share the work equally.\n\nIf he wants a divorce, great. Let's see him cope with the kids, cooking, cleaning and working for two weeks a month. I would fight for 50/50 custody and enjoy watching him struggle. If he refuses 50/50, hire a cleaning service with what he'll have to pay you.", "NTA. His threat of divorce would mean you only have to clean up after and mother two kids instead of three, I would jump at that offer.", "NTA! Rule in our house is the person that cooks isn\u2019t the person that cleans.", "NTA and you need to leave his ass", "NTA, are you sure you don't have 3 children? Seems your husband is the biggest baby in the house. Tell him to get his lazy ass up and start doing his share of the chores.", "NTA. He\u2019s not pulling his weight at all and threatening divorce when asked to help out is extremely childish. Who\u2019s going to cook & clean for him if/when he\u2019s on his own? You have every right to be upset about how he\u2019s treating you.", "NTA\n\nYou got the nail on the head. He wants a live-in maid and chef! He doesn't respect the amount of work you put in providing for your family. So if he wants to walk out over it, so be it.\n\nIf he gets his way, the amount of work will actually be higher for you than if he just packed his crap and left.", "NTA  He wants a divorce because he doesn't want to clean up or help in any way, yet he's more than happy to make dinner plans that include you cooking?  lol  He's got a lot to learn.  I think you need to go out of town to help a sick relative.  Make sure to leave a list of everything he will need to do while you're gone.  Then when you return sign him up for a basic cooking class.  He's going to need it for the weekends he has the kids once you get divorced.", "NTA ask him who he thinks will clean the kitchen if he divorced you", "NTA stand your ground girl!", "NTA\n\nBut your husband sounds like a nightmare, can\u2019t even cook a steak for the wife. What a keeper! \n\nTill death do you part. Enjoy", "NTA and at this rate you\u2019re probably better off with the divorce. If you\u2019re gonna have to do it all by yourself at least have the freedom and independence of doing it all yourself", "So he can't cook or won't cook? If it's the first he can learn, the latter he's lazy. And if one cooks the other cleans, thems the rules dude. Because if he wants you to do it all, that's a big NOPE in my book. He's saying divorce just to scare you. I would say fine, you can take care of Everything 50% of the time, cleaning, kids, laundry cooking.  He will not do that. NTA.", "NTA. Your husband is a dick.", "NTA\n\nAlso, if he isn't already doing so, he needs to start washing, folding, and putting away his own clothes too.  (My husband was always complaining about certain items that he'd worn recently not being clean yet and clean clothes not having been folded yet.  He thought laundry took no time at all and said he'd wash his clothes himself.  I finally took him up on his offer and have one less chore to do and don't have to listen to his complaints about his laundry.)", "NTA Sorry you're dealing with a less than equal partner.", "NTA  Three celebratory meals - one with 21 people - and he wants to complain about having to do anything but eat.  Ask him when he plans to move out and how he wants to handle his 50% custody of the children.   Since he expects you to do all the work, what use does he have?", "NTA. Nothing will ruin a relationship quicker than uneven work load. No one person should be doing the work of the household. If he can't equally help out and contribute and you are unhappy consider the divorce a good thing. Just remember if you fold and stay without him contributing more you are essentially giving him permission to put the workload on you. \n\nSo ask yourself if you stay and this continues will you be happy? Do you feel loved and respected as a partner? If this is how upset you are now I want you to think of the next 5, 10 years.", "NTA he is exactly what you said he was. If cranky-pants threatens you with divorce over the basic activities of daily living he can go sit in the corner.", "NTA. The fact that you both work full time and he doesn't want to share any responsibility at home baffles me. You even tried to let him choose which chores he would prefer. He can't expect you to keep cooking what he wants and not help.\n\nAlso threatening divorce in a disagreement like this is a bold move, nip that in the bud. Take him seriously and watch him panic.", "Get a new husband", "Info: is this new behavior from him or has he been like this your entire relationship?", "NTA you basically have an extra child rather than a husband. Get the divorce, sounds like your life will be easier considering he contributes barely anything anyway.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s expecting you to do 100% of the work. The fact that he\u2019s bringing up divorce over you holding him accountable for 50% of the work is a HUGE RED FLAG.\n\nIt\u2019s like he\u2019s expecting you to beg him not to leave you and resign yourself to being his servant. \n\nTake care of yourself and your kids. He can figure himself out. \n\nYOU ARE NOT HIS SERVANT", "NTA you're supposed to be partners , that includes things that are less fun to do..", "Nta. Ask him how's the divorce going to make him happier when rather than doing the tiny amount that you ask him to do he would then have to do all of it on his own when he had the kids. In my opinion he's trying to gaslight you a little bit by saying he'd want a divorce thinking you'll want to keep the marriage all because he's too lazy to do stuff", "Nta at all he's trying to flip everything on you saying he feels like your mother when he wants you to cook, and clean and fully take care of his kids for him alone.\nDoes he do anything around the house even laundry, vacuuming, etc? He is lazy and entitled and wants to not have any home responsibility he needs to man up and stop being a toddler himself", "NTA I\u2019d call his bluff and tell him to file. He basically doesn\u2019t want to do anything. Stop cooking for him. If you think this marriage can be saved I\u2019d talk to him about couples counseling. But you\u2019ve been dealing with this for so long, there is a good chance he won\u2019t change.", "Soooooo NTA I don\u2019t even know where to begin. You are your husbands maid, wife AND mommy. My partner pulled something like this once when we were both working but I had to somehow cook and clean every night. I went on strike for a week and he backtracked so fast realizing what a tool he was being. \n\nIt sounds like your husband wants the old school marriage where he sits on the sofa with a beer while you take care of the whole house. Why doesn\u2019t he feed the kids? Why does he not get the you cook I clean concept? Why have a family at all if everything is too much work for him? \n\nYou should have to convince him to pitch in and help. I\u2019d call his bluff. And if it\u2019s not a bluff we\u2019ll then maybe you deserve a partner who actually wants to love on and support you. Couples counseling would be a great place to start.", "Why are you married to an eight year old?", "Call his bluff. From now on, you do nothing for him. No laundry, no cooking, no cleaning. He does everything for himself, by himself. He wants friends over, he organizes the food. See how fast he caves. NTA", "And who is gonna wash his dishes when he's divorced?\n\nDo you like him? Do you two get along? Because you never once said \"he's great, but...\". Maybe this marriage has run its course.", "NTA. He asked for a divorce. Call his bluff and find a lawyer and get one.", "NTA\n\n\nYour initial thought was spot on. He is literally after a maid he gets to shag.\n\n\nIs he ever even nice to you? Because from what you've written, divorce would improve your quality of life 100%.", "NTA: If you both are working \"outside\" (sounds like you both WFH) the home then it's completely fair for an even split on jobs inside the home\n\n~~Do both of you work outside of the home~~\n\n~~I would say if one person is stay-at-home, it would be fair for them to take on more (not all) of the household tasks.~~", "What is the work hours outside the home schedule like for the 2 of you?", "NTA but you need to have a talk.  And some more information may be needed. \n\nDoes he shovel the snow? Work from home? Are you a stay at home mom while he works?  Will he help with kids in other ways or when his knee is better.  Do the kids get baths every night?  \n\nKids don\u2019t need baths every night so you could have eliminated that. \n\nAs so dishes. I realize this is a holiday time so possibly with more dishes than usual and both you and he may not be working.  My husband doesn\u2019t work so he does cook and does the dishes. He is terrible about doing things as he goes so I feel zero guilt about not helping him because he makes more work for himself that way (or for whomever would clean up). \n\nIn your situation I would suggest you do dishes together such as one washes and one dries and puts them away, but you certainly could ask for more especially if both work. \n\nGood luck. It\u2019s hard for men to change if they didn\u2019t have a good role model but no excuse. \n\nOh adding with the steaks- do you have a BBQ?  You cook everything but he can BBQ the steaks\n\n\nEDIT. In my situation I work away from home. Husband does not work.  I do the shovelling and most of the farm chores here too.  He will literally stand there on his phone while something is cooking instead of using that time to put a pot in the sink or wipe the counter after he spilled something on it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like, he says if he were to make a meal, he would do it without any mess. But that\u2019s easy to do when you make a frozen meal\u2026 which he says he doesn\u2019t like. I think he just doesn\u2019t understand the reality of cooking and cleaning homemade meals.", "Seems like he should demonstrate how to make what he like you to create minus making any mess. And if he can't or won't his no mess claim is ridiculous.", "Sounds like he needs to show you how it\u2019s done. \n\nPut your feet up & watch him cook oh-so-tidily :-)", "[removed]", "Sounds to me like it's time for him to start making his own meals then so he can see what it's like. If he don't like frozen, then he can look up recipes.\n\nMatter of fact, stop doing anything for him. Not his laundry, not his food, don't clean his mess, nothing. Full strike except for what you, and the kids need.", "Yep, have him make a meal from scratch with no mess. If he can't, which we all know he can't, call out his bullshit.\n\nAlso, unless you eat off paper plates every night, there will be dishes regardless of how clean the cook is.", "For his next trick, he can teach a one year old and four year old how to get themselves ready for bed. \ud83e\udd23", "Also, NTA", "Seriously, this man needs to start cooking his own damn meals. But that still doesn\u2019t absolve him from any childcare responsibilities. He won\u2019t FEED his kids???"]}
