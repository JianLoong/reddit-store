For both your sakes. :)", "NTA. I pick out my favorite parts, too, but only with my own ice cream. It's rude and borderline (maybe more than just borderline) disrespectful to do that to ice cream that you share or that belongs to someone else. I'd be demanding they buy me a new ice cream and finish off the ice cream they mutilated on their own.", "NTA.   That is annoying and inconsiderate of her.  But it's funny too, lol.", "NTA. \u201cNo digging\u201d is the rule around here. If you\u2019re caught digging once you must surrender your spoon.", "NTA\n\nNext time scoop it out into a bowl. That way she won't pick out the good parts and leave the vanilla behind. She may still only eat the caramel but it won't be as devastating as the proportion of the good stuff would be limited to part of a serving and not part of a tub.", "This is a class D felony where I live", "This is comparable to offering someone some of your pizza and they go and eat all the topics off of it and hand you back the base with only tomato sauce left. \n\nThey would not only be banned from ever getting offered any food, but i would ban them from my life.

It sounds delicious.", "NTA But in the future I would just get two tubs.", "Reminds me of the South Park episode where the kids get KFC and cartman eats all the skin before they can. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Pretty reasonable request if you as me. I don\u2019t mind getting a few mined bites of my moose tracks to feed my partner but I handed the tub and ate a good portion of the good bits on their own I\u2019d be p upset about it tbh and probably react the same.", "NTA. That was selfish of your GF.", "NTA \n\nyour tub your rules", "NTA. How dare she", "NTA\n\n\nWhat is she, Cartman eating all the skins off of the fried chicken??", "My other half and I agree. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nHowever, one tub each might be a good idea", "NTA.

Was very afraid this was going to be a \"I don't want my partner putting on weight\" post, but this is fair. If you can't respect the ice cream social contract, you have to buy your own ice cream.", "OP, your post is hilarious, but there's going to be at least a few people in here who tell you to break up/get divorced unironically.  It'll be something like:\n\n>OP, I know you're making a joke, but honestly what kind of selfish person does this?  She obviously doesn't care about you or your feelings.  I bet she even says she doesn't want anything from McDonald's then eats all your fries.  You should cut your losses and find someone who wants to share the swirl with you.  Life's too short to waste it on someone that inconsiderate.", "NTA. I would have noticed and said something, though. \u201cYou digging for gold in MY ice cream?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been married for 22 years and have a 16 year old.

It's absolutely selfish to take the best parts for yourself *knowing* it belongs to someone else. I don't think it's at all cute or funny that your gf has so little self-control that she couldn't spare a thought for *your* enjoyment of *your* ice cream you were kind enough to share with her. This is definitely a sore spot for me though, so if it's not that big a deal to you, great. NTA.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I don't get it. When i buy a mixed bag of nuts she will pour them out in a bowl and eat all the good ones and put the rest back. Share FFS. You women can be animals.", "You should not BAN them. You should explain them how it makes you feel sad. They will stop. If they don\u2019t ask them why they care so much about it and try to find a solution or compromise.

My partner and I have very different views on food sharing. He, like your partner apparently, is of the opinion that whoever wants something more has the right to finish it. I am of the opinion that someone might be saving something for later so best to ask before eating all of it.
