The parents both have a job that requires very early morning hours, they are sports coaches and work with a lot of people still in school. I get there before 6am and help their kids get up and get ready for school.\n\nFairly regularly they will tell me to come 30 minutes later than usual, often they don\u2019t tell me until they wake up and see they\u2019ve had a student cancel. This means I don\u2019t see that until I\u2019ve also woken up. I understand that\u2019s inevitable in their line of work. Sometimes, they completely cancel if they\u2019ve had enough cancellations, and I also don\u2019t see that until I wake up. Today I was in my car heading there when they canceled.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of asking them to pay half what I would\u2019ve made or at least for an hour of my time when they completely cancel last minute. I know they can\u2019t control their students, but I try to budget for the money I expect to get and I also can\u2019t keep waking up at 5am and lose sleep just to be cancelled on. I think it\u2019s particularly frustrating when I\u2019m on the way or about to get in my car.

I would suggest that you come up with a policy that is general for all of your clients instead of one that is specific to these particular clients. That way your policy won\u2019t appear vindictive. For example, you can say that if if your clients postpone the time of service less than 12 hours in advance, they are responsible for paying half of your fee for the canceled time frame.", "NTA. Your time is valuable and you could have scheduled a different client in that timeslot had you known they would cancel. It's perfectly reasonable to have a 24-hour cancellation policy; most professionals do.\n\nAnd actually, you should charge the whole fee, not just half, if they cancel on such short notice. It's so inconsiderate and they should know better.", "NTA, at the end of the day you're running a business. Consider what it is worth to you, (and/or consult others in your business) so you can give the family a specific policy of how much notice they need to give and what a late cancellation will cost.", "NAH. I would just have a talk about it. They likely don't want to go find a new sitter, you seem to like the arrangement. Do they even know the dominio issue this causes? I'd talk before dropping the fee. There may be another way around this quagmire.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s cool of you to acknowledge that changes are inevitable in their line of work, but your time is just as valuable as theirs! If they were offering *you* a service and you regularly canceled last minute, I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t appreciate it either. Just explain that you\u2019re trying to optimize your schedule so that you have more time in the day, and request a 12-24 hour cancellation notice (or however long you prefer), or you\u2019ll charge for an hour (or half) of the expected time. If they are reasonable people, this should be no problem at all.", "I think that\u2019s fair, but you have to get it in writing and prepare yourself for them to balk and possibly fire you. I lost a long term client and a family friend over something similar because they thought my rules were \u201cjust a suggestion,\u201d since they never signed anything. \n\nNTA", "NTA! You should join a nanny group on Facebook and most would agree you\u2019re not the asshole here! I\u2019d get frustrated, especially because you could have fit another family in, scheduled an appointment, took another part-time position, etc. in that time frame that they\u2019ve cancelled on you. It\u2019s selfish", "NTA. But I would have a very honest sit- down with them and outline terms about what is considered a last- minute cancelation, terms, fees, etc.", "**NAH**, as long as you apply somewhat reasonable terms. For example I would think a cancellation fee if they cancel less than 12 hours before the start would be very reasonable and generous from you. Even 24h might be okay, it depends on how much you like the gig and how much hardball you\u2019re willing to play.", "As long as you give them a heads up you're NTA.  That way, no hidden costs and everyone is on the same page.  It's also a fair ask as well as last minute cancellations do come with a cost to you.", "NTA\n\nSometimes you have to cancel, that's just how it goes.\n\nHowever sometimes the other person has put time, money and effort in before they ever start. \n\nThe only issue I have is, you should be upfront with these kinds of thing, you'd probably be better off having a talk with them and saying moving forward there will be a cancellation fee.\n\nConsidering the business they are in, they should understand.", "NTA but might loose a customer.  Gonna have to talk to your customer.  At worst; you babysat for them for a long time then you can guesstimate a reasonable number of cancellations per month/season/year to build into your new price(s).  Straight up charge if exceeded or recalculate next season's rates?  Work with what you got.", "NTA, just communicate that ahead of time rather than springing it on them if/when this happens again. A fee out of the blue wouldn\u2019t be a good idea and you might lose their business, but talking to them about a policy change doesn\u2019t make you an AH and is a very good idea, to protect yourself and maybe get them to cancel less often", "YWNBTA -- but I don't imagine that they'll agree to this, and it will cost you a relationship with your customer and possibly damage your ability to get future customers. Discussing the matter with them would probably be a better option than presenting them with an ultimatum.", "YWBTA of you just spring it on them out of nowhere, but if you sit down and talk to them about it and outline a plan and rates, then NTA. Half the lost pay might be much, but an hour or two might be reasonable. In my state there is a 3-week schedule law for most businesses, and if they cancel a shift then you get compensated, but it's not a half day even.", "NTA.\n\nGive them notice of your changes so they are aware. Your time needs to be respected, and if they can't do that, the least is to pay for a last-minute cancelation fee. It's not much different from other services out there. Unfortunately, it's come to this, but they don't respect your schedule or time.", "NTA. If it is less than 24 hours notice they still need to pay you.", "NAH\n\nJust outline this for future work and make sure they are aware, ideally in writing. I would not ask about it for past cancellations. This would both avoid an argument as well as make them feel better about the arrangement. Asking for past cancellations would kinda feel like \"altering the deal\".\n\nOne way to structure it is to have a non-refundable booking fee that covers X hours and additional hours are at Y rate. Perhaps something with the half idea if that can be written out clearly.\n\nIf they're family maybe you don't need a contract but just talk it out before committing to future work. Explain why such as the opportunity cost if you would be working on something else or costs related to travel if it's super last min. They may also opt to just not cancel or maybe barter like make you dinner or something.", "I would say that you may be AH if you to it out of the blue, they have cancelled before without any repercusions before and now \\*pop\\*, I want to charge.\n\nNot saying that how they behaved is okay, but I would just try to have a friendly chat with them about what happened and warn them for future cancelation.\n\nI would give you a very slight YWBTAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are FOR SURE getting their fee for those canceled sessions.", "NTA as long as you come up with a clear rule and explain it upfront. Might be worth considering some kind of retainer or on-call fee, or maybe just explain to them why it's an issue for you.", "Info what's the cancelation arrangement they have for their students? I think it would be only reasonable to do something similar. I would expect they still charge...", "NTA\n\nYou have set aside this time for their family, and this is your job.  If they cancel at the last second, they need to pay you anyway. \n\nBe a professional.  Get with an attorney and write out a contract, and stick to it.  \n\nMy hair stylest has a policy that if you cancel less than 72 hours before your appointment, you still owe for it.", "NTA. But it's going to be extremely difficult to implement that policy now after 3 years without it.", "NAH. I understand having a line of work that doesn't have the most reliable of hours. However, you're also working and need a reliable income. I think a cancellation policy is a great idea, it ensures that you're still making money and kinda forces the parents to really think about if they need your services that day. Your time and efforts are important! A canceled shift is a day that you could have made plans or scheduled another gig. \n\nSource: I'm a massage therapist and work for a woman who established a cancelation policy that requires payment IN FULL if you no show us. We're there ready to work, and that appointment could have been filled if they canceled in a timely manner.", "NTA  \n\n\nif it is acceptable for DR's to do it is acceptable for anyone to have a late cancelation fee.  \n\n\nbut if it is a new introduction it is best to let them know beforehand, so they are aware of it, they can decide to not retain your services if they are too cheap to pay the fees", "This is a very good point! OP has been babysitting for them for 3 years. I imagine they'd be receptive to having a sit down talk about this. That way they understand the domino effect this plays on OPs financial security.", "I will talk to them! The last time I talked to them about finances was when I realized they were really underpaying after I spoke to other sitters and families in the area and it was really awkward so I wanted to check here that it wasn\u2019t unreasonable/an AH move. I think I\u2019d like to just generally know early enough that I could at least sleep.\n\nI think today was frustrating because I\u2019m almost positive the parent who was home and canceled slept as long as they could so they just didn\u2019t see that their students had all cancelled. Which I get sleeping in, but we had a snow storm yesterday and a lot of schools were closed today but they had told me to plan on coming so I feel like it would\u2019ve made sense to at least wake up earlier to check for cancellations. I was 5 minutes away when I they texted. I definitely wouldn\u2019t spring it on them without a conversation!", "Also I\u2019d avoid making it personal. Saying they\u2019ve cancelled multiple times may make them defensive. They get cancelled on too so I\u2019d go from that angle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you can relate to the inconvenience of late notice for cancellations, unfortunately while this hasn\u2019t been a problem for me before I\u2019ve recently been having an issue with families cancelling when I\u2019m already leaving and obviously that leaves me in a pickle. So from next week I\u2019ll be invoking a new policy where I require X amount of notice, less than that will incur a charge of Y.\u201d", "She should DEFINITELY have a contract. Especially when you are dealing with family or friends. That way both parties know exactly what to expect and you can avoid hurt feelings from a misunderstanding or miscommunication.", "Hard disagree.  They cancel on her out of the blue on a consistent basis.  Nothing wrong with OP politely explaining that they've noticed this is a recurring issue and they've revamped their employment agreements with clients going forward.", "My family paid our sitter 20 a week to be on call when she decided to go get her masters. Some weeks we used her, alot of weeks we didn't but she was great, kid loved her and it meant more to us just knowing she'd answer the phone when we called (took us 2 months to even find her). \n\nIf I'm making money and need a sitter to do so, before we change the financials, I would want to know if my actions were causing an issue. Heck, I may be able to pass along this fee OR increase my fee on the front end.", "A contract is a good thing to consider but people often don't do that for side gig type work for family. Either it's seen as too formal or they don't know where to get the legal language. There are logistics about getting a contract or hassle with it. More worth it to figure out if it was a reusable thing for multiple clients. There are probably boiler plate babysitting contracts floating around.\n\nIn writing could also be a text or more of a policy rather than a signed legal document. Then if they don't live up to that you just don't agree to do the work anymore. Unless of course OP wants to go to small claims against a family member over it.", "But they have canceled before, without penalties. What would you say if a company allows you to cancel a service anytime but suddenly the charge you 100$ without warning you because they don\u2019t like it anymore? Would you pay or complain?\n\nFirst, explain the new policy, then, charge.", "That's such a clever idea! Was there ever a time she was called but couldn't help because of school? If so, what would happen?", "Only time she didn't we just cancelled our plans. Occasionally she called us to volunteer times. Funny bit is the relationship eventually ended when friends of ours offered her free housing to move in and help with their 3 kids...which was an idea we had floated, offering her our guest room lol"]}
