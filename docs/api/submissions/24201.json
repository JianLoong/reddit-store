It might not have been a kind thing to say but it's fair to say that you've been pushed to the limit. Your mother created this situation and your father hasn't really supported you the way that he should have. Now they have to deal with the inevitable consequences.", "NTA. Who cares about a few unkind things you said when they took you to Disney, and LEFT YOU IN THE HOTEL because your brother said so.

At least Rachel's mom is there for you...\n\nThe main problem is that you resent your brother who... Well, I'm gonna be flooded with negative carma, but your brother is sick. He can't function like a normal person and you mom clearly doesn't do a good job figuring stuff out to balance your relationship.  Anyway, it's not your brother's fault he was born sick, so try to not resent him that much...", "Slight ESH I would have said NTA but saying that in front of your brother was pretty mean. Having autism isn't something he has control over, but it sounds like your mom doesn't really help him so much as enable him.  So I understand your frustration and want to say your feelings are valid, but they should be directed at your mom, not your brother.  He never asked to be born this way or treated the way he his by your mom either. She's not doing him any favors.  Your mom shouldn't neglect you in favor of your brother.  So try and remember this situation is a result of your parents' actions and direct your anger at them.", "NTA\n\nThe reason I'm excusing the devastating comment in front of your brother is because your mom has already prioritized him. \n\nThis really sucks that a special needs child has hogged all the time, leaving none for you.\n\nLuckily, you have your friend and father to make life easier.\n\nThis situation really highlights the complexity of having an autistic child - sure the right thing to do is help them, but is it right to give them 100% of your time and attention?", "YTA for saying that in front of him, especially since he's already going to be treated differently by others for having autism. However, your feelings of neglect are valid and your parents should definitely be more thoughtful towards you.", "ESH\n\nYou do need to be kinder to your brother, it's not his fault that he's autistic. Hate your mom, she's the one who sucks at parenting, she's the one who failed you many times.

Your dad is a hero though, at least he has your back", "NTA,  \nIt was crass but it wasn't asshole.", "NTA because it's your parents' fault that you wish your brother had never been born.

You would have had two loving parents who cared about your needs. I'm sorry your family is so toxic and that your parents don't see what harm they've caused you.\n\nExpressing your feelings in front of your brother was a bit mean but again, your parents have no one to blame but themselves.", "NTA due to your age and parentification.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to take him with you or anything.", "Your parents are neglectful but at least your dad has enough about him to realise you do have needs.\n\nNTA\n\nYou were not kind but in the context of the neglect you have experiences it's entirely understandable. Thank goodness you have a parent figure.", "YTA wow, grow up.  Look I have a brother with special needs, okay? It\u2019s hard sometimes, but they can\u2019t help how they\u2019re born. Apologize to your mother.", "YTA but so is your mom. Saying that about a special needs child is wrong but he is their son and shouldn't expect you to cater to him", "ESH but you are more so the soft AH in this just for the comment. Your mom sounds like the main reason for causing the resentment you have towards them and your brother.\n\nI'm sure you hear it enough but autism isn't your brother's fault so some grace needs to be given there. I'm not sure how bad his autism is but your mom seems to potentially over coddle him. \n\nIt seems your dad empathizes with you, so I can only hope that he continues to step in and side with you going on this trip. You have a great friend in Rachel and her family sounds fantastic!", "NTA, OP. Parentification is ABUSE. Your \"family\" obviously doesn't care about you and your mother has some nerve to call you ungrateful. Like what would you be grateful for ? She's neglectful and only remembers you exist when she needs help with your brother...", "See if you can move into Rachel\u2019s house, your parents will probably not even realize that you\u2019ve moved out\u2026 until they need a babysitter.", "NTA. Go enjoy yourself.", "Obviously YTA for that last comment. It was unnecessarily mean. Esp. since he was in the room.\n\nNTA for feeling looked over and forgotten.

Your mom wants to be abusive and negligent, but never deal with the horrific results of how badly you're suffering.\n\nIf he's so ND like people keep saying, hearing his sister who he has learned up treat VERY badly, won't really bother him in the long run. Sounds like he's growing up to be, like many boys, excessively spoiled and babied instead of treatment, discipline, and life skills training.\n\nHave fun at Disneyland.

It's crazy that your parents are completely neglecting your feelings to placate your brother's unreasonable demands. Forcing you to stay in the hotel so that they can visit Disneyland alone with your brother is abusive, and you could literally have called the police and had them arrested for abandonment for doing that. I understand why you would direct your anger at your brother, but you really should be directing it at your parents. Instead of teaching your brother healthy ways to cope with frustration they're raising him to be a selfish monster and teaching you to resent him. Enjoy your Disney World trip with Rachel.", "YTA. Do you feel better about yourself for taking out your feelings and frustrations with your parents, particularly your mother, on a child who can\u2019t always control his actions and doesn\u2019t seem to have had any help learning how to behave?

I hope you still get to go to Disney ( says a person that spend a good chunk of her childhood with other neurodivergent kids and boy it was hell )", "I'm going with ESH, but I can hardly blame you for being an AH in this too. Your response about not caring about your brother and wishing he wasn't born is definitely rooted in anger and frustration with the unfair hand you were dealt. You're just a kid so I don't blame you one bit for having that reaction. That said, it doesn't absolve you of being an AH.\n\nYour parents are of course the bigger AHs for how you are treated. You sound like someone lacking attention from her parents, and your mom can't, or won't see that. Your dad seems to be on your side, but he also is very non-confrontational about it. He's sort of okay with whatever you are okay with to keep the peace, and it's not clear if he is busy working a lot, or simply doing other things instead of prioritizing his kids. So that means you mostly butt heads with your mom since she is the main caretaker it seems. Then there's your brother, who by all accounts seems innocent in this. Maybe all his outbursts are a product of his autism, or maybe a product of his upbringing. Regardless, the kid is 9, so compassion and understanding should be given with him. The way your mom treats you both differently is another story and probably where most of the problems you have with the situation stem from. I disagree with your mom punishing you for having an escape from your brother that it sounds like your mom does not have.\n\nAll in all, count your blessings that even in such a crap situation you have a \"2nd family\" outlet with Rachel and her mom. Many don't have that who get stuck in a situation like yours. Both your parents seem absent from your life despite you living with them and hopefully you can all reconnect before permanent damage is done. You're young, and you should speak your mind, but try not to do too much damage as they are still your family and like it or not there's a high probability you are connected with them the rest of your life.

It\u2019s your parents, not a 9 year old child, that are doing this to you.  Hating your brother for how your parents act isn\u2019t ok.  Telling someone you wish they didn\u2019t exist is not ok.
