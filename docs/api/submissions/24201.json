Her mom is the nicest person I\u2019ve ever met. Rachel and I played soccer but my mom was rarely able to take me to practices and games so Rachel\u2019s mom would always take me.

Rachel\u2019s mom was at every performance for me even though Rachel wasn\u2019t in choir. \n\nThose are just a few examples, but Rachel\u2019s mom has always been there for me when my parents weren\u2019t available. My mom never really cares what I\u2019m doing unless she needs me to watch my brother so I spend a lot of time at Rachel\u2019s house. Once I spent a whole weekend there and my mom didn\u2019t even call to ask where I am. Rachel\u2019s family go on a lot of vacations and they often take me. \n\nThey\u2019re going to Disney World during Thanksgiving break and invited me to come with them. I asked my dad and he said I could go. They\u2019ve already planned and booked everything and I\u2019m really excited. I\u2019ve been to Disneyland once with my family and it was horrible. My brother threw a huge tantrum on the first day because he wanted to go on the rides alone and sit between mom and dad so I had to stay in the hotel most of the time. \n\nMy brother found out that I\u2019m going to Disney and he had a really big melt down. He loves Disney and he was mad that I was going without him. My mom told me that she was planning to go to Washington to visit my grandparents. My dad didn\u2019t say anything about that so I\u2019m pretty sure she just made that up to stop me from going. And even if they are going, I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to go on a fourteen hour car ride with my brother and I\u2019m pretty sure when we get there they\u2019re either going to make me stay with him while they go out or take him out and leave me alone in the hotel (I also wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go out on my own).\n\nShe told me that I need to think about my brother and his feelings are more important because he\u2019s younger and autistic. I told her that I honestly don\u2019t give a f*ck about my brother\u2019s feelings and I wish he was never born. He was there when I said all this and he\u2019s been crying and screaming for the last three hours and it\u2019s giving me a headache. My mom has been trying to calm him down and my dad said that he\u2019ll still let me go because he understands I\u2019m frustrated (he also grew up with a neurodivergent siblings so he knows what it\u2019s like). My mom said that I\u2019m a rude, ungrateful brat and I need to be kinder to my brother. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Idk if this is important but we live in California and went to Disneyland in Anaheim.

You aren't ungrateful because you're always grateful for everything Rachel's mother does for you, but that you will at least try to be kinder than that last comment. You don't have to like him, or even have anything to do with him after you're an adult and move out. It's probably best to not provoke anybody though, because those two years are still an eighth of your life.

It might not have been a kind thing to say but it's fair to say that you've been pushed to the limit. Your mother created this situation and your father hasn't really supported you the way that he should have. Now they have to deal with the inevitable consequences.", "NTA.

He can't function like a normal person and you mom clearly doesn't do a good job figuring stuff out to balance your relationship.  Anyway, it's not your brother's fault he was born sick, so try to not resent him that much...", "Slight ESH I would have said NTA but saying that in front of your brother was pretty mean. Having autism isn't something he has control over, but it sounds like your mom doesn't really help him so much as enable him.  So I understand your frustration and want to say your feelings are valid, but they should be directed at your mom, not your brother.  He never asked to be born this way or treated the way he his by your mom either. She's not doing him any favors.  Your mom shouldn't neglect you in favor of your brother.

Hate your mom, she's the one who sucks at parenting, she's the one who failed you many times.

Your dad is a hero though, at least he has your back", "NTA,  \nIt was crass but it wasn't asshole.", "NTA because it's your parents' fault that you wish your brother had never been born.

Saying that about a special needs child is wrong but he is their son and shouldn't expect you to cater to him", "ESH but you are more so the soft AH in this just for the comment. Your mom sounds like the main reason for causing the resentment you have towards them and your brother.\n\nI'm sure you hear it enough but autism isn't your brother's fault so some grace needs to be given there. I'm not sure how bad his autism is but your mom seems to potentially over coddle him. \n\nIt seems your dad empathizes with you, so I can only hope that he continues to step in and side with you going on this trip. You have a great friend in Rachel and her family sounds fantastic!", "NTA, OP. Parentification is ABUSE. Your \"family\" obviously doesn't care about you and your mother has some nerve to call you ungrateful. Like what would you be grateful for ?

Your mom wants to be abusive and negligent, but never deal with the horrific results of how badly you're suffering.\n\nIf he's so ND like people keep saying, hearing his sister who he has learned up treat VERY badly, won't really bother him in the long run. Sounds like he's growing up to be, like many boys, excessively spoiled and babied instead of treatment, discipline, and life skills training.\n\nHave fun at Disneyland.

For real, not as internet snark, are you ok? \n\nThe way he will learn that he can't always get everything wants- and that that's ok and he can still cope with life despite his extra sensitivity to things not going according to plan- is not by being faced with 'hard truths' that he 'forced' his sister to be excluded etc like in some big speech chewing him out for all this happening. It's in facing and getting through circumstances where he doesn't get what he wants, then getting it explained to him in developmentally appropriate terms why he couldn't have it. Including making sure that when one of the reasons is other's people's needs, that's specifically highlighted and he is told that you have to make room for others even when it's hard because it's the right thing to do and it's a way to be nice to people. And taught that even when he can't always do that proactively on his own- which he probably won't be able to, neurologically-when the situations come up where he's told \"this is happening differently because your sister wants X so we're going to compromise, have support each time to understand that it's not about taking something away from him or messing with his plan, which is how he's hard wired to view it, but is about doing the right thing.", "The brother is a young child with a disability--and was a younger one whenever it was that they went to Disney previously--who has terrible parents. His behavior is not his fault and he cannot be blamed.", "Autism is literally a disability for most people with the condition and it's one that can affect how you view the world and interact with people so it can negatively affect behaviour, yes bad behaviour should be corrected and as stated that was the parents fault not the child's.\n\n A child being a spoiled brat and having a meltdown/tantrum does not justify saying he should never have been born, that was extreme and disproportionate for something that was driven by his parents, not the child. \n\n I did not say her feelings were not valid just that saying them in front of the brother is wrong. The blame should be on the parents who are creating this situation and should explain to the 9 year old that they can't go. The brother being told such horrible things (that could stick with them for life) should not be excused as collateral damage and was still wrong.", "Yeah. And even without a diagnosis I\u2019ve seen the same thing happen when there is a \u201cGolden Child\u201d and a \u201cScapegoat\u201d. Sometimes this is due to a legitimate need like a diagnosis but sometimes it is due to birth order, gender/sex, origin of birth (aka stepchild/adoptive/foster). It\u2019s still 100% the parents fault at that age because they have limited access to any other experience. Once they reach middle/high school they can start learning and having different life experiences which hopefully teaches them that they aren\u2019t the center of the universe. However, even at that age sometimes the teaching of the parents over ride the other experiences. At 9yrs they are barely old enough to go on a sleep over, hang with peers without parents, or even go play by themselves in the neighborhood. All they know is what mommy/daddy shows and tell them. So thy can hardly be responsible for believing what mommy and daddy have taught them.", "Once again, you're inserting yourself and your family into this. \n\nObviously, you're very high functioning. Everyone does not have that ability. It's not about you and your experience. This isn't sexism simply because your parents didn't understand you and your needs and held you to a different standard than this child is being held to. \n\nI would hope you learned from their mistakes, but if you think it's okay to hit a child, much less one with special needs, I fear you may not have.", "What should they have done? Locked him away? Not brought him? Found someone else to watch him? I guess I just don't feel good judging this kid or the parents to such a harsh extent based on this post. I just think it's a tough job. If you have more information please share.", ">most of the time\n\nAnd you pulled that statistic out of which hole on your body? You don't know the amount of harm reduction he does behind the scenes. Tbh neither do I, but I would assume no one goes from zero to \"go to Disney after disrespecting your mother and traumatizing your brother\"", "It's very radical of you to cry \"Do better\" when someone does a good thing in a bad system. I'm sure you know about all the instances when OP's dad failed to step up and all the opportunities when he didn't talk to his wife.", "I mean, op clarified that it was her parents, not her disabled brother, who she doesn\u2019t care about, so I no longer feel this way and did not change my NTA vote in my first post to this thread.", "Explain how that excuses her behaviour.", "That\u2019s what I did! My life got significantly better once I went no-contact.", "There's someone further down acting like her experience is the norm and the son is getting a pass because \"boys will be boys\".", "I really can't believe most people are blaming an autistic 9 year old child as much as the parents.", "His behavior is his fault. He chooses his own actions.", "I can agree with most of that. I guess I'm angry for OP because of the standard her brother will be raised at.\n\nI may be an A H myself for thinking this, but I think he needed to hear some form of negativity early on. I don't think the \"You should've never been born!\" Comment is the way but his parents aren't doing him any favors and his sis might've given him and/or his parents a harsh wake-up call.", "One parent should have stayed with him, and the other should stay with her in the park.", "No one claimed it was \"radical\"\n\nI never claimed to have complete knowledge.  \n\nHave any arguments that aren't weird straw men?", "He sounds awful, too. Just because he has autism doesn\u2019t mean that he gets to bully and control the family.", "I don't see anything to excuse in her behaviour. She deserves equal attention from her family, and not having her private life ruined by being babysitter to his brother who seems intent on messing up her life. OP is right for being honest, and if she is feeling the way she does, it's her family's fault, not hers.\n\n>My brother found out that I\u2019m going to Disney and he had a really big melt down. He loves Disney and he was mad that I was going without him.\n\nOP shouldnt have to put up with that. She has a right to live her life too.", "People HATE autistic children tbh. People REALLY want easy answers to things. There are not easy answers when it comes to things like autistic meltdowns, especially when we're dealing with children.", "Yeah, I really don't understand that mindset at all.", "He does what he's been taught works. His parents are to blame.", "Depends on how destructive he is I guess. But if he was that bad then they shouldn't have gone right?"]}
