My dad is rarely home and my mom is always busy with my brother so neither of them have time for me. \n\nI\u2019ve known my best friend \u201cRachel\u201d since we were in kindergarten. Her mom is the nicest person I\u2019ve ever met. Rachel and I played soccer but my mom was rarely able to take me to practices and games so Rachel\u2019s mom would always take me. I used to be in the school choir and my parents went to like one performance during the six years I did it. Rachel\u2019s mom was at every performance for me even though Rachel wasn\u2019t in choir. \n\nThose are just a few examples, but Rachel\u2019s mom has always been there for me when my parents weren\u2019t available. My mom never really cares what I\u2019m doing unless she needs me to watch my brother so I spend a lot of time at Rachel\u2019s house. Once I spent a whole weekend there and my mom didn\u2019t even call to ask where I am. Rachel\u2019s family go on a lot of vacations and they often take me. \n\nThey\u2019re going to Disney World during Thanksgiving break and invited me to come with them. I asked my dad and he said I could go. They\u2019ve already planned and booked everything and I\u2019m really excited. I\u2019ve been to Disneyland once with my family and it was horrible. My brother threw a huge tantrum on the first day because he wanted to go on the rides alone and sit between mom and dad so I had to stay in the hotel most of the time. \n\nMy brother found out that I\u2019m going to Disney and he had a really big melt down. He loves Disney and he was mad that I was going without him. My mom told me that she was planning to go to Washington to visit my grandparents. My dad didn\u2019t say anything about that so I\u2019m pretty sure she just made that up to stop me from going. And even if they are going, I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to go on a fourteen hour car ride with my brother and I\u2019m pretty sure when we get there they\u2019re either going to make me stay with him while they go out or take him out and leave me alone in the hotel (I also wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go out on my own).\n\nShe told me that I need to think about my brother and his feelings are more important because he\u2019s younger and autistic. I told her that I honestly don\u2019t give a f*ck about my brother\u2019s feelings and I wish he was never born. He was there when I said all this and he\u2019s been crying and screaming for the last three hours and it\u2019s giving me a headache. My mom has been trying to calm him down and my dad said that he\u2019ll still let me go because he understands I\u2019m frustrated (he also grew up with a neurodivergent siblings so he knows what it\u2019s like). My mom said that I\u2019m a rude, ungrateful brat and I need to be kinder to my brother. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Idk if this is important but we live in California and went to Disneyland in Anaheim. I\u2019m going to Disney World in Orlando with Rachel\u2019s family. I think my brother does somewhat understand that Disney World has more fun stuff which makes him more. mad. I didn\u2019t tell him anything and I\u2019m pretty sure my dad didn\u2019t either, so either he overheard us talking or my mom told him.\n\nEDIT 2: I was 11 when the Disneyland incident happened. My brother was mostly nonverbal then but when we were about to leave the hotel he started screaming and saying no while pointing at me. My parents calmed him down briefly but when we got on our first ride he started screaming again so my parents told me to go back to the hotel. I snuck out the second day and went on like two rides before I ran into my parents and they told me to back because they didn\u2019t want me to be out there alone.\n\nEDIT 3: I don\u2019t blame my brother for what happened at Disneyland. He was four. I blame my parents for not finding a better way to handle the situation. He was nonverbal at that time but he can talk now. He isn\u2019t high functioning exactly but he does understand what\u2019s going on around him. He has basic life skills but can\u2019t be on his own for very long.", "created_utc": 1691527728, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ltxyl/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_i_dont_give_a_fck/", "score": 7336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anyway, it's not your brother's fault he was born sick, so try to not resent him that much...", "Slight ESH I would have said NTA but saying that in front of your brother was pretty mean.

So I understand your frustration and want to say your feelings are valid, but they should be directed at your mom, not your brother.  He never asked to be born this way or treated the way he his by your mom either. She's not doing him any favors.  Your mom shouldn't neglect you in favor of your brother.

I'm not sure how bad his autism is but your mom seems to potentially over coddle him. \n\nIt seems your dad empathizes with you, so I can only hope that he continues to step in and side with you going on this trip. You have a great friend in Rachel and her family sounds fantastic!", "NTA, OP. Parentification is ABUSE.

It's in facing and getting through circumstances where he doesn't get what he wants, then getting it explained to him in developmentally appropriate terms why he couldn't have it. Including making sure that when one of the reasons is other's people's needs, that's specifically highlighted and he is told that you have to make room for others even when it's hard because it's the right thing to do and it's a way to be nice to people. And taught that even when he can't always do that proactively on his own- which he probably won't be able to, neurologically-when the situations come up where he's told \"this is happening differently because your sister wants X so we're going to compromise, have support each time to understand that it's not about taking something away from him or messing with his plan, which is how he's hard wired to view it, but is about doing the right thing.", "The brother is a young child with a disability--and was a younger one whenever it was that they went to Disney previously--who has terrible parents.

It\u2019s still 100% the parents fault at that age because they have limited access to any other experience. Once they reach middle/high school they can start learning and having different life experiences which hopefully teaches them that they aren\u2019t the center of the universe. However, even at that age sometimes the teaching of the parents over ride the other experiences.

Your dad sounds like he gets where you're coming from and is cool with it, and that's cool. :)\n\nYou *can* teach an autistic child how to handle disappointment, do things they don't want to do, help them adjust to changes in their routine, etc.  They might interface with society differently than the rest of us, but they aren't dumb and and absolutely *should not* be spoiled or given run of the house/family.  They are *incredibly* logical and can be reasoned with.  My kid's on the spectrum, and at 18yo is more level-headed, even-keeled, and better able to handle curve balls than half of the rest of my family who are neurotypical grown-ass adults.\n\nSomething important here, and I absolutely *do not* want you to beat yourself up over this: autistic people know they're different from everyone else, and most of them end up developing depression and/or anxiety going into their teens if not before.\n\nIf you decide you'd like to apologize to your brother at some point (because his condition and how he's currently functioning isn't his fault) in the future, remind him about how there are times he likes having alone time with mom and dad, or go and do fun things, and that you also like that sometimes, but mom and dad sometimes have trouble doing that for you with two kids in the house; that you were mad, upset and hurt the way he was and had a meltdown.\n\n(read: I know that's worded too gently to our ears, but your brother is a 9yo autistic boy who's about to have a body's worth of hormones, probably at least a decade or two of depression, and a hell of a time learning to function through that)\n\nThe point is to explain it to him like you would a toddler, find similarities in actions and reactions, compare them, and explain them to him.

If you decide not to apologize to him, that's ok.  You're 16yo and should never have been shoved aside the way you were.

Your friend's mom sounds like a wonderful person - and it seems like she will continue to be there for you.\n\nIt is awful that your parents don't take your life, wellbeing, safety, and feelings into account when making any decisions. They're setting a bad example for your brother in doing so, too. Obviously he needs accommodations and therefore more intense attention, but PARENTS are the ones responsible for giving those accommodations and attention WITHOUT taking attention from you, or spitefully refusing things.\n\nLife isn't supposed to be this hard, and you did nothing wrong that made it this hard. Try to spend time doing things for YOU and that are beneficial or just happy for YOU. Sounds like maybe Rachel's house is a nice haven and that you're probably welcome there frequently.

You said it as a result of the mistreatment, not vice versa.)\n\nYou are the child. You are the one in need of care. They are the adults. They are responsible for making sure your needs are met, and that includes emotional needs and just showing up for you. If they are unable to do so, they need to find ways to make it happen (i.e. Hiring a home health aide so they can come to one of your games, or otherwise making accommodations so both kids can have your needs met).\n\nSo no.

And also not in every case about the larger social context that may appear to others, but about the immediate problem that is dsitressing them. \n\nFrom inside the higher support needs community, it is absolutely not true that most autistic people can do more tasks than they think but they just aren't encouraged. Most Level 2 or 3 autistic people have the exact opposite life experience. People burn out, which is a medical situation, from trying to act more independent than they can be. At least 1/3 of all autistic people are moderate to high support needs, and their IQ has nothing to do with all the other symptoms affecting their struggle with various tasks and jobs. Autism affects motor coordination in most cases as well as executive function, affects language in many people who are not what's considered 'nonverbal' and has high comorbidity with dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, and ADHD.\n\nI'm not leaving this comment to say something about OP's story. \n\nI just want to clarify that this is possible because I feel this thread is tending toward sweeping generalizations and misinformation based on the current pop culture picture of autism based on tiktok etc and people who all have autism with such low support needs that they participate in normal daily society, work, etc. \n\n Basing your ideas of all autism off of that and making confident pronouncements 'from your experience' that autistic people are highly intelligent and therefore when they have meltdowns due to someone else's behavior upsetting them they are probbaly doing it to get something they want is very concerning and upsetting.\n\nNone of that is to say it just be accepted forever, either. All autistic people, actually *especially* higher support needs people who are diagnosed and receive treatment, are encouraged to work ont hese things. Even higher support needs adults who live in care homes and will never work or traditionally be in society are typically sent to behavioral therapy, btw. By clarifying that it is possible for people to be that disabled, I am NOT saying that it's ok for everyone else to just work around it etc. Everyone of all capabilities should do their best to work to accommodate and respect those around them, including the disabled.\n\n I'm just trying to correct the record on the things everyone is saying/implying about autism in general, that all seem based off the growing stereotype that 'autism' refers to someone mildly socially inept who obviously uses it as excuse and may not even be diagnosed. Because that's not accurate. Seeing you say that \"autistic people\" in general can do more than people think they can, they've just been babied, is very hurtful.", "I hope OP is preparing already for what college she's going to go to because that mother is totally going to expect her to go to the local community college (assuming there is one) rather than go away.

You don\u2019t have one child just so they can raise your pisspoor excuse of one.

I think they\u2019re saying \u201cmild\u201d because they\u2019re capable of reading and writing here on Reddit vs someone with more severe forms of autism wouldn\u2019t be capable of that. \n\nIt\u2019s called a spectrum for a big reason. My brother also has autism and he is 30 and verbal but can barely read and can\u2019t go to the bathroom or eat without constant support and reminders.", "If they know everything, sweetie and Rachael says you're like a sister, ask them about helping get you out. \n\nI had a Rachael, best friends since 6, and I still call her mum mum (we're 32 now). I went through some trouble at home, nothing compared to what you are going through, and they took me in. Before my mum died they tried to get her to give me to them rather than the aunt I ended up with because they knew it would be better for me, unfortunately though my mums family could easily manipulate her and got their way.\n\nTalk to Rachael and her family ask for their help.

Y'all need help.", "You clearly know not a fucking thing about autism. You should probably sit this one out", "IDK why it's so hard for some people to grasp that just because someone is neuro divergent they can't also be an asshole.  I used to spend a lot of time with the special needs kids in my school.  I'm not sure why the school had me do it.   I did have a relative with Downs Syndrome so that might be why.  I was a student chaperone anytime they went on field trips and what 15 year old is going to turn down going to the zoo and getting out of school.   Anyways this one particular \"kid\" was probably 20 or so and he would greet every pretty girl by honking her boobs and saying \"nice to meet you\".  He knew exactly what he was doing. Sometimes the school would ask me to bring another person to help.  I usually chose guys to avoid this but a gf at the time really wanted to go.  Her mom worked with special needs kids in another school so I knew she'd be fine.  Anyways I warned her about the honker and he tried to do it to her and she backed away.  He threw a HUGE fit about how she hates him.  It was a clusterfuck but it finally got them to address the issue in his therapy sessions.", "Yeah honestly they should\u2019ve kept him at the hotel if he was going to be the one to melt down and let OP go to the park.

Mommy and daddy have allowed this is unacceptable behavior to continue because they're using autism as a crutch. Bad behavior needs to be called bad behavior.", "I have what was called Aspergers, which typically presents with hyper-verbosity and hyperlexia. However, I was severe enough that I was able to be diagnosed as a girl in the 90s, which was a rarity. I could speak and read and write, but I couldn\u2019t communicate. I would probably be considered in the moderate/mid-range category today. Since I could speak, it would have pushed me higher than my actual communicative and functional abilities.\n\nI do know that I didn\u2019t understand the concept of a lie until I was 5 or 6. I actually recall the specific incident. I was in therapy from when I was very young until today. I remember being taught to make eye contact and to stop stimming and how to have reciprocal conversations.\n\nWhat\u2019s really changed things was the Arrowsmith program. It changed my brain. I think differently ever since. I can remember how I used to think before Arrowsmith, and it feels completely alien to me.  Which is what the program is supposed to do - rewire the brain - but it\u2019s really weird looking back and recognizing how completely unaware of other people I was. Like night and day.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m still on the Spectrum, I\u2019m now in a completely different place than I once was. I\u2019m pretty close to the cut off, from what I understand, and my biggest problems these days are sensory and executive function. But it took my entire childhood working on it to get there.", "As someone who has always felt like a burden, that\u2019s how I think I would have and did perceive it. At the same time, I understood that they definitely meant well, but what you\u2019ve just explained sounds very probable", "I concur, and also promise, you are not a burden.  I birthed two sons,  I have four.  They are grown men now, in their early 30\u2019s.  They are my oldest son\u2019s chosen brothers, and defacto older brothers to my 7 years younger son.  Neither one of them had good home lives, to say the least, and both of them lived with us, on and off, throughout middle and high school.  By the time they were getting ready to move away they both lived with us for an extended period.  I will ALWAYS BE MOM to all of my boys, including my three handsome grandsons.  They know they can call me anytime and I will be there, if they are close enough I will drive there.  I\u2019m close with my youngest sons best friends too, don\u2019t get me wrong.  Thankfully, they did not have broken home lives.  We still took some of them on vacation with us a time or two even and all of them loved spending weekends when they were old enough to.   We are just meant to connect with people that are there to help us, because, they truly want to do so.  You are blessed to have them and I am glad they have been there for you through the years.  I just know in my heart they will continue to do so long after you are fully grown.  I wish you much luck and hope you have a blast at Disney!  \nOne more thing!  You are definitely NTA", "Not disagreeing but pointing out that at the time of the disaster Disney trip, OP wasn\u2019t a teenager - she was eleven. That makes it even more unacceptable. The solution should never have been sending her back to the hotel - if nothing else, it should have been the parents each took one child. My heart breaks for OP, and the level of bitterness is completely understandable I think. Whatever her brother\u2019s level of function, whether her parents are doing right by him or not, they have completely failed their other child.", "At that point, he should have been taken back to the hotel and dealt with the fallout there while OP could continue the day with one of the parents, instead of caving into the demands of a petulant toddler. \n\nHe threw a tantrum because he wanted to hog the parents attention. They gave in. And now look where they are?", "That's so sweet of you to take care of those boys. All kids need a person like you in their lives.", "Yes. \n\nI'm not sure how to respond though when people keep repeating this in response to every comment that says anything forgiving toward OP's brother, even though it's the most universal and supported opinion I've seen on AITA in a while. It feels almost like what-about-ism. \n\nI don't know what I'm supposed to say or if I'd be getting these replies if I had more emphatically talked for longer about how OP has been treated awfully.  The reason I didn't do that is just because it's been done, as has the parent bashing, whereas in relation to her brother, mostly just misinformation about autism is being spread which is becoming concerning. I haven't seen a single comment empathizing with OP's brother that doesn't have multiple responses reminding everybody that OP has a right to be angry while barely being related to the comment about the brother they're responding to. It's getting weird.", "Yeah, both those things can be true. \n\nSo much of this comment thread is people acting like they can't. Someone speaks n defense of one sibling, and another commenter comes in with 'what aboutism'. It's very sad to see. \n\nIt's exactly what people like OP's parents cause.\n\nI also feel it's mostly slanted toward reacting dramatically in defense of OP as though it's needed any time anyone points out where OP's brother might not be an evil little con artist and the things she's describing fit his age and autism in many cases even if he's also overindulged.", "Time to file for emancipated teen status, if possible, and ask Rachel and her family if they can 'rent' a room to her to prove she is able to provide for herself", "Right? OP\u2019s bio-parents would have to surrender their parental rights before Rachel\u2019s parents could adopt her.", "He was mostly nonverbal at the time- but he was also only 4. It\u2019s not clear how he is as a 9 year old. \n\nBut their parents are disgusting. How cruel to take a child to Disneyland and then make them stay in the hotel room because the preschooler doesn\u2019t want them to come! No. If one kid is tantrumming, then that kid stays back with a parent and the other parent takes the well behaved kid to the park. When struggling child calms down, the parent with him can catch up or they can divide and conquer for the day.", "I'm leaning on blaming the parents - if OP's account is accurate, they are abusing her.\n\nIf they already abuse one child, why not another?", ">I didn\u2019t even have normal teenage years cuz I spent so much of it taking care of my brother.\n\nThen it's 100% reasonable for OP to absolutely not want that for herself. You must see how literally anybody reading that could only take it as a life changing negative.", "I hope you\u2019re right but I don\u2019t think the courts will take her seriously.

A minor adoption when OP has two living, non-CPS-involved parents? They would get laughed out of court.", "It would never make it to family court. You don't just tromp in and say my home life sucks so I want these other people to adopt me.. Her only course of action is to pursue emancipation. At 16 the court is likely to grant it particularly under these circumstances but best advice would be for her to consult with a lawyer.", "I wouldnt give too much credit to not knowing where she is for a weekend. She spends 90% of her time at one place, they knew she was there. They also could have the ability to ping the phones location.", "There would be financial advantages to that when it comes to college.  \n\n\nNTA by the way.

Especially when the case isn\u2019t especially good. OP apparently has food, shelter, clothing; she doesn\u2019t say any of her basic material needs are going unmet. She\u2019s not being physically abused, and no court is going to emancipate a minor because they sometimes have to babysit their brother.  Moreover, she would need to be living elsewhere, without objection from her parents, and have the ability to pay her own bills. \n\nOP\u2019s situation sucks, but she\u2019s already 16. She needs to plan to GTFO on her 18th birthday and focus her efforts on that, not an emancipation petition that won\u2019t be granted.", "Normally emancipation requires that the minor have proof of being able to support themself.", "I've done a few emancipation cases, they're not easy. You have to have a job, show you're earning enough to be self supporting, have an apartment, etc. \n\nIt's a difficult hoop to jump through, much less at 16.", "I wonder if OP could pursue emancipation and live with Rachel as an independent. They are 100% neglecting and emotionally abusing her in favor of their other kid. She\u2019s a live in nanny at this point", "Yeah it's a pretty stupid idea. If there was real abuse (I mean from a legal standpoint, the op is definitely facing abuse) then it's possible but still not a sure thing"]}
