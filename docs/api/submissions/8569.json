Both my parents are Indian so even though my race is Iranian I feel more Indian by culture and tradition and identify my ethnicity as Indian.\n\nThere are very little POCs in my school (maybe 20 out of 400 students) so me and one other girl, lets call her A, are the only Iranis in our school. We met when A moved across the street from me when we were 6 and now were both in highschool. We instantly became best friends. She has always respected my decision to identify as Indian and we teach each other bits of Hindi and Farsi (Irani language) over the years.\n\nA's mom is very traditional, to the point where she's against burning hijabs in the recent protests. She sees me as family now so she even goes as far to not bother putting her hijab back on when I'm around. (Women who wear the hijab religiously are supposed to wear the hijab in the presence of anyone who isn't close family) She has gently shown me many parts of Iran's culture as I've grown up, and never tries to negate me calling myself Indian.

She mainly watches TV for most of the day, only she doesn't react to jokes or sad parts like she used to. She doesn't eat more than a couple bites, and I have to coax her to speak more than 2-word replies. Some of the tears I've cried are not just for A's dad but for A. I know time will help, but it just seems hopeless right now.\n\nTwo days ago A's mom gave me a box with a dress and a hijab to wear for the funeral. I thanked her but started to give the hijab back when she told me that I will have to wear the hijab during the funeral. I asked her why, and she said: \"I tolerate that you think you're not from Iran. I allow it in my home. But you are, and I will not allow disrespect during my husbands funeral.\" She's never said anything like that before, and I was so taken aback that I apologized and took the hijab and left. But I do not feel muslim and have not for any part of my life, and because of this I'm thinking of not wearing it. It just doesn't feel right to wear a hijab when its not a part of my religion. I don't want to get A caught in the middle of a fight in her state, though, so I don't know what to do. AITA if I don't wear it next week?\n\nEdit: I feel obligated to mention that others who are not muslim are not expected to wear one, including my parents, even though the funeral is in a mosque.

I'm not Muslim and I'm not from an Arabic nation but when I am invited by Muslim people into their space I wear hijab out of respect. They know I'm not Muslim, but they appreciate the gesture of respect. Your friend family has suffered a devastating loss. Don't make their occasion to gather and grieve about you.

Offer to dress modestly as anyone should at funerals. And, if it is required for ALL women to do so, cover your hair.  If required, hair covering could be a scarf or a hat, not hijab.\n\nYou could also check the dress code with that particular venue (I did not see that it is a mosque, it could be just a graveyard, or else).

It is respect for THEIR religion that they are permittinbg me to be a part of.   I want to visit Hagia Sofia because it is a living museum that started under the Eastern Christians, and then became a Mosque later on.\n\nSo, if you plan to go to the funeral, you need to dress as they desire you dress.", "NTA.

I have very close friends who are Pakistani.  Very liberal, but like most South Asians, fairly religious and I have attended a good amount of religious ceremonies at their homes.  Nobody has ever forced me to cover my head, but I have at times out of respect and depending on the context.  For instance, smaller religious ceremonies (like for babies), I may not cover my head. But I do at ceremonies (including funerals) that are connected to a death in the family.

Specifically because other non muslims won\u2019t be wearing one there\u2019s no reason you should be singled out because she thinks your religion should be what hers is.", "NTA If you attend a Muslim funeral with women wearing Hijabs, then you should wear one too, out of respect for both their religious beliefs and the formality of the event. Basically, the event has a dress code. (However, if your female relatives are going to the funeral with you, without Hijab, then you shouldn't be made to wear it.) But otherwise elsewhere, you do not need to wear a Hijab, as that is basically forcing you into going against your own beliefs.", "NTA. I understand that your friend\u2019s mother is grieving but she is essentially saying that your parents aren\u2019t your real parents by insisting only you wear the hijab due to your birth culture. \n\nMaybe at a more appropriate time it would make sense for your parents to reinforce boundaries and how you identify.", "NTA \n\nYou are being singled out, which is unacceptable. A's mom had obviously always thought that you would return to your \"true\" heritage.", "Most (all) Persians I know don\u2019t wear hijabs and not even during funerals. So this is definitely interesting to me. Imo NTA, but I would probably do it as a sign of respect not necessarily out of religious respect. I would try see it in the same way as how you often dress more modestly in schools / workplaces which isn\u2019t done out of religious reasons. But at the end of the day it is was you\u2019re comfortable with.", "Info: I know non Muslims aren\u2019t expected to wear a hijab, but what does your mum think? Is there a traditional Indian headcovering you both (your mum & you) could wear as a way to not cause conflict with your friends mum but also respect your upbringing?", "NTA. It\u2019s completely out of line and rude for her to expect you to wear hijab just because she thinks you should. Others aren\u2019t forced to, it\u2019s not a rule of the mosque, she has no right to force her religion on you. This is the literal definition of forcing her religion on you in the form of a headpiece.", "I hate wearing a suit just freaking hate it\nBut out of respect for certain situations, I wear them to funerals , weddings, anniversary parties \nWhat you wear does not define who you are", "NTA I am deeply sympathetic to your friends mum, grief is  monstrous, but what she said to you isn't okay. You aren't muslim and you don't identify as Iranian. I am sorry she's put you in such a tough position.", "I won't judge, but I am Christian raised atheist, and unser these circumstances I would wear it. \nIt is about being there for them and nothing else.", "NTA - and she does not expect non Muslims to wear it so it\u2019s offensive to expect you to. And imply that you\u2019re wrong for not doing so.\n\nThat said the woman\u2019s just lost her husband and your friend their father. You\u2019ll never look at that woman the same way as she\u2019s shown who she is.\n\nBut you really should be checking in with  A - if she cares if you wear a hijab or not if you attend the funeral or if you can decline to attend without causing her hurt. And if she doesn\u2019t want to engage either way - she\u2019s grieving, this is not an issue for her she has enough going on which is fair.\n\nThe mam is being an AH - but causing an issue at A dads funeral is not the way to address that. Reddit is probably not the place to be seeking advice - go to your folks about how to handle this.", "This would be true if she was expecting every woman to wear a hijab. OP mentions she expects that only for Muslim women, and her. I think that's an issue. \n\nI wouldn't think it's an issue if every woman wore it. I visited a synagogue, and wore a kippa, I remove my sis before entering a mosque or a Buddhist temple, all of this is normal.", "So forcing religion on another person is acceptable to you?", "It is NOT: because all others, even OP's mom - is NOT expected to wear one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it is NOT a general sign of respect, but singling OP out.", "Fully understand the mother IS grieving but she cannot take it on a high schooler who isn't even her own daughter.", "You love your friend, do this once for your friend. I know you don\u2019t consider yourself this, but it would show show much gratitude and respect for her family. \n\nEdit her to your", "Yeah, agreed. OP is NTA as other guests aren't being asked to wear it, but the phrase \"pick your battles\" comes to mind. I would make the concession to be there for my friend in this instance.", "also why does op think muslim women cover in front of everyone but close family?", "Definitely talk to her mom and dad.  She needs adult support here.", "But the family has no issue with women attending the funeral with uncovered hair. OP is the *only* person being told she has to wear a hijab.", "Traditionally, however, just as one respects other religions, OPs mother would at the very least be expected to cover her hair when entering a mosque or gurudwara. It's what we do in India as well as here in the US. A lot of Hindus also cover their hair when inside the temple. So giving them this grace isn't a big deal, at this time. However, if it continues  absolutely say something and maybe involve the parents so there isn't a unfair power dynamic of adult vs child.", "It's not even about her parents. She could have been raised by her birth parents and decided that she isn't a Muslim, and/or doesn't want to wear the hijab. The friends mother had just old traditional views and wants to impose them. That sucks, OP will lose either way", "\"It's part of the dress code for a religious service and\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is NOT. OP's mom is NOT expected to wear a Hijab, and the otehr guests are not expected to do it either. .... it is JUST OP being singled out.", "Exactly. There is a very clear meaning behind the demand and that is what OP has an issue with, it isn't about a piece of cloth.\n\nI'm sure if the mother had said \"please can you wear a green ribbon to the funeral as it was my husband's favourite colour\" OP wouldn't have an issue but with her demand about the hijab what the mother is saying is I don't accept your choices regarding your own identity/heritage. I've decided that you are Iranian/Muslim and *you* need to conform to *my* beliefs regarding *your* identity.", "The mother cares more about forcing *one specific* girl to conform to a religion that she does not identify with than mourning her husband.\n\nNo other guests are being asked to wear a hijab to the funeral.", "I think that was added after I made my comment. I did not know it was only her.", "I think that was added after I made my comment. That changes everything.", "Amen to that. OP is in a hard position if the mother makes supporting her friend conditional on compliance. Let's hope it won't go that way.", "I still think OP should talk about it with her friend and the mother some months after the funeral when everyone can have a calm conversation. Her friend is too distraught to eat, and her mother is probably not in her right mind. I don\u2019t understand why OP cannot let this slide this one time and just do this for her friend\u2019s mother in their time of great tragedy.\n\nAnd after seeing everyone at the funeral, OP will also have some idea of what is expected of non-Muslims in attendance to provide some basis supporting her argument.", "No", "I understand why that might seem like a reasonable compromise but for me it doesn't work because this is not about respecting someone else's religious beliefs since the friend's mum has no issue with anyone other than OP wearing a hijab.\n\nBasically it boils down to friend's mum fundamentally rejecting OP's identity. OP does not identify as Iranian or Muslim and the mum is saying I don't care if you think you're Iranian/Muslim I do so you have to conform *your* identity to how I think you should. For me that is not something I could just let slide.\n\nIt's no different than if OP was trans and their friends mum was saying \"I tolerate that you think you're not a girl. I allow it in my home. But you are and I won't allow disrespect during my husband's funeral\" and insisted OP wear a dress and present as female for the funeral. It is OP's fundamental right to determine their own identity, whether that is culture, religion or gender.\n\nI agree OP should talk to her friend and their mum but she should do so now and explain why the mums behaviour is unacceptable and why she can't attend the funeral under those demands.\n\nTLDR: losing a loved one does not give someone the right to be a bigot.", "Yes. My swipe keyboard hates me and wants me to look silly. Sigh."]}
