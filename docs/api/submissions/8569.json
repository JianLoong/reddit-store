I was adopted when I was an infant by their best friends, my very loving parents. Both my parents are Indian so even though my race is Iranian I feel more Indian by culture and tradition and identify my ethnicity as Indian.\n\nThere are very little POCs in my school (maybe 20 out of 400 students) so me and one other girl, lets call her A, are the only Iranis in our school. We met when A moved across the street from me when we were 6 and now were both in highschool. We instantly became best friends. She has always respected my decision to identify as Indian and we teach each other bits of Hindi and Farsi (Irani language) over the years.\n\nA's mom is very traditional, to the point where she's against burning hijabs in the recent protests. She sees me as family now so she even goes as far to not bother putting her hijab back on when I'm around. (Women who wear the hijab religiously are supposed to wear the hijab in the presence of anyone who isn't close family) She has gently shown me many parts of Iran's culture as I've grown up, and never tries to negate me calling myself Indian. When I turned 13, though, she gave me a hijab. As I started to explain that I didn't want to wear a hijab she apologized, but told me to keep it \"just in case.\"\n\nA's dad almost 2 weeks ago. The funeral is in one week. I've done my best to help A in any way I can, but it's affected her so much. She was energetic and full of life and always trying to find the positive but now she's just empty. She mainly watches TV for most of the day, only she doesn't react to jokes or sad parts like she used to. She doesn't eat more than a couple bites, and I have to coax her to speak more than 2-word replies. Some of the tears I've cried are not just for A's dad but for A. I know time will help, but it just seems hopeless right now.\n\nTwo days ago A's mom gave me a box with a dress and a hijab to wear for the funeral. I thanked her but started to give the hijab back when she told me that I will have to wear the hijab during the funeral. I asked her why, and she said: \"I tolerate that you think you're not from Iran. I allow it in my home. But you are, and I will not allow disrespect during my husbands funeral.\" She's never said anything like that before, and I was so taken aback that I apologized and took the hijab and left. But I do not feel muslim and have not for any part of my life, and because of this I'm thinking of not wearing it. It just doesn't feel right to wear a hijab when its not a part of my religion. I don't want to get A caught in the middle of a fight in her state, though, so I don't know what to do. AITA if I don't wear it next week?\n\nEdit: I feel obligated to mention that others who are not muslim are not expected to wear one, including my parents, even though the funeral is in a mosque. As most of the comments are saying to either go to the funeral and wear the hijab or don't go to the funeral at all, I'm deciding to go to the funeral with the hijab, but to not ever wear one again.

They know I'm not Muslim, but they appreciate the gesture of respect. Your friend family has suffered a devastating loss. Don't make their occasion to gather and grieve about you.

Offer to dress modestly as anyone should at funerals. And, if it is required for ALL women to do so, cover your hair.  If required, hair covering could be a scarf or a hat, not hijab.\n\nYou could also check the dress code with that particular venue (I did not see that it is a mosque, it could be just a graveyard, or else).

It is respect for THEIR religion that they are permittinbg me to be a part of.   I want to visit Hagia Sofia because it is a living museum that started under the Eastern Christians, and then became a Mosque later on.\n\nSo, if you plan to go to the funeral, you need to dress as they desire you dress.", "NTA.

All the women had their heads covered.  Why any non-Muslim would even want to come to a Muslim funeral prayer service is beyond me, since they wouldn\u2019t know how to pray, but if they had, yes, it would have been vulgar and crass for them to not be dressed appropriately at a Muslim FUNERAL PRAYER SERVICE.\n\n> you feel fine FORCING someone to wear part of YOUR religious clothing even though they do not prescribe to it\n\nGuess what?  If you can\u2019t dress appropriately for a funeral, I don\u2019t want you there.  Simple as that.  And yes, if you\u2019re a woman, and it\u2019s a Muslim funeral, that means covering your head.  If that bothers you so much, no one is forcing you to go.  I\u2019m not forcing anyone to do anything.\n\n> So those who dress modestly but not per your expectations are vulgar?\n\nWhen it means you *purposely* don\u2019t respect the dress code yes, it\u2019s vulgar.  \u201cModestly\u201d can mean anything.  There are bathing suits that are described as \u201cmodest\u201d.  Some people think a knee-high skirt is \u201cmodest\u201d.  Others think a sleeveless maxi dress is \u201cmodest\u201d.
