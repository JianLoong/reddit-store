But if she wanted it she should buy it for herself.\n\nNow I'm not cheap, she does get gifts from me. Xmas, birthdays, date nights, anniversary, Valentines day exc... I pay for all that.\n\nBut the random $300-$400 shoes when she has plenty, not in my budget.\n\nShe does pay her own phone bill and we split the home expenses.\n\nThe purpose for the AITA post, is her finding out how much I've been sending my parents each month. That being $500-$1000 each month.\n\nThey're both on a form of SSI, and because they are married they each only get half what they should be getting. They both worked most of their lives, both can no longer work. With life as it is now, for the past few years I've been helping them.\n\nShe knew this, just not how much. She expected $100-$200 a month. She found out when our take out guy/girl called us do to a mess up in our order. I was busy so she answered my phone. After hanging up she backed out of the phone app and my bank app was still open. I guess her curiosity got the best of her because she decided to start scrolling and found my most recent payment to my parents.\n\nShe asked why I needed to send them so much and after a rough talk. She found out how much I've been sending. She didn't like the fact that I could afford to send all that to them but not buy her \"insert random thing\" she wanted.\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to her buying me gifts for Xmas, birthdays, date nights, anniversary, Valentines day exc. She doesn't. To her, girls don't buy gifts for their guys. \"She's the gift\" Her words.\n\nShe'll occasionally buy me little things, nothing more then a few dollars at a time.\n\nAgain, she has her own full time job. We both get up in the morning and got to work. We both take care of the apartment. We take turns cooking, each being better at cooking something than the other.\n\nBut back to her issue with my money, she wasn't happy at all. Got on my case about being financially abusive and a bad boy friend because I don't drop hundreds if dollars on her on a whim. When I told her that she makes just as much as I do and that we split finances equally and that she should have plenty to spoil herself with. She got testy and told me that it was different. That's HER money and it was MY JOB to take care of her. I am taking care of her, just not dropping money on things neither of us needs.\n\nI knew from past experiences that she'd get moody when I didn't buy her expensive things, but until recently I never seen her flip over money that wasn't hers.

She doesn't buy you gifts because girls don't buy guys gifts?!? That is an entire load of BS and just tells me she is selfish and does not appreciate you. She sounds like a self-centered materialistic hag. I'm sorry but she is taking you for granted. Expecting you to buy her things just because she wants them and then not reciprocating is just disrespectful. \n\nHealthy relationships should be equal with both partners spoiling each other, regardless of gender. You should want to show your partner that they are special whether that be physical gifts or just doing something for them that they love. I love buying my husband gifts for Christmas and his birthday. It makes me happy to know that when he opens it his eyes will light up and his excitement is contagious. I even enjoy getting him little surprises if I am out running errands just like a new candy bar or new drink I thought he would like to try. He always rubs my back when I've had a rough day or will wash my hair for me because a scalp rub is incredible. \n\nAs for her snooping into your bank account I can't even fathom why that would be okay. I've been married 10 years  and have never looked into his personal bank accounts. We have a joint account for shared stuff but his personal is just that, personal. (And he's never given me a reason to worry). Her being upset that you're helping your parents with money is alarming. I could understand if she was concerned if you were taking food off your table or short on your household bills and wanted to discuss a plan but to say you should have bought her something instead of\n giving your parents money. I'm sure with such a limited income of SSI they could really use it for utilities,  food, or meds. We all know that when elderly parents are tight on funds they'll start rationing their medications or not even fill them. I would hate for you to find out they have been going without not to mention dangerous all because she wanted another pair of shoes or a new purse.  It makes me wonder what your parents think of her or how she treats them. \n\nI really hope you keep all your finances separate because it  is time to get her out of your life. Your GF is replaceable, your parents are not.  There are plenty of women that would find it honorable that you help your parents would enjoy taking care of you, spoiling you, and appreciate you for you, not for what you buy.", "Dude she also went into your banking app without permission. You have separate finances. As long as you cover your responsibilities it\u2019s none of her business. The fact she hoards her money and expects you to buy her stuff all the time and is so far up her own ass calling her presence your gift shows how little she respects you or your autonomy. \n\nThis girl is something. Either way, it\u2019s something you need to get out of your life. If you don\u2019t like it now how is it going to be if you have kids? She already feels entitled to your money and doesn\u2019t respect you. Please for the sake of your future self run.\n\nRUN!\n\nEdit: spelling and clarity.", "Wow!!

NTA.", "[removed]", "I'd never stay with someone sending their parents $500-1000 a month, WE should be the priority not parents or anyone else, but your girlfriend's complaints are coming from a place of entitlement, she's only worried about how much she's \"missing out\" on, as opposed to the two of you as a team.
