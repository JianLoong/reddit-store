My\nMom had my sister and I at 18 and 21 and had my brothers at 22 and 24. My sister had her kids at 16,18, 20, 22, and, 24, same with aunts and cousins. Tbh I think it\u2019s family pressure that does it because I went to college and have been nagged ever since to start having kids. I\u2019m the fun aunt but also considered a spinster because I\u2019m the only one without kids despite being married. My family all make fun of me for going to college but that doesn\u2019t stop them asking for money. I didn\u2019t have a graduation party, but my sister and SILs have had expensive and lavish baby showers thrown by my parents. We\u2019re talking 100+ guests, personal shoppers, trips and \u201cbabymoons\u201d paid for all three times, expensive jewelry and one of a kind \u201cmothers rings\u201d made. My family puts an unhealthy amount of emphasis on motherhood and since I have a high paying job and no kids, I\u2019m usually asked to \u201cchip in\u201d a significant amount. I don\u2019t do that anymore, but I was a sucker early on. \n\nMy husband (37m) and I decided we\u2019re happy being child-free and are not exploring egg retrieval or surrogacy. Because our wedding coincided with a cousin\u2019s baby shower and we we\u2019re already in our 30s, my mom and sister didn\u2019t come but instead went to my cousin\u2019s baby shower. \n\nLast month a friend gave me the idea to throw my own hysterectomy shower and she and I have been planning it. I invited only people I knew would be comfortable there/think it was funny like my close friends and their spouses, my godmother, and my very supportive in-laws. \n\nMy mom and sister are mad at me for having a hysterectomy and not preserving my fertility and blew a gasket when they found out about my shower, saying it\u2019s offensive to the \u201creal women\u201d in our family. I told her being obsessed with babies and pregnancy isn\u2019t normal and that I sincerely hope they don\u2019t urge my nieces into teen pregnancies like she did my sister. She called me an AH for \u201cruining her dream of being a grandmother\u201d and for being \u201cdisgusting\u201d (she has nine, 5 from my sister and 4 from my brothers).", "created_utc": 1668981713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0gpmo/aita_for_throwing_myself_a_hysterectomy_shower/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope you have a lovely anti-baby shower.", "NTA the fact that they didn\u2019t come to your wedding would make me go low/no contact with them", "NTA I had a no baby baby shower after my hysterectomy it was so fun all my friends participated and brought non kid friendly gifts like alcohol and sharp objects. I did invitations, cake the whole nine yards everyone had a great time. Your decision to do what is right for your body is no one\u2019s business and your fertility or decision to have children is yours alone.", "NTA!! This is absolutely brilliant!!!! Please post an update on how the hysterectomy shower went! Tbh I may totally steal this idea! \nBtw your mom and sisters are absolutely insane and have so much internalized misogyny it\u2019s sad, glad you are getting away from it!", "Definitely NTA and your mom and sister seem bat shit insane", "> offensive to the \u201creal women\u201d\n\nGAAAAH! I almost reflexively downvoted when I read that part. Please downvote your mom for me.\n\nNTA, and congratulations!", "NTA, it\u2019s your body and your choice, and to be honest I\u2019d be cutting off anyone who thought that my value as a reproductive vessel was more important than my health and happiness. \n\nWhat awful self esteem they must have if their only self-worth comes from their ability to propagate their DNA.", "NTA they don't have to attend your shower. Your body, your choice end of.", "NTA. My jaw dropped that your mother and sister went to a baby shower instead  of your wedding! In what universe does a baby shower trump a wedding? They are huge AHs. Btw, a hysterectomy party sounds hilarious and I would definitely attend! I'd probably bring a very nice piece of glass artwork that you could only display in your childfree home.", "Tell your mom that if she believes all women are just meant to have babies that she should go back to the 1950s.\n\nNTA", "Hold up -- NTA Your mother & sister attended a baby shower instead of your wedding. Embrace what makes you and your hubby happy and complete. Continue to create party themes that reflect what YOU want to celebrate. Congrats on a future without the physical pain you have endured for years.", "NTA.\n\n>it\u2019s offensive to the \u201creal women\u201d in our family\n\nYeah, if they don't see that tying whether or not you get to call yourself a woman to whether you're capable of getting knocked up (much less interested in doing so) is *infinitely* more offensive than what sounds like a super-fun party, forget them.  Congrats on your new pain-free - and hopefully soon to also be pain-in-the-butt-free - life!", "NTA.  It's a fantastic idea and I'm glad you have such a supportive husband and inlaws. Technically your side of the family really ought to chip in and buy you nice presents to make up for all the ones you bought them over the years. Can't see that happening though.", "NTA but your family members definitely are", "NTA.  Good for you!  You're owning this decision in a way that is empowering as well as stigma reducing.  If a well known model can put on social media pictures of herself, after a pregnancy gone bad; you most certainly should be able to celebrate the end of a painful period (pun intended) in your life.  Go forth and live a pain free as well as shame free life.", "NTA. You do you. Don't feud with your mother and sister: just keep inviting them for the good time and assume they will come.", "NTA, she can mind her damn business", "Definitely NTA.

Like you called her out\u2014she\u2019s obsessed with babies, but when those babies grow up into adults and decide not to have babies, then the adults are \u201cdisgusting.\u201d So if a woman doesn\u2019t want to be a perpetual incubator, then she\u2019s not a \u201creal\u201d woman. \n\nOP, I\u2019m a petty person and I\u2019m practically begging you to please hire a videographer or photographer for your hysterectomy shower and go crazy with posting pictures online. Post about how you enjoyed sleeping in on your days off and how relaxing it is. Go on vacations that would be impossible to take children on. Show your family that you\u2019re happy and thriving. Your mom & sister can stay back home raising all the annoying kids they want with no free time or disposal income.

You are a magical beautiful unicorn! Anyone who doesn\u2019t see that can feel free to shut their mouth & fuck off! Hope you have an amazing shower!", "NTA. I recently had a bisalp and I was tempted to threw a party myself as a farewell to my tubes.\n\nOur inability to reproduce, whether through voluntary sterilization or otherwise, does not define our \u201crealness\u201d as women. Nor does wanting or not wanting kids. Your mom and sister are the AHs.", "NTA.  I'd suggest not inviting your mom or sister to the shower.  Have a great time!", "NTA but your family sure are the AHs. A hysterectomy shower is hilarious and I hope you have/had a blast! Totally worth celebrating your impending freedom from pain!", "They skipped your wedding for a cousins baby shower lol. They are the worst. NTA, enjoy your party. Maybe if you want to be petty ask them to send some money.", "NTA!!! I don\u2019t see the difference in this and a divorce party. Whatever makes you happy.", "NTA and good for you. These people you are related to sound foul.", "NTA, what *is* offensive is your family implying you\u2019re not a real woman anymore because your life isn\u2019t ruined by having a uterus. Hardly veiled transphobia and intersexphobia, they make everything about them so you can do whatever the fuck you want to do.", "NTA. \n\nI finally managed to get my total hysterectomy after I had my two boys. \n\nThe one and only aunt I still spoke to sent me a condolence card lol. I somewhat get it, I really do. Children are great. I love my boys and I am glad I have them. They grew up to be amazing men. \n\nBut that is me. You are you. They are idiots.\n\nDidn't have a shower, but I did celebrate with a spa day. You have the celebration you want, and tell all these baby obsessed yoyos to stuff it. They have plenty of children between them already!", "NTA if I finally got mine removed I'd celebrate too. Enjoy your lack of pain. Your family is acting so entitled to.. Your body.", "NTA your family are gross. \"Real women\" know their job isn't just about their ability to have children. From a real women who may not be able to have kids.", "NTA. I did the same for myself and it was a blast. We played pin the pad on the panties and had a \"pull the string piniata\". We made one shaped like a uterus and we used a plastic lid to close it. Everyone got to pull a string and one was attached to pull the lid out of the bottom and release a flood of all red candies. Celebrate your body in whatever way you like.", "Good for you! Another childless woman here and I did and do enjoy being the aunt. Luckily, I've never been given any grief about it by my family. NTA.", "NTA. You get to celebrate what is important to you. The people around you should be happy you are happy. Having kids is great. Not having kids is also great. It just comes down to what you want out of life and as long as you are working towards a future that makes you happy, that is what is important.", "NTA AT ALL - Please have a fabulous party!!! - can I get an invite???", "NTA! I wish I would have thought of that!", "NTA\n\nGonna be honest, I'm going to have nightmares about your family.  That kind of baby obsession always gives me the heebie-jeebies.", "NTA. \n\nBut unfortunately some people have strong reactions to these situations. It is your life and you have every right to make this decision and celebrate a life without pain. \n\nThat being said it is impossible to dictate how everyone will react including family. Try to understand where they are coming from and give them time to process. This shouldn\u2019t be a dividing thing for life, and with time they will come around to respect your decisions. Make sure they know that you couldn\u2019t continue with the discomfort, of course. Good luck and hope it all works out!!", "ESH. Your mother is way out of line.
