I always wash after touching a toilet, more out of relfex than anything else.\n\nFrankly though you know she's a germaphobe and unless she's hidden it from you, you're going to need to be careful here and step up your hygene to make her happy. Perhaps getting her professional help but  a little germ phobia is good for life, especially in recent years. \n\nSee also mythbusters episode on toilet flushing and how far the toilet really splatters.", "NTA - Your GF is the person with the problem and she is expecting you to accommodate the problem. She needs to find a solution within her control. I do see a kernel of logic in what she is saying, but even if you are dirtying the shower handle by touching it with unclean hands. However, she is ignoring that she can clean her hands immediately after touching the shower handle. Notice how that solution is logical, accommodates her cleanliness needs, but keeps the burden on her to resolve her own issue since she is the one with the problem.", "NTA- we could all spend countless hours dissecting how/where germs get spread and who is right or wrong. The bigger question is how is your girlfriend\u2019s OCD impacting your relationship as a whole? If you\u2019re able to have respectful conversations and both make compromises then I\u2019d let this go. If not then I\u2019d do some serious thinking about if the relationship is worth it.", "NTA. The purpose of taking a shower is to get clean. Makes no sense wasting resources to wash hands first", "NTA. Her request didn't make logical sense. The toilet tank is just a storage for water BEFORE it is used in the toilet.

I hope she puts the same effort in to getting along with you.", "You\u2019re not the asshole for getting annoyed\u2026but you did touch a toilet, and those things are nasty\u2026no matter where you\u2019re touching them. I don\u2019t know if toilet hands was the battle to pick.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is a very strange lady", "NTA. She needs care from a professional.", "As a former germaphobe: NTA, at all.\n\nYour girlfriend being a germaphobe is now not just impacting her own life, but yours as well. She needs help as soon as possible. Germaphobia can very quickly turn debilitating and can ruin relationships and families. She -needs- to deal with this.\n\nYou have every right to be annoyed. I suggest approaching this subject again at a time where she is sufficiently calm and explain to her the fact that she made an unreasonable and most of all illogical request and the line has to be drawn somewhere. Explain her this situation:\n\n\\- You touched two things with separate hands. The first is inside the tank of the toilet. The place where the same water from the faucet (and the shower for that matter) is in, it comes from the exact same pipe, it doesn't \"sit\" long enough to properly grow bacteria that are harmful. The second is the toilet handle. A place that she, no doubt, regularly and rigorously cleans. Also not a place where bacteria that are harmful grow.\n\n\\- Say you honored her request, you turn on the faucet, now the faucet is unclean, you touched the faucet just as much as you would the shower handle.\n\n\\- You then wash your hands, turn off the faucet, but now your hands need washing again because you touched the faucet that you touched with your non-clean hands.\n\n\\- And subsequently, the same now unclean hands will still touch the same shower handle.\n\nIn short, the \"problem\" wasn't resolved, it was just shifted.\n\nWhat I **strongly** recommend is that you keep talking with your girlfriend about her phobia. Show her scientific articles about bacteria, germs and the fact that most every day germs are beneficial to building a good resistance for your body. Talk to her about where her fear comes from, what she feels is the benefit of her aversion of germs, what her goal is by avoiding germs at all costs. Let her know the health risks of germaphobia, the impact it will have on the future (no kids of her own and not around any kids of friends or family because kids are walking germ factories, no social life, never eating out, never ordering in, spending most of her day needing to clean, never a second of calm and serenity, problems keeping any form of relationship because people simply cannot consistently deal with impossible requests nor should they, anxiety, depression, scrubbing till skin comes off, no longer being able to bear going outside, etc etc etc.\n\nGermaphobia is not something that's static, it will grow and grow over time and eat her up. I sincerely hope she will take the advise of a former germaphobe and seek help. It's scary, but she absolutely **\\*knows\\*** what she does is illogical and hopefully she will seek the help she needs before it debilitates her and everyone around her.", "NTA  - but I get why she wanted you to wash your hands. The toilet tank never gets properly cleaned & it typically has mold, mildew & build up in it. So I can see why people think it\u2019s gross. That being said it\u2019s a bit much to wash your hands to get in the shower, her claim that you touched the shower handle is dumb.", "YTA - you know your girlfriend is a germophone - since it's not likely she'll change, either you embrace/support it, or you resign yourself to fighting because you're being stubborn.\n\nGetting into a fight over something that is entirely preventable is a waste of time.", "YTA , why not just spend the 30 seconds to wash your hands.", "YTA.
