Jaxon and Jenny planned and had their kids fairly young when neither of them had jobs or any savings. Everyone told Jenny she needed to rethink even being with Jaxon because it was generally known he was getting involved with drugs. Dealing was the only \u201cjob\u201d he could have since he never graduated high school and Jenny always defended it with this exact reasoning.\n\nWell, she moved into his apartment, they had kids, she became a SAHM, and everything seemed fine for a while. But 4 years ago, Jaxon was caught on counts for possession of unregistered firearms and heavy drug dealing. I sympathize with my sister because I can\u2019t image how difficult it must be to raise two kids by yourself and having to explain why their dad is in jail, but at the end of the day, this was a risk she knew she was taking by being with him.\n\nNow, the money he left aside for her and the kids has run out and she has come to me. For context, she continued to be a SAHM for the past 4 years even after her boyfriend got locked up and has been putting off getting a job since. Now that she has no money, she STILL wants to be a SAHM and have me foot the bill for her lifestyle and let her and my nieces move into my house. I\u2019m unmarried and child free so I could afford to let them move in and pay for everything for a little while, but my sister even to this day refuses to get a job which is what irks me. She essentially wants to play SAHM role in my house while I take care of her and her kids financially.\n\nObviously, I said there was no chance I would ever allow this, and she needs to face the consequences and finally get a job after all these years. She\u2019s saying how she can\u2019t get anything more than a minimum wage job because she has never worked before and doesn\u2019t have a degree and also that she must continue to be a SAHM so that \u201cthe girls have normalcy during this hard time without their dad\u201d. I call bs and told her she can\u2019t be a SAHM with no other source of household income and that she actually can work because my nieces are at school 8am-4:30pm so she could have a full time job without disturbing their current schedule.\n\nI feel guilty because I love my nieces and I know they\u2019re all now living beneath the poverty line because of their parents decisions and it\u2019s not something they deserve. But at the same time, I know if I gave my sister money or let her move in she would never leave and make my house is a wreck and would keep coming back asking for more. Also, as much as I care for my nieces, I am not mentally or physically ready to have kids in my home, there is a reason I chose to remain child free all these years.\n\nJenny is also fully capable of getting a job, and it\u2019s her own fault she didn\u2019t get one 4 years ago when Jaxon got arrested. I know I\u2019m not obligated to help and it\u2019s her own fault, but I can\u2019t help feeling guilty because they all are my blood family and I know they have no where else to turn to.

Obviously sis could get a job). That being said, you're not required to give anything to them just because they're family, especially when Sis is refusing to step up herself. It'd be one thing if she just needed a little help while she was getting settled into a new routine, but she had 4 years for that. If you still wanted to help your nieces, you could buy/pay for things specifically for them when they need them (things like clothes, books, field trips, etc). That way your nieces aren't totally screwed by your sister's unwillingness to step up", "NTA - You are not responsible for supporting your sister financially.  \n\nShe can work while her children are at school. If she is *unable* to work, there are avenues for that as well.", "NTA - Jenny is a big girl. When you have kids, you are required to provide for them. You are right. Parents need to be responsible to provide an income for their household. Even if your sister were to get government assistance they would require her to work since her children are in school. She can find work with the school district as a clerk, desk job, janitor, etc. Therefore, her work calendar would be the same as her children's. Jenny needs to step up. She should not expect you to change your life to make her life easier.", "NTA. You have no obligation to let them move in - that's A LOT to ask from you. If you want to help her, maybe you can help her get some public assistance, and if your neices need anything in particular, you could pay for that directly.  Like, going with them to buy them some new school clothes or school supplies and paying for that.", "NTA.\n\nHer life and decisions are her business, but not when it affects you. \n\nYou're not responsible for footing the bill for her and her kids to live off your generosity while her deadbeat criminal husband is locked up.", "NTA. She needs to get a job and start on a career. She\u2019s not going to be able to depend on her husband. She needs to begin working NOW so she can be earning a pension. Her days of being a SAHM are over.", "Def NTA. If you really feel guilty and want to do something just for the sake of your nieces you could help her find a job and maybe support her for that while. This will ofc ve from the good of yourself and she doesnt deserve it. And yes she is being lazy and trying to pull excuses", "NTA.. maybe she feels insecure and prefers to say that being a SAHM is what her kids need cause she\u2019s afraid of the rejections that will most definitely come when she starts looking for a job. Help her within your limits", "personally i wouldnt take that kind of disrespect", "NTA obviously, Jenny needs to find herself a job.", "NTA\n\n>that she actually can work because my nieces are at school 8am-4:30pm so she could have a full time job without disturbing their current schedule.\n\nThat's not really accurate though. When you account for travel time, she'd have to both get lucky with timing and have a very stable schedule to make a full time job work without paying for childcare.
