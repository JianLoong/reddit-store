But\u2026 the flip side of that is when someone is paying for you, you are supposed to order at or preferably slightly below what they order as their order sets the price point. So whether we go by \u201cadults pay for their own selves\u201d etiquette or \u201cthe host pays\u201d sis and her partner suck. \n\nAnd facebooking about it is also tacky so idk why family isn\u2019t scolding them for that. Mine are they type where if they did insert themselves (unlikely \u2014 they\u2019re more the type to ignore) they\u2019d tell me I was being immature to post like that and if mom posted the receipt they\u2019d say \u201cwell, seems like you got what you asked for, now didn\u2019t you?!\u201d", "Sometimes when my kids were little (2 of them) and my husband and I went out with my parents we would split it down the middle when they offered. Sometimes because they wanted to go out to eat while we were already out and knew our finances were tight they would pay for the kids. But that was at places like Denny's or Applebee's. Also, we would avoid ordering extras like alcohol, or appetizers and dessert. So if it wasn't offered we could still pay for the kids.", "Not always - In a world where everyone's meals were *about* the same cost, groups will often just split it equally.  Oh no! Your meal cost $5 more than mine and we paid the same!  My word! You had one more beer than I did and we paid the same!  \n\n\nThat's not this situation, because of the disparity.  And in your world, you don't drink and your friends presumably do, so it would be silly for you to have to split things equally, and I hope your friends don't even suggest that!  \n\n\nBut often people do just split the check.", "Exactly. And it's not like it's difficult for the restaurant staff, in this age of computers and what not. Literally adds maybe 30 seconds to settling the check, and probably results in a higher combined tip because every payer probably tips a little differently.", "Sometimes, especially with large groups, it's easier to just take the total, and divide by the number of people, rather than try and figure out who had what after-the-fact.  (Especially if appetizers are involved)\n\nThat doesn't sound like what was happening here though.  Sounds like Sister's in-laws were expecting the whole thing to be split between the two siblings from the start, which is why they ordered so much.  It also sounds like the in-laws weren't invited at first but tagged along anyway?  Like, at that point, I'd be expecting to pay completely for my own meal... but idk, sometimes people are weird.  In these cases, it's good to set expectations ahead of time, so nobody gets their feelings hurt, but OP is still NTA.\n\nI'm a little non-confrontational.  So whenever I'm eating out with people, and I'm not sure how we're splitting the bill, instead of asking, I just pay attention to what everyone else is having, and try to stick to that as my budget for the evening.  Like... if everyone is ordering a $10 cheeseburger, I'm not going to go out of my way to order a $50 Steak, because I think we might be doing an even split... Not only would that be rude because of the money thing, but it'd also be rude 'cause now I'm chowing down on a juicy steak in front of a bunch of people who maybe couldn't afford the steak.", "If I go for lunch or dinner with someone, if I\u2019m even thinking of suggesting to just split I\u2019ll be on the down side. And not till bill time. I don\u2019t mind covering a couple extra bucks just to make life easy. But if I was the one ordering drinks or adding extras to the meal I\u2019d never expect to go 50/50. \n\nAlso\u2026anyone else prefer to find out their friend or what have you is covering your dinner as bill time comes? I don\u2019t feel like I have to be paranoid in what I order and the price, not wanting to get the pricey meals and look greedy lol.", "YOWZA they are total ah.  Even if you'd agreed to do an even split it should have been split 1/3 to you and 2/3 to them.  They're just mad they tried to grift a meal and failed.", "On the fence about her. On one hand, she defended the person who was wrongly being targeted. On the other hand, she was stirring the pot.", "NTA \n\nIf they basically tagged along to something you has organised with your mom and then ordered a ridiculous amount of food they they should be expecting to pay for their own meals.", "Absolutely not.

There is no way that you could even be considered TA here.", "NTA\n\nYour sis started by venting on social media. You responded with facts instead of playing victim.

Of course NTA, and you would have been n t a even if you posted those receipts.", "Thanks.  I didn\u2019t see that.", "NTA, they tried to take advantage and then lied about it on social media. You showed the proof and now they're upset about how they look.", "This is it right here", "I think that's pretty obvious, why else would they throw a fit.\n\nThink about it. You see someone order $25 food. Your mother orders $60. In what world would you order over $150 each?! And the actually propose to split it all?", "This is my brother 100%. I\u2019ve invited him to join us for my mothers birthday meal that I fully intended to pay for, and without fail, he orders like a NY strip and runs up a sizable bar tab. It\u2019s rude and annoying, but I don\u2019t really deal with it more than every couple years. I also make less than him. When our older brother invites us join him for a restaurant party, he makes sure it\u2019s all separate checks and that fool will order mozerella sticks. I should note-my older brother actually pays my bill, even when it\u2019s separate checks. He does it specifically to secretly stick it to our younger brother, knowing how he rolls. Part of why I pay it, is I KNOW my mother sees what he does and would consider that being tacky and classless, so with him being the \u2018golden child\u2019 it makes me feel pleasantly sanctimonious.", "$300 meal, OP said each of them had a total of over $150", "Between the two of them, over $300 meal.

She just refuses to get Venmo or anything else. At this point, I think it's just stubbornness...", "I was literally so confused reading their comment. Nickel and diming your kids is crazyyy.", "Which makes it even worse. You shouldn't split the bill down the middle if costs are wildly different anyway, but you wouldn't demand someone buys you an extra five drinks in a pub setting; just because you've got a tab in a restaurant doesn't mean you can justify doing so there.", "What?  I paid less than that at the restaurant in Seattle for some noodles with protein. Unless you are counting tip, tax and then some, it shouldn't be more than $15-20 at even the nice food trucks.  I would go to restaurants that were $150/person but the average dinner out was considerably less. \n\nSeattle is not cheap but I recognize there are more expensive places out there but I couldn't imagine paying $32 for some noodles. That shit better be Gordon Ramsey. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Alcohol will make a big disparity very quickly. As will proteins such as Wagyu beef or expensive sushi. Also remember OP barely ate, so you should really be comparing the $65 to the $150, and doubleish is always manageable by someone entitled and expecting someone else to pay for it.", "Your older brother is the man!", "Some people are just greedy and entitled.  That\u2019s the thing and it\u2019s a big reality including in families.", "Just caught that. I thought it was $150 total for sibling and partner", "It was at a festival and was an excellent food truck (actually one of the cheaper options among about 50 selections). Base price $26.00.
