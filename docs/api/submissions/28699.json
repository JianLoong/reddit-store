Your mother's fine though.", "Everything I read just makes me shake my head but I seriously can't get past the familymembers saying 'we have a right to be angry'\n\nIn no galaxy are you TA", "NTA. This is ridiculous. Next time state it in advance. Watch their diet change.", "NTA. Perfect. The only thing you maybe should have done was tell them you were paying your own, &50% of mom's. Maybe they would have been so greedy.", "It's hard to put them on an info diet when other people are the ones airing the dirty laundry. All you can do is duck and cover until the flying monkeys are gone. It's so wierd to me how people just interject themselves into someone else's conflict. If someone asks me I try to change the subject and avoid it altogether. I don't need other people's drama.", "This. This was my family earlier this month, for my eldest's birthday. Her sisters both work, so they have their own money. She'd asked for a brunch downtown at a restaurant we all love, and we met her and her gf there, so there were five of us total.\n\nWe actually forgot to mention we were paying separately, which...was our mistake... So when the check came, we all started pulling out calculators, because while my younger daughters were paying for their own food and drinks, and the girlfriend was paying for her own, as was I...we were all splitting the cost of the birthday girls' food and drinks.\n\nAnd we had to figure it out at the table, with my middle pulling her credit card out first and telling the rest of us to pay her back. (Which meant that my youngest and myself had to remember how much we owed her...since she refuses to use Venmo, CashApp, or PayPal, no matter how much we all beg! So she wanted it all back in cash!)\n\nBut *none* of us expected it to be split evenly, **besides the birthday girl's foods.**\n\nOP is completely NTA, but their sister and her partner are 1000% TAH.", "I'm grateful for that! She immediately called me and said to send the screneshots cause she wanted to settle it before she went off lol", "Yeah I'm really baffled about how OP's family can simultaneously blame them for airing the truth (when it was mom who did that) *and* say that sis & partner were being selfish....\nOverall, family seem pretty quick to escalate drama!", "And the other party had literally had *jaw surgery*! I can't even.", "That's what I was thinking!", "Right? How much food do you get for $150? They probably wanted leftovers so they could continue pigging out at home. I've had steak and lobster meals at nice restaurants for much less.", "In what world does a bill get split 50/50? I don't drink. I wouldn't ever pay for someone's alcohol drinks. Checks are always split per person/party. OP's family is crazy.", "She was a champ for that. I didn't even know what was going on when I got the texts from extended family. It was just a lot of general name calling. Then she called me and told me and wanted the receipts and WENT OFF. It was fantastic lol", "Except mum.", "I'm definitely wondering how much of an AH I was to send my mother the receipts and encourage her when she made the post proving the amounts. Esp cause I keep being told I'm an AH for 'exposing' my sister and her partner. So I'm wondering if I let it go too far.", "They were well aware of my limited food choices as we had gone out to dinner a week after my surgery and discussed my recovery. They have been aware that my food choices will be limited for a few months. \n\nAlso, every time we go out, the bill is split by person, aside from the fact that I normally pay our mother's bill aside from special occasions for mom, those times we have always split mom's bill, so it wasn't a new thing. But this time it's being blown up because this is the most expensive place we've been to for a long time and they ordered more than they usually do.", "50/50", "Mom chose it. Initially, I was going to bring her solo. When my sister found out we were going, she and her partner said they wanted to come along and treat mom to a nice meal as well. So we set a date and went. \n\nA reasonably priced nice meal wouldn't derail anyone's budget if accounted for. However, from what I hear and see, they are both pretty reckless with income (excess spending, taking out loans and debt to cover the bills they can't pay due to the extra spending, etc) \n\nIt doesn't help that they ordered significantly more than they usually would. They ordered the equivalent of 2-3 meals each.", "[removed]", "True. I've just gone by the thinking that if you don't speak with someone problematic, you can't give them anything to misinterpret or twist into what they want.  But you're right,  it's very tricky, and I might not have used the right term.", "[deleted]", "Nta and DON'T  agree  to anything  split  in the future.  Also remember  there were 2!!of them  to 1 of you  so they ate double  and wanted to pay half of the whole  bill.  Huge ah kudos  ti your  mom", "\"We're allowed to misrepresent the situation on social media to instigate family members to chew you out, but you're not allowed to defend yourself in any way from our baseless claims.\"", "There has to be drinks involved", "She's probably just as done with your sister's shanaynays as you are. I'm so glad you have her!!", "You are definitely not the AH!! They were hoping to get a  significantly reduced meal and were mad that you didn\u2019t pay for it. They had No problem calling you out on FB but when the tables were turned they had an issue with it. I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time they have done something like this", "My apologies.  Your sister and SO are though.  You are in the right completely.", "Right? If I'm not there, what do I care what the meal cost and who paid the tab?!\n\nBut if I saw that, I *would* be wondering why my cousin/nephew/aunt expected her sibling to pay for her and her partner's expensive meals, especially when they clearly ordered barely anything for themselves.\n\n(If anything...if OP's was only $25, the sister should have picked up *theirs,* rather than expecting the reverse to be true!)", "I think the thing that applies here may be FAFO, f**k around and find out. Sibling and partner knew the agreement, tried to get a cheap meal, and found out OP wasn't stupid.", "I was joking, for the most part. We all *did* round up, especially since we were factoring in the tip (since most of us never actually have cash on hand so...)\n\nAlso, I don't know what generation you mean \"is so fucking lost,\" since my children and I are, per force, two very different generations. And my pointing out that all of my kids are old enough to work, and in one case clearly isn't living at home, should tell you plenty about which ones we belong to. \n\nI'd venture to say you're not even old enough to be in *my* generation, so...", "This generation sounds like they're old enough to have grandkids...", "[deleted]", "Not a Boomer? Millennial, my dude. lmao\n\nBut if you're Gen X, you're old enough to have learned how to actually not be a jackass on the interwebs, one would think.\n\nDid *your* mommy not take *you* out for enough birthday brunches?", "Wow. Gen x is not normally this rude. Please don\u2019t represent for us anymore", "[deleted]", "Might I suggest getting an actual hobby? One that doesn't involve social interaction, since you still haven't mastered it in over four decades on Earth so far..."]}
