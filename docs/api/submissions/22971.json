In her culture women manage the household/family, and since none of them speak English, she\u2019s been \u201cmanaging\u201d everything for the 4 of them ever since. This includes small but annoying things like her spending 3 hrs on hold with BIL\u2019s Internet provider last weekend because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d even though he understands my English just fine, extending all the way up to her completely setting up/running multiple businesses for her brother for free while working 2 jobs and school since he wasn\u2019t in the country. After graduating she began looking for a career but her family sat her down, the businesses made her brother a multi-millionaire so they told her she was now the COO (without benefits), and determined 60k should cover her expenses despite living in a top 3 cost of living city, which is what she\u2019s been at for the past 8 years. I encouraged her to stand up for herself and stop since she won\u2019t let me say anything but instead of increasing her pay he offered to let her do \u201cside jobs\u201d to make more. She now meal preps lunches and dinners for him, became a notary, is getting her real estate license, builds and manages their websites, manages their social media, etc all of which she has to do in her (our) \u201coff time\u201d for $100 a week minus what we spend on ingredients for his meals.\n\nI ask her to stop, I work full time we are fine, she refuses. I accepted that all I can do is try. The issue issue is, each time a side job is added she becomes stressed and short at home unless I get out of work and have the house clean and dinner ready. Even then she might get upset because I left my clothes on the floor when changing after work or something.  Normally I just put up with it and take on more but I finally reached a breaking point and told her no, i was tired of coming second to her brother, and we needed to figure something out. She asked if I really thought she put her family above me and when I said yes she broke down crying asking what more she could do, that she was doing so much and she needed my help. I told her to stop taking side projects, she refused, as a compromise I told her she needs to take over all of the mental load at home during one of her projects. if she suddenly wants to change the agreed upon setup, I need her to outline via text exactly what she want me to do each day because I don\u2019t know if today she wants to do our normal setup or if I\u2019ll get snapped at if the floors Aren\u2019t swept by the time she gets home and I\u2019m tired of it. \n\nI told some friends and they are split. I\u2019m adding more to my wife\u2019s already overcrowded plate but I work full time as well and can\u2019t keep doing this but don\u2019t see another way to put my foot down.", "created_utc": 1690137849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157mn77/aita_for_making_my_wife_take_on_100_of_the_mental/", "score": 285, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anything else would be not loving their family, that gives everything for them. How could they be so ungrateful as that?!?!?!\n\nThink about it.

What do you think happens to that person as an adult. \n\nEnter in, your wife. \n\nObviously she doesn't want to do therapy. Her parents don't want her to figure what's going on.

She needs to get away from her family that has certain cultura expectation of women and she cannot break the cycle. \n\nShe is also afraid of not living up to their expectations or to say no. \n\nIn return, she is hurting you and this marriage but she cannot stop it. \n\nWill you guys be able to move away? Can you talk to the BIL to lay out the terms and how he\u2019s abusing his sister? Can you bring her into couple therapy? \n\nIf all else fail, you either live with it or seek a divorce lawyer.", "NTA", "Your wife loves her family more than she loves you. NTA but it's probably not going to get better. She knows she is being abused but can't express her emotions to her family. You get the short temper. \n\nAsk her what would happen if she was snippy to her brother? Or parents? It just would never happen. They would never tolerate it. You are unfortunately always going to be second to that, and if she tries to change the dynamic, there will be negative repercussions from the people she made rich. They don't want to share the wealth, and she's going to be their servant forever. \n\nBe careful, any pushback from her and they'll turn on you because they know you'll have put the idea (of personal freedom, of fair compensation, of loyalty to someone else, an outsider)in her head.", "NTA\n\nSeeing as she's managed to create and run her family's business and they are all rich and treating her appallinging... why doesn't she just do the same for herself.\n\nHer other option is doing a really bad job and running down the business, choosing the worst school and other stuff along these lines.... perhaps doing a bad job means that she won't be asked to do that job any more.\n\nBut it's a hard one.. she's been indoctrinated.  See if she'd agree to see a therapist?", "My gf took on a second job because her full time doesn\u2019t give her extra to help around the house like she wants to. Mind you this is something that isn\u2019t required one but by me but I get guilt tripped  by her when she has to work said second job. This was a decision solely made by her as I make enough to cover everything without any help nor have I ever asked. It\u2019s like in her mind she thinks she needs to when she really doesn\u2019t", "This is what I would do. Do all this research and inform her you will be speaking with them.\nAnd to be clear, you don't have to go in demanding or expecting a COO salary plus SM manager salary plus personal chef salary because they're family, but it has to be something vaguely market rate reasonable for her literal time and skills, because $60k is absolutely beyond comically insulting. Help her negotiate.", "Usually in these cultures when the woman marries, she is suppose to take care of her own household. The boys and their wives are suppose to take care of mom and dad. \n\nWhen all avenues fail and your almost done, i would pull a hail mary and tell the family that she cannot be doing more jobs than what she already is doing.", "Thieves sounds about right. A multi million company she spearheaded to only be paid 60k and I\u2019m sure no ownership. Her \u201cloved ones\u201d are robbing her of her well deserved money and sanity\n\nNTA", "How can you describe his behaviors like this & then say he's a great guy? He seems, at a minimum, manipulative, selfish, & exploitative", "I think what OP is suggesting is that his problematic actions come from culture and familiar norms, not malice or selfishness. He\u2019s as immersed in this culture as OP\u2019s wife is; he has more obligation to question it because he\u2019s the one benefitting so immensely, but that is still a meaningful distinction.", "He didn't say no", "We get it. You hate men. Move on."]}
