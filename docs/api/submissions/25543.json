Not to put shade on your accomplishments, but think about it.\n\nI've known many Doctors (both medical and philosophical) that are great in their chosen field and pretty useless in other areas of life.

First of all- Well Done! As for your exams post covid- go you! And OMG a fourth ALevel. That hardly ever happened in my school.
