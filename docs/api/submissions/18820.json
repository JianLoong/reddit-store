She's here every single day, sometimes as early as 10am and doesn't leave until 5-8pm. I truly have no idea how this woman has the ability to talk as much as she does and it's one of those \"I'm going to stand really close to you and stare at you awkwardly the whole time I'm talking\" types of things. \n\nSo basically I could literally be on the phone in the middle of a conversation, reading a book or even sitting there with music audibly blaring through my headphones and she will still try talking to me and it's about nothing of importance, ever. Yesterday was definitely the tipping point for me. I'm sitting here trying to clean. I have my headphones in and my music was quite literally blaring through them. I couldn't hear anything. I happen to look up and see that she was talking to me because her mouth was moving. I take my headphones out and she's already half way through a conversation involving the dog hair I'm sweeping up, talking about how she could make a rug out of it. So I said \"ok\" and kept sweeping. She then starts in about how she used to make Persian rugs for a living and that turned in to how she used to interior design mansions and whatever. I wasn't even looking at her anymore. I literally kept cleaning and she was following me around talking. This continued literally for hours. The conversation changed 10s of times and she was the only one talking. \n\nWhen she left I went to my roommates and told them that if they insist on having this girl over here than they need to have a conversation with her about leaving me alone. I'm really fed up with being disrupted when I'm trying to do my own thing and being bombarded with millions of conversations that I want no part in. Especially considering it doesn't matter how many times I say \"I'm trying to be alone right now\" or \"I was listening to music and trying to disassociate\" makes her stop. That just gives her conversation starters. I was legitimately called transphobic for asking my roommates to keep this girl away from me. \"She has it hard enough without people being rude to her\" or \"It's literally so obvious she makes you uncomfortable for being mTf trans\" or \"you're grossed out by her simply because she likes you and is trans\".

It's not your job to entertain their friend.\n\nWhy are they not spending time with her while she's at your house?", "NTA and if she's your roommates' friend they are the ones responsible for entertaining her when she visits. I feel like them bringing up that she's trans is a cop out and they're not very motivated to interact with her either. Tell them her not respecting your boundaries in your own home is making it a hostile living environment for you, which isn't even remotely appropriate for a paying tenant. Their options are to either entertain her themselves when she's over, have a discussion that she needs to leave you alone if you're wearing headphones or busy doing your own thing, or no longer allow her to visit. \n\nAnd it's not transphobic to not be attracted to someone. It sounds like she's not even remotely compatible with you regardless of if she's trans or not. You don't owe anytime attraction just because they like you ffs.", "You don't have a bedroom? Shut the door in her face.", "NTA.  You've tried telling her that you need space/time to yourself and don't want to talk,  and she isn't respecting that boundary.  Asking your roommates to talk to her about it is the logical next step.  Unless there's some sort of details you're leaving out, I'm confused how your roommates think her being trans is relevant to what you're asking them to do.  Your friends sound like the sort of \"allies\" who are afraid that any criticism of or boundary-setting with a person who happens to be trans will get them labeled as transphobic.", "I talk. A lot. And so I know that the world is filled with people who don't want ANYONE yammering at them non stop all the time. (My older sister loves me dearly.

So, I have to take the cues to leave her the heck alone sometimes.\ud83d\udc4c)\n\nNTA. There is nothing wrong with you if you have the need for your personal space, privacy and silence. Even people who yammer can be overwhelmed and want peace and quiet.  \n\n\"I'm going over hear to listen to my own thoughts. Don't follow me. I'm not up for it today.

This person is completely disrespecting them but it doesn\u2019t seem malicious. Your housemates are major AHs though.", "I have known people like this. It's a psychological compulsion of some kind, almost like Tourettes. They just can't stop gibbering. Having said this this type of behavior is intolerable.

They are inviting her because she likes you and they do not want tonrespect.your boundaries. \n\nGreat, time for you or them to find a new place to live.", "NTA. You're entitled to peaceful enjoyment of your home and she's disrupting that. You should also have a conversation with your roommates about limits on visitors. Having a guest a third of the time is excessive.", "NTA. And why is this woman there for hours a day when she doesn\u2019t pay rent? That isn\u2019t reasonable. \n\nYou deserve to have peace within your own home and not to have someone in your face talking to you constantly. \n\nI think I\u2019d establish a ground rule that she can\u2019t be there unless your housemates are also there to entertain her.", "NTA. What do they mean by \"likes you\"? If this is some kind of flirting thing and they know about it they are even larger assholes than you imply. Why haven't they conveyed your frustrations to her?", "NTA. I bet your roommates are trying to set her up with you. Every time you tell her to give you some space, your roommates are probably behind the scenes saying \"That's just their way. You just have to be persistent.\"\n\nI might be projecting, because I've literally had this happen. But try bringing it up with your roommates and see how they react.", "NTA, not liking a trans person is NOT transphobia. You two seem to just not click and on top of that she is not respecting your boundaries which she should, your complaint is valid there. There is only one thing to consider on your side, unconscious biases. People often have biases they are not aware of and this is a great opportunity to reflect on that. Do you think you'd have the same reaction if she is not trans? Did you maybe reject her harsher or easier because she is trans?

It\u2019s your boundaries and personal space, they need to understand that.", "NTA, you have the right to not feel stalked or followed in your home.
