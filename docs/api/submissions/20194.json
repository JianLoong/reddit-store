This happened in May but we are still dealing with the fallout. Our son is very clearly upset with us still because of his punishment. This is why I am posting here asking for my husband and I.\n\nOur son has 3 best friends who he has been close with since elementary school. They have all played sports together and between that and school, we have become friends with the other boys' parents. \n\nI was not there to see this happen, so this is the account of another mom. The boys were at the one friend's house who has a pool and had some girls over. They were sitting at a table that could be seen from the kitchen window. The boy's mom saw her son taking pictures on snapchat of a girl who was there. After everyone left she confronted her son about this and found a snapchat group that the 4 boys made where the share \"snipes\" of girls that they've taken.\n\nI am not going to go into detail on how upset this made my husband and I. We did think we raised our son to be much better than that. All the parents got involved and we each punished our sons. The chat was deleted and their phones were searched for images. Because of the severity, we collectively decided that our boys would not be allowed to go to their senior prom which was 3 weeks away at this point.\n\nSo here is what I am questioning. A week before prom, all 3 of the other sets of parents caved and decided they were going to allow their boys to go. I spoke with a few of them and questioned their reasoning. I was taken aback by some of their dismissals. I am not going to quote word for word but the general theme was holding their sons out of a once in a lifetime event and \\*rather disgustingly\\* almost chalking it up to \"boys will be boys\". They said they will find a new punishment. \n\nMy husband and I decided that we were having none of that. We did hold our son back from prom. We did not allow him to attend the after party either. He was livid and still is. He keeps saying how we took this experience from him and it was not fair.

Missing the prom was least of the consequences he could have suffered.", "NTA - good for you for standing by your punishment and NOT caving.  this is a valuable lesson for him, and conversely, a terrible lesson from his friend's parents.  accountability is such an important thing and now he very clearly understands his actions have consequences.  shame on those other parents for folding like a blanket.", "What they did was disgusting.  I think that there could have been other significant punishments you could have chosen that would still have been appropriate.  It's hard for me to call you the AH for sticking to your guns on a punishment for such a crude act.

In the end I think you will regret this decision even though you are NTA.", "100% NTA. \n\nThe other parents though? They definitely suck. I get that prom is a big thing, but your son could've gone if he didn't get himself into trouble. Screw them for caving and permissing their childrens' gross behavior.", "NTA.

Or is he upset he\u2019s the only one who missed prom? I don\u2019t think it matters if the punishment fit or not at this point. Like you said, it was a one time only event that can\u2019t be redone. You can\u2019t take away the punishment or change it. You aren\u2019t wrong for standing by his punishment. You felt he did something that was equal to missing out on a lifetime event. You don\u2019t say what these are photos of, but if they were girls who were naked, in dangerous or compromising positions or situations that\u2019s not right. You don\u2019t say if the chat is only between the four boys, or if it\u2019s an internet wide with unknown numbers of boys in the school, then that\u2019s also not right. Depending on the situation, those are actions with consequences that can\u2019t be undone. Once on the internet and shared around, the photos are forever. Those girls may have been affected for a lifetime like his punish was something that\u2019s once in a lifetime. Every action has consequences. He took and shared the photo and his consequence is he missed prom. You punished him by banning him from prom, a potential consequence is your son being upset.", "NTA i am surprised the school is allowing them to go. How will the girls feel seeing those boys who violated their privacy at prom? Doesn't the school have rules about this.", "NTA what your son and his friends did was gross. I'm glad you nipped it in the bud and those pictures were deleted. \n\nIt just sucks that the other boys got to go to their prom and he didn't. For sure,  he's probably gonna be upset about that for a long time.As that's a once in a life time event. It almost seems like he was the only one punished for it and that why maybe, he's still angry.\n\nMaybe he'll learn from this and won't do it again.

Hopefully, he gets over it.", "Info, what is a \u201csnipe\u201d?", "NTA although I think there needs to be more than grounding like attending classes for this type of issue.I will say though your son may resent you for the rest of your life for making him miss his prom.", "NTA - I found out boys did this to me in high school and middle school and that I had sexual nicknames about my body.

Let's see how well they turn out or, better yet, see how bad the parents freak out when their kid gets into trouble and they can't help them, because Mommy and Daddy let them get away with the shit they pulled. If they're doing something so disrespectful and disgusting in h.s. I can only imagine what they're gonna do after they graduate. The thing is, they WILL get caught, and once they're 18, there is NOTHING the parents can do, they'll be charged as adults.

Actions like that deserve consequences with follow through.", "NTA.He will remember and maybe even learn.", "NTA, but expect years-long repercussions.", "INFO\n\nThere's just not enough here to form a judgement. What exactly is a \"snipe?\" What relation did the girl have to either of these guys? What exactly did the other parents say to justify letting their sons go to prom? You said you didn't want to say it \"word for word\" but then you said the ALMOST said \"boys will be boys.\" And given that prom is *usually* a one-time event, is it really unreasonable to find a new punishment like the other parents? \n\nI don't know, too many key details are left out.", "This is seriously lacking info. What is a snipe? Were the girls aware of the nature of the photos? What exactly WAS the nature of the photos?", "NTA. But you fucked up and you know it by writing this post. You are really asking how we get our son back from what you did. I don't know the answer to that but I know his current behavior will continue to occur for awhile, so buckle up buttercup.", "INFO:\n\nyou aren't giving much information on what the photos are exactly of. How inappropriate were they? I think that would help in judgement of the punishment", "There was a few weeks ago a post about a guy who kept his son from prom because his son didn't clean up after himself and his friends, and the guy got reamed out. I was braced for this to be a repeat of that, but this is definitely a different circumstance and I agree NTA. It's an extreme punishment for sure, but the actions are similarly extreme. Frankly if I were you I'd be very worried about letting him go off to college and be in that kind of environment, he's a predator in the making.", "INFO\n\nWhy were the photos objectionable?", "[deleted]", "YTA. There are so many ways to punish a teen for wrong behaviour that don\u2019t include taking away a once in a lifetime experience that many view as a rite of passage.

It is what you deserve.", "Soft YTA - I only say this because you didn\u2019t think out your punishment. Did you ask him if girls had done anything like this to him or rejected him in a way that caused him to act this way? Girls can be equally as cruel, but are not often punished if the treatment is toward boys. Often this behavior stems from being treated badly by the opposite sex. Was that conversation had, or did you jump to conclusions? You stole from him an experience, you can never give back, similar to missing a wedding or a funeral. Along with taking his phone and other consequences. This will probably detrimentally effect your relationship permanently. \n\nYour consequences allude to expecting perfection out of an 18 year old boy, maybe you should set equally high parenting standards for yourself.", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t have done a group punishment in the first place.

I was prepared to have a totally different vote because the prom is so important. But you\u2019ve done the right thing.

Hey consent or lack there of, and whether any of the parents bothered to ask first before punishing, affects judgement.", "NTA\nI work at a school and I am sick of teenagers not being held accountable for their actions.

Yeah, you screwed up and he will never forget it.\nSure some punishment would be ok but did anyone think to calmly talk to him? A professional perhaps for a couple sessions. Pure punishment like what he got will make him hate. Not cool", "Was all ready to come in thinking it would be an over reach of punishment. Happens offer here. But damn, no. \nNTA. Good on you for sticking to your guns.

That would have made a bigger impact and a lasting one", "NTA", "Don't be surprised when he goes no contact.

And since you all agreed on the same punishments, the other parents are douches for relenting.", "Before anything else, obvious NTA. But while accountability is super important, in this case OP\u2019s son also needs to grow up and his brain develop more. Hopefully then he will realize what he did was wrong, but at the time he likely sees his parents as the villains, and himself as the scapegoat. For him, I doubt it\u2019s about what he did wrong. To him, his parents are the ones doing the wrong. Had his friends\u2019 parents held their ground, it may have made the intended point. But I think they lost it due to the other parents (frankly) sucking and being incredibly stupid pushovers who excuse sexual harassment. It\u2019s unfortunate. OP\u2019s son probably learned nothing. Hopefully in the future he\u2019ll understand, though. Nothing more OP can do other than to force him into therapy, maybe. At least they tried, sucks the other parents let it go.", "Yeah I feel like this kid and his friends might just grow up to be the guys who share revenge porn (posting a girls nudes after she breaks up with them, aka: a sex crime) if they aren\u2019t properly dealt with now.

I don\u2019t agree with forcing him to apologize to the young ladies, as that could cause them stress or additional humiliation but also burdens them with having to forgive when they are already the victims in this situation.

Restorative justice practices can be very successful in changing behavior, especially for juveniles. For example, writing apology letters to the girls and recognizing his wrongs. This requires the consent of the victims (maybe first contact the parents?) and also the consideration that it can in some cases be burdensome for them to be reminded of what happened. While it also can help a victim\u2019s healing, it\u2019d be wrong to say it never causes additional harms to the victim either. If they don\u2019t know about it, then don\u2019t just go and send the letters. Don\u2019t keep them in the dark just for your sons protection, though. What he writes, if sent, can be used against him. But truthfully, it has every reason to be. Though, the current justice system won\u2019t do any good. For anyone on either side, likely. Anyway, writing the letters (even unsent) could help, or sending them to surrogate victims through organization you can probably find online.\n\nI can\u2019t explain everything in one post, so my apologies for missing very important elements of the restorative approach.

Not just standard photos of them sitting, swimming, or standing around. Think upskirts. \n\nSo take my advice with a grain of salt depending on the severity of what they did.

Or had the principal been told?", "You really shouldn\u2019t make such bold comments about the legality of such acts if you have done no research or not aware of basic laws & rights. \n\nWhether picture-taking violates the photo subject's privacy rights depends on that person's reasonable expectation of privacy (REP) where the photo was taken. The more public a place is, the less REP a person has. For example, your REP at a park or on the street is very limited.\n\nBut, you can reasonably expect privacy inside your home or another private place, such as a changing room. Sometimes, you have a REP inside a public place, such as in a bathroom at a park or a locker room at a gym.\n\nConsider the example above with the neighbor. Your REP might change depending on whether you were in your front or back yard when your neighbor snapped the photo. For instance, if there is a fence around your backyard, you may have a claim that there is a higher REP than in the front yard. Someone at the pool with them could legally take a picture of them creep shot or not. If the neighbor were to do such a thing it\u2019s quite possible for it to be illegal.", "Cool, what state has laws that violate the 1st amendment?", "Consensually sent nude photos that are illegal because they had been a)nude and b)sent for explicit sexual purposes, hence being pornography.

I suggest asking the boys why they act like this and if a girl offended them and you freak out and assume I\u2019m blaming girls. The boys are responsible for their actions, but maybe it might help to look into why. Also we should look into why these boys have unmonitored Snapchat when everyone knows how it\u2019s used. This is lazy parenting, but it hits home, so everyone gets pissed and starts making assumptions.", "She knows her son is upset, but it\u2019s also *incredibly normal* for teens to have ridiculous and big reactions because they have a lot of hormones and emotions, even at the sons age. Again, if he acts that way in his late 20s/30s/40s that\u2019s really on him. They shouldn\u2019t change their punishment based on whether he\u2019d potentially be petty in the future."]}
