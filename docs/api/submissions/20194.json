This happened in May but we are still dealing with the fallout. Our son is very clearly upset with us still because of his punishment. This is why I am posting here asking for my husband and I.\n\nOur son has 3 best friends who he has been close with since elementary school. They have all played sports together and between that and school, we have become friends with the other boys' parents. \n\nI was not there to see this happen, so this is the account of another mom. The boys were at the one friend's house who has a pool and had some girls over. They were sitting at a table that could be seen from the kitchen window. The boy's mom saw her son taking pictures on snapchat of a girl who was there. After everyone left she confronted her son about this and found a snapchat group that the 4 boys made where the share \"snipes\" of girls that they've taken.\n\nI am not going to go into detail on how upset this made my husband and I. We did think we raised our son to be much better than that. All the parents got involved and we each punished our sons. The chat was deleted and their phones were searched for images. Because of the severity, we collectively decided that our boys would not be allowed to go to their senior prom which was 3 weeks away at this point.\n\nSo here is what I am questioning. A week before prom, all 3 of the other sets of parents caved and decided they were going to allow their boys to go. I spoke with a few of them and questioned their reasoning. I was taken aback by some of their dismissals. I am not going to quote word for word but the general theme was holding their sons out of a once in a lifetime event and \\*rather disgustingly\\* almost chalking it up to \"boys will be boys\". They said they will find a new punishment. \n\nMy husband and I decided that we were having none of that. We did hold our son back from prom. We did not allow him to attend the after party either. He was livid and still is. He keeps saying how we took this experience from him and it was not fair.

Missing the prom was least of the consequences he could have suffered.", "NTA - good for you for standing by your punishment and NOT caving.  this is a valuable lesson for him, and conversely, a terrible lesson from his friend's parents.  accountability is such an important thing and now he very clearly understands his actions have consequences.  shame on those other parents for folding like a blanket.", "What they did was disgusting.  I think that there could have been other significant punishments you could have chosen that would still have been appropriate.  It's hard for me to call you the AH for sticking to your guns on a punishment for such a crude act.

In the end I think you will regret this decision even though you are NTA.", "100% NTA. \n\nThe other parents though? They definitely suck. I get that prom is a big thing, but your son could've gone if he didn't get himself into trouble. Screw them for caving and permissing their childrens' gross behavior.", "NTA.

Or is he upset he\u2019s the only one who missed prom? I don\u2019t think it matters if the punishment fit or not at this point. Like you said, it was a one time only event that can\u2019t be redone. You can\u2019t take away the punishment or change it. You aren\u2019t wrong for standing by his punishment. You felt he did something that was equal to missing out on a lifetime event. You don\u2019t say what these are photos of, but if they were girls who were naked, in dangerous or compromising positions or situations that\u2019s not right. You don\u2019t say if the chat is only between the four boys, or if it\u2019s an internet wide with unknown numbers of boys in the school, then that\u2019s also not right. Depending on the situation, those are actions with consequences that can\u2019t be undone. Once on the internet and shared around, the photos are forever. Those girls may have been affected for a lifetime like his punish was something that\u2019s once in a lifetime. Every action has consequences. He took and shared the photo and his consequence is he missed prom. You punished him by banning him from prom, a potential consequence is your son being upset.", "NTA i am surprised the school is allowing them to go. How will the girls feel seeing those boys who violated their privacy at prom? Doesn't the school have rules about this.", "NTA what your son and his friends did was gross. I'm glad you nipped it in the bud and those pictures were deleted. \n\nIt just sucks that the other boys got to go to their prom and he didn't. For sure,  he's probably gonna be upset about that for a long time.As that's a once in a life time event. It almost seems like he was the only one punished for it and that why maybe, he's still angry.\n\nMaybe he'll learn from this and won't do it again.

Hopefully, he gets over it.", "Info, what is a \u201csnipe\u201d?", "NTA although I think there needs to be more than grounding like attending classes for this type of issue.I will say though your son may resent you for the rest of your life for making him miss his prom.", "NTA - I found out boys did this to me in high school and middle school and that I had sexual nicknames about my body.

Let's see how well they turn out or, better yet, see how bad the parents freak out when their kid gets into trouble and they can't help them, because Mommy and Daddy let them get away with the shit they pulled. If they're doing something so disrespectful and disgusting in h.s. I can only imagine what they're gonna do after they graduate. The thing is, they WILL get caught, and once they're 18, there is NOTHING the parents can do, they'll be charged as adults.

Actions like that deserve consequences with follow through.", "NTA.He will remember and maybe even learn.", "NTA, but expect years-long repercussions.", "INFO\n\nThere's just not enough here to form a judgement. What exactly is a \"snipe?\" What relation did the girl have to either of these guys? What exactly did the other parents say to justify letting their sons go to prom? You said you didn't want to say it \"word for word\" but then you said the ALMOST said \"boys will be boys.\" And given that prom is *usually* a one-time event, is it really unreasonable to find a new punishment like the other parents? \n\nI don't know, too many key details are left out.", "This is seriously lacking info. What is a snipe? Were the girls aware of the nature of the photos? What exactly WAS the nature of the photos?", "NTA. But you fucked up and you know it by writing this post. You are really asking how we get our son back from what you did. I don't know the answer to that but I know his current behavior will continue to occur for awhile, so buckle up buttercup.", "INFO:\n\nyou aren't giving much information on what the photos are exactly of. How inappropriate were they? I think that would help in judgement of the punishment", "There was a few weeks ago a post about a guy who kept his son from prom because his son didn't clean up after himself and his friends, and the guy got reamed out. I was braced for this to be a repeat of that, but this is definitely a different circumstance and I agree NTA. It's an extreme punishment for sure, but the actions are similarly extreme. Frankly if I were you I'd be very worried about letting him go off to college and be in that kind of environment, he's a predator in the making.", "INFO\n\nWhy were the photos objectionable?", "[deleted]", "YTA. There are so many ways to punish a teen for wrong behaviour that don\u2019t include taking away a once in a lifetime experience that many view as a rite of passage.

It is what you deserve.", "Soft YTA - I only say this because you didn\u2019t think out your punishment. Did you ask him if girls had done anything like this to him or rejected him in a way that caused him to act this way? Girls can be equally as cruel, but are not often punished if the treatment is toward boys. Often this behavior stems from being treated badly by the opposite sex. Was that conversation had, or did you jump to conclusions? You stole from him an experience, you can never give back, similar to missing a wedding or a funeral. Along with taking his phone and other consequences. This will probably detrimentally effect your relationship permanently. \n\nYour consequences allude to expecting perfection out of an 18 year old boy, maybe you should set equally high parenting standards for yourself.", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t have done a group punishment in the first place.

I was prepared to have a totally different vote because the prom is so important. But you\u2019ve done the right thing.

Hey consent or lack there of, and whether any of the parents bothered to ask first before punishing, affects judgement.", "NTA\nI work at a school and I am sick of teenagers not being held accountable for their actions.

Yeah, you screwed up and he will never forget it.\nSure some punishment would be ok but did anyone think to calmly talk to him? A professional perhaps for a couple sessions. Pure punishment like what he got will make him hate. Not cool", "Was all ready to come in thinking it would be an over reach of punishment. Happens offer here. But damn, no. \nNTA. Good on you for sticking to your guns.

That would have made a bigger impact and a lasting one", "NTA", "Don't be surprised when he goes no contact.

And since you all agreed on the same punishments, the other parents are douches for relenting.", "Before anything else, obvious NTA. But while accountability is super important, in this case OP\u2019s son also needs to grow up and his brain develop more. Hopefully then he will realize what he did was wrong, but at the time he likely sees his parents as the villains, and himself as the scapegoat. For him, I doubt it\u2019s about what he did wrong. To him, his parents are the ones doing the wrong. Had his friends\u2019 parents held their ground, it may have made the intended point. But I think they lost it due to the other parents (frankly) sucking and being incredibly stupid pushovers who excuse sexual harassment. It\u2019s unfortunate. OP\u2019s son probably learned nothing. Hopefully in the future he\u2019ll understand, though. Nothing more OP can do other than to force him into therapy, maybe. At least they tried, sucks the other parents let it go.", "Yeah I feel like this kid and his friends might just grow up to be the guys who share revenge porn (posting a girls nudes after she breaks up with them, aka: a sex crime) if they aren\u2019t properly dealt with now.

Built into that is him deciding that he was wronged here, and built into that is him not accepting the magnitude of the wrong he did.\n\nI would be concerned about that as well.  It\u2019s a difficult problem, but it\u2019s something you can work on.  Is there some form of counseling that you can access?  That might be a good thing to try.", "Which is absolutely the right thing. You and your husband were 1billion% wrong and the 2 of you only have yourselves to blame if your son never forgives and wants nothing to do with the 2 of you in the future. And I hope it is what happens because it is exactly what the 2 of you deserve", "I shoulda said that that they *tried.*  Half of good parenting is sticking to their guns.  How much is nature vs.nurture?  We live in a sexist world where hatred for women and girls is pervasive and fighting it is lip service atbnest.", "It wasn\u2019t letting me comment, the server was being weird. Sheesh", "He graduated highschool already. So, if his senior prom is not a once in lifetime event, does he get to go to another senior prom?  Hmm... anyway, like I said earlier, he'll have other mile stones and events, in his life..that his parents, can't always keep him from. He'll be an adult and it would be his choice to invite them to those.", "So a candid photo?", "Gotcha OP, I appreciate the insight. All things considered, you're NTA. It's a tough lesson for your son to learn but he needs to learn it. You don't want to let him feel like he got away with something in case he ever did something similar again.", "Definately NTA OP, have you asked the Friend or their parents how they'd feel? \n\nDo they even know? I reckon their idea of punisment may be a bit more than missing a bit of a shindig. I know very little of US law but aren't these lads lucky not to be in legal trouble?\n\nEither way I'm 100% with you here OP, the other parents are doing nothing to prevent future predatory actions from their little darlings.", "NTA. The other parents are. You\u2019ll see soon the arrests will happen.", "As someone who has a younger sister that age, a snipe is slang for a quick picture, like a sniper would take a stealthy shot", "You should ask him what it means. What were the saved photos like? Do you feel like they were exposing the girls?", "Do you mean \"snaps\"? Cause that's what they're called on snapchat.", "  NTA.   I think that rates missing prom.  Possibly you could get him some counseling, as well.", "So based on the your reply and on others. I think you should have given an equally bad punishment and add strict curfew on his prom but let him go. Others here are right in that he probably won't forgive you for a long time, and it WAS a once in a lifetime event for him", "It doesn\u2019t matter? They shouldn\u2019t be taking pictures of these girls without permission let alone sharing them around. Seems like it was bikinis based on the pool mention. I\u2019d be upset regardless because that\u2019s not okay. OP said that the photos looked like the girls were unaware of them being snapped.", "Not up skirt shots but pictures of butts and boobs of the girls in \"sexual\" positions. Example being one girl bent over and one boy getting a picture of her butt while bent over and not knowing about it", "I\u2019m aware of the existence of Snapchat. What did they do?", "I don\u2019t understand what happened. I\u2019m not defending poor behavior. I literally don\u2019t understand the post", "I\u2019m not the only one asking for more information \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Ok but your country isn\u2019t in question, it\u2019s is a big deal where OP lives. She\u2019s definitely NTA but her son is probably gonna hold a grudge for the rest of his life.", "I never once said the behaviour is ok nor did I say they shouldn\u2019t be punished. They absolutely should have been punished but not allowing them to go to their senior prom is not an acceptable punishment and thankfully the other parents realised that. \nNot being allowed to go to the after party 100% agree is an acceptable punishment", "I think the punishment of not being allowed to go to his senior prom is wrong. On the other hand not being allowed to go to the after party is a perfectly reasonable punishment", "Says everyone on Reddit not intelligent enough to articulate an argument. These comments are so lazy and non-productive. My guess is you also think you\u2019ve never done anything wrong in your life.", "Oh sorry I forgot, no girl has ever done anything wrong, nothing that might cause mental health issues. Right? You\u2019re all perfect?! I suggest maybe look deeper into these issues (because they are children making mistakes) and you can\u2019t even handle the thought. If only you were half as patient with teenage boys as you were with yourself. \n\nYou\u2019re attitude just creates more toxic masculinity! Punish him! There\u2019s no other options! Then little boys learn to hate girls instead of figuring out why they develop toxic traits/habits. Instead of figuring out how they might effect someone\u2019s self esteem or mental health. A real punishment would be to find a girl willing to talk to him about how these actions effected her or man for that matter (I know you can\u2019t comprehend it, but we experience the same things). Instead we resort to lazy parenting and take something easy away and never try to figure out the problem or inflict a progressive punishment.", "I think your son needs to be \"scared straight\" about how serious of a crime he's committing by taking inappropriate pictures of women without their consent. As in, you need to make it clear that as a near adult he could have gone to jail for this and landed on the sex offender registry (which is nigh impossible to get let off from). Let alone the physical danger he places himself in if he does it to someone with a protective relative.", "Like he and his friends violated those girls by taking pictures and sharing online with out their consent.  Something those girls will live with for the rest of their lives.  His actions can never be taken back either.  Pushiment is fine.", "Nah it won\u2019t.", "Yeah, this isnt like a vacation that can be pushed back to a later date. This is a core memory and experience for literally almost every single american teenager. Ops kid will NEVER get to experience something almost everyone else he will encounter as an adult will have experienced.", "Yep, I'm not in the USA, but even I know what a huge deal the Snr Prom is, OP's relationship with her son will never be the same again, as their son will also never get another Snr Prom.", "Good. They had a perv now they don\u2019t.", "that's a ridiculous statement. he's seventeen.", "Nothing. Parents did nothing wrong.", "Lol if a son who previously liked his parents cuts them off for punishing him for being a little creep, he\u2019s a shit son in addition to being a little creep.\n\nChances are the kid will get over it within a year or two as he leaves the house and sees the difference between different peers at college based off the types of homes they come from.\n\nEdit: got blocked for this comment, but nah. What the kid did was egregious. His parents are admirable for standing their ground. If the kid hates them for life over it, that\u2019s his prerogative, but it only will reflect poorly on the kid, not the parents.", "> And I hope it is what happens because it is exactly what the 2 of you deserve\n\nI disagree with you in general, but this comment in particular is shameful.", "Your right. I shouldn\u2019t put the blame squarely on them. I was being glib.", "Ignore them. You post as much as you like.", "Lmfao if he\u2019s been to prom once already during his junior year, that negates the entire \u201conce in a lifetime!\u201d Experience. Prom is the same for both juniors and seniors usually, not really different or special. Prom is usually just for upperclassmen. Hmmmm\u2026 anyways. Also, are you literally defending them right now? Good for him! He gets to be a predator and not invite them to events, since apparently he deserves less consequences according to you guys just because it\u2019s \u201conce in a lifetime.\u201d Wild. If he\u2019s truly upset about it for the rest of his life, I would pity that he couldn\u2019t move on from a situation he caused.", "no, a creepshot. a candid photo is taken by a friend with the subject's knowledge. this is sexual harassment and a precursor to worse behaviors", "Yeah except this candid shot was of their butts and cleavage and taken in bad taste without permission. So not really a candid shot, more like a perv shot", "stealthy quick picture... yeah from what i saw that makes sense", "I dont believe these were shared to anyone outside of the 4 boys but I couldnt imagine how I'd feel if i was one of the girls and found out.", "The title of their chat was called \"snipes\"", "Why is everyone down voting this? I was just asking for clarification.", "> The boys were at the one friend's house who has a pool and had some girls over... found a snapchat group that the 4 boys made where the share \"snipes\" of girls that they've taken.\n\n\nBased on the language, it sounds like the boys were taking lewd photos of the girls without their knowledge and sharing them amongst themselves.", "What do you think they did? They took inappropriate and non-consensual pics of the girls and shared them publicly because they're sick perverts", "The boys were taking inappropriate pictures of the girls bodies at the pool. The girls were unaware they were being taken and the boys were sharing them between each other in a group chat", "he would learn nothing in that case and repeat the same behavior in the future.", "somehow even BIGGER incel energy coming from this comment", "I want to push back on this.  I went to my prom.  It\u2019s hardly what I would call a core memory.  I barely remember it.  I wouldn\u2019t even say it was the most important thing that happened to me that year - and I wouldn\u2019t have at the time, either.  I don\u2019t imagine that is a universal opinion, but I\u2019d be surprised if it\u2019s rare.\n\nI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t feel that way to him.  Because it never happened, he\u2019ll imagine the memory he would have made.\n\nAs far as memories go, I think the memory of learning that secret creep shots of you were being shared around school would be a more significant one.  It at least has the potential to cause more pain than missing out on prom, and there was no justification for what he was doing.  I think the punishment is not too much for what he did.\n\nAnother punishment might have also worked, but I think once given it was right not to rescind it.  Missing prom is painful for him, but it is not something that damages his future.\n\nThat he is thinking of himself as the victim and blaming OP tells me he hasn\u2019t learned the lesson.  I think it\u2019s worth thinking of the problem through that lens rather than guilting OP about the decision they made.  Maybe some sort of counseling is in order.", "Never went to prom and it was never something I regretted. \n\nAnd what adults still talk about prom? I can safely say the only times it\u2019s ever come up is because something crazy happened.", "Uhhh... If by \"almost every single American teenager\" you mean maybe 10%.  If prom is still a life highlight by age 21... Well, I am sorry for you.", "Very few adults I know (I'm 47) have ever discussed prom other than maybe at a high school reunion. I remember mine, but it wasn't even a highlight of my school year that year, there were many other events that were way more fun.", "Maybe he should consider that next time before he takes lewd photos of girls without their permission? Why is everyone acting like just because it\u2019s a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d (most juniors also get to go to prom) that means he deserves to go? He made his bed, now he has to lay in it.", "What if the girls were at the prom? How enjoyable would it be for them to see these predators there?", "They are shit parents for the particular punishment, not for punishing him in general", "You are entitled to your opinion just as I am entitled to mine", "OP stated he was punished for it, by not allowing him to go to prom. And it seemed that he was the only one punished for it  while the rest of his predator friends got to go to their prom. And hell, when the son is an adult that would be his choice if he invites them or not.", "From my understanding, a snipe is a term for a hot girl.", "Because saying quick snaps of hot girls vs up skirts doesn\u2019t change that either of those are terrible and neither should be happening regardless of how \u201chot\u201d the girl is\n\nIt\u2019s the way the question was phrased. You could have said, was it just dumb pictures of their girl friends, or was it like upskirts? That\u2019s a way better way to ask for clarification", "Cause people are dumb\ud83d\ude02", "exactly this.", "I have no evidence that these were shared anywhere outside the 4 of them, so I am not going to assume they did. But this is bad enough.", "I don\u2019t know.", "Bull", "I just wrote almost the same thing as your first half, and I completely agree with your second half too.", "Lololol. Look at this guy who has no core memories before adulthood", "Yup, with you there! Don't know USA laws but surely pictures of a minor taken without their permission could land the kid in serious legal trouble?\n\nAll of the little sods have got off extremely easily if you ask me, wonder what the girls parents would think?", "Exactly! Never mind the disrespect he showed those girls. The violation he committed. The peace of mind and safety that they will never get back. Not to mention their photos were shared online even in just their group they are still out there.  He's lucky he isn't facing potential criminal charges.", "No, no, their relationship is ruined FOREVER. What\u2019s with the dramatics over prom? It seems like a huge deal to him now but I assume he is going to college in the fall (probably paid by his parents, who he will NEVER forgive) and high school stuff will have very little significance then.", "she's a shit parent because she doesn't want her son to grow up to be a predator?", "Lmfao, he literally was taking photos of young girls boobs and butts without their knowledge and you think them taking away senior prom (and he likely had it his junior year) makes them shit parents for something so serious? I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t do worse and wouldn\u2019t blame them if they did.", "That\u2019s not their fault that the other parents backed out. They shouldn\u2019t change just because the other parents are okay with their kids being predators. I\u2019d rather my kid hate me forever and learn not to be a pervert creep than allow them to feel like that\u2019s appropriate. As I\u2019ve seen some great parents say, \u201cI love you enough to let you hate me,\u201d when giving a well deserved punishment. Some parents deserve to be hated, but I was literally just pointing out it\u2019s not once in a lifetime if all upperclassmen get it. The reality is he\u2019s probably already been once his junior year. He made bad decisions which lead to him not going senior year. If he can\u2019t get it when he\u2019s older, that\u2019s on him.", "Regardless, it's strongly implied that the photos were very inappropriate. That's technically a crime.", "Thanks, I appreciate that.", "Sure I do.  I even have vague memories of prom and the girls I took.  I just have a lot more memories of hs football games, backroad driving, hanging out in a basement being stupid... To speak not of college. You know, memories of fun stuff.  But hey, you peaked the first time you got to play dress up, mazel tov!  I'm happy for you!", "Maybe! It changes depending on the state I think. Still immoral though, obviously", "Yeah, some people in this thread are acting like it was them taking a photo of a cat or something. This is a human being with feelings and they treated those girls like sex objects. And people think he still deserves to go because it\u2019s a \u201conce in a lifetime experience.\u201d Well hell, if OP and dad let him continue doing crap like this, he\u2019s going to get a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d trip to jail.", "My senior prom was during CovID, so I didn\u2019t have an official one. But my and my partners parents threw a \u201cpromdemic\u201d (when seeing limited people was okay and after months of isolation) for us at home. Honestly it was way better! I got to be with the one person I truly cared about, not a bunch of strangers. It was way more special haha. I went to regular prom the year before and barely remember anything but watching tik tok. \n\nI get that people think prom is a big deal but honestly it\u2019s not.

My son pulled way worse, stupid shit and let's just say my punishments were far worse. He finally got it when he couldn't get out of a situation because they screwed up BIG TIME.", "Exactly, those boys took something from those girls they can never get back too.  And that can have lasting trauma.", "Agreed; I was being sarcastic. People are acting like his parents are sending him to jail or something. Besides the necessity of following through on a punishment for it to have the desired effect on behaviour, it\u2019s just a high school dance you get particularly dressed up for. It wasn\u2019t even my favourite high school dance. Then he will go to college and go to parties and bars that have alcohol and no chaperones and get over it. And, you know, hopefully learn his lesson.", "I'm sarcastic af so I can't believe I missed that. Lol"]}
