Afterwards, we all ended up back at our place to throw on some warmer clothes before heading out to grab another pint. At this point the GF indicated that she was tired and wasn\u2019t going to join us, and that buddy and I are on our own. At this point, it\u2019s ~12am.\n\nBuddy and I ended up walking to a bar down the street, where we had a single pint and chatted until ~1:30am\n\nI messaged the GF when we were walking back to keep her in the loop.

Yikes. Unless there\u2019s something you\u2019re not saying (e.g., history of infidelity, etc), this is bizarre.\n\nBut the bigger issue here isn\u2019t the curfew or anything related to it, it\u2019s her unwillingness to have a conversation. Her \u201cI\u2019m done talking about this\u201d is unacceptable. She may not have to validate her feelings, but she is acting like HER feelings invalidate yours. All that said, this sounds like a major communication issue. Her desire to control you over what sounds like a very infrequent thing and then refusing to discuss it would be a big red flag for me.", "NTA at all.  And treasure this time.  When you are around 35, you will suddenly shut down around midnight and be unable to function.  haha   A few years ago, I had to be driven home from an after hours club.  I had not been drinking but was so damn tired, I couldn't figure out how to drive.  LOL\n\nSeriously, though, this is super controlling behavior.", "NTA \n\nShe's not your mommy and you're not a dog on a leash. \n\nYou're an adult who's been in a relationship for over 3 years. \n\nTime to have a conversation about where your relationship is headed. Marriage? Kids? Get these issues ironed out now if you're planning on having a family together or it's doomed. You gotta be on the same page.", "This is controlling behavior and it will only get worse.", "NTA on all accounts. \n\nYou both are fully functioning adults with the ability to make decisions on your own. Imo, nobody should be giving you a curfew except your parents when you're living under their roof. She is not your mother, she is your girlfriend. As you said, this is not a constant, rather once a month type thing. \n\nAnd why is she policing the way you have fun? She can have fun with her girlfriends her way (however infrequent that might be) and you can have fun with your friends in your way. She is not providing a valid reason for you to not be out late. Her whole argument is \"you're not in college anymore\". Who says you can't party like it is college? My 58 y.o. father is still attending 4 day long music festivals from noon until 11PM, and he gets kudos for it. I don't see why this would be an issue. It would be one thing if you're going out and getting absolutely wasted until 2-3AM every single night, but that's not what you're doing. \n\nAlso, this is a bit of a red flag to me personally. Her unwillingness to explain the issue and talk it out with you now could lead to lack of communication in the future. She refuses to explain her wishes when you just want to understand where she's coming from. She says \"you don't understand\", but how can she expect you to without explaining it to you? She says \"I'm done talking about this\", but she never talked about it to start with. She can't just make a rule for you (a seemingly stupid one at that) expecting you to follow it blindly. You're her boyfriend, her equal, not her child and not her slave. \n\nNTA. Your GF is.", "NTA.  She is being ridiculous.  Especially when she won't discuss the issue.  As long as you aren't drinking and driving, or overindulging, 2 am every few months is not outrageous. \nI'm  many decades past your ages and still have late nights like 2 or 3 am every few months.", "You are not a child, and you shouldn't need anyone's permission to spend a late night with a friend once in a while. Her desire to control you is wildly unhealthy. NTA.", "NTA. Her behavior sounds extremely controlling. You\u2019re young, have no kids, why wouldn\u2019t you enjoy staying out late with your friends sometimes? This is a big red flag, and an even bigger red flag is her unwillingness to discuss it at all.", "NTA, this is weird and controlling.", "Someone's jealous of you hanging out with friends. There could be a whole host of reasons why she feels that way but that's what I'm betting on. Probably has nothing to do with the time.\n\nEDIT. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI think you should push to resolve this.  Your comment about her isolating herself from her friends sounds worrisome.", "\"I'm done talking about this\" is something you should only say when you can accept the status quo, not when you're demanding changes.\n\nThis level of communication avoidance will eventually destroy your relationship.\n\nNTA. My husband is a fifty year old white collar professional and still enjoys late night events a few times a year.", ">Her concern is that I should have no business nor interest in being out beyond 11:00, as my college days are long behind me. And that when I am out late, it shows we are on different paths and that it makes her feel like she\u2019s back in college; like she\u2019s my \u201croommate rather than teammate\u201d and \u201cit feels like we\u2019re living different lives\u201d.\n\nNo offense, but the therapy speak feels manipulative here. Your girlfriend is couching shit in the sort of thing you'd hear from a therapist, but what she's basically saying is, \"if you loved me you wouldn't do this.\" \n\nThe fact that she is dismissively not interacting with you on the subject and declaring, \"we've already discussed this\" is not actually how couples communicate. It's ironic that she says you're treating her like a roommate, because that's how she's choosing to communicate here. Rather than treat a subject as open for discussion she's shutting down the discussion and refusing to engage, which a \"team mate\" doesn't do, because team mates are willing to discuss things further for the sake of understanding and possible compromise if necessary.\n\nAll of her interactions seem very \"my way or the highway\" but phrased in that seemingly thoughtful speak you get from therapy circles, hence why I called it \"therapy speak.\" This makes her seem less thoughtful and more like she realizes the air of seeming thoughtful is more useful to her than actually being thoughtful.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe is 1,000% in the wrong here. First off, it's not as if you're coming home at 3am every week. Second, As long as you're working, doing your part around the house, and contributing to bills, she shouldn't have a problem. I'll also say that she's a giant ah for thinking that she \"doesn't have to validate why she feels the way she does\"..... You're not asking her to validate anything. You're asking her to CLARIFY why she thinks that you shouldn't be out late. She likes to imply that by being out late, you're acting \"like you're still in college\".... AKA \"You're being immature\". Fact is, someone that refuses to explain their feelings on a subject and also refusing to have an adult conversation (\"I'm done talking about this\") is the one who's being immature.", "NTA\n\nRefusing to have a discussion is a very childish action. She cannot be critical of you for not growing up to her standard. She is acting like a seven-year-old. \n\nShe didn't even tell you when she expected you back. You are not a mind reader and two hours isn't that long. I would have been surprised had you returned within an hour if I were your partner. She cannot expect you to meet expectations she doesn't tell you about. \n\nBeing out late once in a while is normal. I'm about to turn 37 and I'm out late nearly once a week. I'm a proper adult with a proper adult partner. \n\nYou did everything right and she is still upset. She said you could go out. You went out. You texted on your way back.\n\nHopefully, living with her is opening your eyes to the kind of person she really is.\n\nETA: I didn't say this before, but I think she is emotionally abusive. Shutting down and not discussing things. Blaming you for everything. Being mad about stuff you couldn't have known would result in anger. \n\nDoes she ever take responsibility for mistakes? Does she apologize when she is wrong? Does she eventually have the conversations she wouldn't at the time? What I mean is, do you revisit the topics or just pretend like nothing ever happened?", "NTA. You're an adult and can do whatever you want. She's just being a control freak and needs to learn that relationships don't work like that.", "I'm a homebody but do you bro. Partners shouldn't control each other like that. Maybe just tell her how late you will be out til.", "NTA, but now I'm curious. I have had a similar issue with a bf in the past. However the circumstances were different, this was an almost nightly thing, past 2am, with lost of cheating and drugs and lies. My ex would always claim he didn't care for those thibgs but basically ditched me every chance he got for.. those very things. Maybe she is spending alot of time at home due to other issues she is currently facing and overthinking, which might be making her paranoid. But this is just my own 2 cents. NTA. The conversation needs to take place especially if you are trying to communicate through your problems..", "NTA. Her reasoning is very strange: You're not in college anymore so you have to be home by 11? You stay out late once in a while and that makes her no more than a roommate? She doesn't want to go out late with her friends, so you shouldn't either?\n\nShe thinks it's okay to make these demands and judgment calls, then refuses to discuss it? \"I'm done talking about this\" are the words of someone who knows they don't have a leg to stand on. \n\nIt's also worrying that she's not seeing much of her own friends anymore. It seems she's planning to make you her whole world and wants you to reciprocate. That's not a good relationship. It's more like a hostage situation.\n\nWhen I was married, my husband frequently went out without me. I didn't care how late he stayed out. All I wanted was an estimate as to what time he'd be home so I'd know when to start worrying. (no mobile phones at the time.)", "NTA \n\nYou are a grown adult who has every right to his own life and free time. \n\nMy hubby could be out all night, he messages me if they change location or if the plans change because we communicate and it puts my anxiety at ease knowing where he is for safety reasons but I couldn't care when he gets home as long as he gets home safe. We have children so if we have agreed on plans the next day with kids I expect him to be responsible and not super hungover the next day leaving me to care for the kids as well as him. \n\nWhen I get nights out he encourages me to stay out as long as possible because I very rarely have the opportunity and need the time to myself/ not at home with kids.", "NTA I\u2019m 42, bf is 40, and we will shut the bars down and go to after parties. Not always, but decently regularly.  We work long hours and like to enjoy our nights out. Even if we\u2019re not out together we give each other the freedom to enjoy our time with our friends. There\u2019s times we\u2019re in different states, or one has to work when the other doesn\u2019t the next morning, and all we expect of each other is not to drive after drinking and to let the other one know we make it in safely. And that\u2019s just because we\u2019ve had nights out that crazy shit has happened. It\u2019s literally just a concern for each other\u2019s well-being. Please enjoy your younger years and don\u2019t let somebody being controlling make you resent them or ruin your fun.", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend is a nut.", "NTA - you\u2019re an adult. People like her need to marry a preacher. Lol.", "I'm probably going to get lambasted, but NAH. Coming from the perspective of the wife whose in bed by 11pm whose married to the man whose been known to stay out till 4am, I honestly think this could just be growing pains of living with a partner. When my husband and I first moved in together I was shocked at how late he could stay out and it honestly bothered me. I have anxiety, so I can't sleep if I'm waiting for him to get home, or I'll scare the shit out of myself if I'm asleep and hear the door open. I hated waiting for him to come, not knowing if I should stay up or go to bed. I also used to feel like he was prioritizing drinking and acting like a teenager over spending time with me. \n\nWhile yes these were \"me problems\", we still discussed how I felt and how he felt (his friends are his family and their main hobby was drinking and he didn't want to lose his friends) and we made compromises. The main solution being if my husband goes out, I'll ask him if he'll be out \"late.\" Late means, are you going to be out past midnight? If yes, then I'm aware I'll be going to be going to sleep alone, I take a melatonin and snuggle with the cat and call it a night. Just knowing what to expect has eased my anxiety so much. I don't know if something like that might be helpful in your relationship, but it could be worth a shot.", "Well if it\u2019s been twice in two months and you are only living together 5 months for her it may not be a huge leap to assume that you  would partake in this behaviour a lot more. She only has 5 months experience of living with you. Everyone is on their best behaviour in the first few months of living together and then let their guard down. Perhaps that\u2019s what she is afraid of ?? Unless she talks to you about it you are both going to be polar opposites on this though. And rather than just defend your position you need to be questioning hers more . Good luck and make the most of the 20 something energy where you can stay out late drinking and not feel like death warmed up the next morning :)", "YTA \n\nYou live together. You just don't go out drinking until 2am with your partner at home. It's maybe okay to do once in a blue moon, with some warning.", "NAH. You two are not a match.", "More ESH and your story is so stereotypical it\u2019s laughable.  it sounds like she\u2019s communicating her feelings maturely and clearly and you\u2019re not listening , or empathizing and instead trying to debate her so she\u2019s shutting that down. \n\nAs someone who partied a bit into my 30s I wish I hadn\u2019t. I wish I\u2019d focused on health and building a foundation with a partner. \n\nNOTHING good happens after 12. That\u2019s when people get drunk enough to start the moves on taking each other home and honestly why do you need to be out that late with the lads? \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s on the path to settle in and nest as a couple and you still want to stay out all hours with the boys. She sounds more mature than you and like you\u2019re stuck wanting to be a boy with your college bros. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d be annoyed too and she\u2019s right it does seem like you are going different directions in your lives. She did communicate that clearly as well. \n\nAlso I didn\u2019t see her impose a curfew at all I saw her explain how she felt and give examples so you\u2019re taking her communication of her feelings and concerns and spinning the story to your own advantage to get validation she\u2019s controlling. This is so typical. \n\nYou can do what you want, she might grow out of wanting to cope those qualities in a partner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hell, I'm 52, hubs is 60 and we can still go out for a night of proper partying until well past 2am when the mood takes us. Er, well, s'long as we don't need to function before afternoon the next day, but still. \n\nIt's also a bit concerning that your GF refuses to have a rational conversation about it with you. If she's so hung up on acting 'age appropriate' then you'd think she'd know how to communicate like an adult that ya know, isn't in college anymore...", "Curfew?!? You\u2019re a grown man! Tell that asshole to pound salt.", "NTA your wife sucks", "NTA, tell her that you are an adult and will not have a curfew; no other discussion necessary. I do not think she will like that very much, but can see how it feels.", "NTA. I\u2019m a 31 year old mother of small children, and I still get nights out without curfews. So does my husband. \nGoing out once in a while to have fun doesn\u2019t make you any less responsible.", "NTA She's not your parent.", "NTA", "NTA. \nI'm late 30s, my husband late 50s. We both get home after various social activities around 2am several times a year.  Sometimes we are together, other times the other person gets to enjoy the house to themselves for the evening.", "NTA. It's controlling behavior. But a 2 cent question. Is she in therapy? You said in another comment that she was raised in a religious household. Were they strict and controlling with her? My household wasn't religious but very controlling. I'm 30 and live alone and I still feel guilty and paranoid if I stay out past 11 or I stop by a store on the way home from work without texting and informing someone. Is she projecting from her own irrational anxiety?", "NTA, overcontrolling", "NTA - but maybe try to think if there might be any things that you aren't recognizing about your behavior.  For example: \n\n* Is it that you have limited weekend time, and you are hungover the next day, so she ends up doing more than her share of the chores.  Sometimes inequality in division of labor around the house causes resentment when one partner does \"fun\" things.  And the resentment isn't really about the partner doing the \"fun\" things, it is about the division of labor.  The \"fun\" thing just highlight the unequal distribution for the partner.    \n* Or could it be that you are hungover the next day and just MISERABLE to be around?  Is she a morning person?  Do you have morning weekend rituals (like semi-regular Sunday brunch) that a hangover might be impacting?  \n* Or could it be that it is impacting your work (if this is happening on weeknights and you have to work the next morning)?  She mentioned that she doesn't feel like you are on the same path.  Could she mean that you aren't moving forward, and she feels like your drinking is holding you back?      \n* Or could it be that you do really stupid shit and/or get blackout drunk?  It didn't sound like it from your description, but if you are coming home and pissing the bed or breaking things, then even going once a month might be too often.\n\nAgain, I'm saying NTA.  And spending time with friends is important.  You should do what you enjoy while you can.  I have two kids now and it makes things WAY more complicated.   But I'm also saying think about whether there is potentially another related reason she is upset.", "NTA by default because you're never the asshole for disagreeing with limits someone is attempting to impose on your behavior.  If their limits are totally reasonable, it either signals incompatibility,  or that you may have issues.\n\nIn your case a GF is behaving like mom, which is very much *not* reasonable.  It's because she's jealous and insecure and thinks control is the way to protect herself.\n\nRun from that", "NTA, she sounds depressed, but thats no excuse.", "NTA, relationships are give and take. You don\u2019t get told to do anything, you solve problems together.", "NTA It would be understandable to have a discussion if you were an alcoholic or addict and putting yourself in environments that are likely to tempt a relapse. Or if you were repeatedly missing events with her to go out drinking late with mates.", "It took me too many years to not allow myself to be bullied. \nDon't be me.", "Is she your girlfriend or your mother? \nNTA. \n\nThis is super controlling and a red flag. In what other ways does she try to make unilateral decisions or is otherwise controlling?", "NTA. Maybe her personality is to shut down in stressful situations and internalize things? (Im like that from time to time XD) Though she\u2019s probably just giving a scenario when she mentioned that you\u2019re not a college student anymore. BUT putting that aside, it\u2019s best that you talk to each other. Set a house rule, for example, talk about the matter in ALL HONESTY/ be blunt and the way it felt before the day ends/night ends (how my husband and I settle matters, it\u2019s never good to let it stew). Let her speak first, maybe she needs time to rant. When you gave her time to speak, tell her about what you felt as well and not let her interrupt you while you speak. Find a way to compromise. It\u2019s a part of living together. ^_^\n\nIf she kept on refusing to speak about it, tell her then this will never get resolve and both of you will feel miserable as time goes by. \n\nIf she says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t need to explain or validate why she feels the way she does\u201d, tell her you are not asking for an explanation and she doesn\u2019t need to validate, all you need is for the ability to understand her and that by talking about it will get you to understand her feelings more. The way you see things and do things are different. I recommend finding about your personality and her personality and talk about it. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA obviously. That is insanely controlling behavior, and I'd be seriously considering whether I want to continue dating this person.", "I\u2019m 47, married 22 years and oh man, the last time I stayed out past 2 am\u2026 was actually only a few weeks ago, when friends from college were in town. My husband encouraged me to go and told me to have fun. \n\nUnless your late nights are frequently causing issues in other ways, this does seem pretty controlling. It might come from jealousy since you seem to have more or closer friends than she does. But there\u2019s no official age where you have to stop having late nights with friends.", "NTA\n\nThis is red flag behavior on several counts:\n\n1. She's treating you like a child.

Do you plan dates for her? Do you still put effort into the relationship in other ways even though you\u2019ve been together a long time? Sometimes people get too comfortable in relationships. Sometimes people get annoyed about things like their partner staying out late,  but it\u2019s because they are actually feeling neglected in the relationship. If the love tank is full and you have actively filled your partners love tank as they should do for you also then i don\u2019t think she should have a problem with you staying out late from time to time. But if she if feeling neglected then maybe that\u2019s why she is nit picking this issue and it\u2019s not actually about the issue at all! But just wanting to know she\u2019s important to you and a priority. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t stay out late. I\u2019m saying maybe look at a bigger perspective and think about other ways you can show her she\u2019s important and a priority. \n\nIt also might be helpful if you set your own curfew and communicate this with her. That way she knows what to expect. Better to under promise and over deliver than over promise and under deliver though! So if you think you will be back at 2am say you will be back at 3am so you end up coming home early, rather than say you\u2019ll be back at 2am and then coming back at 2:30am, that way psychologically she will feel like you are coming home early, not later than expected. It helps set the right expectations, because she is already setting her own expectation in her mind of when you might be home.

You're out drinking with a buddy what does time matter as long as you're happy and safe and not doing it all the time as that could leave your gf feeling \"neglected\". Which brings me onto my next point, you gf sounds quite controlling if she's making this demand but not feeling the need to explain her feelings properly. \nI would reassure her that she is still a priority in your life and some nights out end up with people staying out late, that's just how it is... some of the best nights out end at 4am but trust me, once you're in your 30s you will probably burn out around 1am haha. \nAnyway, good luck to you bro and always make sure you're living a happy full life!", "Wow NTA.

Somewhere in your late thirties or early forties, your ability to remain lucid, and awake, much past eleven o'clock disappears.

Thank you kind stranger for being receptive to a different point of view \n\nI took it into my mid 30s. I\u2019m 40 now. \n\nIt was unfortunate because honestly in retrospect I did it because I was lonely and seeking connection and that was the easiest way. I am not even friends with these buddies anymore. The only thing we had in common was drinking and if I see them it just leads to that path. \n\nI also wasn\u2019t living to my values and I think that impacted my ability to form a healthy relationship and start a family at a decent age. Looking back I really regret it because every single mistake I made life or relationship wise also involved drinking.\n\nit took watching multiple friends start to age from alcohol consumption and have some heavy health problems (and feel my body go from 0-60 much more quickly when it came to getting drunk) to kick my ass in gear.  Even then it\u2019s a struggle to get back in shape now because I\u2019m older and I just regret prioritizing that path. It was short term gains and fun that took away from the long term goal and I didn\u2019t see it until later. \n\nI honestly think if I\u2019d just focused on cooking well and being active and some healthy connection with friends I\u2019d have way more money and have found happiness sooner. \n\nI also don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve stopped unless I met a partner who has to be sober because of their choices and wanting to support them. And I had just turned 37 and was and really lonely by then. All my friends were either married or older and still doing the same thing. I knew I didn\u2019t want to be single at 55 downing a bottle of wine by myself out to dinner. \n\nThen seeing my partners parent deal with multiple alcohol related hospitalizations and continue to drink. Alcohol can really be nasty to your body over time if you\u2019re drinking a lot (a lot can be once in a while and and binge /more than 5, or a couple every day). \n\nI wanted to settle down so many times and I think my continuing to want to hold on to that life also sabotaged it. I let someone really special get away and I regret it to this day. I just didn\u2019t know how or didn\u2019t know another way and I didn\u2019t have too many friends to support me in that journey. Plus I\u2019m very social, and so it was just hard. \n\nHonestly i didn\u2019t realize it until I was older but as you get to 30 and 40 it\u2019s more about how well you took care of yourself, a few close friends, and some great experiences. These things like being out late do catch up. \n\nMy parents don\u2019t drink and didn\u2019t really drink much growing up and they look and act 15 years younger than my parents at 70. \n\nYour GF might be more concerned about some future future things and like she trusts you but it\u2019s optics or she wants to play house honestly. Who knows.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s wondering why you preferred to be out late with boys and weren\u2019t missing her in bed. Some girls appreciate a guy who looks around at midnight and thinks \u201cI don\u2019t need to be here anymore because I have the best thing at home waiting for me, I\u2019m going to be with her.\u201d And it\u2019s worth wondering why you didn\u2019t feel that way. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s just uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t know why exactly. Maybe even just checking in or sharing your location if you stay out later could help. Just talk a bit more, ask questions, try to rephrase in an effort to understand and then sit with it for a while before offering your thought or opinion.\n\nThen think about how to explain your needs. Maybe for you it isn\u2019t  about staying out late but wanting some solo social time with your boys since you two are always together you want to make sure you bring in balance and still have friendships and don\u2019t become co dependent.
