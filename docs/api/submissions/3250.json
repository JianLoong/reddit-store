Former picky eater here, I didn't want to try anything. I still struggle to try new things, but that is not what this is about. If, like me, it's some weird anxiety doing it, tell her about it. Opening up with her can lead to a fun way to explore into new foods in a safe way. \n\nYour girl was nervous, and instead of just comforting her, you made it about how you won't support her.

The world is filled with interesting, horizon-broadening things that have nothing to do with food. Not everyone is a foodie.\n\nBut, if you have a thing where lots of normal food repulses you, it's on you to plan ahead and prevent situations like this one to unfold.

It was salmon. \n\nI *hated* salmon. Or so I thought. Can you imagine?
