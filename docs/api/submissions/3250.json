If you eat,  you cook.", "yup, it mathers why. Him dumping the cooking on her does not make him look good either. \n\nbut really, if he is allergic or has moral objections, offcourse he is n t a. i am vegatarian, i would not taste a meat dish, and it would be rude to ask me too.\n\nNow i know i hate eggplant, the flavor , the context, the smell. if i was locked in a room with eggplant dishes and meat dishes, i don't know what i would go for after 3 days off not eating. It would be pointless to me to try a eggplant dish, as i 10000% know i would hate it. does not mather if worlds best chef prepared it. would still be n t a / n a h depending if SO knew the dislike.\n\nthen there is the option of just never trying anything out off habit. in that case you can get over it, as you might like it. The fact his family encouraged him to try, makes me feel allergic is not likely. And then, since you asked her to cook, he should try. Since she went true the effort, and the rest seem to like it.", "He's not saying no to any of those things, he's saying no to pie... Just pie. He's not saying he's going to an orphan murderer from now on. He just doesn't want pie. What entitles anyone to his reasoning or opinion on what. All that matters is he doesn't want it. But he's already given them the reason why, it just wasn't good enough for them.\n\nI'm a picky eater and if someone offers me something and I say no thank you, I'm not saying, please ask me why I don't want it, or repeatedly ask me to try it. I'm saying I don't want it. So many people with entitlement issues and an inability to take things as they are.", ">What entitles anyone to his reasoning or opinion on what.\n\nHis relationship with his girlfriend entitles her to communication.\n\nHis posting in a subreddit that is specifically for the purpose of communicating a situation and being judged entitles us to his reasoning.", "Which he has already given. He's a picky eater. He knows what he likes and there's things he doesn't want. There's his reason. There's his communication. He gave it. It just wasn't good enough for her, that's a her problem, not him.", ">There's his communication. He gave it\n\nActually, no. Read the post. Nowhere does he say he communicated thats hes a picky eater and thats why he wouldnt try it.\n\nHes says \"she knows im a picky guy\". No mention that hes ever actually communicated that to her. He doesnt even bother to clarify that she knows hes a picky *eater*. Just \"oh she knows im a picky guy\".\n\nRemember, we arent disagreeing about the verdict - this thread is an I N F O request. You started by arguing he shouldnt even elaborate.", "Actually, yes... He said she knows he's picky. She knows. How would she know if there had been no communication?\n\n\nIf she doesn't know we're being lied to and its no better than a troll post. His reasoning was that he doesn't want it. If someone doesn't want something don't force it on them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f What's so hard about respecting people's boundaries, not pushing them because of your own issues and self esteem. She just shifted her feeling shitty onto him. Like I said, I'm picky, I don't want people questioning me about why I don't like certain foods. I don't like it, I don't want it. That's where I leave it. This man is entitled to the same. The same as his partner would be if she didn't want something."]}
