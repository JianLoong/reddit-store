The ex is not saying she is retracting consent for back when the images were being made, but instead for their continnued existance and use. This is not like saying you didn't want sex after all, this is like consenting to sex and then halfway trough telling your partner to stop as it doesnt feel good anymore. Or more accuratly, consenting to sex with your partner, breaking up and years later figuring out they never took their dick out of your vagina and asking them to still do so.", "Legally no, but morally yes.

It's disrespectful to your ex and to the trust/vulnerability you shared in those moments to keep them when they've expressed clear discomfort with you still having them.", "What reason do you have to keep them? Are you going to go back and watch them and use them?  I personally find it creepy to think about my ex fantasizing about me when we are now broken up. You lost access to the sexual part of him when you broke up. \n\nRegardless of how you answer that, anything sexual requires consent. The most important part of consent is that it must be conscious, enthusiastic, ongoing, informed, and can be revoked at any time. He\u2019s revoked his consent to you having those pictures.

But he no longer consents, so it\u2019s just basic decency to delete them. I feel like you are treating this like a pissing contest with his fianc\u00e9e by not honoring his request and telling him to lie to her.

I don\u2019t have naked pictures of my friends.\n They were taken when you were together, in the context of your relationship. That relationship is over, you don\u2019t have a right to keep them.

Just pointing out how there is nothing illegal about her holding onto those photos/videos.", "Have you ever had pictures of them?", "Ahhh, yes, well I guess a lot of times I put morally correct up there with legal, though they can be very different. \n\nOh, 100%, it's weird. I have so many questions! WHY does OP's ex even know that OP still has the pictures? This seems like a very intimate conversation to have. It also seems like a quite improper one to be having when the ex is engaged. \n\nHow did the conversation happen between the ex and fianc\u00e9? Why did the ex even share they knew this information with their fianc\u00e9? \n\nI would hope, as a fianc\u00e9, that my soon to be husband doesn't even know if his ex still has sexual pictures and videos.

Why do you know that information?!", "It's obvious that the quote you're referring to is about *ongoing* matters that are sexual nature, not something like sex that ends. Jfc, use your brain.", "You know exactly what that meant. Playing dumb and complaining about the semantics doesn't help your argument", "You're not actually that stupid, you're intentionally misunderstanding the point.", "Well, since you wanna do some whataboutism, you\u2019re talking about a sexual act that has ended.

Please don't be scared of that, no judge, aquaintence of yours or member of the public would ever think that constitutes rape. No person that isnt psychotic would believe they've been raped if they regretted having consensual sex a couple days later. Honestly, your comment is some incell bullsh*t.\n\nI believe she's saying \"anytime the sexual act is still going on\" and I'm trying to explain that what OP describes is something for which consent can be retracted as it is still going on.", "FFS, you need to work on your god damned reading comprehension. Holy. Shit!!!!", "Downvoted for agreeing and making a clear point about the legality \ud83d\ude29 Reddit is just\u2026wow", "Yes. My best friend is an ex. When that relationship ended, so did the consent for me to have those. Even if she never asked me to delete them, it\u2019s called decency. They aren\u2019t some CGI nudes, that photo is of a body that belongs to someone else. Something intimate and private that they shared with you alone, and which were sent in a different context that no longer applies.", "Right! Why would the ex even bring up those photos/videos with the fianc\u00e9 and then have the logical next step be to approach someone else about the past photos/videos?! I delete my old photos, assume the other did the same, and then move onto to the next relationship. The fact the photos are even coming up at all brings up so many questions haha. OP should delete those photos/videos for her own growth, and the ex and fianc\u00e9 should take a chill pill as well.", "Agreed and I'm giving you an award for this comment!!\n\nIt'll help HER move on to delete!!", "Thanks! Ya moving on in a healthy way should be her mindset regardless of what\u2019s technically right or wrong"]}
