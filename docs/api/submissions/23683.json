We had a big wedding, welcome guest party the day before, brunch, etc. all covered by us. My husband\u2019s aunts on one side and all of his cousins came (9 people total) and did not even get us a card. \n\nWe have gone to multiple weddings for people in this family and have paid for our flights, hotels (some were destinations), and given at least $300 every time. It honestly made me sick to my stomach when we saw that they didn\u2019t get us a literal $2 cvs card. My husband was bummed for a minute but then just got over it (he\u2019s an \u201coh well\u201d kinda guy with pretty much anything). \n\nMy husband recently said they were all catching up over text and asked us to go on a cruise with them in march, saying they would love to see us. I told my husband I\u2019m not comfortable with that after what happened with the gifts at our wedding. He scoffed and said that no one necessarily deserves a wedding present and we should be happy they came. Personally, these are not really people I want to be close with - I image that we will get stuck paying for everything (as we have in the past) since there is just little care. I feel like they tend to often be selfish and use us for things and I don\u2019t really want to spend my money and vacation time on a cruise with them versus doing something else. A lunch, fine, but not a whole vacation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that I need an expensive gift. One guest brought us these wine glasses that she found at a thrift store for $4 and they are beautiful and one of my favorite gifts!! Not only are they beautiful, but you can tell how much thought she put into the gift and wrapping. It\u2019s that they came and didn\u2019t even bother to get us a card or really wish us well. It just feels disrespectful.\n\nMy husband is upset with me and says he can\u2019t really go by himself since it\u2019s all couples. We\u2019re at an impasse.

For me, gifts aren\u2019t a requirement to go to a wedding. Is it nice that someone wants to give extra to the couple on their special day? Absolutely. But is that something you should wallow in? No. \n\nHowever, by the sounds of it, these family members are just opportunists and want an extra ATM on their vacay and aren\u2019t even people you\u2019re necessarily close with. I get they\u2019re part of your husbands family and you want to be there for him, but you shouldn\u2019t force yourself to be around people that you feel are using you both. So, for that definition NTAH. \n\nI would say, if this is something your husband really wants, then there need to be hard boundaries and conditions and he needs to relay those to his family that he is 100% in support of those boundaries as your partner.", "NTA. If I were being used like a cash cow on vacation I\u2019d never vacation again with those relatives. And as for the wedding issue\u2026I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be on the same page as you. Horribly rude to not even give a card. So rude. As you said, it\u2019s not the amount, it\u2019s the thought. I\u2019d be irritated at my husband for being blas\u00e9 about it. Stand your ground and refuse to go.", "I don't understand the whole \"come with a present\" thing. Ok, it's tradition, it's customary, but why is it tradition? I don't need to get pretty junk from my family to know they care about me. But hey maybe I'm the weird one.", "NTA \n\nYour reasoning wasn the gifts, but that they always use you.

Thanks again for your thoughtful generosity \u201c", "Frankly, it seems petty to do this over a wedding gift. Plus, people and families can be very different about weddings. Some give generous gifts, and others feel that paying for the flights/hotel/expenses to attend IS their gift. If having these family members at the wedding made your husband happy and HE doesn\u2019t care about a gift, why should you?\n\nYWBTA if you hung onto this. Let it go.

Even if they don't have much money to buy a gift they could have at least given you a card. On the other hand, they can afford a cruise so it sounds like they could have afforded a gift. I would not go on a cruise with them. I can totally see that they would take advantage of you and get you to pay things for them. I certainly wouldn't want to use my money and vacation time, which is precious, to go on a cruise with them. Tell your husband that you would prefer to have a romantic vacation alone with him.

Aren't you just happy to have had your family celebrate with you?\n\nYou seem exhausting and materialistic ($4 wine glasses not withstanding).", "NTA it isn't about money, it's about consideration.

Wanna catch up on a cruise?\" isn't the reddest flag on money matters, I very much admire some folks faith in humanity.", "It\u2019s honestly not about the wedding gift. That\u2019s just on the surface. Underneath it\u2019s about them taking advantage of you and then disrespecting you. And you are correct, OP.

I think slight YTA.\n\nYour behavior and reasoning puts your husband in the very awkward position of either lying about the cancelation reason or, worse, telling them you won't go because they didn't buy you a wedding gift. \n\nPersonally, I get your annoyance, but you're being kinda petty. Go on the cruise, but don't pay a red cent for anybody else.", "YTA. You are awfully old to be \u201cneeding\u201d wedding gifts.

Are you like my cousin who had a massively expensive wedding in a city 5 hours away from where anyone on either side lived? That cost attendees 1-1.5k apiece to attend? If so, suck it up, you burned your gift budget. If not, they suck.", "NTA\n\nThey sound kind of moochy.", "A lot of couples get married fairly young. Marriages, even cheap ones, are expensive. Just the cost to feed family can be nuts. Especially with older family, the point of the gift is to help you start your marriage on the best possible foot, so they give gifts to offset the cost of food they ate and to help the couple with things they may not be able to afford yet, considering being young.", "I agree with Runns. However, a cruise with family can be very intense. I can understand you wanting more alone time as a couple.", "Its not his whole family. Its certain people in his family. She not making him pick. She choosing not to go and he refuses to go without her.", "I agree with this - I do not think OP presented her case as well as you did.", "Just say op pto didn\u2019t get approved. Easy answer", "I had friends that got married in their 40s and they only asked for people to be present because they were in the second part of their lives.", "My fiance and I are in the middle of planning out wedding and while yes, it is expensive with venue and catering and the bells and whistles, the idea that a person is OBLIGATED to give gifts is the issue I have. OP mentioned their favorite gift having been some cheap thrift store wine glasses, which isn't offsetting any of the wedding cost. The only thing that offsets that wedding cost is cash. If the point is to put the newlyweds in a better financial start for the wedding, might as well just have a cheaper wedding and use the money saved for the couple themselves. Again, I might be the weird one here, but we went in assuming we were getting no financial backing for our wedding outside of ourselves and aren't asking for any gifts. Anything given by anybody is purely of their own will and nobody's going to get a cold shoulder for not subsidizing us.", "[deleted]", "That's fair. I'm just telling you what I've seen through the history of weddings. At our wedding it would have been unthinkable, from their perspective, that our families not give us money, they literally put money aside for family weddings. I've never gone to a wedding where I haven't offered at least the cost of the meal I ate.\n\nTo your point maybe we're the odd ones, but in our circles it's not acceptable to go to a wedding and not offer something. Even a set of wine glasses, which could have been free, could add to the inventory the couple didn't have before the wedding, and those glasses may now be more meaningful than a random, yet high priced set could . High price doesn't always make something useful, probably my fault for mentioning that it could be a financial headstart and not elaborating about how useful free things can be...I would argue that anything I got for free, regardless of its purchase price, still puts me ahead, especially if it's something that I would have bought if not gifted it", "Its okay she doesn\u2019t want to vacation with people who tend to leave it to them to pay. Plus could even make the effort of a card. Relationships are both sides. \n\nOp did not say excommunicated. She willing to still see them however doesn\u2019t want to be a spend a vacation with them. Especially with limited pto. \n\nShould op not get a voice on how she spends her pto?", "I gotcha. And like I said I might be the weird one here lol\n\nI've had a touchy history with a stigma about being given gifts feeling like handouts that I've had to work through, and in today's economic age it just feels selfish to EXPECT something from anybody when I'm just happy to have the loved ones think enough of me to show up. I totally get the history of it, but I've grown to think of things in terms of \"does it make sense to do things the same just because that's how it's always been?\"\n\nWe did get some money from my parents to help pay for the wedding, but it was entirely out of the blue and we were ready to pay ourselves 100%. If we could, we've even messed with the idea of just doing a sudden flash-mob wedding and saving all that money we would have spent for a nicer honeymoon."]}
