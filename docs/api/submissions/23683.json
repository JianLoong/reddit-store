If so, suck it up, you burned your gift budget. If not, they suck.", "NTA\n\nThey sound kind of moochy.", "A lot of couples get married fairly young. Marriages, even cheap ones, are expensive. Just the cost to feed family can be nuts.

OP mentioned their favorite gift having been some cheap thrift store wine glasses, which isn't offsetting any of the wedding cost. The only thing that offsets that wedding cost is cash. If the point is to put the newlyweds in a better financial start for the wedding, might as well just have a cheaper wedding and use the money saved for the couple themselves. Again, I might be the weird one here, but we went in assuming we were getting no financial backing for our wedding outside of ourselves and aren't asking for any gifts. Anything given by anybody is purely of their own will and nobody's going to get a cold shoulder for not subsidizing us.", "[deleted]", "That's fair. I'm just telling you what I've seen through the history of weddings. At our wedding it would have been unthinkable, from their perspective, that our families not give us money, they literally put money aside for family weddings. I've never gone to a wedding where I haven't offered at least the cost of the meal I ate.\n\nTo your point maybe we're the odd ones, but in our circles it's not acceptable to go to a wedding and not offer something. Even a set of wine glasses, which could have been free, could add to the inventory the couple didn't have before the wedding, and those glasses may now be more meaningful than a random, yet high priced set could . High price doesn't always make something useful, probably my fault for mentioning that it could be a financial headstart and not elaborating about how useful free things can be...I would argue that anything I got for free, regardless of its purchase price, still puts me ahead, especially if it's something that I would have bought if not gifted it", "Its okay she doesn\u2019t want to vacation with people who tend to leave it to them to pay. Plus could even make the effort of a card. Relationships are both sides. \n\nOp did not say excommunicated. She willing to still see them however doesn\u2019t want to be a spend a vacation with them. Especially with limited pto. \n\nShould op not get a voice on how she spends her pto?", "I gotcha. And like I said I might be the weird one here lol\n\nI've had a touchy history with a stigma about being given gifts feeling like handouts that I've had to work through, and in today's economic age it just feels selfish to EXPECT something from anybody when I'm just happy to have the loved ones think enough of me to show up. I totally get the history of it, but I've grown to think of things in terms of \"does it make sense to do things the same just because that's how it's always been?\"\n\nWe did get some money from my parents to help pay for the wedding, but it was entirely out of the blue and we were ready to pay ourselves 100%. If we could, we've even messed with the idea of just doing a sudden flash-mob wedding and saving all that money we would have spent for a nicer honeymoon.", "If it were *just* about the gift, as shitty as it is that they didn't even get you a card, I think Y-W-B-T-A, but it sounds like that's just the culmination of a pattern of behaviour with them and you just can't trust that they won't use you for money.\n\nNTA", "The thing about cruising is you REALLY need to like the people you go with.

This truthfully doesn't seem to be an issue over a wedding gift--which, yeah, could be construed as thoughtless, but not necessarily something worth throwing an otherwise good relationship into the trashcan. This seems to be about the fact that those family members expect to be given things with nothing given back in return, whether in appreciation or reciprocal actions. If it's a long-term pattern, then there's really no point in continuing a close relationship.", "NTA. But i thought some ppl say that you have up to one year after the wedding to send a gift?

Once onboard you can buy a alcohol or soda card that is for you only and again, something else that you can pre pay for upfront.  You can cruise around a ship cashless, tips are typically automatically paid.  They\u2019re trips and excursions that you can do on shore but you\u2019d only have to pay for you and him.\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the wedding gifts, not everyone can afford one.

We ended up keeping it small, trying to stay out of the spotlight more than keeping costs down, although we were in our mid 20s at the time so cost was a bit of an issue. \n\nI had also worked at the wedding hall we chose, so we saved on setup fees because I did it myself, we also got some pretty decent pricing on food and wine because the boss liked me, which kind of lends to your idea that the economy is just so shitty now it is a strange place to expect anything from anyone. Having been married for 10 years that's also why I feel like it's almost a responsibility to contribute something to a wedding, I've been in a young couple trying to figure it out, and I now have more means to contribute, although I always tried to give something when I was younger. \n\n I think it's also fair to mention here that if your wedding required an overnight stay with multiple paid meals, and I couldn't bring a gift, I would probably respectfully decline to attend and send my best wishes, hopefully attend a post marriage party back home...some of the destination weddings in the family/friend circle with limited guests lists chose that route.\n\n\n\nWe both seem to have our little oddities that influence our views on the subject, lol", "YTA\n\nYour husband has a much better attitude that will make him much happier in life.

Stewing and nursing your own resentment doesn't help anyone, least of all you.\n\nGo on the cruise with your husband and enjoy yourselves.

You don't have to be.  \n\nAlso, you don't really like or enjoy these people. A cruise with people you don't like sounds like hell, honestly.

He isn't seeing them using you two, he is just seeing you complain that they fidnt get you a gift for your wedding so you don't want to go on a cruise with them because of that. I would have a sit-down conversation with him explaining why you feel the way you do so he can understand and hopefully not see you as an ass like most of us don't. \nbest of luck!", "Nta\n\nYou don't owe his family your vacation time.\n\nAlso, you can be dirt poor but can at least write a nice card/letter for 2$ for a wedding.", "Forget the gift, if you dont like these people then its unfair to force you to spend your vacation with them. Esp. in such close quarters such as a cruise where you won't be able to avoid them for long. Sounds like your dislike stems from a long standing pattern of these people taking advantage of you and your husband with the wedding gift (or lack of it) being the straw that broke the camel's back. Attending the wedding without so much as a card was incredibly tacky of them but you shouldn't approach your husband with that issue. Just tell him that you don't want to spend your entire vacation with them. \n\nNTA.", "Yes. YTA.\n\nfor expecting a gift for your wedding. Your husband is right and you guys should be grateful they came .", "NTA\n\nSounds like there's a pattern of them using you. At the wedding they got the pre-wedding party and brunch, etc. \n\nYour husband's wrong. The etiquette is that if you go to the wedding, you are supposed to give a gift. And that gift is ***not*** your special presence at the blessed event.\n\nWhy does your husband want your vacation to be you being around people that you resent and don't want to spend time with? You're *married*. Your wants and desires are supposed to be more important to him than what his aunts and cousins want.\n\nIn a marriage, vacations are two yes, one no. You've stated your one no.", "the gift thing is a bit idk over the top on your thing, in which i agree with your husband. Although if you would be paying for the entire vacation that is a different story.", "You are also being over dramatic, it's a wedding gift, you'd probably lose it anyway.", "Agree. One single bad instance cannot be used as a pretext for going no contact/socializing unless, it has significant implications, but if it is systemic, then yes. Similar to the 3 strike rule in baseball.", "Maybe this is a cultural thing I am missing the nuance on: Where is the 'taking advantage'? They go weddings and give monetary gifts. This was a CHOICE. The money expended for those events, and even participating at all, are choices. Even under the pressure of societal expectation, it's still a choice at the end of the day. I would never expect the expenses associated with attending a wedding, even the destination wedding, to be footed by someone else, so I wouldnt see that as being taken advantage of. If OP is so worried about $$, send money but don't attend the wedding. A lot of people do that so they can focus their limited contribution ability on getting the couple off to a good financial start. So why is this being viewed as a negative pattern of behavior?", "> others feel that paying for the flights/hotel/expenses to attend IS their gift. \n\nAnd in the US, they would be wrong.", "...speak for yourself, others do cherish gifts. But that's besides the point - it is disrespectful to not even offer congratulations to the bride and groom who's wedding you are attending and OP mentions that she and her husband routinely end up paying for these people with no thanks or reciprocation.", "\"I image that we will get stuck paying for everything (as we have in the past) since there is just little care. I feel like they tend to often be selfish and use us for things\" - OP\n\nOP is NTA", "From my understanding it\u2019s not really about the gift or card. Op mentioned that every time they go out with her husband father they pretty much end up footing the bill.. I think do to that the least the could have done is get them a card expressing appreciation for how much the appreciation them\u2026 it seems to me that op have been noticing this for awhile but instead of sharing with husband op came on here to vent. \n\nApologize for the grammar and spell and whatever else is wrong in my post.", "The taking advantage is that they didn't give *any* gift. Monetary or otherwise.\n\nIn this culture, if you attend a wedding, you give a gift. Your presence doesn't count as the gift.\n\nAnd it sounds like they've used the couple to pay for other things in the past. I'm guessing meals and I don't know what else.", "Yeah if they are expecting OP to foot the bills...we got problems. My question is what is the dynamic now with hubby and family. Is the oldest and 'most successful' and this is a cultural more that he is comfortable with and OP isn't? They have to be on the same page about financial contributions to family or this is gonna be a lifetime of strife.", "Admittedly, I missed the part that they have paid in the past for things. That is a legit concern.", "Well I would understand if she said I don't do cruises, because neither do I especially after COVID and the titanic. Really seems like Reno on the high seas. However the gift thing is petty and a bad way to lead. If you do Cruise despite the risk of drowning and plague ship then the lack of gift alone is a poor reason to decline. Furthermore, if it's a \"I only have so many vacation days and I don't want to spend it with aunties\" also understandable."]}
