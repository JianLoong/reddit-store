Or anyone other than the family.", "No it\u2019s a pretty mainstream bible church, preacher is a good man. \n\nand I don\u2019t think it\u2019s personal, weirdly.", "They used the money to start a very capital intensive business (property rentals). So I would assume most of their success today is a direct result of inheriting money themselves.", "The vast majority of people who had to go through this would have appreciated the financial assistance from their grandparents and not be saddled with a crushing student debt. The fact that they're not thinking about the grandkids' future struggles doesn't paint them as loving grandparents. They could tie the money up in very strict trusts to make it harder to exploit, but just giving it all away to a church seems really insulting. I don't think op should have blown up at them, but their feelings are valid.", "Hard disagree here. \n\nWhile it's true that the vast majority of parents don't have the opportunity to pass wealth like this onto their kids, there's no escaping that *these* parents do.\n\nTheir refusal to do so--particularly with reasons of \"you don't need it\" and \"you don't deserve it\"--are a blatant statement that even when they're dead and literally cannot use the money, they'd prefer  to give it away rather than provide for their family. When they're dead. When they can't use the money. When there would be no additional effort on their part to provide for their family. Ever. \n\nMoney's always tricky, because it's hard to complain about being cut out of the will or whatever else without sounding like you're digging for gold. But often, like now, there's a statement being made, and that statement can hurt completely independently of the monetary value.", "You\u2019re right, they don\u2019t. But deciding what they did, after using inherited money to get richer, and then watching their grandkids take on debt to go to college (which they never had to do) seems hypocritical to me.", "He isn\u2019t obligated to have a relationship with them either.", "Yes, they used the money they got in the 1970\u2019s to start a property rental business which became very successful.", "All of that is a non-starter. Off the table. They\u2019re fully intending to donate small amounts to the same church until they die then the whole amount.", "They kind of are hypocritical. What exactly did they do to earn the money they got?", "Believe me, it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ve helped my dad do light work on his rentals for years because he\u2019s my dad and that\u2019s what you do. I did always assume I\u2019d get something, just like he got from his dad, but never zero.", "No, they aren\u2019t budging at all on giving any to family. They accredit their own successes to themselves entirely (despite inheriting money that was later used as seed capital to start their business). But they think everyone should make their own, without seeing the hypocrisy.", "Yeah not at all. I spent a significant amount of time working with my dad growing up on his rentals for basically free. Never asked him for anything post college. And I like my parents a lot. This is just uncharacteristic/ feels weird", "They used their inheritance as seed capital for a property rental business- they\u2019re not entirely self made. \n\nIt\u2019s not just money. It hurt hearing I don\u2019t get anything.", "Inheritance aside doesn\u2019t exist because they inherited alot of money.", "I understand, in an ideal world I\u2019d get the news and just nod and say \u201cyes dad I completely understand\u201d. And have no problem whatsoever. But it\u2019s easier said than done.", "I mean ultimately you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t like how they inherited a bunch themselves and then decided to do what they did arbitrarily.", "I mean yes, in an ideal world I\u2019d get the news and just nod and say \u201cyes dad I understand.", "No they\u2019re pretty sharp and \u201cwith it.\u201d Their decision seemed to be pretty deliberate.", "No there\u2019s no convincing them otherwise and I know that, they\u2019ve always been pretty resolute/stoic in decision making. But in that moment I definitely saw red", "In other comments OP has said that they inherited the money in the 70\u2019s and used the money to start a property rental business. So they used the money to make themselves wealthier.", "I'm from the city you're talking about but now living in another country, and I was just trying to explain the concept of the man and church you're referring to, to my (extremely religious) neighbor. I pulled up pictures of the church and of his house and she was appalled. And then when I told her about the hurricane and his inaction, especially in comparison to the furniture store guy, her mind was blown. Churches can be pretty terrible everywhere, but this cat is just reprehensible.", "And also will support all kinds of anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion causes.", "Well I\u2019m quite sorry to hear that. I don\u2019t know this seems like a really tough plight. I\u2019m one of those people who believes life is short and try to be on good terms with your parents if they raised you fairly BUT I am not sure I would react well if they had 10 million dollars and left me and my children with nothing, especially if quite a bit of that inheritance was from their parents anyways. Like they should at least pass that part along and trust you to make the right decision. This entire country is based on generational wealth passing between families, if someone makes the leap and gives it all away, they are sort of damning their families and taking them back to zero. I\u2019m really sorry man.", "In that case very mild NTA. Your reaction wasn\u2019t necessarily appropriate, but it\u2019s COMPLETELY normal to feel hurt and offended by their decision.", ">The vast majority of people who had to go through this would have appreciated the financial assistance from their grandparents and not be saddled with a crushing student debt.\n\nI graduated with 5k in student loan debt because I worked through college. It took me a little more time, but I got there.\n\nUnfortunately, most kids don't have the wherewithal to see what a giant trap college loan debt is", "You're right to be upset. Boomers are kinda brain damaged with all the lead they ingested.", "Why aren't you saving for your kids' education? Why is that your parents obligation and not yours? Surely you had an inkling when you decided to have kids that they might someday want to go to college. You could have started saving from the start.", "It's very hypocritical but YTA for how you responded. Calling them idiots and basically blowing up your relationship with them and their relationship with your kids.", "I didn't say he was. It's just my own personal opinion that money is a silly reason to end an otherwise good relationship. Apparently you and OP have different values than me.", "Do you have any siblings? If so, what do they say?\n\nIt is their money to do with how they see fit. However, they have to appreciate that they\u2019re ceasing the family  heritage and future in one grand action.  \n\nI\u2019d understand 10% going to charity/church, but the whole lot is very short sighted.\n\nHow have they reacted to your comments?\n\nNTA btw", "Oh, ok.  It sounded like they recently inherited that money but were already wealthy so I was having trouble seeing the hypocrisy in that situation.\n\nI'll go ESH then.  It's their money, but they are being hypocritical about you not earning it and providing not even a sliver of that amount to your children/their grandchildren.  However it was 50 years ago and their priorities and values can change.  Any chance that they have an unhealthy relationship with their church?", "Wow. I'll edit my response. That's stunningly awful of them. You are NTA.\n\n\"They'll know you are my disciples by how miserly you are toward your children.\"", "This sucks but you gotta drop these clowns. Imagine winning monopoly starting the game with hotels on every property and being greedy af. How could you feel any love or care for them after they give away everything to a false prophet because they think they can buy their way into heaven.", "Yeah the hypocrisy is real. And your disappointment is valid\n\nBut you are still not entitled to the money. \n\nBest to start planning your future knowing that the money isn't coming your way. Probably the best plan anyway since if you love your parents you want them to live a long time and they may not pass on until your kids have left college.", "Definitely NTA. Your parents are terrible, especially in light of this comment - bootstrapping Boomers who are also landlords?", "What if they had simply used up all their money in life? What if their business had failed? Would you be mad about that as well?", "Or if you were just a better person. You don't need the money, and yet you don't want it to go to charity. That's gross and I have no sympathy for you.", "Yeah but they didn\u2019t get a choice to inherit anything, right? It\u2019s not like they stood over their grandparents and demanded their money upon their death.", "I can understand your pain. Thing is, they could have been testing you. And you failed the test. I think a better angle at this point would have been, \"Hey Mom and Dad, I would love to be able to send Little Johnny to our college as a legacy, but I don't want to stick him with hundreds of thousands of student debt. Do you know of any grants or programs or do any of your friends know of any grants we can get so that he can attend this college that we all went to?\" That at least would have made it look like you were looking out for your kid. The only thing I can recommend now is to still treat them like your parents. Maybe this can blow over; maybe one of your other siblings can get through to them.\n\nThat said, community college doesn't suck. If they see you working with what you have, they may indeed come around as well.", "My point is, no matter what happens there\u2019s no need for name-calling. Just because they\u2019re standing firm doesn\u2019t mean you get to hurl abuse at them.", "Survivorship bias", "I have saved. I went to a private college where I met my wife, my dad and grandfather went there as well. I want to send my kids there but it\u2019s prohibitively expensive (80k a year). So they would have to take on significant debt.", "No I wouldn\u2019t be mad in that case.", "It\u2019s also not like they gave it to charity when it actually had any bearing on their own comfort", "No, but they did use some of the money to start their own business in their early 30\u2019s, which worked largely due to having large amounts of capital ready. But now they see it entirely as the value of their own hard work.", ">Survivorship bias\n\nSurvivorship bias states that we only remember the successes.\n\nThat's not relevant to *my own life story.*", "Maybe it's time to adjust your plans and plan for a less expensive college for your children. It might feel bad to break the family tradition but it seems like that tradition was funded by family money so if your parents are ending the tradition of handing that down you can end the tradition of sending your kids there. I'm sure the kids can get a decent education for less money.", "Were you planning to make sure your parents were dead before your kids went to college? Otherwise, your inheriting money won\u2019t help pay for the tuition.", "I\u2019m not sure what your comment means here. What, you think they shouldn\u2019t enjoy the windfall they got and make plans to donate it when they no longer need it? Are you suggesting they should just donate it now?\n\nTo me, this money is op\u2019s parent\u2019s money. They get to decide what to do with it entirely. If the choice is to donate (now, later, some combination) that should be their right. The person who doesn\u2019t have a right to the money is\u2026well, anyone but the parents.", "I feel like that\u2019s separate here. Like they can be AH for that, but for the question posed here of \u201cthey won\u2019t give me their money when they die\u201d is just entitled. I see in other comments you just assumed you\u2019d get their money when they die. \n\nI\u2019ve always found inheritance super morbid though. Like, I don\u2019t think counting someone else\u2019s money while their alive to try and figure out how much you get is a good, kind, or ethical thing. But that\u2019s me.", "\"I worked through college and didn't rack up crushing debt.\" \n\n*If I can do it, so can everyone else!*\n\nSurvivorship bias. Literally.", "Without a doubt. It\u2019s just unfortunate. A few of my other siblings managed to be much more materially successful than me and are able to afford sending their kids there, which also makes me feel shitty.", "I would feel more comfortable dipping into savings/retirement if I knew I\u2019d inherit some eventually.", "My impression is they\u2019re typical rich people who think of money as a moral test for everybody but themselves. Might be a reach but I have trouble believing they aren\u2019t assholes which probably explains why their progeny sucks, too", "Rich people can be AH, for sure. Not debating that one. My comment is that in this situation, it\u2019s within their rights to not give money to OP. It just screams entitled to me to demand something from someone else.", "My vote was ESH. It\u2019s either a stupid lesson they\u2019re trying to impart or a game they\u2019re playing (fishing for a bad response) but, yeah, OP\u2019s probably a jackass in any case"]}
