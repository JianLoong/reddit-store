Super tacky!", "NTA. In my understanding you don't pay for the food when you have been invited. You could have agreed to have some sort of potluck, where one person took it on herself to do all the cooking and the other participants gave some money instead bringing their own dishes, but that would need a discussion. It is ridiculous that a little baby should pay for a buffet that they probably can't even sample. Of course you can't force anyone to take part in an arrangement like that.

I'm the oldest of six kids, not to mention the bonus kids that my brothers bring home.

I think sister should have said at the jump, \"hey would y'all be alright pitching on for food? I'll cook it!\" (which honestly is in and of itself worth the $10 a head) Charging for the 11 month old is egregiously greedy. \n\nIt could have been a situation where sister didn't realize how expensive it would be to feed that many people, which I have also done before.
