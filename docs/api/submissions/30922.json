I then had a weekend brunch with my friends, they wanted to know all about it and started asking me about my wedding plans. A lot of them are married so they were also giving me advice on a few things. It was all going well, but then my friend Alicia (F33) noticed my necklace and asked me about it. My fiance also gave me a necklace with my future initials on it when he proposed (my first name and his last name), we've discussed it in the past and I love the idea of sharing his last name. \n\nThe moment I told her that it was a gift from him, Alicia started berating my fiance for upholding outdated cultural beliefs and how he must be very controlling and possessive. I explained that I want to take his last name after marriage, and she still continued. She told me that this necklace is like a dog collar, that he's trying to claim that I'm his property and I should feel insulted over such a misogynistic present. \n\nAt this point, I lost it and said, \" Well, you should be glad because nobody will ever claim you in such a patriarchal fashion\". She started crying and left. My friends agreed with me that she was being extremely insulting but a few of them later said that I should still apologize because marriage is a sore spot for Alicia as she's the eldest in the group and unmarried (nobody has ever shamed her for it, but she has cried at a few friends' weddings). \n\nSo, Am I the asshole for indirectly saying that nobody will marry her?\n\n(PS- English isn't my first language, so if I've made a grammatical error, please ignore it.)", "created_utc": 1699893861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ues3l/aita_for_indirectly_telling_my_friend_that_nobody/", "score": 729, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was rude and you were unnecessarily cruel to her. You both suck.", " Do you two even like each other? ESH", "ESH.  There's nothing wrong with Alicia's viewpoint, but as she's trying to force it upon you, she's an AH.  You making the comment about how no one will want her makes you an AH.  You could've just said, \"Alicia, I'm happy with my decision.  Drop it\".", "Info: Is Alicia always pushing her opinion on people? Is she usually bordering on bully?", "ESH. She was definitely out of line for going off on that, especially once it was confirmed that it was your choice and something you wanted. It is an AH move for you to counter attack with a known sore spot tho.", "NTA - so she thinks you\u2019re holding outdated patriarchal beliefs but then wants to be married so much she cries at weddings?! She needs to sort herself out!", "NTA . Your friend was beyond insulting when comparing a necklace your necklace to a  dog collar . I don\u2019t care how \u201c feminist\u201d she claims to be it was beyond disgusting and whatever you say in return is justified . There is a time and place to be emphatic and just roll with others behaviour in this instance your response to her was well deserved", "NTA. She was acting as a bad friend trying to bring you down for choosing to do something that you willingly and happily entered into. If she'd taken you aside and talked about her concerns, however unfounded, that would be one thing. But making a scene in the friend group and then keeping at it when you made it clear this was your choice? I think what you said was perfectly valid. It's not like you attacked her as a person - you attacked the negative, hurtful things she insisted on saying. \n\nIf she feels ashamed/uncomfortable/whatever about your wedding, she needs to talk to you like an adult without trying to guilt/shame you. She also genuinely needs to go to a therapist and address the underlying insecurity she feels about being \"the single one\". I get it - I'm that person in my group and it hurts sometimes. but that's feelings I need to work through, not compare myself to others and not try to make other people unhappy because they have something I want.\n\nIf she is a valuable friend to you aside from this incident, maybe try to set aside time occasionally to do things together that don't involve the wedding. it might be a good break for you anyway, planning is such an all-consuming affair that many people lose themselves in it. you could also take her aside and tell her that while you sympathize with her feeling isolated, you are here for her - as long as she doesn't start being negative about the wedding again. that's a hard no.\n\n \nhowever, I would take a close look at whether she has a habit of putting others down and reevaluate the friendship if that is the case. one incident is certainly forgivable but only if she recognizes that her jealousy does not justify lashing out.", "NTA.... You tried to tell her it was all good, she continued.  I am so tired of people boundary stomping and then when someone stands up for themselves they are in the wrong.", "NTA, at all. If she's gonna offer up her opinion about YOUR marriage and relationship, then she's opening herself up to criticism about the subject. She doesn't get to just shut all over people's parade and then expect nobody to say anything back. Can't handle the heat, don't shit it out.", "NTA. The \u201cfriend\u201d wanted to insult you and your fianc\u00e9e and I don\u2019t see a problem with you standing your ground and defending yourself. Misery loves company. You should stop being her friend.", "NTA,\n\nMaybe it was a little intense but she needed to be put in check. She was disrespecting you and your fiance because she was jealous and envious.\n\nI don't even now why yall keep her has a friend. She was a big hater.\n\nMaybe if she was trying to work on herself and stop with her bullshit believes someone would want to be with her.\n\nShe is the one who should apologies.", "NTA \n\nAlicia sounds like she stews in her own self hatred and misery and is lashing out at you like an injured animal\n\nIf you want to continue with her, she has to be willing to apologise and recognise what and why what she said was wrong. Only then should you BOTH apologise to each other\n\nIf she refuses to apologise, kick the miserable freak to the road and be free from her", "She\u2019s just unhappy with life because she doesn\u2019t have a traditional one and her chance to is dwindling. Unfortunately for her a lot of people that have the same issue form groups and end up attacking traditions out of bitterness and try to convince themselves it\u2019s a bad life and they\u2019re lucky to have escaped it, when in reality the happiest you can be is with a family", "NTA. She can dish it out, but can't take it.\n\nLikes to push her strong opinions where they clearly aren't wanted, isn't reading the room, then cries victim when somebody stands up to her. She can fuck off.", "I am going with NTA\n\nJust because Alicia has progressive views doesn't mean she needs to belittle people who don't. The OP explained she was perfectly fine taking her husband's last name, as is MOST OF THE WESTERN CULTURE'S. At that point, Alicia should have SHUT HER MOUTH. It's NOT HER BUSINESS. Period. End of story. What's that saying, \"Not your monkey, not your circus\"? Just be Elsa, let it go. But, Alicia doubles down and goes on with the fact that the necklace is like a dog collar. \n\nHere is a woman who was enjoying her newfound status and someone was pissing all over her Wheaties. Yeah, I would have lost it too. There is a time and place, and it sounds like Alicia is a bitter individual is wants everyone else to be bitter too, so why not just piss everyone off. However, personally, if you are going to dish it out, you had better learn to take it. Alicia started it, but couldn't handle it when OP came back at her. \n\nNext time, if you can't handle it, sit down and keep your mouth shut.", "NTA - she was being a shitty friend. She was disrespectful to you and your fianc\u00e9. Good for you for sending it back to her. She sounds like she hates men, so being single shouldn\u2019t even be an issue for her.", "NTA, Alicia should have shut her mouth about the necklace and kept her views to herself, you were happy about your engagement and wanted to celebrate with folks you thought were your friends, she ruined that for you, you do not owe her any apology.", "NTA but its a shame it had to come to this\n\nIf shes the type of friend that speaks to you that way and you then speak to her in return like that then you are not friends, shes somebody you are scornful of in your friend group for the way she acts towards you.\n\nShes got no right to hector people over their choices and may really need to hear that the way she acts makes it hard for you to like her, let alone anyone else to be attracted to her.", "NTA that's hilarious. Someone needed to tell her she's the fuckin problem.", "ESH. What a toxic situation.", "ESH\n\nWhat she did was disgraceful and is blatantly backed by her fear that nobody wants her and her jealousy that you're getting married, what you did is not only bad but you also basically threw her worst fears in her face by saying she'd never get married.\n\nBoth of you were seriously in the wrong and you both need to apologise to each other.", "NTA(or justified ah)\n\nUsing a tennis analogy, if you are going to SERVE IT, you need to be prepared for it to be LOBBED back.\n\nHER COMMENTS put her in the GROSS and NOT FRIEND category and for REDDIT Purposes--she is the AH.  \n\nShe doesn't get to judge your relationship choices unless she wants hers to be judged.\n\nBesides, why should she be offended by your words--IF she really believed her \"Stance\" she should be GLAD that no man will ever \"claim\" her.(so she's a full on hypocrite too, because if some guy claimed her it is clear she'd be delighted by it)", "ESH. \"Indirectly\" my ass. She wasn't right to say what she did and you went NUCLEAR with the response. In the long run your words are the ones that are gonna linger the most.", "I was on your side until you said this completly heartless thing to her. \n\nESH. \n\nShe was an asshole for being so insistent about the subject and for pushing it over the line. \n\nHowever your response was, too, over the line, it was cruel. You could had said: well, good for you, you will not be the one using the neckless or change your name. And now stop talking about it, as I didnt ask your opinion. \n\nBut you loose it and choose to be very insensitive to her.", "I'm going NTA. She snapped at you for no God damn reason and got upset because you snapped back. You were right to.", "NTA, you explained it and she continued after you said you wanted to take his last name.", "NTA. There\u2019s a LOT wrong with Alicia\u2019s viewpoint and those saying there\u2019s nothing wrong with it are just trying to tip toe around her.\n\nThere is NOTHING wrong with you taking a man\u2019s last name and it doesn\u2019t propagate patriarchy that she\u2019s concerned about. The patriarchy part comes from the fact that women didn\u2019t have a choice except to take a man\u2019s last name. You and your husband clearly talked about it and mutually decided you wanted to take his name, good for you guys. This is the definition of an equal and healthy relationship. Ignore these fake feminists.\n\nOnce you said that to her, she needed to shut up but she decided to keep pushing and berating you out of jealousy. Anything out of your mouth after the fact was justified; she fked around and found out.\n\nBut I agree with others that you two don\u2019t seem to be friends, I suggest reevaluating your relationship with her.", "NTA she felt bold enough to say such nasty things to you so she should be fine getting it back. I think you should rethink a friendship with someone like this especially ahead of going into a new marriage. I wouldn't want to share my business with someone so toxic. Also, everyone that's including you as being an A H still knows she will be single forever as well.", "NTA.  She shouldn\u2019t have said anything.  I don\u2019t feel the least bit bad for her.  She crossed a line with her comments.  \n\nI\u2019m tired of people feeling like we need to coddle assholes.  She got what she deserved.", "NTA, it\u2019s your choice and only YOURS if you want to take your husbands name. She needs to keep her irrelevant opinions to herself, no wonder she\u2019s single. She\u2019ll never find a man who will love and respect her with that attitude.", "Nta. I'm sick of people saying you're a bad person for sticking up for your partner. She probably won't have anyone to love her if she keeps acting like a modern misandrist.", "Nta, she had it coming", "NTA , you\u2019re great", "NTA. I get what you said may have been harsh but she basically said you were his pet.", "NTA Don't want shit, don't talk shit. You made it clear and she shouldn't have pushed the point. Absolutely fucking brutal tho.", "Absolutely NTA. How did she expect to crap on your fianc\u00e9, the meaningful gift he gave you and your future relationship\u2019s meaning and then expect for you to be nice. \nNah. She was looking for it and she really found it. That\u2019s not a friend you got there. Cut her off.", "ESH. Sometimes it takes a while to realise you're used to someone's company but that doesn't make them your friend. You don't speak to each other like friends. She was disrespectful and so were you.

She was way over the line, but so were you. You do not sound like good friends to each other.", "big ESH. Telling her to shut up would be justified, but you told her she was going to die alone. Way over the line.", "NTA. She was trying to make you feel bad because she was jealous, pure and simple. Screw that. You don't need people around who just want to poke holes in your happiness.", "ESH.\n\nShe is obviously wrong for being jealous and projecting her anger at you and not at herself or life in general. Not sure why you are friends with someone so petty.\n\nBut you are also a jerk for hitting her exactly where it hurts. You could have taken the high road by simply telling her that she was being mean and could leave the lunch if she couldn\u2019t speak in a mature manner.", "ESH, and it's time to end your \"friendship\" with Alicia, because you're not friends at all. She should not have verbally attacked your fianc\u00e9 over a gift, that is not the sign of a healthy friendship or of someone with a healthy view on relationships. Her views are just as toxic as any misogyny could be. If you'd have taken your fianc\u00e9 and left, I'd have said NTA.   \n\n\nWhile Alicia may have deserved a retort, you knew very well that you were trying to hurt her as much as possible by telling her she'll be alone forever, especially since you mentioned that it's seemingly common knowledge in your friend group that she is sensitive about it. What you did was childish and petty. It's time to grow up and move on, this isn't high school anymore. Alicia needs therapy for her issues, meanwhile you need to learn how to be the bigger person in situations like that.", "NTA. Holy fuck what are these responses? Alicia compared OP to a dog and accused her fianc\u00e9 of being misogynystic because of a necklace. She insulted her and got insulted back. Jesus Christ people.

We can all see why Alicia is single.", "I believe in clap backs. It was an eye for an eye. NTA", "Nta. You said you were fine taking his name and she continued. But it doesn't sound like she's a good friend. A good friend would have stopped after you said you wanted his name, or never would have started. \n\nAnyone saying you went too far are wrong. People like that need a heavy hand or they never learn. As for apologising if you genuinely feel bad then by all means do so", "Love the echo chamber of Reddit. People are incapable of original thought on this app. \n\nNTA. She had no business talking to you that way and sometimes people need to be checked. You did just fine.", "I cracked up at your comment. NTA.", "ESH, especially you. She was rude, sure, but if there was no truth to what she was saying, and you knew marriage was a painful topic for her - how hard would it have been for you to be the bigger person? You hit her where it hurts.", "NTA b/c justified. (Though I was pretty close to everyone sucks)\n\nShe really shouldn't have shit all over your partner, the idea behind the gift, and your future marriage.\n\nBut you hit her where it hurts in order to hurt, in a soft spot. That's below the belt. However, it was a remark on roughly the same subject and it did its job in ending the situation. She was crapping all over the future marriage, and your retort was basically *at least I am getting married*. It wasn't a situation where you got mad at her and went after something completely unrelated.", "ESH. Your friend could have had the god damn patriarchy discussion in a completely different way, a vastly more respectful way; and you were just mean. If it weren't a sore spot for her, I can see how she might have responded, \"You're damn right nobody will ever claim me in a patriarchal fashion, when I fall in love it will be as equals!\" But you two seem to already have some friction between you. If you want to move forward with a healthy friendship, consider taking some time to talk it out just the two of you. Actually listen to her, and sincerely ask that she do the same for you. I hope you two can become better friends from this, but it won't magically happen - you'll need to put in the work. Good luck, and congratulations!", "Your friend will be eaten by her cats.\n\nAt least she gets to feel empowered though, eh?", "I just love hearing stories about the Patriarchy and misogyny, it all just sounds so magical and complicated.  Hearing tales of far off lands and times long ago is always interesting.", "\u201cWell, you should be glad because nobody will ever claim you in such a patriarchal fashion\u201d\n\nNTA. I think if you had said she\u2019d die alone or would never get married, it would\u2019ve been esh, but you didn\u2019t. You reflected her unsolicited viewpoints back to her and if she truly believed what she was saying, she would have agreed AND she wouldn\u2019t have been too upset over it. But she\u2019s clearly a hypocrite. She clearly cares and wants to be \u201cclaimed\u201d to some degree\u2026\n\nWas it a bit mean? Yeah, probably. But I would say it was very much called for. No one should tout views they aren\u2019t willing to own up to, especially if they\u2019re going to wield them to criticize others\u2019 decisions.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think you two are as much friends as obligatory acquaintances. And if your behavior made you unhappy, I would personally have a hard \u201cdiscuss the relationship\u201d with her and either end the friendship altogether or set hard boundaries for future discussions regarding such topics.", "it has to be done.", "ESH, but your comment about no one loving her is gross, especiallyif she was tour friend. I'm surprised you've found someone to love you with that attitude.", "NTA.  You simply returned her negative energy back and she couldn't handle it.  You're both adults.", "NTA. She sounds pretty much insufferable. If she can't respect you enough to keep her comments to herself, she can't protest when you strike back with it. It's not your fault that she felt the need to shove her far-too-critical viewpoint down your throat. If you didn't bring her a peg or two down, the world would have eventually done it for you.", "ESH\n\nAlicia was trying to force her viewpoint on you which is not okay and it sounds like she wildly misinterpreted the intent behin that gift, which is hardly her business to know or talk about to begin with.\n\nWhat you said in response was uncalled for and just mean though. You weren\u2019t wrong to call her out or shut it down, but you went right for the jugular by responding with a personal attack about an insecurity of hers that you are well aware of. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s better it you two aren\u2019t friends, neither of you sound like you have any respect for each other as it is.\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar", "NTA.\nYour friend personally attacked you and your future husband entire relationship.\nYou merely provided a factual statement as to why nobody can tolerate her in a relationship.", "This is clearly bait lol", "NTA.\n\nYou got annoyed after Alicia made several very insulting & overbearing comments about your necklace, fiance and future plans. \n\nYou were right, if she continue to retain that very noisy and obnoxious attitude nobody in their right mind will ever want to marry her or be her friend.", "I'm saying NTA.  I understand the E S H that many are stating.   Perhaps you did go too far, in your ... retaliatory strike.  However my opinion is that it is one thing to warn someone \"hey I think you are making a mistake\" vs \"I'm am going to attempt to stomp on your joy by holding onto a current buzzpoint like a terrier and not let it go\".   \n\nas an aside - I get the non-taking-husbands-name crowd.  It honestly does seem like a rather antiquated custom that basically seems like a pain in the ass for the name changee.  LAst names as a whole are kinda odd tho, When couples  don't share a last name, there can also be some issues if/when kids come into the picture.  Basically the whole 'last name' concept is facing some interesting times ahead. \n\nThat all said, man, Alicia just was waaaay over the top.  I mean you are being so happy and she seemed hell bent on making sure you weren't.  Well,  she fucked around and found out.   Also, if she really had misgivings, in that she truly thought this guy was really a bad person and was trying to have a real heart to heart  a) this should have been brought up a while ago,  and b) it is also definitely a pull-aside-lets-talk-later sort of thing, i.e. one does not make this a free for all crowd event (which further implies to me that she wanted to cause a lot of public drama).  \n\nI'm sorry  Alicia is in your crew,  tho I'm guessing not for long.", "ESH. Neither of you sound particularly pleasant. You're worse though; you intentionally tried to hurt her.", "NTA. She is entitled to her own opinion like anybody else, but as soon as you expressed that you are fine with it and was something that you wanted and she kept steamrolling over you, well that becomes something different. That becomes someone trying to shove their beliefs down your throat which is a huge problem in the world today, if not the biggest problem. \n\nActions, meet consequences. I think we as a society should actually be calling this behavior out more, instead of tiptoeing around it.", "ESH lol either you're naturally a bit mean or you've been wanting to say that for a while", "She can get fucked. Im sure she has her reasons and im not putting that down but she is extremely offensive and toxic. Sometimes you just should'nt waste time on somebody undeserving, especially if they started it with the intention of hurting you.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have tried to shit on your engagement", "ESH honestly. \n\nWhat you said wasn\u2019t right at all, I would never say that to a friend even if I was mad at her. \n\nWhat she did was uncalled for tho, and it seems like it was all coming from jealousy. \n\nI also have *never* felt like wearing anything with my husband\u2019s initial (or similar) is like wearing a **\u201ddog collar\u201d**. In fact, I\u2019ve bought many cute necklaces with his initials on them, because I\u2019m happy and proud to be his wife and the necklaces just make me feel more connected lol\n\nShe\u2019s weird for trying to make your fianc\u00e9 out to be controlling just because he bought you a cute necklace with your future initials on them. I would have died of happiness if my husband did that when he proposed.", "ESH", "Reading your replies it sounds like she's honestly jealous and bitter. She could've easily kept her opinion to herself or if she was genuinely concerned could've brought this topic up way nicer. Like \"is you taking his name something that you want to do? Are you happy with that necklace?\" And not do what she did. It sounds like this is kinda the straw that broke the camels back. Best advice, don't be friends with her. She will always be jealous and bitter. And even if she finds love, sometimes people like that will act like their relationship is better then everyone else's too. Not saying thats how she would act but I've seen it happen personally. So yeah, NTA", "ESH. You love the gift and decided to take your husband\u2019s name. Your decision. Alicia shouldn\u2019t have berated you for it. Coming back with a low low was unnecessary. Are you too really friends?", "Yes.", "Esh\n\nY\u2019all do not speak to eachother like friends. Her point was poorly made and not appropriate since you clearly were happy with the gift, but your response was aggressive as well", "NTA - as long as you want to take the last name then fine but if not she is correct.", "ESH. She shouldn't have said the things she said, but neither should you.", "ESH lol why are you friends", "Nta ignore all the feminists in the comments saying everyone sucks it\u2019s probably why your friend doesn\u2019t have a SO", "NTA. While your comment back was a little below the belt and I don\u2019t think you guys could continue a friendship if there isn\u2019t mutual apologies, your friend sounds a tad attention seeking. Crying at other people\u2019s weddings about their own relationship status seems inappropriate and pity party-esque.", "Don't worry OP! You two aren't actually friends! So what we have here is a toxic blow-up. You fought inappropriate fire with inappropriate fire. Were you an AH? Yes. Was she? Yes. Perhaps this is a sore spot for me because I am an Old Maid but ugh your remark was harsh as hell. However, man she is what gives feminists a bad name and a cringe factor. Cut your losses because this isn't actually a loss. People who bring out the worst in you shouldn't be around you, and this is the worst in you. ESH", "I'm a big feminist myself and agree that it's extremely outdated to HAVE TO take your husbands name or to be expected to do so without ever talking about it. I think it would've been weird if your husband gave you the necklace without talking about it beforehand, but you did. There's nothing wrong or misogynistic going on here. Your comment was also AH-material though. ESH but your friend is worse imo.", "ESH. Alicia has a valid point of view, but things with misogynistic roots can have meaning in healthy relationships today. But you also took it too far in your response. I think you both would do well to talk out some issues.", "ESH- you\u2019re both dicks to each other", "I support women who change their names. I support women who don\u2019t change their names. It\u2019s a personal choice. \n\nI\u2019m going to go with ESH because instead of talking to each other like friends who have empathy and kindness for each other you both lashed out with hurt and frustration. Congratulations and good luck.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think she should\u2019ve taken the idea of the beautiful necklace and turned it into a personal attack against your partner, the necklace wasn\u2019t anything made in a negative manner towards you. It wasn\u2019t her place to be so rude and childish and blame her being single on you. \n\nHowever I DO think had the right to call her out and hit her where it hurts, your fianc\u00e9 simply loves you and wants to share his name with you, not own and control you. \n\nI hope your friend apologizes to you both and owns up to her behavior.", "NTA", "why would she be butthurt when she very obviously doesnt like the patriarchal idea of marriage anyway lmaoooo nta at all", "Honestly, I\u2019d say you\u2019re both the asshole. She had no right to say any of those things, and going on a tirade to defend your honour when you actively don\u2019t want her to do is a pretty asshole move. However, I would say that your knee jerk reaction (while entirely understandable and maybe even justified) was also pretty rude and hurtful.", "It was justified, so NTA", "YTA for saying that because it was extremely unkind.  She was also AH for saying what she said to you.  She can have an opinion and voice it when it comes to taking his name - but that's all.  Having a civil discussion with pros and cons is one thing, but she was WAY out of line with the 'dog collar' and 'his property'.  \n\nI understand your anger but you lashed out and that's not right.

I then had a weekend brunch with my friends, they wanted to know all about it and started asking me about my wedding plans. A lot of them are married so they were also giving me advice on a few things. It was all going well, but then my friend Alicia (F33) noticed my necklace and asked me about it. My fiance also gave me a necklace with my future initials on it when he proposed (my first name and his last name), we've discussed it in the past and I love the idea of sharing his last name. \n\nThe moment I told her that it was a gift from him, Alicia started berating my fiance for upholding outdated cultural beliefs and how he must be very controlling and possessive. I explained that I want to take his last name after marriage, and she still continued. She told me that this necklace is like a dog collar, that he's trying to claim that I'm his property and I should feel insulted over such a misogynistic present. \n\nAt this point, I lost it and said, \" Well, you should be glad because nobody will ever claim you in such a patriarchal fashion\". She started crying and left. My friends agreed with me that she was being extremely insulting but a few of them later said that I should still apologize because marriage is a sore spot for Alicia as she's the eldest in the group and unmarried (nobody has ever shamed her for it, but she has cried at a few friends' weddings). \n\nSo, Am I the asshole for indirectly saying that nobody will marry her?\n\n(PS- English isn't my first language, so if I've made a grammatical error, please ignore it.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
