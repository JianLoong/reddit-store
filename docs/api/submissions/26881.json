You know, Grandma Sally on the one hand and Grandma Jane on the other? Has this never occurred to you?", "INFO: Are you also reliably calling your own mother \"Grandma Smith\"? \n\nBecause that would at least be fair. Often, because at least where I live mothers are likely to do more of the work of raising kids, maternal grandparents get to have closer relationships with the kids than paternal grandparents, and in your case proximity also means your MIL has less chance to be with them. So yeah, I can see why it would be upsetting to her if it was Grandma and Grandma Jones. I'm not sure if that would make you the AH, but I can definitely see an argument for trying to find ways to not suggest to her that she's the \"lesser\" grandma.\n\nYou can also work around it, as in \"Your grandma from Virginia will be visiting this weekend.\" \"Grandma is going to FaceTime with you after dinner. Maybe she will tell you fun stories about when Daddy was little.\" It will take a bit for your kids to catch these cues, but long term it might be worthGrandma.\n\nGood luck: I had a Granny and a Grandmother, and that was far easier.", "NTA\n\nThis is what we did in my family (but with first names instead of last names).\n\nWe had a Granny Cathy, a Granny Irene, and a Grandma Dorothy, and a Grandpa Pat, Grandpa Fred, and Grandpa Harry.  \n\nWhen we were talking to our grandparents or with them, we called them granny/grandma or grandpa, because it was obvious in context who we meant.  But if we were talking about our grandparents, we always used \u201ctitle-first name\u201d.  Even for the one grandmother who was the only one that was \u201cgrandma\u201d and not \u201cgranny\u201d.\n\nYou can ask your in laws if they prefer that, to be called grandma-first name / grandpa-first name.  But they can\u2019t just be grandma and grandpa when you\u2019re talking about them at your house, because they aren\u2019t the only grandma and grandpa!  They have to accept that.", "NTA.

Apparently I loved one ofmy mom's friend's spaghetti. So my mom began to call her \"Auntie Spaghetti.\" It stuck only because nobody cared.  Even Auntie Spaghetti.", "NTA\n\nA grandparent name is ultimately only a *suggestion*.  It is not binding and cannot be binding because the grandkids will have a very large say in what they call their grandparents, and they will not make that known until several years in.  \n\nYour kids have two figures who go by Grandma.  They need a way to differentiate the two.  Your MIL can either suggest a way that works for her like \"Grandma J\" or \"Gee J\", or she can accept whatever ends up working for your kids.

I'm even going as far as she seems like an AH.\n\nOP, you seem like a very reasonable mother, good luck with this person, your children will be ok, maybe for now just say Grandma in VA and Grandma in FL.\n\nMy own mother wanted to be called Grandmommy, and my sister's kids still call her grandma, and she still loves them as much as my kids that call her grandmommy, even though my kids are adults now, my grandkids call her grandmommy and my sister's grandkids call her grandma, my sister is a Mimi.

You don't have to call the grandmas Grandma Jones and Grandma Smith to their faces.  When the kids are at each home, they can call each grandma just that - grandma.  But it makes sense to have a clarifying name to use when you are in your home, talking about one of the grandmas, and last name is certainly reasonable.\n\nOf course, you could do what we did - the \"nice\" grandma was who we called Grandma, and we called the other grandma \"Grandma Lastname\" when we talked about them.  Us kids ALL knew who was meant when we just said Grandma.", "Had a similar issue with our parents. We had Nanna xyz and Nanna Abc. Mum hates her name always has, so Nanna Abc didn't work for her.

As long as it starts with \u201cGrandma,\u201d you are meeting her request. Tell her that there *must* be something else to distinguish her from the other Grandma, and she can tell you what she wants it to be. First name, last name, whatever. But your kids have two Grandmas and they need a way to tell them apart.", "I think I would tell her that she is going to have to deal with it as the kids have other grandparents.", "I can see where she's coming from. It sounds really formal and stiff, so she must feel as if it will be harder to connect with the kids. I wouldn't want to be called grandma last name, I would want to be just gran or just grandma. \n\nSit down with her and explain why you do it and let's find another name you like. \n\nOtherwise drop the Jones, and just daddy's mom and my mom.", "Both sides went with the same names in my family, so what we did is just said Grandma/Grandpa then whichever kid wanted to know asked which one and the answer was always Mom's or Dad's. That way no one got upset.", "Soon she might be referred to as crazy grandma\u2026.. That\u2019s what I called my one but never in front of her or my dad.", "Can you just say grandma and if the kiddos ask, say Daddy\u2019s mom, or Mommy\u2019s mom?", "Then she can suck it up. The kids have multiple grandparents", "Yeah. In that case NTA. I still get why it might be touchy for your MIL, but you aren't treating her worse than your mom.", "My MIL absolutely refused to be any form of Grandmother. When her oldest grandchild was born she said she was too young to be a grandma.\n\nSo she decided on Grandfirstname. So GrandJill or GrandJane. It was unique to her and even her children and kids in law called her that for the rest of her life.", "That really seems to be the workable compromise to me. Except for rare occasions when they are all in the same place, there won\u2019t be confusion when you are all together. But when you\u2019re telling them where you were going to go, outside their presents, in your own home for clarification call them whatever the hell you want.", "If that's the case, leave it alone and pretend that you are following her wishes. She doesn't need to know you call her Grandma Jones outside her presence.", "This makes you firmly NTA.  She should be careful what she asks for...if you don't help kid differentiate, they will come up with their own way.   My brother dubbed my grandmother's little Grammy and big Grammy.", "You say last name for both of them or just the Jones\u2019s?", "Yup. She is allowed to be upset. Neither is an asshole.", "Then why do you tell her", "That was my thinking.  \u201cGrandma and grandpa smith\u201d sounds really stiff and formal.  Grandma sally and grandma Jane sound more like a child\u2019s actual grandmas that they spend time with and have a relationship with.", "> Grandma Jones strikes me as impersonal. Everyone is different, but I think the first name addition would go over much better\n\nI think it's cultural/depends on the family. My Grandma was always Grandma Lastname to me, and I know my dad's Grandma was Grandma Lastname to him too. But my mom's mom was Grandma Firstname. My dad is from a different English-speaking country than my mom, though, and I got the feeling it was quite common for grandparents over there to be referred to by their last name.", "Yeah. It\u2019s way too formal and feels way too formal to say. All of my kids grandparents go by grandma and grandpa, and we use first names to clarify. The last names are harder to pronounce and I don\u2019t think any of their grandparents would feel okay being referred to by last name as opposed to first name.", "I had a great-grandmother who we all called \u201cMama [grandmother\u2019s maiden name],\u201d but it kind of worked because that particular last name is also used frequently as a first name. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It can *sometimes* work, but I\u2019ve mostly seen people incorporate first names instead of last names in their grandparent names if they do.", "My family did \u201cgrandma and grandpa (surname)\u201d and I also found it weird and impersonal. I never understood why we didn\u2019t just use first names instead, although now I believe it was based on some outdated idea that it\u2019s disrespectful for youth to use any adults first name.", "Absolutely,  I would prefer Grandma  Susan over Grandma  Jones.", "Oh my husband's stepmom is like that. She makes all her grandkids refer to her a G. Apparently when she found out her daughter was pregnant with the first grandchild, she lost her mind insisting she was too young to be a grandmother and actually got angry at her daughter. She was in her early 50s at the time.", "She has overheard it from time to time. Like when my kids ask who is on the phone", "That\u2019s fair and worth asking my MIL about considering. Personally I would never have dreamed of calling my grandparents by their first name as it would have felt improper. But if MIL is comfortable with that I don\u2019t care what my kids use!", "My grandparents were all grandma/grandad, so we called them b\nGrandma/grandad Jones/Smith when referring to them, but grandma/grandad when with them. Didn't make the relationship more formal, just a way to tell which one you're talking about.", "I think it depends on family traditions/where you grew up. I was always very close to my grandparents, and we called all of them Grandma and Grandpa Lastname or maybe just Grandma L and Grandma N. It never occurred to me that it sounded formal since that's just how we were raised and also how my parents and grandparents were raised. The majority of my friends growing up also did the same thing. I'm sure it's different in other places, but it's still extremely common in my state.\n\nETA: I grew up in a western state where my dad's family is from. My mom's family is from the midwest and they had the same naming conventions so maybe it's not a regional thing per se.", "Which is funny.

If we were talking about them we would add the last name to signify which one.  That was really common where I grew up.", "Us too.

Don't make assumptions.", "I grew up with grandma/grandpa lastname. But, I'm old.", "I think it's an older tradition and mostly to do with showing respect to your elders. My family was not strict at all about most things, but I would've never even considered calling any grandparent by their first name.

I don't understand why my mother was so bothered lol. My mom is stubborn, but she got over it because no one gave in.", "Do you want to stir the pot?  Call Grandma by her husband's name.

She preferred that to me calling her \"grandma first name\" and I know because at 15, I asked her if it ever bothered her. She didn't like anyone using her first name that wasn't a close friend or her late spouse, so she liked my use of our shared last name instead.", "NTA.
