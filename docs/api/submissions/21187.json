They\u2019ve continuously overstepped their boundaries since we had our son, 8 months ago.  Me (23f) and my husband (32m) went to an event this weekend where both of our families were there.  My husbands grandmother, who was just at our house for a visit two days prior, came over to me and took my baby without asking and she took off with him.  I saw her taking him to every person at the event.  I held my breath that she snatched my baby from me without asking me but then my mom and friend were also at this event and really wanted to see the baby, especially my friend who loves babies and hasn\u2019t seen him in about a month.  After about 15 minutes I took the baby back from my husbands grandmother and took him over to my mom and friend, as soon as my friend started holding the baby my husbands grandmother went over to her and tried to take the baby out of her arms.  This pissed me off, so I told her sternly that it was my friends turn to hold the baby and that she already had a turn and if we had time before we left she could have another turn. AITA for telling her it wasn\u2019t her turn to hold the baby?", "created_utc": 1688331203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14oyxs4/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_grandmother_it_wasnt/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And good on you for (eventually) standing up to her. The first time she snatched that baby out of your arms was the best time to call her out. But you still did good. Stay strong and do NOT let that woman walk all over you.", "NTA. Unfortunately some people need to be told things very clearly and simply. You need to keep doing this.", "NTA.  What does your husband think about it?", "NTA\n\nIt's not her baby.", "NTA. How annoying. Hopefully she just didn't realize how pushy she was being and will now think twice?", "NTA. Why\u2019d you wait so long to get him back tho?", "NTA. I was careful about being respectful regarding my own niece when I first met her at 4 months as I know it can be hard for some to let others hold their babies. I don't even want children but I still am 100% sure I'd hate an old person I don't even know well just take them out of my arms and go running around outside my control!\n\nThe child is 8 months now at which point those kids of feelings usually have strayed to cool down, but clearly this person hasn't received your trust, and with her actions I understand why.\n\nNot to mention that your family also is entitled to meet the child and to hog them like that is incredibly rude in itself. But even without your family being there you'd still not be TA. Your baby. Your rules, especially when people are being rude this way. It makes you not trust them, and of course you don't want someone you don't trust to hold your baby. I bet everything in you were screaming to take him back the whole time she held him. I understand you can't refuse her to hold him at all, without her going ballistic, but you definetely can create boundaries like this. He's at the age where he'll probably start being more afraid of people soon, and *do not* let anyone pressure him into being near them, hugging them, etc. Maybe even encourage him subtly (he'll look for small cues in you how you feel about people) in who to trust the most and not.. :)", "Uhhhh. NTA. Wtf? It\u2019s not her baby. That\u2019s kind of unnerving. It\u2019s not like she keeps pestering you by asking. That\u2019s an annoying thing to do. But she kept snatching your baby out of people\u2019s arms. I\u2019m not even sure if that\u2019s legal. I highly suggest you and your husband try to avoid interacting with her entirely. She seems like the kind of person to try to gain custody of your baby honestly\u2026 my grandmother did the same thing when I was younger. I have a restraining order against her now.", "NTA", "NTA. She purposely came and interrupted someone else\u2019s time and you are going to end up in the unfortunate position of doing this often. Your parent really needs to step in and reiterate this too, if he isn\u2019t already", "Grandma Snatchy  McGrabby needs to back the fuck up!!!  NTA", "He wasn\u2019t standing there when it happened, when I told him about it he wasn\u2019t impressed with his grandma.  He definitely thinks she overstepped as well.", "Reminds me of the leftovers, \"that is NOT your baby!\"", "I agree with your comment, but find your phrase \"an old person\" to be ageist. She is the baby's great-grandmother and has probably been holding babies for 75 years. She's not a criminal.", "Good on him for having your back. Good, bad or indifferent, it's critical to back up your partner (unless they're way off base.)", "Umm yeah she's stealing babies out of their mothers arms without regard. That's a criminal in my mind. The fact that she's old and likely weak and therefore more likely to drop the baby does not help"]}
