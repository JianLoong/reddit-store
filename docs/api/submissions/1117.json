Your daughter now belongs with her brothers and her father full time.", "First off, I\u2019m sorry for your and your family\u2019s loss, that sounds incredibly difficult. \n\nSecondly, I\u2019d say the best thing to do here is talk to Sophie, she\u2019s obviously one of the mainly injured parties and her input should be considered about her living situation. Make sure that any decision that is made is best for her and not just a point of pride for you or the grandmother. \n\nFinally, I\u2019d say that it sounds a lot like Laura\u2019s mom wants to replace Laura with Laura\u2019s daughter. \n\nThere is a middle ground here where your children have a healthy relationship with both sides of the family but it\u2019s going to take some work on the part of both sides to make that happen. You will probably have to be the one to take steps for that. Your former MIL is dealing with one of the worst kinds of pain that anyone can experience as she has outlived her child. \n\nGood luck.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I can't imagine any country that would give a grandmother custody over a father without any glaring problems (abuse, addiction, etc.). Tell grandma to go ahead and take you to court. But when you do so, please remind her how incredibly selfish it is to alienate her granddaughter from her own siblings- siblings that will likely be around to support said granddaughter far longer than she will.", "NTA Your Sophie's father, and at the end of the day she is still your responsibility, and right now given the circumstances it's best for her to be with you and her brothers.\n\nLook at engaging a lawyer to find out whether or not your state has grandparent rights and to protect your rights as Sophie's father and have said lawyer right organise for your ex mil to be served with an official cease and desist letter stating that she needs to stop harassing you over your daughter living with you, and as her parent you'll be doing what's best for your daughter and regardless of what she thinks your daughter is not her emotional support person and she needs to back off and owes both you and your children a huge apology for badmouthing you to your children's maternal family and as such until she no longer presents as a danger to both you and your children she'll no longer be permitted to be around your children for their emotional and physical wellbeing.", "NTA. You, as Sophie\u2018s parent, get to make this decision. It\u2019s awful that Laura\u2019s mother is trying to make you feel bad - obviously she\u2019s going through a difficult time, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse her behaviour.", "NTA. You are the parent, you have all the right. And it\u2019s not as if you were a deadbeat to begin with. I do understand the grief of the grandma though, she lost her daughter, maybe in some ways she feels less sad about Laura\u2019s death when Sophie is around. Or she feels that since Laura\u2019s gone, it\u2019s her responsibility to be Sophie\u2019s maternal figure.", "NTA\u2014 this is such a hard situation. Your exMIL has burned the bridges by going explosive about it, and I get that she\u2019s mourning but she caused irreparable destruction to your trust and relationship. \n\nIf she hadn\u2019t gone ballistic, it would have been nice if grandma continued to have visits but she\u2019s chosen to burn the bridges. \n\nAnd I\u2019m a worried about grandma anyway. Why is she nice to Sophie and not the boys? And since she went so quick to turning on you, I worry she was already into her plan to keep her when she was still there. Was she trying to poison Sophie against you, etc? \n\nAs you know, parenting requires keeping your cool and dealing with your not-favourite people for the sake of your kid and grandma failed spectacularly in that. A respectful conversation \u201cI love Sophie and it\u2019s very important to me to be in her life, can we please keep up these visits?\u201d\u2014 sounds like you would have been open to that conversation. As parents, we have to have these conversations with exes, family members, teachers, doctors, CAS, etc\u2014 it\u2019s hard! But it\u2019s what our kids need us to do. \n\nAt this point you can\u2019t let Sophie have an unsupervised visit or even phone call, I think it\u2019s not safe. She\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s an abduction risk and telling Sophie you\u2019re horrible is emotional abuse.", "NTA. She\u2019s your daughter and she now lives with her dad and brothers. That\u2019s how it always is, under normal circumstances, when mother passes away. I know your exMIL is grieving, but I don\u2019t know why she thought your daughter would stay with her. It almost seems like she had planned to keep her away from you.", "NTA, she\u2019s your daughter, so unless there\u2019s a glaring need or Sophie desperately wants to live with her grandma there\u2019s no reason that your ex MIL should get custody or primary care of your daughter. As long as you. Infinite to allow the grandmother to see her grandchildren you\u2019re doing the right thing-that\u2019s the default grandparent relationship. They get to see their grandchildren. They don\u2019t get to keep them just because they want to.", "NTA.. Grandma is a justno. Sophie deserves to be with her dad and brothers no matter what. Don't let Grandma plant seeds of doubt. Sophie may develop abandonment issues if you don't keep her. Kids REALLY need to be with their parents if possible.\n\nYou should probably cut off contact with Grandma now that she has threatened you with legal action. And check your state. Grandparent's rights don't exist everywhere.", "NTA\n\nbut you need to set up a visitation schedule...Sophie has the chance to have multiple people who love her in her life and as a parent you should encourage that.", "Ntan you are her legal father so you definitelydidnt do anything wrong by taking her home with you. Id ask the child what she wants first and then go with that whatever it is.", "Your children should be with you unless you are unable to care for them. They need the stability of their parent. Grandma doesn\u2019t get a say. Full stop. And if you don\u2019t put your foot down and fight for your child...all three of your children will see this and KNOW daddy didn\u2019t love them enough to fight for them. They see that. My kiddo has medical issues. She almost died about two years ago. One constant she always heard was that no matter what she was loved and we would ALWAYS fight for her because she deserved it. She made it through thankfully but every so often I hear her reference \u201cthey always fight for me.\u201d Grandma has zero say in your child\u2019s living arrangements unless you ask her if she can live with grandma. And if she tries to take you to court you can remind her that if she does that she gets ZERO contact with your children. With that said please let the kiddos see her (probably supervised is best at the moment so if she starts saying things you can nip it in the butt and cut the visit short) with the understanding before hand that if she tries to manipulate the kids or badmouth you that the visit is over and there will be a time out for x amount of time (find what you think is best. Maybe a month, maybe a year...depends on the transgression.). That way if she tries to pull the court/lawsuit on you (some states do have grandparent rights) you can say \u201cwe tried xyz but the kids were being manipulated and told I was bad so they needed to come to her. Your honor I can only do so much but I can\u2019t let her make the kids feel bad for being at home with their father.\u201d", "NTA \n\nPlease please do not send your daughter away - she deserves her remaining parent and her siblings in her life.", "NTA. You're they're father and legally they should stay with you.", "NTA so far. \n\nBut I think if Sophie expresses that she want's to live with her grandma at some point you should let her. Also let her know that's it's ok to want that and it's ok to say it if she wants it.", "NTA. Agree with all the above here. But would add, probably a good idea to get Sophie into therapy. \n\nNo one else find it fishy that the youngest child, also the only girl, was staying with the sick mother and grandparents but the boys moved away. \n\nFrom how I\u2019ve understood it it was the grandmother who wanted this set up. It feels like they\u2019re \u2018grooming\u2019 (can\u2019t think of a better word for it) Sophie to look after them when they get too old to look after themselves.", "NTA", "Seems like she wants a replacement daughter and doesn't care about what's best for Sophie or her brothers.", "NTA But please stop speaking with your ex-MIL, and get yourself to a lawyers office.  Your children do not need to be dragged through court proceedings while they are grieving their mother.\n\nShe just threatened to take one of your children, the moment someone makes a threat like that you must take them seriously and act accordingly.", "Info \u201cbest that Sophie stayed with her during Laura\u2019s treatment\u201d who is the her? The grandmother or Laura? And how long was this arrangement going on? For the whole 10 years? How often did you have time with Sophie while she was living with \u201cher\u201d \nI think overall NTA since Sophie is your daughter but this information might be critical. If Sophie spent the last 10 years living solely with the grandmas and seeing op infrequently, then op may be the asshole for disrupting Sophie\u2019s life during a traumatic time", "INFO:  If the ages are correct, Sophie was in a shared custody situation for pretty much her entire life right?  How old was she when her grandmother stepped in to replace her mother? During that time, was Sophie still still coming to stay with you on the agreed schedule?  Also, why did your sons not get along with their grandmother?", "NTA she is YOUR daughter. Grandma should be nice if she wants to see your children.", "I\u2019m so sorry for you and especially your kids. NTA, I think it\u2019s probably best for your daughter to be with her family. Her grandmother sounds a little unhinged.", "NTA.  Hire a lawyer, no further contact without a lawyer, no visits, no nothing.  Look up GPR in your state and see if they are a thing and prepare for hell.  It is your job to protect your family and keep your kids together.  Your daughter is not an emotional replacement for your ex-mil and anyone who says you are wrong just doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with her themselves.\n\nAlso, please start individual and family therapy for your kids to get help for the loss of their mother.", "In the US (I don\u2019t know where OP is) some states have grandparent rights where they courts will basically give them visitation just like if a marriage splits up. It\u2019s kinda crazy. They won\u2019t take custody from the parents but require the parents to provide access to the grandkids. I\u2019m over here: did the parents have a valid reason?", "His daughter is NOT an emotional support animal. Granny doesn\u2019t get the child bc it makes her feel less sad. She is a living human being who needs her family. It doesn\u2019t matter if granny feels less sad about her daughter\u2019s passing. Granny needs to go to therapy and get a dog.", "I tried that but she refused as she just wants sole custody.", ">Sophie is 11, not three - talk to your daughter, find out what she wants\n\nThis is all well and good for deciding dinner or clothes or a color of paint for the bedroom, not for choosing where to live.", "I think, under normal circumstances, this would be the way to go. But sounds like grandma is willing to badmouth daddy and manipulate to get the granddaughter (which is kinda sick and twisted bc she\u2019s trying to replace her daughter). Granny isn\u2019t in this to provide the best place for the daughter. She\u2019s in this for blood.", "I must admit I do agree with this and I have said it to Laura\u2019s family (which didn\u2019t make me look good and added more fuel to the fire!) Laura\u2019s mom was very protective of her and Sophie looks just like her so I think there may be something in her trying to replace Laura with Sophie.\nThe boys weren\u2019t treated very well by their grandmother\u2019s boyfriend. When they told me I removed them from Laura\u2019s house straight away with Laura\u2019s consent. The boyfriend is no longer in the picture and hasn\u2019t been since I agreed to Sophie staying with Laura and her mom. If he was then Sophie would of been living with me a lot earlier", "Laura\u2019s mom moved in with Laura while she was having treatment which was for the last 8 months of her life. Sophie lived with the both of them for four days of the week and me for three which was our arrangement before Laura got sick.", "Yes Sophie was just a baby when we split up. Laura\u2019s mom moved in with Laura and Sophie 8 months before she died. Sophie still came to me for three days out of the week right up to when her mom died. The boys had problems with their grandmothers boyfriend. The first two months that they all lived together he was living there too. When the boys told me what was going on I took them to live with me full time with Laura\u2019s consent. Laura\u2019s mom split up with the boyfriend as a condition of me letting Sophie stay.", "Record that all. Text granny regularly and ask if she would like to do xyz with you guys. When she responds no...print that text chat out and keep it for your records. If she won\u2019t text, record phone calls. That way if she tries to take you to court...you will have records of her refusing contact with the children. She wants to be manipulative...work it to your benefit. But if this is going on...ONLY supervised visits where you hear what is going on.", "then sadly court is the only option. However, take proof of offering her time and also go in offering visitation as that will impress the courts.\n\nYour ex MIL is grieving so I don't want to straight out call her awful... I hope it settles down with time", "Yeah you have a fair point there. It's a complicated situation all around without any obvious answers imo.", "Definitely not the asshole. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in this situation. Keep doing the best for your kids!"]}
