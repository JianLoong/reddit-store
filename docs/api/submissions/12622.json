How you can tell if you\u2019re doing something legit or not is you go into the store and present your issue in a truthful manner. In this example, hey ya\u2019ll I bought this mixer on the 6th for $30 and now it\u2019s $19. I want the difference in the price back. If they give it back to you then that\u2019s in their store policy to do so. If they do not then you have to resort to receipt switching to get your refund. The latter is fraud.", "That I won't get in trouble for it doesn't address my main objection.\n\nI can't speak to Walmart, but Target already offers sale price matching.

I don't think my decision to make a purchase there entitles me to lie if they later decide to reduce the price.", "This is not fraud. Its the same item and if i have a receipt that is eligible for a return, then its legal. No theft. Work smarter not harder."]}
