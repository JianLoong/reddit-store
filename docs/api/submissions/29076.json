Was your sister rude or hostile, or just honest? Was your dad at fault or was it your mom or a mutual falling out? How old was your sister at the time? Why wasn't there split custody?

Well done.", "ESH - your sister should speak to your dad directly, and you shouldn\u2019t give her lectures on her relationship with him.
