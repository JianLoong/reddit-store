Dad is barely involved, and my mom passed away 6 years ago. I'm a teacher, Uber driver, and a grad student so I work pretty hard.\n\nMy kids are usually pretty thoughtful, however, this Mother's Day they did next to nothing and it really hurt.\n\nI woke up at 6:30 and hung out alone for 4 hours. My daughter got up at 10:30, hugged me, and said \"Happy Mother's Day.\" Then added as an afterthought: \"Want me to cook breakfast or something?\" I said, \"I already ate\" and she left it at that.\n\nMy son woke up, got right on his new Zelda game, never said Happy Mother's Day. By the afternoon, I was visibly upset. I'm not normally one for guilt-tripping but I was really sad. My son asked if I was okay, but I just coldly said \"fine\" and he left. A few hours later my daughter took *one of my* blank cards from my desk, wrote a little Mother's Day card, and gave it to me.\n\nI did housework most of the day while they did nothing, including chores my daughter was already supposed to have done. I went to bed early and said nothing.\n\nIn the morning, I said \"bye\" to my son coldly and he didn't respond so as I left I started ranting to myself, \"Fine, don't say bye. You didn't even bother to say Happy Mother's Day yesterday.\" Please understand I am not normally petty or guilt-trippy, but this is the most I've ever been hurt by my kids. Their dad also didn't even text me which makes this the first Mother's Day he did nothing.\n\nAll day at work students and colleagues asked me, \"How was your mother's day? What did your kids do for you?\" so it got rubbed in my face all day. I went home upset and went straight to bed and started crying. My son eventually came and we talked. He said he was making a sculpture for me in art class but it's still in the kiln and he felt bad it wouldn't be ready in time so that's why he said nothing about Mother's Day (wtf?). He also said he was upset all day because I was so mad at him.\n\nNow my daughter is mad at me and when I tried to talk it out with her she accused me of hurting her feelings for being so mad at her and \"brushing her off\" when she offered to cook breakfast. And she claims she felt bad but there was nothing she could do for Mother's Day (also wtf?).\n\nMy daughter is an artist. I would have cherished a drawing or painting from her. Last year my son wrote me a poem and coded it into a video game level and I had to go in the game to find the poem. They could have done housework. They could have set an alarm and made a pot of coffee before I woke up. They could have made a damn construction paper card or picked a flower from outside. It's not about the lack of a gift, it's the lack of appreciation.\n\nThey are usually super sweet kids so I hope this is just some teenage phase, but I keep thinking how if my mom were alive I would give anything to spoil her on Mother's Day. So, AITA for being upset with my kids for 2 days about this and giving them the cold shoulder?", "created_utc": 1684199400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iqn5y/aita_for_giving_my_kids_the_cold_shoulder_after/", "score": 381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But can you think back to being 14? I admit, I probably skimmed a few mother's days with bare minimum effort. I didn't really think about my mom's feelings a hell of a lot. I relied on dad to guide the day and take me shopping for a gift. \n\nI think they're just being regular teenagers but you need to communicate more - just tell them what you'd like, organise a lunch...give them ideas. Trust me, it'll change one day just not yet.", "Sigh. YTA, and to be honest, you sound impossible to please. The amount of times you wrote \u201cwtf\u201d about your kids made me sad. The way you said \u201cbye\u201d to your son in such a cold way is ridiculous. Why not communicate like an adult? \n\nI\u2019m also a single parent and I spent Mother\u2019s Day doing chores, playing with my kid, and eating rainbow cookies with my kid. Earlier in the week, she asked if she could buy me a specific gadget for Mother\u2019s Day. I said yes, entered my credit card info, told her it would arrive after Mother\u2019s Day while she\u2019s with her dad, but that I wouldn\u2019t open the package and would wait for her to get home so she could wrap it if she wanted. She has been excited about this for days. \n\nFor every holiday, I give her money or an Amazon gift card since I know how much it means TO HER to get me something, and since I\u2019m the one who works (she\u2019s a kid) and manages the finances. She has some cash from relatives, but is too young to go to a store alone. \n\nI\u2019m content just hanging out and eating rainbow cookies, whether it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day or my birthday or just a random day. Oh, and playing Pok\u00e9mon. Or Zelda. I bought that game too and played it in between chores and the other games I was playing with my daughter. \n\nI just can\u2019t get over the \u201cwtf\u201d remarks. Jeez. Your kids sound like they were walking on eggshells, worried about how to make you happy. I hope they\u2019re not on Reddit because it would suck if they found your post. :(", "Soft YTA. You honestly sound overworked and overwhelmed, and you are taking it out on your kids.\n\nBut you are the adult here, and you won't fix anything by acting like a petulant child that didn't get what they wanted. \n\nYou said it yourself, your kids are super sweet all year round. I would rather have super sweet kids all year round than a kid that makes a card on Mother's day and act like shit the rest of the year.", "YTA Have people forgotten their kids are a reflection of them? Typically people aren\u2019t honest enough with themselves to see this. But I have friends that will complain about their kids for being exactly like they are.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter got up after you, wished you a happy Mother\u2019s Day, and offered to cook you something. You were an ass to her.\n\nYour son (different scenario) was a bit of an ass, but if what he said was true then whatever. He\u2019s 13, he doesn\u2019t have all the answers yet so why would you make either of your kids feel like shit especially when one of them did wish you a happy Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nYou need a reality check", "YTA, and if you keep this passive aggressive behavior up this year was a taste of what all your mothers days are gonna be like when your kids go low contact.  Your son didn\u2019t want to spoil the surprise he was working on, was probably upset it didn\u2019t come out on time, and woke up to you pissed off and probably a heads up from his sister (who offered to do something for you FIRST THING when she woke up, and you DID brush her off.) He was laying low to not make your day any worse.", "YTA, you are expecting adult interactions with children and that\u2019s just wild.", "YTA.\n\nYou said they are super sweet kids. If they routinely show you how much they love and care about you then why reduce their love to their actions on one manufactured holiday? I\u2019d rather have great kids who make an effort most of the time then kids who usually do nothing but then make breakfast once a year.\n\nI think the fact that this is the first year your ex didn\u2019t acknowledge things is part of your feelings. It sounds like it\u2019s the first year you felt like you were truly alone for the celebration. That\u2019s really tough and I understand why you were upset. However, don\u2019t turn this into a bigger issue by being petty.\n\nWhen feelings cool apologize for being snippy, remind them how much you loved their thoughtful gifts last year, and explain how much those things specifically on Mother\u2019s Day mean to you. Explain why you were hurt and let them apologize.\n\nGive them gentle reminders leading up to the holiday next year - they\u2019re still teenagers and time can be wobbley - and see what happens. And make sure you all appreciate each other year round.\n\nPlus, joking not joking, the largest video game release in years won\u2019t happen *every* Mother\u2019s Day.", "YTA, you're the parent. Communicate what you want.", "YTA\n\nIf this is the most you have ever been hurt by your kids, you really have no room to complain.", "Yta.  They acknowledged the day.  They are kids..... Not really sure you're being realistic here.  Being petty and giving them the cold shoulder is what absolutely makes you the A", "YTA\n\nThis is exactly why I don\u2019t do anything for my mom on Mother\u2019s Day anymore. Nothing I did was ever good enough. \n\nDaughter offered to cook breakfast, she signed you a card. That\u2019s not good enough for you. You\u2019re mad at her.\n\nSon was waiting and trying not to give you an un completed art work. Gift is a bit late. That thought isn\u2019t good enough either. He still thought of you. Bet you\u2019d be angry too if he gave you an un-fired piece of art .", "YTA- who are the children here you or them? You\u2019re giving your kids the silent treatment? Come on be more mature than that. Your daughter told you happy Mother\u2019s Day and offered to make your breakfast. That\u2019s great. And your son is being a typical 13 year old boy who did make you a gift. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect anything out of them honestly, they did more than I\u2019d expect from kids. You don\u2019t become a parent to get anything back from your kids, it\u2019s crazy to actually be mad at them. You\u2019re the parent", "YTA. I get being upset, but they didn't \"ignore\" Mother's Day. Your daughter offered to make you breakfast and both of them told you \"happy mother's day.\" \n\nBesides that, the gift your son made being late doesn't mean that he didn't get you anything.", "Yes, YTA. Part of me hopes somewhere deep inside you know you were TA, but this whole rant reeks of an emotionally immature parent taking out their feelings on their children (which is a form of abuse btw). \"Attention attention - mother of the year who sacrifices EVERYTHING for her ungrateful brat children gets her fee fees hurt.\" This is what this reads like. It sounds like your daughter did wish you a happy Mother's Day, but that wasn't good enough for you as you are so important, so you responded with attitude. Who wants to bet that is why your son tip-toed around you instead of also wishing you the same. Based on what you have reported in this post, you need some freaking therapy, and the kids deserve a mother who won't try to emotionally manipulate and abuse them. Emotional abuse is still abuse.", "YTA. It is unbecoming to be so emotionally needy towards your kids. It isn\u2019t their job to take care of you; it\u2019s yours to take care of them.

You woke up at 6:30am. You could've enjoyed the day and went back to sleep. Your daughter offered to make you breakfast, but you chose to brush her off and eat before she woke up.

THAT'S PETTY.\n\nYour son made you something in art class, felt bad that it wasn't ready in time, and didn't want to say, \"Happy Mother's Day,\" without his gift. \n\nTheir dad isn't your kid, and you said he's barely involved, so he doesn't owe you a, \"Happy Mother's Day.\" Again, PETTY.\n\nIf they do chores everyday, then having them done on that particular day isn't as special imo.\n\nYour kids are awesome, but you're clearly oblivious as to how petty you actually are.", "YTA \nThere's no reason to behave like this towards your children", "What are you a child?

You are doing an awful lot these days. I am sure you are just plain exhausted. I think that you wanted your daughter to just make breakfast for you. Instead of having to tell her you wanted it.

In fact I spent a good amount of time on the kitchen floor crying while I was cooking dinner for them.  You are human and wanting appreciation.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  But frankly our adult expectations don\u2019t always align with what kids are capable of giving.  It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love or appreciate us.  It\u2019s just that their teenage brains can\u2019t fully comprehend things the same way we do as adults.  You\u2019re NTA for being human and being hurt.

It sounds like it was a misstep at best, and you could have easily guided them a bit so that they would know what you wanted. You could have said thank you to your daughter for offering breakfast, and then suggested she make lunch or dinner instead. Does your son lie to you a lot? Is it possible that his 13 yr old brain really thought that was a good way to handle things, by ignoring everything? Was he trying to finish the gift for you like he said? Couldn't you have just asked him if he forgot it was Mother's Day? And I'd be willing to bet that you never had to think about Mother's Day when you were a kid. You probably had someone take you to get a gift for your mother, or they put your name on a card, or whatever.

Mom died when I was 12 but even then I\u2019ve always lit candles for her on mother\u2019s day, and I live 3000 miles from my grandma now but best believe I sent roses, cookies, and a candle yesterday.\n\nOffering to make someone breakfast hours after they regularly wake up isn\u2019t very thoughtful, but making a simple dinner would have been.\n\nIt does sound like you are super overworked and feeling under appreciated, so maybe practice some self care whenever you get the chance and show a little gratitude toward yourself.", "I totally understand how you feel and understand why you reacted the way you did.

To everyone who saying that they are kids and can not be expected to wake up early - BS. They are 13 and 15. I am pretty sure they know how to set the alarm and cook eggs.

An hour and a half later, I tired of waiting and found them watching TV.  Ok, not a great start.  I then asked if they wanted to go out and do something, and \"Nah\" from both.  My extremely supportive parents offered to take them to the store to buy me flowers. They ALWAYS gave me flowers for Mother's Day.  They declined. To say I was devastated would be a massive understatement.  My kids are a little spoiled, but not entitled and really sweet, great kids.  They were and still are my world.

From what you describe there was not only not any acknowledgment of that particular day, but no genuinely courteous behavior at all.

I'm a single mom. Dad is barely involved, and my mom passed away 6 years ago. I'm a teacher, Uber driver, and a grad student so I work pretty hard.\n\nMy kids are usually pretty thoughtful, however, this Mother's Day they did next to nothing and it really hurt.\n\nI woke up at 6:30 and hung out alone for 4 hours. My daughter got up at 10:30, hugged me, and said \"Happy Mother's Day.\" Then added as an afterthought: \"Want me to cook breakfast or something?\" I said, \"I already ate\" and she left it at that.\n\nMy son woke up, got right on his new Zelda game, never said Happy Mother's Day. By the afternoon, I was visibly upset. I'm not normally one for guilt-tripping but I was really sad. My son asked if I was okay, but I just coldly said \"fine\" and he left. A few hours later my daughter took one of my blank cards from my desk, wrote a little Mother's Day card, and gave it to me.\n\nI did housework most of the day while they did nothing, including chores my daughter was already supposed to have done. I went to bed early and said nothing.\n\nIn the morning, I said \"bye\" to my son coldly and he didn't respond so as I left I started ranting to myself, \"Fine, don't say bye. You didn't even bother to say Happy Mother's Day yesterday.\" Please understand I am not normally petty or guilt-trippy, but this is the most I've ever been hurt by my kids. Their dad also didn't even text me which makes this the first Mother's Day he did nothing.\n\nAll day at work students and colleagues asked me, \"How was your mother's day? What did your kids do for you?\" so it got rubbed in my face all day. I went home upset and went straight to bed and started crying. My son eventually came and we talked. He said he was making a sculpture for me in art class but it's still in the kiln and he felt bad it wouldn't be ready in time so that's why he said nothing about Mother's Day (wtf?). He also said he was upset all day because I was so mad at him.\n\nNow my daughter is mad at me and when I tried to talk it out with her she accused me of hurting her feelings for being so mad at her and \"brushing her off\" when she offered to cook breakfast. And she claims she felt bad but there was nothing she could do for Mother's Day (also wtf?).\n\nMy daughter is an artist. I would have cherished a drawing or painting from her. Last year my son wrote me a poem and coded it into a video game level and I had to go in the game to find the poem. They could have done housework. They could have set an alarm and made a pot of coffee before I woke up. They could have made a damn construction paper card or picked a flower from outside. It's not about the lack of a gift, it's the lack of appreciation.\n\nThey are usually super sweet kids so I hope this is just some teenage phase, but I keep thinking how if my mom were alive I would give anything to spoil her on Mother's Day. So, AITA for being upset with my kids for 2 days about this and giving them the cold shoulder?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It takes a small person to do that. The story can across so narcissistic.", "Are you for real?  Your kids are teenagers and have limited resources.  Does your daughter even have the independence/money to buy a Mother's Day card?  They're working with what they have, and for your daughter that was offering to cook breakfast, and your son wanted to give you an art project, but the timing was off.  You could have absolutely communicated that you would love a drawing from your daughter, or that you'd appreciate them doing extra chores.  Instead you're behaving like a child by giving them the silent treatment.  YTA", "YTA!!! As a single mom you should know there's no father to help your teenage kids with mother day.

I can understand feeling hurt by your kids not acknowledging the day as much as you would have liked, but they are quite young still. YTA because while one can understand you feeling hurt to an extent, you\u2019re the adult and you are supposed to manage your emotions in a healthier way than passively aggressively taking it out on your kids. You did not directly communicate anything to them and expected them to guess what you were feeling and read your mind and fix things. I also kind of get the vibe that you\u2019re maybe unconsciously wanting your kids to fulfill some emotional needs for you since the Dad isn\u2019t in the picture. What you wrote sounds more like someone being upset their husband didn\u2019t show them appreciation on a special day, instead of understanding realistically you\u2019re talking about a 13 and 15y/o kid", "[removed]", "If that's the way you usually behave when they don't meet your expectations, it's no wonder they didn't go much out of their way to celebrate the day.

As a near adult, I now realize how much I love and appreciate my own mom. but at 13 i did not give a fuck about anyone's feelings but my own. it's okay to feel disappointed, but in all honesty, you're a single parent and people who usually celebrate mother's day typically are directed or have help from the other parent. maybe it's not the same as having your kids do it without your help, but suggesting that y'all do something or telling them what you want to do will make mother's day fun for all of y'all. In the future, when they're older, they'll likely put more effort in without your help to surprise you.", "I'm a mum and in all honesty I'm indifferent about mother's day,but I'm sorry you were hurt.

You could have two teenagers that are rebelling, doing drugs, ignoring curfews and causing you worry all year! Expecting teenagers to get up at six just because it's Mother's day is unrealistic and you could have actually done something nice during that time to treat yourself. Would have been the perfect time for a cuppa,face mask and deep conditioner on your hair. \n\nI don't think the asking about breakfast was an after thought either, you've just taken it like that because you were hurt. You could have said thanks sweetie,I was hungry so I've eaten how about you make lunch instead for me? We also know what teens are like when new games come out, especially Zelda that they have been waiting for for years. It was our wedding anniversary last week and my son didn't twig until I mentioned the day before we were both day off. He then had the do you want me to buy you a card panic and we were like nah.\n\nYour flounce was totally out of order. How can you say they don't appreciate you when you have raised them single handedly and they are good kids? Do you really need one day in the year only for them to show you that?

The irony of this post is insane lol they\u2019re KIDS. They\u2019re still teenagers, honestly you\u2019re lucky they even said HMD. Especially if they\u2019re usually very thoughtful.

Your daughter offered to make you breakfast and when you were, frankly, mean and IMMATURE (obviously she picked up on it, since she said her feelings were hurt) she got hurt and was afraid to bring anything else up to you the rest of the day. Which is your own fault. Sure, you can bring this up to your kids in a kind way, telling them you were sad while still being understanding they\u2019re just people too. You\u2019re reaction to this is very petty, immature, and manipulative. I hope to god when you say you\u2019re not usually like this that it\u2019s the truth.

I don't think they understand how things like Mothers Day can be fairly important to us Mums.\n\nThey do sound like good kids though and your daughter communicated with emotional intelligence.\n\nGet them together, say sorry for how you were sulky on Mothers Day (I've sulked too - parents are human).

She gave you a card, who cares if it came from your desk?! It's the same idea as if you give a kid money for a Christmas present for you, and they bring you one back. It's the thought that counts.

They are also not responsible for your ex not messaging you. Nor do they need to bear the weight of what you would have done for your mother.

Heck, this year, I brewed the tea and cooked the little finger foods and shopped for the fancy crumpets myself (indulgent ones--they were a gift in themselves), and did the dishes afterwards while they video chatted my mother-in-law for her Mother's Day call, and I still call it a win, because everyone sat down to tea, nobody complained about having what *I* wanted to eat and drink, and we had a good time together! The rest--gifts, meals, cards, flowers, etc-- is gravy, when I get the reasonable, achievable thing I'd asked for. \n\nYour daughter took the initiative to ask if you wanted breakfast. You *did* brush her off, as she said; instead of saying, \"Well, I already ate, but if you wouldn't mind making me some more coffee and taking care of breakfast for yourself while I just relax and hang out with you, I think that would be nice,\" you just said you already ate (with obvious subtext of, \"So you already missed the boat on pleasing me.\") She took the initiative to write you a note, and you took it as a slap in the face, but I hate to say it... Who cares when she wrote the sentiment? You could have kept that little card to re-read when she moves out, but it's probably tainted by your attitude about it...\n\nWhen your son asked if you were ok, you should have told the truth. \"I'm kind of hurt that you haven't even told me Happy Mother's Day...\" It might have prompted him to tell you about the sculpture running late and his embarrassment about it, and you could have said, \"Oh, I can't wait to see it! In the meantime......\" and suggest what you'd have him do. He's 13. His resources--financial, logical, and emotional--are limited. \n\nIt's normal that you felt let down. But I think you not communicating with your kids and holding adult expectations of them spiralled your emotions to a place that was outsized for what your kids were/weren't doing.", "YTA\n\nBeing a single mother must be so difficult and it must have hurt your feelings but \"Silent treatment\" / \"Cold shoulder\" is emotional abuse. It's a common way of dealing with conflict but abuse none the less. Your kids aren't mind readers, nor are they emotionally mature enough to fully understand the reason for your annoyance/upset.\n\nAsk yourself, next year do you want your kids to celebrate mother's day with you out of love or out of fear of repercussions?\n\nIt puts a lot of pressure on your eldest to play peacemaker which will lead to issues later in life - I speak from experience. \n\nOn a slightly less serious note - I don't know a single teenager that got up at 6.30am through choice XD", "YTA.

Sometimes they need reminding of how much last year's thoughtful gift meant to you & how much you loved their personal passions & talents being your gift.  \n\nIt's tough but I reckon this is fixable & you 3 love each other alot trying to save each other's feelings.", "Only a little. It would likely have been more beneficial to ask if there were plans made a few days ahead of time to see if your kids wanted to wake up early with you or to tell them what made you upset and thus promote healthy communication habits with them, and you were emotional and probably wanted to give a small test. I think tests on big days are not a good idea, personally, they\u2019ve never proven to show trust never promotes healthy speaking habits, and rarely end very well in my opinion and observation. However I am proud of you for speaking to them eventually. Does it make sense though that they would be upset as well?

Right now, you\u2019re sending the message that your love is conditional, something that you can and will take away if they ever do anything to displease you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think it\u2019s important that they understand the hard work that goes into building a life (meals don\u2019t appear from nowhere!) but I feel like this has a decidedly transactional bent for you and I don\u2019t like it. \n\nFurthermore\u2014your kids actually *did* do stuff for you. Your daughter offered to cook you breakfast, and you said no. What were you expecting her to do, exactly? She offered to do a special thing, and you declined, so you\u2019re mad at her for\u2026not realizing that you actually did want the special thing that you told her you didn\u2019t want? Come on. That kind of passive-aggressive bullshit is exhausting when teenagers do it, and you\u2019re an actual adult. And you\u2019ve been at it for two days! Get off the cross, dude. We need the wood.

I was about to \u201cesh\u201d this post because I literally saved my own birthday/holiday money to buy my mother jewelry at like ten years old, but I\u2019m also now realizing how gaslit by my mother I was after reading all these comments. I cooked, cleaned, did all the right things. And it was never enough for her. I was always guilted for my existence and her having to be a single mother, how much she had to sacrifice, how much she did for us. I spent my entire childhood feeling guilty for being produced.

Other important occasions or holidays? Or was it just in a rom com you watched recently?", "You're right they are teens, they are nowhere near matured fully mentally. Guys don't even fully mature until 35, but that's another story. It's great you treated your mom like that, but that was your choice and you can't be upset if they don't show appreciation the same way you did. They aren't you, even though they came from you. We also don't always get what we want as mother's either, I learned that the first time I got brutally sick and still had to perform all my mom duties. Are we grossly underappreciated for what all we do? Yes, but we can't take it out on our children either. They still appreciated you, even if it wasn't to the degree you felt you deserved.", ">Take it easy on yourself, mama! You had a rough, emotional day with your kids\n\nThat's an *extremely* nice way to put her behaviour that bordered on emotional abuse, but sure.", "Sounds very much like my narcissist dad.  He used to give me the silent treatment for days when I was a teen. \n\nOP, I'll tell you,  I learned nothing from his behavior in this regard, other than we were basically playing a game where I had to grovel to get it to stop.  I remember being 16 or so and telling my friend: \"Well,  dad has been giving me the silent treatment since last night.  Guess when I get home, I've gotta kiss his ass .\"\n\nEventually,  I started behaving the same way when I was upset. It took a long time for my husband to help me understand that the silent/cold shoulder treatment does nothing to resolve conflict.

Uncomfortable?\n\nI wish EVERYONE I hated would shut the fuck up to \"punish\" me. Shit, even people I mildly dislike would be tolerable if they'd shut the fuck up.\n\nI don't see how that's a punishment.
