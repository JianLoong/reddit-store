That\u2019s shitty.\n\nA fancy espresso machine is a luxury item, and one that your wife would use purely for her own enjoyment and not yours. I think she\u2019s got some weird ideas about presents. You went out of your way to get a sweet and thoughtful gift. Sorry that your wife reacted that way.", "NTA\n\nIt's a great, and thoughtful, gift.\n\nIt's not what those articles are about - they're about gifts that say 'here, go do housework' like vacuums or washing machines.

Your wife is acting like a spoiled brat.  Send the machine back.", "NTA. This is obviously a luxury item on your budget and it's not exactly an appliance. But it kind of is, so I can see there being disputes over this. The fact that she kept pushing for it is EASILY taken as a hint that this was a desired gift.", "Appliances that help with chores etc are a no-no but this is an awesome gift especially since she\u2019s been wanting one. I don\u2019t think she understands the difference. NTA.", "NTA.  Maybe something else is going on with your wife and you need to discuss it with her, but getting her a fancy espresso machine which she will be the majority user of is in no way being a bad husband.  What is going on with the world if thoughtful gifts like this are now viewed as something bad?  It\u2019s not like you bought her a vacuum and told her to go clean something!", "NTA and that's weird. That's clearly a luxury item that only she would use that she has been vocally pining for for quite a while and does not seem to have had any attempt to buy one for herself. It's not like she wanted the espresso machine but you got her a vacuum cleaner instead. Could she perhaps not realize how nice the one you got is?

I don't need more stuff to just sit here and look pretty, while I am struggling with chores that could be made easier.  Also, funds are not unlimited.

Her reaction is very unusual.", "NTA  \n\nI'm personally a coffee enthusiast and I've probably splurged more than you might imagine on coffee related hardware. I'm assuming from what you wrote that you got her a machine from Breville's Barista line, which depending on the model are not easy on the wallet, and are a kind of stepping stone into espresso machines that range even higher for hobbyists. If I were in her shoes, I would be beside myself with happiness to get it and work on perfecting my pulls; from her reaction, it seems like she's not too interested in the hobby aspect, which is totally fine. In that case though, even a cheaper pod espresso machine would be sufficient as an upgrade from her current set-up.  If you're accurately representing the frequency of your wife expressing desire for the espresso machine, I think pretty much anyone would take it to mean that she is excited to pursue espresso making as a *hobby*, and not solely as a means to get some caffeine in the morning, so splurging for that espresso machine was a very reasonable and thoughtful decision in my opinion.", "NTA. And I think the fault is more your wife's for reading the articles than yours for not reading them.", "The \"Don't get your wife an appliance\" I would think generally applies to oven, dishwasher, vacuum cleaner, crock pot, etc. This is something that's not for the family or for housekeeping, it's something she wanted to make the coffee SHE likes.

It doesn't make sense that she would be so angry.  Even if it was something she didn't want being angry about you making an effort is ridiculous. You can always send it back.  \n\n\nI noticed that after telling you she wants something just for her she didn't clarify what that might be.  What a chore to have go through a guessing game like this.  She needs to communicate better.", "NTA. \n\nThis is something your wife has been asking for, I think she completely overreacted and is out of line.", "If i was your wife i'd be pissed you got me an expensive appliance that ive been fawning over for months. Good thing im not your wife. Send it my way instead lol. \n\nNta. Get her a cheap bracelet from etsy.", "NTA, she's being ungrateful, and her sending you those articles was rude and uncalled for.

The whole don\u2019t give appliances for gifts is just a goofy concept.

Nobody but her can or  will use it.", "NTA I have bought my wife multiple coffee appliances for birthdays or Christmas over the years. She's loved each one", "NTA.

My husband did the same thing for me and I\u2019ve had my $1200 coffee maker for 20 years. He didn\u2019t even drink coffee when he bought it. It\u2019s still the best give he\u2019s ever given me. Your wive is being an ungrateful \u201cB\u201d! Return it and give her nothing.", "NTA. Her response is absolutely unhinged. You bought her something for herself, not a vacuum cleaner.

My husband got me something similar as a gift and I was thrilled. And he uses it as much as I do! I don\u2019t care, I get to have latte\u2019s whenever I want, and that\u2019s a great gift. It\u2019s a luxury, it\u2019s not like you got her a mop!", "I actually disagree with the comments saying it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s not an appliance related to cleaning etc. it\u2019s still a household item.\n\nI knew someone that got his wife a shower head for Christmas. It\u2019s not a cleaning thing\u2026But it\u2019s still just a household thing that\u2019s not gonna light her up. He claimed it was this expensive special shower head she would love etc, but yeah\u2026Just trust me, women are sick of this stuff as gifts. \n\nIt\u2019s nuanced. It just ties in to the way women are often treated as homemakers and not their own person outside the home. I\u2019m sure she has hobbies and interests that would make a great present. Doesn\u2019t matter if they aren\u2019t as practical or don\u2019t get used much. Why? Because gift giving isn\u2019t about practicality!\n\nIf it was, we\u2019d all be giving each other dishwasher tablets as presents. \n\nHave you ever been excited about socks for Christmas? Let\u2019s face it, things that are practical rarely make a good gift.\n\nHow often something will get used just isn\u2019t a good measure to go by. \n\nDon\u2019t think YTA because it seems like a thoughtful gift, but I just wanted to share the female perspective. Her feelings are valid so she\u2019s NTA either.", "NTA.\n\nI'm more curious that your wife was on your phone, and that you both know each other's phone passwords. Is this normal? To me, it signals some underlying trust issues are in play.", "NTA - My wife loves coffee and would have been thrilled to get something like this. It's not like it's a vacuum cleaner or a washing machine.", "Uh huh. Sure.", "ESH - I know how you feel, my wife has done that to me too many times to count.  Best to just stick with a romantic getaway for just the two of you with all the frills for her.  Being practical about gift for the wife never works.  Never.", "Hahaha. 100% yta. Lol.

I would seriously stick with gift cards from now on, if that.", "You aren\u2019t OP", "Very fair point.\n\nEDIT: It's a lot of wild speculation either way. OP never said wife was \"calling in an order for pizza\" or bringing out the phone to him because it was ringing. Not enough details to fill in the blanks...", "Imagine getting a blender or dish washer for your birthday.", "I think the whole post is odd.  He's never heard of not giving your wife an appliance for her birthday? Seems unlikely.", "Yeah imagine, that's why this wasn't a blender or dishwasher. Imagine context actually being important.", "That was my thought!", "Yes, the context is that it's an appliance. Not a gift. \n\nHe learned. He will not do it again.", "Back when my husband and I were poor he gave me a vacuum cleaner for our anniversary.  We'd agreed on it ahead of time, but even all those years ago we made a joke about the husband giving his wife an appliance for a special occasion."]}
