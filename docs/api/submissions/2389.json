Why didn't she do the things she now does for your cousin for you back then? Where the circumstances different and she couldn't or did she just not care/want to do them? In the first case it would have been insensible for you to rub in her face and you would be TA.", "INFO how long ago was your childhood?

They got new dishes and furniture sets and started eating more expensive food, got to go out to eat more, etc. That\u2019s just the way life shakes out sometimes. I was jealous at times obviously that growing up I didn\u2019t have it as good, but I wouldn\u2019t throw that in my parents\u2019 face", "NTA. You aren't.

My dad is the same way with his step kids but I'm mostly glad he's grown up a lot as a father figure and I understand I was his first time and he was young and had issues then that have sense worked out.", "YTA. \nI get the frustration, but that cousin isn\u2019t you. If she\u2019s doing it now, praise her for trying her best and being considerate. When people are praised, they tend to be more inclined to act that way in the future.", ">Mom is feeling a heightened sense of obligation for some reason.\n\nDoesn't want to look like a bad mother or host to the extended family. If the mum doesn't do stuff for OP and their siblings, nobody will bat an eye as long as it's not going too far. If she does the same she may be scared that her sibling will call her out", "That was my question to her why she was going over the top. Circumstances from now to then is that she doesn\u2019t have anymore kids to take care of so she works less but has better income than she did before", "Im now 27 and was the youngest that got all the shit hand me downs. I have never complained before and yes their financial situation changed they are only semi responsible for one underage person opposed to 3 when I was growing up so of course money isn\u2019t as tight.", "This! OP sounds jealous and is looking to start a fightto make their mom feel bad about not having the resources 10+ years past that she has now. Sadly sometimes older kids dont get the luxuries that younger ones (or younger cousins in this case) get. Be happy for your mom thats shes now in a better situation. OP YTA.", "What boundaries?", "I don\u2019t think she is all money is getting sent directly to cousin and what hits a nerve more is kid decided to get airpods with the money that was sent to her instead of using it to buy things like rain gear I say it\u2019s time she learns responsibility.", "Eh it gives mixed feelings. I've seen how different my parents were with me and my younger brother and I'm glad he doesn't have to go through what I did. But it did hurt that I still suffered. It's still sometimes a sore spot", "Then theres your answer. She has less worries and more money. Also shes older and could possibly feel remorse for the way she brought you guys up. I seen it with my grandma who raised me completely different from my dad and aunts. They asked the same questions and the answer was basically the same. Seems like she just wants to try a different parenting style. Idk and it really sucks for y'all but you can take solace in knowing that if you have children they will be well taken care of by grandma so thats a plus in my book", "For me it sounds like she couldn't do everything for you eventhough she maybe wanted to or she realised that she could have done more and now she is trying to compensate this and you made it worse by reminding her what she didn't do for you. Maybe try to focus on everything she did for you back then.", "Frankly YTA, sounds like your parents did the best they could for you with limited resources. They're also doing their best for your cousin - but their resources are less limited.\n\nIf it was a case of your parents wilfully neglecting you as a child and then being good \"parents to your cousin I'd understand your reaction. But you've made your mom feel like shit for no reason", "[deleted]", "I wonder if she spends all her money on the child will she have any time or energy or money left for the grandkids? She\u2019ll just treat them the same way she treated her kids.", "I always hate that attitude since it doesn't actually make anything better for the kids that did suffer. It feels like a cop out to go \"I can't do anything to change the past but I'll make sure not to repeat the same mistakes\" without then also trying to make amends to the kids you did wrong", "Emotions are weird. I can definitely see where OP is coming from too. They've had to go their childhood without because mum couldn't afford it but now that she has money she spends it on the cousin who isn't her child. It can feel unfair that someone else gets the stuff you missed out on just because you were born to your parents at the wrong time.", "Very young I was a latch key kid, learned to cook and clean at around 10. I didn\u2019t have my own money til I worked never got an allowance so when I did get money you bet I was careful with it got myself through school with minimal debt. I would say at this point it is my mothers responsibility to teach her a lesson to better spend money on necessities and not stupid stuff. If she keeps saving her after each time she wastes money she\u2019ll never learn.", "True and she still has kids what is she doing for her adult kids now? Why should she or he be paying for anything the kid has parents.\n\nI don\u2019t care what anybody says when you grow up poor and now all of a sudden somebody else is getting all the rewards it\u2019s gotta be hard to watch. Tell her that her parents need to buy her stuff that you\u2019re gonna take care of your family. \n\nIf she has all the money now to do nice things for somebody else why isn\u2019t she paying for a vacation for her children?  Why isn\u2019t she spending some of that extra money on her kids to make up for what they didn\u2019t get when they were younger? Seems to me she didn\u2019t care about her kids and this kid has parents.", "[deleted]", "I wouldn\u2019t do many things my parents did but I also wouldn\u2019t overcompensate how my mom is doing now"]}
