NTA", "NTA.  He bought a house and expected you to move and pay half of everything to the tune of $1150 a month?  If he wanted that, he should have said so *before* he bought the house.  If you pay $700 at his house, you should get one of the bedrooms for yourself.", "NTA. It was his job to figure out how the house was going to be financed before he purchased it. If he was relying on you paying half that should have been communicated a long time ago, same with the roomate situation. You are perfectly justified in staying in your current (more affordable) living situation.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a situation where you pay $700 now, so why pay more? Sure there are reasons to pay more- more space, better location, building equity- but you have made a money calculation and the amount he wants doesn't work for you. \n\nHe should have told you his thinking before buying the house. Sure, he said the house is \"for us\" but that implies you will live together, not the breakdown of finances. \n\nI would much rather save $450 a month then live with my partner and not get equity. I love him, but that's a substantial amount of money. And since he didn't communicate clearly and is unwilling to compromise, I'd already wonder if this relationship will last, so why move in together?\n\nAnd I can't resist pointing out that it isn't \"ungrateful\" when someone does something that doesn't benefit you in any way, nor did you ask for it. His use of that word is a red flag, because it demonstrates an attitude of him making decisions for both of you, and then expecting you to agree and contribute, or else be a bad person.", "NTA, your boyfriend is either a schemer, an idiot, or an idiotic schemer.\n\nYour paying $700 where you are now, so its in your financial interest not to move in with him.\n\nHe bought a house thats a him problem.  \n\nUsually when couples buy a house married or not they have some serious discussions and input from each other.", "NTA.

It'd be a different decision if you'd agreed to move in before he got the house, helped him find the house, had input on it, and didn't feel cornered into overpaying what you aren't willing to right now without the manipulative 'threat' of 'bringing in a roommate'. These are all decisions he made without you.\n\nYou might want to take a look at if that's a pattern or not.", "Info: how long have yall been together?

He did not purchase this house for \"you\" or you would have been involved in what he chose, would have agreed to pay part of the mortgage and having your name on the property.

Since this is for your, plural, future. You pay him half of what he put into the house. Then you get put into the deed. From then on you pay half.\n\nYou also sign a contract that if either of you breaks up or wants to sell. The house has to be sold at market value. You split the proceeds. If either tries to interfere with the sale. There are financial penalties. There should also be a survivorship clause.\n\nThis is totally fair. Both of you are covered in a breakup. Both of you are equally vested.\n\nOtherwise the most you\u2019ll pay is comparable rental rates for the house. You get your own lockable room to do what you want with as does he . The master, common areas and garage are 50% shared. Meaning neither has final say so in decorations or furniture. You also get a one year rental agreement. Which only you can break (excepting non payment/lease violations). If you break up, that is a valid reason for you to break the lease without notice.

If you break up, he would keep all the equity and you wouldn't. May as well stay in your apartment. He made the choice, not you. There's consequences to every action; good or bad. It's not being ungrateful. Especially if it was something you had no input in.\n\nBut you TA for trying to tell him who he may or may not have as a room mate.", "NTA you could end up paying for half of the house when owning none of it. I think your view of around 700 is correct for your share of the bills plus a little rent is the fair amount. He shouldn't have bought the house just expecting you to pay for half of it.", "NTA. Your partner is expecting you to pay half his mortgage without an equal exchange of equity in the home. He is essentially trying to make money off of you. \n\nIf he isn\u2019t planning to get you to sign a rental agreement, he also would likely be able to get away with not claiming the money you pay as rental income. Meaning he would get the tax deduction for the mortgage without having to pay any tax on the income (your rent). \n\nEven if you sign a rental agreement, he\u2019s still making money off you, just not as much. I wouldn\u2019t move in with him without an agreement stating that I get equity in the home with every mortgage payment I contribute to.", "NTA. He's allowed to charge his tenants what he wants, you're not obliged to become his tenant. You two aren't married or cohabitating so using the \"our house\" card doesn't really work.", "This is shady. Stay in your apartment.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He is trying to get you to pay half of his mortgage. If he has to get roommates in order to afford his own place then he is living above his means.

As you\u2019ve said in a comment, you have only been together for a year. To me, for him to buy a house on his own but expect you to act like you both have equal claim on it is wrong. It feels like too much of a financial imbalance if you want this to be a long term relationship. He holds the full title to the house, but expects you to contribute towards it equally? I believe in people contributing equally to a house if you are both living in it. But, when you bring in the fact that you would be paying half of his mortgage but wouldn\u2019t own half of the house, that makes me uncomfortable.", "NTA. He bought the house expecting you to pay half without telling you so he wouldn\u2019t have to have roommates. Sounds a little fishy. Why would you want to pay more for somewhere to live?", "NTA, if you break up what do you get for paying down his mortgage. Don\u2019t do it unless your getting something if you break up. I\u2019d stay where you are and save up.", "Nah\n\nIf you don't want to move in fine. But if you don't he can definitely get whatever roommate he wants to help with the mortgage.\n\nDoesn't matter gender", "NTA. You should not pay more than $700 for your share of rent in his house. And since you don't get your own room it should probably be a little less. Hes probably trying to charge you so much because he cant afford it. Which really should have been a conversationbefore he bought the house. Ask him to lower the rent, and also let you pick the other roommates so it can be someone your comfortable with.", "NTA. If you are going to pay half of the mortgage, it\u2019s only fair that you receive 50% ownership as well. If he wants all the benefits of ownership, then he can rent out rooms at the going rate for your area. If you want to take on roommates, how about another couple?", "NTA, he didn't consult you at all and expects you to pay more in living expenses just to move in with him.

Her opinion didn't change the last several months. She decided to let him buy the place without making her intentions clear. \n\nYou can argue he is an asshole for making certain assumptions while preoccupied with the broader scope, but OP is still also an asshole for intentionally hiding her stipulations from him until after the deed was already signed.

When my partner moved in with me, his split was less than what his rent had been so it was fair. My current partner bought a house without my input. At the end if the day, only the person buying the house needs to think about the money. If he can\u2019t afford a house on his own then HE should have talked to OP.

Women make less on average than men, and yet are expected to contribute half of expenses. And yeah, sure, there are women who make more than men, and in that case she should be expected to contribute an equitable amount of her salary, but there\u2019s no implication in that comment to suggest women can\u2019t support themselves or need a man to pay for them or just want a man to pay for them. I make exactly half what my partner does. It would not be fair for me to pay half our living expenses. We divvy them up by percentage of income. If I was single, I would live within my means and be able to support myself, but we share our life, and unless he wants to live within in my financial means, then he\u2019ll have to contribute more dollars while I contribute fewer dollars, but as long as we\u2019re contributing an equal percentage of our incomes toward shared expenses then it is equitable. Say 25% of each of our incomes goes toward shared expenses, then we each get to keep 75% of our incomes for whatever we choose. That is equitable. \n\nYou are missing the point quibbling about home equity. That\u2019s not what this is about. What this is about is that women are generally expected to pay half of shared expenses despite making less. What\u2019s really at issue here is equality vs equity. Women and other marginalized groups are gonna be fighting this battle for years, and it\u2019s precisely because of opinions like this. There\u2019s no \u201cvictim mentality\u201d in stating facts. \n\nThe implication you\u2019re making is that women who earn less but don\u2019t want to contribute 50% are gold diggers or sugar babies, and that\u2019s fucked. If a man makes 100k a year and the woman makes 50k a year, then it\u2019s not equal if both partners split rent 50/50. That means man keeps more of his paycheck than woman keeps of hers. That\u2019s not equality. So please, spare me this \u201cwomen just want to be kept women bullshit.\u201d It\u2019s harmful.
