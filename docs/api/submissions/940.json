NTA", "NTA.  He bought a house and expected you to move and pay half of everything to the tune of $1150 a month?  If he wanted that, he should have said so *before* he bought the house.  If you pay $700 at his house, you should get one of the bedrooms for yourself.", "NTA. It was his job to figure out how the house was going to be financed before he purchased it. If he was relying on you paying half that should have been communicated a long time ago, same with the roomate situation. You are perfectly justified in staying in your current (more affordable) living situation.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a situation where you pay $700 now, so why pay more? Sure there are reasons to pay more- more space, better location, building equity- but you have made a money calculation and the amount he wants doesn't work for you. \n\nHe should have told you his thinking before buying the house. Sure, he said the house is \"for us\" but that implies you will live together, not the breakdown of finances. \n\nI would much rather save $450 a month then live with my partner and not get equity. I love him, but that's a substantial amount of money. And since he didn't communicate clearly and is unwilling to compromise, I'd already wonder if this relationship will last, so why move in together?\n\nAnd I can't resist pointing out that it isn't \"ungrateful\" when someone does something that doesn't benefit you in any way, nor did you ask for it. His use of that word is a red flag, because it demonstrates an attitude of him making decisions for both of you, and then expecting you to agree and contribute, or else be a bad person.", "NTA, your boyfriend is either a schemer, an idiot, or an idiotic schemer.\n\nYour paying $700 where you are now, so its in your financial interest not to move in with him.\n\nHe bought a house thats a him problem.  \n\nUsually when couples buy a house married or not they have some serious discussions and input from each other.", "NTA.

He's angry that you don't fall in line and pay more than you are now, and for what?

He can want whatever he wants, but he doesn't get to narrate your entire life story without any input from the other half of the relationship. It'd be a different decision if you'd agreed to move in before he got the house, helped him find the house, had input on it, and didn't feel cornered into overpaying what you aren't willing to right now without the manipulative 'threat' of 'bringing in a roommate'. These are all decisions he made without you.\n\nYou might want to take a look at if that's a pattern or not.", "Info: how long have yall been together? And he didn't include you in searching for this place at all?", "Nope.  You are a rational adult with your own budget to worry about.  He did not purchase this house for \"you\" or you would have been involved in what he chose, would have agreed to pay part of the mortgage and having your name on the property.

Since this is for your, plural, future. You pay him half of what he put into the house. Then you get put into the deed. From then on you pay half.\n\nYou also sign a contract that if either of you breaks up or wants to sell. The house has to be sold at market value. You split the proceeds. If either tries to interfere with the sale. There are financial penalties. There should also be a survivorship clause.\n\nThis is totally fair. Both of you are covered in a breakup. Both of you are equally vested.\n\nOtherwise the most you\u2019ll pay is comparable rental rates for the house. You get your own lockable room to do what you want with as does he . The master, common areas and garage are 50% shared. Meaning neither has final say so in decorations or furniture. You also get a one year rental agreement. Which only you can break (excepting non payment/lease violations). If you break up, that is a valid reason for you to break the lease without notice. With automatic renewal if you two decide to stay together at the end of each year.", "NTA, LOL, he sounds like the worst landlord you\u2019re seriously going to fund his home that he can kick you out of any old day he pleases? Sounds divine if you have a masochistic streak, otherwise, don\u2019t leave your cozy apartment for this. Him calling you ungrateful is just the chef kiss of entitlement.

If you break up, he would keep all the equity and you wouldn't. May as well stay in your apartment. He made the choice, not you. There's consequences to every action; good or bad. It's not being ungrateful. Especially if it was something you had no input in.\n\nBut you TA for trying to tell him who he may or may not have as a room mate.", "NTA you could end up paying for half of the house when owning none of it. I think your view of around 700 is correct for your share of the bills plus a little rent is the fair amount. He shouldn't have bought the house just expecting you to pay for half of it.", "NTA. Your partner is expecting you to pay half his mortgage without an equal exchange of equity in the home. He is essentially trying to make money off of you. \n\nIf he isn\u2019t planning to get you to sign a rental agreement, he also would likely be able to get away with not claiming the money you pay as rental income. Meaning he would get the tax deduction for the mortgage without having to pay any tax on the income (your rent). \n\nEven if you sign a rental agreement, he\u2019s still making money off you, just not as much. I wouldn\u2019t move in with him without an agreement stating that I get equity in the home with every mortgage payment I contribute to.", "NTA. He's allowed to charge his tenants what he wants, you're not obliged to become his tenant. You two aren't married or cohabitating so using the \"our house\" card doesn't really work.", "This is shady. Stay in your apartment.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He is trying to get you to pay half of his mortgage. If he has to get roommates in order to afford his own place then he is living above his means. Stay where you are paying $700 and take a hard look at the relationship you\u2019re in.", "If he bought the house with the idea that it would be for both of you to live in, then you should have been more involved in the decision making process especially with regards to finance. As you\u2019ve said in a comment, you have only been together for a year. To me, for him to buy a house on his own but expect you to act like you both have equal claim on it is wrong. It feels like too much of a financial imbalance if you want this to be a long term relationship. He holds the full title to the house, but expects you to contribute towards it equally? I believe in people contributing equally to a house if you are both living in it. But, when you bring in the fact that you would be paying half of his mortgage but wouldn\u2019t own half of the house, that makes me uncomfortable.", "NTA. He bought the house expecting you to pay half without telling you so he wouldn\u2019t have to have roommates. Sounds a little fishy. Why would you want to pay more for somewhere to live?", "NTA, if you break up what do you get for paying down his mortgage. Don\u2019t do it unless your getting something if you break up. I\u2019d stay where you are and save up.", "Nah\n\nIf you don't want to move in fine. But if you don't he can definitely get whatever roommate he wants to help with the mortgage.\n\nDoesn't matter gender", "NTA. You should not pay more than $700 for your share of rent in his house. And since you don't get your own room it should probably be a little less. Hes probably trying to charge you so much because he cant afford it. Which really should have been a conversationbefore he bought the house. Ask him to lower the rent, and also let you pick the other roommates so it can be someone your comfortable with.", "NTA. If you are going to pay half of the mortgage, it\u2019s only fair that you receive 50% ownership as well. If he wants all the benefits of ownership, then he can rent out rooms at the going rate for your area. If you want to take on roommates, how about another couple?", "NTA, he didn't consult you at all and expects you to pay more in living expenses just to move in with him. Stay in your apt and let him get roommates.", "NTA. Don\u2019t get dragged in to an argument about mortgage vs. rent and percentages of this or that. Say that your housing budget is $700 and you\u2019re happy to stay where you are now if that doesn\u2019t work for him.", "NTA but y\u2019all need to communicate on the specifics of what\u2019s expected. Did he buy a townhome he can\u2019t afford without you?", "This is kinda tough, bc you\u2019re NTA for not wanting to pay significantly more than what you\u2019re paying now and sound happy to continue with your current living situations\u2026you would be TA for forbidding him or getting angry if he gets a roommate though", "NTA....why would you move in with him?  It's going to cost you more money and build his equity.  \n\nWhy do men expect women to pay half?  \n\nWomen do not earn as much money as men earn over their lifetime, between pregnancy, taking time off to look after children, caring for sick/elderly relatives etc etc.\n\nWhy has it become okay in society for women to pay 50/50 when women don't earn as much over their earning lifetime?", "It might've behooved you two better to have these financial details hammered out prior to buying a 3 bedroom house.

It\u2019s a free country.", "What makes you think I\u2019m a man?", "yea because he paid for it, why would she get a free house?", "I\u2019m confused. He owns the place so is it a lease agreement between me and him? I guess to", "Exactly my point. \n\nHe wants her to move into a place HE chose and is building equity in, a place where she won\u2019t even have her own room, but wants her to pay $450 more than she currently pays and won\u2019t meet her where she\u2019s at.", "Yeah you're completely right. It doesn't seem like either one asked the important questions when it came to living together.", "Than absolutely NTA. He can't make financial decisions for you and you're under no obligation to move in with him anytime let alone only a year into the relationship. If he really wanted you guys to live together he should have been been including you in the financial discussion to see what you were comfortable with.", "Yeah I'm kind of leaning towards nah. Finances are so personalized. \n\nSome couples split everything 50/50, some do percentages based on income.  Him saying \"the two of us share this place so we should split expenses equally\" is totally fair. \n\nOP saying \"I currently pay $700 for my share of a place, if we move in together I can't afford to pay more than that\" is also fair. \n\nBut even tho neither of you would be at fault, you're still at an impasse and the solution then is probably just that you shouldn't move in together right now.", "Ofcourse it shouldn't be free, but it's not fair to pay half for something he ends up owning", "I guess I got confused too, is it a house? I thought it was an apartment or something you were sharing. If he's sharing the deed of the house with you, then the mortgage is partly your responsibility too.", "Am I missing something with \u201chave your own room\u201d \n\nWhen you move in with a partner you share a bedroom and the entire space. If you\u2019re also splitting hairs about the price per room and mortgage equity with someone you\u2019re in a romantic relationship with, you are not ready to move in with them or really anyone.", "\ud83c\udfc5", "If he wanted her to pay half then he should have included her in the decision of what to buy so she could keep her half within her budget. That's what pushes him into asshole territory for me. He made the choice with no regard for her financial situation and then just arbitrarily decided that she should pay half. Hard disagree. OP is NTA.", "what do you think shes doing now", "If she's not on the deed the mortgage is not her responsibility at all. Just rent.", "He bought a townhouse. I\u2019m currently living in an apartment. I don\u2019t own any part of the house", "Sounds like they aren\u2019t ready to move in, given that she had no say in picking the price of the place.", "Having your own room doesn't have to mean a bedroom. My husband and I share a 3 bedroom house. We share the master bedroom. The second bedroom is his office and mancave, abd the third bedroom has my instruments and a spot to do crafting. So we each have our own space even though we do sleep in the same room.", "Oh okay, NTA then. If youve got your own living arrangement, and he wants to blow money on a 3-bedroom townhouse, then I'd say you don't have any financial obligations to help him. That's a bit weird, sorry for the confusion.", "Agree."]}
