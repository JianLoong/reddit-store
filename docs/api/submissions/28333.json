I\u2019ve haggled while on vacation after researching local customs and it was fine. But, one shop I went into the local seemed to get a little annoyed and said that he doesn\u2019t haggle in his shop. So, cool. I respected that and didn\u2019t haggle. His shop, his rules.

I also found that prices were fairly reasonable and I rarely felt like I was being charged \u201ctourist prices\u201d.
