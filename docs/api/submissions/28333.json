That story is funny, especially where your brother felt victimized.\n\nMost of us realize that out of the country, other cultures haggle over prices, or that prices are marked up when they see a foreign travel roll up into their hometowns. It is just life, but it does not give you the \"right\" to get nasty with someone.\n\nGive your brother a copy of the book *The Ugly American* as a gift sometime.
