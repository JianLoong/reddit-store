Married life with her will be **HELL**.\n\nEven if her love language is \"acts of service,\" she's showing she clearly DGAF how much you have to suffer for it.

I get having a craving, but you're both adults and can go get whatever yourselves.", "NTA. She shouldn't be guilting you into going to get her food.

Next time she can pick it up on her way home if she is feeling like it.\n\nI would honestly consider your engagement carefilly. Does she regularly make demands of you? Or blackmail you be ayse you love her? It is not a good look on her and I woulfng personally marry someone who acted this way. She still has some growing to do. This lady is too young and immature to get married, and if you DO marry her, expect more childishness like this.\n\nI would sit her down and explain that it is not appropriate for her to demand you travel for an hour when there is food closed to home, and when she can also go and get it herself. You are her partner, bot her servant. \n\nI would never demand my fiance goes on a 60 minute journey unnecessarily when there are other options close at hand.

The loving thing for her to do at that time was accept that she will have to readjust what her taste buds are expecting and go with something else, because she doesn't want to suffer the long drive while tired out and doesn't want to put you through it either.", "NTA\u2026being in relationship doesn\u2019t mean being a servant", "NTA.

She\u2019s capable of getting what she wants. You laid a boundary and offered other options.

I love it, too, but not an hours' drive worth.", "Yeah, I'm wondering this too. My emotionally-driven knee-jerk verdict (which I've not actually levied) was Y T A & it's 100% because I'm an act of service type & until I step out of that box my most visceral reaction is \"but you were already going out to get food, why does only your specifically desired food matter? Don't you care?\"\n\nIs the Mac & cheese an hour away, or was the drive past it just an hour ago? I sincerely wasn't able to catch that and I initially read \"an hour ago\" as more along the lines of \"we've been sitting in the house discussing our plans for 30 minutes now\"; I.e. that \"an hour ago\" didn't mean an hour on the road. Surely they don't both commute a full hour every day just to drive home from work...? That seems excessive, even from my perspective (i.e. Texan, every major city in the state is at least three hours from the next major city, etc.)", "It\u2019s set more than a year and a half out atm which thankfully gives me time to really evaluate things. She does things for me too, she would give her last dollar and the shirt off her back to the people she cares about.

I casually mentioned I was craving a meatball sub from firehouse and she offered to drive me to go get it.", "She\u2019s had it door-dashed before idk why she couldn\u2019t do it again, honestly I think it was more about having me do it for her.", "Absolutely NTA then. You gave her options (not just basic shitty options but straight up offered to cook for her) and you'd both had long days. She needs to learn to either compromise or look after herself. Please don't think you're the bad person in this situation in any which way", "She should have gotten her own damn Mac and cheese then, if she wanted it so badly. Tell her that if she loved you, she wouldn\u2019t make you go back into town after a long week to get her Mac and cheese after passing the restaurant an hour before. Then, the next time you are at the grocery store buy a bunch of Panera Mac and cheese cups and put them in the freezer. Or you can ask at Panera, because it comes pre portioned in bags that they keep warm until a customer wants some. Ask to buy the bags and stick them in the freezer. My daughter worked there and would sometimes come home with leftover Mac and cheese to put in freezer because they don\u2019t save them and reheat. It would go in trash otherwise.", "She's 22 and not mature enough to get married.  You should really rethink this and definitely not rush.", "OK.  My point still stands though.  Even if it's, say, 25 minutes each way.  \n\nThink long and hard about being with her.  If she loves \"testing\" you this way, which she clearly enjoys, it will be absolute **hell** to marry her.", "That is correct.", "Agreed. People make mistakes with their reactions, especially in times of high stress. It really does not sound like it\u2019s the Mac and cheese, at all. Not saying you should reward her behavior, but knowing she\u2019s going through a rough patch, maybe get her something she enjoys as a surprise? As partners, we always want to be supportive and doing something nice might help her a bit.", "She's being unreasonable. I wouldn't worry too much about it. She'll get over it", "Haha I agree that it\u2019s not worth it. \n\nHmm yeah I\u2019d agree they\u2019d feel incredibly cared for in an emergency situation and wouldn\u2019t specifically ask for that. \n\nI feel that in this situation, OP was already leaving to grab the pizza and even though both parties were exhausted from work, OP had the energy to go back out and when GF asked for Panera and he said no, she felt that she wasn\u2019t worth the 40-60 min drive for food. That being her love language and her hearing I\u2019m not worth the drive. \n\nGranted to she did ignore the effort given by OP to do something else even as far as making box at home\u2026. So GF also just sucks in general and was being whiny", "lol just to comment on the Texas spot\u2026 I drive an hour to and from daily, it\u2019s 30 miles one way but also traffic is just *that bad*\n\nEdit to add: I live in downtown Dallas and commute to Fort Worth", "We both got off work at 5pm and went home. Panera is like a mile away from where we both work and it would have been on the way to pick it up if she decided she wanted it then. She didn\u2019t tell me she wanted Panera until it was about 6pm and we were both at home in the living room discussing what we wanted. By that point I didn\u2019t want to get up and drive right back to town for it as it would have been 15-20 minutes drive each way plus waiting in line to order and get the food.", "They're both being stupidly immature about it. Adults who are about to get married do not get into big ass fucking arguments over this shit.  You talk, come to a compromise or agreement, and you don't come to reddit to whine about how you don't waaaannnnna drive that far and how meeeeean she's being.", "That's important in understanding why she's so upset. She's probably thinking she does things like that for you without even being asked but you won't do the same in return. NAH... I can see both sides. IMO you should let her know you regret not going out to get her Panera and find a way to make it up to her.", "Ew. If it was a small independent restaurant that makes it from scratch, I'd understand but then I'd actually go get it if I wanted it that bad.", "That\u2019s pretty much how she felt about it, you summed it up pretty well. I have gone out much later at night to get things she needed before when she\u2019s sick and try my best to treat her well, I was just especially tired that night and didn\u2019t feel like driving all the way out there and tried to talk her into closer options.", "Alright yeah I was thinking about the hellscape of the DFW region and decided not to acknowledge that exception but you got me there.\n\nI hate being a PASSENGER in the DFW area.", "I appreciate the added context!\n\nTo be honest, I kinda skew YTA, and it mostly comes from my individual perspective on commuting. Please hear me out.\n\nI'm partially sighted, and most of my commuting requires 20-45 minute walks, one way. Because of this, I'm often sincerely baffled when, for example, my students (teach collegiate English) talk about a fifteen minute walk across campus being \"really far,\" as they do when, for example, I send them to our university writing center.\n\nFor me, a 30 minute ROUND TRIP is... a very short trip. Leisurely, even. I accept that for people who are used to commuting by personal car, this may feel longer or less reasonable. For me, though, I couldn't even get to the restaurant across the road and a few blocks down from me in 15 minutes (crosswalk involves going a block and a half in the wrong direction just to cross).\n\n15 minutes to Panera... my feelings might have been kinda hurt, too. My partner and I (she bikes to work) usually walk like 20 minutes one way from work to the nearest food places when we wanna eat together.", "[deleted]", "She has some dietary issues too so it\u2019s hard for her to find things she both likes and can digest without trouble, so I\u2019m not gonna judge her too much for liking their Mac and cheese but I don\u2019t wanna be guilted into getting it for her when there are other options more easily available", "Which is also valid! You can say no and she needs to better understand why you\u2019re saying no and respect that.", "When it\u2019s non peak time, it\u2019s great!! Only about 35mins drive!
