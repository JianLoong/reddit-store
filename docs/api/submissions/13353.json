And your daughter deserves to be protected from disgusting behaviour.", "NTA\n\nI take full-time care of my mother who has Alzheimer's and diabetes. Until her diagnosis, she was a normal, regular person, but since the symptoms have progressed, she gets surly and stubborn and awful to be around. Luckily, racism isn't an issue but she has gone from being my mother to someone I don't get along with and really don't like very much, yet here I am still. Spare your daughter and yourself. Your husband needs to realize that Grandma isn't really Grandma anymore.", "NTA.\n\nDementia patients often become very mean and nasty, which is where it sounds like Grandma is headed. That can be terrifying for a child, and she sure doesn't need any racist BS thrown in on top of that.\n\nLet him visit his grandma as much as he wants, but I'd stay away and keep my child away, too.", "NTA\n\nProtect your kid.  He can visit her all he wants.", "NTA\n\nDementia is very difficult to deal with as a family.  You watch this person you loved change before you into someone else and there is nothing you can do about it.  Support your husband, be there for him, but that does not mean that you have to place yourself or your daughter into a situation where you will be abused.", "NTA.\n\nGrandma may not have been racist when she was lucid. Or if she was, she did an excellent job hiding it.\n\nBut dementia can do terrible things to people - brings out sides of them that they never knew they had, or removes the filters on what they always believed but always kept hidden. It's not necessarily their fault - but it's also not really relevant.\n\nWhether granny is lashing out at you because that's who she's always been, or if it's because the dementia is inserting attitudes her old would never have agreed with, the net result is the same. She says hurtful and racist things. And it's not wrong of you to want to protect your daughter from that, nor is it wrong of you to not want to have to deal with it.\n\nYour husband may struggle with it because he has the memories with her that you don't, but he needs to face the truth that who she is now is not the lady he grew up with.", "NTA at all. Of course you're well within your right to protect yourself and your child. Just because she's \"grandma\" that doesn't mean you have to subject yourselves to her dementia.\n\nThis must be really difficult for your husband too so I hope that he understands your position and I hope you're there to help him through losing her. This could be a very long process, dementia is a difficult way to go.", "NTA. Protecting your six year old is your top priority. That little girl can't fully understand what dementia does to a person nor the history of racism.\nLet your husband visit grandma and let your 6 year old draw pretty pictures to brighten grandma's room.

There's no need to put yourself or your daughter through that. Especially since her negative feelings toward you didn't start with the dementia.", "NTA. Unfortunately, your husband\u2019s grandmother has lost the filter that might have been able to protect your daughter from damaging statements. He might wish she were different, but she\u2019s not. Does he really want to gamble with your daughter\u2019s emotional health and development? And why hasn\u2019t he been protecting you, either?\n\nIf his grandmother were ill with Covid or C-DIFF or measles, and she kept carelessly spreading that contagion, would he force you both to visit, too? Would he insist that she used to be healthy, so it\u2019s fine?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to say what is or is not offensive. He hasn\u2019t been the target. You have.

Your husband is the a-hole for not being willing to understand why his daughter should come before his racist grandma though.", "My friend and I both have discussed how horrified we would be if this came out if we had dementia. We acknowledge as white people from America growing up in the 50s and 60s, we have all these ideas and words in our head. As rational people, who don't want to act/be racist, we can police ourselves and get to where words and thoughts don't even come up any more. \nBut dementia takes that away, it removes connections, it leaves only that which is oldest behind (in many cases). So when my friend did develop dementia, I pre-apologized to the staff where he lives now on his behalf because that's what he would have wanted. Luckily it's not been much, but some words are there and they come out of his mouth (not as an meant to be an insult, but just as a word for a person, the way they were used around us as kids) and of course it is an insult and worse. Gah, nurses and doctors who deal with dementia have to listen and deal with so much - it's such a hard job.\nBut NTA because you and your kid do NOT have to deal with this.", "NTA Protect yourself and your child at all costs!

She\u2019s from Brazil. My children don\u2019t speak Portuguese. But we had an incident where she was holding into my son (8?) and swinging him side to side and singing Portuguese LOUD to him. I\u2019m always the \u201cif they don\u2019t want to hug don\u2019t make them mom\u201d.  This traumatized my son for a couple of years. It was aggressive and loud and he tried really hard to keep cool. But he wouldn\u2019t go near here for AWHILE after that. Like until he was 12 and she was on her death bed. Don\u2019t traumatize your kid like that. It isn\u2019t fair to them. And your man needs to respect that.", "Interesting.", "My sister refers to my mom acting this way: \"she is living with a giant toddler\".

To be fair to him I don't know if she was putting on a good show in front of us, but she was always the very tut tut, passive aggressive sort of person - this is not a side of her I've seen, all conspiratorial and accusative and just weird.", "It\u2019s not even the worst of it, sadly. Dementia is absolutely brutal.", "No. Just no. \n\nGrandma is polite when she's lucid and can keep the racist comments in check. In her non-lucid moments, she's unguarded and is getting more hateful. Your husband should easily understand why you refuse to subject your daughter to that. She shouldn't have to understand that at 6. Even if the dementia is bringing it out more.\n\nYou didn't tell him he couldn't go. Just that he's going without the 2 of you.", "Especially since it's like... the lucid moments, the moments where she has control? Those are just going to get fewer and farther between as her dementia progresses. He knows that, right OP?"]}
