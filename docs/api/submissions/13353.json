Until her diagnosis, she was a normal, regular person, but since the symptoms have progressed, she gets surly and stubborn and awful to be around. Luckily, racism isn't an issue but she has gone from being my mother to someone I don't get along with and really don't like very much, yet here I am still. Spare your daughter and yourself. Your husband needs to realize that Grandma isn't really Grandma anymore.", "NTA.\n\nDementia patients often become very mean and nasty, which is where it sounds like Grandma is headed.

He can visit her all he wants.", "NTA\n\nDementia is very difficult to deal with as a family.

Or if she was, she did an excellent job hiding it.\n\nBut dementia can do terrible things to people - brings out sides of them that they never knew they had, or removes the filters on what they always believed but always kept hidden. It's not necessarily their fault - but it's also not really relevant.\n\nWhether granny is lashing out at you because that's who she's always been, or if it's because the dementia is inserting attitudes her old would never have agreed with, the net result is the same. She says hurtful and racist things. And it's not wrong of you to want to protect your daughter from that, nor is it wrong of you to not want to have to deal with it.\n\nYour husband may struggle with it because he has the memories with her that you don't, but he needs to face the truth that who she is now is not the lady he grew up with.", "NTA at all. Of course you're well within your right to protect yourself and your child. Just because she's \"grandma\" that doesn't mean you have to subject yourselves to her dementia.\n\nThis must be really difficult for your husband too so I hope that he understands your position and I hope you're there to help him through losing her.

And why hasn\u2019t he been protecting you, either?\n\nIf his grandmother were ill with Covid or C-DIFF or measles, and she kept carelessly spreading that contagion, would he force you both to visit, too?

We acknowledge as white people from America growing up in the 50s and 60s, we have all these ideas and words in our head. As rational people, who don't want to act/be racist, we can police ourselves and get to where words and thoughts don't even come up any more. \nBut dementia takes that away, it removes connections, it leaves only that which is oldest behind (in many cases). So when my friend did develop dementia, I pre-apologized to the staff where he lives now on his behalf because that's what he would have wanted. Luckily it's not been much, but some words are there and they come out of his mouth (not as an meant to be an insult, but just as a word for a person, the way they were used around us as kids) and of course it is an insult and worse.

She\u2019s from Brazil. My children don\u2019t speak Portuguese. But we had an incident where she was holding into my son (8?) and swinging him side to side and singing Portuguese LOUD to him. I\u2019m always the \u201cif they don\u2019t want to hug don\u2019t make them mom\u201d.  This traumatized my son for a couple of years.

Good Christian man you are why does that offend you? He sputtered. I knew what I was as doing.
