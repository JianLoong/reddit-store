You communicated and showed your distaste for the situation like you should. However it would have shown a bit of class if you just had an \u201cI told you so moment and cleaned the place with her. You\u2019re supposed to be building up your relationship and at times you should still show your love for your gf even when you\u2019re mad. Perhaps a cool off period at the bar and then a helping hand to get the point across and keep things civil. I think the BIGGEST question is, can you accept your gfs unbalanced relationship with her sister? Is this a deal breaker? Is this just more problems down the line? Or do you have the ability to make this a part of your life in peace?", "INFO: The lack of consideration you noted was that these fools expected you to pay for them all the time, but were there any previous instances where you or she would have seen them be slobs or destructive to a home?", "INFO:-\n\nFirstly, I will say, I don't think you were an AH for not wanting to have to deal with the mess created by the guests your girlfriend invited, whom you were more than reluctant to have stay. However, I do think telling her to clean it herself and going to a bar was AH behaviour.  I think it would probably had been better if you'd said to your girlfriend 'lets both go to a bar and you/we can call your sister to tell her to clean the mess they made or that she'll be paying a cleaning company's bill'.\n\nHowever, I am intrigued by you warning your girlfriend it wasn't a good idea. Up to that point, you've only commented on them letting you pay for everything, and her sister and sister's boyfriend being inconsiderate fools. \n\nWhen you told your girlfriend it wasn't a good idea, what was your fear would happen? Did you think the worst which might happen would be they'd eat all your food and not replace anything? Or did you - and therefore did your girlfriend - have cause to suspect that they wouldn't clean up after themselves and/or damage might be done? \n\nBasically, what I'm asking is, when your girlfriend assured you nothing would happen, was she ignoring a known history of her guests' behaviour, or was she completely blindsided by the mess that had been done to her home?", "Yep YTA, although you didn\u2019t want them stay, it wasn\u2019t your gf who made the mess. You just told her to clean it and walked out, that not just an AH but a completely childish one.", "YTA, because you agreed they could stay. Even if it was against your best judgement, you agreed. You guys should tackle this as the team and you'll both learn something.", "YTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d anyone do anything in a respectful relationship.\n\nAlso, you can tell her \u201ctold you so\u201d, but you don\u2019t go to the fucking bar while she\u2019s cleaning up. Bad look, dude.", "Only AH here is your \"in laws\". You yourself say your girlfriend is considerate, i'm assuming she might have history of giving people the benefit of the doubt with that piece of backstory.\n\nI agree she should probably have said no, but I'm not going to over-simplify familial relations. I don't think it's bad for you to not clean it, but i do think you were mean to her when this could've been a situation to have a serious talk about not letting her sister into your home/maybe lives. I'm sure she's not happy about the situation either.\n\nIt's an emotionally charged situation, and i don't think stepping away to calm down and think is bad. But from what you wrote it seems like you were just rude to your partner and then left, not communicating your need for space at all. This, again, i wouldn't say makes you an AH but both you and your partner have a lot of room for improvement. Cause you'll never have a successful, happy relationship if you can't have a calm conversation when things like this happen about what steps need to be taken to prevent it in the future.\n\nYou seem like a sweet guy, she seems like a sweet girl. It's a shitty situation, and her sisters family are massive AHs. I don't think leaving her without proper communication was right, and i don't think her kindness and consideration extending to people who don't deserve it is right. I hope you can have a genuine conversation about this, hopefully both apologize, and work as a united front in the future. \n\nYour partners sister and her family (and your partners friend tbh) are AHs. Between the two of you, I'd have to say NAH", "YTA\n\nYou reluctantly agreed, but still agreed, so you are in this together.\n\nRegardless, isn't supporting your SO even when you are not required to what one is supposed to do as a partner?\n\nBtw even strategically this doesn't make sense.

At the end of the day you both agreed to let her sister stay there. It might have been reluctant but you did cave and say yes.", "If the roles were reversed,  how would you feel?\n\nIf my husband's sister trashed our place.

Nobody should demand anything from anyone.\n\nOP said he thought it was not a good idea (but didnt demand anything), GF invited her family over, turned out it was not a good idea, now either GF has to clean or call her sister to make her clean it. Both very logical things. OP does not get to 'demand' anything, but is in his full right to leave.\n\nPlease never demand anything from anyone (ok maybe the GF can demand her sister to ccome back and clean.

From the fact that the gf complained to her friend about OP instead of her sister shows that she likely wouldn't have backed down. Meaning OP would have had to issue an ultimatum to get her to agree.

I\u2019m going based on what he said he felt, said, and did. His feeling are valid, he\u2019s entitled to feel whatever he wants. I agree with his thoughts and feelings. I disagree with his actions. A good partner would stick with their gf/bf. Helped fix up their home. Made decisions together so that they never get taken advantage by anyone again.
