She also left one of my pens uncapped on my desk, but she said sorry and promised she\u2019d remember next time. She said it like that fixed it, which is why it pushed me over the edge. I said it sucked she didn't care, then asked her to help revive the pen but she refused. I called her inconsiderate and selfish; she stayed calm, the entire time talking over me by saying \u201cit was a mistake\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s just paper\u201d, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d, \u201cwhy are you fighting me over a notebook?\u201d Eventually the fight burned out, I apologized for insulting her and losing my temper. She accepted my apology. \n\nThe next day she borrowed one of my pricier pens and left it on the counter uncapped. I asked her \u201cCouldn\u2019t you go 24 hours without ruining one of my pens?\u201d She said \u201cit\u2019ll take time for me to break the habit, I\u2019m trying but you need to too\u201d.

Silk is expensive so you generally want to avoid that. \n\nThe major difference between yarn and fabric is a flat object vs a round one, so since all scissors eventually dull the yarn will wear the scissors differently than fabric will, and so will paper. I also use a lot more acrylic yarn which can be very rough in general.

Since there aren't any near you, it might be worth it to invest in some whetstones.

Like she's an adult and she knows how she treats things, to deliberately and consistently do that to someone else's possessions is borderline abusive, if not outright so. She knows that these are important to OP, because of medical reasons no less,  something that cuass him pain(!), yet continues? That along with her lack of respect for OP's time tell me she has no respect in general for him.\n\nThis is a \"the problem isn't the Iranian yogurt\" situation, it's that she doesn't give a shit about her husband one.", "Same, I actually have a drawer full of cheap pens because I can not be trusted with pens. I have 3 in my back pocket right now. I prefer nicer pens, but I need regular access to pens and lose too many to spend real money on them.", "Is it weaponised incompetence? As I understand it, that means deliberately doing a task badly so you won\u2019t be asked to do it again.\n\nUnless OPs wife is trying to get out of writing in general by ruining pens, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case here.\n\nI actually think this is worse. Weaponised incompetence is absolutely unacceptable, but it comes from a place of laziness. OPs wife\u2019s behaviour is coming from malice. She is deliberately provoking him and trying to hurt him, also physically, given that using ordinary pens gives him physical pain.", "He sounds awful. Lock them up. He's being a lazy asshole with no respect for your belongings.", "SERIOUSLY.\n\nI have a similar issue to OP: due to a physical issue, when I write for long periods of time I need to use really specific pens or else I'm in a lot of pain, and then literally can't complete my work.\n\nI freaking hide my pens, bc it is *so* hard to find and purchase pens that actually work, and if someone casually uses them I can feel myself morphing into a wolverine.\n\nThis is so pointlessly cruel of your wife, OP.   I have ADHD and I'm sorry but calling constantly using your partners' very specific items an ADHD issue??? Piffle.  If she can't address her supposedly uncontrollable issue on her own, then you have every right to 'address' it by locking your things away.\n\nBut I don't think it's an ADHD issue. I think it's a \"she doesn't like you trying to have boundaries\" issue.", "Oh my God, that would infuriate me.", "My mom replaced her fabric scissors a few years ago and I have her old one. I don't use it a lot and only on fabric and they're there in case she ever wants them back.\n\nMy boyfriend knows not to touch them because \"my mom has a pair of scissors like that too and I know how important those are\". I don't know for sure but I have a feeling every person with fabric scissors threatens people about and with them, lol", "There are 4 people in my office, and we are INTENSE about our pens. Lord forbid one go missing, lol.", "I can lose a pair of scissors or crochet hook sitting on the  sofa not moving, I also take my knitting everywhere with me. So I've made up a travel keyring with scissors, hooks sewing up needles and tape measure. It lives on a lanyard attached to the light next to me or  on my knitting bag when I leave the house. I'm currently the least annoyed at myself I've been for years", "Yup. These are for fine fabrics. These are for heavy fabrics. These are for thread. These are for yarn. These are for embroidery. And so on. That multipack I mentioned are thread snips, because those are great for lots of fiddly things.", ">I'm currently the least annoyed at myself I've been for years \n\nThat's an achievement, haha! \n\nOh, truly, I have a little kit. Actually, a few little kits because I am multi-craftual and, like you, I take projects on the go because my hands always need a job.  But I still lose things. Yesterday it was my \"good\" hammer and my favorite thimble (found both). Today it was my phone, my glass of tea, the pack of refill hacksaw blades, and yet another small pair of thread snips I've been using on a needlepoint project.  I'm not sure I've ever crocheted without losing a hook or two, which is why I have a bajillion of them in my favorite sizes. They always turn up after I've grabbed a replacement.", "I have a cutting room and two sewing stations (industrial and domestic). Each has rotary, snips, regular, heavy duty, and utility scissors (and seam rippers). And that's not including the kitchen, bathroom, and entry.  \n\nSnips though...they do so much.", "I don\u2019t even work in nursing but I\u2019m gonna do this because I\u2019m constantly losing my favourite pen to my coworkers!
