This has gone beyond the pens and paper and is about the relationship. Wife is not caring about the husband\u2019s physical discomfort and personal feelings. Husband is NTA. He should have a deeper conversation with is wife about her disregard for him.", "NTA and i feel like everyone is blowing past the fact that you have these specific items because of a medical issue and that you use these things because they reduce the amount of pain you have to be in. have you explicitly stated this to your wife because if she still doesn\u2019t care then that\u2019s even more messed up", "NTA.\n\nMy house has seperate desks, pens, and notebooks. We don\u2019t share. We don\u2019t use each other\u2019s stuff without asking.\n\nBuy her a metric ton of various pens and stationary pads, put them all over the house in her common-use spots, put a chunk in storage for when she loses them, and then put your stuff in a pleasant-looking box with a lid.\n\nAnd then explain you do not want to share your paper and pens. You like them, they\u2019re expensive and fancy, and if she touches them without asking *and you saying yes*  it will be a massive problem. \n\nYou get to have things you use and enjoy, just for yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re married. You\u2019re an adult man, you\u2019re allowed to have one damn pen to call your own. \n\nThis is no longer about a pen. It\u2019s about your wife destroying things you need and enjoy, repeatedly, and dismissing you.", "NTA I collect fountain pens. It sounds like that\u2019s what you use too. Fountain pens should only ever be used by one person, as the writing shapes the nib over time. I personally would be livid if someone else was using my fountain pens. Everyone in my house knows not to use them, and heaven help anyone that touches my wooden foundation pen my son\u2019s father gave me for Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s my favorite.", "While I do agree about the value of the tools to the artist/craftsperson (artist myself), the issue isn't about the pens directly so much as it is that the wife is not respecting OPs boundaries. Once or twice is an accident. Happening repeatedly, and with the types of responses wife is giving when called out on it, is on purpose.", "Yeah, OP is NTA here.\n\nI sew and craft. I have made people buy me new scissors when they used my fabric scissors on paper. The only way people like this learn to stop is when they have to pay $30-$50 to replace a tool they assumed only cost $5. \n\nAt this point locking them up is the only way to make sure they don't get used. It doesn't matter that OP needs them because of physical issue. OP has asked the wife to not use them. Someone who was considerate and respected your things would have stopped using them immediately.", "NTA. I don\u2019t mess with my wife\u2019s craft tools / writing implements unless she tells me to get them for her. I\u2019m clumsy and they\u2019re wasted on me. The nice thing is it\u2019s never my fault when it\u2019s misplaced.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 You put some stuff on the coffee table while you were cleaning your desk\u2026\u201d She finds it gives me a hug and goes on her merry way.", "I often misplace my favorite scissors and it annoys me to no end.", "I\u2019m also wondering why she gets so pissed he locked his stuff up when, she just forgets/ won\u2019t do it again. OP made it pretty clear that they have communal pens and paper around the house, so if his is locked up why can she just use the other stuff? Aside from being really disrespectful whe he asked her not to use it, it seems like she might be going out of her way to use it. I could believe her \u201cbeing forgetful\u201d and using it when it\u2019s right there and she just grabs it, but then why is she so upset when it\u2019s suddenly unavailable and other pens and paper are?", "Exactly! Having ADHD can make you inattentive, it does not make you willfully destructive and uncaring. If ADHD were really to blame, wife would be more apologetic or at least attempting to come up with suggestions. \n\nI had pretty intense (unmedicated) ADHD as a kid. I used my mom\u2019s fabric scissors on paper exactly one time. Sometimes, my crafts got derailed and I had to tear things if I couldn\u2019t find paper scissors, but I never used the fabric scissors next to me because I understood they were important to my mom, would be dulled if I used them - (and she would definitely find out). If a child with ADHD can figure it out, a full grown adult woman should be able to as well. The wife is making deliberate choices to treat her partner\u2019s things badly. \n\nNTA", "This isn't gaslighting. Gaslighting requires trying to lie and twist the situation so you doubt your own reality.\n\nShe hasn't tried to do that. She's just dismissing OP for caring about pens and notebooks.\n\nOP is NTA, but the wife is not gaslighting in any stretch.", "He did this and she\u2019s still mad. I don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s even using the paper for? I mean I like using paper and pens for writing, but I buy my own and they\u2019re not \u201cspecial\u201d. \nWhat is she using it for? I don\u2019t get what her damage is? Is she jotting down notes? Has she never heard of post it? \n\nI would buy her a thing that clips to her and attaches to a retractable pen that\u2019s all hers. They have \u2018em for lighters, they have to have them for pens.", "*Maybe if you didn't keep doing it repeatedly...*", "I am afraid to click on that link...", "Are you actually fucking kidding me???\nSo he should put in so much effort and mental capacity and spend money on her so she will maybe show him the basic respect and consideration he deserves as a partner?? Get her extras???? Wtf", "I would, and I eventually transfer over, but writing on paper first helps me focus. Habit from before the pain became too bad, I guess.", "I feel like I've seen that before... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ1pO-tZbYA", "It\u2019s more the pens that help the pain rather than the paper, though the paper means there\u2019s less smearing. I have madelung\u2019s deformity, which also impacts how my wrist moves, so your mileage may vary. \r  \n\r  \nSome of the few I have in my collection that are the most comfortable for me are Edison Collier fountain pens, or a couple Arlingtons by River City pen company. The shape and the weight of them help when my wrist pain is flaring up. \r  \n\r  \nAs for paper, I\u2019m very partial to Clairefontaine wire bound A5 wire bound notebooks, Doane paper grid+lines writing pads. Less bleed through on the Clairefontaine, the Doane pads are one sided.", "The wife is in fact the \u201clow cost tool\u201d in this story.", "My daughter's ex-husband used her big fabric shears to cut fiberglass insulation. Because \"it's cloth isn't it?\" (NO!) She told him that if he touched her scissors again, he wouldn't have to hunt for them a third time, because he would find them sticking out of his chest.", "Isn't she twisting it though? From the quotes I definitely took it as her switching gears as it suited her - she forgot, she needs time, they're not that important any way. It's more than just dismissal", "Oh hell no. Your notebook should be your space", "Why bony just get a divorce", "It's  a perfectly cromulent link.", "Makes sense!", "I mean, I buy a specific pen & refills for work (Pilot G2). They cost little to nothing, but it still infuriates me when someone 'borrows' it.", "Lol is that why he's an ex?\n\nI had people use my fabric scissors at my old work to cut plastic and I didn't bother to keep in touch with them when I left, I wonder why", "Yep, my dad would always use my fabric scissors on paper, no matter how much I would remind him.  Funny enough, he doesn't touch the purple ones I have now.", "My coworkers kept stealing my scissors that came out of the office closet (probably because someone took theirs). So I bought a bright purple pair at the dollar store. No one can say that they didn't realize they had picked up my scissors anymore.", "Gaslighting would be \u201cno, I didn\u2019t use your pen, you\u2019re the one that left the cap off. We\u2019ve never discussed your stationary before, you can\u2019t expect me to read your mind.\u201d It\u2019s not just arguing to suit yourself, it\u2019s purposely trying to confuse the victim\u2019s sense of reality or knowledge of events.", "She could be twisting it in certain ways, but it's still in no way gaslighting.\n\nA good example of gaslighting is like... I do something that you know is fucked up, but some how convince you that it is either not that fucked up, or that you did it.\n\nA good example is an abusive spouse convincing THEY are the reason it happens.\n\nLike YOU got abused because of YOU and YOU are the problem, not them.", "The office is down the hall from the bedroom and away from the living room and dining room areas.", "She was medicated years ago but not anytime recently. Also not in therapy. That is another ongoing discussion but I understand I don\u2019t have the right to keep pushing her to either one when it\u2019s not impacting her work or school, when it\u2019s \u2019just me\u2019 that has issues with her. In her words, it\u2019s a personal problem of mine how I react to her behavior when it\u2019s not causing issues.", "Those pens are popular at my work but I use a specific width one (standard is 0.7mm wide, I use 0.38mm) because I have incredibly small handwriting and it's more legible with thinner pens\n\nIt's hard to hunt them down at the store sometimes so I've startled more than a few coworkers with how intense I am with getting the damn things back", "I just bought a metal G2.  I love that thing.  Nobody, but nobody, gets to borrow it.", "My Weiss are in the drawer with the sewing supplies, you have to hunt to find them, while I have general purpose ones all over the house in every pen jar and knife block and everything/junk drawer - lol!", "So if she was telling him she used them because he left them out? Or she wouldn't use them if he put them away properly/had access to other pens/ just did (X)? Would that be gaslighting?\n\nWould her telling him it's not that important anyway not come under this definition?", "NTA and if the items are so far out of the way, I feel she's purposely doing this now. You locking up the items should help her break the habit. You could put a few \"regular\" pens and paper in the office where the previous ones have been. \n\nKeep yours locked up. If she still has a problem, there's a bigger issue here.", "What the actual fuck? That's such a selfish thing to say and I take back any benefit of the doubt towards her. She knows ADHD is causing issues with her relationship and tells you she doesn't care enough about you to do anything? Fuck that's selfish. ADHD may be the reason for her issues, but it is not an excuse. I also highly doubt she doesn't have any issues with school or work.\n\nHave you tried reframing her words back to her? Like pointing out that her saying it's your problem is her admitting she does not care about you? If she did care about her partner, she would put in the effort to sort her shit out.", "I have ADHD, but I still understand and respect personal property. It\u2019s still an important thing to have, even when you\u2019re married or living with family. Some things are communal, some aren\u2019t. The pens and paper are *your* things, belonging to *you* as an individual. The fact she refuses to respect that is the real issue and something she needs to address in therapy. \n\nNTA. I\u2019m also persnickety about my pens, so I get where you\u2019re coming from. There are other writing instruments in the house she can use or she can pick some up at pretty much any store. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re banning any other pens in the house. She just wants yours. You probably have more insight re: why she\u2019s like this, but she needs to realize this isn\u2019t kindergarten. You don\u2019t have to share if you don\u2019t want to.", "You do have a right to reevaluate staying married to someone who doesn't care about you or the relationship enough to take responsibility for her own issues.", "WTF! Causing problems in her relationships should be placed at the top of the list. Issues in work and school can affect you financially, but she should still care more about how her actions affect those she theoretically loves the most. She\u2019s telling you that you\u2019re not important to her and she won\u2019t do the smallest thing (use her own pen) to not cause you pain (literal physical wrist pain), discomfort, inconvenience, lost time, or extra costs. Either she\u2019s not a good person, or she doesn\u2019t really care about you. This is not ADHD\u2019s fault.", "I'm a nurse and I will actively call out or chase people down if they don't immediately return my pen. And I'm not even talking fancy or expensive pens, just your standard 4 colour pen. I need it for work so don't steal it", "I'm writing all day. Nothing big, just initials for the most part during audits, but I cannot abide by a pen that sucks. G2s never skip, glide just right, and the ink dries quickly.\n\nPilot, if you need a sales rep...", "I'm more blown away by her choosing to leave it untreated because her husband is the only one it impacts. To me that's the same as saying she does not actually care about him.", "I know if I was in the wife's situation, I would never tell my partner to just deal with it.
