At least she's trying and you are also trying and imo that says nice things about both of you.", "NTA at all.\nFountain pens are a joy to use if used and cared for correctly, and a very expensive pain in the ass if neglected.\n\nIf she's actually just looking for any pen and paper at your desk, a box of cheap pens or pencils and a stack of cheap paper at your desk will be able to satisfy her needs.\n\nHowever, this solution will only work if you're willing to look over her blatant disrespect for your stuff.\n\nAnd if she continues using your fountain pens and expensive stationary even with cheap materials at your desk, you know for sure she's doing it on purpose.", "NTA. I feel this is more than a bad habit. She's going out of her way to specifically use your stuff. Thats sabotage really.\n\nLock it up. Its the only thing that will protect your stuff. Get a small lock box", "NTA. Wife is.", "NTA and I think she\u2019s doing it on purpose as some kind of bizarre revenge or power play", "I would honestly hide my pens and stationery, putting them in a location that is either unusual for her to get into or difficult in a sense of like on top of the fridge instead of on the writing desk\u2026 There isn\u2019t anything that you need to do. She is consistently wrecking your property, the pens being ruined, not replacing read more pricey supplies. Instead of expecting her to change, just remove the negative stimulus. She\u2019ll only have yucky pens to ruin.\n\nNTA she\u2019s being inconsiderate", "NTA!!! \nshe\u2019s deeply disrespectful and obviously doesn\u2019t care how you feel. How awful.\nIf it were me, I would put the pens & stationary out of her view, as least to mitigate her using them.", "NTA, but honestly just buy a dozen or two bics and place them in a mug on the counter where people will stop at the closest functional writing utensil and not continue walking to your office.", "NTA. Just tell her that you\u2019re helping her break the habit by removing the objects in question. She\u2019s being an inconsiderate jerk face by making what appears to be very little effort to change and demonstrating that she doesn\u2019t take any of this seriously with her arguments, and you\u2019re working on not calling her a jerk when she\u2019s acting like one. So everyone\u2019s working on stuff.", "NTA and you found your solution!   \nAnd if it is \"her stuff, too\" then she can reorder and pay for the stationary and pens...otherwise, stay out of it.", "NTA. Your wife doesn't respect that those items are yours and precious to you. Lock up anything you don't want her to ruin.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to try a LOT harder or you need a locked desk box to keep your stuff in (and for her to accept that this is necessary because of her own inability to respect your stuff)", "Does she leave the lids off the toothpaste and food containers too? This sounds like it is targeted at annoying you. As a stationery addict myself I would be so angry if someone did this to me. If it's 'her stuff too' she surely wouldn't object to buying replacements for all the pens she's ruined. NTA.", "Get a box with a lock for your pens and stationary.", "Nta.  It's not that hard to not touch a person's things.", "NTA. If your wife considers the pens and paper to be too trivial to argue over, are they not also too trivial for her to insist on using whenever and however she wants? Married or not, it is YOUR stuff. Perhaps I'm a jerk, but no one touches anything on my desk or my craft supplies. Period. I try to be nice about it, but I am very particular about where my stuff is and how it's used. Once I've told someone not to use those items, I expect them to respect me enough to ask and to accept no if it's something I don't want to share. I respect their belongings as well and have often bought duplicates of items my family wants to use because I know my behavior is odd and somewhat selfish.", "Hide your pens in a secret drawer and leave a decoy pen out", "Get a nice wooden box that works for your stationary drawer and don't give her a key.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t attempt to respect your boundaries. Pens still uncapped. Paper used up. Getting into your things, and saying that since you\u2019re married, they\u2019re hers anyway. Talking over you. Being dismissive.\n\nLock up your stationary. It\u2019s not ridiculous.", "NTA - I would've locked my desk long ago.  Honestly this would drive me up the wall. I noticed you apologized but your wife didn't.  Don't apologize for locking the desk.", "Tangential but what stationery do you use? I also have wrist pain and I\u2019ve never heard of using a specific kind of paper for coping with it.", "NTA. Maybe it is \u201cjust a pen,\u201d but it\u2019s important to you and she should care how she treats her spouse. She\u2019s being insensitive and uncaring. Lock them up.", "NTA. I'm a stationary junkie, I have certain writing implements I'm willing to loan out and others I absolutely keep to myself unless I've got more than one.", "NTA\n\nShe knows exactly what she's doing\n\nkeep them locked away and have the key with you at all time", "NTA. I have ADHD and if my partner told me not to touch something special to him I would respect that. She is being inconsiderate and disrespectful. She can buy her own pens.", "NTA. Ask her if she wants you to trash her makeup. It\u2019s exactly the same thing.", "NTA, and, as someone who owns a $150 fountain pen, you need a locked pen drawer.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nI'm a fountain pen guy, and everyone in my house knows not to screw with my pens, especially since they could be worth anywhere from $30 to $300. I would definitely lose it if someone broke the clip off one of them. \n\nAlso, just out of curiosity, what pens do you use?", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of the items (pens, tools, shoes, favourite towel etc), it's a lack of care and respect for your things and your wishes. Even after you have expressly explained your feelings.", "Oooooo. Absolutely you are NTA. As an avid fountain pen and stationery writer, your wife needs to leave your stationery supplies alone.", "Get a lockbox for your pens. Don't give her the combination. Yes, it's the nuclear option, but **nothing else is working here**. She isn't taking you seriously or respecting your belongings. I have ADHD, I have a habit of destroying the bit that clips to your pocket...I don't use other people's pens. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s also gaslighting you about this, continue to lock the pens and paper away, make sure she doesn\u2019t have a key. Why on earth does she insist on using your stuff?", "NTA. I have special pens that I use for work.  Nobody is allowed to use them. My husband doesn't use my pens and I don't use his either.", "NTA, being married doesn\u2019t mean you have to share every single thing. Your stationary was purchased because you need it and she\u2019s disrespecting it and by association, disrespecting you. The petty person in me says start using her stuff and leaving it all over the place too. Maybe stretch out all her socks and say \u201cwhat\u2019s yours is mine\u201d", "OP's wife is a passive-aggressive AH.", "This right here. I am a crafter with multiple scissors. 99% of those scissors are for crafts *not* nails, paper, zip ties, etc. When my husband and I got married we had a brief conversation about what would happen if I caught him using my good scissors on anything other than craft supplies. He's been respectful and wonderful about it ever since and - if he's concerned - will check with me to be 100% sure that the tool he's grabbed is ok to use. \n\nOP is NTA. And if I was in their shoes, I would have gone off a long time ago. And then hid my (still working) possessions *and* required that my partner pay to replace everything that's ruined.", "And a good partner WILL respect your wishes (if reasonable!) because they CARE ABOUT YOU.\n\n\nFor example, I have very specific snacking habits. I rarely snack, but when I do, I want one specific thing that I probably haven't touched in weeks, sometimes months. My husband knows that, and 1) asks if he can finish something when we go shopping one of the next days and can replace it, and 2) leaves at least one portion of all \"my\" snacks regularly. We didn't need a full-blown fight to establish this, just me stating my needs, him stating his, and us finding a way that works for both of us.\n\n\nIf your partner doesn't WANT to change something that bothers you greatly, do they actually value you as a partner?\n\n\nNTA.", "Such as one would take for adhd, for example.", "OP writes as a hobby.", "yeah, my husband bought me a beautiful $400 fountain pen (a recent Sailor LE) and I would be ***livid*** if someone treated it like your average disposable bic pen they got at a hotel.\n\nAnd that's not even wildly expensive by fountain pen standards...\n\nBut it doesn't really matter for the purposes of this conversation. OP's wife is demonstrating that she doesn't really care how her negligence makes OP feel. It's not really about the stationery, it's about the lack of consideration.", "Seamstresses are notorious about scissors. Every one I\u2019ve met is really nice\u2026but if you touch their scissors, Mr. Hyde comes out ;)\n\nYour comment made me smile.", "My mother told me what she\u2019d do to me if I used her fabric scissors on anything else. She\u2019s been gone nearly 8 years\u2026but I still won\u2019t!", "My dad hated (correctly) that the entire family would borrow & misplace his good office scissors, and then deny it. Eventually he bought a multicolored pair and wrote MINE on the blades. They were not the\"manliest\" scissors, but it was really hard to claim that borrowing them was an accident.", "Interesting she is still pissed...\n\nShe needed understanding and time to change her habit. But locking them away just helps her with that. \n\nIs she going out of her way to get pens from your desk? Is it a separate office or a communal area?", ">Problem solved\n\nDon't be shocked when you come home one day and she \"forgot\" and picked the lock.", "No, understanding of other peoples perpective starts at a age of about 4-6 years, if your toddler can do that before than he is ahead of the curve.", "I would not be calm about this type of disrespect.", "so, you have communal pens and notepads in the plain sight and your wife chooses to write shopping lists in your ideas notebook?!? sorry, but that is just AH behaviour without any excuse\n\nboth me and my partner have out separate hobbies and have never in 10 years deliberately ruined others supplies or handled each other's tools without any consideration\n\nOP you are NTA and your wife needs to start respecting your boundries and stop gaslighting you when you try to enforce them", "First, NTA. Second, as someone with ADHD myself, is she medicated or in therapy for it? Some of her actions do line up with the impulse issues we can face. Another thing, when she says she is trying and will remember, does she make any active steps to ensure that happens? If not, she likely won't remember, our brains really struggle with object permanence. Even if something is extremely important to us, we can still just forget about it. \n\nTrying to downplay the situation could also be her rejection sensitivity and she could be ashamed she forgot again and beating herself up internally. ADHD comes with a LOT of daily struggles, most of which aren't visible or recognized by anyone. Even those closest to us. Most of us are told our entire lives by almost everyone that we are failures because they don't understand our condition.\n\nI think it could be worthwhile to have a calm discussion with her. Ask her point blank if she is struggling with her ADHD and if she is, emphasize you love her and are her partner and to let you in so you can help.\n\nEta: While these are possible reasons for her actions, it does not excuse them. Especially her downplaying how it affects you.", "My mom did something similar. She attached some yarn to the finger holes of the  \"safe-to-use-on-anything\" scissors.
