It\u2019s a combination I\u2019ve narrowed down over years that helps me write more legibly quickly and comfortably. (Congenital defect in my wrists causes pain and stiffness). \n\nMy wife on the other hand uses just about anything. She also has a habit of being absent minded with stationery. She\u2019ll use my pen then leave it uncapped (it\u2019s a style that dries out when uncapped and needs a bit of work to revive it) or she won\u2019t realize she\u2019s bending the nib or snapping off the clip (her ADHD makes her fidget). When she borrows mine she often forgets to put it back on my desk so I have to look all around the house, especially in the communal pens cup. Sometimes after writing one thing and setting it down, she forgets that she already grabbed one so she\u2019ll go and grab another. When it comes to paper, she\u2019ll rip off multiple sheets at a time when she\u2019s \u201cborrowing\u201d it, but then not use all of them. The loose leaf sheets end up in the trash or just plain lost. \n\nI\u2019ve reminded her constantly that the stationery I use is pricy (at least pricier than what she uses) and bought because of my issues handwriting. I\u2019ve tried asking her to take only what she needs or to ask me first or to remember to cap my pens after using them. This is an ongoing tension.\n\nOur 2nd most recent fight came because I went to write and had only a few clean sheets left, but she\u2019d written on two of them. She didn\u2019t even use all of each page, if she had then she could have used just one. She also left one of my pens uncapped on my desk, but she said sorry and promised she\u2019d remember next time. She said it like that fixed it, which is why it pushed me over the edge. I said it sucked she didn't care, then asked her to help revive the pen but she refused. I called her inconsiderate and selfish; she stayed calm, the entire time talking over me by saying \u201cit was a mistake\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s just paper\u201d, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d, \u201cwhy are you fighting me over a notebook?\u201d Eventually the fight burned out, I apologized for insulting her and losing my temper. She accepted my apology. \n\nThe next day she borrowed one of my pricier pens and left it on the counter uncapped. I asked her \u201cCouldn\u2019t you go 24 hours without ruining one of my pens?\u201d She said \u201cit\u2019ll take time for me to break the habit, I\u2019m trying but you need to too\u201d. Yet again I told her it doesn\u2019t feel like an accident when it\u2019s all the time but she just kept telling me \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting to something that\u2019s not going to matter in five days\u201d and \u201cjust calm down and think about this\u201d. Even still, I banned her from using my supplies, even locking them in my desk, to which she called me ridiculous and dramatic about her \u201cborrowing\u201d my stuff when we\u2019re married and therefore it\u2019s her stuff too.", "created_utc": 1681574237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12n8qoo/aita_for_banning_my_wife_from_using_my_writing/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally, buying just a crap ton of expensive pens and paper so that you don't have to have this fight anymore might be the price of admission. I doubt that this is the only way she is inconsiderate and dismissive, and the fact she did it again in less than 24 hours makes it seem to me like it's a little bit of a control issue and not a forgetfulness issue. So, if the relationship is awesome except for this pen issue, just buy a whole bunch of the pens and considerate it the price of admission.

My take is that you\u2019re not mad about pens but the dismissal and carelessness that you\u2019re wife is taking for something important to you whether it\u2019s about her being controlling or her just habitually wanting to use your equipment because your stuff is nicer.  \n\nNAH. Honestly I think you should take her to an art equipment or Japanese stationery or calligraphy store (they are so rare so good luck) and get some nice midrange equipment for each of you and both of you. Have her talk to the folks in charge, maybe she\u2019ll come to appreciate the art. Encourage her to find something that makes her handwriting flourish or just feel super nice when she\u2019s writing. If she find something that\u2019s special to her, chances are she\u2019ll want to use it. Make it a quest to find her favorite.
