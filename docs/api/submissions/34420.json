If you're the cosign, you're as on the hook for the car as she is.", "**NTA.** You had a clear agreement that she didn't follow through on. You are under no obligation to continue shelling out money because she is your sister.\n\nThis probably doesn't need to be said, but it wasn't clear to me if you co-signed or not and whether the car payments are being made. Approach with caution on canceling an insurance policy for a car you co-signed on. I always thought co-sign was a bit of a misnomer, if you co-signed you're just as much responsible as she is.", "NTA.  You've been more than generous in allowing her all this time to do what she said that she would.  Just be sure that your name isn't on the car (or on the loan) since, if she gets into an accident, you could be pulled into the legal consequences.", "NTA but you co-signed for the car. If it isn't insured, then the lienholder will put their own physical damage coverage on the vehicle, adding it to your bill for the car. If she doesn't make the payments, guess who is on the hook? Also, if you appear on the State registration, you are subject to State level penalties as well. Possibly even losing your driver's license. \n\nMorally, NTA at all. \n\nFiscally, you're at risk.

But... youre kind of canceling youre own insurance.... you'll be liable since you cosigned so you could be shooting yourself in the foot.", "NTA, cancel it and let her know. You\u2019ve been generous for half a year.", "NTA As long as you spell it out to your sister, you will not be paying the for insurance any longer and she needs to make suitable arrangements to have the car insured.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When i was between the age of 18-21 i never got help financing anything. No one had good enough credit. So when one of my younger sisters became old enough i told her i would co-sign on a car for her under the agreement that within 6 months to a year she would refinance and get everything for it in her name. She has had this car over a year. Well its been 5 months but i gave her the first month free of insurance and she hasnt paid and apparently doesnt plan to her fiance hasnt or wont pay.

You may not be responsible for the insurance. Check your contract with the lienholder and the insurance company. \r  \n\r  \nGenerally, insurance is mandated for a car loan. But the co-signer isn't always responsible for it.\r  \n\r  \nBut if the insurance obligation isn't met, the car will be repossessed. And you and your sister are on the hook for the default. So that puts you between a rock and a hard place. \r  \n\r  \nIf your car is not repossessed, the lienholder may add force-placed coverage to the monthly payment. Repossessed or not, the lienholder will charge penalties for lack of insurance.\r  \n\r  \nThe other problem is that if there's an accident and the car is uninsured. You may or may not be responsible (see your contracts) but again the bank is still owed and the insurance won't be paying out. The car will be repossessed and if it's totaled, ouch! It won't get anything at auction and you're on the hook for the remainder of the note, plus any fees associated (towing, storage, etc.).\r  \n\r  \nDid you sign a contract with your sister that says she'll reimburse the insurance costs? If not. Ouch again. Because you're much less likely to recover those costs.\r  \n\r  \nYou need to ask yourself, what is your sister going to do if you stop the insurance payment? Can she afford the insurance? Will she get the insurance? Doesn't sound like she can transfer the loan to her own name or isn't willing.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, NTA for wanting to do this, but that's not the real concern.", "I'd rethink that.  IF she crashes the car without insurance YOU'RE on the hook for the car loan as a cosigner.", "NTA", "NTA, and you\u2019re doing the right thing to protect yourself, but as others have said you need to be careful and protective about this as a co-signer. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll have any problems with the insurance being cancelled if she doesn\u2019t pay since the car isn\u2019t in your name (as a co-signer you\u2019re just a party to the loan, not the car title), but obviously it\u2019ll hit your credit if she stops paying the car note.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d tell her that the insurance is due soon and you won\u2019t be making another payment under any circumstances, so she\u2019d better take it over or she\u2019s going to be uninsured.", "Give her 30 days to pay up or tell her you will cancel her insurance.  Then do it.  NTA.", "I did co-sign and they are being paid", "OP says they co-signed the auto loan. I think if it's here in the US, that keeping the car insured is part of the loan contract. OP needs to get totally out of the car. Until then, find the least expensive insurance that satisfies the loan. Tell sister she has six months to get the car in her name. She is expected to pay insurance in full starting now. Probably won't work, sadly.", "It really wasnt in the air i just wanted some reassurance basically", "If you did co-sign, then you proably have some kind of responsibility for insurance being paid.  Better check into that before you cancel it.", "You're going to have to be delicate with this whole situation. If they're already skipping on the insurance payments, the last thing you need is to piss them off and have them skip on the note payments. You bascially have no rights to this car but carry all of the fiscal responsibility.", "A quick google indicates that you are wrong if OP isn\u2019t on the title. A co-signer who isn\u2019t on the title is purely on the hook for loan payments and nothing else.", "I don\u2019t think so, it\u2019s the owner and driver who has insurance responsibilities. As a co-signer, she\u2019s just on the hook for the loan but isn\u2019t an owner.", "A co signer of a vehicle loan is on the hook if the payments aren't being made. If there is no insurance on the car and the car gets totaled,the co-signer is on the hook along with the primary buyer to make sure the loan holder gets their money. I found slightly different information, one site said no, two more days yes. I would ask a lawyer and the lienholder to make sure."]}
