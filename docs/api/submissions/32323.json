Your parents are right, you're supposed to not do that as an adult. But given your age it's understandable. They are trying to prepare you for adulthood, I know you hate them right now but you'll need these lessons later, trust me. Life is full of unfairness and if you lose it every time, you won't get anywhere. Your ability to keep it together will make or break your career path later on.

Sorry dude.", "That's awful, I'm so sorry your entire family seems so dismissive of your property and happiness. Your cousin broke something expensive and precious to you\u2014 I bet they'd be acting differently if *their* belongings had been destroyed.\n\nYour cousin is young, but not nearly young enough to claim he didn't know any better. Accidents happen, but this sounds destructive and incredibly careless, and it doesn't sound like you gave him permission to touch your things. 7 year-olds should know to try and be careful.\n\nIt wouldn't be right to verbally abuse him in retaliation, but if all you did was cry... you know you're not the AH here, OP. I would have had a breakdown too. And your cousin needs to learn that upsetting people can be a consequence of his actions.\n\nI know your mom told you to leave it, but it wasn't her property, so I don't think it should be her say. I do think you should approach your cousin's parents and tell them, politely, what happened, down to the fact that it was expensive and difficult to fund. Ideally they'd owe you a replacement, but if they can't afford that, it's their responsibility to make it up to you appropriately. And to reprimand their son for his carelessness. He needs to learn better.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Good luck with everything OP, I hope things get better for you and I'm so sorry about your switch.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. You have every right to be upset, I would be too!", "NTA. Your feelings and you crying on the spot was totally valid. I also have a Switch that I truly treasure because my dad gave it to me, and events like these are the reason why I don\u2019t lend/left my Switch unattended. I would also broke down if the same thing happened to my Switch. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for what happened to your Switch, but hopefully something good happens to you this Christmas (have a new Switch/games).", "Thanks, was just really upset i had noone to vent/rant to so i decided to do it here lol.", "Thank you sm this means alot\u2764\ufe0f", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you so much\u2764\ufe0f"]}
