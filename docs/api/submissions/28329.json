My maternal aunt came to stay with us. While I was out, she switched my mattress with the one in the spare bedroom upstairs, where she was staying. Now, my original mattress was wrecked with busted springs, and it's currently set up upstairs in the spare room, basically beating sleeping on the floor.\n\nI'm a poor student living at home, so I couldn't afford a new mattress. The spare one upstairs rarely gets used, so I couldn't understand why a good mattress should sit unused while I had to sleep on a worn one. I was notified of this swap by a phone call from my mom.\n\nWhen I demanded they be switched back, my family told me to stop making a fuss, claiming I had swapped them without telling them before (which I definitely did not). I refused to return home until the mattresses were switched back.\n\nEventually, my maternal grandfather called to tell me they were being swapped back, and I went home. However, my mom was in a bad way, saying these arguments \"trigger\" her. My aunt walked past me, heading to sleep on the couch in the living room, and said, \"Don't speak to me.\" I am upset that she thought nothing of going into my room and taking these herself.\n\nKeep in mind, the worn mattress was upstairs, but the good one had been on my bed for six months. I live here; she doesn't. The mattress originally belonged to neither of us, but it's more mine than hers. She justified taking it back by saying, \"I always slept on it when I stayed here,\" even though she could easily afford a hotel for one night given her good job until an alternative mattress can be arranged. Also, I have Asperger's and ADHD, and her interference with my bed and space really upset me.\n\nSo, AITA for wanting my mattress back, even though my whole family is giving me the cold shoulder as if I've done something terrible? Additionally, my grandfather offered me his bed for the night to try and keep the peace, an offer which she would've happily seen happen.\n\nUPDATE: I was just informed that the swap was happening, no one asked me at all.\nThe mattress has been in my house for years, and I pay my way to live here. She is a visitor and the mattress has been in my room for 6 months as my bed. \nIm really considering getting a lock on my door as I feel that my bedroom should be my space", "created_utc": 1696547145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170wds6/aita_for_insisting_my_mattress_back_after_my/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or did you ask permission to swap them from whoever did buy it?", "NTA", "NTA, I get why most people are going for ESH because you made a few comments in your story that made you sound a bit entitled OP. However, considering the mattress originally belonged to your late grandmother and your grandfather told you it was fine and you could keep it after you took it( OP said this in a comment), it\u2019s now yours. You also mentioned that you pay to live in your house, so you have every right to be comfortable to live there.", "ESH. It might feel like it\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d mattress but that\u2019s because people have many definitions of \u201cownership.\u201d Some define it as the person who bought it. Some define it as the person who has it. The point is, claiming ownership of objects in a shared home gets complicated unless you want to involve the law. Your aunt might feel it\u2019s \u201cowned\u201d by the family and available for anyone to use, while I\u2019m more on your side in that I think if you\u2019ve laid your body on it for the last 6 months, it\u2019s pretty much \u201cyours\u201d. But that\u2019s not really the problem. The problem is that you feel your space has been invaded, and your aunt feels you are being a poor host/family member. These things can only be solved with open, honest, non-confrontational communication, and like a lot of families sounds like y\u2019all struggle with that. Trying setting boundaries such as if you want something from my room, please talk to me first but be prepared to also have to make compromises because that\u2019s what family members do for each other. And in the meantime, you might try getting an air mattress until you can afford a real one. That\u2019s what I did and once you get used to it, they\u2019re not that bad.", "Buy a new mattress.  This is not worth the aggravation.", "ESH. I do not believe you should have said that to your aunt, since you only heard of her misdeed through word of mouth, and more to the point your mother (the householder) is the one who gave permission by not interfering.\n\nBut for that I would vote differently. I see nothing wrong with your demands.", "YTA, it seems your mom (or other family member) purchased all the mattresses. So none of the mattresses involved are \"yours\".  If you want to be a mattress boss you should do some mattress buying yourself", "I get it...I hate things being done without my permission in my space.  But it sounds like you're laying claim to things that are not absolutely yours to claim.  I'm going to go with ESH.  \n\nYour aunt sucks for just swapping mattresses without discussing it with you, especially a mattress you were actively using.  If you were only mad about that, I'd side with you.  But otherwise, I feel you're on shaky ground.  You're a poor student and maybe get cranky without sleep; I sympathise.  Your rationalizations kind of suck, though.  You didn't buy the mattress.  Strictly speaking, your grandmother bought it and both you and your visiting aunt have equal claim to it.  Your mattress is worn out and you took the one from the guest room.   \n So far so good...it's not actively being used so why not?  But then what did you think guests were going to do?  Sleep on your old mattress which hurts your back and is not fit to sleep on?  So it's fine for them but not for you?  Why, because they can afford a night at at hotel?  You talk about your space and your rights to it but somehow you also seem to think you have rights to things from the rest of the house but no one else does...not even a daughter visiting her father's house...\n\nI hate to break it to you but those of us without Asperger's and ADHD are also upset when our comfy mattresses are replaced with bad ones, LOL.", "ESH\n\nYour family should have replaced the other mattress outright if it was that bad, rather than just letting you swap with the guest room. They sowed the seeds for this situation 6 months ago.\n\nYou may be paying rent to live there and your room is your space. But that doesn't entitle you to throw a fuss and refuse to come home until your demands are met. And your \"I live here, she doesn't and she can just stay elsewhere\" comment doesn't matter when you are NOT the homeowner. That would presumably be either your mom or grandpa. You can offer input on who stays as a guest but ultimately, it's really their call.\n\nYour aunt is being awful because she's pissed and her sleeping arrangements have been thrown out of whack. And because your attitude sounds a bit exhausting.", "YTA  It's your parents' mattress, and you could have put up with the shitty one for a few days during her visit.", "U are 21 , give the good mattress to upstairs and buy new one for yourself", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
