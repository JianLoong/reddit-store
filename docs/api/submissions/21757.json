Doesn't matter if you are, but if not then that could be why you're are selling better - no one wants what she has on offer.\n\nIf it's similar then obviously you are managing the marketing and have the pricing better than her, she is in control of both of them for her own business and if they aren't successful it's down to her.\n\nIf your records are witting the first page of search results - well there's plenty of space for others there as well if they have their keywords set up correctly for the search results.", "She\u2019s 100% TA", "Offer to buy her vinyls for the same 50% she offered you, then sell them for the 100%.

That's how ebay works. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSelling stuff on eBay isn't easy, but records are even harder to sell, because of having to grade them, and collectors are pretty fussy, so I imagine you're gettkng a lot of queries too. \n\nIt doesn't actually sound like your neighbour even had a business for you to ruin, and is just selling her old stuff.  If she wants a business, she'll need to start paying taxes, and would need to be paying you a wage instead of giving a cut.", "Not the first time someone binned their business partner and regretted it.", "Even more succinct, Competition isn't someone putting you out of business.

If they've been selling a vinyl for top of the pops 2003 then split up, it's very reasonable they'll both be trying to sell more vinyls of top of the pops 2003, 2004, 2005 etc", "He says \"flipping\" which usually means buying then selling, so he's probably either buying in bulk for cheap or going around thrift shops/garage sales buying cheap records to price up.", "I agree. That's an insult to the cows by comparing it to her. Cows aren't greedy and not all of them are ass.", "But she\u2019s the main character! GAWD!", "A lot of people that like collecting vinyls/starting collections etc. just look for vinyl records and see what comes up within price range they would like to spend. \n\nThere are still those who will search by artist/album but more people search for vinyls in general than you'd think."]}
