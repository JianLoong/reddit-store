As a disabled person myself, I would've probably made the same exact point to him. So long as you didn't raise your voice or insult him or his mother then I don't see the issue. I can understand your friend being upset and it's out of your hands if they choose to exclude you from future events but I don't think you're an asshole. \n\nFYI, most disabled folks aren't super cool about the term \"wheelchair bound\" or \"confined to a wheelchair\".

You just pointed out a very personal flaw in his position.", "NTA. I think you actually nailed it with your response! You weren't being harsh, you didn't insult him, you simply asked him to test his own assumption. We need more moments like this with ignorant people.", "NTA. He was being hypocritical and no one likes it to be pointed out, but....you're right. He needs to seriously rethink what he says and apologize to the blind friend.", "INFO - just to clarify, the guy who was saying benefits should be slashed was the same one whose mum you brought up?", "Ha, there\u2019s nothing like holding up a mirror to someone. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou pointed out his blatant hypocrisy. He is an AH", "NTA. I am the arsehole for seeing your title and letting my brain go immediately to a \u201cyo momma\u201d joke.", "NTA.
