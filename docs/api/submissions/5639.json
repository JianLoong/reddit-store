Bluszcz is Polish and I knew she was going to have a Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve. I did some digging and found out that one of their traditions is to leave an empty seat for a lone wanderer.\n\nI thought this was perfect. I can see her flat from my window so when I saw that they were all gathering I made my way over there. I picked the perfect moment because Bluszcz made a trip to the corner shop and her friends let me in. I knew some of them and they were surprised to see me there. I picked my seat and waited patiently.\n\nWhen Bluszcz came back, she asked what I was doing there and I replied that I was a lone wanderer and needed a seat at the dinner and I knew Polish people left one empty so I figured she would invite me to join them as this is the right thing to do.\n\nShe freaked out, started screaming and threatening to call the police. She was really scary. I asked her what was her problem and she shouted at me to get out. Honestly, she scared me so I figured it was the best to leave. I told her she was crazy and rude and asshole. Some guy told me to leave. The worst part was that my crush wasn\u2019t even there yet. I saw him arriving later through my window.\n\nI got home, super pissed, only to find myself opening the door to police whom Bluszcz called. I told them she was crazy and I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. They told me to try and stay away from her and not go over to her house but they didn\u2019t do anything because obviously, I haven\u2019t committed any crime.\n\nI went to see my family for Christmas dinner today and told everything to my sister. She told me I was the asshole and I should really stop because I am going to get myself in trouble. I said that I won\u2019t because it\u2019s Bluszcz who\u2019s in the wrong, not me but I am wondering.
