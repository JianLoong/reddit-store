My son is 30 and his fianc\u00e9e is 28- They\u2019ve been together 6 years and live together about 4 hours away from me. \n\nI\u2019m a single mother and still have my other 2 adult children living with me. My daughter (22) has a 3yo son who also lives with us since he was born. Due to my daughters situation, I have always been the primary provider for my grandson. I\u2019m not retired, I still work from home and have a lot on my plate. I\u2019m my grandsons childcare whenever she\u2019s working, but overall my grandson has lived with me the whole time. \n\nMy DIL\u2019s dad lives in the same city as me, so my son and her visit together 3-4 times a year. They decided to plan a baby shower at her dads house in addition to a baby shower they had on her mothers side of the family weeks before. We were excited to celebrate them while they visited, and were planning on going. The shower was scheduled from 2-6pm and my daughter worked that day until 3pm. I originally told my son we\u2019d be late due to her work schedule and they said that was fine. Something had happened at my daughters job that day causing her to stay over an hour late, which then she had to drive 25 mins home. I kept texting my son updates on the situation, and explained how I didn\u2019t want to go to the party without her while I also had my grandson. My other adult son is unable to watch my grandson alone, and he doesn\u2019t drive. By 4:30, my son texted me and told me to forget about attending. My daughter was back by 5, and I texted him I was sorry and that we were on our way. He wasn\u2019t returning my phone calls, so I figured we weren\u2019t welcome to show up anymore. I texted him I was just as upset, and to please have him and DIL pick up their gifts at our house when they could. \n\nSince this happened my son was somewhat understanding but his fianc\u00e9e is really upset with me. I\u2019m being told I favorite my daughter, how unsupportive I am, and how we embarrassed them by not being there. My DIL refused to pick up the gifts because \u201cwe couldn\u2019t be bothered\u201d to show up for them on top of them traveling to us. Her and I have always gotten along, but this situation is causing turmoil.

Your daughter, being an adult, could either go or not when she was off work.", "YTA why couldn't you have gone and your daughter just gone after she got off work? \n\nThere was zero reason to wait for your daughter. \n\nIt was rude and showed that you didn't care they have every right to be upset. \n\nI'd be deeply apologizing and hope they forgive you", "This whole post is full of \u2018missing missing reasons\u2019.\n\nYou decided that the inconvenience of having your grandson with you was more important than attending the shower. \nYour ADULT son could not babysit for a couple of hours\u2026.

You should have given your daughter a deadline of saying be home by 2:30 pm or I will go to the baby shower. You should have had your daughter figured out the babysitting situation. \n\nIf you\u2019re not able to make this right expect your son to go NC / LC and don\u2019t expect to be part of your grand kids life.

They\u2019re celebrating a very important event and, at every turn, you chose what kept you from attending. \n\nImagine how embarrassing that was to your son - a shower at his FIL\u2019s house and he\u2019s telling people \u201cmy mom\u2019s on the way!\u201d \u201cMy mom\u2019s running late but she\u2019ll be here\u201d \u201cmy mom isn\u2019t going to make it after all\u201d.

Not attending was your choice and your son has every right to be upset by that choice.

Your wants. Your daughter's wants. There is absolutely no reason you couldn't have gone with your son and grandson. Your daughter could show up or not. You chose your daughter over your son.\n\n>to please have him and DIL pick up their gifts at our house when they could. \n\nAnd now you're expecting them to cater to you and your daughter again. You've already messed up once. Just drop off the presents and apologize. Better yet, figure out a way to prioritize them for once.\n\nWhy is your adult daughter so much more important than your son? \n\nOf course, your son is more understanding. You've likely put him last his entire life. He's used to it (though he likely hates you deep down, which is why your DIL is being so cold to you now). His wife doesn't want her child to be treated in the same way, and she also doesn't want her husband to be treated like crap. \n\nI suggest you figure out a way to apologize and make amends. Otherwise, they'll end up putting you last just like you treat them.", "YTA this was booked way in advance, you should have made a priority of going.  Well done for screwing up a relationship.  I doubt this will be the last time.\n\nYou have main character syndrome thinking the world will fall apart if you are not micro managing your daughters obligations.\n\nYou can either make a big gesture to make things right or become the ultimate Just No MIL and be relegated to NC and LC by your son and DIL", "YTA. This should have been a non-issue, but you made it into one by prioritizing your daughter.", "YTA. \n\nYou are very involved in your grandson's life - you're his \"primary provider.\" Undoubtedly you have taken him places without his mother before, so why did you feel the need to wait for your daughter on this occasion, of all occasions? Why would you risk missing a milestone in your son's life just because your daughter had some issues at work??? \n\nYou're essentially functioning as a second mother to one grandson, putting in tons of time and energy. That's lovely for him and for your daughter, but it seems obvious to the rest of us that you've *also* decided that means you cannot fully be there for your other children and grandchildren. If you wanted to treat them fairly you would have made every effort to attend, but instead all you did was text that you were waiting for your daughter. Again: Why??? Why is *she* so necessary for *your* attendance? Why on earth could you not go without her? It very much reeks of favoritism; you are choosing your daughter & grandson over your son and his family.  \n\nOwn that choice, because you've absolutely made it, and the rest of your family is well aware. \n\nAnd understand that your choice carries consequences. It's quite likely you will not be very involved in the lives of your other grandchildren, especially if you refuse to recognize the problem, apologize for your favoritism, and make amends. \n\nYour son has seen that you have a favorite grandchild before his kids are even born. (If your daughter has always been the favorite over him, this will be doubly true.) No parent in their right mind would want their kid to be continually disappointed by a grandmother who just doesn't think they're important enough to make time for, who won't be there for them if it's in any way a problem for the Favorite (Grand)Child. That would break his kid's heart, and it's his job to prevent that. \n\nYour son's most important role as of now is being a father, and if he decides to protect his children from being disappointed by your favoritism, that is absolutely his right. In fact, it's him being a good father. So if you find that you have very little contact with your son's child, give him due respect for being a protective father, and recognize that it's *your* choices that led you here.", "YTA and you know it, it\u2019s hard to believe you are that clueless on what you should have done. Please explain after 3 years you are still the primary caretaker of your grandchild?  That\u2019s fine if that is what you want, but not ok when you can\u2019t even be there for your  son and DIL for a celebration like this.  Why couldn\u2019t you take your grandson with you and let his mom meet up at the shower?", "Wow. You embarrassed your son and were completely disrespectful to your DIL and her family by being a no show. I don\u2019t blame them for not talking to you. There\u2019s no reason you had to wait for your daughter once you knew you were looking at being *hours late* to the baby shower. YTA. \n\nFWIW, I\u2019m the favorite daughter in my family and I HATE when my mom does this. The first year I moved far away, she didn\u2019t end up serving Thanksgiving dinner until 10pm because she waited to do the grocery shopping so I could go with her when I got there. There are people who refuse to go to a meal at her house now, and it aims resentment from the rest of the family at me. \n\nDeal with the codependency, whether it\u2019s the both of you together or you towards your daughter. You owe your son and DIL a boatload of apologies, and her family as well.", "YTA. Sounds like you play favorites a lot because it\u2019s easy to give to the ones who live with you. They wanted one time for you to show up for them and you wouldn\u2019t do that. You could easily have gone with your grandson and only your daughter would have been late or missed it. You chose not to go, and that\u2019s how they see it.", "Missing missing reasons galore! \n\nYTA", "YTA she could have met all of you at the shower.", "YTA\n\nYou need to be accountable for the decisions you made.  You punished your responsible son/DIL and newest family member to prioritize your other ADULT children and a grandson who definitely could have attended with you. You see them all the time.  You help then all the time.  \n\nUnless you're all sharing one vehicle and the daughter had it at work, I cannot see any reason whatsoever not to make sure you were at this baby shower.  They travelled to you AND you still couldn't even get across town for them.  Your daughter could have refused the OT or met up at the shower when she was done.  You had options but like you said \"I didn't want to go without her\".  \n\nThis is super important and I'm sure DIL is being most vocal because she is also mad about how hurt her husband is.  He wanted so much to share his joy with his mom and family.  Can you really not see how you not coming made him feel?  Or understand he feels this upset because of how important you are to him? \n\nTake the presents to them and apologise!!!", "YTA. Also, time to stop describing yourself as a single mother. You have three GROWN children. And yes you favor the daughter & yeah just shitty you couldn\u2019t show up at a shower. You\u2019re 63, not 80. You describe yourself as primary caretaker of the 3y/o but you couldn\u2019t get him into the car to attend a celebration for your other child. Just, yuck.", "Sounds like you routinely push your oldest son to the bottom of your to-do list, and while you\u2019ve trained him to be grateful for any tiny crumb of attention you toss to him once you\u2019re done with everyone else, your son\u2019s wife absolutely has your number.\n\nThere was no reason to miss that baby shower. Your daughter could have met you all there. You privileged her mild dislike of doing something on her own over the notion of celebrating your son\u2019s impending fatherhood or a new baby. \n\nYou *are* unsupportive, you *did* embarrass your son at what was meant to be a family gathering, and you *do* play open favorites. Your DIL is wise to make sure you don\u2019t get to hurt her baby as much as you do her partner. YTA.", "YTA. I bet this isn't the only time your only self-sufficient child has been let down by you for his siblings. And then to make them pick up their own gifts was just a final slap in the face.  \n\n\nI'd love to hear the reason you didn't go with just the baby.", "YTA. There were many things you could have done to go. First of all, you could have just went with your grandson. Or you could have told your daughter to be a mom and leave work. It seems you are prioritizing your other kids over your son. I doubt this is the first time to. You need to fix this before they stop talking to you all together.", "YTAH, while I can empathize with your daughter needing childcare this was still a very important day to your son and his *fianc\u00e9e. You *could* have taken your grandchild but you didn\u2019t *want* to, which cool that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t act so shocked that it\u2019s causing a rift. You chose staying home to wait for your daughter to show up over going to your son\u2019s first child\u2019s baby shower, that\u2019s an experience/memory they will never have the chance to replicate. Furthermore, I can\u2019t blame DIL for not wanting to come get the gifts. You should be traveling to see them, apologizing for missing the shower, and *giving* them their gifts instead of insisting they go out of their way to pick them up.", "YTA- you're not a single mom anymore. You're a mother with grown ass children yet you're still taking care of babies because you're watching your grandson fulltime for your daughter. Admirable yes, but you're neglecting your other adult kids lives to give all of your attention to this one daughter and grandson.  You are unsupportive and showing favoritism. You knew when this event was and could have told your daughter to arrange other childcare on that day so you could attend, you could have gotten a baby sitter and attended, you could have taken the kid with you and attended WITHOUT your daughter. But instead you just said screw you, daughter is late so I'm just not going.  You're being a pretty shitty parent to your son and his future wife.", "You are a MAJOR AH!! So your 22 yr old is able to have a child but can't walk in to a party for her brother alone??? And instead of you telling her to meet you there, you think it's ok to show up at the end of the party??? Wow! I had parents like you, the others were always more important. I have lc with my mom because I was tired of being last for everything. My birthday, graduation and even my wedding. I don't blame your DIL. You embarrassed them completely. How awful for your own mom to not even show up for the baby shower that they planned in your city. You only had to show up! How do you feel no shame? Guess your GC and grandson are enough. At least I hope they are because your son and DIL will no longer worry about including you. How awful for them. \nYTA YTA YTA!!", "YTA, OP.  Poor planning, poor execution of the weak plan and even though it was you that messed up, instead of getting off your bum to take them the gifts, you want them to make the trip??!  Unbelievable.", "Was it a child free event? Otherwise why didn\u2019t you go without your daughter and she could have come when she was done with work? Is it hard to travel with grandson and disabled son?", "YTA. You should have made your son\u2019s only baby shower a priority. You should have had your daughter figure out childcare so you could be there with them.\n\nWhen she was delayed,\nYou should have gone in your own with the kid.\n\nWhen it all blew up, you should have delivered the gifts.\n\nYou\u2019re basically saying your current grandchild and your daughter are more important to you than they are.\n\nIt was a one time thing and there was no reason you couldn\u2019t have made it and you chose not to.\n\nBe better.", "YTA", "YTA you are playing favorites your son can not look after his own kid red flag. Have you heard of a babysitter?", "YTA. A hard thing to realize is that sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter what the reason is. But a continued pattern of not prioritizing someone will result in them pulling away. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have all the legitimate excuses in the world. When you don\u2019t show up for big events, that is the natural result. I\u2019m going through this with an aunt I used to be really close to. In the last 5 years, every one of her trips something always comes up and she can\u2019t fulfill her promises. It\u2019s always legitimate \u2014 covid, emergency with one of her kids, dad in hospital, a scheduling snafoo, etc. but you know what? I stopped making an effort. This time around I had a specific time window, and made no adjustments on my end. And guess what? Thankfully I didn\u2019t change my plans, she had to bail for another family emergency. Sadly, that\u2019s probably the last time I try to make plans with her. If it happens naturally, great, but our relationship has definitely changed. That\u2019s the reality of adult relationships. If you want to maintain them, you need to prioritize them. End of story. If you want your son and DIL in your life, you need to make a change so that you can uphold commitments and stop having excuses pop up. If my mom couldn\u2019t make it to my partner\u2019s baby shower for such a lame excuse, AND was bugging me during it? It would take me some time to work through my frustration and wanting distance tbh.", "YTA Your daughter could have gotten a babysitter for 1 day or you could have asked if you could take grandson. You chose to be there for your daughter only. Those trips to town to visit family in the future don't expect many to include visits with you.

I would let your son and DIL know that you take accountability, see their side and that they are correct in their feelings of being upset. This was their first baby shower and it was overshadowed by horrible planning on your and your daughter\u2019s part.", "Sounds to me like your son moved away because of how your family does things. You say you\u2019re a single mother with a 22 year old daughter living with you along with her 3 year old? So she was 19 when she got pregnant, and has been co-parenting with you for 3 years?? Where is the dad? Did your daughter have a baby shower at all? Maybe your daughter has deep rooted animosity towards your son and his fianc\u00e9 becoming a family and bringing a child into something none of you have for yourselves. Why else wouldn\u2019t she just tell you to take the baby and have her figure it out later? I\u2019m sensing something else!", "YTA. You're allowing your daughter to overuse your babysitting services to the detriment of your relationship with your oldest child who you only get to see a few times a year at best. The baby shower was a big deal for them but your routine babysitting help for your 22 yo daughter took priority. You need to draw some boundaries with your 22 yo daughter so that you aren't giving your older son and DIL the leftovers of your time. Your daughter needs to budget so she can pay other babysitters at times, so that you are not always tied to being her babysitter.", "YTA. I couldn\u2019t imagine this dynamic and it\u2019s gotta be super annoying for your future DIL. \nGrandma on dads side can\u2019t just be grandma, she comes with 3 other people or not at all. A grown family of codependents. It\u2019s gonna be every time they bring their child to visit, their child will never get that 1 on 1 undivided attention from gma because your obligated to the grandchild that\u2019s lived with you since birth. (Who has also gotten your undivided attention since birth) Ugh.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t prioritize your son and DIL at all. They drove 4 hours to have a party in your city so that you could be there. It sounds like it was co-ed, so there\u2019s no reason why your son and grandson couldn\u2019t go. Your daughter also could have prioritized her brother\u2019s event, and chose not to. This is your kids\u2019 first kid. You don\u2019t to have another first kid. You dropped the ball over and over, and owe them a *HUGE* apology.

We do not know this woman's circumstances,  we don't know a lot of details here. For those of you saying he daughter should \"suck it up, she's a grown woman\". Have any of you ever dealt with social anxiety?  Or anxiety in general?  \nI have a 3 year old grandson, I do watch him and I watched his older siblings and cousins when they were younger... not everyone can afford childcare!  Back to having a 3 yr old... enjoying any gathering while watching a toddler is not easy.  When my daughter and I are both there it is much easier, for us and for him. Sometimes working over is not really an option,  especially if you really need the money.", "Mostly NTA your daughter is. She should\u2019ve just planned to drive there after work and meet you there in the first place. And when there was a crisis at work, she should\u2019ve told you to just go on ahead.

My son is 30 and his fianc\u00e9e is 28- They\u2019ve been together 6 years and live together about 4 hours away from me. \n\nI\u2019m a single mother and still have my other 2 adult children living with me. My daughter (22) has a 3yo son who also lives with us since he was born. Due to my daughters situation, I have always been the primary provider for my grandson. I\u2019m not retired, I still work from home and have a lot on my plate. I\u2019m my grandsons childcare whenever she\u2019s working, but overall my grandson lived with me the whole time. \n\nMy DIL\u2019s dad lives in the same city as me, so my son and her visit together 3-4 times a year. They decided to plan a baby shower at her dads house in addition to a baby shower they had on her mothers side of the family weeks before. We were excited to celebrate them while they visited, and were planning on going. The shower was scheduled from 2-6pm and my daughter worked that day until 3pm. I originally told my son we\u2019d be late due to her work schedule and they said that was fine. Something had happened at my daughters job that day causing her to stay over an hour late, which then she had to drive 25 mins home. I kept texting my son updates on the situation, and explained how I didn\u2019t want to go to the party without her while I also had my grandson. My other adult son is unable to watch my grandson alone, and he doesn\u2019t drive. My son texted me and told me to forget about attending. My daughter was back by 5, and I texted him I was sorry and that we were on our way. He wasn\u2019t returning my phone calls, so I figured we weren\u2019t welcome to show up anymore. I texted him I was just as upset, and to please have him and DIL pick up their gifts at our house when they could. \n\nSince this happened my son was somewhat understanding but his fianc\u00e9e is really upset with me. I\u2019m being told I favorite my daughter, how unsupportive I am, and how we embarrassed them by not being there. My DIL refused to pick up the gifts because \u201cwe couldn\u2019t be bothered\u201d to show up for them on top of them traveling to us. Her and I have always gotten along, but this situation is causing turmoil. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You prioritized your daughter over your son again.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA", "we planned on driving together since my daughter didn\u2019t feel comfortable going alone. Ontop of me just  taking her son. I kept waiting and waiting until I realized it was 4:30 and she wasn\u2019t back", "my son is disabled, he was going to attend with us.", "Plus, if I was son and DIL I'd be pissed that OP kept texting during the shower. Like, they can't even enjoy it because they keep getting interrupted with her texts.", "I\u2019m also guessing that this isn\u2019t the first time that the other two kids (and grandkid) took priority over the son. This might have been a final straw.", "Lmao I should have come to the comments first", "OP said that her son is disabled in another comment. Also, we don\u2019t know if the grandson has behavior issues that require his mother to be present for outside activities. Maybe OP didn\u2019t want to babysit and wanted to enjoy the baby shower which meant her daughter had to come? \n\nOr maybe her daughter is the golden child, but it\u2019s usually the disabled child who gets that pedigree so who knows.", ">You should have given your daughter a deadline of saying be home by 2:30 pm or I will go to the baby shower. \n\nOr just fuckin' go to the baby shower without waiting for her at all. Daughter drives, she can get there on her own. For whatever reason OP didn't want to go with her grandson without her daughter, but if she's responsible for as much childcare as she says, she's *got* to be used to taking grandson places without his mom. Why not make this a priority? \n\nIt just absolutely reeks of favoritism up in here.", "I was thinking that too.  Not just embarrassing to not have his family show up, but to distract him from the celebration with constant updates that yielded nothing compromised his ability to enjoy it.", "I feel so sad for her son! That\u2019s got to be so demoralizing. I hope his wife\u2019s family is a good support system for him.", ">No parent in their right mind would want their kid to be continually disappointed by a grandmother who just doesn't think they're important enough to make time for, who won't be there for them if it's in any way a problem for the Favorite (Grand)Child. That would break his kid's heart, and it's his job to prevent that. \n\nThis is what stood out to me too. In most cases where a grandparent provides childcare for some grandchildren and not others there will be inequality in treatment. OP has just proved beyond doubt that the grandson she looks after, and his mother's, wants comes before anyone else's. Although disappointing and hurtful I think it's best for the son and DIL to know where they stand and possibly limit their child feeling the same way in the future.", "Yep. Nail on the head with the codependency. All I can say is YUCK to OP. This behavior is so unbelievably selfish and dripping in codependency, I her son and DIL cut her off so she\u2019s maybe pushed to start working through some of this. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your mom. That\u2019s insane. :(", "I thought I was the only one who felt this too! \nI think the daughter did this kinda on purpose.

If she did it would have been prioritized regardless", "She knew lonh ago about the shower she needed to tell her daughter that day no I can't babysit you need to find other child care and if she needed help with her disabled son she needed to find care for him also and focus on her son having the child she had way advance notice", "It\u2019s all of the subtext that gives it away. There is no way this is an isolated incident, and there were many many alternatives here to missing her DIL\u2019s baby shower. She should have at the least given a cut off time to the daughter for when she\u2019d be leaving with the grandson to attend the shower and preemptively communicated when she\u2019d be there, THEN show up at that time. To text updates during the event and still no show is so wildly rude and inappropriate. When you are holding an event getting updates like this from family you have a complicated relationship with is so upsetting. The mom is extremely selfish for putting that on them on a day where they are supposed to be celebrating.", "Agree! I\u2019m so surprised at the voting", "YTA. You need to stop coddling your daughter. You  are basically raising her child for her, in addition to  having a plate full of other responsibilities. It\u2019s time for her to grow up. Take the gifts over to your son and DIL and apologize profusely while you\u2019re there. Then promise them that you are just as dedicated to being a good grandmother to their baby as you are to your grandson. After that sit your daughter down and give her a timeline to get her life together. She needs to realize that you have other kids who need your love and support and she\u2019s consuming all of it.", "But then the planned changed.

How does your daughter not feel comfortable going to a different house in the same city?", "Doesn\u2019t want to go alone? Tough shit!

You had options here. If taking your grandson to the shower wouldn't work, you could have told your daughter ahead if time that you couldn't watch him that day and she would need to get a sitter. You could have even offered to pay for the sitter if money is an issue.", "YTA- sounds like they have seen you bend over backwards to support your own daughter for many years, but when they ask you to put them first for once, you were not prepared to do that. \n\nUnless you carve time out to be a true grandparent like you are to your grandson, you\u2019ll never have a good relationship with them.", "Yes you are the AH!! A Huge on!! \n\n  Your daughter  knew you had an important  event  but still stayed over work over an hour later than planned.  Since she can't live on her own, can't raise her child and can't show up to a party on her own I doubt she has a job that would have been so critical for her to stay that much over. Especially in a day when she knew she was already causing you to be late for an event. OH,  wait she needed to be the main character and have momma's full attention. \n\nWhen you found out she was going to cause you to be even later you should have prioritized your son and went without her. \n\n Your son will be low contact or no contact.  You will not see your newest grandbaby and you know what that is your fault, you did not prioritize your son for once!\n\nYou have coddled two of your children to the point that you have pushed your third away. I hope having \"Adult\" children was worth the relationship with your son and his family.", "YTA. If this shower was a priority for you, you would have been there. You would have gotten your ducks in a row ahead of time, and you would have been there.  There were several ways you could have made that happen. Not showing up last minute was ridiculous, unnecessary, & needlessly hurtful to your son & DIL.", "YTA it sounds like you\u2019re codependent on your daughter and if your son and DIL go LC/NC on you it\u2019s going to be your fault not theirs", "Yta. Why wouldn\u2019t you just take the mans nephew??? It\u2019s not a strange child, it\u2019s his family? Also your ADULT child needs to grow the fuck up and take care of her own kid.

If it were me an offer to meet for dinner would've gone a long way to showing that you cared about having some quality time with them.\n\nOn top of that you make no mention of ever making the effort to travel to see them.

For showing your son and DIL that they aren\u2019t priorities at all. Babysitters exist for a reason. You should have hired a babysitter for the whole day and been there to help set up the party, and stayed the entire time.

None of your reasons for waiting for her are valid. Not one of them.\n\nYou're already doing a lot supporting her and basically raising your grandchild. You cannot keep babying your adult daughter who is a mother herself. Old enough to get pregnant and keep the baby = old enough to get her own self to her brother's baby shower.\n\n\nYes, you're playing favorites. Your son lives so far away and you missed a chance to see him AND to celebrate a major milestone.

My parents are like this and I barely ever talk/see them anymore and I honestly don\u2019t care to.", "YTA - and the way it reads is that your daughter always comes first, that you put her above your sons and that is disgusting. You have three children, not one. Start to be a better mother before you lose them. \nYour daughter is old enough to sort her own life and baby out, even if it means she has to pay for a nanny.

No you can't go without me, we can all go together when I get back and then there is suddenly an emergency and I have to stay late oh and look It's too late for us to go now.", "Right \u2026 seems to have forgotten about that mythical clock right on the phone screen.", "Yet his wife is the be who\u2019s mad. Not the son.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. Op was TA even before daughter got stuck at work. If it\u2019s a special event for your other child, daughter either takes time off work to watch her own child or finds a sitter or whatever she has to do so that op can be there for her other child.", "Literally what I was thinking!", "That's a big assumption to make. Age is just a number 1 person at 63 is very different to another at 63. \n\nAs OP is ostensibly working, and full time carer for both her grandchild and adult son with an unknown disability (we don't know what it is or to what degree) we would assume she's reasonably well for her age. Or she wouldn't be able to handle these duties day on and day out. \n\nIf she's not her daughter is a massive A taking advantage of her aging mother who is not physically up to these caring duties.", "63 is not retirement age in most countries - majority of 63 year olds I know are working full time in my country."]}
