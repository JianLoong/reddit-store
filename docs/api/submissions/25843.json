My sister used to be Lark and I'm Indigo (named after the plant). Our mom changed her name to a nature name when she was 19. For our parents our names needed to be easy to say and spell but they wanted uncommon names. My sister was never super fond of her name. But around the age of 16 she got really annoyed by her name and told our parents she wanted to change it. They offered her support and asked if she wanted to change it then or wait. She decided to change her name then but couldn't decide what she wanted to be so she waited. She ended up changing her name at 20 to a more common and classic/timeless name. Think Emily or Elizabeth. At the time she changed her name my sister said we should both change our names and send a message to our parents that they fucked up. I told her I loved my name so wouldn't be changing it. She asked me if I didn't want an ordinary name and I said no.\n\nFast forward to today and my sister met up with an old friend of hers from school. This friend was not around when my sister changed her name. So when they first met up she was still calling her Lark. My sister corrected her and the friend accepted it. My sister came to my house the very next day and said that her friend had acted so surprised to hear she changed her name. She asked the friend why and the friend said she always thought we had the coolest names and she was always so jealous and it surprised her that she didn't like the name.\n\nWhile my sister was at my house she got so angry about what her friend had said. She even took me aback with the venom she spoke with. She was like how could anyone prefer Lark to \"current name\" and why would anyone be jealous of a dumb name like it. She told me she despises when people compliment the name or when she has to correct people who don't know her name today.\n\nThis isn't the first time my sister got annoyed with people who were shocked that she changed her name and it's not the first time she has admitted wanting to yell in the face of someone who complimented her old name. This time was the most angry she got though. But it has been a thing for 5 years now.\n\nMy sister kept ranting away and then she started saying our parents were shitty parents who only thought of themselves and not us. I told her she needed to calm down because she didn't like her name and they supported her in changing it. But I love my name and our parents made no mistake in naming me. She told me I probably loved her old name too and also don't understand her changing it and she was starting to say fuck me and everything when I told her that she was too extreme about the thought that some people will like her old name. I also pointed out that she ASKED the friend why she was surprised and all the friend was is honest. I told her she has the name she chose now but it's not healthy to be so irrationally angry over this.\n\nMy sister didn't take it well and I feel like I should have seen this coming.

The reason I might be TA is because this is possibly just a sore subject for her since she strongly disliked her old name and did not know at the time what name she wanted in it's place. Maybe having people like the old name brings back some weird feelings for her. So it might be insensitive for me to say what I did.

Some are more unusual than others. Once people know the name, they seem to move on. I like the name Lark, and obviously your parents did too. However, they supported her name change.

I wonder if she\u2019s questioning her decision to change her name and wants affirmation. I gave my daughter a timeless name. Unfortunately, it was extremely popular the year she was born, and there were always several girls with the same name. She unofficially changed her name in elementary school, and now that\u2019s what almost everyone calls her. Occasionally, people (mostly relatives) call her by her birth name, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother her.\n\nEdited to add: She should consider herself lucky the Zappas aren\u2019t her parents.", "NTA.

But her hatred for her old name has been clear for years now. \n\nSomeone mentioned and I have thought before that she might feel upset that I didn't agree to change my name with her. She wanted me to and it's possible she internalized some negative feelings about me not wanting to do the same. \n\nOr maybe she's more sensitive around me because she knows I love both the names and feels like it's an insult to her or something?

I have a very common name because dad chose mine and he prefers common names. So I never had many difficulties with my name. Still love it too. I don\u2019t know. We live by a name for so many years we become accustomed to it, we have the right to love it and feels it is us. \n\nNevertheless, your sister has the right to hate her old name (or yours) but she\u2019s an AH for being so loud about it and trying to make you change your name.

I don't think parents did anything wrong with the names, they're beautiful names, but I find it odd that someone that changed their name because they hated how boring it was, can't understand that someone may want to change it because it's too unique. I mean as an extrovert, it would be cool to have a unique name. As an introvert like me, I probably honestly would've had a breakdown from the constant unnecessary conversations about the uniqueness of my name every time I enter the room.

So let her have her emotions and respect her desire to move on from the name.\n\nThat said, she put herself in this situation by questioning her friend's surprise rather than just moving the conversation on, and I would bet she is always on the defensive when surprise it expressed. And surprise is to be expected since it's not common for someone to change their name, especially if there didn't seem to have been bullying or gender affirmation associated with it. So it would probably be worth her looking into therapy to help her process her anger and clear resentment of your parents, as well as to learn coping techniques for these inevitable conversations. \n\nTL;DR - she has a right to be annoyed at people not just accepting she has changed her name, but you're equally right in pointing out that she needs to deal with her anger in a more healthy way.", "No arseholes here: but she doesn't need to be told to calm down, she needs therapy.", "NTA.

You can kindly suggest that she see a therapist to work on her feelings towards your parents and childhood, as many have suggested. Just be aware that she may lash out at the suggestion. The suggestion of therapy by others can often make the person defensive, particularly if they don't believe there is anything wrong with their behavior.\n\nPersonally, I think your names were lovely, but I wholeheartedly understand that having an uncommon name may not suit every individual.

My name is one with many nicknames and it took time to decide which one I liked best and thought suited me best. \n\nYou do you, honey, and let her do her.

I would also say Indigo sounds like a more \"feminine\" name than Lark, which almost sounds like it could be a male name. Perhaps this is part of her hang-up about it, whether she's verbalized that or not. \n\nShe's definitely overreacting and being rude. She was allowed to change the name and supported in doing so. I could see how having someone ask you \"oh, why did you change it?\" rather than just accepting the change (similar to deadnaming a trans person or asking \"why\" they transitioned) could be upsetting, but I think your sister's reaction to that was overblown. That said, I think there's some room for understanding that she had to live many, many years with a name she apparently really hated for whatever reason and that there is probably some resentment and frustration about that that just still needs some venting. I suspect given some time she'll be able to calm down about it and not have it bother her as much anymore, and hopefully she won't be making weird requests for you to change your name with her, etc.", "NTA, almost NAH.

She was an asshole for how she spoke to you in this situation, and an asshole to herself for setting herself up for this situation by asking, and for not moving on now that her name has changed.", "Lark, there are people that are dying", "INFO: Are those the actual names? Cause Indigo is way cooler than lark imo... -_-", "NTA - I was given an uncommon name and was not particularly bullied for it but people were shocked when they heard/read it. Often they would mis-pronounce it and I'd feel somewhat outcasted, I later realised I disliked the name for other (personal) reasons and changed it to another uncommon name because I learned to love the feeling of having an uncommon name and didn't want to lose that.\n\nHowever, I can understand that even though she was not bullied for it (as I read in one of OP's comments) the name may have still given her trauma. She may feel like having the name she was viewed as strange and outcasted even if in reality she was not. Personally when letting go of my old name I wrote it down on an old plate and smashed it on the ground. It allowed me to let go of the person I was when I had the name and all the resentment I held towards the name. \n\nMaybe you could offer an excersize like this to your sister? She could burn the name on a peice of paper or smash the plate like I did. With the amount of anger and hatred she seems to hold towards that name I'd say the plate is probably the best bet as she can break it and stomp on, even scream as she does so and let it all out. It would also show her that though you didn't join her in changing your name you support her choice to change it and allow her to express and release the resentment she holds to it. Might also be a nice touch if you get her a small necklace or something of the sort with her new name engraved on it.", "NTA between you and your sister, but her feelings when she introduces herself by her new name and people responding negatively are valid.

They will probably love you forever and if they hate the name you will not get stuck like poor OP in the middle of assholery.
