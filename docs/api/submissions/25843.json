{"id": 25843, "submission_id": "1658y27", "title": "AITA she's way too extreme about people liking her old name?", "selftext": "My sister and I were both given nature names by our parents. My sister used to be Lark and I'm Indigo (named after the plant). Our mom changed her name to a nature name when she was 19. For our parents our names needed to be easy to say and spell but they wanted uncommon names. My sister was never super fond of her name. But around the age of 16 she got really annoyed by her name and told our parents she wanted to change it. They offered her support and asked if she wanted to change it then or wait. She decided to change her name then but couldn't decide what she wanted to be so she waited. She ended up changing her name at 20 to a more common and classic/timeless name. Think Emily or Elizabeth. At the time she changed her name my sister said we should both change our names and send a message to our parents that they fucked up. I told her I loved my name so wouldn't be changing it. She asked me if I didn't want an ordinary name and I said no.\n\nFast forward to today and my sister met up with an old friend of hers from school. This friend was not around when my sister changed her name. So when they first met up she was still calling her Lark. My sister corrected her and the friend accepted it. My sister came to my house the very next day and said that her friend had acted so surprised to hear she changed her name. She asked the friend why and the friend said she always thought we had the coolest names and she was always so jealous and it surprised her that she didn't like the name.\n\nWhile my sister was at my house she got so angry about what her friend had said. She even took me aback with the venom she spoke with. She was like how could anyone prefer Lark to \"current name\" and why would anyone be jealous of a dumb name like it. She told me she despises when people compliment the name or when she has to correct people who don't know her name today.\n\nThis isn't the first time my sister got annoyed with people who were shocked that she changed her name and it's not the first time she has admitted wanting to yell in the face of someone who complimented her old name. This time was the most angry she got though. But it has been a thing for 5 years now.\n\nMy sister kept ranting away and then she started saying our parents were shitty parents who only thought of themselves and not us. I told her she needed to calm down because she didn't like her name and they supported her in changing it. But I love my name and our parents made no mistake in naming me. She told me I probably loved her old name too and also don't understand her changing it and she was starting to say fuck me and everything when I told her that she was too extreme about the thought that some people will like her old name. I also pointed out that she ASKED the friend why she was surprised and all the friend was is honest. I told her she has the name she chose now but it's not healthy to be so irrationally angry over this.\n\nMy sister didn't take it well and I feel like I should have seen this coming.

The reason I might be TA is because this is possibly just a sore subject for her since she strongly disliked her old name and did not know at the time what name she wanted in it's place. Maybe having people like the old name brings back some weird feelings for her. So it might be insensitive for me to say what I did. I also feel like she knows I don't get it so maybe she took what I said especially hard.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can see why that name would give her trouble whereas indigo wouldn\u2019t. Idk what you get out of being holier than thou just cause you\u2019re fine with your own name", "YTA - You should have supported your sister and just let her rant. Be honest with yourself, you know that your parents abused your sister by naming her Lark.", "Ehh maybe she was just venting to you because she felt comfortable going on a big rant to get it out? I don\u2019t know lol, but she does seem dramatic. \n\n\nMaybe she\u2019s got bigger problems with your parents but is instead focusing on this aspect? \n\nI\u2019d personally be annoyed and irritated if my parents had called me an uncommon, new, uniquely weird kinda name, and I would\u2019ve changed it but I wouldn\u2019t have gone on a massive rant about it personally. Which makes me believe there\u2019s more going on besides the name?\n\nI think you\u2019re justified to be upset with her for her overreaction. But I don\u2019t think you can be annoyed at her for not liking that name. Lark is a pretty dumb name ngl", "NTA. As a high school teacher, I hear all kinds of names. Some are more unusual than others. Once people know the name, they seem to move on. I like the name Lark, and obviously your parents did too. However, they supported her name change. I don\u2019t know if your sister was ever teased about her name, but I\u2019ve learned kids will find any excuse to tease or bully another kid, if they\u2019re so inclined. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why your sister is so angry. I wonder if she\u2019s questioning her decision to change her name and wants affirmation. I gave my daughter a timeless name. Unfortunately, it was extremely popular the year she was born, and there were always several girls with the same name. She unofficially changed her name in elementary school, and now that\u2019s what almost everyone calls her. Occasionally, people (mostly relatives) call her by her birth name, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother her.\n\nEdited to add: She should consider herself lucky the Zappas aren\u2019t her parents.", "NTA. Your sister definitely has some major issues with her old name (that likely need to be worked out with a professional) and you pointing them out doesn\u2019t necessarily make you an AH.", "We have talked before. She wasn't picked on for her name. She just hated it. She hated our parents for giving her an uncommon name. The name was just very much something she hated but she also hated mine. Part of me does think she feels somewhat abandoned because I kept my name and didn't want to join her in picking common names.", "Or maybe she is regretting changing it ? And that\u2019s why she is lashing out ? Because she can\u2019t go back to it ? And because of that she wants everyone to say what a great decision she made of changing it .. Idk tho but I agree with you", "We're 15 months apart with her being a little older. She was very popular in school and had lots of friends. Yes, we have talked about her changing her name and her hatred for her old one.", "It's possible. My mom always said she knew what it was like to be given a name you hated. She had what she considered to be a boring and uninspired name when she was a kid and it never felt right to her. She never wanted us to feel that way so full support if we wanted something different. I always appreciated it even though I always loved my name.", "She wasn't bullied.", "Haha, I see what you did there!", "It could be that. It did take her a while to figure out what name she wanted to go for.", "My sister is 25 and I don't think she was asked that but maybe.", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, je m\u2019appelle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Je suis une fille comme les auuuuutres. \ud83c\udfb5", "I love both so I wouldn't have been upset with either. But not everyone will have the same taste. My sister and I are very different in the names we like. I'd be more like our parents with my name and her old name. I think she likes names more like our grandparents did when they named our mom.", "Well, for me it is the contrary. I don't like Indigo, but think that Lark is cool name. So this is pretty individual, and it is safe to say that OP's sister has bigger issues than a name.", "I'm not trying to compare our situations. We feel differently about our names so of course things will be different for each. I love both names and she hates both.", "No, I was asking if I was.", "how is she AH? She was honest with her sister", "Are you ex-Lark?", "I fully disagree with that part. I think our parents picked great names but she doesn't and she's allowed to feel that way.", "Wat? I know a girl named Lark and everyone thinks she cool", "What? How did they abuse her?", "Outside of this she has always seemed close to our parents. But her hatred for her old name has been clear for years now. \n\nSomeone mentioned and I have thought before that she might feel upset that I didn't agree to change my name with her. She wanted me to and it's possible she internalized some negative feelings about me not wanting to do the same. \n\nOr maybe she's more sensitive around me because she knows I love both the names and feels like it's an insult to her or something? I'm not sure. We've talked about this stuff before but she never really said why she hated her name so much or why she felt I should hate mine too.", "She\u2019s not entitled to you making choices to appease her tastes in things. Like names. I love unusual names and I always had. I know people who don\u2019t. My sister has a female version of a German male name and we live in France and it was hard making everyone to understand how to say or write the name. She loves it. She thinks it\u2019s unique. I have a very common name because dad chose mine and he prefers common names. So I never had many difficulties with my name. Still love it too. I don\u2019t know. We live by a name for so many years we become accustomed to it, we have the right to love it and feels it is us. \n\nNevertheless, your sister has the right to hate her old name (or yours) but she\u2019s an AH for being so loud about it and trying to make you change your name. Or manipulate you to. Or judging every people who love unusual names.\n\nI wish my name was Potatoe. Oh she would hate me.", "That would be a plot twist. But she obviously has issues with the name. But I love a good plot twist.", "Did you ever discover the near exacting details as to why she hated the name so passionately?", "Naming your child, especially your little girl, Lark, is asking for her to be bullied. Abuse.", "Maybe that one is ex-Lark.", "Yeah that definitely sounds a bit odd. I suppose it most likely is because she feels kind of betrayed that you didn\u2019t want to change yours as well (understandably).", "I have asked her why and she said it never felt right to her and she hated it. Never could say why so much other than she has mentioned loving more common names. But I'm not sure it explains her hating it so passionately.", "Why? My sister was never bullied for her name.", "are you stupid? The family member is telling you that she was not buliied but you are not ready to believe her", "They didn't name her Turd McButtface. Personally, I'm loving the name Lark (but don't tell Emily that).", "I wish I knew for sure. Someone else suggested maybe she regrets changing her name and it's possible. Or maybe she regrets the name she changed it to because she had to think on the name for some time first. There are so many possibilities. Maybe my sister doesn't even know.\n\nMy mom sorta understands her feelings because she hated her given name. But that's where that ends because mom never hated hers so passionately. \n\nIt's all so complicated.", "On a somewhat related note how would you classify your family situation? (high/middle/low class) Would you describe your sis as someone who wants to climb the corporate ladder/wanting to be the most hirable person?", "We're middle class. My sister is a teacher who I don't think would ever have an interest in entering the corporate world."]}
