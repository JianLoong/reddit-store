My sister used to be Lark and I'm Indigo (named after the plant). Our mom changed her name to a nature name when she was 19. For our parents our names needed to be easy to say and spell but they wanted uncommon names. My sister was never super fond of her name. But around the age of 16 she got really annoyed by her name and told our parents she wanted to change it. They offered her support and asked if she wanted to change it then or wait. She decided to change her name then but couldn't decide what she wanted to be so she waited. She ended up changing her name at 20 to a more common and classic/timeless name. Think Emily or Elizabeth. At the time she changed her name my sister said we should both change our names and send a message to our parents that they fucked up. I told her I loved my name so wouldn't be changing it. She asked me if I didn't want an ordinary name and I said no.\n\nFast forward to today and my sister met up with an old friend of hers from school. This friend was not around when my sister changed her name. So when they first met up she was still calling her Lark. My sister corrected her and the friend accepted it. My sister came to my house the very next day and said that her friend had acted so surprised to hear she changed her name. She asked the friend why and the friend said she always thought we had the coolest names and she was always so jealous and it surprised her that she didn't like the name.\n\nWhile my sister was at my house she got so angry about what her friend had said. She even took me aback with the venom she spoke with. She was like how could anyone prefer Lark to \"current name\" and why would anyone be jealous of a dumb name like it. She told me she despises when people compliment the name or when she has to correct people who don't know her name today.\n\nThis isn't the first time my sister got annoyed with people who were shocked that she changed her name and it's not the first time she has admitted wanting to yell in the face of someone who complimented her old name. This time was the most angry she got though. But it has been a thing for 5 years now.\n\nMy sister kept ranting away and then she started saying our parents were shitty parents who only thought of themselves and not us. I told her she needed to calm down because she didn't like her name and they supported her in changing it. But I love my name and our parents made no mistake in naming me. She told me I probably loved her old name too and also don't understand her changing it and she was starting to say fuck me and everything when I told her that she was too extreme about the thought that some people will like her old name. I also pointed out that she ASKED the friend why she was surprised and all the friend was is honest. I told her she has the name she chose now but it's not healthy to be so irrationally angry over this.\n\nMy sister didn't take it well and I feel like I should have seen this coming.

The reason I might be TA is because this is possibly just a sore subject for her since she strongly disliked her old name and did not know at the time what name she wanted in it's place. Maybe having people like the old name brings back some weird feelings for her. So it might be insensitive for me to say what I did.

Some are more unusual than others. Once people know the name, they seem to move on. I like the name Lark, and obviously your parents did too. However, they supported her name change.

I wonder if she\u2019s questioning her decision to change her name and wants affirmation. I gave my daughter a timeless name. Unfortunately, it was extremely popular the year she was born, and there were always several girls with the same name. She unofficially changed her name in elementary school, and now that\u2019s what almost everyone calls her.

So this is pretty individual, and it is safe to say that OP's sister has bigger issues than a name.", "I'm not trying to compare our situations.

But her hatred for her old name has been clear for years now. \n\nSomeone mentioned and I have thought before that she might feel upset that I didn't agree to change my name with her. She wanted me to and it's possible she internalized some negative feelings about me not wanting to do the same. \n\nOr maybe she's more sensitive around me because she knows I love both the names and feels like it's an insult to her or something? I'm not sure.

I have a very common name because dad chose mine and he prefers common names. So I never had many difficulties with my name. Still love it too. I don\u2019t know.

I suppose it most likely is because she feels kind of betrayed that you didn\u2019t want to change yours as well (understandably).", "I have asked her why and she said it never felt right to her and she hated it.

Your sister needs to own up to her decisions, you didn't owe her anything and you didn't abandon by liking your own name.", "Perhaps she just really feels such a strong desire to \"fit in\" and \"be normal\". But I personally love both names, and I can't imagine wanting to fit in so badly that you hate on your parents to that degree just for what they named you. That's extreme, even obsessive almost (almost like there's some level of self loathing mixed in). And it doesn't appear that you were even really harsh or anything when you told her that. I think you were right, but regardless, you are not responsible for her happiness. And you don't have to answer to her if she can't get over her name. That's only her problem.\nNTA", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, je suis pas Verlaine..", "It used to be popular in France and Germany due to an old story \"the singing spinging lark\" in which a prince is turned into a bird called a lark and his princess follows him so when the curse lifts they can be together.
