My sister used to be Lark and I'm Indigo (named after the plant). Our mom changed her name to a nature name when she was 19. For our parents our names needed to be easy to say and spell but they wanted uncommon names. My sister was never super fond of her name. But around the age of 16 she got really annoyed by her name and told our parents she wanted to change it. They offered her support and asked if she wanted to change it then or wait. She decided to change her name then but couldn't decide what she wanted to be so she waited. She ended up changing her name at 20 to a more common and classic/timeless name. Think Emily or Elizabeth. At the time she changed her name my sister said we should both change our names and send a message to our parents that they fucked up. I told her I loved my name so wouldn't be changing it. She asked me if I didn't want an ordinary name and I said no.\n\nFast forward to today and my sister met up with an old friend of hers from school. This friend was not around when my sister changed her name. So when they first met up she was still calling her Lark. My sister corrected her and the friend accepted it. My sister came to my house the very next day and said that her friend had acted so surprised to hear she changed her name. She asked the friend why and the friend said she always thought we had the coolest names and she was always so jealous and it surprised her that she didn't like the name.\n\nWhile my sister was at my house she got so angry about what her friend had said. She even took me aback with the venom she spoke with. She was like how could anyone prefer Lark to \"current name\" and why would anyone be jealous of a dumb name like it. She told me she despises when people compliment the name or when she has to correct people who don't know her name today.\n\nThis isn't the first time my sister got annoyed with people who were shocked that she changed her name and it's not the first time she has admitted wanting to yell in the face of someone who complimented her old name. This time was the most angry she got though. But it has been a thing for 5 years now.\n\nMy sister kept ranting away and then she started saying our parents were shitty parents who only thought of themselves and not us. I told her she needed to calm down because she didn't like her name and they supported her in changing it. But I love my name and our parents made no mistake in naming me. She told me I probably loved her old name too and also don't understand her changing it and she was starting to say fuck me and everything when I told her that she was too extreme about the thought that some people will like her old name. I also pointed out that she ASKED the friend why she was surprised and all the friend was is honest. I told her she has the name she chose now but it's not healthy to be so irrationally angry over this.\n\nMy sister didn't take it well and I feel like I should have seen this coming.

The reason I might be TA is because this is possibly just a sore subject for her since she strongly disliked her old name and did not know at the time what name she wanted in it's place. Maybe having people like the old name brings back some weird feelings for her. So it might be insensitive for me to say what I did.

Some are more unusual than others. Once people know the name, they seem to move on. I like the name Lark, and obviously your parents did too. However, they supported her name change.

I wonder if she\u2019s questioning her decision to change her name and wants affirmation. I gave my daughter a timeless name. Unfortunately, it was extremely popular the year she was born, and there were always several girls with the same name. She unofficially changed her name in elementary school, and now that\u2019s what almost everyone calls her. Occasionally, people (mostly relatives) call her by her birth name, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother her.\n\nEdited to add: She should consider herself lucky the Zappas aren\u2019t her parents.", "NTA.

But her hatred for her old name has been clear for years now. \n\nSomeone mentioned and I have thought before that she might feel upset that I didn't agree to change my name with her. She wanted me to and it's possible she internalized some negative feelings about me not wanting to do the same. \n\nOr maybe she's more sensitive around me because she knows I love both the names and feels like it's an insult to her or something?

I have a very common name because dad chose mine and he prefers common names. So I never had many difficulties with my name. Still love it too. I don\u2019t know. We live by a name for so many years we become accustomed to it, we have the right to love it and feels it is us. \n\nNevertheless, your sister has the right to hate her old name (or yours) but she\u2019s an AH for being so loud about it and trying to make you change your name.

We're opposites in taste.", "Me too, Lark Voorhies.", "But she obviously has issues with the name. But I love a good plot twist.", "Yes! I know of a couple of little Lark's now! The name has gained some popularity.", "Lark is my Stardew Valley farmer name. It's so pretty. Uncommon but not in a weird way like many uncommon names are. If Wren and Robin are names, why shouldn't Lark?", "So everyone says. I am starting to wonder if I should watch the movie", "I am from EU and I honestly don\u2019t remember ever seeing that. No, I am probably just old", "How tf do you pronounce that? Abcede?", "Could something have happened with the wider family? \n\nIt could also be something she's perceived happening and is sore about it. \n\nAre you close? Have a sleepover with wine, comfort food, fave movies, and gently check in with her.", "Oh I definitely love both! It's just that Lark somehow kinda speaks to me. Probably because I have a bird name that I love.", "To each their own. I like it a lot.", "ikr thats what it reminds me of too", "Ok well that's even more dumb lol", "> For me the word association is first \u201cto fool around\u201d and secondly the bird, but I would get used to it\n\nFor me, it's \"Studebaker\", but I'm a child of the '60s.", "It means be playful... Not put dogsht in someones bed.", "It was a long running sitcom.", "Absidy.  Kinda sounds like Cassidy but with no C and more Abs.", "I remember a book before the name gained traction, the main character's name was Abcdef ghijk, and her first name was pronounced Ab-Steph, but idk about one's with out an f at the end", "I love that! I'm so happy that nature names and bird names are becoming more widely used. Lark even ranked in the US in the 1880s/1870s as well. It wasn't SUPER popular but it was there and I find that cool that, while not ranked right now, the name gets used a little more today.", "Do you know how many kids are named Dick or Richard in the UK, just leave the shit take at home", "> Lark is used commonly\n\nThe last time I came across the word lark in this  context was probably an Enid Blyton novel. What's your social and geographical background that you hear it commonly?\n\nIt's not a common synonym for joke either. Behind the bird, which was my first thought, the primary use is to denote a fun activity or an adventure. Sometimes a bit of a cheeky one. But the origin of the word is to play. \n\nI'm sure that at some point in time it has been used as a term for a joke as an extension of play, but that doesn't make it the word's primary meaning outside of the bird.", "It's also a bird. I never even knew it meant joke.", "A thought I had is we can say \u201coh that\u2019s a cute name\u201d but it\u2019s a passing thought as we read a thread. But I wonder what it\u2019s actually like to live with that name. Maybe it\u2019s more challenging than we might consider in a temporary sense", "The Clarks, Marks, and Kirks of this world applaud the stretching you're doing here.", "What kinda logic is this? Are you saying people will bully a kid named Jack because it\u2019s short and harsh?", "Larks are specifically known for their complex and extensive songs. Even their alarm calls are pretty.\n\nIf your phonological argument held any water we'd have an army of Marks changing their name the second they were 18. We don't.", "Maybe but with all the unusual names today it\u2019s hard to imagine how it would be that challenging. A teacher on another thread just posted like 4 way out there names in her class this year. I think those kids would say Lark is quit tame. Nature names also seem to be more in vogue now. I know a couple Rivers. Honestly, parents just do the best they can with names. Your kid might love it or hate it. These parents sound super supportive though in they let her change her name. Honestly, the parents sound like really cool people.", "The people who have used her old name were not aware she had changed it. Everyone who knows calls her by the new name.", "Did we read the same post?? Where on earth did OP say that people were \u201cconstantly\u201d referring to her by her old name and praising it? The only person in this story who called her the old name was a friend who had no idea that she had changed it. Once she was informed of the name change, she just said ok and addressed her as that. The only way she could have avoided calling the sister by her old name altogether is if she was psychic.", "Where is that?"]}
