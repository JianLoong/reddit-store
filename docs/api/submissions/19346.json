I booked an appointment with a tattoo artist I love for the end of June while she is in my hometown. I\u2019m leaving at the start of July to return to school across the country, so there was a narrow window of time in which our schedules overlapped. I booked the appointment for one of her flash tattoos and put down a $100 deposit.\n\nA few days ago she emailed me saying she had pushed my appointment back to mid-July because the studio she wanted wouldn\u2019t be available until July and the city she\u2019s currently in has a better setup for her new puppy. I emailed her back telling her I was a big fan, good luck on the new studio, but that I wouldn\u2019t be in town for the appointment. Additionally, I asked for my deposit back, because I put down my deposit for a certain date and time that she was no longer offering. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t emailed me back but has continued to post on her social media. I\u2019m unsure at this point if she will reply or if I will get my deposit back. Was this a rude request to make? From my point of view, the scheduling error is on the part of the studio, and I don\u2019t want to pay $100 for a tattoo that I cannot receive. On the other hand, she stresses a lot on her social media that deposits are non-refundable which may be why she\u2019s ignoring my request.

Non-refundable deposits are there to protect the provider, but if the provider can't provide you should not be accountable for that. Don't take shit from people or orgs who try to take your money and refuse to refund it due to their own lack of organizational skills.", "NTA.   Error from her side, not yours. Non-refundable only applies when the buyer cancels it. In this situation, she is the one who is not providing you with the service/ changed the appointment date.", "NTA.  The deposit is there to make sure she isn't wasting time holding a spot open.

She should give you your deposit back no problem, it\u2019s plenty of notice and not a large custom design she spent time working on. You can always call her studio or the studio she will be guesting at, leave a message and your number. Let them know the situation and best way to get back to you. Any ethical tattooer will gladly refund your deposit.", "NTA you didn't cancel or change your appointment they did without consulting you to see if you was available. Get your money back.

I would suggest emailing her again and explain you are a student and that you are returning to school so cant make the new appointment time and as a student, money is tight and would appreciate a refund. If she doens\u2018t respond, maybe reach out through social media. If that doesn\u2019t work and you paid with a credit/debit card or Paypal,  you can dispute it since she changed the scheduled date. Keep a copy of all your correspondence. A few years ago, zi bought tixs for a comedy show through eBay and the show was cancelled. I sent several messages to the seller that the show was cancelled and they never answered me or gave a refund, eBay was unable to help since it was over 45 days from purchase (it has now been changed to 45 days after the event). I had used a Discover card and they told me that the  seller/merchant could not take Discover for any online payments until the issue was resolved. Of course, then the seller emailed me wanting to \u201cwork things out\u201d since they couldnt process any orders with Discover as payment, I did get my refund and hope you do too.", "This. Exactly. \n\nNTA.", "The Better Business Bureau has no power. It's just yelp for old people. There's nothing wrong with contacting them, but OP would probably be better served leaving reviews online where prospective tattoo buyers are more likely to see it.", ">I know you usually don't refund deposits however I'm leaving the country so I won't be able to attend\n\nOP, don't put that in writing. It sounds like an admission that you're the one in the wrong.

I had bought tixs through ebay for a show that was eventually cancelled and the seller would not return my emails or refund the $. I was able to dispute it and the credit card comoany told me that the seller/merchant would not be able to take anymore purchases using that card type (Discover).
