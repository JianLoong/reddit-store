He did not specify that the phone has changed display through a 3rd party, and I only got to know it when I got home after the transaction - he was super shady throughout (He only accepted payment in cash, and also immediately deleted the listing after the deal. Also, when I asked for a ss of the 'About' page, he sent me a cropped ss as he did not want me to see the 'unknown part' message). The phone's condition and camera everything were functioning fine though (at least that was what I thought atp in time) But ya, stupid me didn't thought much about all those red flags until I got home. However, I also knew it was my mistake for not checking the phone thoroughly, so I did not hound the seller for a refund and instead decided to just take responsibility for my own lapses by selling it off. I also knew it was quite impossible he would agree to a refund given his shady attitude.\n\nThe unauthentic display part bothered me quite a bit, so I decided to sell it off back on the platform at the same price. But this time, I made sure I was transparent about the fact that the phone has changed display as I did not want someone else to have the same negative experience as I had. I provided screenshots of the settings page, the unknown display message, serial number, IMED, etc. A keen buyer came along, asked me many questions about the phone in which I tried my best to answer to my best knowledge of the phone, and I also made it known to him that the display was changed in which he acknowledged.\n\nCame the day of the deal, I had him checked the phone thoroughly. He told me he has an iPhone that also has a changed display but did not affect functionality so he was okay with buying another one that has a changed display too for his wife. He tested the camera, typing the phone, scrolling, checked the settings page, crosschecked the box's serial number to that in the 'About' page of the phone, etc. Once that's done, he told me he will buy it and I was happy that I get to earn back my money in an honest manner.\n\nHowever, a few days later, he texted me saying that the phone's Face ID is not working (which istg I really did not know of) and from the looks of it, he wants a refund. But I personally deep down do not want to give a refund as it was not on purpose that I sold the phone to him knowing the Face ID does not work - I was as transparent as I could be to my best knowledge of the phone's condition. Also, I feel that I shouldn't bear the consequence of him not checking the phone thoroughly as well (since I bore my own from the initial seller).

It is your job as a seller to thoroughly inspect your shit before you sell it... and you did, to the best of your ability.  And then you let the buyer inspect it to the best of his ability.  That's about as much as a guarantee as anyone can expect when they buy used items in private transactions.  \nNow, as it stands, you and the customer both confirmed that the phone was in workign condition when he purchased it, and you have *no evidence* that this customer didn't break the phone himself or that he didn't simply get cold feet.", "NTA.

There is an inherent risk in purchasing a product from them, which is reflected in a much lower price.

Do you think you can get a refund on yard sale items too?", "Well said.", "There is also always an implied warranty in all sales that the item sold works unless otherwise disclosed.", "This wasn't a yard sale", "In no way is that a thing lol", "It was disclosed\u2026", "It was an online marketplace.

My Face ID on iPhone 13 Pro has not worked properly in months, same for other iPhone users I know.", "NTA but you need to check thoroughly what your obligations are on the platform you sold on.

First off, guy selling it wanted only cash, and deleted ad immediately after it was sold.  I mean, what did you expect him to do?  I would only accept cash from a stranger, and wouldn't want to continue to get messages after the item was sold.  While the SS of the about page was cropped, I would have checked that out at the exchange.\n\nYou wound up not liking what you bought and turned around and sold it for a wash.  I'm OK with that (depending on the price -the cheaper it was, the more I'm OK with it.)\n\nGuy you sold it to isn't an AH for asking for his money back, and you're not an AH for not giving it back, as all private party sales are as-is.  Now if he starts hounding you about it, that may change my opinion.", "NTA. It sounds like you fully disclosed that the phone's display had been changed, and he checked it out before buying. It is generally understood that buying a used item is sold \"AS IS\" unless guarantees or refunds are promised in the ad.", "It\u2018s pretty common knowledge that Apple ties FaceID to an original display and disables when unauthorized displays are used.
