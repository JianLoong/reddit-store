She has been going to therapy since, and we started marriage counseling during Covid. Reason for marriage counseling was because she thought I was pushing her too hard to go back to work before her and her therapist thought she was ready. I tried to explain many times that was not my intent but realistically speaking for me to keep up with expenses, and retirement contributions I pretty much have to take on extra shifts which sometimes clock in over 18 hours a day, and on average I have been pulling 84 hour weeks. I have been doing this since she stopped working. \n\nWe recently had a fight cause I had an extremely rough week and had the conversation again about her going back to work. She opened up with the same line she always does \"We do not feel it is the right time yet, she feels I have made great progress and if I rush it I run the risk of losing it.\" The we being her and therapist. I told her I really do not give a fuck what her therapist has to say, and I am sick of you hiding behind her words whenever this topic comes up. \n\nShe started to cry, telling me she does not like being this way either and I am belittling her due to suffering from mental health issues. I replied saying I do not indeed to belittle you or not take your issues seriously problem is I am running myself ragged, and what happens if I have a mental break? Do you think I will have the luxury of not working? No, I will have to push through my demons. \n\nShe said her therapist warned her this would happen sooner or later I would try to manipulate her into doing something she was not ready to do. This is when I really lost it and just let it all out. I did not say anything kind. I told her she insults me for thinking what I am doing is manipulation. I told her I am working these extra shifts so she can be home and bullshit playing games. I told during this entire time you have not even made an effort to improve on certain skills, I told her she can still not cook to save her life, and that was sick of coming home after 12 or 18 hour days just make us dinner cause her idea of making dinner is pretty a pre-made in the oven or ordering out. Among other things, that said she stormed out the house crying yelling and shouting how I am a piece of shit, and rather see myself comfortable verse her getting better. \n\nSo here I am, I do not feel at the core I am wrong, and while what I said was harsh I think it did have to be said. So reddit was I the asahole here?\n\nHey I appreciate the replies, going to leave a quick update to answer and clarify what I can. I apologize if I miss something. Thank nonetheless. \n\nYes, I have been to a couple of sessions with my wife and her therapist. Tbh it largely felt I was getting ganged up on. My wife brought up how I was always tired, so I explained I am working harder to maintain our home. When I suggested part time work would allow me to work less, their counter suggestion was to cut things like saving for retirement, and hold off on paying off debt, and tackle such things after my wife gets better. Then I suggest renting out the house to cover the mortgage and we downsize to an apartment. Her therapist said such a drastic change to her environment could have a negative impact on her depression, and advises against such major life changing events. \n\nDuring another session she brought up how my suggestion she tries cooking to save is money so we do not order so much. She felt insulted because in terms of money coming in I am making slightly more then our combined income, and she was able to cover her expenses so she does not understand why we are having such a hard time. I was honest, it has less to do with money per-se and more so the fact the amount of hours I have to work to maintain the income. I told her I pretty much am working two fulltime jobs. The cooking or doing things around the house was dropped fairly quickly and became a critic on how i cannot mange money since I am making more, yet I never had issues when she was working with how she spent. \n\nMore or less every session became what I could do to help my wife, and I get it her therapist has to look out for my wife and generally my concerns are small compared to my wife's. My wife is not a huge fan of our marriage counselor because she offers suggestions that go against her therapist.\n\nMy friend has also suggested I speak with a lawyer to see exactly what my options are. After reading many of the comments and thinking back on everything I think I am going to do that. I love my wife and I know she is sick but I am good to no one if i keep up this pace.\n\nFinal Edit: \n\nThank you so much for the replies and advice, was a slow morning only had one field call so I was looking over the thread with a colleague and close friend. After talking I have decided to put in a request for two weeks vacation. During that time I am going to relax with my friends play some Baldurs Gate 3 and also get my shit together. Going to speak with a lawyer and see what my options are cause I was young and dumb and much of her debt is mine because I cosigned and have a joint account. I will go to the doctor for the first time in four years and make sense everything is still working as it should. During this time my friend said I could crash at their place, so I am going to take him up on that offer. \n\nThis will be my final post here though, going over this I made this post for all the wrong reasons. This is something that should not have been posted publicly and I was petty for that. Even so, I thank everyone because a lot of what was said was what I needed to hear. I do not have much in terms of a family both my parents passed. Thanks for the tough love. Something has to change, and if my wife is unable I have to do it. I am young, I should be enjoying my life I am not even 30 yet as my friend said. I aged so much in these last five years, it is scary my friend showed me pictures from before all this happened. I want to go back to the person I was then. \n\nI agree I was the asshole for what I said, but I do not regret it it was a wake-up call I needed.", "created_utc": 1692001151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qol0m/aita_for_telling_my_wife_it_is_time_she_went_back/", "score": 16913, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Certainly she's not cooking.\n\nTherapy or not, for the past five years she has basically lived a lifestyle where she gets to relax as much as she wants and it's all subsidized by you. You have my sympathy for that. \n\nBut let's be clear what your options are here. **You cannot force her to work,** either in the paid workforce, or keeping house for you. You can ask, but you cannot force her.\n\n**All you can do is decide whether you're prepared to live with someone who does not pull their weight in this relationship.**\n\nIf you decide you cannot, then you tell her that (not as a threat, not as an ultimatum - simply stating a fact), and you find yourself a lawyer.", "Despite the blow up, I say NTA. You sound burned out and pushed beyond capacity. FIVE YEARS of up to 84 hour weeks? Do you sleep? \n\nIf she can\u2019t go back to teaching, then it\u2019s time to find a different career. \u201cMy therapist said this would happen\u201d sounds like a bigger manipulation tactic than you telling her you are at your limits, but don\u2019t have the luxury of not working as hard as you are. She has all the regard for her own mental health, but no compassion for how her inability to work is making your mental health suffer. \n\nNot to stir the pot here, but is she actually going to a therapist? Like, you know she is attending and talking to a person? I would question a therapist who is claiming she is making progress, but there has been no visible improvement in half a decade.", "OK, this really resonates with me because I'm currently in recovery from a burn out. I don't like to make comparisons because maybe your wife's recovery is taking longer but 5 years seems excessive. I'm in therapy and my therapist has never said any of the things to me that your wife is parroting to you.\n\nI've been encouraged to clean my house, cook meals, even do some volunteer work because the worst thing that you can do is just sit around doing nothing. You do indeed need to take some rest and let your mind and body recover but doing nothing can lead to you getting stuck in a rut that you can't get out of (sounds like your wife might even be there).\n\nAll I can say is that I think you're NTA. You're probably burnt out yourself after dealing with all of this for 5 years. Should you have shouted at your wife? Possibly not but you're a human being and you can only take so much. I actually don't think it would be unreasonable of you to end this relationship if this is what you're going to have to deal with for the rest of your life. You deserve a decent life as well. Good luck with everything OP xxx", "NTA\nAsk her what about *your* mental AND physical health?\nAlso, are you sure the therapist is actually validating everything like this? Sounds a lot like your wife is just saying \"but my therapist says...\" to sort of add weight to what she says. And to accuse you of manipulation is ridiculous.", "NTA. Mental health is important, but damn she hasn't done ANYTHING?? A cooked meal is the *least* I could do if I weren't working and my spouse was. There's no way she's that crippled to the point where she can look at someone working 84 hours a week and imply they're the selfish one. Like this account, make her a throwaway too.", "NTA\n\nIf I'd spent the last five years pulling in 84 hour weeks, I think I would've snapped a long time ago. So I really cannot blame you for losing it with your wife.\n\n>I am running myself ragged, and what happens if I have a mental break? Do you think I will have the luxury of not working? No, I will have to push through my demons.\n\nThere will come a point eventually where you simply won't have a choice to 'push through' a mental break; you will *physically* become unable to carry on. \n\nI think you're at a turning point in your marriage. Your wife has watched you work insane hours for five years and shows no signs of even thinking about returning to work and taking the pressure off you. She is expecting you to continue like this for an indefinite amount of time and that is **not** okay. Either she has a *really* shitty therapist who isn't helping her at all, or she is being dishonest with you about about the therapist is saying in order to get out of returning to work. \n\nWhatever's going on, OP you **need** to prioritise your own health **now** before it's too late.", "NTA. It may be time to call this an unsustainable relationship and let it go.", "NTA\n\nDont burn yourself to warm others, at least not for 5 freaking years.", " NTA. You need to consider if this relationship is still for you.", "NTA. Sitting at home doing nothing is never going to make her recover. All the mental health professionals I have had have always stressed the importance of spending your time productively and that includes employment. Your wife is taking advantage of you and she doesn't seem to care what this is costing you.", "NTA. You are basically working yourself to the bone, yet your wife is still not improving in any skills (or so you claimed) for her mental health break. As much as mental health is important, she should see it from your perspective too. It is so bold of her to say that you are seeking for your comfort rather than hers, when you have not been comfortable for the entire time you had extra work.", "NTA. A year, maybe two are okay, but after 5 years he should have been healed enough to working anything to support her husband. She is really hiding behind something. You need to call it quits, she is using you. She doesn't have to go back to work, so she isn't. Don't end yourself just to please her. 84 hours a week will burn you out soon, I am surprised it hasn't yet. I work half of that and sometimes it's too much. You probably don't have kids or something like that, right? You need to take care of yourself now, if that means divorcing her, you have to do it. She has a therapist, she can rely on, so she should be fine mentally. Leave, before it burns you out.", "Her therapist is the biggest asshole here. NTA even with the blow up because it sounds like you have discussed many, many viable options and they were all shot down. In the end there is nothing you can do to fix this situation, she has to be the one putting in the work. Unfortunately she has demonstrated, repeatedly, that she is not willing or able to do that. I cannot even imagine the sheer overwhelming amount of resentment you must be feeling. \n\nIf she's willing to try something different maybe she could see a different therapist and try a different kind of therapy. CBT has really helped me personally with work related PTSD but idk what is most appropriate for your wife. For reference, I was able to go back to work after 3 months. 5 years is crazy, maybe literally. \n\nThe real question here is, what are you going to do if she refuses to change?", "INFO: you mention marriage counseling, is this still going on? Also, have you gone to any therapy appointments with her and/or suggested joining one? \n\nIt\u2019s certainly fair that after almost 5 years you feel a burnout of sorts, married or not, the hours and time you\u2019re putting in are not sustainable for anyone. Attending a session would probably be the better step than resorting to an outburst and saying unkind things. It\u2019s also possible this isn\u2019t the right therapist if you don\u2019t see any real forward momentum but she can\u2019t/doesn\u2019t see that.", "NTA. \n\nYour Wife isn\u2019t going back to work. \n\nIf she has had five years of therapy and she isn\u2019t back in work, then she has absolutely no intentions of ever doing it. Five years is a ridiculous amount of time to be off work for a \u2018mental breakdown\u2019. Is her therapist real? \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s spent the past few years gaslighting you and emotionally manipulating you, whilst she simultaneously works you to death. You\u2019re killing yourself with 18 hour days for her and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the villain in every story she tells. Has she ever thanked you for supporting her? Does she do anything nice for you? I\u2019d bet not. \n\nIn fact, I\u2019d bet that after your argument the other day, her \u2018therapist\u2019 has told her that she\u2019s had her progress set back so much and it\u2019s all your fault\u2026 Blah blah blah. \n\nThis woman has trapped you in a financially abusive relationship and is quite content with working you to death. She enjoys being unemployed and not lifting a finger to help, while you slave 18 hour days and then have to get home and cook. She forced you into marriage counselling to victimise herself and blame you for pushing her into work and ruining the relationship. \n\nShe calls you a manipulator, plays the victim, says that you only care about yourself when you\u2019ve worked 84 hour weeks for the past 5 years\u2026 Dude this woman is toxic, abusive, and you need to get away from her. She is happy with you working yourself into an early grave, she cares about your money, not your well-being. She expects you to cater to her every whim and provide for her, and the second you say you can\u2019t take it any more, you\u2019re a piece of shit\u2026 \n\nIn my country a 37 hour working week is fairly average. You\u2019re working over double that. She doesn\u2019t appreciate it, and in fact, blames you and insults you because you can\u2019t do it anymore. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how angry I am for you. If you don\u2019t slow down you\u2019re going to work yourself into an early grave, for a woman who, from what you\u2019ve told us, clearly doesn\u2019t care about you.\n\nI beg of you, please get a good Solicitor/Lawyer and DIVORCE THIS WOMAN. You are in an abusive relationship. She will attempt to manipulate and emotionally blackmail you forever if you don\u2019t stop it now. \n\nI can\u2019t say it enough, you are being abused massively, and she has no intention of getting better as long as she can subjugate you into being her cash cow. You know she isn\u2019t trying to improve herself, she doesn\u2019t try and make your life even a little bit easier by learning to cook\u2026 You\u2019re slaving yourself for her and she does not appreciate you. \n\nPlease please please divorce her. You deserve so much better.", "NTA. It's natural to feel overwhelmed when carrying a heavy financial load for an extended period.", "NTA you are mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted and she does not care. Time to ask yourself if this is truly what you want for your life going forward .

She seems like a lost cause, the we she has is not with you. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nAlso there are a few questions for your wife's therapist. Did her therapist actually tell her you would try to manipulate her to go back to work?

It may be helpful for your wife to hear your concerns and difficulties with a third party present, who can mediate and re-position things. \n\nIt sounds like she doesn\u2019t fully appreciate or understand your struggles.

If she cannot make money, the responsibility of doing whatever she can falls on her. She should cook and clean and handle everything that has to be handled to the best of her fucking ability. Can't go back to teaching? Sell your feet pictures. Whatever, anything.\n\nMaybe the right solution is her becoming an online tutor? She would still be able to stay home and it would bring in some money at least.\n\nIt's not fair on you. This isn't about you being comfortable, this is about you being overworked to death.\n\nI have a physical disability and it's very severe, from an illness, so of course depression and mental health problems come with it. I have insane problem with mobility and can't really work like a normal person. I've been looking for work online for a while now.\n\nAnd consider me - barely able to move, always in physical pain, always. I left the house yesterday for two hours. I have hair that reaches to middle of my back. When I came home, the effort of just walking around some fucking shops is such a workout for me, my hair, entire head, not just crown, but every strand, was dripping with sweat. That's how hard my disability is.\n\nAnd I feel awful when I don't cook. There's so much I don't do. I do everything I can, but so much is left on him, I feel awful about this, all the time. This isn't fair on him.\n\nThe least I can do is cook and clean as much as I can. I don't do it as much as is needed - but we didn't have this argument. Why? Because altough he is overworked and exhausted, he knows I did my 100% and it's that fucking small. You're angry with her because she isn't putting in effort and she doesn't seem to care about you. And those are very, very good reasons to be angry with her.\n\nMental health problems, even disability, don't give you a blank slate to do nothing. She can do stuff. If she hates cooking, she should meal prep, so she can actually buy those bags for oven, get chicken, spices and make it in the oven, there you go, homemade dinner. For the first 20 minutes of chicken put in the oven the tray with salted peppered vegetables like broccoli and there you go, second element of dinner. Total preparation time - 30 minutes for a disabled chronically in pain person. Salads we make ourselves to our taste. So I cannot blame you one bit.\n\nFeel free to show her this comment.\n\nAnd look yourself - not her - for online tutoring gigs in your area so you know if this can even be done and how much she could make. If you work 14-18 hour days it sounds like even if she did 6 hours of tutoring a week it would still ease the financial burden.

Sorry that you\u2019ve been conditioned to believe that you need to run yourself ragged just to be given the respect of life like any other person. Genuinely\u2026this is not healthy nor kind to yourself. My partner has never, not once, made me feel like I needed to take on physically painful tasks just to be on some sort of level playing field. You don\u2019t owe anyone that kind of suffering, I hope you realise that. One\u2019s ability to work or be productive is not what makes them a better person or worthy of respect.

I don't want anyone reading my words to think that they have to run themselves rugged. Or that if their partner requires it, it's ok. This is a very important point. People are different and situations and relationships are different. What works for one person won't work for another. Problem with OP's wife is that she isn't putting in effort. And reality is that our ability to do things doesn't decide our worth - but our effort into doing whatever we can, especially if it's hard for us, this does show how much we care about our significant other.

She has been going to therapy since, and we started marriage counseling during Covid. Reason for marriage counseling was because she thought I was pushing her too hard to go back to work before her and her therapist thought she was ready. I tried to explain many times that was not my intent but realisticly speaking for me to keep up with expenses, and retirement contributions I pretty much have to take on extra shifts which sometimes clock in over 18 hours a day, and on average I have been pulling 84 hour weeks. I have been doing this since she stopped working. \n\nWe recently had a fight cause I had an extremely rough week and had the conversation again about her going back to work. She opened up with the same line she always does \"We do not feel it is the right time yet, she feels I have made great progress and if I rush it I run the risk of losing it.\" The we being her and therapist. I told her I really do not give a fuck what her therapist has to say, and I am sick of you hiding behind her words whenever this topic comes up. \n\nShe started to cry, telling me she does not like being this way either and I am belittling her due to suffering from mental health issues. I replied saying I do not indeed to belittle you or not take your issues seriously problem is I am running myself ragged, and what happens if I have a mental break? Do you think I will have the luxury of not working? No, I will have to push through my demons. \n\nShe said her therapist warned her this would happen sooner or later I would try to manipulate her into doing something she was not ready to do. This is when I really lost it and just let it all out. I did not say anything kind. I told her she insults me for thinking what I am doing is manipulation. I told her I am working these extra shifts so she can be home and bullshit playing games. I told during this entire time you have not even made an effort to improve on certain skills, I told her she can still not cook to save her life, and that was sick of coming home after 12 or 18 hour days just make us dinner cause her idea of making dinner is pretty a pre-made in the oven or ordering out. Among other things, that said she stormed out the house crying yelling and shouting how I am a piece of shit, and rather see myself comfortable verse her getting better. \n\nSo here I am, I do not feel at the core I am wrong, and while what I said was harsh I think it did have to be said. So reddit was I the asahole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.  She doesn't have to go back to teaching, shecan go back to a stressfree position.  I had a really difficult time in 2015, which ended in a friend no longer being here due to DV, her ex is in prison for life, I lost the ability to cope with anything except things like caring for myself, anything that caused a little stress and I lost it.  I took 6mths off work and then went back into an easy stressfree job to slowly adjust.  You are killing yourself, and she doesn't seem grateful at all.  If she hasn't improved enough in 5 years then she needs to get a new therapist because this one isn't helping.  Or it could be she has no intention of ever going back in which case you have some serious decisions to make, you shouldn't have to work the hours you are, you cannot maintain it longterm for your own health. If my husband was working those hours continually I would be doing anything I could to help.", "Nta\n\nWhat about your mental health.\n\nAfter 5 years of 80+ hour weeks I think its time for you to go to your own therapist.

Honestly, teaching is tough even without mental health issues, but there must be shops or restaurants in your area looking for staff? This would be a lower pressure field of work, it might help her rebuild her confidence and contribute to expenses.", "NTA she is using her mental health as an excuse to be lazy. She \"had a breakdown\" - what diagnosis was she given that could justify 5 years off of work?", "NTA, I experienced burnout last year and had 4 months off- it is an awful experience. I went back to work on a phased return which seemed to work for me in that it helped with the feeling of being overwhelmed by going back. Perhaps this could be a compromise for her to test the waters- go back part time with whatever she is comfortable starting with, and build up slowly from there- this way she has time to adjust and assess how she feels / if she can cope. Not working from 2018 is a very long time, I could understand how many it feels daunting and overwhelming to go back to work. That being said, the longer she stays away completely the harder it will be. Additionally- therapist sounds like a red flag, someone pulling 18hrs a day for so many years is likely also burned out and not trying to manipulate anyone here. Therapist shouldn\u2019t be dismissing other people\u2019s boundaries.", "NTA. it's been 5 years, if she cared at all she could have looked at working 1-2 days a week in a job and gradually built up at her own speed. But she didn't. She's happy living off your hard work and gaslighting you and her therapist is enabling her. \n\nAs a kid we had a family friend with the same dynamic. He was the breadwinner and she supplemented their income with dolls she would make (she was very creative) he had a work related breakdown and didn't go back to work. This was like 10+ years before we knew them. She would work her ass off making these dolls to support their family to the point she started getting arthritis in her hands in her early 40's. \n\nHe didn't care, he was happy spending his days smoking and drinking and watching porn (us kids accidentally found his porn folder on the family pc.... a  very awkward day...).", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with mental health issues all my life.

Christ, even working part time would be a benefit. But it\u2019s not fair to you to have to work 12-18+ hour days and come home without a warm meal to greet you. \n\nPersonally, it\u2019s my philosophy that if I can\u2019t contribute financially, I will be damn sure to contribute in some other way.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you and your wife are going through this.", "NTA.  She\u2019s an albatross at this point.  Your shouting at her is probably the healthiest thing you\u2019ve done for yourself in years.  I\u2019d separate.

Nah. I couldn't live like that unless my salary was crazy high to truly comfortably support all of us without working overtime.\n\nI'd honestly leave any partner that didn't contribute, but that's just me - you do what you feel is right OP, but you're not an ass.", "NTA your at ur breaking point", "NTA and you would not be out of line to give her the ultimatum that if she does not start pulling her weight, you will end the relationship.

This therapist is clearly incredibly unprofessional since she's putting words in your wife's mouth by telling her that you'd try and manipulate her. Honestly, the therapist needs to be reported. Especially as it sounds like your wife isn't actually getting the help she needs and is instead being kept on the hook, presumably so the therapist can keep getting paid to see her.\n\nThe other AH is the corrupt system that fails to provide adequate financial support for people struggling with mental health issues. You should not be having to take on all those extra hours just because your wife can't work. She should be getting help from the system.\n\nI'm not gonna call your wife an AH, because as frustrating as it is, she can't help being mentally ill. She's in a vulnerable place, she's clearly very sensitive, and her therapist is taking advantage of her condition. It must suck for her to know that her mental health issues are such a burden on you, whilst also knowing that she's not in a healthy place where she's able to work or even do basic things around the house. Her self-esteem must be so low. I've been there, it's awful. That doesn't excuse her calling you names, but I expect she wasn't in her right frame of mind, and was lashing out because she felt ashamed. \n\nI'm also not gonna call you an AH. You admit that you said some unkind things to her, which I'm sure were very hurtful for her to hear, but you're exhausted. I can't imagine how tough it is for you having to pull such long shifts all the time. So I'm not gonna blame you for snapping, you have so much pressure.\n\nIt's the situation that sucks, and the AH therapist who's taking advantage of your wife.", "ESH.

What if she is doing her best, and this is the very best she can do for the rest of her life? How does your life need to change to accommodate this?  Do you need to reduce your expenses?  Get a smaller place to reduce your rent or mortgage payments? Scale back your retirement goals?   Find a better-paying job?  Do you reach the reluctant conclusion that you can no longer live with her if this is the best she can do? \n\nAnd in the meantime, what can you do to take the pressure off?  Do you have any people your life who can cook for us every so often, or help with household chores and yard work so you can get more rest?\n\nSeek good professional advice on all of this, not just from a lawyer, but possibly from a counsellor and/or a financial advisor. \n\nOh her side, she needs to do a different thought experiment.  She needs to ask, what if her current therapy isn't enough for her to reach her full potential?  Would it be helpful to take medication, if she is not already taking it?

I'm sure that even part time would relieve some of your stress.\n\nAsk your wife if you can accompany her to her next therapist appointment.  I just have this feeling, because it has been 5 years, that she probably was given the go ahead to return to work slowly long ago.  Maybe not, but you could hear it straight from the therapist.  If she refuses to let you hear it straight from the therapist, that will tell you that she doesn't want you to know. \n\nPlus, I don't get that in all this time she has been off work she hasn't tried to do anything.

I ended up going to the er that day, and the er recommended me to a partial hospitalization program (PHP). During that program for a few months I went to therapy sessions like they were school. Almost 8 hours of individual and group therapies every. Single. Day. And you know what I worked my ASS off. I didn\u2019t want to be there, I hated what the breakdown did to me, I never wanted to come near that point again.

After a few months of IOP I graduated from that (got my little coin, yay!), and worked 10-20 hours a week. I stayed there for quite some time until I found myself able to work full time again. \n\nHere I am two-three years later, I\u2019ve been working full time for over a year already, and I have never felt better. I\u2019m here because I worked my ass off and my partner was there every step of the way supporting me. \n\nLong story short I HATED making my partner support me.

Whenever he brings that up, she just talks about how her house isn't finished being built yet.  Her sins here far outweigh her his.

Your wife might not be able to handle teaching but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t do other things. I might not be ready to step into a big 4 consulting firm again but I can sure as heck work at my local surf shop or do dog walking or wash dishes or sell homemade bread.\n\nYou should not have to work a side job because your wife can\u2019t get her act together enough to earn $30 an hour washing dishes for 1 day a week.

She has no intention of letting the gravy train roll out and will continue to do as she is.\n\n\nYou have 2 options if that is the case.\n\n1.You need to seek a good lawyer and talk about your options long term. Divorce is suggested but a divorce lawyer for men that is good at their job is a must. Pay the extra it will be worth it in the long run.

If you refuse to go the lawyer route because you love her and you can't live without her. Start taking away the free ride. Cut the internet, cut the cable, get a service you can watch on your phone if you need the outlet for yourself. Give her an allowance based on what she completes around the house. BASIC living conditions only. Let her know if she wants those things she is going to have to pay for them herself because you need to start living within your household means and working 80+ hours a week alone isn't living within means.

The burn out hit hard, which I blame myself for not better managing my time.  I was new to teaching, new to the area so no real social life, and just spent all my time focused on working.  I would stay at the school lesson planning and grading papers as late as 8 at night multiple times a week.  Eventually I met my husband, and I slowly started to realize I was working way too much.  It took a few years to figure out a better work and home life balance, but by then my husband was transferred to a new duty location.  Leaving the state meant I no longer had a license to teach in the state we were living in.\n\nI ended up becoming a SAHM, and had more kids after that first move to a new state.  Now, instead of being burnt out on working, I'm burnt out on being stuck at home all day with the kids!  Not the type of burn out I was expecting, but a burn out just the same.  Due to the young ages of the kids, my husband being in the military, and our youngest having special needs, going back to work full time isn't an option currently.  At one point we ended up back in the original state where I had a license to teach, so for a short amount of time I was able to work as a substitute teacher.  I loved it.  I only worked on days my husband was able to get time off of work, so he could be home with our youngest as well as deal with the school drop-off and pick-up of the older kids.  I got to pick and chose which substituting jobs I did, so I was able to be sure I worked with the grade level and subject matter I enjoyed the most.  I also LOVED that once the day was over, I was done working.  There was no lesson planning or grading to do.  I just showed up, followed the provided lesson plan, and leave.  We've since moved across the country, again, so I'm no longer in a state I'm licensed to teach in, but once the youngest is finally in school full time I'll work on pursuing getting more substitute teaching work. As of right now, I don't know if I'll ever go back to a full time teaching gig.  Thankfully, while my husband is in the military he makes enough money so I don't need to work.  Once he retires in a few years, that can easily change.  Since our relationship is a partnership, if I need to go back to work full time to help support our family financially, then that's what I'll do.  I'm not going to watch my husband work himself ragged while I sit on my butt all day.\n\nI think OP's wife should look into becoming a substitute teacher.  It will give her the freedom of working as much or as little as she wants, which will allow her to ease back into the work force.  It's also a lot less stressful since she wouldn't have to deal with the extra work of lesson planning and grading that comes with teaching.  She just needs to want to go back to work, which I get the feeling she doesn't based on OP's post.", "Exactly. I feel like too long a break from some things can make it even harder to go back to things. I think a lot of people discovered this during COVID. Especially just being out around other people.

They also had a very strict cancellation policy in our signed contract so I felt locked in to a schedule. I finally was able to reduce frequency but it took a TON of advocating and pushing.

Regardless, you have the right to not work yourself to death.  Good luck to you.", "That's exactly it.

How she never made an effort on any of the steps in order to start a bakery and if she was serious we need to start taking steps sooner than later. I literally told her that if she hate the job so much and around so many negative people I would not get upset or care if she ups and quit. I 100 percent gave her an out to quit her job because I make enough to support us both and explained that as well. She'd complain almost daily, I didn't mind and would let her vent. What happened next I would not of expected at all. \n\nBefore I got done with the chat, she immediately got defensive. Acused me of acussing her of cheating and I got to see the first time she raised her voice and a whole different side of her.

How she ever come to that conclusion of how I accused her of cheating is beyond me. I never even mentioned that word, never said I thought she was, never said I don't trust her. I was explaining it'd be okay if you want to leave a toxic work environment. As a side note I had a very long conversation with the ex husband. Pretty cool dude.
