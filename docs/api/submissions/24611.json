She has been going to therapy since, and we started marriage counseling during Covid. Reason for marriage counseling was because she thought I was pushing her too hard to go back to work before her and her therapist thought she was ready. I tried to explain many times that was not my intent but realistically speaking for me to keep up with expenses, and retirement contributions I pretty much have to take on extra shifts which sometimes clock in over 18 hours a day, and on average I have been pulling 84 hour weeks. I have been doing this since she stopped working. \n\nWe recently had a fight cause I had an extremely rough week and had the conversation again about her going back to work. She opened up with the same line she always does \"We do not feel it is the right time yet, she feels I have made great progress and if I rush it I run the risk of losing it.\" The we being her and therapist. I told her I really do not give a fuck what her therapist has to say, and I am sick of you hiding behind her words whenever this topic comes up. \n\nShe started to cry, telling me she does not like being this way either and I am belittling her due to suffering from mental health issues. I replied saying I do not indeed to belittle you or not take your issues seriously problem is I am running myself ragged, and what happens if I have a mental break? Do you think I will have the luxury of not working? No, I will have to push through my demons. \n\nShe said her therapist warned her this would happen sooner or later I would try to manipulate her into doing something she was not ready to do. This is when I really lost it and just let it all out. I did not say anything kind. I told her she insults me for thinking what I am doing is manipulation. I told her I am working these extra shifts so she can be home and bullshit playing games. I told during this entire time you have not even made an effort to improve on certain skills, I told her she can still not cook to save her life, and that was sick of coming home after 12 or 18 hour days just make us dinner cause her idea of making dinner is pretty a pre-made in the oven or ordering out. Among other things, that said she stormed out the house crying yelling and shouting how I am a piece of shit, and rather see myself comfortable verse her getting better. \n\nSo here I am, I do not feel at the core I am wrong, and while what I said was harsh I think it did have to be said.

Certainly she's not cooking.\n\nTherapy or not, for the past five years she has basically lived a lifestyle where she gets to relax as much as she wants and it's all subsidized by you. You have my sympathy for that. \n\nBut let's be clear what your options are here. **You cannot force her to work,** either in the paid workforce, or keeping house for you. You can ask, but you cannot force her.\n\n**All you can do is decide whether you're prepared to live with someone who does not pull their weight in this relationship.**\n\nIf you decide you cannot, then you tell her that (not as a threat, not as an ultimatum - simply stating a fact), and you find yourself a lawyer.", "Despite the blow up, I say NTA. You sound burned out and pushed beyond capacity. FIVE YEARS of up to 84 hour weeks? Do you sleep? \n\nIf she can\u2019t go back to teaching, then it\u2019s time to find a different career. \u201cMy therapist said this would happen\u201d sounds like a bigger manipulation tactic than you telling her you are at your limits, but don\u2019t have the luxury of not working as hard as you are. She has all the regard for her own mental health, but no compassion for how her inability to work is making your mental health suffer. \n\nNot to stir the pot here, but is she actually going to a therapist? Like, you know she is attending and talking to a person? I would question a therapist who is claiming she is making progress, but there has been no visible improvement in half a decade.", "OK, this really resonates with me because I'm currently in recovery from a burn out. I don't like to make comparisons because maybe your wife's recovery is taking longer but 5 years seems excessive. I'm in therapy and my therapist has never said any of the things to me that your wife is parroting to you.\n\nI've been encouraged to clean my house, cook meals, even do some volunteer work because the worst thing that you can do is just sit around doing nothing. You do indeed need to take some rest and let your mind and body recover but doing nothing can lead to you getting stuck in a rut that you can't get out of (sounds like your wife might even be there).\n\nAll I can say is that I think you're NTA. You're probably burnt out yourself after dealing with all of this for 5 years. Should you have shouted at your wife? Possibly not but you're a human being and you can only take so much. I actually don't think it would be unreasonable of you to end this relationship if this is what you're going to have to deal with for the rest of your life. You deserve a decent life as well. Good luck with everything OP xxx", "NTA\nAsk her what about *your* mental AND physical health?\nAlso, are you sure the therapist is actually validating everything like this? Sounds a lot like your wife is just saying \"but my therapist says...\" to sort of add weight to what she says. And to accuse you of manipulation is ridiculous.", "NTA. Mental health is important, but damn she hasn't done ANYTHING?? A cooked meal is the *least* I could do if I weren't working and my spouse was. There's no way she's that crippled to the point where she can look at someone working 84 hours a week and imply they're the selfish one. Like this account, make her a throwaway too.", "NTA\n\nIf I'd spent the last five years pulling in 84 hour weeks, I think I would've snapped a long time ago. So I really cannot blame you for losing it with your wife.\n\n>I am running myself ragged, and what happens if I have a mental break? Do you think I will have the luxury of not working? No, I will have to push through my demons.\n\nThere will come a point eventually where you simply won't have a choice to 'push through' a mental break; you will *physically* become unable to carry on. \n\nI think you're at a turning point in your marriage. Your wife has watched you work insane hours for five years and shows no signs of even thinking about returning to work and taking the pressure off you. She is expecting you to continue like this for an indefinite amount of time and that is **not** okay. Either she has a *really* shitty therapist who isn't helping her at all, or she is being dishonest with you about about the therapist is saying in order to get out of returning to work. \n\nWhatever's going on, OP you **need** to prioritise your own health **now** before it's too late.", "NTA. It may be time to call this an unsustainable relationship and let it go.", "NTA\n\nDont burn yourself to warm others, at least not for 5 freaking years.", " NTA. You need to consider if this relationship is still for you.", "NTA. Sitting at home doing nothing is never going to make her recover. All the mental health professionals I have had have always stressed the importance of spending your time productively and that includes employment. Your wife is taking advantage of you and she doesn't seem to care what this is costing you.", "NTA. You are basically working yourself to the bone, yet your wife is still not improving in any skills (or so you claimed) for her mental health break. As much as mental health is important, she should see it from your perspective too. It is so bold of her to say that you are seeking for your comfort rather than hers, when you have not been comfortable for the entire time you had extra work.", "NTA. A year, maybe two are okay, but after 5 years he should have been healed enough to working anything to support her husband. She is really hiding behind something. You need to call it quits, she is using you. She doesn't have to go back to work, so she isn't. Don't end yourself just to please her. 84 hours a week will burn you out soon, I am surprised it hasn't yet. I work half of that and sometimes it's too much. You probably don't have kids or something like that, right? You need to take care of yourself now, if that means divorcing her, you have to do it. She has a therapist, she can rely on, so she should be fine mentally. Leave, before it burns you out.", "Her therapist is the biggest asshole here. NTA even with the blow up because it sounds like you have discussed many, many viable options and they were all shot down. In the end there is nothing you can do to fix this situation, she has to be the one putting in the work. Unfortunately she has demonstrated, repeatedly, that she is not willing or able to do that. I cannot even imagine the sheer overwhelming amount of resentment you must be feeling. \n\nIf she's willing to try something different maybe she could see a different therapist and try a different kind of therapy. CBT has really helped me personally with work related PTSD but idk what is most appropriate for your wife. For reference, I was able to go back to work after 3 months. 5 years is crazy, maybe literally. \n\nThe real question here is, what are you going to do if she refuses to change?", "INFO: you mention marriage counseling, is this still going on? Also, have you gone to any therapy appointments with her and/or suggested joining one? \n\nIt\u2019s certainly fair that after almost 5 years you feel a burnout of sorts, married or not, the hours and time you\u2019re putting in are not sustainable for anyone. Attending a session would probably be the better step than resorting to an outburst and saying unkind things. It\u2019s also possible this isn\u2019t the right therapist if you don\u2019t see any real forward momentum but she can\u2019t/doesn\u2019t see that.", "NTA. \n\nYour Wife isn\u2019t going back to work. \n\nIf she has had five years of therapy and she isn\u2019t back in work, then she has absolutely no intentions of ever doing it. Five years is a ridiculous amount of time to be off work for a \u2018mental breakdown\u2019. Is her therapist real? \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s spent the past few years gaslighting you and emotionally manipulating you, whilst she simultaneously works you to death. You\u2019re killing yourself with 18 hour days for her and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the villain in every story she tells. Has she ever thanked you for supporting her? Does she do anything nice for you? I\u2019d bet not. \n\nIn fact, I\u2019d bet that after your argument the other day, her \u2018therapist\u2019 has told her that she\u2019s had her progress set back so much and it\u2019s all your fault\u2026 Blah blah blah. \n\nThis woman has trapped you in a financially abusive relationship and is quite content with working you to death. She enjoys being unemployed and not lifting a finger to help, while you slave 18 hour days and then have to get home and cook. She forced you into marriage counselling to victimise herself and blame you for pushing her into work and ruining the relationship. \n\nShe calls you a manipulator, plays the victim, says that you only care about yourself when you\u2019ve worked 84 hour weeks for the past 5 years\u2026 Dude this woman is toxic, abusive, and you need to get away from her. She is happy with you working yourself into an early grave, she cares about your money, not your well-being. She expects you to cater to her every whim and provide for her, and the second you say you can\u2019t take it any more, you\u2019re a piece of shit\u2026 \n\nIn my country a 37 hour working week is fairly average. You\u2019re working over double that. She doesn\u2019t appreciate it, and in fact, blames you and insults you because you can\u2019t do it anymore. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how angry I am for you. If you don\u2019t slow down you\u2019re going to work yourself into an early grave, for a woman who, from what you\u2019ve told us, clearly doesn\u2019t care about you.\n\nI beg of you, please get a good Solicitor/Lawyer and DIVORCE THIS WOMAN. You are in an abusive relationship. She will attempt to manipulate and emotionally blackmail you forever if you don\u2019t stop it now. \n\nI can\u2019t say it enough, you are being abused massively, and she has no intention of getting better as long as she can subjugate you into being her cash cow. You know she isn\u2019t trying to improve herself, she doesn\u2019t try and make your life even a little bit easier by learning to cook\u2026 You\u2019re slaving yourself for her and she does not appreciate you. \n\nPlease please please divorce her. You deserve so much better.", "NTA.

She seems like a lost cause, the we she has is not with you. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nAlso there are a few questions for your wife's therapist. Did her therapist actually tell her you would try to manipulate her to go back to work?

She would still be able to stay home and it would bring in some money at least.\n\nIt's not fair on you. This isn't about you being comfortable, this is about you being overworked to death.\n\nI have a physical disability and it's very severe, from an illness, so of course depression and mental health problems come with it. I have insane problem with mobility and can't really work like a normal person. I've been looking for work online for a while now.\n\nAnd consider me - barely able to move, always in physical pain, always. I left the house yesterday for two hours. I have hair that reaches to middle of my back. When I came home, the effort of just walking around some fucking shops is such a workout for me, my hair, entire head, not just crown, but every strand, was dripping with sweat.

And those are very, very good reasons to be angry with her.\n\nMental health problems, even disability, don't give you a blank slate to do nothing. She can do stuff. If she hates cooking, she should meal prep, so she can actually buy those bags for oven, get chicken, spices and make it in the oven, there you go, homemade dinner. For the first 20 minutes of chicken put in the oven the tray with salted peppered vegetables like broccoli and there you go, second element of dinner.

She has been going to therapy since, and we started marriage counseling during Covid. Reason for marriage counseling was because she thought I was pushing her too hard to go back to work before her and her therapist thought she was ready. I tried to explain many times that was not my intent but realisticly speaking for me to keep up with expenses, and retirement contributions I pretty much have to take on extra shifts which sometimes clock in over 18 hours a day, and on average I have been pulling 84 hour weeks. I have been doing this since she stopped working. \n\nWe recently had a fight cause I had an extremely rough week and had the conversation again about her going back to work. She opened up with the same line she always does \"We do not feel it is the right time yet, she feels I have made great progress and if I rush it I run the risk of losing it.\" The we being her and therapist. I told her I really do not give a fuck what her therapist has to say, and I am sick of you hiding behind her words whenever this topic comes up. \n\nShe started to cry, telling me she does not like being this way either and I am belittling her due to suffering from mental health issues. I replied saying I do not indeed to belittle you or not take your issues seriously problem is I am running myself ragged, and what happens if I have a mental break? Do you think I will have the luxury of not working? No, I will have to push through my demons. \n\nShe said her therapist warned her this would happen sooner or later I would try to manipulate her into doing something she was not ready to do. This is when I really lost it and just let it all out. I did not say anything kind. I told her she insults me for thinking what I am doing is manipulation. I told her I am working these extra shifts so she can be home and bullshit playing games. I told during this entire time you have not even made an effort to improve on certain skills, I told her she can still not cook to save her life, and that was sick of coming home after 12 or 18 hour days just make us dinner cause her idea of making dinner is pretty a pre-made in the oven or ordering out. Among other things, that said she stormed out the house crying yelling and shouting how I am a piece of shit, and rather see myself comfortable verse her getting better. \n\nSo here I am, I do not feel at the core I am wrong, and while what I said was harsh I think it did have to be said. So reddit was I the asahole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.  She doesn't have to go back to teaching, shecan go back to a stressfree position.  I had a really difficult time in 2015, which ended in a friend no longer being here due to DV, her ex is in prison for life, I lost the ability to cope with anything except things like caring for myself, anything that caused a little stress and I lost it.  I took 6mths off work and then went back into an easy stressfree job to slowly adjust.  You are killing yourself, and she doesn't seem grateful at all.  If she hasn't improved enough in 5 years then she needs to get a new therapist because this one isn't helping.  Or it could be she has no intention of ever going back in which case you have some serious decisions to make, you shouldn't have to work the hours you are, you cannot maintain it longterm for your own health. If my husband was working those hours continually I would be doing anything I could to help.", "Nta\n\nWhat about your mental health.\n\nAfter 5 years of 80+ hour weeks I think its time for you to go to your own therapist. You must be quiet burnt out.\n\nYou can't force her to work buy you can leave the relationship.", "NTA. Perhaps you could suggest a different job, starting off part-time? Honestly, teaching is tough even without mental health issues, but there must be shops or restaurants in your area looking for staff? This would be a lower pressure field of work, it might help her rebuild her confidence and contribute to expenses.", "NTA she is using her mental health as an excuse to be lazy. She \"had a breakdown\" - what diagnosis was she given that could justify 5 years off of work?", "NTA, I experienced burnout last year and had 4 months off- it is an awful experience. I went back to work on a phased return which seemed to work for me in that it helped with the feeling of being overwhelmed by going back. Perhaps this could be a compromise for her to test the waters- go back part time with whatever she is comfortable starting with, and build up slowly from there- this way she has time to adjust and assess how she feels / if she can cope. Not working from 2018 is a very long time, I could understand how many it feels daunting and overwhelming to go back to work. That being said, the longer she stays away completely the harder it will be. Additionally- therapist sounds like a red flag, someone pulling 18hrs a day for so many years is likely also burned out and not trying to manipulate anyone here. Therapist shouldn\u2019t be dismissing other people\u2019s boundaries.", "NTA. it's been 5 years, if she cared at all she could have looked at working 1-2 days a week in a job and gradually built up at her own speed. But she didn't. She's happy living off your hard work and gaslighting you and her therapist is enabling her. \n\nAs a kid we had a family friend with the same dynamic. He was the breadwinner and she supplemented their income with dolls she would make (she was very creative) he had a work related breakdown and didn't go back to work. This was like 10+ years before we knew them. She would work her ass off making these dolls to support their family to the point she started getting arthritis in her hands in her early 40's. \n\nHe didn't care, he was happy spending his days smoking and drinking and watching porn (us kids accidentally found his porn folder on the family pc.... a  very awkward day...).", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with mental health issues all my life. I spent 10 years being a suicidal, depressed ball of anxiety. It\u2019s not fun. I understand where your wife is coming from.\n\nI am also about to finish my Bach. Of Ed degree. This is my second career as my old one made me terribly unhappy. I have worked in the education field for almost two years and yes, it is mentally exhausting and the kids can be crazy, never mind the parents and admin (I\u2019ve been lucky to have excellent admin).\n\nBut I have never taken a 6 year sabbatical. A 2 month one during the summer, yes and it was my first vacation in nearly 15 years and my second in my entire life - the first being 2 weeks to visit family.\n\nIf your wife is unhappy teaching, then switch professions. But it\u2019s unfair and unrealistic to expect you to carry her for years and years. You can\u2019t keep pace working like that without burn out, something she should be familiar with and able to relate too as I suspect she crashed from a combination of compassionate fatigue and burnout. Christ, even working part time would be a benefit. But it\u2019s not fair to you to have to work 12-18+ hour days and come home without a warm meal to greet you. \n\nPersonally, it\u2019s my philosophy that if I can\u2019t contribute financially, I will be damn sure to contribute in some other way.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you and your wife are going through this.", "NTA.  She\u2019s an albatross at this point.  Your shouting at her is probably the healthiest thing you\u2019ve done for yourself in years.  I\u2019d separate.

I would physically colaps a long time ago.", "NTA.\n\nBelieve me, my mental health and life would be much better if I didn't have to work too, but the house and bills have to be paid.\n\nIf she needed a 6 month break that would be one thing, but it sounds like it has been 5 years? Nah. I couldn't live like that unless my salary was crazy high to truly comfortably support all of us without working overtime.\n\nI'd honestly leave any partner that didn't contribute, but that's just me - you do what you feel is right OP, but you're not an ass.", "NTA your at ur breaking point", "NTA and you would not be out of line to give her the ultimatum that if she does not start pulling her weight, you will end the relationship. She is using you bro.", "NTA, it sounds to me as though the therapist is just feeding your wife the information she wants to hear. And in that way she can retain a client! But this situation is certainly is not sustainable long-term and you certainly need to do what you need to do to protect yourself.", "If you don't have kids then I would probably walk away.  5 years of 84 hours a week is way too much and she doesn't seem to care.", "Mental health struggles are real, but I see so many people weaponizing it to avoid responsibility and accountability.

What happens if you're injured, or break down or even have a heart attack? She's weaponizing her issues and her therapist against you.

If her choice is work or starve, I bet that her mental illness will clear up pretty quickly.", "NTA - Its been 5 years. You deserve a break as well.", "NTA, but it sounds like you're coming from a place of basically being worn down. I don't think it would be selfish to tell her that you can't keep doing these overlong days and that money is going to run dry at some point when you stop, and that solving that can't be just your problem anymore. You very well could end up having a breakdown of your own.  \n\n\nBreakdowns are serious shit. I still don't feel like I'm back at full capacity a year and a half after having a near-burnout/major depressive episode. But I have gone back to working and studying. Five years of not doing essentially anything to contribute to a shared household definitely seems like enough is gonna have to be enough.", "NTA.  This reminds me of a song by The Offspring.  Feels like you are being taken advantage of here.", "Teacher here. I went into my eigth year teaching last year at a city school, tier 1 level. It was suppose to be the best school in the district however there was not only verbal abuse but also fighting, throwing things, filming teachers all on a daily basis. These were not special education kids with IEP plans, this was just Gen Ed! \n\n\nI worked for nine months and by the time I got to my ninth month, I was having panic attacks before bed and on the drive to work. I started dissassociating at work during these events. I would have to leave the room because a panic attacks would take over when they fought or started to verbally assault me. \n\n\nAll of this, I had never had before. My mental health had never tanked before. I felt so scared and alone. I now have anxiety on a daily basis and I will feel out of control. I quit mid year at nine months in because I couldn't handle it. I started on meds and therapy weekly since. \n\n\n\nComing from another teacher who has had this very thing happen, believe her. She is most likely terrified of going back to a school to teach and does not know what other skills she has to contribute in another field. Many teachers feel stuck when they want to leave because they don't know how to translate their very long skill list into industry vocabulary. \n\n\nWhat you're doing will not sustain. So I would have a conversation with her and say to her, \"I know you must be terrified to go back into a school. After what happened, I don't really want you in one.  I am all for a career switch for you. Why don't we discuss what other careers you are also interested in and let's get someone to help us rewrite your resume for that career?\" \n\n\nYou know your work schedule is not sustainable so you have to have a Convo that is calm and reassures her that she's not stuck. You support her moving careers if she needs to.", "Nta. You know it\u2019s probably cheaper to divorce her lazy ass. She can move in with her therapist", "You are NTA. In my old job I burnt out. Like crying every day, gained 20 pounds, insomnia the whole nine yards. I quit. But only after I found a new job, less stress and hours (and actually more money). After I started the new job I found a therapist, took a vacation, and started eating better (since I wasn\u2019t eating in hotels anymore). Burn out is not an excuse to not work for 5 years! My husband just went through it. He took 4 months off and switched to four days a week. There are ways to deal with it without putting all the pressure on your partner", "NTA. I have been suffering with severe depression and suicidal ideation for over three years now and I have no choice but to keep going because ain\u2019t no one going to slave away for me forever until I feel healthy enough to not be a complete leech on my family and society at large. Wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if all these \u201csick\u201d people buddied up with each other and fucked right off? Leave this anchor before she sinks you for good.", "OP,  we all have One life to live. Doing this to yourself isn't worth it. Your wife isn't taking any responsibility. She needs to be a partner, not a child. And she's made it clear that she won't do that.\n\nGet out of this one-sided relationship for your own sanity.\nBest of luck.", "Nta. This is insane entitlement on her part and manipulative. Tears because doesn\u2019t and to work? Come off it.", "NTA, this thing won\u2019t work if the genders were reversed. Feel like you have a big decision coming down the road.", "NTA. I'm diagnosed with more than three \"mental illnesses\" ( for example depression, severe social anxiety, ADHD). \nTaking a break is necessary sometimes. But 5 years aren't a break. I believe that many will never feel ready or the right time to start work again after a long time. But 5 years seems way too much. Even people who were months in mental psychwards start working earlier again than she is. I offcause don't know her story. But to me, it seems like she uses her mental illness as an excuse because working is exhausting. I think if she's so severely mentally  ill that after 5 years of  she can't even work part time, she needs way more than \"normal\" therapy.  This is very intense. \n\nI understand that she probably can't work full-time. Or she needs to start part-time but at another job. But she can't just let you do anything for almost 5 years. I think you waited long enough. From what she said, she seems very manipulative.", "You are frustrated and let it all out. You have every right too. At this point you need to figure out what you next step is. I personally would not stay with somebody that has no desire to work. If she can't teach, then maybe she needs to find another career that suits her better. You alone cannot keep pulling all of the weight. \n\nNTA.", "Find a lawyer first. She\u2019s got all day to call every lawyer in town to make an appointment so you can\u2019t use them. See an attorney first. Say nothing until the day before she will be served.", "OP isn't the one manipulating. NTA", "I don\u2019t think you understand burn out. Executive functions are all out of wack. Rest \u2260 not doing anything when your mental health is all out of wack. Nah. OP you may suggest she live with her parents and you separate\u2026. So you both can focus on your own mental health\u2026 or separate completely.", "84 hours a week is INSANE. I feel bad for this guy.  \nThis setup is not working. I can't say whose fault it is, but OP is NTA.", "Regarding the therapist. It will all boil down to what she is telling the therapist. \n\nIs she telling truthfully that OP works up to 84 hours a week, pays all the bills, and every single expense in the house, plus comes home to cook dinner, etc. \n\nOr is she feeding the therapist? \"I tried to cook dinner today, but he was complaining!\" But forgets to mention it was one of those tiny portions of frozen food that will give no nutrition to a grown man who works his ass off. \nBecause if she said, \"I cooked dinner!\" Then, of course, the therapist will see that as \"progress, \" but her big bad husband was hindering her. \n\nSo, all in all. It depends on what the woman is saying in therapy. \nShe could honestly just be painting the \"poor me\" picture and nit picks what the therapist said to get her way", "I 100% agree. If there is no improvement in 5 years then she needs a new therapist or she is not taking therapy seriously.\nNTA. But you need some change. Couples counseling or separation (even if temporary). \nCan she apply for any state disability to help out financially?", "Or she's twisting what the therapist is telling her to suit her refusal to move forward. And also misrepresenting the situation. \n\nAt this point, 5 years into a sick leave from work, she should have a psychiatrist, a clear diagnosis, medication, as well as either a plan to retrain for a different job or an official permanent disability diagnosis. And her therapist would need to be a proper psychologist who specializes in whatever diagnosis she has and is working alongside the psychiatrist.\n\nOP needs a lawyer to get a divorce ready and attempt to avoid alimony. That probably starts with going back to a normal work week and downgrading their living situation accordingly.", "Volunteer work really helped me during my burnout. Even just 4 hours a week got me out of the house and used to working with others once more. I also loved art therapy when I was at my lowest.\n\n\nBest of luck in your recovery.", "I always thought that part of the recovery is to ease back into things. Short shifts, personal goal etc", "I went through this last year, had a full 4ish months off and then phased myself back. Therapy helped and I also did hypnotherapy and looked after myself and disconnected. Whilst the first 2 months were horrible, it did get better. Everyone has their own timeline of course, it just seems like a lot in 5 years.", "Agreed. None of my past therapist would say these things to me, nor allowed me to go on like that for over 5 years. They are far to busy and have too many patients and a full wait list. In my experience, if they don\u2019t see actual progress after a year, they recommend changing therapists and will pass your case to a colleague.", "I used to work in unemployment and you\u2019re completely right here. We strongly advice that people attend courses, do volunteer work, learn a new skill etc, especially if they\u2019re not physically/mentally ready for work. \n\nSomething dodgy is going on here. I\u2019m wondering if the therapist is a \u2018friend\u2019 of OP\u2019s partner.", "Exactly, my ex had a burn-out when we were together. At first it was really really difficult on the both of us, seeing as she was in that mental state and I am .... wired a little differently. I tend to be a bit full-on sometimes. \n\nEventually I did learn to let her be, recovery takes time. The only thing I did expect was that she keep up her share of the housework. I wouldn't tell her the how/what/where to do, but I made it clear I expected that contribution. Nothing else, just our weekly clean, the dishes and the washing (we each had our own bit to do, so she didn't have to do more than usual). That at least got her back into the habit of doing things again, which did help. But it's a rough journey, best wishes to you!", "It took me about 3 months to recover from burnout. I rested, I picked up some new hobbies, I found a different job, I did some therapy. After 5 *years* OP\u2019s wife should have *something* to show for all of that down time.", "Yep I definitely think the therapist is one of the core issues here.. 5 year consistent pay check... Not sure it's in her best interest to have the wife fit to work again.", "Yup I agree. The only way he'll know what's going on with that therapist is to go and meet with them. 5 years is way too long. My husband had work issues, he was back working in a different job about 3 months in with the help of his therapist.", ".. and she\u2019s going to benefit from his death!! I shudder at the thought!!! \ud83d\ude16", "You\u2019d think if the therapist was so against her going back to work, she\u2019d happily sign paperwork for disability right? This therapist sounds like she\u2019s not great. She\u2019s enabling if this is all true. The therapist should be guiding the wife to make healthy choices and throwing manipulative tantrums when a strong subject comes up is not the choice. Maybe report the therapist for misconduct???\n\nEdit : NTA", "Understanding maybe but she could easily work any customer service job from home that has nothing to do with school if that\u2019s the trigger. This just seems like she just doesn\u2019t want to work.", "I have brought up remote work, volunteering, tutoring one-on-one. This is not the first time I brought this conversation up. I always get shot down, during this entire time this was the only time I have ever snapped. I get what you are saying though.", "Cautiously, alimony sucks and a lot of states can be brutal about it.", "There was a r/legadvice (Could be a different subreddit, not sure) post a while back where someone did that. Let's just say the judge did not look favourably on the guy that did that...... Trying to sabotage someone's legal representation does not help when deciding on alimony.", "This is the way. Say nothing, get a lawyer, serve her divorce papers.", "I never said he was. How on earth did you read that into my comment?\n\nI am simply pointing out that if she refuses to work, he has only two options: live with it, or divorce her.", "It is all out of whack and unpleasant but 5 years is a long time, esp as she\u2019s not even trying a couple of hrs and building up. From someone who was on medical last year for burnout.", "I am sorry but no. People get burn out, people have mental issues and they still have to be responsible like everyone else. Why is she so special that she gets to live her best life because of the burn out at the expense of op, and his mental and physical health? No. If she doesn\u2019t understand that, she can be a dead weight for her parents then because she is just selfish.\n\nEdit: by someone that had a severe burn out, and had to bounce back and still work, and do life because I am an adult and not a burden on people.", "*I don\u2019t think you understand burn out.*\n\nIs that remark directed at me, or OP? (Because it was my comment you responded to.)\n\nI understand burnout very well. I left a job after two decades because I was burnt out, and took a good long break.\n\nBut OP's wife left her job **five years ago.** That's long enough to recover from the worst burnout. OP is now the one who is well on the way to burning out.\n\nIf OP's wife still needs more recovery time after five years of this, then OP is justified in asking himself: am I prepared to continue doing the work of two people in this relationship? If his answer is no, then he knows what he needs to do.", "That\u2019s just pushing the responsibility on someone else. In 5 years she should have figured out some way to cope and improve her situation, whether that\u2019s finding a job that she enjoys or working part time. Leaving everything to OP and not even making sure he has dinner ready for him when he\u2019s working insanely long hours (which can negatively affect his health) is inexcusable and shows how little she cares about him.", "Yeah. Not since 2018 behave. This coming from a stressed and burnt out teacher. \ud83d\ude02", "I now a lot of people who had a burn-out. Not one of them was out for 5 years. And yes they hit rock bottom and their executive functions where \u2018out of wack\u2019.", "No. Absolutely not\n\nI took have ADHD and severe executive function disorder. I don't get to use that as an excuse *for five years* while my partner busts his ass all day every day.\n\nThe wife is 1000% the AH here. She is refusing to actually deal with her issues or make ANY effort to contribute to the household.\n\nSeriously, people need to stop using their mental health as an excuse to just NEVER improve. That's not how it works. No one feels bad for the person who weighs 600 pounds, eats nothing but junk food all day every day, and then cries that they're unhappy. At some point, you have to take some accountability", "Exactly. The therapist can only work with the Information she gives. So either the therapist really goes baby steps in this case or gets the wrong information", "Thanks for responding. It's nice to hear other people's stories. Especially the success stories. I'm feeling much better now thank you xxx", "Yeah, that's exactly right. In my case, I ended up burnt out because I had no concept of slowing down and I've had to learn to manage my energy levels (including not doing too much even when I feel like it). I'm trying to keep myself in a routine like getting up when my husband does, doing a bit of housework, doing a bit in the garden, exercising etc. \n\nIt sounds as though OP's wife has basically just done nothing for the past 5 years and I'm struggling to believe that any therapist would actually encourage that. You do have days where you feel like doing nothing and it's OK to lie on the couch for a day occasionally but you have to push yourself a little bit, you can't just do nothing and expect your partner to take care of you for the rest of your life.", "Either the therapist is not giving her homework or she is not doing it", "Exactly. I've been off work since February and I'm feeling pretty much better now. The only reason I've not started easing back in just yet is because I have a 3 week holiday booked in September so there's not much point just yet. \n\nYou're right, everyone does have their own timeline but I would imagine that if after a year or so you're not well enough to at least start easing back in, your psych would be coming up with other things to try with you. I can't imagine any psychologist just advising someone to sit on the couch for 5 years and do nothing.", "Yeah, that's what I was thinking. This is my first experience of therapy so I'm no expert but I'm really struggling to believe that any therapist would advise that you sit on the couch for 5 years and do nothing.", "Yeah, the things that she's saying to her husband are pretty much the complete opposite of what's been said to me and I'm struggling to believe that her therapist is actually telling her these things. I'm going to follow this post to see if OP posts an update in the future because I just get a little feeling there's a bit more to this than meets the eye. I wouldn't be surprised at all if we get an update in a few weeks and it transpires that she's not been entirely honest.", "Your wife is a useless partner.  I know divorce is always thrown at people but you should seriously consider it.  Why burn yourself out for someone that clearly doesn't care about you?", "I'd probably edit to add that as that bit of context does change things a bit. Not the not arguing to hurt feelings part, but it definitely makes the escalation clearer. Sorry this is going on. As someone who's been divorced once, there's a sense of disconnect and cold when you know you're done, and it becomes easier to hurt each other. If you're looking at staying together, maybe talk with a different therapist. Not saying she has to stop seeing the one she sees as this may come off as isolation. Just someone who can be a neutral third-party. Luck.", "ESH, but mostly you. You are absolutely working very hard and it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re exhausted, but that fact has nothing to do with whether she\u2019s well enough to work. It was in fact manipulative to suggest you would work through a mental break when you have no idea if you\u2019d be able to and it was in fact belittling to dismiss her medical provider\u2019s advice. If you think she\u2019s lying to you or the therapist, then address that; don\u2019t just say she has to ignore medical advice.\n\nBut if she cannot work, she should at least apply for disability to relieve some financial pressure on you. And she\u2019s not obligated to be a better cook- it just may not be a skill she has- but expenses like takeout aren\u2019t fair when the budget needs to be tightened.", "My apologies. I was adding to your post. I didn't want to repeat it..", "Im surprised the therapist hasn\u2019t encouraged OP wife to volunteer or find a casual or part time job at least five years out of the workforce=less hireable.\n\nFive years on I\u2019m suspicious wife is being truthful about what the therapist says and/or what she tells the therapist.", "NTA.  Absolutely... something. Part time teachers assistant. One on one in a tutoring center. Child care center. Safety departments at factories hire teachers to do stay safe stuff. Hospitals hire teachers to give presentations on many subjects. Lots of sidelines if she doesnt want to go back to a classroom.", "And again, even if it's baby steps. It depends on what they are told. \nIf the wife says, \"I can't even get out of bed,\" then getting out of bed and eating something. A shower. Is baby steps.\nBut if the wife says I can fine get out of bed and do chores, etc, but I'm scared of getting a job among people. Then going places with a tiny crowd for 10 min could be baby steps.\nA therapist can only work with you if you are truthful of your limitations. So, any exaggeration, etc. Won't bring any progress.\n\nSo I fully agree.", "I\u2019m so happy to hear! Enjoy your holiday!!! Also you are very right, my therapist advised doing things I enjoy even if it was hiking, reading - start by going out for walks, low intensity stuff at first. def was not encouraged to just stay in and not do anything to help myself along."]}
