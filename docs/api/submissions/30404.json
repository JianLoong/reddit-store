Things like that.\n\nYesterday I went by the local market and found rabbit meat, which is not always available and I always buy it when I get the chance. I wasn\u2019t trying to trick them into eating rabbit, I honestly just forgot to tell them what it was in the moment I served. \n\nMy nephew liked it and asked me what it was - when I told them, the nephew didn\u2019t mind much, but my niece looked shocked and eventually cried. I knew they never owned a rabbit (I\u2019d be more sensible about serving rabbit if they ever had one as a pet), but apparently one my niece\u2019s best friends owns one and she plays with it every time she goes to this friend\u2019s house.\n\nI called my sister to tell her what happened, because I didn\u2019t want her to find out in any other way (as in my niece saying: \u201cuncle X made us eat rabbits!\u201d). My sister thought I should have predicted it would be shocking for kids to be served rabbits, and suggested I stopped \u201cexploring\u201d with her kids and just stick to the usual French fries and fish sticks.

Nor should you concern yourself with every opinion. \n\nThat brings it only to the delivery. Primary caretakers live everyday with the struggles of picky eating children.
