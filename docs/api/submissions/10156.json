They're not not anywhere near that point yet and it's just been sitting empty so I decided to rent it for the time being. It has 2 small bedrooms, a half bath, a kitchenette and a small sitting area. It's not well equipped enough to be fully self contained so the common spaces are still shared.\n\nI rented the space to \"Joe\" (37M) last year. Joe has an 10 year daughter \"Mia\"; the 2nd bedroom down there was hers during Joe's custody time.\n\nMia is a brat. I try not to hold it against her because she's 10 and it just is what it is, I was an ass then too but I generally like children and I go out of my way to avoid her. About 2 months ago, Mia started having major conflicts with her mom and Joe moved her in with us full time until it gets resolved.\n\nThis is not working for me. She's creating problems constantly and they're impacting my life \n\nsome examples:\n\n1. She was complaining of severe stomach pain one night and Joe took her to the ER. It was put together that she had gone into my bathroom cabinet and ate close to an entire container of my fiber gummies. Joe claims this was my fault\n2. She keeps trying to dress up my cats. She, of course, got the shit clawed out of herself and this was again my fault.\n3. She tried to take the cats on a walk and they ran from her. It took me 6 hours to find them both.\n4. She steals and uses my expensive bubble bath/bath bombs and then lies to me like I can't see the pink glitter ring in the tub.\n\nThis exploded over this week. My boyfriend's house caught fire on Friday. It's not destroyed but it'll be 4-8 weeks before they'll be able to go back so him and his 5 year old \"Gabe\" are staying with me. Mia is furious, she doesn't like that Gabe uses the living room TV when it used to be open for her. She hates that he tries to play with her. She yells at him and once pushed him and he fell down. \n\nThis is unacceptable. He has just as much right to be here as she does and Joe consistently downplays her behavior. I've had enough so today, I gave Joe notice to vacate. \n\nHe's distraught, Mia can go back to her mom's but Joe claims he can't afford a 2 bed anywhere else and he'll lose his custody time if i make him leave. He is extremely upset and told me I was an awful person to evict a child for acting like a child.

He\u2019s enabling terrible behavior by claiming she\u2019s just \u201cacting like a child.\u201d If I were you, once my pets were put in danger, I\u2019d issue the notice and never look back (not to mention the behavior toward your bf\u2019s son!). Hopefully Joe can channel his stress and desperation into working on his parenting.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like joe isn\u2019t even trying to parent his child", "NTA. One thing is her being a brat, another is the father blaming you, who shouldn\u2019t have to deal with his daughter, for stuff she does that should be his responsibility to prevent. I honestly would have drawn the line when she started bothering my pets and LOST them. Your house is not equipped for that child, so I don\u2019t blame you for your decision.", "NTA. \n\nCommon spaces are shared. Your bathroom is not a common area, she should not be in it. She\u2019s 10, she can understand this. \n\nShe causes stress to you animals and let them loose. They could have been hurt as you looked for them. Again, she\u2019s 10. She can easily understand that the cats stay inside and aren\u2019t to be dressed up. \n\nYour boyfriend and his kid take priority in your life before the tenant. Mia may live there, but it\u2019s not her house. It also doesn\u2019t sound like her dad is doing much parenting if her behavior hasn\u2019t changed in roughly a year.

Otherwise, it\u2019s time to find a new place.", "NTA\n\nYeah she's acting like a child, but her dad needs to act like an adult.\n\nEither he get out and reduce his visitation legally, or he will lose her legally, if she continues: \n\nStealing from OP's closet and eating whatever she finds, ending up in the hospital.\n\nHarassing the cats and getting noticeably injured.\n\nAttacking someone else's children.\n\nThese are all incidents that CPS would investigate, and likely removing the child and returning her to the custodial parent, if found to be the father's fault. He needs to get his shit together and work on getting himself a place, and telling the mom to get her kid in therapy.\n\nWhat is HE doing while her kid is off in OP's part of the house stealing, messing with animals and fighting with everyone else?

A ten-year-old should definitely know better. Holy hell.\n\nI can understand Joe being distraught about the situation, but honestly, that really isn't your problem. You have to look out for yourself and those closest to you. And it definitely doesn't seem like he's actually parenting his daughter. Get them out of there before she causes you serious problems.", "NTA. He's not being a responsible parent or roommate. That's his choice, but his choices have consequences.

Unsure as to why he is blaming you for his child\u2019s actions when he, is in fact, the parent\u2026 is he not watching her and teaching her that actions have consequences?", "NTA - she is 10 that is old enough to understand no, I\u2019m sure you told her not to try and dress your cats, not to let them out, etc. If her father refused to address the behavior and blames it on you, there is nothing you can do but evict them. You rented the place to him, you were not expecting to have her full time.

That sounds untenable and it will not improve because her dad isn\u2019t trying at all. You deserve to be comfortable in your own house.", "NTA. He hasn't even tried to discipline Mia.

You have every right to kick them out.", "NTA.\n\nChildren are idiots, and sounds like Mia is particularly bratty -- perhaps in part owing to a lot of difficult feelings about her parents' split up. But Joe has consistently refused to discipline his child over what I think are unreasonable things to tolerate. Mia is stealing from you and harming your pets, and has even assaulted your boyfriend's child. \n\nUnfortunately Joe did not try to find an amicable solution and it is HIS behavior and poor parenting (not Mia's behavior) that has caused him to lose his housing.", "NTA. The problem is, he's trying to make up for her mother being a bad mother. And thats not the right thing. Have you considered forcing him to put her in therapy? I mean... Yeah she's a kid. But at the same time, there are certain things that she should know not to do. Such as lying. She's scared of getting in trouble, but thats a consequence to her actions. Unfortunately, he's learning a hard lesson that he needs to be her parent, not her friend.", "Could you demand him to send his daughter back to her mom while you give him enough time to find another house to relocate instead of short notice eviction.

I feel bad for Joe, but he did this to himself. You haven't done anything wrong and his future housing is his own problem to deal with.", "NTA. You are not evicting Joe because his daughter acts like a child.

Another resulted in her being scratched by cats (and how many times has that happened?). It's not clear if Gabe got hurt when pushed down, but he could have been. This is not about incidents where \"someone could have gotten hurt\". Its about incidents where someone did get hurt. Mostly his own child.\n\nYou might want to ask him what level of bodily harm it will take occurring to someone in one of these incidents for him to accept that his daughter is out of control?\n\nBut no matter his answer, he needs to find somewhere else to live while dealing with it.", "NAH.

I'm assuming they have a 30 day notice - if they show you they can get along for the first 21 days, you can let them stay. If not, they're out on the same schedule.

Harming an animal so that the cat deeply scratches the child requires intervention. That Joe deflected this responsibility of his parenting onto OP and blamed OP is madness to me.\n\nShe's not an axe murderer... but saying this is \"not that abnormal\" for a 10 year old is just not the right answer. 10 year olds can understand right from wrong. Then can understand they need to control their impulses around fragile things, like animals and smaller children. Mia seems to be missing these cues and Joe is downplaying these issues.

And how is she supposed to feel about all this? She wanted to watch TV, play with the cats, eat some cool looking sweets she found and have a magical sparkly bath. She's ten. She doesn't understand how those things can impact you. And now she has to deal with the fact that someone thinks she's responsible for her dad losing their home? And has to go back and live with a parent she has a worse relationship as punishment? What do you think that's going to do to her development, how do you think that's going to help any issues she might have?", "Not only that but the whole thing with the gummies and getting clawed by the cat. There\u2019s a lawsuit just waiting to happen the longer that kid stays cause God knows dad is not taking responsibility", "Of course what Mia did was wrong, but OP said the suite has a half bath, so presumably Joe and Mia have access to a bathroom in the main house to shower.", "at least it wasn't a bottle of edibles", "She already has. Op states she yells at him, tries to force him out of shared spaces and has already pushed him down once.", "How is Joe not an asshole for routinely blaming *OP* for what goes wrong with *his* child instead of accepting accountability and recognising that Mia is at fault, even though Mia has influential circumstances?\n\nI agree its all unfortunate, but Joe isn't taking accountability for what's happening and is expecting OP to not only take the blame, but take what happens without being able t react accordingly.", "[rest assured](https://www.lushusa.com/stories/article_all-that-glitters.html)", "Joe is already stepping all over OP as it is. He's not a good housemate.", "Joe has a shared custody agreement and presumably wouldn't be willing to not have Mia overnight at the house. Its not feasible for Joe to keep living there if Mia can't be in the house at all, either.\n\nAlso, OP is not going nuclear. OP is reacting accordingly, as any landlord would, to a situation that is becoming increasingly volatile. Mia has already been physically endangered, has tormented OP's pets and is now harassing OP's guests including physical conflict. Joe has had plenty of time to address this and instead blames OP for his own lack of supervision and his own inability to manage his child.\n\nThe house is OPs. Their original agreement was Mia was only there for a fraction of the time. Joe would have to move out anyway when OPs parents were ready to move in. He's just been given an early eviction.\n\n**NTA.**", "Whut? Are you high?", "it's only a half bath down there - a sink and a toilet. They use the upstairs hall bathroom for showering. The kitchenette has a fridge, sink, microwave and hot plate and is great if you meal prep in the full kitchen but it's not a good setup if you're only using the kitchenette long term", "This is 100% what went through my mind as well.", "Ah, I see. Well, I would at least try to set the boundary that they need only be upstairs if using the shower or kitchen, she certainly doesn\u2019t need to be expecting use of the living room TV at this point.", "I didn't act the way this kid does when I was 10, nor did any if my sibs or friends, and none of our parents would have let it go on. So, no, the tenant and the kid are not just normal people who don't mesh well with a landlord with a different type of lifestyle or something.", "OP has made it clear Joe blames her for what Mia is doing.", "You're not evicting a child for \"acting like a child,\" (though that description of behavior is debatable), you're evicting a parent for what sounds like repeated failure to act like a parent.\n\nObviously there's only the snapshot you're giving us, but it sounds like he either wouldn't or couldn't improve her behavior, which is heartbreaking in its own way, but she's at the point she's hurting another much younger child, so I don't see you have much other choice, friend. NTA, though you're allowed to feel for the guy.", "NTA \n\nSide note, does their bathroom have a shower? If not, it\u2019s likely not a legally rentable unit unless you let them use a spear in the main house. Former landlord here and don\u2019t want you to get to the end of this and get fucked over. Good luck!", "NTA. This is not a tenable living situation for either of you. I get where Joe is coming from, but if he was that pressed to make this living situation work, he should have attempted to make this living situation work.", "NTA.\n\nMia's a tenant too and it sounds like he's failing as a parent.", "NTA. How is it your fault that she went into your bathroom and ate your gummies that were clearly marked? She is 10, not 3. Joe doesn't want to parent, nor does his ex-wife if she is having \"major problems\" with her own daughter and her answer is to just .... not see her. This poor child. Honestly she would be better off in foster care.", "His daughter is uncontrollable and he will never hold her accountable ... for anything.\n\nNTA", "I get you feeling bad. But he\u2019s already blaming you for her consequences of her poor behavior (a result of his lack of guidance). Imagine if something worse happens. \n\nNTA. He shoulda thunk abt it when you tried to reason with him.", "NTA\n\nHis problems aren\u2019t your problems. You have your own life and people to take care of. That\u2019s your responsibility.", "NTA\n  \nIf my kid pushes someone down you can bet I will be having a very stern conversation with MY kid on why that is wrong.  \n  \nFollowed by a profuse apology from myself and my kid to the injured child (and parent). And *very* close monitoring of future interactions. Or I would limit the amount of time my child spends around yours by keeping my kid away, if that is what you would prefer.\n  \nYes. Kids act like kids. As a teacher and a parent and a former kid, every child has an AH phase. But we can't just excuse it. We have to try to make sure it only stays a phase by teaching them better behavior, learning the cause of their behaviors, and setting boundaries. \n  \nSounds like the dad did none of that.", "Parents and the child themselves are responsible for their behavior, *NOT* other people around them. His concept about his daughter\u2019s behavior / actions is inappropriate. Until / unless he can grasp that *AND* make the necessary changes, you are in legal limbo and your life is hell. \n\nNTA", "NTA. And if they rent the basement why in the hell do they have access to the rest of your house? Is there not a separate entrance for them?", "Nah let him figure it out!!\nNTA", "NTA-- you're not evicting a child for acting like a child, you're evicting a parent for not acting like a parent. That's not your fault.", "NTA 10 years old is old enough to stop making the excuse acting like a child. Temper tantrums, pushing children smaller than you, eating things which you are obviously not meant to get are all things that are unacceptable behaviour for a child of 10 years.", "NTA. Joe could have supervised his child when she was in common areas so that her behaviors didn\u2019t negatively impact the other people in the home until he was able to work with her to correct the issues. Until they leave, there is no reason for Mia to be in the common spaces unless she needs to shower.", "Nta", "NTA Joe is not your responsibility and if Joe cannot teach his daughter at 10 right from wrong then its never going to stick.", "NTA. If Mia has been given boundaries but still chooses to lie, steal, hit children half her age and generally make your life unbearable, what can you do? Her father doesn't contain her *or* reprimand her. What if those weren't fiber gummies? What if she got into pain meds instead? Joe isn't keeping her, your cats, your boyfriend's son or ANYONE safe, including himself. Yes, 10 is young. But it is old enough to understand homelessness. Maybe her father needs to drive her around and show her what happens to people that can't afford a place to live.", "NTA", "Nta.\n\nYou're evicting him because the parent won't act like the parent", "NTA. Joe needs to actually PARENT and discipline his daughter. TBH he\u2019s doing her a disservice because it IS an age where boundaries and rules make a difference.", "NTA, how convenient that Joe blames OP for evicting a child for acting like a child but can't see that he is being evicted for being a parent and not acting like a parent.", "Even if he is OP doesn\u2019t have to put up with the behaviour just because he\u2019s trying", "This last sentence is so accurate. At a certain point it could (has?) become a safety issue and a liability for all three of you.", "OP says the basement only has a half bath\u2014which for non-Americans, is a toilet and probably a sink. No shower or bath. So it would seem the tenants are using OP\u2019s bathroom with permission.", "Good comments, and Happy Cake Day! Cat lover here.....", "I\u2019ve known quite a few 10 year olds in my time. Other than finding a 5 year old a nuisance, none of those things is typical. Mia is acting out & probably would benefit from some therapy. That being said, Joe isn\u2019t parenting. He is definitely the AH here.", "Exactly this. OP isn\u2019t evicting a child for \u201cacting like a child,\u201d she\u2019s evicting her tenants for stealing from her, abusing her animals and repeatedly endangering minors and trying to hold OP liable for all of it. Even one of those things is worthy of an eviction. OP has been extremely patient and forgiving, but Jesus fucking Christ, enough is enough!", "This, exactly.  Finally, someone (you, thank you!) has put into words what I\u2019ve been trying to articulate for such a long time!!! Always trying to blame the person for being angry about a child\u2019s behavior, when really, it\u2019s the parent the person is upset with.", "Children can act like idiots. Are you satisfied now?\n\nAnd yes, while we are talking about it, children often do impulsive, irrational, and idiotic things because their prefrontal cortex is not fully developed. Children are wonderful in many ways too, but they are biologically destined to also make mistakes that need correction and continuous learning from adults and other role models to make sense of / continue healthy development. Something Mia seems to lack from Joe.", "\"Children can be idiots\"... there feel better now?", "I believe they are high. Don\u2019t know where the hell that came from.", "Well no, Joe is being evicted for not parenting his child so maybe this is his wake up call for the future, he needed to wake up and take responsibility for his actions of not letting Mia take responsibility for hers, 10 yrs old is old enough to know better. And very unpopular opinion here but this is one of the many reasons people need to stick with their marriages if it is as one Redditor  says Mia is acting up bcuz of the divorce, short of that person chasing you around with something that can seriously hurt you or  other serious serious infractions or behaviors people need to make it work, marriage can be hard work and it can be a sacrifice but if you make that commitment you need to see it through, again this only applies of course if Joe\u2019s behavior contributed to the divorce, again I know unpopular  opinion.", ">this is one of the many reasons people need to stick with their marriages if it is as one Redditor says Mia is acting up bcuz of the divorce \n\nOr \u2014 and hear me out here \u2014 instead of feeling obligated to live in silent, loveless misery for the rest of their life because someone made a mistake and legally bound themselves to the wrong person, how about divorced parents proactively provide their children with the resources and emotional support that they need to better adjust to the changes/circumstances? I mean, yeah, marriages are hard work but, even without abuse or infidelity, there are also a lot of good reasons to leave. You only get one life. \n\nI am genuinely curious, though: how would you advise long-term couples that are unmarried but have kids? A break up in that situation would have the same impact \u2014 should those couples stick it out because they had a kid, or do they get a pass to go their separate ways?\n\nETA: I grew up in a traditional Catholic family. The first divorce in my family\u2019s history was my cousin\u2019s in 2015 because of her husband\u2019s infidelity followed by mine a year later due to my ex\u2019s abuse. I saw a lot of examples of utterly unhappy people who \u201cstuck it out\u201d because they made a commitment. I tried to, too. It\u2019s a nice sentiment but in practice it breeds toxicity.", ">And very unpopular opinion here but this is one of the many reasons people need to stick with their marriages\n\noh god no. oh holy shit no. listen bud i'm a child of separated parents and no no no no no. the separation was a horrible life experience. the fighting was worse."]}
