They're not not anywhere near that point yet and it's just been sitting empty so I decided to rent it for the time being. It has 2 small bedrooms, a half bath, a kitchenette and a small sitting area. It's not well equipped enough to be fully self contained so the common spaces are still shared.\n\nI rented the space to \"Joe\" (37M) last year. Joe has an 10 year daughter \"Mia\"; the 2nd bedroom down there was hers during Joe's custody time.\n\nMia is a brat. I try not to hold it against her because she's 10 and it just is what it is, I was an ass then too but I generally like children and I go out of my way to avoid her. About 2 months ago, Mia started having major conflicts with her mom and Joe moved her in with us full time until it gets resolved.\n\nThis is not working for me. She's creating problems constantly and they're impacting my life \n\nsome examples:\n\n1. She was complaining of severe stomach pain one night and Joe took her to the ER. It was put together that she had gone into my bathroom cabinet and ate close to an entire container of my fiber gummies. Joe claims this was my fault\n2. She keeps trying to dress up my cats. She, of course, got the shit clawed out of herself and this was again my fault.\n3. She tried to take the cats on a walk and they ran from her. It took me 6 hours to find them both.\n4. She steals and uses my expensive bubble bath/bath bombs and then lies to me like I can't see the pink glitter ring in the tub.\n\nThis exploded over this week. My boyfriend's house caught fire on Friday. It's not destroyed but it'll be 4-8 weeks before they'll be able to go back so him and his 5 year old \"Gabe\" are staying with me. Mia is furious, she doesn't like that Gabe uses the living room TV when it used to be open for her. She hates that he tries to play with her. She yells at him and once pushed him and he fell down. \n\nThis is unacceptable. He has just as much right to be here as she does and Joe consistently downplays her behavior. I've had enough so today, I gave Joe notice to vacate. \n\nHe's distraught, Mia can go back to her mom's but Joe claims he can't afford a 2 bed anywhere else and he'll lose his custody time if i make him leave. He is extremely upset and told me I was an awful person to evict a child for acting like a child.

He\u2019s enabling terrible behavior by claiming she\u2019s just \u201cacting like a child.\u201d If I were you, once my pets were put in danger, I\u2019d issue the notice and never look back (not to mention the behavior toward your bf\u2019s son!). Hopefully Joe can channel his stress and desperation into working on his parenting.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like joe isn\u2019t even trying to parent his child", "NTA. One thing is her being a brat, another is the father blaming you, who shouldn\u2019t have to deal with his daughter, for stuff she does that should be his responsibility to prevent. I honestly would have drawn the line when she started bothering my pets and LOST them. Your house is not equipped for that child, so I don\u2019t blame you for your decision.", "NTA. \n\nCommon spaces are shared. Your bathroom is not a common area, she should not be in it. She\u2019s 10, she can understand this. \n\nShe causes stress to you animals and let them loose. They could have been hurt as you looked for them. Again, she\u2019s 10. She can easily understand that the cats stay inside and aren\u2019t to be dressed up. \n\nYour boyfriend and his kid take priority in your life before the tenant. Mia may live there, but it\u2019s not her house. It also doesn\u2019t sound like her dad is doing much parenting if her behavior hasn\u2019t changed in roughly a year.

Otherwise, it\u2019s time to find a new place.", "NTA\n\nYeah she's acting like a child, but her dad needs to act like an adult.\n\nEither he get out and reduce his visitation legally, or he will lose her legally, if she continues: \n\nStealing from OP's closet and eating whatever she finds, ending up in the hospital.\n\nHarassing the cats and getting noticeably injured.\n\nAttacking someone else's children.\n\nThese are all incidents that CPS would investigate, and likely removing the child and returning her to the custodial parent, if found to be the father's fault. He needs to get his shit together and work on getting himself a place, and telling the mom to get her kid in therapy.\n\nWhat is HE doing while her kid is off in OP's part of the house stealing, messing with animals and fighting with everyone else? So either she's unmonitored, or he sees it and doesn't care. Neither is a good answer.", "NTA. You are not evicting him because she is acting like a child.

A ten-year-old should definitely know better. Holy hell.\n\nI can understand Joe being distraught about the situation, but honestly, that really isn't your problem. You have to look out for yourself and those closest to you. And it definitely doesn't seem like he's actually parenting his daughter. Get them out of there before she causes you serious problems.", "NTA. He's not being a responsible parent or roommate. That's his choice, but his choices have consequences.

Unsure as to why he is blaming you for his child\u2019s actions when he, is in fact, the parent\u2026 is he not watching her and teaching her that actions have consequences?", "NTA - she is 10 that is old enough to understand no, I\u2019m sure you told her not to try and dress your cats, not to let them out, etc. If her father refused to address the behavior and blames it on you, there is nothing you can do but evict them. You rented the place to him, you were not expecting to have her full time. Don\u2019t feel bad, the father could have done something about her behavior and chose not to.", "NTA\n\nI know it\u2019s hard because it puts Joe is a rough spot, but remember that this is YOUR place.

That sounds untenable and it will not improve because her dad isn\u2019t trying at all. You deserve to be comfortable in your own house.", "NTA. He hasn't even tried to discipline Mia.

You have every right to kick them out.", "NTA.\n\nChildren are idiots, and sounds like Mia is particularly bratty -- perhaps in part owing to a lot of difficult feelings about her parents' split up. But Joe has consistently refused to discipline his child over what I think are unreasonable things to tolerate. Mia is stealing from you and harming your pets, and has even assaulted your boyfriend's child. \n\nUnfortunately Joe did not try to find an amicable solution and it is HIS behavior and poor parenting (not Mia's behavior) that has caused him to lose his housing.", "NTA. The problem is, he's trying to make up for her mother being a bad mother. And thats not the right thing. Have you considered forcing him to put her in therapy? I mean... Yeah she's a kid. But at the same time, there are certain things that she should know not to do. Such as lying. She's scared of getting in trouble, but thats a consequence to her actions. Unfortunately, he's learning a hard lesson that he needs to be her parent, not her friend.", "Could you demand him to send his daughter back to her mom while you give him enough time to find another house to relocate instead of short notice eviction.

Joe knows that Mia is causing problems, but, for whatever reason, Joe has been refusing to do the parenting required to stop the issues.

I feel bad for Joe, but he did this to himself. You haven't done anything wrong and his future housing is his own problem to deal with.", "NTA. You are not evicting Joe because his daughter acts like a child. You're doing so because he has failed to demonstrate any ability to supervise and discipline her when her actions have endangered herself, your pets and another child living in the same space, to say nothing of the lying and theft.\n\nOne of the incidents resulted in her going to the ER. Another resulted in her being scratched by cats (and how many times has that happened?). It's not clear if Gabe got hurt when pushed down, but he could have been. This is not about incidents where \"someone could have gotten hurt\". Its about incidents where someone did get hurt. Mostly his own child.\n\nYou might want to ask him what level of bodily harm it will take occurring to someone in one of these incidents for him to accept that his daughter is out of control?\n\nBut no matter his answer, he needs to find somewhere else to live while dealing with it.", "NAH.

I'm assuming they have a 30 day notice - if they show you they can get along for the first 21 days, you can let them stay. If not, they're out on the same schedule.

Harming an animal so that the cat deeply scratches the child requires intervention. That Joe deflected this responsibility of his parenting onto OP and blamed OP is madness to me.\n\nShe's not an axe murderer... but saying this is \"not that abnormal\" for a 10 year old is just not the right answer. 10 year olds can understand right from wrong. Then can understand they need to control their impulses around fragile things, like animals and smaller children. Mia seems to be missing these cues and Joe is downplaying these issues.

Find someone who is OK with a minimal kitchen and then just allow the shower acccess. Maybe a slightly lower rent but it keeps random people out of your common areas.  \n\nBut you can also just boot them out entirely.

No. Does it mean you have to be the one to deal with it in your home? Also no.
