You are condescending and cruel with it. A gentler no would have sufficed.\n\nI'm surprised your sister wants to go anywhere with you.\n\nAnd for all your classist nonsense it seems that the two doctor husbands are the source of your wealth. Did you get what in the old days was called an MRS degree? Did your brother?", "You should apologize.\n\nNot everyone is oriented for university study. Ask your brother (who just finshed his residency) about the variability of competencies and learning behaviours among people. \n\nUnfortunately, our society fails to reward with a living wage occupations for which university degrees are not required, which within our lifetimes offered income which used to be somewhat surplus to subsistence.\n\n It seems entry criteria for hanging out as a trio is not that you are family, but that everyone who attends agrees to evenly split the cost, regardless of means.\n\nSo Ms. Smarty Pants critical thinker.

Idk Jim's situation, but higher education is unfortunately out of reach for some people.

It clearly upsets her and since you are unwilling to help pay for her to come along on one, its kinda rude to talk about it when you know the financial status of your sister and you know it bugs her.

OP is in her position because of better choices not fortune.", "You can marry for love and still be practical. Love is important, but in a marriage it is not the ONLY thing. One must be realistic about the life one will have with any given partner.", ">There are plenty of people who do not go to university and make much more than college educated.\n\nI'd guess that probably is accurate that there are \"plenty\". Depending on what plenty is to you 12 or 30. But the reality is that more (notice I didn't say ALL) people who get a college degree in general make more than those who don't.  There are some great trade jobs; carpenters, steel workers, plumbers, electricians. There are some terrible college degrees; underwater basket weaving, art history or archeology (I actually thought about that for a long while).", "While I would reject the \"MRS\" slur, I will not pretend that marrying men who were 10-ish years older and doctors did not help our financial positions. That being said, we both have graduate degrees and both work full-time.", "Her brother isn't even the doctor either, he also married one", "Can you imagine being her server in a restaurant? Her housekeeper? Her cashier at the store? Yikes!", "My brother got more money than me not even once have I thought to say \"chip in\" I ain't taken money from my mum or him in my adult life", "Shame \ud83d\ude12", "She met her husband when the husbands(hers and brothers) went to school together.\n\nRenting a house is renting a vacation house for a month", "HAHAHA! No we went to uni together (many years ago now) and we rent a vacation home together once a year. The other 11 months we live in our own houses.", "She has asked for us to pay her way in the past, including on two skiing holidays and for a Christmas trip where Tim and I paid for our mum. She was headed in that direction when I cut her off.\n\nAs for the pity party, you cannot talk to her without hearing about how hard her life is, how physically demanding their jobs are, and how little money they have. We grew up fairly affluently and obviously she doesn't live that way anymore. She is very unhappy about that.", "It seems like OP takes satisfaction in delivering the message, which on its own makes her an asshole.", "OP didn\u2019t say what they do, and they may well have a brilliant and successful career, but the only context and choice that she tells us she and her brother made was to marry doctors.", "My sister and I had the same surface level opportunities but I am much better off. My sister had internal struggles I could never understand or relate to, and people are just different. Not every single person is capable of the same thing. How can one not have empathy for their own sister (unless something horrible happened ofc)?", "Yeah, marry rich instead and then you can sneer at The Poors with your equally unkind doctor hubby.", "Jesus Christ you sound absolutely insufferable.", "In other words, you married for money. Got it.", "Garbage person", "Big \u201cI snap at waiters to get their attention\u201d energy.", "If I'm not mistaken - it sounds like your sister ALSO works full time (and doesn't take random months off).  It could be argued that she works a lot harder than you.  You should be ashamed of yourself for treating other people with such disrespect just because you married a sugar daddy.", "You\u2019re so gross,  .. freeloading off of your rich husbands and acting like you\u2019re better than your sister. Total garbage person", "1) mrs isnt a slur babe get it together lol. 2) sounds like your sister works a whole lot harder than you.. you get to take a month off work to vacation while your sister is going to be working her ass off through august as it seems like she does every other month. your husbands dont have to fund her vacation, but your wording was disrespectful and condescending. you and your brother are some pretty awful siblings-looking down on your sister because she didnt marry rich, i mean come on", "SLUR?? This has to be fake. No way a real person would say this.", "MRS isn\u2019t a slur jfc", "I have a master\u2019s degree and am aware enough to know that college degrees do not make me better, or smarter, than those without. Get over yourself. Seems like you\u2019re an opportunist with an ego problem.", "Do you work?", "People who went to university together and hate on folks with a GED can't write in the past tense and can't write well enough to keep husbands straight? \n\nThese same wildly successful folks live together and shit on other people?", "And does your sister ever get to go or do you just dislike her so much you couldn't be bothered to include her in a sibling vacation?", "Well, I get not wanting to pay someone's way, and being annoyed that they'd ask.  But you were absolutely the ASSHOLE with the way you responded.\n\nBut the rest of your posts just reek of snobby, entitled classism.  YTA.    There are all kinds of people out there without college educations who are great and \\*gasp\\* even very intelligent.\n\nI'm surprised she'd even want to go somewhere with you, considering the attitude you have.  \n\nGOOD DAY MADAM.", "Her life probably is hard and her job probably is physically demanding.  You\u2019re her family.

Maybe she is a lazy parasite, or maybe she was dealing with some things that knocked her off course.", "Thankyou! Not everyone is suited to higher studies and heavy careers. I know I've tried university, and TAFE, my mental health gets in the way. \nI always appreciate a person who can see this, and acknowledge it!", "She does not", "Yep, that sums it up.\n\nEdit:  They don't live together, even though her writing style doesn't make that clear.  The two older siblings rent a vacation house for the whole month of August each year.", "Some wildly successful people are assholes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd lot of families with money rent executive houses, especially when it\u2019s the main time they spend together.   Not defending op but it\u2019s not unheard of.  I live in a tourist local and some of the executive houses for summer rental are rented by people with money who enjoy their relatives more than most lol", "It's not like she's incessantly demanding things, god forbid someone feels down for not being able to do expensive stuff with their family", "There is often a difference between people who beg no matter how much you abide, and those who beg even though you never abide.", "She said she works full time. She's a total asshole who married rich, but she does work.", "She literally said she works full-time.", "Does she take care of kids?", "What full time job is only 11 months a year? Do you know what full time means?\n\n\nAlso, OP is a garbage person", "Don't wildly educated people write better than this?", "It doesn't ring true. Lol.", "Taking a month off.

Came here when I was 13.", "And you got an advanced degree but still can't write? Come on, dude.", "My mom immigrated here when she was 18 and got a GED.
