It\u2019s not \u201cfancy stuff\u201d it\u2019s basically a type of medicine used to treat a condition. The niece will live. Clearly there\u2019s not a good relationship between him and his mom if he couldn\u2019t ask her about it, so I\u2019m glad you were there to help", "NTA. Just because one sibling wants, and asks you for, a medicated product doesn't mean that you have to buy the one who didn't ask for any one as well.  This is especially the case because the only reason you were involved is that the niece mocked the nephew. No reward for that.", "Tell your sister that this is treating a physical issue.

Did you talk to him about why he can't ask his parents?", "Nta at all but I am curious why you opted for the $30-$40 bottle of high end shampoo instead of picking up a bottle of Neutrogena or head & shoulders. Not that there's anything wrong with l'occitane, it just is really really expensive", "NTA. Unless you are in the habit of getting your nephew a lot of things he asks for and ignoring your niece in the meantime.", "NTA, you are not buying your nephew a gift, you are giving him what he needs for an issue he has.

Also everyone is wigging out about the price, but I looked it up in USD and it seems like it's a normal price per ounce for the typical specialty shampoo.

Why do people freak out so bad over giving kids nice stuff, I don't get it :/", "NTA. Your nephew came to you because he\u2019s not comfortable with asking his own mother for a medically necessary item.  That\u2019s her failure as a mother.

A bottle of head and shoulders is 5 euros, anti dandruff, and \"manly\" but that isn't any of the issues..", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is a gimmee gimmee.
