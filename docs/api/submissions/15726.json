Up until recently we both lived at home. I was fortunate enough to buy my first place recently, with the help of my parents (mom is a realtor).\n\nI am supposed to move into my place at the end of the month. My bf and I were talking and he brought up the idea of letting him move into my place with me, and us living together. He said that he'd obviously pitch in with bills and everything. Now I was hesitant about this for a few reasons.\n\n\\- Whenever he comes over to my families house now, it's like picking up after a child. He's constantly leaving dirty dishes on the counter, food wrappers wherever, water bottles wherever etc. I'm constantly having to remind him \"hey can you please throw this out?\", \"hey can you please put your dish in the sink\", but nothing ever seems to stick.\n\n\\- He's never lived on his own before and had to fend for himself. Like not even when he went to college, he's always lived at home. For example in my current situation yes i live with my family, but I live in the basement. I fend for myself as in I buy my own groceries, cook my own meals etc. In his case sure he knows how to cook, but ne never buys his own groceries and stuff and mainly just eats what his mom makes, or whatever's in the house. \n\n\\- Ever since we first got together two years ago, he has always complained how he hates his job. He calls in sick all the time because he hates it and doesn't feel like going. Yet he has not made an effort to find something new, that he enjoys doing. This makes me nervous because I don't want someone fending off me.\n\n\\- I really also enjoy and value my alone time, hence why I decided to stay home and save as opposed to moving out somewhere with roommates\n\nNow when I explained my reasonings to my bf, he immediately got defensive. I'm sure some of my reasonings were a hit to his ego, but it's the truth and these things need to be addressed before we just rush into moving in together. He cut the conversation short and just started saying \"forget it, just drop the conversation I just won't move in with you\".\n\nHe's been dry and bitter to me ever since, and sulking around. \n\nI feel like kind of an AH but at the same time I'm not just going to let these issues go like he clearly wants me too. I feel bad because I know he wants to get out of his crowded living situation, but I stand by what I said. AITA for not letting him move in with me?", "created_utc": 1682517420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zie20/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_bf_of_two_years_move/", "score": 434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(But even better because he gets to have sex with you), what a deal!\n\nBut you have an idea of what is to come and you said no to him moving in. Because you are smart. \n\nDo you really see a future with this guy? Read your own post like somebody else wrote it. NTA", "NTA. All your reasons sound perfectly valid for not wanting him as a housemate. But they also sound like valid reasons for why the relationship won't go anywhere?", "NTA. You're incompatible. He is 26, he is not going to change. He is looking for another Mommy.", "NTA.  Rethink this relationship.  The two of you are in entirely different places in your life.  He's still acting like a teenager and you're moving on to adult world.  It is beyond rude to go into somebody's home and behave the way he has.  You KNOW if he lived with you he would be worse - you would be picking up after him 24/7. He would not work so you'd be paying the bills. And he's already shown that you can't discuss problems with him because he pouts.  Don't let him move in.  You'll just be his new Mom.", "NTA - but do you see this relationship going anywhere? It seems you both aren\u2019t compatible and atleast you know that. Would be better to move on rather than just stringing him along", "GUUURL trust me, not the asshole. In fact it sounds a lot like he is trying to take advantage of your housing situation and emotionally manipulating you. If he moves in it would only get worse.... what if he is short on money, is he expecting you to cover? Can you trust him to even keep up with the bills and the cleaning? You cant even have a conversation about boundaries without him acting up\n\nAt the very least I would say move in first alone and while he is hanging there you can see if his attitudes change...\n\nI love alone time too! I have my own place, a roomie and my bf spends a long time there too. He cleans after himself, does the dishes with me when we cook... and never once complained when I express any concern. He is in fact overly worries of desrespecting me or my space. And i can still find time to do my thing. Its all about boundaries and people who respect them <3\n\nHonestly, drop the guy and find yourself a better one you deserve it! (Easier said than done i know but I hope this comment can help you see how you are being mistreated here)", "NTA, but good gravy, why are you with this guy.", "You're NTA no self respecting man will beg his girlfriend to live together. He wants to mooch a  place to stay while disrespecting your boundaries. You said it yourself he's been dry and bitter ever since. That behavior will 100% translate into every disagreement and spat you two have living together. This 'man' showed you his true colors, please find a better and real man.", "NTA - If he is not even willing to have a conversation about these issues, then he is definitely not going to work on these issues.", "NTA. You have reasonable expectations, and he has shown you that you may not be able to count on him. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like it may be time for a TALK. At some point, a relationship gets to the place where moving in together is the next logical step. If that\u2019s a non-starter for you, it might be time to re-consider the relationship as a whole.", "NTA, but why are you with a man who can't even show basic respect to a household he doesn't live in?\n\nIt's not wild after 2 years of dating to want to consider moving in together, nor is it wild to have criteria for someone you want to live with. But if after two years, a grown adult man at 26 can't figure out how to not even be a guest in someone's home, I doubt he'll be a great person to live with.", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, him moving in sounds like a recipe for disaster.\n\nBetween you having to ask him to do really simple things repetitively in your family home (where you would really hope he would be even more on top of things than in his own space) to him being unreliable in terms of work...I could see him leaving/loosing his job and you having to choose between kicking him out and providing for him. \n\nIt speaks volumes that he's not even ready to have a conversation about your reasons. For him to then not address those things with you, but to end the conversation and sulk...no no.\n\nYou're not the AH here and he clearly has some issues he needs to work on.", "NTA... and it sounds like it's time for you to really do some reflecting on what you want out of relationships going forward. It's ok to realize you've outgrown someone, especially at such a young age. \n\nTry this. Imagine yourself in a relationship with him 5 years from now. He still doesn't pick up after himself. He still doesn't cook, or grocery shop, or \"adult\". He's quit multiple jobs because he just didn't like them, with months of unemployment in between where you're expected to pay for everything because if you don't he acts bitter and dry and sulking toward you. You're expected to mother him, take on the bulk of household chores, pay for everything... and do it with a smile on your face.\n\nIs that the life you want for yourself? What if a friend was in that life - what would you advise your friend to do?", "NTA - You have every right to your own space and wanting that space to be clean and tidy, its your house you can make whatever choice you want. But also I will say - These are issues you will have to address... regardless of when it is. So you need to think about whether you want to be with him or not... because reality is saying you dont want to live together, is gonna starting pushing your relationship down that slope.", "NTA and congratulations on being this sensible and clear-sighted at your age. I know people in their 50s who can't set healthy boundaries for themselves.", "NTA but I get the feeling that bf is an aspiring hobosexual. You let him move in and that job will be gone really quick and you\u2019ll end up funding his lifestyle as well as doing everything around the house on your own.", "NTA and girl. I\u2019m so PROUD of you.  You did the hardest thing which is to stand up for yourself.  You addressed the issues and were  until you can prove these will no longer be issues you can\u2019t move in! \nSo many people can\u2019t do this and you can at your young age! If I was your mom, I would be that\u2019s my girl!", "NTA. I wouldn't want to live with these issues, either. He's not entitled to your new space just because you've been dating a couple of years. Though if he doesn't change...this is not something you'd be happy with long-term.", "NTA but by your list of cons i gotta wonder why are you with this guy?", "NTA but it kind of seems like you\u2019ve outgrown this guy.", "NTA - this sounds like there be a post soon of AITA if i kicked my boyfriend out or about your relationship. It sounds a bit like he is to taken care of by his family.", "NTA. It sounds like he needs to learn how to be an adult as opposed to another responsibility for you to have to deal with.", "NTA, but there are tons of red flags waving here, are you sure this relationship is going somewhere? I'd seriously rethink that as these are major incompatibility problems that are likely not resolvable - he was clearly raised differently than you and, even if he manages to change for a short while, those habits are engrained and he will likely slip right back into them over time.", "NTA moving in with someone is a privilege, not a right, and he hasn't earned that privilege yet. You have very valid reasons for not wanting him to move in; he can either take what you said to heart and work on himself, or he can continue to pout like a child.", "NTA - You have legitimate concerns about him moving in with you.  It is clear that you and he need to work some of this out before you take your relationship to that level.  Living together requires a lot of give and take and if you already can see red flags, you will need to deal with those before you can live in the same place.\n\nGreat opportunity for you to evaluate what you want to do with your future overall.", "NTA It is your house so you decide who you do and don't live with. With that said I have to ask. Where do you see this relationship going? Where do you see yourself with him 5 years from now? If this guy is not worth moving in with after 2 years do you really see yourself taking the next big step of ever marrying him? I guess my point is if you are not going to drop it and he is not going to change, is this where you two part ways?", "NTA - he can't even act right as a guest in your house now. Why would it be any better if he's living with you permanently?\n\nI let my ex move in when he'd been living at home. He had lived away for school, but moved back as many of us have done. He started out better than what you're describing and was always helpful when he was over at my place initially. Then I had him move in. Slowly things shifted because \"I don't own this so like it's not my house. If we break up you've just made money off me.\"\n\nCalling in sick to work constantly...how much if a hit to his pay is that? What are the odds he'd just quit and mooch off you?\n\nTo me, the risk isn't worth it and I'd be re-evaluating the relationship in general if he's this immature and stuck in a loop while you're moving forward.", "NTA! You are so mature and smart to have such valid concerns. If I could redo life I would\u2019ve NEVER EVER lived with a man who hadn\u2019t lived on his own first. Men need to live alone to know what it means to take care of a space independently and to clean properly. Let him know it would be so beneficial for him to have that experience, even if way less convenient.", "NTA! He is 26. He needs to grow and go from his parents' place. And not into yours. I can almost guarantee that once he is in, he quits his job. You didn't give birth to him. You don't have to raise him. And that's what you would be doing. \n\nYou sound like you have a great handle on things at your age. At 22, I knew that I was still floundering in this world. Please don't let him move in and leech off of you.", "NTA. Do not let this guy move in!! \n\nHe needs to figure his own life out first. Sounds like he doesn't take responsibility for himself and he needs to do that before imposing on you. Seriously though, the things you describe are huge character flaws or at least immaturity. It sounds like the two of you are incompatible. And shouldn't even be dating much less moving in together.", "NTA. All the reasons you\u2019ve listed really make it seem like there\u2019s not much of a future for him and you. He\u2019s in desperate need of life skills, and you are not his mother. If he were to move in with you, you may very well end up miserable and stuck in an even more difficult situation. \n\nYou could simply state that he needs to live on his own for awhile before you\u2019re comfortable moving in together. Or you could take a moment to consider whether this right man for you.", "NTA.\n\nbut if you can't imagine yourself living with him EVER, then it doesn't sound like the relationship is gonna work. especially considering his age, i doubt he'll change much.\n\nyou two just seem like you're on different paths.", "NTA and depending on the rules where you live, him moving in and chipping in with costs may count as living common law after a while, which would give him a whole other set of claims on you. You're young, so you really shouldn't be rushing in on something like that (even if there weren't other concerns).\n\nIt kind of sounds like his parents never really made him clean up after himself and so he's never learned. There may be different standards of tidiness at play too, but I suspect the former. You can suggest that he tries living on his own for a while before reconsidering moving in but that's entirely up to you.\n\nAlso, I know a lot of people expect it, but you don't have to move in with someone in order to date them long term. You do need to figure out whether that matters to you though.", "When someone shows you who they are, believe them. If you let him move in, you'll be on the hook for an immature moocher.", "NTA. That's a big NOPE! Moving in with him is setting yourself up for failure.  This is your first place and you will have more than enough to manage without carrying him.  And trust me, he's looking to be carried.", "NTA it sounds like your bf isn't mature enough to live with a partner yet", "NTA but rethink this relationship. He sounds very inmature, despiste being 4 years your senior. I think you deserve better. If you let him live with you, you will end up being both the breadwinner and his maid.", "NTA. You\u2019ve planned, worked and organised in order to get your own place and he is perfectly capable of doing the same. He doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s housebroken, and the sulking proves he\u2019s immature. I suspect he would soon quit his job and mooch off you and it would be very difficult to get him out. Stick to your boundaries - it sounds like you\u2019ve made a mature and responsible decision. And after you\u2019ve moved into your new home make it clear that it\u2019s your home and your standards - he cleans up after himself and respects your property.", "You need a better BF\u2026NTA.", "NTA. You need to do what's best for you. It sounds as if you'd end up taking care of him if he were to move in with you.", "NTA, but think about how if you don't want to live with him then why are you with him?", "Sounds like you need to have this conversation whether he moves in or not. It sounds like he's coasting, and if your futures don't align in terms of goals and ambitions, it is going to be bad. Whether it's now or ten years from now.  NTA", "NTA- you\u2019re a smart cookie .\n\nLet him sulk. \n\nHim not even wanting to talk about things means he has no intention to change and will fully expect you to take care of him .", "NTA but you seem like you\u2019re in a place where you seriously have to evaluate if this is someone you see in your life moving forward. You just highlighted multiple reasons why you don\u2019t feel comfortable taking the \u201cnext step\u201d in your relationship. You\u2019ve been with him for two years now, do you think he has the potential to make changes that you\u2019d feel comfortable moving in together? Because that\u2019s something you should consider before investing more time in the relationship.", "INFO: How are you thinking you're an asshole in this?  There's no mandate to move in together in any relationship, and the discussion was civil.", "NTA, it\u2019s your place \n\nSounds like you aren\u2019t sure about continuing the relationship though", "NTA But as a general tip don't date people you would never consider moving in with (there's the chance emotions could develop which make you waive away all the red flags).", "NTA 100 times!\n\nI think you are very intelligent for paying attention to his big red flags.\n\n He ABSOLUTELY needs to show you he can live on his own for at least a year before you guys move in together (most people can fake anything for six months, it has to be a year).", "So basically he wants to be independent by leaving his mom and then letting you do the work. It's great for him and horrible for you. Don't do it", "Oh gosh. Nta but why are you with him?? It feels like there\u2019s a major disparity in your relationship and it won\u2019t necessarily get better. He needs to grow up a little and live on his own as well", "NTA but with that being said, where are you planning for this relationship to go if that's how you feel about living with him?", "NTA. Sorry but this relationship is going nowhere but divorce court.  He needs to grow up before he's ready for a relationship.", "NAH\n\nBut why are you still dating this guy if you don't want to live with him after two years together? Do you plan on living separately forever?", "NTA he's acting like a child to try and get his way. Font let him move in and maybe consider if this is really the kind of partner you want long term because he probably isn't going to change. Congrats on your new place, enjoy your alone time and personal space", "Do not let him move in with you. You will regret it if you do, trust me.", "NTA. He's 26 years old. That's not a kid, he's a grown adult who still lives with mammy and can't clean up after himself. Get rid and get a dog, there is no future here.", "NTA, and very smart of you to bring up what will/will not be acceptable in terms of living conditions if he were to move in. It sounds like your BF still has a lot of growing up to do before moving in with you. \n\nHonestly, what I\u2019m more concerned with is his job situation. If he is so unhappy that he is calling in sick like that, he needs to find a new job. I\u2019m glad this factored into your reasoning and I\u2019m glad you told him that was a reason. Complacency in a job like that makes you super unhappy and tends to affect other areas of your life as well.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m sure you have been told this multiple times already\u2026but if/when he moves in, do not add him to the deed/mortgage. Keep it in your name only and have him pay you rent.", "You wrote out your (very valid) concerns above, very directly and easy to understand. It also seems like you\u2019ve communicated those things to your boyfriend. You\u2019re seeing his true self, but hoping your suggestions will stick or change. Stick to your guns about not letting him move in. You know how you\u2019ll be comfortable and he\u2019s not respecting those boundaries. Obviously nta!!", "NTA, stand your ground! You're clear-headed and that's a very good and important thing to have.", "NTA. \n\nI would also be hesitant to move in with someone who doesn't clean up after themselves, let alone the other issues. \n\nMaybe let him know about your observations at the relatives and such, and make a deal with him. If he improves that behaviour, you will consider allowing him to move in. It's your house, so this could happen at any given time.", "NTA, definitely.  I'd ask him what the rush is.  Tell him you're not saying you two will never live together, but you're not ready.\n\nThat gives you time to live on your own, and assuming he'll be over a lot, see how he treats your place.  He can either grow up a bit, maybe show he's more responsible without his mommy around, or else show he'll be the same person.  Then you'll have all the information you need to decide on your future.\n\nSo just tell him it's not a \"no forever\" it's just a \"no for now.\"  If he can't understand that, that's on him, not you.", "NTA - you don\u2019t want to move in a failure to launch albatross.", "NTA, smart move. This is a chance for him to grow, or for you to flourish away from him.", "NTA, but please be aware this will likely be the end of your relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound like you two are in the same place at this point in your lives.", "NTA It's time move on.", "NTA - all your reasons are reasonable.  \nHe is 26 yo but he still has a lot of growing up to do.\n\nOnce you move in to your home, notice how he treats your home and belongings.  If he continues as he is now, have a discussion with him and reiterate that in no way will he be moving in with him having the expectation of you being his maid.\nThat if he ever wants the chance then he needs to grow up and start being responsible and taking care of himself.  If he continues to disrespect you and your things, then you need to decide how much you want him to be in your life or if it\u2019s time to end it and find someone your more compatible with.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want to you don't need to escalate your relationship by moving in together.", "NTA follow your instincts because they are on point. He\u2019s pissed because you know him for who he is. Stay strong and enjoy your best life. You have a good head on your shoulders. He can do some growing up, or not. It won\u2019t be your headache", "NTA, any one of your reasons are individually enough. I've lived with exes that were like this, and trust me, it doesn't change and is not worth the stress.", "NTA.  Time to move on", "OMG! Finally! A young woman who hasn\u2019t lost the plot within her relationship.\n\nOP, you are NTA. Truly, definitely not the AH. You have extremely sound reasoning for not having your boyfriend move in with you. He absolutely needs to step up and learn to adult on his own for a while before he will be capable of being a true partner. If he can\u2019t see the wisdom in your reasoning then I would say he\u2019s got a lot of maturing to do at 26 years old. \n\nYou aren\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be expected to continue to parent him and it looks as if that\u2019s what he might\u2019ve wanted. And since he\u2019s being so petulant about your refusal, take a hard look at his actions once he does get his own place. Is he going to keep it neat on his own? Is he going to make sure his bills and his credit remain stable? Will he understand the necessity of saving and will he consistently show up for his job? I am guessing no, but he might surprise you.\n\nIn any case, remain firm and don\u2019t let him move in on the sneak tip. You know, leaving his things at your home constantly or being there so often that he try to tell you that he\u2019s already there so much that you may as well let him stay. Keep firm boundaries with him. Don\u2019t let him be there more than 3 times a week. Never allow him to receive mail at your home. Don\u2019t give him a key. And do not allow him access to your SSN, bank accounts, or financial information. Don\u2019t loan him money and make sure you note how often his parents have to give him money.\n\nThe reason why I say these things is because you don\u2019t want to let him set himself up as a tenant and because you need to see some major growth in regards to how he handles his responsibilities before you can even think of moving forward with him.\n\nHonestly? You already show way more maturity, wisdom, and emotional stability than a man four years older than you and I personally think that you can do better. You need someone on your level.", "At 22 you stand up for yourself and stick to what you will and won\u2019t accept. You Rock Star! You did nothing wrong He\u2019s a big baby.", "NTA. He sounds like he\u2019s angling for a job as a hobosexual. He claims he\u2019ll help with bills (just bills, not paying rent) but he hates his job and won\u2019t look for a new one. I\u2019ve dealt with that - it leads to an unemployed leech. Also won\u2019t clean up after himself, and isn\u2019t capable of any actual adulting skills.\n\nIf you let him move in, within a few months you\u2019ll be coming home from work to a trashed house to an unemployed guy sitting on the couch who isn\u2019t even looking for a job. \n\nPlease, don\u2019t let him move in.", "You guys have completely opposite lifestyles and habits, you are lucky if this relationship ends due to this incident, find yourself a better partner buddy", "NTA. Why are with him? He doesn't clean up after himself even at someone else's house, he doesn't take care of himself, he doesn't like his job but won't look for something better. It doesn't sound like he contributes anything to this relationship and now he wants to sponge off of you. You've outgrown him, time to move on.", "NTA so just to be clear, to prove to you how mature and ready to live with you his is - he is sulking like a toddler?\n\nYou sound like you are in different places and maturity in your lives. Perhaps have a think about the future of this relationship.\n\nAlso, Congratulations of buying your first home!!!!!", "NTA. This is your line in the sand. His attitude really seals the me deal. Enjoy your new home, roommate free. He\u2019s not ready for such a move.", "Nopes. Not at all. NTA all the way. \n\nJust keep him around till you find someone you would like to settle with. Men like him are a dime a dozen and only good for arm candy.", "NTA - your house so your decision. However, you should be able to find a solution if the two of you are ever gonna live together.", "You\u2019ve have good boundaries. Have you shared your concerns with him and why? Also he sounds like he still has growing to do. I say your boundaries are healthy, but definitely share your reasons with him so that he can understand if you haven\u2019t already. If you haven\u2019t. Be kind. I know this goes without saying but talk to him like you love him. GL also NTA", "I'm going NAH.\n\nYou aren't obliged to live with him especially if you are concerned he will take advantage of your time (cleaning up after him) and money (unreliable worker). Those are excellent reasons to be wary.\n\nHowever, if I were 2 years into a relationship with someone that wasn't interested in living with me for even a trial period, I would be seriously rethinking that relationship. Which would probably show through in me being dry and bitter. Granted the words \"Nevermind. Just drop this (important conversation)\" would never come out of my mouth!", "NAH.\n\nYou have good reasons not to live with bf that mostly add up to him being kind of immature and a slob. His response to your explanation is also immature.  You're right to want to have your own space. You've worked hard to get your own place and you deserve to enjoy it as you please.\n\nYour bf needs to live on his own and take care of his own needs for a year or 2 before he's a good candidate for cohabitation.", "NAH. I\u2019m not going to comment on y\u2019all\u2019s relationship\u2014I\u2019m coming from a broader perspective.\n\n Ultimately, relationships are a series of steps you take with another person. You have to both want the same things. You\u2019ve hit a step in your relationship that you don\u2019t want to go past. You don\u2019t want to move in with him right now. He wants to go to the next step of the relationship and live with you. There\u2019s a mismatch in yalls wants out of this relationship.

Up until recently we both lived at home. I was fortunate enough to buy my first place recently, with the help of my parents (mom is a realtor).\n\nI am supposed to move into my place at the end of the month. My bf and I were talking and he brought up the idea of letting him move into my place with me, and us living together. He said that he'd obviously pitch in with bills and everything. Now I was hesitant about this for a few reasons.\n\n\\- Whenever he comes over to my families house now, it's like picking up after a child. He's constantly leaving dirty dishes on the counter, food wrappers wherever, water bottles wherever etc. I'm constantly having to remind him \"hey can you please throw this out?\", \"hey can you please put your dish in the sink\", but nothing ever seems to stick.\n\n\\- He's never lived on his own before and had to fend for himself. Like not even when he went to college, he's always lived at home. For example in my current situation yes i live with my family, but I live in the basement. I fend for myself as in I buy my own groceries, cook my own meals etc. In his case sure he knows how to cook, but ne never buys his own groceries and stuff and mainly just eats what his mom makes, or whatever's in the house. \n\n\\- Ever since we first got together two years ago, he has always complained how he hates his job. He calls in sick all the time because he hates it and doesn't feel like going. Yet he has not made an effort to find something new, that he enjoys doing. This makes me nervous because I don't want someone fending off me.\n\n\\- I really also enjoy and value my alone time, hence why I decided to stay home and save as opposed to moving out somewhere with roommates\n\nNow when I explained my reasonings to my bf, he immediately got defensive. I'm sure some of my reasonings were a hit to his ego, but it's the truth and these things need to be addressed before we just rush into moving in together. He cut the conversation short and just started saying \"forget it, just drop the conversation I just won't move in with you\".\n\nHe's been dry and bitter to me ever since, and sulking around. \n\nI feel like kind of an AH but at the same time I'm not just going to let these issues go like he clearly wants me too. I feel bad because I know he wants to get out of his crowded living situation, but I stand by what I said.
