But for now, we all deal with it. \n\nHowever, ever since the weather warmed up, my husband has started just going outside into the backyard and peeing behind the shed.

Im lucky if the single bathroom we have is open for me to use when i need to. I wish i just had problems like this.", "Make him change spots so its not in one place.

The solution for this is going outside.\n\nWe're both well hydrated so no pee-smell, and there's a certain amount of good in pee that helps out plants (a combo of fermented nettles and urine is a great plant fertiliser even if it does reek like sweaty sports bag) so I see no harm in this.\n\nHaving said that I can see why you don't like it and itvs an acceptable thing to ask him to stop, especially as you do have available bathrooms", "YTA.. let the pee outside. who is hurting?", "YTA / if no one is harmed, it shouldn\u2019t matter", "I find it personally insulting for someone to piss on my house,  shed or my property in general.

I don't want the school sending him home or saying he can't come back until he is peeing only in the toilet. \n\nOur school district is very strict on \"your child must be potty trained\", unless they have special needs. \n\nDo not teach this \"trick\" to your son's! (I'm aware most men will pee outside at least sometimes. I'm a woman and I have peed outside in an emergency! But you need to make sure you are stressing the part about ONLY in an emergency.)", "My first thought was \u201cGod, that\u2019s gonna reek of piss\u201d", "Urine alone is too strong. In highschool I lived in a fraternity-like house and I spent a few weeks peeing out my window. There was a big thick bush there that completely died, let alone the grass.", "The \"Pee as fertilizer\" thing was the first thing to come to mind for me too, but you want to dilute that stuff... you can use like a cup of urine (at most) in a big watering can and water your plants with... as long as you don't take any meds.\n\nBut undiluted as everyone is pointing out, is some strong stuff.", "It also keeps away snakes. Or so I\u2019ve been told.. I could google this and find out, but I will just keep believing it I think. \n\npissing in the backyard has never been weird to me, but where I grew up everyone has massive yards with forest surrounding it, so they probably don\u2019t piss on the exact same spot every time. And also the only time you piss outside you are already doing something else there.", "I was wondering about this. I\u2019m wondering if they are far away from any neighbors or if he just thinks it is a blind spot. They might live out in a rural area. But if not \ud83d\ude35\n\nLet me tell you, it may be a blind spot from any view you have but that doesn\u2019t mean a slight angle change from a different house. Our neighbor across the ally behind could clearly see everything in our back yard and we realized it when she ratted out another neighbor for cutting flowers and always knew what we were up to. The slight uphill was great for her.", "Thats generally what you say when someone does not close a door behind them", "Lol. This guy isn't walking 30 feet to use an indoor bathroom (one of three) he surely ain't digging a hole every time.", "This doesn't paint Aussies in a great light and sets the bar pretty low. You'd rather your husband pee in the backyard than use indoor plumbing properly like a civilized person, and respectful member of the household?", "Finally someone with some sense. I pee in the back yard all the time. Who gives a shit?", "No, he\u2019s definitely not shitting back there, at least.", "There is no real impact on me. I just think it\u2019s so silly to do it when we have three functioning bathrooms in our home. \n\nThat\u2019s why I keep wondering if ITA. Because it bugs the shit out of me but deep down I know it\u2019s not really a big deal.", "The smell and also it's unsanitary", "Indeed, you don't need to flush every time you pee, especially in dry weather.\n\nThe smell is a real concern though.", "The people in this thread strike me as people who have never actually known someone who pees outside regularly. It doesn\u2019t magically start smelling unless it\u2019s literally every piss from every human in the house.", "Probably just the French", "Bot", "\ud83d\ude02", "Cheapest fertilizer check out my garden posts npk value is great for plants and alot of trace elements, personally I'd get him a nice piss jug or just let him have his piss corner a very soft yta", "Take my angry upvote!", "Does he have bad knees? It would be a problem for me if I had to climb 14 stairs every time I needed to pee.    \n\n\nMy spouse peeing in the yard wouldn't bother me under the conditions described, as long as it didn't smell.    \n\n\nWould it help to think of his behavior as conserving water? (Fewer flushes)", "If it has no impact on you, just let him do it.", "You can 100% tell the toilets that people \u201cyellow leave it mellow\u201d in though\u2026 they stain and smell pretty quickly and people don\u2019t notice because they get used to it. I\u2019ve lived in houses with both opinions, flush every time, and only flush with #2, you absolutely can tell the difference.", "It\u2019s like peeing in the shower. Everyone does it, they just lie about it", "Yeah my verdict would be NAH or YTA so it all being NTA is boggling my mind"]}
