Our house has a weird layout and there\u2019s no bathroom right next to any of those rooms. If anyone is in one of those rooms and needs to use the bathroom, they either have to walk through our main bedroom on the ground floor and use our en-suite, walk upstairs and use the kids\u2019 bathroom, or go down into the finished basement and use the powder room. It\u2019s not ideal and we plan on adding a powder room to the ground floor at some point. But for now, we all deal with it. \n\nHowever, ever since the weather warmed up, my husband has started just going outside into the backyard and peeing behind the shed. Our back door is right near all the rooms where he spends time during the day so he says it\u2019s just quicker and easier. \n\nI hate that he does this and have asked him to stop but he says that it\u2019s not a big deal because none of the neighbors can see (true), nobody can see it from our house (true), our kids don\u2019t know he does this (true) and he\u2019s not ruining the grass because he\u2019s just peeing in the dirt behind the shed (true).  \n\nHe\u2019s honestly an incredible partner and father and this is literally my only complaint about him. And he\u2019s right in that his peeing out back isn\u2019t hurting anything. It just bugs me that he won\u2019t take 60 extra seconds to walk to an actual toilet. \n\nAITA for asking him to stop? Should I just let it go since it\u2019s really not causing any harm?\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. It doesn\u2019t smell bad out there, at least not yet, and he\u2019s done it at least 2x a day for a few months now. \n2. We keep a bottle of hand sanitizer on the table by the back door and he uses it when he comes in. \n3. We\u2019re confident that the neighbors and the kids can\u2019t see him. And the kids never go back in that area. \n\nAnd despite the fact that most of the votes here are NTA, I\u2019ve decided not to die on this hill and just let it go.  I told him that as long as he never does it while the kids are out there, then I won\u2019t bug him about it.", "created_utc": 1690114613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157ddcs/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stop_peeing_in_the/", "score": 1282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Im lucky if the single bathroom we have is open for me to use when i need to. I wish i just had problems like this.", "Make him change spots so its not in one place.

The solution for this is going outside.\n\nWe're both well hydrated so no pee-smell, and there's a certain amount of good in pee that helps out plants (a combo of fermented nettles and urine is a great plant fertiliser even if it does reek like sweaty sports bag) so I see no harm in this.\n\nHaving said that I can see why you don't like it and itvs an acceptable thing to ask him to stop, especially as you do have available bathrooms", "YTA.. let the pee outside. who is hurting?", "YTA / if no one is harmed, it shouldn\u2019t matter", "I find it personally insulting for someone to piss on my house,  shed or my property in general.

Like do you live in a mansion that it takes 5 minutes to get to the bathroom.

They\u2019re grimy and old, but they all look like they\u2019ve been dyed for some reason. \n\nSo I wander over to the plaque next to the church wall and just happen to read that this square was a popular guillotine spot during the Terror and the sanitation at the time was so poor/undertended that the blood from the executions sat in the square under the guillotine, congealing and rotting, until *all the stones nearby had turned pink from the blood*. \n\nParis, in summation, is *historically* filthy, and it\u2019s kind of awesome.", "It is, the smell is just horrible everywhere.", "I\u2019ve been a few times including recently. It was as clean as I would expect for a large city, cleaner than other large cities I\u2019ve been to. No smell and I\u2019ve been in the middle of summer. I personally love Paris. It\u2019s one of my most favorite places.", "Yes", "Urine from pre-pubescent children is said to smell different from adult pee, due to the lack of sex hormones. (This is also part of why the gents and ladies loos have a noticeably different smell -- different sex hormones in the pee.)\n\nEither way though, what he is doing will eventually cause the smell to linger. He should stop.\n\nNTA", "Yes. I think that one of the best thing that individual humans could do to reduce their impact on the planet is to save all their waste paper, shred it or spread it on the ground and piss on it. \n\nYou would turn two big waste streams into one very good source of compost.", "I have found my people!", "Yeah, the thing about lingering piss smell is that it isn\u2019t that bad until it is, and then it REALLY bad. I used to work at a restaurant/bar that was near this sidewalk structure that was very convenient for random people to piss on. It was cleaned every week by the city, and the first few days of piss after cleaning it didn\u2019t smell, but a few days in the smell just all just hit at once, it was awful. Really seemed to permeate the area too, even though it was just stone", "Yup, anyone who passed by a place where homeless people tend to stay knows this. (They tend to pee there all the time and eventually the place starts smelling)", "have you tried hydrating?", "**Neutral**, not natural. The claim was that urine is acidic. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s neutral in the PH scale.", "A child's logic can be fascinating. I can understand a kid doing that, especially if they owned a dog.", "What the heck is an open area bathroom?", "1) name checks out. Specie traitor. But checks out\n\n2) yeah, easy to say that. Essy to joke about mutilating guys. I guess thats the only thing kosher to joke about\n\nPS husbands arent \"pets\". Dare to make any remote reference linking wives to pets and see the shit storm\n\nI guess misandry comes easy huh", "Cool, never heard of it, as mentioned in another comment. And I do know a heap of avid gardeners and composters. \n\nPerhaps it's not ideal in the climate where I live or something.", "Cool! I didn't know about that use, so yes, I didn't mean to dispute you on that specifically.\n\nSurely this must depend on what you put on the compost normally though? A lot of garden waste? Because in my experience people who compost mostly household waste have issues with it being too wet, peeing on that seems like it could exacerbate things...", "Exactly! OP is definitely right to be pissed. Hehe", "It\u2019s not public though", "Do you think it's reasonable someone's life is ruined because some kid sees them peeing on their own property?", "I don\u2019t think people in certain countries have very big yards.", "Yeah, my partner has been \u201dnurturing\u201d our lemon tree when the toilet\u2019s occupied for a while now \ud83d\ude02", "Man, idk wtf the kids are up to these days", "Pissing in a forest when there's no toilet around is quite a bit different than pissing in their own yard behind a shed. That's fucking gross and lazy.", "Or you can flush something like every other wee and clean it every once in a while :)\n\nPersonally I am \\*trying\\* not to flush every time (since about this summer since we've been in a dought) but it is a tough habit to break. Definitely not used to urine smell, I've a rather more sensitive nose than I'd like really.\n\nBut I'm certain there is a middle ground.", "My dick is pretty darn clean and I don't piss on it. The bathroom door on is probably dirtier, especially if the seat is left up when flushing.", "Ye well I saw the post about how frequently women wash their bras so I know y'all aint saints.", "I live in London. I could do a tour of the best spots to smell urine it's not nice. \n\nNTA.", "You can include Seattle too. The alleys all smell like piss or sometimes piss and chemicals they try to spray to cover it\n\nEdited to add: the biggest reason it\u2019s a problem in Seattle is there are very few places you can pee without spending money. At one point they spent a bunch of taxpayer money on these fancy public toilets and quickly had to remove them because prostitutes and drug users were setting up camp in them", "In Italy is human AND dog pee. A mix that I don't recommend.", "You realize Europe is massive right?", "r/woooosh", "Right, so like he said, just the French.", "Yeah, Barcelona in the summer is rough.", "I was disappointed about this. I wonder if they are away from any neighbors or if he thinks this is a blind spot. They may live in rural areas. But if not!", "That\u2019ll account for the smell then.", "Do you have any pics/links of this? I definitely am feeling some morbid curiosity\u2026", "TIL about urine smells due to sex hormones! That\u2019s crazy. Thanks for sharing!", "What's the difference between him doing that and an outside dog doing that?\n\nETA: I'm truly curious. Not trying to use this as a \"slam-dunk pro-outside-peeing\" argument", "There's a program called keep poop in the loop in some country where they just piss and shit in the street and they've solved that problem with composting toilets and have brought alot of dead soil back to life", "Oh, I didn\u2019t catch that! I retract my comment, that\u2019s what I get for Redditing before coffee, lol.", "I\u2019d still find it funny if the wife was peeing in the yard", "I don\u2019t know that a ton of people actually do it. Basically, breaking down plant matter initially uses nitrogen (in the end, compost does have nitrogen, just consumes it at first). so pee can help speed up the process.", "To compost properly you're supposed to do at least 50/50 'green' and 'brown' waste so equal amounts of wet and equal amounts of things like cardboard/paper and certain pet feaces/bedding (off the top of my head I believe it's rabbits, Guinea pigs and similar but anyone reading this should check first, I only have cats and theirs is toxic so I stopped reading safe pet feaces to compost).\n\nIdeal set up is layer of wet, layer of brown, alternating until the compost bin is full finishing with brown layer then male urine on the top and leave alone for 6-18 months depending on climate.", "Do you think that what you, I, or anyone on Reddit thinks is reasonable is high on the list of factors considered by any police officer, public prosecutor, or judge?", "Yea you're right, that pry plays a role. I'm assuming they have quarter acre at very minimum", "If you\u2019re in a drought it almost makes even more sense to pee outside if you can, uses 0 gallons of flushing liquid every pee vs potentially 2 (depending on your toilet model). No matter how many pee\u2019s go in eventually you\u2019ll need to flush it, using those 2 gallons that could have been saved by going outside.\n\nAlso completely don\u2019t understand the \u201cit\u2019s going to smell!\u201d Comments. I\u2019ve know multiple people who pee outside regularly, even one who peed multiple times a day in *the same exact spot*, you could legitimately stand over the spot he peed and not smell anything but fresh grass/woods.", "Your dick has plenty of bacteria on it and other people don't want that on their hands. Women don't even have to touch their privates when they pee and they still wash their hands. Plus, you touch the same button when you flush, which also has bacteria on it.", "Not just Europe - NYC on a hot summer day", "all lifts in tube stations/train stations stink of urine", "Seconding London. The warm weather is not helping.\n\nNTA - it's not hygienic, and that smell will be getting stronger and waft in eventually. Also, your neighbours might investigate if it starts to affect them, like if they can smell it. Your husband is being gross and lazy.", "You realise I live in Europe, right?", "Europe is kinda on the small side compared to the other continents.", "Tbh, I love Barcelona, it\u2019s one of my favourite destinations, but it can get a bit ripe in the summer", "Haha rich people problems. Theres a bunch of bathrooms in the house but its to much work to walk to one to use it? Im lucky if the single bathroom we have is open for me to use when i need to. I wish i just had problems like this.", "First, outside dogs (and other animals) don't normally go marking their territory by peeing in a single spot repeatedly. They scatter it around their entire territory. Their natural behaviour isn't to use a single spot as a toilet, as OP's partner is doing.\n\nSecond, the smell of human pee, and specifically the smell of the sex hormones and pheromones entrenched in human pee (btw, don't google the ingredients of perfumes and after-shaves if you don't have a weak stomach) is something that the human sense of smell is particularly attuned to. We evolved to be more aware of that smell, because it was how we found each other (and in simpler times, how we found each other attractive). So an outside dog peeing in one spot consistently still won't smell as intensely *to humans* as a human doing the same.", "Aha! Fake!\n\nFemale cats dont get spayed!\n\nPs confused hahaa (spayneuterooooga)", "The newspaper here once showed a picture of beautiful, healthy tomato plants filling this guy's front yard.
