I am vegan, my husband isn't, and our toddler is vegetarian/vegan-ish (he doesn't like animal dairy but will ravish eggs). We don't cook meat in the home, although my husband eats it out of the home, and our toddler isn't a fan. Before anyone jumps on my ass he has been introduced to it because his dad eats it. He just prefers fries. (Same, kid).\n\nAnyway, I took my daughter to my parents house about a week ago. My mom is also vegan so we were eating our tofu and rice. My daughter has just started solids so she was also going ham on my plate. My parents dog ate more than I did.\n\nMy younger sister (15) had her friends over. They were having burgers or something and watching me with my daughter. After I ate I nursed her and one asked if I was vegan. I said yes, she got this weird kinda look, and asked if my baby was going to be vegan.\n\nI just kinda shrugged because, you know, she could be a dairy hating fry fiend like her brother or a cheese-aholic like her daddy. Maybe, maybe not. My sisters friend nodded and spoke to me a little more before leaving. \n\nI thought it was a little odd but shrugged it off. Teens are weird creatures sometimes.\n\nAnyway, unbeknownst to me, this teen had decided I was a crazy vegan \"crunchy\" mom. Theres a few tiktokers who are apparently stupid about their kids safety and happen to be breastfeeding vegans. Like yours truly.\n\nI thought all was well - my sister sent me a link on the importance of a balanced diet for kids among a few other bits and eventually I called her. I was like, what the hell? And she started going on about how I was a bad mom.\n\nI told her to watch her mouth and she blew up and said I was the one with a \"crunchy vegan baby\". \n\nSo, turns out, her friends are all convinced my children are terribly abused by my veganism, and because she'd never seen my toddler eat meat it was clearly true. \n\nI told her to calm the fuck down, explained my parenting, yada yada.\n\nShe them got mad because all her friends think I'm a terrible mom and I should have been clearer and not just shrugged her friends question off because I should have known what they would have assumed I meant.\n\nI think she's being dramatic. They were worried, wires got crossed, all is well. She's still acting like its the worst thing in the world.\n\nSo, basically, aita for making a mistake and having my sisters friends think I've got a crunchy vegan baby?\n\nAs a side note, my husband was feeling petty so he went and got ribs for lunch. Filmed little lady eating her first rib. I can now firmly say she will not be a vegan, vegetarian or anything of the sort.

He was always allowed to make whatever choices he wanted to.\n\nBut sure, cause we mostly ate vegan at home, its what he liked and what he was used to.  Also, I dont really drink soda, not my vibe, kiddo was allowed to, but since its not what he grew up around and we never had it in the house, he just never really was into it.\n\nSo...def lots of very judgemental lectures....the dramaaaa when someone found out kiddo had never eaten at mcDonalds when he was 4.

Is that not how a forum works?", "I\u2019m clearly talking about harmful chemicals, like growth hormones, and it doesn\u2019t take a moderately smart person to realize that. You\u2019re picking at tiny words, when it\u2019s obvious what I mean. Even herbivores eat meat when they\u2019re hungry.", "lol I\u2019m clearly talking about man made chemicals that are clearly in everything we consume now. I\u2019ve enjoyed watching the meltdown of like 20 people all getting upset from my one simple comment. Including yourself.

It's generally cheaper and keeps their animals genetics varied.", "Because they have been bred specifically to over produce milk, which is painful if not milked. Naturally, they learn that standing in the parlour for 20mintues stops the pain.   \n\nWe have created breeds that can't exist without human intervention, that's not vegan.\n\nIf humans had not created dairy cattle, they would only need their calf like non-dairy breeds. If humans do not ai the cattle, they would not be producing milk at all.", "Fun fact, one of the factors that contribute to cows kicking off calves to ween them, but not doing that to farmers, is because calves headbutt their moms udders to trigger them to let the milk down for easier nursing. When theyre small this is fine, but as they get bigger and stronger it starts to be uncomfortable and then painful so the moms start kicking them off.\n\nFarmers dont bother them though because they instead just massage the bag to get the milk to let down. Much less uncomfy and annoying", "Do you not know the difference between cattle and calf? Or feral and domestic?\n\nThere are no wild cow breeds left. They are all domestic, human created breeds. Not vegan.\n\nPutting a human created animal in the wild doesn't make it a natural wild animal. That would be a feral, domestic animal. Consuming their fluids is not vegan\n\nHow can a living thing with no awareness give consent to being eaten? Can we eat brain dead humans? No consent, not vegan.\n\nI don't need to allow vegans anything.

It's this an environmental point you're making? If you're referring you emissions then it might surprise you that the shipping and transport emissions are miniscule compared to production emissions.
