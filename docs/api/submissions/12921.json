What she was doing was stupid and inconsiderate. You were more than kind to pick the bag up as much as you did.", "NTA\n\nAnyone calling you an asshole for not respecting them for their 'superior age' is most likely an asshole. Especially if their loose shit is flapping about a plane cabin. It's literally one of the most dangerous things and they tell you not to have loose crap unsecured.\n\nThis woman is a liability AND an asshole.", "NTA.  It is entirely her fault.  She can stop putting the bag there. The bag doesn't belong on the armrest anyway.  She was rude.\n\nIf it were me I would have stopped picking it up and nudged it under her seat. That way it was returned to her with minimal effort on my part and maybe if she actually had to put the effort in to reach down on an airplane,  she might stop being ridiculous.", "NTA- twice, ok but other that she is TA here. You know your bag is going to fall so why not move it somewhere else.", "NTA. She is very inconsiderate.", "NTA. It's not your job to hand her her bag if she doesn't care whether it keeps falling down or not.", "NTA i hate people who think everything should be handed to them and they should just be treated extra well just because they're older. being older isnt an achievement nor should be a get out of jail for free card for AH behaviour  \nJust keep your bag somewhere else its not my bag why would i pick it up over and over?", "NTA. I would\u2019ve left it on the floor after the third time and feigned sleep.", "NTA. She needs to put her bag on the floor where it belongs. Next time just keep the bag for yourself. LOL", "NTA, the woman was very self-centered, rude, entitled, and 30-35 is about three decades too young to pull any \"sympathy because I'm older\" cards.", "NTA. I would probably have kicked it down the aisle by the 3rd time.", "NTA. If this unfortunate event happens again, you can kick that bag while open, under the seat towards her.", "NTA, but should have just kicked the bag underneath the seat because she obviously didn't care that much about it to let it fall so many times.", "NTA - Honestly you were kind and patient, I would have told the flight attendant after the 5th time or before....", "NTA\n\nShe should be thankful that no one's just taking off with her bag. Typically you wanna hold on to stuff like that in public places.", "NTA", "NTA. She paid for her seat, not everything around her and she certainly didn't pay for your continuous retrieval services. I might have accidentally drop kicked that bag if it kept falling on me like that. I guess no one ever told her that your age doesn't command respect, because if it did, everyone would respect the hell out of me. People who think that way are usually awful people, so I admire your restraint with her. Your English is fine, too \ud83d\ude42.", "I would have thanked her loudly and ruffled through the bag for some gum.

Advise her don't feel comfortable handling someone else's luggage / bag\n2. leave it on the floor and let her figure it out on her own.\n3. Kick it under her seat and go back to sleep. \n4. or my personal favorite  tell MS Older Than You then she should know better and is old enough to know how to secure her property without it becoming a nuisance for other passengers.", "Nta\n\nAfter it fell 2 times she was doing it on purpose.", "This is the best way to handle the situation."]}
