After it falls twice, you stop putting the bag there.", "Instead pick it up and ask if there\u2019s somewhere else to put the bag since it\u2019s a hazard. You can ask the flight attendant if she doesn\u2019t find a new solution.", "NTA\n\nOnce is an accident, and understandable, but she should have done her part in making sure that her bag was not a bother to you.

That bag is meant to be stored under the seat in front of her, not on a hand rest. After the second time, I would have either not handed it back, or handed it to the flight attendant.

More than 5 times in less than 3 hours? That\u2019s ridiculous. At that point, it\u2019s not an accident.
