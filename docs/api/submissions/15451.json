I have always had a very alternative look, even as a child, that got more expressive as I grew up. Colorful hair, facial piercings, tattoos, and very dark and bold makeup. This is how I feel most comfortable and happy. \n\nWhen we started dating, my bf said he liked my look, even though he himself dresses very basically. He even hyped me up when I showed him new makeup looks or outfits. However a few days ago as I was getting ready for work, he kept making weird faces at me. I asked him what was up and he said nothing but kept shaking his head. This really irritated me because he was obviously bothered but I wasn\u2019t going to entertain his huffy behavior. I finished getting ready and tried to kiss him goodbye like I always do but he just turned away from me. This really hurt my feelings and I can\u2019t even lie, I did cry a little bit on the way to work. I tried to text him during my breaks but he didn\u2019t respond at all. \n\nWhen I finally got home and he still wouldn\u2019t say anything to me, I lost it. I asked him what his problem was and why he\u2019s treating me this way. He motioned to my clothes and simply said \u201cthat\u201d. I obviously didn\u2019t know what he meant so I asked what about it and he said something like \u201cI just can\u2019t believe you\u2019d wear that to work\u201d I was confused because this is what I always wear. I told him that and he was like \u201cyeah I know, it\u2019s so unprofessional, you\u2019ll never accomplish anything looking like that\u201d I couldnt believe he said that to me. I was fighting back tears at this point, trying to tell him that my job allows it and that I\u2019m not the only one at work that dresses like this. He just kept repeating himself and said that clearly it\u2019s not that good of a job if they allow me to look like that. \n\nI couldnt take it anymore and left to go to my sisters house. He called me and I told him to fuck off, that I wasn\u2019t gonna change my look because he didn\u2019t like it. He called me selfish, saying that I\u2019m ruining our future together because I can\u2019t sacrifice one thing so we could have a good life together. Even though my job allows it AND it\u2019s a good paying office job. There was no reason for me to sacrifice anything. After that, I hung up on him and ignored him the rest of the night. I explained everything to my sister and she does agree my look is unprofessional, but if it doesn\u2019t cause issues at work then it shouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nThe next day, I had about a million messages from him saying how selfish I\u2019m being and ruining our futures. I started feeling really guilty for leaving. I feel like I\u2019m not wrong here but even my sister kind of agreed with him so I don\u2019t know. \n\nTLDR; My boyfriend got upset that I wore my usual alternative style to work saying it\u2019s unprofessional.

If you switch jobs in the future, you can reevaluate what is appropriate, but why would you switch right now if work doesn't care and you enjoy how it looks. This is a future issue that may literally never be an issue. If he won't apologize or back down, you may need to consider if he's worth putting up with this.", "NTA\n\nIt's time for you and your BF to have a sincere conversation about this. People don't usually 180 on liking something (in this case your clothing and cosmetic choices) without something -rightly or wrongly- influencing that change. It would be helpful to know where this shift came from and why.\n\nI'm also not ready to dismiss your boyfriend's concerns (though he's been 100% wrong in addressing them, no contest there!) because you haven't provided much information regarding your field of work. I'm formerly a bartender and what you're describing would have been perfectly fine for that job and while it paid the bills while I was young, it's not a field I wanted to remain in for my career.\n\nMy next job was at a company where, if you like and are good at the work, you have a lot of moving-up opportunities. I started as a temp summer employee and over fifteen years worked my way up to R&D management. I can tell you right now that for advancement within the company, I would not have been able to accomplish that in my bartending gear. Bartending attire is appropriate for bartending but not for climbing the corporate ladder, especially once I was stepping into positions that involve face-to-face interaction with clients or potential clients.\n\nSo, those two paragraphs are basically contingent upon the type of work you do and why I think your BF may be taking issue with how you appear at work. From his perspective, you may be locking yourself into a position that won't allow you much advancement based on how you dress. Or, it may truly not matter, you're the only one who can know that since it's your experience and observations within your workplace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just waving at you, the whole package, dismissively and being like \"this,\" then negging the hell out of you?  And trying to pretend YOU had suddenly changed?

That's where the gaslighting came into the story.

Thats really weird manipulative behaviour hes training you to feel like shit so that you are easy to control, ultimately training you to be in a place where he just gives a hint of his disapproval and youre trained to scramble to put it \u201cright\u201d.

Thats bullshit. \n\nYouve clearly been successful at work, your look is part of the culture there and he is choosing to ignore the reality of the situation and stick to this false narrative that you are putting your job in danger with your outfit. Someone who is not emotionally manipulative would not insist on this narrative that is not the reality of the situation. The fact that he frames this as you not making a sacrifice for you both as a couple and your future is the cherry on this toxic manipulative cake - this has nothing to do with your job and everything to do with seeing how much of yourself you are willing to lose for him.
