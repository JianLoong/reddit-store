I have always had a very alternative look, even as a child, that got more expressive as I grew up. Colorful hair, facial piercings, tattoos, and very dark and bold makeup. This is how I feel most comfortable and happy. \n\nWhen we started dating, my bf said he liked my look, even though he himself dresses very basically. He even hyped me up when I showed him new makeup looks or outfits. However a few days ago as I was getting ready for work, he kept making weird faces at me. I asked him what was up and he said nothing but kept shaking his head. This really irritated me because he was obviously bothered but I wasn\u2019t going to entertain his huffy behavior. I finished getting ready and tried to kiss him goodbye like I always do but he just turned away from me. This really hurt my feelings and I can\u2019t even lie, I did cry a little bit on the way to work. I tried to text him during my breaks but he didn\u2019t respond at all. \n\nWhen I finally got home and he still wouldn\u2019t say anything to me, I lost it. I asked him what his problem was and why he\u2019s treating me this way. He motioned to my clothes and simply said \u201cthat\u201d. I obviously didn\u2019t know what he meant so I asked what about it and he said something like \u201cI just can\u2019t believe you\u2019d wear that to work\u201d I was confused because this is what I always wear. I told him that and he was like \u201cyeah I know, it\u2019s so unprofessional, you\u2019ll never accomplish anything looking like that\u201d I couldnt believe he said that to me. I was fighting back tears at this point, trying to tell him that my job allows it and that I\u2019m not the only one at work that dresses like this. He just kept repeating himself and said that clearly it\u2019s not that good of a job if they allow me to look like that. \n\nI couldnt take it anymore and left to go to my sisters house. He called me and I told him to fuck off, that I wasn\u2019t gonna change my look because he didn\u2019t like it. He called me selfish, saying that I\u2019m ruining our future together because I can\u2019t sacrifice one thing so we could have a good life together. Even though my job allows it AND it\u2019s a good paying office job. There was no reason for me to sacrifice anything. After that, I hung up on him and ignored him the rest of the night. I explained everything to my sister and she does agree my look is unprofessional, but if it doesn\u2019t cause issues at work then it shouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nThe next day, I had about a million messages from him saying how selfish I\u2019m being and ruining our futures. I started feeling really guilty for leaving. I feel like I\u2019m not wrong here but even my sister kind of agreed with him so I don\u2019t know. \n\nTLDR; My boyfriend got upset that I wore my usual alternative style to work saying it\u2019s unprofessional.

If you switch jobs in the future, you can reevaluate what is appropriate, but why would you switch right now if work doesn't care and you enjoy how it looks. This is a future issue that may literally never be an issue. If he won't apologize or back down, you may need to consider if he's worth putting up with this.", "NTA\n\nIt's time for you and your BF to have a sincere conversation about this. People don't usually 180 on liking something (in this case your clothing and cosmetic choices) without something -rightly or wrongly- influencing that change. It would be helpful to know where this shift came from and why.\n\nI'm also not ready to dismiss your boyfriend's concerns (though he's been 100% wrong in addressing them, no contest there!) because you haven't provided much information regarding your field of work. I'm formerly a bartender and what you're describing would have been perfectly fine for that job and while it paid the bills while I was young, it's not a field I wanted to remain in for my career.\n\nMy next job was at a company where, if you like and are good at the work, you have a lot of moving-up opportunities. I started as a temp summer employee and over fifteen years worked my way up to R&D management. I can tell you right now that for advancement within the company, I would not have been able to accomplish that in my bartending gear. Bartending attire is appropriate for bartending but not for climbing the corporate ladder, especially once I was stepping into positions that involve face-to-face interaction with clients or potential clients.\n\nSo, those two paragraphs are basically contingent upon the type of work you do and why I think your BF may be taking issue with how you appear at work. From his perspective, you may be locking yourself into a position that won't allow you much advancement based on how you dress. Or, it may truly not matter, you're the only one who can know that since it's your experience and observations within your workplace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I were actually concerned about this I would sit you down and ask about the office culture, your career aspirations, whether anyone who has similar style has been promoted, etc. \n\nHe either went about this in the completely wrong way or he was up to his old tricks and found out you have more self confidence than he is used to encountering.", "NTA\n\nYou def have to reassess your relationship though. IF you had issues at work and were trying to figure out why and he was trying help you by problem solving, MAYBE that would be different. But work is cool with it- so what\u2019s his issue? Control. That\u2019s what it is. He wants things his narrow visioned way only. \n\nBtw different professions can present differently. Hubby is a financial consultant. He wears expensive suits with a very conservative hair cut. I am a music director. Funky clothes - purple hair- definitely unique style. We are both successful in our careers :)", "NTA. He doesn't get to police what you wear to work. Only work gets a say in that. \n\nThe best place I have worked to date was a research lab where nobody gave a shit what you wore. Sure, they'd clean up and wear suits when they had to, but they were far more concerned with the quality of their work than what they looked like. And some of these researchers were internationally renowned in their field. Your boyfriend needs to either hit the road or broaden his understanding of what makes a quality employee.", "NTA.  Aw he's so precious.  He thought you were \"quirky\" at first.  But now that he's realized it's who you are, he's annoyed because he believes in the Square and you don't fit it.  He doesn't think you can have a good job being you.  He feels you should be willing to put yourself in the Box to fit in and have any sort of future with him.  He's unwilling to see it any other way, so he's lashing out and now trying to guilt you and manipulate you, emotionally.  Be done with him.  You can have all sorts of jobs and dress and present however you want.  I was an attorney and had some colorful pieces of hair, some visible piercings, and small tattoos visible.  I couldn't go all out, but I was allowed a measure of freedom.  And that at a firm in the south.", "Since he stays at YOUR place, I would ask him how come he has no problems with your job when it\u2019s single handedly paying the bills? \n\nHe knows his argument is stupid, or else he wouldn\u2019t move the goal posts around. It just shows how little he truly respects you if he thinks such a stupid argument,that is easily refuted, will get you to change your entire style. \n\nThere are men out there that will truly love your style AND also respect you enough to let you make our own choices regarding your professional life. 8 months is too short to even consider staying with someone showing their true colors like him(in my opinion).", "NTA - you\u2019re worth more than what this dude has to offer. On top of that, Idk if you have any desire for kids later on, but imagine staying in this relationship and he speaks to your daughter that way. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to figure out where this suddenly came from - Did you recently meet a new member of his family or friend of his? Someone who has a lot of influence over him? Sounds like someone made him feel some kind of way and now he\u2019s lashing out. If he\u2019s that easily influenced to flip on something like that, I\u2019d be gone.", "NTA but your boyfriend is a controlling AH for sure. \n\nHis arguments don\u2019t even make sense. You are not doing some part time minimum wage job you barely got. \nAnd him saying you job can\u2019t be that good if they allow you to wear \u201cunprofessional\u201d clothes is stupid. It\u2019s actually the opposite! A good employer will not micromanage employees and their looks. \n\nAlso please please do not ignore how this all came out. He encouraged you and even hyped you up only to then come after your looks! Classic narcissist behaviour. \n\nTalking about you not making sacrifices \u201cfor your future\u201d is crappy too. What exactly is he talking about? Saving for a wedding? A house deposit? At this point I\u2019d reevaluate this entire relationship and be very vigilant about his next moves.", "Calling you selfish because you won't do what he wants is a red flag.  RUN", "RUN", "NTA\n\nHe probably figured it was a phase and that if enough time passed, he\u2019d be able to chip away at your self esteem to become what he wanted. Drop the AH like a hot potato and rock your look!", "NTA. Look up Gothic librarian. Many people have alternative fashion looks and are highly successful. I have several degrees, many tattoos, colored hair (not the norm). My job deals with the public, I'm paid well. My Husband is more reserved. No tattoos, wears button downs and has no problem with who I am. Don't lower your standards and don't change a part of yourself that makes you happy.", "For real, sounds like she\u2019s dodging a bullet on this one. He probably thought it was a \u201cphase\u201d or a \u201chobby\u201d and he could change her eventually.\n\nNTA and move right along. My favorite phrase - when people show you who they are, *believe them*.", "It won't just be one thing either. Give on this and he'll find \nother things he wants to change.\n\nThis is classic territory - I love you, you're perfect, now change. \n\nOP, if you're going to change, change your BF.", "I think that\u2019s his plan. He wants to break up with her but doesn\u2019t have the balls.  It sounds like the relationship version of \u201csuicide by cop\u201d.", "Exactly. He didn\u2019t have an issue with how you dressed when you started dating so why does he now? And if work doesn\u2019t have an issue with it and it\u2019s a good job, keep at it. Don\u2019t ever change yourself for anyone. Whoever you\u2019re with should love you as you are.", "Dude... her work is OK with it, so there's literally no reason for her to sacrifice anything at all. It sounds like he's done a 180\u00b0, and this may be him trying to start bending her to accommodate him. He'll start with her clothes, then her piercings, then her hobbies, friends, family, career, etc. It sounds like he's trying to get the ball rolling to make OP submit to him.", "Old lady with green hair and a professional management-type job making good money here chiming in. HUGE red flag, dump his ass and keep on being your awesome self.", "This - he has changed what he said he likes about you.  If he doesn\u2019t like it he can leave.  Do not change for him or it will not stop and the goalpost will keep changing.  NTA", "The friends you see, because of you love him you should stop seeing them...", "Exactly my question! Seems like something happened he isn\u2019t talking about. I was also wondering if it wasn\u2019t directly related to her but maybe someone made a comment about a coworker or person they saw with similar style.", "My instant thought was \u201cwho is in his ear whispering this poison?\u201d \n\nFor eight months he \u201cloves her look\u201d and now suddenly her looks are \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cruining their future\u201d?", "NTA and this was my thought also. I\u2019m thinking someone from his office made a comment that embarrassed him & he\u2019s taking it out on you. It\u2019s about his insecurities. Time to say bubye", "Oh it\u2019s YOUR place and you left for the night. You should have kicked his ass out hun. This is not an okay way to treat you at all. No goodbye, giving you the silent treatment, just no communication until you force it out of him as you\u2019re clearly upset.\n\nHe is not a good man, be thankful he is showing you this now and dump his ass. You deserve so much better and you don\u2019t need to change for anyone as long as you\u2019re happy in yourself.", "Box up his stuff and get your keys back. Stay right the way away from this dude.", "I think you may have been a \u201cfrog in the pot\u201d. He had you in there and was turning up the heat. Instead of staying in the pot, like a good little frog, you jumped out and escaped. Good for you! Don\u2019t let abusers back into your life.", "I work in insurance, too. I also have visible tattoos and although my hair is currently my natural color, I\u2019ve had magenta and lavender hair before. NBD. \n\nYour boyfriend sounds controlling and is displaying some narcissistic behavior. This sudden switch between acceptance and rejection of your look is a way to make you question yourself. You\u2019re being selfish all of a sudden because you\u2019re dressing the same way you always have? Mmk. \n\nNTA, but you need to reassess your relationship. It seems like it\u2019s going into toxic territory.", "So you\u2019ve had the job longer than the boyfriend and he thinks he can tell you what is best for you and your work? \n\nNope. NOPE.", "> he went back to his moms\n\nHoly shit! Do NOT take life advice from a failed to launch Mama's boy with all the style of day old bread.\n\nFucking hell, lady, update your self esteem! You sound fabulous and FUNCTIONAL. Don't sacrifice any of that for this guy.", "Just consider yourself lucky he is ignoring you and move on. He sounds like he badly wants to control you. Please don\u2019t let this happen. You sound like a successful woman who is happy with herself. He sounds like he can\u2019t handle that. A future with him will destroy who you are. NTA.", "This not not a good guy. Do you want to waste another day hoping he'll suddenly be a good guy? \n\nHow does hoping a cruel, controlling man will change usually go for women?", "A few people are going down the controlling or emotionally abusive route, his behaviour is a bit of a red flag but it's quite possible he could just be projecting onto you. \n\nIn the mid twenties a lot of people start stressing about their career and their forever job, it's sounds like he's not having a good time at work, or maybe been passed over for a promotion and is hyper fixating on work, success and a future together. He could also be down the grindset social media wormhole, or worse a Tate bro. \n\nThat said his concerns are pretty ridiculous, even if the style was affecting your chances of promotion, which is hasn't, congrats on the quick progression, you're already pretty far ahead of the pack being in a good role at 24, there's no reason to be wanting to pole vault up the career ladder at that age unless you desperately want that. \n\nThis is all a him problem and I think he's using your style as an excuse to not introspect properly and admit what his real problem is with his own career or personal life.", "So I just commented as to the why if you leaving. But this piece of work ran you out of your own damn home???? You let him!?? And he had the audacity to act as though he is the wronged party???? Ffs OP. Please look at this form an outsiders perspective. He\u2019s not a good guy. There are so many fish in the sea and you hooked a mutant toadfish. Throw him back and learn to have some boundaries. You don\u2019t run from your own home when a short term partner starts showing themselves to be jerks. You tell them to leave and to reach out when they are ready to apologize.", "I tried to, but he responded exactly the same. I\u2019m hoping to have a better discussion with him soon. Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to get through to him.", "I disagree. Why do you say they're an asshole? They're dressing how they feel comfortable AND its allowed where they work.\n\n YOU need to grow up lol", "This was pretty much my sisters point. However as I stated in the post, my actual job does not care. There are other people who dress in a similar way.

Yeah, time to set him free and find someone who appreciates you for who you are and doesn't treat your personal style as some novelty.  Then he will be free to find the insecure Barbie princess he is looking for.", "Eyup!", "Yup. I'm another old woman and I firmly firmly firmly agree with these other two old women.  This is who he is. It will not get better. He is showing you what your future will be if you stay with him. \n\nDon't. Get out. Find someone better. Be unashamedly yourself.", "Yep. Older lady that dresses so prim and proper most people probably think she\u2019s a church going Republican chiming in here. Massive red flag. He\u2019s controlling and the calculating, manipulative, passive-aggressive way he used to try to tear her down is something to run away from as fast as she can. He scripted a little theater production designed to make her feel bad. He planned that. He wanted her to be insecure and to wonder for hours what she had done to upset him. He is fundamentally dishonest and feels entitled to control her. He does not see her as an equal human being.  \n\nNot that it matters, but there are plenty of jobs and industries that really don\u2019t care about your hair color, piercings, or tattoos as long as you\u2019re clothed, hygienic, and not offensive. His \u201cadvice\u201d was clearly more about control, but it\u2019s also pretty outdated.", "Wow! Law is still one of the most conservative professions. Some of my fellow lawyers have relatively conservative tats and some are wearing nice dresses or nice blouses with dress pants or skirts instead of full skirt suits (and yes, there was a time when a suit with skirt was the only thing a female lawyer could wear to court). But I hadn't seen any judges going that far from traditional business looks yet!
