I have always had a very alternative look, even as a child, that got more expressive as I grew up. Colorful hair, facial piercings, tattoos, and very dark and bold makeup. This is how I feel most comfortable and happy. \n\nWhen we started dating, my bf said he liked my look, even though he himself dresses very basically. He even hyped me up when I showed him new makeup looks or outfits. However a few days ago as I was getting ready for work, he kept making weird faces at me. I asked him what was up and he said nothing but kept shaking his head. This really irritated me because he was obviously bothered but I wasn\u2019t going to entertain his huffy behavior. I finished getting ready and tried to kiss him goodbye like I always do but he just turned away from me. This really hurt my feelings and I can\u2019t even lie, I did cry a little bit on the way to work. I tried to text him during my breaks but he didn\u2019t respond at all. \n\nWhen I finally got home and he still wouldn\u2019t say anything to me, I lost it. I asked him what his problem was and why he\u2019s treating me this way. He motioned to my clothes and simply said \u201cthat\u201d. I obviously didn\u2019t know what he meant so I asked what about it and he said something like \u201cI just can\u2019t believe you\u2019d wear that to work\u201d I was confused because this is what I always wear. I told him that and he was like \u201cyeah I know, it\u2019s so unprofessional, you\u2019ll never accomplish anything looking like that\u201d I couldnt believe he said that to me. I was fighting back tears at this point, trying to tell him that my job allows it and that I\u2019m not the only one at work that dresses like this. He just kept repeating himself and said that clearly it\u2019s not that good of a job if they allow me to look like that. \n\nI couldnt take it anymore and left to go to my sisters house. He called me and I told him to fuck off, that I wasn\u2019t gonna change my look because he didn\u2019t like it. He called me selfish, saying that I\u2019m ruining our future together because I can\u2019t sacrifice one thing so we could have a good life together. Even though my job allows it AND it\u2019s a good paying office job. There was no reason for me to sacrifice anything. After that, I hung up on him and ignored him the rest of the night. I explained everything to my sister and she does agree my look is unprofessional, but if it doesn\u2019t cause issues at work then it shouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nThe next day, I had about a million messages from him saying how selfish I\u2019m being and ruining our futures. I started feeling really guilty for leaving. I feel like I\u2019m not wrong here but even my sister kind of agreed with him so I don\u2019t know. \n\nTLDR; My boyfriend got upset that I wore my usual alternative style to work saying it\u2019s unprofessional.

If you switch jobs in the future, you can reevaluate what is appropriate, but why would you switch right now if work doesn't care and you enjoy how it looks. This is a future issue that may literally never be an issue. If he won't apologize or back down, you may need to consider if he's worth putting up with this.", "NTA\n\nIt's time for you and your BF to have a sincere conversation about this. People don't usually 180 on liking something (in this case your clothing and cosmetic choices) without something -rightly or wrongly- influencing that change. It would be helpful to know where this shift came from and why.\n\nI'm also not ready to dismiss your boyfriend's concerns (though he's been 100% wrong in addressing them, no contest there!) because you haven't provided much information regarding your field of work. I'm formerly a bartender and what you're describing would have been perfectly fine for that job and while it paid the bills while I was young, it's not a field I wanted to remain in for my career.\n\nMy next job was at a company where, if you like and are good at the work, you have a lot of moving-up opportunities. I started as a temp summer employee and over fifteen years worked my way up to R&D management. I can tell you right now that for advancement within the company, I would not have been able to accomplish that in my bartending gear. Bartending attire is appropriate for bartending but not for climbing the corporate ladder, especially once I was stepping into positions that involve face-to-face interaction with clients or potential clients.\n\nSo, those two paragraphs are basically contingent upon the type of work you do and why I think your BF may be taking issue with how you appear at work. From his perspective, you may be locking yourself into a position that won't allow you much advancement based on how you dress. Or, it may truly not matter, you're the only one who can know that since it's your experience and observations within your workplace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You guys haven\u2019t been together long enough for him to be trying to change you for \u201cyour future.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m betting someone important to him sat him down and told him they don\u2019t like your style. If this is coming out of nowhere, he\u2019s being influenced. Consider yourself lucky that you found out now. Go be yourself with someone who deserves you, not someone who wants you to hide who you are.", "NTA. I have bright pink in my hair, a nostril ring and a full sleeve of tattoos on my right arm. Never had a problem at work. \n\nI'm a doctor in the UK. \n\nWhat I'm saying here is that you should do you. Do and be what makes you happy. If he isn't making you happy (and he clearly isnt)? Bin him. \n\nI'm sure he'll go on to make someone else's life perfectly miserable, and it won't be yours.", "Hon, you deserve someone who recognizes your style is AMAZING and is happy you have a workplace that is A-OK with it, and who builds you up and is looking forward to the next 50 years of you being you.  Dump this dude and start the rest of your life without someone who tears you down.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou need a better boyfriend.", "NTA. \n\nI Work in a office environment as well, I\u2019ve got piercings in my nose, my ears have loads of piercings and I frequently go into work in joggers and hoodie. I even went in dressed as cat woman as I had a party immediately after work once. \n\nOther people in my office comes in their pyjamas and onesies etc. last week I saw someone walking into the building wearing Spider-Man pyjamas while eating a bowl of coco pops. if your work doesn\u2019t care about what you wear, wear what you want. \n\n\n\nAlso lose the boyfriend, you don\u2019t need that kind of negativity in your life.", "I'm not a typical 'dump him!' redditor but dump him.\nHe is controlling and manipulative and you are putting your mental health at risk by staying with him.\n\nNTA, he is, he's bad news.\nYou do you.", "You\u2019ve been together for 8 months, why is this just now a problem?! Also his treatment of you, acting weird and refusing to talk and intentionally throwing you off all day before telling you what he was upsetting about is textbook emotionally manipulative behavior. Did you recently move in together? A lot of men wait until they have you trapped by a lease or money or a baby to show their true colors and start the emotional abuse. There\u2019s actually been research done on this and in anonymous surveys many men admitted to waiting 6-18 months before they started abusing a partner. He is beginning the process of making you doubt yourself and exercising control over your appearance. It won\u2019t stop here. Run. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI think's trying to tame you.  While some girls like to date bad boys because they think their \"pure, true love\" will bring out the prince inside, some guys like to date strong women in order to vanquish them.", "NTA\n\nSo this AH spends all this time building you up and earning your trust only to turn it around and try and control how you look? No. Classic AH move.  He doesn't love you for who you are, he loves you for who he thinks he can make you be.\n\nYou can do better.  Dump him and move on.", "If your boss doesn't care, it's not on him to police what you wear to work, but it is an issue if he all of a sudden thinks you should change. NTA", "WTF NTA. Here i am,  with my 7 facial piercings,  60% covered in black and gray tattoos and colored hair,  living in a 3 bed 2 bath house in Southern California.  How i look had nothing to do with how well I can do my job and progress.  Get away from this guy. You'll find one who loves all of you,  he's not it and your sister is so wrong. My kids (teenage boys) love having the\"cool mom\" and I could give not a single fuck about anyone who's gonna judge me based on how I feel best about myself.", "NTA. You\u2019ve said several times that your job is fine with it. The fact that he keeps saying it\u2019s about \u201cour future\u201d is what makes it feel like a red flag to me. He\u2019s trying to control you, starting with what you wear", "NTA. It sounds like you are not violating dress code at your work, just his sense of propriety. Therefore it\u2019s none of his business.\n\nI think if you change how you dress to fit his idea of appropriate attire he will start trying to police how you dress for other occasions.", "NTA and please please please do not tamp down who you are for him. I wore the mask of professionalism for a long time and it\u2019s exhausting all of my tattoos are concealable and I didnt dye my hair the rainbow of colors I wanted just to maintain an appearance that nobody else cared about. If you\u2019re happy at your job and they allow it then that\u2019s all that matters", "NTA. If he is this focused on a belief of appearance dictating success then by his own standards he has failed miserably on choosing his ideal partner.", "NTA. Kinda seems like he wants you to dump him.", "I'm quite conservative and dress myself and my daughters the same, stylish but modest.  I've never complained about the looks of anyone else, it's their body/clothes and none of my business.  The hospital system I worked for had very strict rules on appearance, no facial tattoos or gaudy jewelry or facial piercings, even hand tattoos were discouraged though it wouldn't keep you from being hired.  I guess I just sort of followed the appearance guidelines.  I would say if your employer has no issue with it, then your bf needs to chill.  If someone else wants to tat out who am I to judge?  You are definitely NTAH.", "How is it unprofessional if your job allows it? Why is he trying to control the way you dress?\n\nYou've only known each other 8 months, you might not have a future together. Why  is he asking you to change who you are?", "DO NOT CHANGE YOURSELF FOR A MAN!!!!!", "THIS.  This is the best solution.", "No, no, don't do this. \n\nLucifer has enough assholes to deal with.", "This is the way", "This \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb", "Classic gaslighting.", "Yup. This older lady agreed. First he tried to frame it as \"unprofessional\" and her as \"not being willing to sacrifice \\[professionally\\] for their future.\" But as soon as she pointed out that it wasn't actually a problem for her employers and wouldn't impact her professionally, he moved the goalposts and suddenly the problem was that, \"Well then it's obviously not a very good job.\" \n\nHe doesn't care about their future, or her employment prospects. He cares about controlling how she looks, and will continue changing the argument until he hits on one that shames her into complying. This is Abuse 101, and OP needs to get out of that relationship fast.\n\nFrankly, I don't think it's coincidental that she's living with him when they've only been dating for 8 months. She moved in before she really knew him, and now that she's stuck sharing a home with him, he's showing his proverbial ass.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about their future so much as he is an abuser and is trying to see how much he can get away with.", "Without this emotionally abusive man. Nta", "Yep.  I work with a judge with blue hair.", "Yes, this. My brother's a programmer and my dad was kind of a dick about his office attire at first as it was more casual than dad thought was appropriate. Dad's a pretty dense/downright thoughtless guy but at least he was born in the 50s and genuinely means well. I'm not sure this guy does.", "But but but\u2026 that\u2019s what women *do*, isn\u2019t it? They give up their identity for a man, they even give up their *name*, how is cutting back a little bit on the eyeliner such a big *deal*??? Isn\u2019t he *worth* it? \n\nI roll my eyes with sarcasm.", ">Did someone say something to your bf about your style?\n\nI think this is the case, which means bf has no backbone and doesn't even back up his girlfriend.", "Yes i was wondering that too! Either his family or maybe his friends or co work saw her and expressed their opinions. It may have made him feel embarrassed or like they wont like him if she dresses that way. It's definitely not right because if that was what happened he should have stood up to her instead of treating her that way. But it would explain the sudden switch because it makes no sense why he would suddenly have a problem with it.", "But surely you can see how this reflects poorly on him?  How embarrassing to take your woman to a work do when she dresses like (check notes) a strong, confident, partner, like OP.  For those in the cheap seats, sarcasm.  NTA.", "Googling dill hole... yup can agree. OP NTA.", "Yes! DTMFA!", "Honestly, even if she is wearing BDSM gear or looking like a hot mess to work, that's between her and her boss. The bf's opinion is irrelevant", "NTA. Thank heavens you are not dependant on him for housing.  Do not contact him and change your locks.\n\nIf he cannot control you he will walk away, or escalate his bullying.  Brace your heart, process your grief.  He is trying to dump you or dominate you.", "*rolls eyes and puts the dagger back*", "You got to at least look decent when you're at work. \n\nBesides, we don't want her to have people calling her mommy or mistress.", "Hand the dagger over."]}
