We are committed to each other, but we do not plan to get married (we both do not believe in marriage).\n\nWe are both high earners (6 figures each), but he is not good when it comes to finances.\n\nWhen we started getting serious -about 5 years ago- it became apparent. After discussing finances he asked me to take charge of his too.\n\nHe was in debt (consumer) with nothing to show for it but a sports car and a lot of *toys*. He had been paying only minimums on everything including his student loans, so he ended up owing more than what he did when he graduated.\n\nWhat I did was set up automatic transfers: one for a shared account to take care of household expenses (which we shared 50/50), one for a long term savings account (for a house), one for short term savings account (for things like vacations and Christmas gifts) and one linked to a debit card for other things/personal spending.\n\nFast forward to a year ago, he had almost completely wiped his consumer debt, took care of a big chunk of his student loans and was still able to get things he wanted. Then he went on a week-long vacation with his brothers, came back accusing me of taking advantage of him and stealing his money. He insisted I \"give him back control of his finances\" which I did.\n\nI broke up with him, but he got back to his senses I guess, did a lot to get me back and I did. But I promised myself that I would never even offer advice when it comes to his finances.\n\nNow he is asking me to take charge again, apparently he is back in debt (surprise surprise, apparently he spent a lot on his brothers and now his credit card debt is soaring) and money isn't lasting him as much as it did when I was in charge.\n\nI told him that there is no way in hell that I would do that, that I will not put myself in that position again. And here's where I might have taken it into AH territory, I told him \"maybe you should have your brothers help you with that, God knows they are more *knowledgeable* than me, and they would *never* steal from you like I did\".\n\nWell he called me petty, and said that I would prefer to hold on to a grudge than to see him financially secure.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668009487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqmxax/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_bf_with_his_finances/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was in a good financial space thanks to you and when his brothers found out how that occurred, they mocked him. They also wanted him to spend money on him he didn't have. \n\nYou shouldn't need to help him redo the things that he reversed after he \"took charge\" of his finances again. He's a grown man making 6 figures. He can look at past statements and figure it out.", "You\u2019re his partner not his parent.\n\nHe\u2019s making six figures and still can\u2019t manage his finances then he needs to take some personal growth lessons on money habits; there\u2019s literally an industry based around self growth like that and no shortage of material covering finances.\n\nHe\u2019s 35 and obviously competent enough to fix his habits if he actually wants it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You're not holding a grudge. You don't want to be put in a position again where you're taken advantage of and then accused of stealing. Completely different thing.", "NTA - But why are you still in a relationship with this child?", "NTA\n\nThis is more than holding a grudge! You\u2019re protecting yourself from being accused of stealing again. Don\u2019t put yourself in that position. His finances are now his responsibility. If he needs help, maybe he should employ an accountant. You\u2019re not his personal accountant.", "NTA, but why would you reunite with someone who accused you of stealing from him?", "NTA, he is old enough to take care od hiss mess on his own.", "NTA - this is a situation entirely of his own making, and all he has to do is what you laid out already for him. \n\nThe fact he couldn\u2019t take some well deserved sarcastic criticism means he really hasn\u2019t accepted the depth of the betrayal his accusations represented.", "Nta for not taking that responsibility again after he accused you of stealing and taking advantage of him. You are the asshole to yourself for getting back with someone that accused you of stealing from him and taking advantage of him for simply doing as he requested. Respect yourself more, you deserve someone that doesn't throw false accusations around so easily and isn't so easily swayed.", "You're not required to help another adult with their finances if you don't want to.\n\nThere are many \"learn to make a budget\" resources available for free on the Internet.  There are also financial counselors and such available.\n\nIt doesn't seem like you plan to, but obviously do not merge your finances.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nRun girl. If he wants to destroy his life again then that is his choice. Don\u2019t be his mom.", "NTA.

You sure you want to be with a guy who talks to you like this?", "That's why it doesn't work to take back someone who betrayed you. NTA, and I would break up again, because your history sets you at odds with each other. Financial responsibility is a HUGE part of being an adult. He can't manage it, and he turns on you when you do. You can like him, but this is not a sustainable partnership, where you don't lift each other up.", "NTA\n\nI take care of my family's finances as my spouse is also horrible with money. But they appreciate it and would never accuse me of stealing. They believe I'm cheap (which I am) and may get frustrated that I don't support a large unnecessary purchase in favor of saving towards our goals, but they are an adult and have full access to make whatever purchase they decide. \n\nHe decided to make it clear he doesn't want your help and put himself in a horrible spot. Maybe offer to review everything and make suggestions but hold firm on controllong or being on charge of anything.", "Part of doing a lot (to get back and to better oneself) is admitting to mistakes at the base level. It seems that he's still uncomfortable and in denial about that part. Oh-oh.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  If he's going to make baseless accusations, I wouldn't want to help him with his finances either.  But I am curious as to why he would accuse you of taking advantage of him and stealing his money upon his return from the vacation.  It seems like it was out of the blue or there is something missing from the story.", "NTA\n\nhe accused you of theft, essentially, based on what? something his brothers said? Then, later, finds himself in the bed he created, and is mad at you for telling him not? you are not holding a grudge.", "Oh wow you are not responsible for his \"financial security\".  NTA", "NTA and I can't blame you one bit. He and his brothers insulted you when the only thing you did was help him out. Did they apologize? I'm guessing not - so why would they expect you to just forget about it?  Worse, why would your bf expect you to forget about it.\n\nYou're taking the right approach, you've already given him the tools to do this himself, I would never get back into that position with him. \n\nIf he still thinks of you as petty, you should maybe think of yourself as single.", "NTA. You were laying down some truths even if a little snarky it was well deserved. He has a lot of nerve asking you to help with his finances again.", "Slight YTA for getting back with him, staying with him and still being slightly bitter about what happened.

Maybe what he needs is a few visits with a credit counselor to learn how to manage his money. \n\nIt was great how you arranged automatic transfers, but he didn't learn  anything.\n\n#1  get rid if the credit card or have a very low credit limit.\n\nSmart of you to keep everything separate.", "Info: What was the basis of his accusations? Did he think he was missing money, or did his brothers convince him you were fiddling with his finances and pocketing it?", "NTA but this seems like a situation where your cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nIf this is actually a person who you plan on building a future with, owning a home, having kids, etc then wouldn't you want the pair of you to be in the best financial state the two of you could be in? \n\nAlso you said you don't want to get married but you should check local and state/province laws, many places still have common law marriage so you could end up with a chunk of debt regardless of how you try to keep your finances seperate.", "NTA. You tried to help him and that didn\u2019t turn out well. Why would you sign up for Round 2? He made his bed hard, now he can lay in it. There\u2019s tons and tons of resources on personal finance. He can figure it out for himself. Though from what you\u2019ve said in the comments, it sounds like his brothers are part of the issue. It may be hard for him to realize that.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s a major accusation and you are right to never put yourself in that position again", "NTA, but you two should talk that out if you're going to keep it going. You both know whatever happened that week was the catalyst and he got taken. He needs to admit that to himself and accept that he messed up.", "NTA. He needs to grow the hell up.", "NTA. Sounds like a loser", "Op.. if you are truly partners, then help him out. Show him what you did, watch him as he does it, once a month have a financial session where you go over bills and budget. Teach him to fish.   \n\n\nmy husband was similar and now he manages the budget. He loves sneaking a look at his investments and watching the money grow. Took a few years. Still not his favorite thing to do but I\u2019ve no complaints.  (I do the investments but we discuss everything. ). \n\nit is in your best interest that he is financially secure. You\u2019ll end up bailing him out in the future if you love him or breaking up. Why waste the intervening time?  \n\nyta-soft. Because you are just reacting, not thinking long term.", "NTA. He was on a man trip with super smart macho guys who are great with finances. He told them that you got him out of debt with savings and they could not handle or understand financial competency from a female. They convinced him you did woman witcgcraft stuff to steal from him. He did not say: no, guys, it's been great, I was my decision. No, he sided with them and believed them. Tons of disrespect to you. \n\nYou're not holdong a grudge. You are not allowing hisotry to repeat itself. The only way I would take the finances back on is if he apologized to you in front of them all. But again, you may be making him do it because you are woman witch.", "NTA, why are you with this clown again? His d cant be worth it", "ESH.  He is being immature and you are Way more into your grudge & being petty then you are into being true partners.  If you need a perfect partner, look elsewhere.  There are much better ways to effectively communicate that you are not comfortable mixing finances/helping with his finances anymore.", "You sound like you are holding onto a grudge. Soft YTA here, it was definitely petty to say that. A simple no followed by the explanation that you have no desire to have that happen again and the easiest way to do that is to not manage his finances would've sufficed. You can't keep punishing him for something you presumably forgave him for (eg. You took him back). It's bad for the relationship, it's bad for you and it's bad for him. Advise him to hire a financial planner if he needs help that badly.", "Yup. Instead he just wants her to do the enormous, emotionally charged lift of getting him financially secured again after he literally fucked it all up multiple times. I honestly don't know how OP is in a relationship with this immature asshole. Not being in control of finances when you don't make a lot is one thing, but 6 figures and a failure to be in control speaks to a much, much bigger issue.", "Plus the next trip he has with his brothers will just put them back to square one. This man is better off with his brothers and the OP should find herself someone mature to date.", "It's because of his brothers. Before O started budgeting for him they would take advantage of him. For example they would go out shopping and ask him to put something in his card and promise to pay him back later. They wouldn't and he would forget. Or he would end up paying for all of their vacations, trips, drinks at a bar, sports tickets...etc.\n\nI put a stop to most of that (would follow up on owed money, tell him stuff is not in the budget...etc)", "Our finances are completely separate, I own the house we live in and have a tenancy contract with him, he owns his own home that he chose to rent very cheap to one of his brothers.", "Before I was taking care of his finances, his hrothers would take advantage of him. They spent that whole week convincing him that I must be doing something shady, because before I was put in charge he was able to travel a lot, change cars every year and be as extravagant as he wants, but when I was put in charge he was living *a middle class life*", "But why would OP get herself back in that position again where he could accuse her again? She can love him and not want to manage his finance.", "Ok, got it.  Well if he has a job earning 6 figures, I would imagine he is a pretty smart person, even if he isn't terribly fiscally responsible.  What I'm getting at is, how can he not see that his brothers are/were the ones taking advantage of him.  He was with you for years with no issues and much smaller/no debt, and one vacation with his brothers and all of a sudden he accuses you of taking advantage of him.  I think he needs to open his eyes to what his brothers have done to him.  I get he loves them and perhaps has blinders on because he doesn't want to see the obvious, but he he really needs to look harder.", "Very smart.\n\nHe\u2019s way luckier than he thinks he is to have a partner with such a good head on her shoulders.\n\nMy stepmom is a lot like you in many respects and while my father and I have our issues it\u2019s undeniable what a profoundly positive impact she had on him insofar as getting his shit together.\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be challenges getting through this but you seem more than equipped to handle it.", "So you helped him have a budget to live to his means, but he wanted to live a champagne lifestyle on a lemonades wage \ud83d\ude02 \n\nHonestly, I would rethink the relationship again. He doesn\u2019t get to throw his toys out the pram, accuse you of STEALING and then when he manages to get you back, get all arsey because you won\u2019t help him with his finances again. He\u2019s a grown man, he needs to learn to do it. There\u2019s workshops and everything that banks do to help people. \n\nI will hold my hands up and admit I was awful with money before I met my boyfriend. I would just spend and live pay check to pay check. I was never taught properly. He didn\u2019t fully take control of my finances, but he helped me cut back on my spending (I had a genuine shopping addiction linked to my depression) and how to save and all sorts of helpful stuff. You know what I did? I thanked him and was grateful. \n\nNow we\u2019re saving for our own place and I\u2019m in a better place financially and I\u2019m eternally grateful for him helping me. I wouldn\u2019t dream of treating him how you\u2019ve been treated. You helped him so much and he threw it in your face. That is not what a good partner does.", "And what kind of life do the brothers have? I\u2019m curious\u2026 NTA", "I never said that she should get herself back into that position...", "You are preaching to the choir here. I came to the conclusion -years ago- that if I wanted this relationship to last, I should keep away from the topic of his brothers and his relationship with them.", "When I wasn't in charge? The high life\nWhen I was in charge? The life their income afforded them", "Sorry this was supposed to go to the comment before yours :(", "Yea, I would imagine if they are close, that type of conversation could get ugly.  I wish you luck!", "He needs to go to financial therapy."]}
