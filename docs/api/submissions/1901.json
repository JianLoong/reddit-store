Then he went on a week-long vacation with his brothers, came back accusing me of taking advantage of him and stealing his money. He insisted I \"give him back control of his finances\" which I did.\n\nI broke up with him, but he got back to his senses I guess, did a lot to get me back and I did. But I promised myself that I would never even offer advice when it comes to his finances.\n\nNow he is asking me to take charge again, apparently he is back in debt (surprise surprise, apparently he spent a lot on his brothers and now his credit card debt is soaring) and money isn't lasting him as much as it did when I was in charge.\n\nI told him that there is no way in hell that I would do that, that I will not put myself in that position again. And here's where I might have taken it into AH territory, I told him \"maybe you should have your brothers help you with that, God knows they are more *knowledgeable* than me, and they would *never* steal from you like I did\".\n\nWell he called me petty, and said that I would prefer to hold on to a grudge than to see him financially secure.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668009487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqmxax/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_bf_with_his_finances/", "score": 1280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is being immature and you are Way more into your grudge & being petty then you are into being true partners.  If you need a perfect partner, look elsewhere.

Soft YTA here, it was definitely petty to say that. A simple no followed by the explanation that you have no desire to have that happen again and the easiest way to do that is to not manage his finances would've sufficed. You can't keep punishing him for something you presumably forgave him for (eg. You took him back). It's bad for the relationship, it's bad for you and it's bad for him. Advise him to hire a financial planner if he needs help that badly.", "Yup. Instead he just wants her to do the enormous, emotionally charged lift of getting him financially secured again after he literally fucked it all up multiple times. I honestly don't know how OP is in a relationship with this immature asshole. Not being in control of finances when you don't make a lot is one thing, but 6 figures and a failure to be in control speaks to a much, much bigger issue.", "Plus the next trip he has with his brothers will just put them back to square one. This man is better off with his brothers and the OP should find herself someone mature to date.", "It's because of his brothers. Before O started budgeting for him they would take advantage of him. For example they would go out shopping and ask him to put something in his card and promise to pay him back later. They wouldn't and he would forget.

She can love him and not want to manage his finance.", "Ok, got it.  Well if he has a job earning 6 figures, I would imagine he is a pretty smart person, even if he isn't terribly fiscally responsible.  What I'm getting at is, how can he not see that his brothers are/were the ones taking advantage of him.  He was with you for years with no issues and much smaller/no debt, and one vacation with his brothers and all of a sudden he accuses you of taking advantage of him.  I think he needs to open his eyes to what his brothers have done to him.  I get he loves them and perhaps has blinders on because he doesn't want to see the obvious, but he he really needs to look harder.", "Very smart.\n\nHe\u2019s way luckier than he thinks he is to have a partner with such a good head on her shoulders.\n\nMy stepmom is a lot like you in many respects and while my father and I have our issues it\u2019s undeniable what a profoundly positive impact she had on him insofar as getting his shit together.\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be challenges getting through this but you seem more than equipped to handle it.", "So you helped him have a budget to live to his means, but he wanted to live a champagne lifestyle on a lemonades wage \ud83d\ude02 \n\nHonestly, I would rethink the relationship again. He doesn\u2019t get to throw his toys out the pram, accuse you of STEALING and then when he manages to get you back, get all arsey because you won\u2019t help him with his finances again. He\u2019s a grown man, he needs to learn to do it. There\u2019s workshops and everything that banks do to help people. \n\nI will hold my hands up and admit I was awful with money before I met my boyfriend. I would just spend and live pay check to pay check. I was never taught properly. He didn\u2019t fully take control of my finances, but he helped me cut back on my spending (I had a genuine shopping addiction linked to my depression) and how to save and all sorts of helpful stuff. You know what I did? I thanked him and was grateful. \n\nNow we\u2019re saving for our own place and I\u2019m in a better place financially and I\u2019m eternally grateful for him helping me.

The life their income afforded them", "Sorry this was supposed to go to the comment before yours :(", "Yea, I would imagine if they are close, that type of conversation could get ugly.  I wish you luck!", "He needs to go to financial therapy.", "NTA.  I agree that you should not take over his finances.  But his asking you to do it shows me that (1) He has never really taken ownership of his shitty attitude towards you when he accused you of stealing, and (2) your response says you haven't actually forgiven him.  Couples counseling ASAP.", "NTA - once bitten, twice shy", "NTA. How could he possibly accuse you of stealing since he can see his accounts?  He should HIRE someone to help him change his bad money habits.", "Nta. Don't help him.", "You are NTA, but your bf needs a financial advisor. He is not able to manage his money on his own and you really won't be doing it for him. It sounds like you (rightfully) don't want to be in that position again and you can't trust it won't end the same way.\n\nSo it's time to pay a professional whose job it is to do this sort of thing.\n\nOtherwise I'd rethink your relationship. You can't make major shared life investments with a person who can't contribute equally due to their irresponsible spending and high debt.", "Will you fix my finances next. NTA", "NTA. He has enough money to hire an accountant or financial planner.", "Assuming that you do want to stay with him and you've forgiven him for his past actions, it seems there should be a middle ground.\n\nHave him open his bank account and then walk him through how to set up the savings accounts etc.. Once he's set it all up, you can tell him that's entirely up to him to move around the money or whatever.\n\nSo give him the tools and then back off.", "NTA\n\nYou are his GF. You are not his mommy. It is not your job to police his lack of self control.", "NTA.  He can seek a professional financial advisor/counselor.  I'm surprised you got back together again.  That was a major thing, to say you were stealing from him.  Don't know what he said, but you were an AH to yourself.  Are you sure you want this relationship?  I can't see how you are going to be a cohesive couple, TBH.", "If you want to help him get a third party to help like an accountant or something.  Sure, he will have to pay for it or maybe you can chip in (up to you of course) so he can't blame you for leaving him in the cold completely.\n\nAt no point should you help directly with his finances though, you've already been burnt once haha.", "NTA...I'm confused as to why you went back to him, did something change?  Did he do a 180?  Seems like he was okay with belittling you to his family and then realized that you were the only one who could help him. \n\nHe's immature and even though you're not getting married is this a decent partner? Think about your future plans?\n\nGood luck", "NTA - But no matter how good they tickle your fancy you don't stay in a relationship with someone who has the mental capacity of a child when it  comes to finances.", "NTA but suggest he gets an independent financial advisor which would save you the job and stop his brothers claims.", "NTA, what was his justification for accusing you of theft?", "NTA But honestly, I'm not sure why you've given someone like this a second chance after the accusations he made against you - \"accusing me of taking advantage of him and stealing his money\".\n\nNow that you've seen he's completely incapable of taking care of his finances, has he even APOLOGIZED and made AMENDS?", "NTA\n\nI suppose good for you for not marrying him because that would be a financial nightmare. Wouldn't be surprised if he started pushing for it, though, just to try and get that money mingling official.", "NTA. I would absolutely not do it.\n\nI would be willing to tell him what I did. He has access to previous statements and could see what you set up. Have him set it up himself and be willing to answer questions.\n\nHowever, this is all predicated on the fact that before I lifted a damn finger he would have to, in my presence, tell each of his brothers that I was not financially abusing him and if anything my method was beneficial and he regretted not continuing with it.\n\nI'm petty.", "Petty, probably, but NTA and you should run! This person seems to treat you right when it suits them - and only then.", "NTA.  \n\n\nas long as he is still fraternizing with his brothers, you would end up in the same place again.

He won\u2019t have savings for a house, for emergencies, for retirement (for kids?). How will you manage as a couple going forward?  At least have him take rent and savings out of his check automatically as a requirement of staying with you. Or you\u2019ll be paying for your lives all by yourself. Good luck.", "NTA - Sounds like his brothers talked him into buying things or fronting the bill for a lot. Pretty much got in his head.

He went on a vacation with his brothers who are used to taking advantage of him, he told them he \\*couldn't\\* spend his money on them or loan them/give them money because his fiance had control of his finances and he had a limit on what he was able to spend. \\*Then\\* they mocked him and gaslit him into thinking that because she had set him up in a way to save and clean up his debt that obviously she was financially abusing him and stealing all the money because he used to spend so much more and if he can't even spend what he used to, isn't that just outright theft? Of course his brothers would \\*never\\* manipulate or lie to him, so it must be true, and then it led to where he is now - without an awesome fiance willing to get threatened about his finances the next time his brothers manipulate him into thinking she's stealing from him. \n\nOP is \\*definitely\\* NTA for this one.

Instead of understanding and learning about his own finance in all this time, or even valuing OP's work to help him out. He readily blamed OP for being abusive and controlling when he still had full access to see things for himself.\n\nThis guy isn't even financially literate enough to understand what you've done for him and devalued you enough to end it based on a trip with his brothers.

Why don't you just find a brick wall and hit your head repeatedly on it - that would the equivalent of doing the same thing over and expecting a different result.
