I protect my peace when I can", "But then the person who removed you will crop up in \u201csuggested friends\u201d so the removal eventually becomes obvious.", "That seems like you have an actual reason for unfriending him. In OP's case it seems as if the wife has just removed her brother for no reason other than \"downsizing\" her friends list which is the odd part.", "In addition to unfollowing, you can change your posts to custom view which can include/exclude whoever you choose. Then if there's something you want your brother to see, switch it back to all friends. Less stress for all this way.", "Right?  Who tf cares. You wanna downsize? Just delete the entire account, you will be missing literally nothing and then no one can come back like you had favoritism for some people and not others", "This \"it's Facebook\" trope is the worst though. The people behind Facebook accounts, when they are your real people, at times take actions are actually founded. Sure not everything is serious but some things are \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You would be surprised! I removed my coworkers except the ones I knew from before. A few of them took it super personal", "I was in the Dominican when she friended me and I emailed her to confirm why. I still have the email thread and it is hilarious. I'm glad you got a good laugh as well.", "This is what I did for my oldest cousin.  I unfollowed him, so I don't get a barrage of pictures in my feed of barely clothed (g-string and pasties) adult entertainment gals in poses that are NSFW.\n\nThe tits and ass parade will go on, but without me. His immediate family doesn't follow him either. Explaining to your auntie how to unfollow her son to avoid his posts is a little surreal.", "Ah, I think that's what I did - thank you! It's been a WHILE since my last visit to fb lol", "Yes, I probably did the other thing a commenter suggested and \"unfollowed\", so I won't see her bs without hurting her.", "Ah yeah fair point", "If my sister removed me from Facebook I would completely understand, I am 100% a Facebook troll. I'm surprised she hasn't yet, that's probably because she doesn't spend as much time as I do on Facebook", "But maybe you would ask her?", "He didn't notice for months that she had removed him.", "I removed my brother after being ghosted by him.  You dont get to spy on my life after choosing not to be a part of it.  Just sayin....  she may gave her reasons", "What is with  people airing their personal issues and grievances and oversharng on social media in general??", "*They said, without a hint of irony, in a subreddit dedicated to airing out personal issues and grievances.*", "I don't know.  Why do young people display everything they've got on tiktok, or bitch and moan and overshare incessantly on reddit?", "Have you ask the same question for young people abou tik tok and instagram?", "Same! I ain't nothing but a shitposter. Nothing but dumb memes on my time line. When my friendslist shrinks, I'm just like, \"understandable, have a nice day.\" Lol", "Whoa! Let's not do anything crazy.", "We don't hold with that \"doing something rational\" stuff in these here parts.", "Logic. Something OP's BIL doesn't seem to have.", "Attention I think? Or need to feel important? I guess for some people any attention is good attention\u2026", "I uninstalled Facebook over a year ago and I couldn't be happier.i reinstalled it back in June so I could get pictures of my mom who passed. Then quickly uninstalled again. I have no information about me on social media.", "Yeah but it\u2019s anonymous here. Unless you go out of your way to expose the identities of those involved, the only way for people to figure it out is for someone connected to the event to stumble across the post and put the pieces together. Reddit isn\u2019t really \u201csocial media\u201d in the same way Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter are. Airing personal grievances and drama on Facebook, in which you know for an absolute fact that people in your life are going to find, is much different than anonymously posting on a subreddit with fake/obscured names, dates, and locations.", "I am a millennial, but I don\u2019t get Gen Z\u2019s obsession with that either. The desire for likes and to become an influencer plays into it I think.", "I think the obsession with becoming internet/social media famous has polluted their brains. With \u201cinfluencers\u201d being treated like actual celebrities it has become even worse.", "Don't forget validation seekers. They air their dirty laundry because they want people to take their side, reguardless of who is in the right, they expect friends and family to have their back. Always fun to see this backfire explosively.", "Yeah I've done pretty much the same. Very occasionally go back for something specific but we're talking about once a month. Now if I could just kick my Reddit habit...", "Reddit isn't much better, this place is like the toxic waste pool directly next or the toxic waste lake. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Not really, we just want to let other people what we like and to communicate it fast... why? Because we know how long it took mail and phone calls... we didn't have the \"right now\" tech in our youth... you have all these information at hand and whichever you want it and still need the feel for approval from people around the world"]}
