Sounds like your family are a bunch of drama llamas.", "You ask one question in the title, but really I think your question is about overall how you handled this.  So NTA for inquiring why your BIL thought wife was removed.  Kinda TA for your judgment \"very mature mate\" which is bound to make him defensive and shift the tone of the conversation.  But really this seems to be a pretty minor thing.\n\nYour style of communication is pretty minimalist and confusing so you aren't doing yourself any favors there either.\n\nYour in-laws seem like they want to be upset.", "NTA. Tell your wife to talk to her brother.", "NTA, and don\u2019t even need to speculate on why this happened.", "ESH, but mostly YTA\n\nWhy a sister removed her brother from her FB is between them -- and it would be VERY sensitive -- removing immediate family members while keeping friends? You should have just told him to discuss it with his sister -- you made it sound like not a big deal -- it would be a sensitive issue to many.\n\nAnd he was clearly hurt -- you chose to jump to respond with a comment about making a leap. That was cold. And you didn't read a room.\n\nHe's an AH for not approaching sis instead of you, however.\n\nBUT was this chat all on Signal itself? Could you have just asked (edit: his) sis to jump in and handle it? (= meaning the part about FB)", "You made this so much worse. There\u2019s only one thing to say and to say it on repeat: I didn\u2019t take you out of the group-you should check about what\u2019s wrong with your phone. \n\nThe FB issue should not have been commented on. You should have said that you didn\u2019t know about that. Why are you speaking for your wife? You basically confirmed several things for him 1) that you\u2019re lying, 2) that you and wife talk about him behind his back, and several others. Neither of these things might be true, but he is definitely going to believe them now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
