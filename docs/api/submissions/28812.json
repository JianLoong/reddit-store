Sounds like your family are a bunch of drama llamas.", "You ask one question in the title, but really I think your question is about overall how you handled this.  So NTA for inquiring why your BIL thought wife was removed.  Kinda TA for your judgment \"very mature mate\" which is bound to make him defensive and shift the tone of the conversation.  But really this seems to be a pretty minor thing.\n\nYour style of communication is pretty minimalist and confusing so you aren't doing yourself any favors there either.\n\nYour in-laws seem like they want to be upset.", "NTA. Tell your wife to talk to her brother.", "NTA, and don\u2019t even need to speculate on why this happened.", "ESH, but mostly YTA\n\nWhy a sister removed her brother from her FB is between them -- and it would be VERY sensitive -- removing immediate family members while keeping friends? You should have just told him to discuss it with his sister -- you made it sound like not a big deal -- it would be a sensitive issue to many.\n\nAnd he was clearly hurt -- you chose to jump to respond with a comment about making a leap. That was cold. And you didn't read a room.\n\nHe's an AH for not approaching sis instead of you, however.\n\nBUT was this chat all on Signal itself? Could you have just asked (edit: his) sis to jump in and handle it? (= meaning the part about FB)", "You made this so much worse. There\u2019s only one thing to say and to say it on repeat: I didn\u2019t take you out of the group-you should check about what\u2019s wrong with your phone. \n\nThe FB issue should not have been commented on. You should have said that you didn\u2019t know about that. Why are you speaking for your wife? You basically confirmed several things for him 1) that you\u2019re lying, 2) that you and wife talk about him behind his back, and several others. Neither of these things might be true, but he is definitely going to believe them now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have immediate family who I\u2019ve  deleted from facebook, I don\u2019t enjoy seeing their day to day drama but I\u2019m still in group chats with them. Sometimes people have a much different public face and I\u2019m not interested in that one and it gets old doing the snooze for 2 weeks or whatever it is constantly, doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t like who they really are. I don\u2019t think OP needed to to tell his BIL to go talk to his own sister, that should\u2019ve been on him already. NTA.", "Yeah, I didn't handle this as well as I could have, thanks for calling me out", "You're right, damn, I didn't think about it like that", "Or maybe expressed yourself in several complete sentences to say exactly what you mean? Or picked up the phone and talked?\n\nAdding another cryptic comment to the chat helps nothing.", "ESH. How are grown adults involved in so much drama over social media & group chats? This would be dumb but somewhat age appropriate if you were teens still learning how to interact with others but it\u2019s literally insane to spend your middle age & golden years like this.", "It is weird to unfriend your brother on Facebook. You should have told your BIL to talk to his sister about that as it's her Facebook. You stirred as much drama as your BIL did. ESH", "NTA but I'd say your wife maybe has to justify her decision to remove him from Facebook in some way. I'm not saying everyone you delete deserves a reason, but saying to you BIL she is 'downsizing' is a BS excuse. I wouldn't accept it. There's more to it man", "NTA, sounds like somethings gone on between your wife and her brother, and he's trying his best to pull you into it. Personally, I'd have told him to grow up and whine to his sister, not you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "NTA, but you commenting on why your wife removed him from your fb wasn't the smartest. I would take offense if someone decided that part of downsizing was getting rid of accounts of close family members. Kinda says ...you are not important enough. Now you or your wife might not care about the fb thing, but your BIL clearly does, and/or already had some issues connected to being included in things. Best to talk this out between you, your wife, BIL and SIL, or this will come up over and over again.", "All I can see is the meme of the cyclist poking a stick in his front tire and falling over before proclaiming \"Fucking family!\"\n\nWhat needless drama haha NTA", "NTA - it's social media and a Whatsapp group...", "NTA. Don't worry about it. This happened to my BiL too, he left the family group over some very petty things too. \ud83d\ude44. My sis, his wife, didn't say anything. \n\none day we were having lunch at my house. we were chatting about something he didn't know. I said oh, you don't know because we discussed in the WhatsApp group that YOU left.\n\nWhy didn't you add me back in?\n\nWhy should I? You left,  drama queen!\n\nWhy didn't you coax me to go back in?\n\nCoax you??? I don't have time to entertain a big baby!\n\nI was laughing at him all the while. And my sister all the while kept saying don't let him in. Don't let him in... He's back in.", "NTA\n\nHe removed himself you did nothing wrong.\n\nIf he wants to know why his sister removed him from FB he should ask her.", "NTA i mean you have literally done nothing at all", "Uhh, how tech illiterate are these people to not know how group chats work?\n\nNTA", "NTA. BIL is quite dramatic, he clearly inherited from his parents.", "NTA", "NTA and what was any of it to do with you, why couldn't he just talk directly to his sister?", "So i went through this when I became tired of the memes a lot of family were posting.  There was lots of drama when they realized they were unfriended.   I honestly didn't think they would notice.  But since then I have learned to unfollow instead.  I don't have ro see their nonsense and Facebook doesn't tell them we are unfriendly.  Highly suggest", "NTA, but I think there's more to this that your wife hasn't told you about. Normally, if you downsize your FB friends, you start with the old school friends you haven't seen for 20 years, not your siblings.", "Except his responses fuelled the drama unnecessarily. They are ALL the assholes, OP included.", "I unfriended my sister on Facebook because we don't get along at all and I am very low contact with her.\n\nUnfriending a sibling on Facebook sends that sort of message. No wonder BIL is upset.", "Honestly, it's not weird deleting someone even if it's your brother. \nI know multiple people who don't have either siblings, aunts or stuff on Facebook or had deleted them becouse they either snooped too much in stuff they were posting, commented weird things on their posts, or they got tired of seeing a constant flow of drama posts from a family member. \n\nPeople take Facebook way too seriously today. \nWith all the, if you don't have me on Facebook, then you must hate me. Or similar comments/being offended.\nWe have phones, text messages, and the option to call someone. You can even send postcards. Emails. \nCatch up at family events. Be in family group chats on different media's. Take a vacation and visit someone.\nIt's really not that big of a deal.", "Yes but your wife is weird too. NTA", "All of the fun of family drama without having to dodge thrown crockery.  This is why we live the internet.", "Yeah, your sister removed you because she is downsizing, is a damn offensive reason to give to sibling. \n\nLike sorry mate you didn't make the cut along with her other acquaintances. \n\nClearly there's bad blood there but you shouldn't have fanned the flames and should have let her deal with that.", "\"Unfollow\" was FB's best ever invention.   I will never again have to see my MIL's political rants...but she'll never know it.", "Why not just remove their posts from your feed?", "I just unfollow them.", "I thought this as well... fair enough downsize your friends list but why would you remove your brother without reason?

It's Facebook", "Based on ages I\u2019d say Facebook is their primary social", "I think I'd care if my sister randomly removed me... I'd be worrying I'd done something to upset her or something.", "What is it with older people putting too much stock in Facebook? Or like airing personal issues or grievances on there? Ohhhh and the massive oversharing.", "Apparently he had been removed for months and hadn't noticed. Can't be that primary to him."]}
