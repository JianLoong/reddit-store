I own an acoustic and an electric guitar, but i was not satisfied with my amp. It was a peavey envoy silverstripe 110, a weak one, almost at it's death and i couldn't fix it ( for a reasonable price) nor play on it at all. Wo naturally i went to work for some extra cash. I went to install floor heating in a workspace for a company. All in all, i installed 4km of heating pipes by myself. Then i went across 5 countries just to get a guitar amp of my dreams (6505+ 112).              I wrote all of this just for context as for how much i did just to get a guitar amp and how much it means to me.                                                                             Now fast forward to yesterday, when i invited my friend to play some table tennis and videogames. It was all going great untill we got to play a local multiplayer game. I insisted i bring another chair to sit on, but he was insisting that my guitar amplifier was strong enough to support his weight. I just told him no, i will get a kitchen chair for myself and he can sit in my computer chair. As i cane back, he completely ignored what i said and proceeded to demonstrate how it is strong enough by practically jumping on it. I without any thought kicked him out of the house for today. He called me a bitch for putting my possesions in front of our friendship, and idk what to think about that. Also nothing happened to the amp, so i am starting to think that i was a dick in this situation.

Nothing wrong with sticking up for yourself.", "No. NtA. \n\nYou set a boundary,  provided an option and solution to make everybody happy and comfortable. And your friends reaction is to literally jump across that boundary. \n\nAnd when you defend your property and boundary,  they turn it around on you for \" putting YOUR possessions \" before the friendship.\n\nIt sounds like your friend doesn't want you to have nice things. \ud83d\ude15", "NTA\n\nOkay I was gonna say YTA until they started jumping on it.

You even offered your own chair which was a very nice gesture and actually pretty mature. But he choose to ignore your wish.", "From another guitar player to another, amps are pretty good for sitting and storing dinner plates (Shh, my mooer doesn't complain.) etc. But yeah, I get it. They're resilient, for sure, but another thing they are, is fucking expensive. NTA, especially after the jumping demonstration.", "NTA.\n\nHe decided to prioritize expressing his disdain for what's important to you over your friendship.  When you reacted reasonably, he further decided to get pissed off and mistreat you further instead of apologizing.  That just reinforces that maybe your friendship isn't as important to him as he claims.\n\nI'm glad your amp is fine.  It could have gone differently.  You did the right thing.", "NTA, you did tell him not to sit on the amp. And offered him the better chair while you went to get a normal one. \n\nIt's not putting your possesions in front of a friendship, it's being annoyed that somebody doesn't respect your possesions. Would he like if he had something that was expensive and meant a lot to you and you demonstrated attemting to break it to show that it could withstand what you were doing? I wouldn't be impressed if one of my friends did that. And I don't go into my friends'' houses and attempt to break expensive things to show that they are indestructable. \n\nThere is also, maybe jumping on it once will do no harm, but if it became a common occurance for him to jump on the amp when he comes over, that it's his seat from now on. It could get damaged over time and not last as long as it would if it is respected. Like most things. Hey, back in the days of the PS1, I didn't kick him out but I stopped inviting a friend up because he played all my games and whenever he finished one he left the disk on the floor. I always put a game back in the correct box and back on the shelf after use. Leaving a disk on a floor once is probabvly not going to break it, but if person A keeps throwing disks on the floor after use while person B stores them correctly, Person B's games will probably last longer. \n\nI'd say you could stay friends, just tell him you don't want the Amp to be sat on, it will last longer if it is respected and he wouldn't appreciate if you sat on his most expensive possesion that is not designed to be sat on.", "NTA - even if it had been a chair.

Yeah. And if the OP offered no other options I'd call them the AH. \n\nBut OP was providing other options and the friend ignored them just to prove they were right.", "Exactly. It's not a piece of furniture. OP asked the guy not to sit on it (sounds like OP was pretty nice about it and didn't jump down his throat) and the dude INSISTED on using it as furniture despite OP's expressly stated wishes and despite OP providing an actual piece of furniture to sit on. \n\nWho cares how sturdy it is? That's fucking disrespectful as hell. I would NEVER come into someone's house and insist on sitting on the one thing I was asked not to."]}
