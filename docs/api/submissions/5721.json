You mentioned it was 40 and windy. Windchill makes it feel much colder than it is, and if she wasn't expecting to walk home, I'm not sure she was dressed for spending prolonged time out in the cold.

Making the girl pay for the Uber would have a safer, but natural consequence.", "For sure. I think my opinion may have been lost in translation. What I think: OP is NTA. The 13-year-old made a bad choice. It was a developmentally typical choice and not one that signals any real problems, but a bad choice nonetheless. When teens make bad choices they should experience consequences. She was given the consequence of walking. She hated it. Great, lesson hopefully learned. An apology would be good too. Further punishment is not necessary."]}
