Back when I was young and healthy, I ended up with a punishment where I had to do physical work whereas my brother simply couldn't do it. Just like my chores were dishes because he had severe allergies and couldn't touch some of the foods. It is what it is, you know?", "There is a difference between the able bodied 13 year old and the medically challenged 15 year old. 13 year old can walk just fine. 15 year old can't walk very much. It's not a double standard.", "It\u2019s not a double standard. I wouldn\u2019t make 15 do that walk because it\u2019s very likely that she physically can\u2019t walk that far, especially in that weather. If she did manage to do it, there\u2019s a good chance it could affect her health.", "How did the other parents react when the nanny called and explained they were walking?", "with sidewalks", "She hasn\u2019t gone out since then so there\u2019s no way to really tell but I think she did", "I walked two miles one way by myself all the time at 13 and I was fine. If she's in a group and they're not being stupid, it's fine.", "The nanny did while they were walking.", "That's not the death rate of covid. What is wrong with you?", "Jesus wept", "Have you ever been to a city?  Neighborhoods change quickly.  It's very possible she would have to walk through bad areas in 2 miles.  Shit, where I live it could literally be a block.", "They were okay with it. Most said they would\u2019ve done the same.", "NTA good dad!", "\"And they're not being stupid\". \n\nThat's a pretty tall order for 13 year olds. Teenagers are not known for their fantastic decision making skills.", "They should've been contacted before that. \"My step child made a poor decision and now has to walk home, please arrange other methods of transportation for your child if you're uncomfortable with that.\" You were the responsible party in this situation and were entrusted by other parents with their kids. If it were just your child, then I could chalk this up to parenting differences between the two of us, but you made that decision for 10 other people's children, which is bad form.", "In the us there\u2019s 1 million Covid deaths divided by 332 million people equals .003%\n\nMy point was, less than 1% isn\u2019t 0%.", "Then you are good.\n\nYou and the nanny taught her via natural consequences. She chose to be rude, entitled and dismissive of her nanny's time and so she lost the privilege that was afforded to her by the nanny. She won't be so quick to ignore texts and calls next time she is asking for a ride home.", "Pretty sure that 13 year olds know how to not run into traffic.", "they're 13 only walking 2 miles after they blew off their ride..."]}
