{"id": 15187, "submission_id": "12s0n85", "title": "AITA for not wanting my 9 year old son to stay with people I don't know for a week?", "selftext": " My son's father and I have been split up for 3 years, shortly after he met his partner and they've been together. She seems very kind and nice, And when I realized they were serious I really wanted to get to know her but she has kind of kept her distance from me? They met in the place that her family lives, which is 11 hours away from me and now they live in another state which is about 11 hours away from her hometown. \n\nMy son has gotten to know her and her family pretty well, and they genuinely do seem to adore him but here's where I'm having an issue: has Dad told me that he has made plans for our son to spend 2 weeks in her hometown over the summer, but is going back home after a week. Meaning my son will stay with her parents for a week. \n\nHe thinks this is super reasonable but to me it's just crazy to think that it's okay for a 9 yr old to stay with people that I've not only never met like I don't even know their names?! \n\nI'm super uncomfortable with it, for so many reasons, but primarily that I just don't know or have any kind of relationship with these people. And I do believe that they trust them but it's just so far and so long. I wouldn't be comfortable with him staying, without me or his dad, with ANYONE other than grandparents ( mine or his parents). \n\nThere's a lot of reasons, but mostly it's just because I don't know them. I find it a little bit concerning that everybody on that side doesn't see how I would be uncomfortable when they've made effort  to get to know me. I'm his mom and I take care of him 24/7, dad sees him as often as he can, and over the summer for a few weeks. I feel like my opinions should be considered! I don't know their value systems, I don't know what kind of discipline they use, I don't know what kind of environment he'll be in? He'll also be more than 10 hours away from either of us in an area that's relatively remote, that's really far if there's any kind of emergency it's not like we can just pick him up in an hour!! \n\n And I know this is like jumping to worst case scenario, but statistically children are most likely to be abused by people they know, Even though that's not really a friend of the mind concern.  All of it together just doesn't sit right with me.\n\nBut now his dad is pissed at me, because he thinks I'm being unreasonable and that I should trust him to not ever put our son in a bad situation. I'm feeling really guilty because I don't think he would, but  I think this is just crazy and I can't believe that they would first of all even think that it would be okay but then even more so try to make that decision unilaterally without seeing how I felt about it?! \n\nBut I also don't want to rob  my son of fun and being around people that care about him so I'm so conflicted.\n\nEdit: to anyone poo pooing his dad, that's absolutely not something I'm trying to do or want anyone else to do. To clarify, over the course of summer he'll spend 4 to 5 weeks with his dad. So he will still get plenty of time.\n\nSecondly, there is no custody agreement, this is not \"his\" custody time. I have been taking care of him exclusively since he was born, but I make every opportunity for them to see each other possible.\n\nLast point, I fully agree with the couple people who have said if it was for a weekend or something. Honestly I would still feel desperately uncomfortable because I literally don't even know these people's names. And I find it really concerning that they built a relationship with him without wanting to get to know me at all? But I would also say yes because it's not as unreasonable as a request. \n\nMy concerns are very much the fact that I have no relationship with these people and don't know anything about them, And also that it's a fairly remote area far away. What if there's a medical emergency? What are their value systems, what do they believe and what will they be exposing my son to? He has ADD, How are they going to treat him in disciplinary situations? He also has a lot of food aversion anxiety, while I don't pander to it, How are they going to treat him when he has a shutdown over a food they prepared? I've never seen them interact with him, I don't know any of these things And say my son for a whole week at 9:00 when he's never been away from a parent for that long seems absurd to me.\n\nEdit 2: his dad has never made any super questionable decisions, and maybe I'm super wrong in feeling this way, but I feel like a group of adults not only making plans for a child but also telling him about those plans without including me in the conversation at all is questionable in itself. The fact that didn't even ask my thoughts or my input feels scary, because I want to know that they realize that I should be a part of ALL decision making. And for contacts this plan has been made including dates without any consideration to how I felt about it or if we were doing anything and that it was a good time.", "created_utc": 1681920673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s0n85/aita_for_not_wanting_my_9_year_old_son_to_stay/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have never had issues with him making bad decisions on who can be in his life so legally I can't say shit.  Nor should I be able to, I should not be able to prevent my from creating new relationships.  If you do you become high conflict and end up in court every 6 months because your expectations are unreasonable.  I need a babysitter and I have to get my ex to screen my aunts bf who I have known my whole life but the ex never met? Not reasonable.  Not sure a judge will ever agree to this limit without cause.\n\nIt sounds like this is a great experience and she has nothing saying that it is wrong.  She has to trust her ex to parent properly which it sounds like he does.  This is what happens when you get divorced.  It is not reasonable to expect to meet all your exes new relationships although your son will.", "NTA", "They are parents split up and each one has the kid for certain time and can decide what to do during that time.", "Well that's not true. For example, you can't leave the country without the other parents consent. Your rights as a parent aren't void for the time the other parent is supervising. Both parents get a say in major decisions, such as leaving a child for a week in a remote area with virtual strangers. There is also a very easy way to fix this. Just have OP meet the family before hand. But her ex isn't making that effort. He's just telling OP to trust his word without any back up and potentially putting the kid in danger. I would put my foot down too if i was OP.", "ESH\n\nYou don't have a right to know everyone in your ex's life. Your ex shouldn't go away during the few times he can see the kid.", "ESH.  This is part of being an extended family.  Have you asked you son how he feels about it?  We had kids go for trips with us that their parents don\u2019t really know us more than a cursory hello.  It was never a problem.  I think you should either defer to your son or tell your husband you will agree to one week.  They know your son and care for him.  Most parents don\u2019t try to kill off other people\u2019s kids while they are in their care.  Accidents can happen in your own home.  As long as you can talk to your son every night, you can monitor how he feels being there.", "NTA\n\nYou are looking out for your child and all the concerns you listed are valid. You don't know these people. That 'everyone' else thinks the arrangement is perfectly acceptable is baffling to me.\n\nSo -- you have options. Yes, it is far away. Thankfully we have technology that can help that. Skype with them. Zoom with them. Talk. Have them show you (on their laptop/phone) around their house. Have a list of specific questions to ask them (discipline, food, activities, in case of emergency, etc.) Your child should have a phone with your number programmed in it and they should know how to use it. You should ask for daily calls home when he's gone.\n\nThis is something that is do-able, with some work beforehand. You have the time now to work out these kinds of details. Stick to your guns. You are not doing anything wrong.\n\nHonestly, if this were me, I would take off work and go someplace that is closer to where he will be. Say, 3-4 hours away. I would stay there so I was much closer. Just in case something happened.", "NTA I know people who write into their parenting agreements that each parent has first option as carer if the other parent can\u2019t care during their allotted time. I wish my parents had that written into their agreements rather than me being sent to stay with random work colleagues while my parents traveled.\n\nPerhaps get yourself a parenting agreement.", "Your ex knows them. He has spent time with them. Your son is comfortable around them. Are you telling me ex knew all the people you exposed son to?\n\nI get the feelings, but YTA. A small one but YTA", "NTA - if dad can\u2019t look after him for that week, why isn\u2019t he dropping him back to you?", "NTA. I dont even get why?! If he is leaving he can send your kid back home. I would not allow my kid to be alone with people I dont know under any circumstances.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t do it, please ! Out your foot down on this, as the custodial parent your child shouldn\u2019t be staying with anyone you don\u2019t know without his father or you", "OP=NTA\n\n1) Call a lawyer, give him your legal facts(no custodial agreement, etc).  Find out what your legal options are. \n\n2) Will Dad give them legal right to get medical aid if needed(Can he give legal authority alone? Or Do you need to do so too--see #1)\n\n3) Tell Ex--that If you meet them(in your town when they visit) and get a chance to see them INTERACT with your son, then you will consider allowing it this summer.  But that you will not approve your son staying with strangers for a week.  (again #1, you need a lawyer to tell you if you can make this statement and back it up legally)\n\n4) Could this be a set up(redditor conspiracy alert) where your Ex is trying to switch to a jurisdiction to have a more favorable opportunity for custody?  Is GF looking for motherhood without pregnancy?", "NTA\n\nseems entirely reasonable you\u2019d want to know these people. Just because these people\u2019s daughter is dating your ex, doesn\u2019t say jack about her and them  \n\nAnd yeah\u2014it\u2019s the height of disrespect to any parent to do what your ex and his girlfriend have done. They don\u2019t respect you and they\u2019re showing it. Her parents don\u2019t respect you and are showing it\n\nDo not be a doormat just because he\u2019s your kid\u2019s father. Coparenting requires MUTUAL respect. Not different than any other relationship. If this is how he acted when you were together, I can see why you\u2019re separated\n\nAlso GET a custody agreement. If you\u2019re sending your kid 11 hours away to see daddy, you need one. It\u2019s not just down the street. What happens if your son doesn\u2019t come back from 11 hours away? Then what? He\u2019s the kid\u2019s father. What laws have been broken? None maybe. But court orders can help", "NTA. What are the custody laws in that state? You don't wanna get fucked over and have to fight to get him back bc there's no custody on the books before he went.", "NTA you\u2019re right about abuse and that\u2019s my first thought. The kid is too young and if someone wanted to harm him it would be the perfect opportunity since he doesn\u2019t have a parent there. A gf for 3 years isn\u2019t a parent. Your husband is blind to the risk which makes it worse. Don\u2019t let him leave your son alone. They aren\u2019t people you know and you just can\u2019t trust them. It doesn\u2019t matter if you hurt feelings your kids health and safety is first.", "\\^\\^this. \n\nThese people may be totally fine and wonderful - but you don't know that yet. \n\nYour son stays with his dad the whole time, or dad brings him home after the first week.", "Is it really co-parenting if she takes care of their son exclusively, and he only takes care of him for a couple of week in the summer (one of those weeks he's willing to dump them and leave himself)?", "It seems very cut and dried to me. Custodial parent has the final say in custodial decisions.", "Oh ok fair enough, I still think you are 100% in the right for not wanting him to stay there alone. His spending 1 week there with his dad, that\u2019s plenty of time to have as much as he wants. \n\nPeople may not agree with me but it\u2019s always going to be safety over fun when it comes to your child (in situations like this of course).", "No, no, no. My dad did things like this to my mom, and now that I\u2019m an adult, I see how unfair it all was to her. I know it\u2019ll be hard because your son is excited, but his safety comes first, and you are the person in charge of his safety.", "They didn't even bother telling you?!", "maybe dad needs to get back to work but son and gfs family want to spend more time together? idk. OP is fully NTA."]}
