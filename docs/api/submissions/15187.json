{"id": 15187, "submission_id": "12s0n85", "title": "AITA for not wanting my 9 year old son to stay with people I don't know for a week?", "selftext": " My son's father and I have been split up for 3 years, shortly after he met his partner and they've been together. She seems very kind and nice, And when I realized they were serious I really wanted to get to know her but she has kind of kept her distance from me? They met in the place that her family lives, which is 11 hours away from me and now they live in another state which is about 11 hours away from her hometown. \n\nMy son has gotten to know her and her family pretty well, and they genuinely do seem to adore him but here's where I'm having an issue: has Dad told me that he has made plans for our son to spend 2 weeks in her hometown over the summer, but is going back home after a week. Meaning my son will stay with her parents for a week. \n\nHe thinks this is super reasonable but to me it's just crazy to think that it's okay for a 9 yr old to stay with people that I've not only never met like I don't even know their names?! \n\nI'm super uncomfortable with it, for so many reasons, but primarily that I just don't know or have any kind of relationship with these people. And I do believe that they trust them but it's just so far and so long. I wouldn't be comfortable with him staying, without me or his dad, with ANYONE other than grandparents ( mine or his parents). \n\nThere's a lot of reasons, but mostly it's just because I don't know them. I find it a little bit concerning that everybody on that side doesn't see how I would be uncomfortable when they've made effort  to get to know me. I'm his mom and I take care of him 24/7, dad sees him as often as he can, and over the summer for a few weeks. I feel like my opinions should be considered! I don't know their value systems, I don't know what kind of discipline they use, I don't know what kind of environment he'll be in? He'll also be more than 10 hours away from either of us in an area that's relatively remote, that's really far if there's any kind of emergency it's not like we can just pick him up in an hour!! \n\n And I know this is like jumping to worst case scenario, but statistically children are most likely to be abused by people they know, Even though that's not really a friend of the mind concern.  All of it together just doesn't sit right with me.\n\nBut now his dad is pissed at me, because he thinks I'm being unreasonable and that I should trust him to not ever put our son in a bad situation. I'm feeling really guilty because I don't think he would, but  I think this is just crazy and I can't believe that they would first of all even think that it would be okay but then even more so try to make that decision unilaterally without seeing how I felt about it?! \n\nBut I also don't want to rob  my son of fun and being around people that care about him so I'm so conflicted.\n\nEdit: to anyone poo pooing his dad, that's absolutely not something I'm trying to do or want anyone else to do. To clarify, over the course of summer he'll spend 4 to 5 weeks with his dad. So he will still get plenty of time.\n\nSecondly, there is no custody agreement, this is not \"his\" custody time. I have been taking care of him exclusively since he was born, but I make every opportunity for them to see each other possible.\n\nLast point, I fully agree with the couple people who have said if it was for a weekend or something. Honestly I would still feel desperately uncomfortable because I literally don't even know these people's names. And I find it really concerning that they built a relationship with him without wanting to get to know me at all? But I would also say yes because it's not as unreasonable as a request. \n\nMy concerns are very much the fact that I have no relationship with these people and don't know anything about them, And also that it's a fairly remote area far away. What if there's a medical emergency? What are their value systems, what do they believe and what will they be exposing my son to? He has ADD, How are they going to treat him in disciplinary situations? He also has a lot of food aversion anxiety, while I don't pander to it, How are they going to treat him when he has a shutdown over a food they prepared? I've never seen them interact with him, I don't know any of these things And say my son for a whole week at 9:00 when he's never been away from a parent for that long seems absurd to me.\n\nEdit 2: his dad has never made any super questionable decisions, and maybe I'm super wrong in feeling this way, but I feel like a group of adults not only making plans for a child but also telling him about those plans without including me in the conversation at all is questionable in itself. The fact that didn't even ask my thoughts or my input feels scary, because I want to know that they realize that I should be a part of ALL decision making. And for contacts this plan has been made including dates without any consideration to how I felt about it or if we were doing anything and that it was a good time.", "created_utc": 1681920673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s0n85/aita_for_not_wanting_my_9_year_old_son_to_stay/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have always made any and every moment that his dad is able to spend with him available to him. But he's not spending a week of his dad's custody time with them He's spending a week of his summer", "You should trust your instincts. Your ex is actually shirking his duties by leaving his son in the care of strangers (to you) for a week without being there to supervise.\n\nStick to your guns on this one. Either dad stays with son the entire 2 weeks, or son comes back home to you after 1 week. Do not negotiate. And stand firm, until you have had a chance to vet these people and decide if you are comfortable with your son being around them unsupervised."]}
