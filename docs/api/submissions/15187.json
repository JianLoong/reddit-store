{"id": 15187, "submission_id": "12s0n85", "title": "AITA for not wanting my 9 year old son to stay with people I don't know for a week?", "selftext": " My son's father and I have been split up for 3 years, shortly after he met his partner and they've been together. She seems very kind and nice, And when I realized they were serious I really wanted to get to know her but she has kind of kept her distance from me? They met in the place that her family lives, which is 11 hours away from me and now they live in another state which is about 11 hours away from her hometown. \n\nMy son has gotten to know her and her family pretty well, and they genuinely do seem to adore him but here's where I'm having an issue: has Dad told me that he has made plans for our son to spend 2 weeks in her hometown over the summer, but is going back home after a week. Meaning my son will stay with her parents for a week. \n\nHe thinks this is super reasonable but to me it's just crazy to think that it's okay for a 9 yr old to stay with people that I've not only never met like I don't even know their names?! \n\nI'm super uncomfortable with it, for so many reasons, but primarily that I just don't know or have any kind of relationship with these people. And I do believe that they trust them but it's just so far and so long. I wouldn't be comfortable with him staying, without me or his dad, with ANYONE other than grandparents ( mine or his parents). \n\nThere's a lot of reasons, but mostly it's just because I don't know them. I find it a little bit concerning that everybody on that side doesn't see how I would be uncomfortable when they've made effort  to get to know me. I'm his mom and I take care of him 24/7, dad sees him as often as he can, and over the summer for a few weeks. I feel like my opinions should be considered! I don't know their value systems, I don't know what kind of discipline they use, I don't know what kind of environment he'll be in? He'll also be more than 10 hours away from either of us in an area that's relatively remote, that's really far if there's any kind of emergency it's not like we can just pick him up in an hour!! \n\n And I know this is like jumping to worst case scenario, but statistically children are most likely to be abused by people they know, Even though that's not really a friend of the mind concern.  All of it together just doesn't sit right with me.\n\nBut now his dad is pissed at me, because he thinks I'm being unreasonable and that I should trust him to not ever put our son in a bad situation. I'm feeling really guilty because I don't think he would, but  I think this is just crazy and I can't believe that they would first of all even think that it would be okay but then even more so try to make that decision unilaterally without seeing how I felt about it?! \n\nBut I also don't want to rob  my son of fun and being around people that care about him so I'm so conflicted.\n\nEdit: to anyone poo pooing his dad, that's absolutely not something I'm trying to do or want anyone else to do. To clarify, over the course of summer he'll spend 4 to 5 weeks with his dad. So he will still get plenty of time.\n\nSecondly, there is no custody agreement, this is not \"his\" custody time. I have been taking care of him exclusively since he was born, but I make every opportunity for them to see each other possible.\n\nLast point, I fully agree with the couple people who have said if it was for a weekend or something. Honestly I would still feel desperately uncomfortable because I literally don't even know these people's names. And I find it really concerning that they built a relationship with him without wanting to get to know me at all? But I would also say yes because it's not as unreasonable as a request. \n\nMy concerns are very much the fact that I have no relationship with these people and don't know anything about them, And also that it's a fairly remote area far away. What if there's a medical emergency? What are their value systems, what do they believe and what will they be exposing my son to? He has ADD, How are they going to treat him in disciplinary situations? He also has a lot of food aversion anxiety, while I don't pander to it, How are they going to treat him when he has a shutdown over a food they prepared? I've never seen them interact with him, I don't know any of these things And say my son for a whole week at 9:00 when he's never been away from a parent for that long seems absurd to me.\n\nEdit 2: his dad has never made any super questionable decisions, and maybe I'm super wrong in feeling this way, but I feel like a group of adults not only making plans for a child but also telling him about those plans without including me in the conversation at all is questionable in itself. The fact that didn't even ask my thoughts or my input feels scary, because I want to know that they realize that I should be a part of ALL decision making. And for contacts this plan has been made including dates without any consideration to how I felt about it or if we were doing anything and that it was a good time.", "created_utc": 1681920673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s0n85/aita_for_not_wanting_my_9_year_old_son_to_stay/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is to happen in the summer.\n\nI can understand the basis of your concerns, and can also understand the frustration from your ex.\n\nWith the timescale involved it seems like both sides are missing a reasonable solution that could let everyone be happy.\n\nInstead of you and ex snapping at one another, how about working together to introduce yourself to these people you don\u2019t know? You admit to jumping to worst case scenario, tapping into that fear. The best treatment for fear is knowledge. You want to know about these people, their beliefs and values, their thoughts on discipline? Want to help them deal with any neurodivergence issues?\n\nReach out and talk to them. Get your ex and his partner to help. Video calling has become a great deal more useful over the past few years. You have several weeks to speak to them and hopefully put your fears to rest. Your ex wants this to happen. Their partner wants this to happen. Her parents want it to happen. Your son wants it to happen. This would seem like a solution.\n\nRight now ESH (applying to you and your ex). That will remain unless you start trying to apply this simple fix to the situation.\n\nCurrently what you have is unfounded fear, and time to correct that.\n\nYour choices are either start talking, or keep fighting each other. Your son is absolutely guaranteed to suffer and if you choose the latter.\n\nIf you talk to them, learn more about them, and find that there are genuine reasons for concern, then the argument is justified.

Info: why is he staying there and not with you for that week?", "NTA\n\nWould your ex feel the same if you took your son 11 hours away, to meet a bf\u2019s family, and then left him for a week, by himself, with people that his father doesn\u2019t know?\n\nI suspect not. \n\nI don\u2019t have children, but would fervently reject this request", "NAH. How does your son feel about this trip? Does he want to go? Make sure he knows that he can tell you how he really feels, and won't get in trouble either way. It's not odd for the step-parents family to not try to get to know the other parent. I would ask your ex to arrange a video call with the step-grandparents. Talk about all your worries, see how your son feels about the trip, and go from there. You can always get a hotel room close to them for thst week, and give your son a cell phone for that trip.", "NTA but try to find solutions instead of second guessing.

Don't let him go. The other option is let him go but pick him up just before the father leaves.", "NTA for all the reasons you mentioned but one thing I would tell him is that anyone you allow him to be with should be able to tell him no or gently correct his behavior. You don't know these people at all so you would not give them permission to discipline your child. What kind of discipline do they use? They might be \"great\" people who think swatting a child on their butt is appropriate. Hell no! Don't budge.", "NTA.  The answer has to be no.  If they lived within an hour of you and committed to getting to know you first, then maybe it would be okay, but your child will be a day\u2019s journey away.

Your ex knows there is no official structure do showing him that his usurpation of your parental role has caused you to pursue making everything official.

I\u2019m the parent of ADHD kids and a trip this long is hell on them. My kids could do 4 days max with grandparents they have known their whole lives. You also need to have the talk with your son about the likely hood of predators being people he knows. The whole request is off and maybe it\u2019s time to consider a formal custody agreement with stipulations that your son cannot be left with randos during your ex\u2019s time.

You need to put something in place to protect your son now, they\u2019re just testing the waters.", "Nta keep it simple. Too far away. [too long a time]. Have your son returned to you for the week.

It feels like a relationship that\u2019s once removed from them, even though you\u2019re totally right about you being his mom and wanting to know who he is around, I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily anything on their part that they haven\u2019t.\n\nAt any rate, trust you gut always.

Since you mentioned you\u2019ve been the only person taking care of your son, and his dad sees him only once in a while, he has to respect your decisions and boundaries regarding your son.

Your guts talking listen to it. And no, you aren't taking my kid hours away to stay with people I don't even know a little bit. What is a national emergency happens.  You won't even know who/where to look for.", "NTA\n\nWhat is your ex thinking? Take care of your kid.", "NTA. This sounds all kinds of sketchy. Maybe they are really nice people and they genuinely care for your son, but you don't know them, never met them, don't know their names. That's a quick and hard no, especially since no one saw fit to ask you about it first.  Add that to the fact the girlfriend has \"kept her distance\" from you. Too many things could happen and he's too far away from you.", "I'll probably get hate for this. \n\nYou lose the ability to police who your child is around on dads time once you divorce/separate.

The son I suppose he rarely sees during the school year. \n\nI would honestly talk to a lawyer about how to move forward. This situation can be avoided with a formal custody agreement. But maybe a lawyer would suggest that you start out by telling your ex no, and see how that goes. \n\nNo matter what I assume that you have the upper hand in this. The father moved away from his son, and you have been really agreeable whenever the father wanted to spend time with his son.", "YTA-Ask for their information and make sure they have yours in the case of an emergency. Is this ideal? No. But, this is being overblown. By you. Unless there is some concern about the types of people he hangs out with, then you are living the reality of both parents having equal rights to the decisions they make while the child is in their respective care. I bet your 9yo is super excited about this. Don\u2019t ruin it for him.", "Probably not a great idea but\u2026call the dad up and tell him you need the full names, address, phone numbers and birthdates for all of the adults who would be responsible for your son while he is in their care.  And tell him that you will be contacting the local Sheriff we\u2019re they live and if they pass a complete back ground check by the sheriffs office you MAY consider it.  \n\nIf he gives you any flack tell him he should have discussed this with you first before saying anything to your son.

They've spent the day with him and stuff, but that's very different than 24/7. He's not a super disruptive or hyperactive kid but he can be a big little boy to live with, if that makes sense. And the food stuff is concerning, you can't force him the way a lot of order folks believe when it comes to that, he will have panic attacks and shut down. And yea, different disciplinary styles, we don't use physical punishment, how are they going to deal with the inevitable things that you would have to address with a 9-year-old. And he just turned 9 yesterday. Like he's not almost 10 he's barely nine", "We haven't fought, he just got upset when I said I wasn't comfortable with it and and I'm really disappointed and upset they made all these plans without discussing it with me. I told him it's not a definite no, there's hopefully a solution in here somewhere. \n\nThey're also trying to do this in June which is very soon and apparently all made these plans months ago and just told me this weekend so that honestly was a big issue for me. I told him one of the things that would be Paramount in my decision making is that there is still time for them to make an effort to ease my fears. And it's not the gfs parents responsibility to just contact me out of the blue, I wish they hadn't reached out to get to know me a little bit but I do understand. I believe it's his responsibility to be facilitating some kind of introduction and relationship, and I think that's not super unreasonable?", "I agree that I don't get to meet everybody in his life, but I do think I get to know people he spends time with without a parent. I haven't pushed a relationship with his girlfriend because it's always been with Dad, but if he was spending extended periods of time with her alone I would expect to know het at least a little bit. \n\nWhy is he staying with the girlfriend's parents for the week? There would be no reason that he would be staying there instead of with me, I give up our summer time together gladly for him to be with his father, because I get to spend a lot of time with him otherwise. But when he's not with his dad I would be doing summer stuff with him. But I don't want to make the situation spiteful one where I say that he should be with me instead of them if it's something that would be good for him. I'm just really concerned that I don't know what kind of people they are, what they believe in, their value systems, how they treat or discipline children etc and then there is genuinely the fear of how far and isolated it is, that if anything were to happen how difficult it would be for me to get to him but also for him to get  medical resources beyond a general hospital.", "Ah, sanity, how I have missed you", "You need a custody agreement, even if just through mediation. Many of these agreements include right of first refusal, i.e. if the parent will not be able to \"parent\" during their time, the other parent can claim that time back. They also often include who the child can stay with unsupervised, etc.", "My question is why does dad need to leave him alone with them for them to have fun? Why can't he stay the 2 weeks or the visit just be one week? NTA, I would be feeling the exact same way you are if I was in your situation.", "I completely understand your concerns here. Is there a way you could get theses peoples phone number and have some conversations with them. Perhaps speaking with them will alleviate some of your concerns. If everything seems good, maybe let kiddo spend a few days with them alone. A week seems crazy.", ">I literally heard about it when my 9-year-old informed me that he will be staying there by himself over the summer.\n\nOkay sorry that's another red flag. Your ex is non-custodial, right? The non-custodial parent does not get to make unilateral decisions about where , and with whom, a child spends a WEEK without running it by (asking, actually) the custodial parent first. The fact that he hyped your kid up about it before telling you is straight up manipulative.", ">They made this decision and told my son, I literally heard about it when my 9-year-old informed me that he will be staying there by himself over the summer.\n\nI wonder if you could strike a more reasonable balance, like your son staying with them for a weekend. A weekend seems okay, but a week is just too long for a 9-year-old to go without a parent.", ">They made this decision and told my son, I literally heard about it when my 9-year-old informed me that he will be staying there by himself over the summer.\n\nholy hell, you weren't even *consulted* on this? it was just going to happen without your knowledge at all???\n\ngirl, get thee to a family mediator for *serious* custody agreement talks. this is bonkers.", "it's so alarming to me that all this has happened and you still somehow dont know their names? like, youve said your son knows them and likes them all so did he not at least tell you their names? how have their names remained secret throughout this entire back and forth? this can't continue another moment you have contact with ex/relatives and sounds patently absurd", "If there is some dialogue going then that\u2019s great!

Everything else can go on the back burner and be handled later (especially after tempers have had time to cool).\n\nYes, it sucks that the plans were made months before, and yes you should have been involved earlier. That definitely needs to be discussed, but can\u2019t be changed now.\n\nI\u2019m happy to admit that I don\u2019t know all the details here. From my outside perspective, focus on what needs to be done in the window of time. Get that information you need to have.\n\nOnce that is done, maybe it is time for you and your ex to sit down and re-evaluate the ground rules. Otherwise you might be heading in the direction of getting formal court orders in place, which might not make things easier on your son or the rest of you.\n\nI also want to extend my apologies for my original tone. I have lived through a lot of issues that rose from lack of communication, so seeing similar things come up brings out some frustration. That doesn\u2019t excuse my rudeness, though.\n\nBest of luck. It sounds like you are going in a good direction.", "1) Communication \n2) Set Expectations \n\nI\u2019d say first step is talk to your kid.
