Your sister needs to understand there are consequences to trashing the personal belongings of other people, even if they are family. \n\nI\u2019d die on this hill, OP - this is a fair price for an item and your friend\u2019s time. Your parents can decide how or if they choose to punish your sister, but you\u2019re an adult and have the privilege of deciding how much time to spend with her going forward of she continues to show this kind of disrespect.", "As for you asking for extra money for your friend. I totally see why you would. Your friend now has to spend her time/labor to make another robe. She wouldn't have to do that if your sister hadn't ruined the first one. It's a bit hard to ask for a set amount unless your friend has a set rate she uses for others. Beyond that, your sister (on her own without being told) should offer to compensate the friend for her time. But she's a B**** first for destroying your robe (and not telling you immediately) and now a bigger one for not understanding how she should be making up for it in every way possible.", "NTA though she is if she thinks a custom made satin robe would fit her at 6\" taller.", "INFO:\n\nYou say your parents made her pay but she won't pay the $50?\n\nSo has she payed or not?\n\nOn a side not the damage you described sounds far beyond accidental", "INFO\n\nIm confused, your parents made her pay? She gave you the money?", "NTA", "Slight NTA  \n\nMy mom sews professionally so I know how much work it takes, so I get it. But If your friend doesn\u2019t charge labor then you aren\u2019t owed it. She owes you the cost of replacement. Also you mentioned that you and your friend are owed another $50- why would you include yourself in that statement? You would be owed nothing other than a robe.", "NTA. Materials and labour. If your friend did it professionaly I'm sure she'd get more than $100 for one.", "EHS - your sister for obviously forcing herself into the robe and ruining it, and you for wanting her to pay double. She's already learning by paying for the replacement. You're not due anything extra.", "BOTH NTAH & TAH. NTA because she wore & ruined your robe, she has to replace it. It\u2019s normal to be upset about it. Probably more about her messing with your things in general that\u2019s keeping you mad. That\u2019s also very normal sibling behaviors. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth your relationship to stay mad, but asking for boundaries, maybe with your parents there to keep her honest, about what she can/can\u2019t wear of yours would be helpful.\n\nTAH because your wanting to PROFIT from this by making your sister pay double the amount. Your friend took the same amount of time to make the first robe & you didn\u2019t feel it was necessary for YOU to give her more money for her time when you were the one paying for it. You\u2019re getting the exact same thing back & she\u2019s paying for it, as she should, so why would you think it\u2019s ok to ask for more money? Especially asking for double the amount & saying you should get some of that money! You didn\u2019t do anything to earn any payment. It\u2019s all about being mad at her & knowing what will make her mad, like paying more & you getting some of that money! Take the win & get another robe with her money.", "KTA\nIt's absolutley fine that you made her pay for the robe.\nI think it's fair when your friend gets more money.\nBut I think it is hers to decide- not yours. Yes, you are mad at your sister but you can't make her pay more just because you want to punish her.  \nRather I think it would be fair to your friend to get more money from all of her friends, even though she doesn't insist on it. (Doesn't have to be double but just sth to thank her. Can also be a dinner invite or something)\nShe doesn't really has more work because of your sister when she \"does it all the time\" for friends.", "If you charge her more than you are paying for the robe Yta. Doesn\u2019t matter how much work your friend is putting into it because if it did your friend would charge you more. If you feel that your friend deserves more then take the 50 from sis and then you give your friend extra from your own pocket since you are the one that thinks she deserves more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is your friend being asked to compensate, with their time and energy and setting aside their other projects to do this one, for your sister's vandalism of your belongings.  Your parents ought to see that **your friend ought to be fairly compensated for fixing the problem your sister caused,** not just paid the Friend Rate.  Your sister's not your friend's friend.
