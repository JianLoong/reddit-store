I totally see why you would. Your friend now has to spend her time/labor to make another robe. She wouldn't have to do that if your sister hadn't ruined the first one. It's a bit hard to ask for a set amount unless your friend has a set rate she uses for others. Beyond that, your sister (on her own without being told) should offer to compensate the friend for her time.

Next time do $100 thats fair. And before anyone comes here and says i ldk what im talking about i had a samilar issue. My friend bought me a powerful af pc costing well over \u00a35k and all he asked for was \u00a3100 for building it. I was able to negotiate it down to \u00a350 because i kinda wanted to build it and he agreed. The issue came when my 12f sister came to my room in the evening while i was in a different country with some friends and decided to play roblox she then accidently in her words spilled her 2l bottle of pepsi ( dunno y she chose a 2l to a room full of electronics and alot of equipment) and it seeped into everything ( pc,3 moniters,xbox one, switch,ps5,keyboard,mouse,custom mousepad, custom led signs, led lights, 10 power extensions that connected to flood lights chargers and lots of other equipment) i came back to find that part of room just burnt didnt even get told about it till i confronted them. My sister said its not my fault you have expensive stuff which imo makes no sense as she was by the expensive stuff. My mum said i would make her psy for it but ik she cant even afford your leds sorry kiddo... i was pissed af luckily everything but the pc was insured which was a real pain. I asked my friend if he had reciepts to everything he bought for the pc he did so i asked for them collected them the next day. After collecting the reciepts i told my mum i have reciepts to everything from the pc and said either it gets replaced with same equipment or ill be suing sister for it+ 2 labour works ( when i first built it and when ill build it again) and emotional grief. My mum diddnt want me to sue but couldnt afford to buy or take out a \u00a35k loan. She replied how abiut this i buy you a \u00a3500 pc and you replace it with whats in the pc ( i was dumbfounded but not suprised when it comes to most electronics apart from a smart tv or an iphone she is really stupid. I told her nothing lived and its all fried she said hiw about we send it to the store to fix. I said it cant be fixed its fried and thats when she finally understood the only way to truly fix it would be to replace it. She told me to go ahead and sue so i did. I bought a lawyer that i only had to pay after the court case he said its a very easy slam dunk seeing i had reciepts as well as a camera in my room that records ( yes i had a security camera in my room you would to if you had stuff in there worth over 10k. In the end only 6 months we won because it was very obvious i was in the right and she was in the wrong ( the judge did say it was wrong that i sued family but said not to feel guilty as he wouldve done the same. And the lawyer only cost the 2x labour work so i left the court with a new pc to build ( super glad about) as well as a few grand which i invested and its doing great", "Nta is your sister a samsquanch?", "Yeah I mean, I would def lock all my stuff up in my room and deny sister access as well as not trust her for a while. It seems really deliberate and like maybe she was jealous? Parents should talk to her and see what was going on for her to behave like that.", "I could see the attached gloves but the hood? I'm 6ft tall and have worn things too short for me and have NEVER torn a hood off an item.\n\nPlus, did the parents just skate over the fact sister wore something probably without permission?", "I agree.   The sister, or whoever did the damage was malicious.   \n\nOP is NTA", "i am also about 6 ft and if i had to guess i\u2019d say she put the hood on, put the attached gloves on and just. pushed her hands down until everything broke. and i only say that because the fabric was stretched out, otherwise i\u2019d guess she just sat on the floor like a gremlin and ripped it by hand.", "I think you're underestimating your skill level. It would take me significantly longer plus a lot of bleeding, procrastination, and tears. Satin is hard! However, I expect OP's friend is also very skilled. More skill usually means a higher wage though, not less.", "Possibly, but $50 is too low for even a couple hours of skilled labor.", "Use a little spray starch with satin.  It will help your machine hold onto the fabric and make it easier to match up and pin in place.\n\nAfter you wash it out, press the wrong side of the fabric on low heat to make sure you preserve the texture you want on the right side while getting rid of any wrinkles.  If your fabric is very delicate, use a pad of flannel between the iron and the fabric for particularly gentle heat.\n\nSatin is tricky.  Once you know the tricks, it's easier to sew than a knit fabric any day of the week."]}
