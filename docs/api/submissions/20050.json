Just leave them both alone.", "Just my opinion here, I\u2019ve no experience with anything like this so it\u2019s probably all rubbish.\n\nI would start by making voluntary significant financial payments to the mother every month - whatever you can afford, let her know you\u2019re also putting money in an child ISA in his name, or ask the mother if she\u2019s already got an ISA for him you can make payments into for his future. \n\nAlso send extra monies for Xmas / Birthdays \n\nOnce you\u2019ve re-established payments for a longer period and have been consistent then ask the mother what she thinks is best for her child and roll with whatever she says. \n\nIf it\u2019s no then it\u2019s a no, but carry the payments. Just because your not in his life doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do the right thing and make his fatherless life somewhat more comfortable and help set him up a little. \n\nKey to this is to never let the child know what financial contributions you will be making / have ever made - if the mother wants to let him know that\u2019s her choice.

It\u2019s a big thing to walk out on a child and give up your parental rights and not something you can ever really take back.
