Of course, YTA.", "YTA", "YTA  \nGet your life together and make a savings account for the kid's future, s/he might show up one day to meet you. It is the child choice now. Be a better man because you can't be a father for the kid now.", "More importantly,would this child want to \u201c get to know \u201c you?  Youve been nothing more than a sperm donor.", "Yta.  Now that you have no responsibilities (child support, etc) you want to reconnect?  You've not really grown at all have you?  Leave this poor child alone.", "As a bio dad who had no contact with his son, though I paid child support for 18 years, you're out. Your only option here is to wait to see if he ever reaches out to you. Otherwise, you're just another disruptive force. My son reached out to me (at about 30) and we're great friends now. He even moved from out of state to live near us. He agreed I made the right call by staying away.", "YTA, yeah. Leave the kid and his mom alone. If, sometime later, the kid wants to get to know your or mom wants you in her kid's life, they can reach out to you.", "YTA and selfish. Stay away from that child. You didn\u2019t want parental obligations but NOW you want to reconnect?!? That child deserves better than you!", "You brought a child into this world and left it with one parent. The second you made the choice not to be in his life, you lost the privilege of him being in yours", "There's nothing like enough info to judge you one way or another, so I'll leave that well alone, but don't give up entirely on reconnecting. \n\nI'm the kid in this position. My bio dad bailed when mum was 7 months in and never paid a dime. Later I got adopted by my dad dad and as part of that, they had to get bio to agree to waive rights. He's been in my life ever since and I still see him a few times a year. He isn't who he was when all that junk went down.\n\nThe important thing here is he's never tried to take on that parent role and he has always let me set the limits on the relationship. He always went via my mum (until I was old enough for that to become inappropriate anyway). I think that's largely what made it work, and I'm glad it did. I know myself better for it. He was also adopted and retraced his mum when he was 40 and feels the same about understanding the self.\n\nIf you go for it, do it fucking right, but don't just write it off out of hand. It might be good for you both.", "Yta. You have signed away your rights. You have twice abandoned this child. You do not have any rights to be in the child's life anymore, you are not a father anymore but rather a sperm donor, a biological factor and nothing more. If the child chooses to find you in the future, that's their choice. But interference now would be unwelcome. You weren't willing to provide financial support to this child and you don't get a free pass to be around him now.", "YTA.  In the future if he wants to he can contact you.  His mother won\u2019t let you have access to him now regardless of your guilty conscience, so it\u2019s a moot point anyway.", "YTA. These are important formative years & this child if anything needs consistency. If you\u2019ve already made the decision that you can\u2019t be around then showing up unexplained is only going to cause emotional whiplash for this child which can cause a wide range of consequences for this child\u2019s mental health. IF you do decide that you\u2019re 100% committed & able to be back in your kids life in a consistent way, you\u2019ll need the support of the mom. She is in charge & I agree with other posters that even though you\u2019re not required to provide financial support, that\u2019s an important first step in proving you\u2019re stable enough for her to eventually consider allowing you back in. Actions speak louder than words.", "NtA. But maybe reconnect when he is an adult already. When he can choose for himself if he wants you in his life. Only at his terms. You are legally no longer connected to him.", "YTA. If you want to reconnect you should start by first paying child support. Make it clear that you want contact but know that that's not up to you. Then pay for your child and hope they will forgive you some day.", "Yta. \n\nYou were right to leave, you weren't ready at the time and you made a decision that you thought would harm the child less. You had a second chance to change your mind and get it together and again chose to not engage. You went as far as dissolving your parental rights so you wouldn't have to pay child support. Now suddenly you're interested in a relationship? \n\nPut together a document for the kid. Include your medical history. Include your family tree or ancestral roots if you know them. Include an email address he can reach out to on his time if he ever chooses to so you can answer any questions he might have. Then back off. Don't Include manipulative bs like \"I'd really like to get to know you, you'll always be my son, etc\".", "YWBTA, you waived your parental rights and the monetary support your child needed to grow up well. You literally put down on paper that you don't want to be your child's father, you don't get to come back in their lives now that you don't legally owe them anything.", "YTA LOL no way, you feel sooOOOoooOOooo sorry for yourself and would just annoy the hell out of this poor kid.", "NTA for wanting to, but definitely TH if you contact your child directly.  If you want, write a letter to your ex, explaining all about why you dumped them both and were completely absent from their lives until now.  Explain why you would like to be a part of your child's life and let your ex decide for herself if she wants that.  If it's a 'No,' then you need to respect that.  You could try again with your child when they become an adult, but that's up to you as well.  Don't be surprised if the door is slammed in your face.", "I had a similar situation with my son in a way. His family wasn\u2019t a fan of me and we had him when I was 17 so I ended up getting screwed out of any kind of rights. He\u2019s 14 now and reached out to me last year his self.\nSince then we\u2019ve started making it a point to do fun things together.\nIt\u2019s difficult connecting with a teen you barely know but it\u2019s 100% worth it. \nI\u2019ve even started getting birthday and Father\u2019s Day gifts from him, makes it feel like he really does appreciate the time we make for each other.\nAnyways, if you have the opportunity you should take it, not having him in my life made me super depressed for years and it\u2019s a huge weight off me to not feel that anymore.", "NTA for wanting to, but you seem confused, and if you aren't 100% sure you want to be all in, then don't. You have been the A H in everything else, it seems. Maybe someone else that could be a good male mentor will step up, and you should stay out of the way.", "This is the exact kind of \u201cparent\u201d OP is.", "Also kid is now 8, coming out of the kid stages into the teens. Also don\u2019t think that\u2019s a coincidence that mom did all the heavy lifting and now OP can saunter in for the hanging out stage.", "Indeed! We need those pieces of information \ud83d\udc46", "So do I.", "Happy cake day!", "'I am a total deadbeat and I am so selfish that, even though my approach to fatherhood is to just say that I am probably not suited to it, I think I own it to myself to jump into this kids life, fuck him up thoroughly by creating expectations that I have absolutely no intention to fullfil, because 'What if'?'\n\nStay the hell away from that child, you self centered asshole.", "my dude. get some therapy.", "Um, you would probably fuck with them more with emotional yo-yo if suddenly you want to be a dad but then in a year decide you don\u2019t want to be a dad.", "Step one, pay up on child support, with interest. Give your ex a reason to even consider letting you in their child\u2019s life. If you can\u2019t pay, then walk away. You don\u2019t get it both ways.", "LMFAO, your user name, OP \ud83d\ude02", "I literally said this? And am clearly saying he would have to reach out to his ex first. I'm not saying he should go and stalk a seven year old obviously.", "Wow. This, 1000%. Please take my poor man\u2019s gold. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nI was about to say that it\u2019s never to late to try to connect with a child. Then I read the post a little more carefully. And then this disgustingly petulant, immature response from OP. YTA, OP. Your shitty, \u201cFine, I won\u2019t\u201d just cements it. Hope the child and their mother stays far away from you.", "It\u2019s a special keyboard font. I don\u2019t have access to it on my phone, sadly.", "Sometimes the child thinks it\u2019s too late.", "And that\u2019s 1000% fair."]}
