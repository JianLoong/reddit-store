I live in a four bedroom home with my husband (41M), our two kids, \u201cEmily\u201d (9F) and \u201cRyan\u201d (7M), my sister (40F) and her daughter \u201cBianca\u201d (11F). My sister is currently 23 weeks pregnant with a baby boy that is due in early July. She found out that the baby was a boy about a month ago, and decided to tell us yesterday that the baby was a boy, by ordering a cake with blue insides that said \u201cBoy or Girl?\u201d for us to eat. The kids were watching in excitement, unable to contain their excitement for the big reveal. My son was on team boy, while my daughter and niece were on team girl. As I cut the cake, and the blue insides were revealed, my son started jumping up and down and cheering. My daughter said \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I will still love the baby!\u201d However, my niece appeared to be very upset that the baby was a boy, and not a girl, like she had hoped. When the two younger kids finished their cake and went off to do their own things, she stayed in the room with us and kept glaring at us like something was wrong. So, my husband asked her what was wrong, which she responded with \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a little brother. You know I really wanted a little sister and not an ugly stupid f***ing boy. I really hope the baby dies.\u201d I immediately jumped in and told her that not only is she not allowed to swear but that it was completely unacceptable to say such horrible things about her own brother just because she wanted a sister. I told her that what she said was rude, selfish and inconsiderate, that we raised her better than this, and to go to her room right now. She told me that I was the worst aunt ever before storming off to her room. After that, neither my husband nor my sister said anything to one another until about 5 minutes later, when my sister asked me to talk in private in the master bedroom. I went with her, for her to tell me that she agreed that what her daughter said was completely unacceptable, but that I shouldn\u2019t have sent her to her room because she was likely just sad that she didn\u2019t get what she hoped for and that she didn\u2019t mean what she said.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678500752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o80mc/aita_for_sending_my_niece_to_her_room/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is the dynamic here? Who's house is it? Where is nieces father? Some more context is needed here I feel.", "Idk what is the dynamic here but I don't think you should punish anybody's child except your's", "INFO - Are you in the habit of disciplining your niece? Do you co parent with your sister?", "NTA \n\nBut this seems like a cry for help. I think your sister needs to have a heart to heart with her to find out the real issue.", "I feel tempted to say you were right and wrong at the same time. While what she said was horrible and really needed to be disciplined or at least talked to about the situation, you said in the comments that you don't have the habit to discipline her, so I think it must have been a thing that her mom should have done.", "NTA and your sister seriously needs to step up and deal with her daughter now, before she has that baby and her precious little girl does something to hurt him. What she said is absolutely atrocious, and I would seriously be worried about the baby's safety around her.", "YTA. Gender reveal parties (so stupid!) have become a big deal in part because some people have very strong feelings and preferences about babies\u2019 genders. I have known actual adults who have burst into tears when they didn\u2019t get the gender news they were hoping for.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about a young girl who has never known her father, had her house burn down, resulting in living in someone else\u2019s house for 2 years (2 years? WTF?), whose mother is having another baby, with her boyfriend, so the new baby is going to have a father. And then she got the news that the baby is the \u201cwrong\u201d gender and watched people cheer about it. That\u2019s a lot of disruption and a lot for a kid to deal with.\n\nWouldn\u2018t it have been nice if, instead of responding to her words, you responded to the feelings and struggles that were probably behind them? Wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if *someone*   talked to the child about all those big feelings? Of course her words weren\u2019t appropriate and, of course, it would have been reasonable for her mom to talk to her about that. But do you really think that the best thing for the girl\u2019s growth into, eventually,  a mature adult who has the tools to handle difficult emotions appropriately was to punish this particular outburst? Because I sure don\u2019t. Parenting is playing a long game. And we all occasionally make less than optimal choices because we, too, have feelings that sometimes get the better of us. But being a good parent or pseudo-parent means reflecting on our actions and recognizing our mistakes, not doubling down and hoping the internet will tell us we weren\u2019t being an AH when we really kind of were.", "NTA.  I\u2019d like to point out that it sounds like Sister and Niece are living in OP\u2019s home.  Aside from what the niece said being out of line, OP has a right to what what goes on in her home. If she\u2019s letting people live with her, she gets to point out when something is wrong. And it sounds like OP reacted appropriately to niece\u2019s outburst since sister didn\u2019t do anything.", "Hell no, you aren't the asshole. You just parented when the parent didn't want to.\n\nI'm concerned as to why the niece is talking like that, but I'm even more concerned about the parents. If she's talking like that so young, where is she learning it?", "Holy trauma Batman. Niece\u2019s dad died before she was born. The house where she lived burned to the ground a few years ago. She then had to adjust and share space with your family. And finally a new baby from a no longer around mom\u2019s boyfriend is about to make an appearance. And she\u2019s 11 so in the height of puberty hormones and probably dealing with social drama at school typical of the age. I mean, I get what she said wasn\u2019t the best but let\u2019s put this in perspective - kid is just ready for things to be normal and easy for a while. Aunt blowing up at her isn\u2019t going to suddenly change her emotions, help her feel supported and safe or have her suddenly not say things you think are inappropriate. \n\nYTA - go apologize to her. And none of this \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u201d crap. Really own how shocked you were and acknowledge how you couldn\u2019t handle your own anger (hello pot? Meet kettle). Then apologize for dumping your anger on a CHILD", "NAH but I feel like a conversation would have fixed this more than sending her away did. The kid obviously has trouble with her emotions if she's so upset about the gender that she's wishing a baby would die, and just sending her away masks the problem rather than dealing with it head on.", "NAH. I don't blame you for taking corrective measures in the moment, even if you don't typically discipline your niece. This also took place in your own home, so you really weren't out of line. Your sister also isn't wrong for asking you not to do that again.", "NTA and your sis needs to step up. Kids need teaching not spoiling. She learned that being horrible has consequences. Just letting her be because she didn't get what she wanted is just going to encourage selfish bratty behaviour.", "Depends. If your sister is the type to ignore her daughter\u2019s bad behavior then definite NTA and her daughter needed to hear that. The cursing is one thing but wishing the kid dead. If she was 5 years old fine but not 11. Absolutely vile and unacceptable. \n\nHowever, if she\u2019s usually on top of things I would say NTA anyway bc I\u2019m sure you reacted out of shock, but not really your place.", "Ugh this is tough. The punishment is deserved but it should have been dealt with by your sister, whom unfortunately doesn\u2019t seem like she would have punished her. I\u2019ll go with NTA solely because the niece needed discipline which her mother wasn\u2019t going to do and the discipline was appropriate.", "I have to say that NTA. I am in the same situation. I live in a blended sorta family with my family also. And honey it still takes a village to raise a child. You in some way do help take care of your niece.  She lives with you and you do for her as you would your own child. If your sister was not around you would be the adult in charge. Letting her talk that way now will only let her believe that she can talk like that in the future.  Just like my brother or mother was to reprimand my children I'd step back. They did/said something wrong to deserve what is being said to them. I am sorry some parents would just let it slide. You do not apologize to a child who thinks it's okay to talk like they are grown too another adult. She is 11 a decade since her dad died and she knows right from wrong to know she can't say things like that. Sorry your house you have a right to send her to her room. You wouldn't want her speaking like that in front of the other children.", "YTA. She's not your child. Discipline is your sister's responsibility, and you should have left it to her.", "I'm going to have to go with a soft YTA, while your reaction was understandable you jumped into her mothers shoes and took over parenting her child. While you do share a home together as a familial unit your sister is still her mother and needs your support of her parenting even though she agreed with your stance.", "YTA. \n\n\nWhereas I truly appreciate that your heart is in the right place (and despite time-outs not being part of my parenting style), you overstepped.\n\n\nShe is not your daughter. You don't get to admonish her or discipline her - specially since her own mother was present. You need to step back and let your sister parent her own child. She clearly would have handled the situation differently and you stole that teaching moment from her. \n\n\nA good aunt would have waited to see how mum takes the lead and supported her in her parenting. It you disagreed with anything your sister could have done, you would always have time to discuss it with her in private later. Like she did.", "YTA. You're not her mother. It wasn't your call to punish her like that. It was up to her actual parent. Ya know, the one that was sitting right there? So, you need to apologize to your sister and your niece for overstepping your bounds.", "Not the asshole, what the niece said is completely unacceptable, good job on your part for actually doing something", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For me it really depends on the dynamic with your sister. I was raised by a very close \u2018village\u2019 - my mum and her siblings (spouses included) - all my cousins and I raised together, any parent could discipline any child, and any child could also depend on any parent.

I don't think it is necessarily wrong for another family member to correct certain behaviors - for instance you could have reprimanded your niece by saying something like we don't talk like that in this house or please don't curse. At the end of the day, your niece is not your child to parent. You weren't correcting a slight behavioral issue that any adult in charge (teacher or babysitter) would do.

You reacted without thinking in your emotional state, just like the child did. Why do you expect her to have better self control and emotional regulation than you have?\n\nYou completely shamed her instead of opening a conversation. And you reacted so quickly and so harshly that the child\u2019s own mother couldn\u2019t even get a word in.   \n\nThe poor girl has so much going on, this was a comment that should\u2019ve opened communication with the adults. Instead you just shut her down and punished her.", "Especially when their mother in there too", "The delivery was bad, they should not have yelled or insulted, they should've calmly said that's not ok, just sent her to her room and talked to her about it later. But she's 11 and saying \"fucking\" and the baby should die is not ok, even in my permissive family I would've gotten in big trouble for that. If it was a pregnancy announcement that would be one thing, but this is a gender reveal. She definitely does need therapy though.", "Right? I thought I was going crazy seeing the Yta replies. Was OP just supposed to let this little girl cuss and wish death on a baby? I understand this kid has been through a lot and definitely needs therapy but that does NOT excuse what the kid did."]}
