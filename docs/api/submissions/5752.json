My husband has worked 13 jobs in the 3 years and quits after 3-4 weeks(maybe) and has worked maybe 8months of the 3 years we've been together. This would be fine if he did any housework but he doesnt and i have to come home and do that AND take care of my daughter from a previous relationship. Recently (October 10th, 2022) he totaled my car that I had just gotten in June of this year and couldnt replace it. So it set me back financially a great deal. I was very angry and he has yet to get a job. He has caused me recently to lose government funding for my daughters schooling because his inability to find a job. Now with background information here is the story. \n    This year we  spent Christmas with my family this year. I have always been spoiled by my family as I am the youngest granddaughter, niece, etc...That being said my uncle decided to gift my husband and I 2K each as a Christmas gift. My husband wasnt present at the time so my uncle handed the 4K to me with a smile and a hug. Fast forward my husband arrives and we all eat, drink, and are merry. We are all in the car to head home. I realized i left my purse at homeand put the cash in thw glove compartment. He then asks what it is I am putting in the glove box. I tell him what it is and he gets excited saying he can finally buy his PS5. I start to laugh and he stares at me in confusion. He cant understand why I am laughing. I say because im keeping the whole thing. He gets angry and says why its for us both. I then explain why I am keeping it. I tell him that his portion will be used for bills and our kids schooling since i lost her school funding and that mine will be used for me. He then gets angrier and asks why do I get to keep mine. I reply and  say its because i have spent 3 years taking care of him and our kid its time for me to do something for myself. He then calls me a thief and while driving tries to reach for the glove compartment. He then swerves into another lane in front of a cop. We are of course pulled over and he is arrested for wreckless driving. Now here is where I MIGHT be the AH. He bail is set and the bail amount is $1.5K. His mom doesnt have it and she calls asking for his part of the 2K and I tell her no. His family has been calling me and threatening me. And telling me im horrible.

Take him off the list for your daughter's school. He is a biological stranger to your child and has no rights to her (at the moment. This could change if you get into a custody battle. Technically, he has standing because he's been in your daughter's life for so long).\n\nAfter you file for divorce:\n\nHave himself served in jail if you can afford to hire an attorney. If you can't afford it, you can still file Pro Se and hire a process server on your own. You may also be able to kick him while he's down and get him to sign a waiver of service from jail.
