His full name is Benjamin, now get over it.", "Wtf why wouldn\u2019t you name him benji then", "I... what??\n\nIs OP a teenager?\n\nImagine the DECADES of fighting OP will have to do  - teachers, friends of the kid's, doctors, dentists, barbers... future bfs/gfs of the son... \n\nI'm hearing Eminem's tune \"Will the real Benjamin please stand up\" and OP screeching loudly, \"hIs nAMe iS BeNJI\"", "You are really rude. YTA", "YTA. Everyone has already said it well enough but I figured you could just hear it one more time.", "YTA. What a weird thing to be upset about.", "YTA. It's his name. You're being unreasonable.", "YTA\n\nYou are risking loosing a friend because of a name you don't like. You are upset about the name so you will go off at the person who happens to say his full name. He is 18 months, he was having fun that's what you should of been focused on, not that your friend said his fun name while she was making him laugh and enjoy himself.\n\nYou need to talk to someone about this & hopefully work through it because this is his name.", "YTA.\n\nThis is stupid. You\u2019re being stupid.", "YTA.\n\nImagine being butt hurt that someone called the kid by his full name and not the nickname.\n\nIf his full name offends you, sort that out with your husband. Sheesh.", "YTA. She used his full name in the exact way most parents do. Nickname for fun and play, full name for \u201cyou\u2019re in trouble\u201d, even when it\u2019s just for fun. You shouldn\u2019t have agreed to a name you hate so much, but you do need to get over it. It\u2019s his NAME.\n\nBenji is a dog in a Disney movie. Benjamin is a way better name.", "My sister in law is the reverse of this - my nephew's name is Benjamin and she absolutely looses her shit if anyone calls him Benny...\nYTA", "So this person named Benjamin was special to your husband and died tragically. Now every time your husband hears you berate someone for calling your son Benjamin, he's going to feel sad instead of proud that he tried to honor a dear friend. And your son will get the idea his name - his NAME - is something bad. Grow up.", "YTA. You could have compromised and told your husband that Benjamin could be his middle name. This sounds more like a marriage problem and you are taking it out on your friend because of a name you aren\u2019t fond of. Your reasoning also sucks and you took it out on your friend. That friend of yours won\u2019t remain your friend if you keep this shit up.", "YTA. That\u2019s literally the name of your child, and you\u2019re getting salty at your friend for using his name? Grow up.", "What??!! YTA OP. \n\nThis is ridiculous! So you named your son Benjamin but are annoyed when people call him what you named him\u2026 someone is going to have to explain this to me. \ud83d\ude44", "Yea they could\u2019ve named their kid Benji as a tribute. Don\u2019t name your kid something you don\u2019t want to be your kid\u2019s name", "Me reading 99% of aita", "\"Why can't you just be normal for once?!\"\n\n*kid screaming in the background in the car*", "> Why name your kid Benjamin and then forbid people from calling him that?\n\nThe whole \"I got pressured into it by my husband\" argument is mad dumb. If it was that objectionable, you should have stood your ground harder, or re-evaluated the relationship before you two had a child.", "I'm old...Benji is a scruffy mutt", "Exactly! People can have a number of different names, depending on situation / social group (source: me). He might be Benjamin at work, Benji to Mum and Dad, Ben to his friends, and even something like Bam'in or whatever to really close childhood friends (weird nciknames are pretty common, especially for guys, where I grew up).\n\nAnd trying to dictate a nickname as 'the only name' won't ever work. Heck, my Mum's initials when she was born spelled a cute nickname that her Dad wanted to call her by - but literally no one ever actually did, not even him (as far as I'm aware).", "She chose the damn name she doesn\u2019t get to be mad someone is using the child own name", "My daughters name is Charlotte, and before she was born I had all these cutie nicknames picked out.  Nah, as soon as she could talk, my daughter informed us all her name as charLOTTE.  Well, there went any nicknames, but ya know what? Its my daughters name, she gets to set the rules.", "Exactly!", "I\u2019ve known a handful of Benjamin\u2019s. Almost all of them went by \u201cBen.\u201d A couple by \u201cBenny.\u201d", "Imo Benji is probably the worst short form for Benjamin (and my apologies for all the Benji's out there)", "I knew a guy from church who'd always been called Benji, and then suddenly it seemed everyone called him Benjamin or Ben. I think he was more like 16, but definitely had outgrown Benji.", "Benji is a movie about a dog I'm pretty sure", "I had a friend in high school we called \u201cbeen jamin\u2019!\u201d And his mom couldn\u2019t have stopped us if she wanted to.", "Same! Whenever I go out, the people always shout it.", "Omg now im imagining my Uncle Bill being called that as a baby. Idk if he was or not actually, mighta been confusing since my grandpa was also called Bill.", "You\u2019re not wrong", "Haha I love southerners mainly because I have a two name name (similar to Leigh Ann - the Ann is part of my name for real) and everyone else tries to shorten it to the first part only and I'm always like, MY NAME IS NOT LEIGH. IT'S LEIGH ANN. But southerners NEVER get it wrong. They always call me by my name correctly!", "I thought the daughter was like 10! That\u2019s so much worse \ud83e\udd23", "Thank youuuuu", "That's genius! They are getting jimbobbed first thing tomorrow morning \ud83e\udd23", "Same! I bought it on vhs years ago and showed it to my first grade class. They were riveted because it was something they hadn\u2019t seen before. They\u2019re all grown now, but I hope they remember Benji!", "If it makes you feel better, I'm 26 and immediately thought \"dog's name\" lol", "Dude the \u201cYTA, that\u2019s your grandlizard\u201d comment has me deceased. Thank you for posting.", "Oh wow, I was expecting the post about the grandlizard to be lighthearted and entertaining, but it ended up being surprisingly sad \ud83d\ude14"]}
