Naming him Benjamin is fine if he needs to for professional reasons later in life than just naming him Benji. He\u2019s your kid you can call him what you want as a nickname. He\u2019s only little if everyone else calls him one thing and one random person calls him something else he could get confused. If your friend you have advised several times only to call him Beji can\u2019t respect your wishes then it\u2019s probably best she left.\n\nAlso in relation to your edit a lot of people are named family names and then called something else in the family (like calling your kid John as their legal name and then everyone calling him Jack).", "So.. .wow.  YTA.  I can't believe this one.", "YTA\n\nHis name is Benjamin and that\u2019s what she called him. Just because you don\u2019t like the name you have given your own child you cannot stop people from calling him that.", "Easy YTA", "It\u2019s probably best you come to terms with the name you actually gave your kid, there\u2019s a good chance a lot of people are going to use it. Since that\u2019s his name and all. And way better than Benji the dog lol.\n\nYTA", "YTA. It's his name. Get used to people calling him that, or Ben, or Bennie, all his life. Or Scooter or Bam, or his last name. If it doesn't bother kiddo, let it go", "YTA if you didn't want him to get called by his full name then why did you not just call him that to begin with? We have a slightly similar situation with my daughter (think Georgina but we call her Georgie (not her real name)). The decision was based on the fact that we are aware that her nickname is like Marmite and when she grows up she may not like it and has other options (George, Gina etc). She's now in Nursery and gets her full name and she is happy with that; we still use her nickname at home; she's happy to go by both. \n\nYou get to choose the name that goes on the birth certificate. Not how they choose to use it the rest of their lives. You called him Benjamin, expect people to call him Benjamin.", "YTA. Benjamin, whether you like it or not, *is* his name. If you weren\u2019t that fond of it, why not compromise and use it as a middle name?", "YTA.", "INFO: What do you mean by \"referring to my son by full time\"?", "Yta look, his full name is his name. You want him called Benji, then name him Benji.  Every first meeting a school, after school program, etc he is going to be called Benjamin for at least thr first role call.", "YTA.\n\nYou named your kid and you're mad because someone is using it? Lol", "NTA\n\nNobody gets to do the parental full name thing that isn't the parent.   You've got the additional very valid issue that you don't like your child's full name.", "NTA it is strange that you don't want to use his actual name that you agreed to name him but you told her and she didn't listen. You may have come off as too hard but you're not wrong for correcting her", "YTA. Blame yourself for not just naming him the dog name, Benji", "YTA \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Info-Did you communicate to your friend why you didn\u2019t want her to call him by his full name?", "I've been told the story of my mom's best friend calling me by one of my name's shortened versions the first time she met me and my dad blew up at her saying \"that's not her name!\" Totally uncalled for, but they got over it. But to get mad when someone calls the kid by their actual name that the parents chose and is (probably) on the birth certificate...wtf??\n\nYTA", "He might at some point decide he only wants to be called Benjamin, how will OP deal with that?", "Shes still pissed her husband got his way with the name and is now lashing out at the friend. Its a marriage problem, not a friend problem.\n\nI repeat: this isnt about the iranian yoghurt!", "OP probably never heard of middle names. The first name is the name you like and the middle name is some traditional thing or something. If you don't want your child called that name but still wanna keep the tradition just do it that way. But now it's too late already, OP fucked up and now has to just live with it. YTA for choosing a name you don't like and then complaining about it.", "Sounds like the friend jokingly did it when the child did something that would normally be considered rude. Like when a parent drops your first and middle name to know you did something wrong. I call my 6 month old by her first and middle name when she decides to be an escape artist, of course I'm not mad at her crawling away and giggling.", "That\u2019s what I want to know too! As he grow up he may prefer his full name either just professionally or full time, or he may prefer a different abbreviation of his name. Imagine how she\u2019d react if she goes to some public ceremony celebrating him (say an award ceremony or his wedding) and they announce him by his full name!\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s his name. My dad was called Davey by his family growing up. These days he tolerates it from the few remaining family members who call him that and everyone else calls him Dave. My brother on the other hand (also David) informed everyone at the ripe age of three that his name was NOT Davey. The family call him David and everyone calls him Dave.", "my friends call me by a fake elongated version of my first name when I say something ridiculous because it's funny, I can only imagine that's what OP's sister was doing", "Yep!  I knew a guy whose parents did not want people calling him Charles.  So they explicitly, legally named him Charlie.  That was always an option, OP.", "Benji is a dog.  I have a son named Benjamin and we always called him Ben.  He's 46 now.", "My BIL is Brad. Not Bradley, just Brad.", "Yesss, another guy who sees this as a dog name.  I'm actually amazed,  I thought Benji was a dog name everywhere.", "Oh! I just commented above that OP is clearly too young to remember Benji the dog!", "OP is clearly not old enough to remember Benji the dog! Benji was the *last* thing you wanted your baby named back in the day! Lol", "Ngl, while I go by Iggy, it makes me feel pretty proud when my sister calls me Ignius in moments when she's exasperated with me.", "Parents often say \"my child\" when talking about their kids. It's not a red flag for someone to say \"my son\" when talking about their son \ud83e\udd23", "They'll call him whatever name he chooses to go by. If the parents say \"He goes by Benji\" that's what they'll call him. Like people called Samantha but go by Sam. Or Michael who goes by Mike.", "Your last comment made me laugh so hard! My mom used to do that too.. she\u2019d say\u201dI\u2019ll get to the right one eventually!!!\u201d  Or..\u201dyou know who you are!!!\u2026 Happy memories!", "HO boy, I'm glad someone else pointed this out.  In my neck of the woods, Benji is 100% a dog name and calling a human that might cause a few little problems.", "How is it valid that she doesn't like his name but chose to name him that? She set herself up for failure then", "Except teachers, doctors, literally anyone and everyone because that's his fucking name until he develops his own preference", "Tone might have played a role here but I absolutely understand why your father would have reacted like this. It's disrespectful, IMO, to call people by nicknames without making sure they're okay with it first. Some people don't care. Some people get called nicknames their whole lives without having a choice.", "This is exactly how I interpreted it as well.  OP is a huge AH.  She hates the name Benjamin and is taking it out on everyone else.", "Spot on. Oop, there\u2019s another dog name", "> How is it valid that she doesn't like his name but chose to name him that?\n\nWhat does that have to do with anything?   Maybe she was bullied into it by her husband?", "What do you mean what does that have to do with everything? She's upset with her friend for a name she gave her son, what happens when it's a friend of the son or a classmate, or if he likes the name Benjamin", "A whole lot of speculation is needed for your justification here. OP is absolutely the asshole. YTA.", "You tell a person what name to address your child by, they don't address your child by that name, you correct them.  \n\nI don't care what the parent's preferred name it is, I don't care what the child's legal name is.   Neither of those have any bearing on the scenario.", "You can tell them that. But any sane person probably wouldn\u2019t interact with you again because you don\u2019t seem to understand basic reasoning or a rational line of thought."]}
