When we made our decision to hold a child-free wedding we knew that this meant that some people may not be able to go so when our families started to say that they couldn't come if there children weren't allowed due to lack of child care, my husband and I told them that we understood and would send pictures. \n\nMy parents even went so low as to threaten pulling their financial contribution if we didn't cave in. I was shocked and hurt but told them that at the end of the day it was their money and if they chose this route my husband and I would be forced to downsize and the people my parents especially wanted there would be the first on the chopping block and we would be sure to let them know why. \n\nMy husband and I seemed to be at a stalemate with our families for about a week before my parents came to us with an apology, along with a few other relatives and promised to look into other arrangements for child care. Fast forward to a week before the wedding my husband overheard his family talking about \"the plan\" of secretly bringing the children to the wedding in the attempt to pressure us on the spot the day of the wedding. \n\nWe were furious and in an act of passion my husband and I decided to elope and got married at the courthouse the next day, sending and posting pics while talking about how we \"just couldn't wait any longer.\" For years there was a bit of resentment on both sides but we were all slowly able to mend fences, especially after the birth of my daughter \"Elsie\" (3f). \n\nBack in October my cousin \"Wendy\" (37f) and her husband got married and stated that children were welcomed so my husband and I brought Elsie along. Despite having a nice time my husband and I couldn't help but feel an oddness with everyone at the event but thought it was just in our heads until this past Thanksgiving when I confronted my family about their odd treatment of me and my husband.\n\nMy cousin \"Brenda\" (26f) then said how everyone found it so hypocritical of my husband and I to bring our own child to Wendy's wedding when we explicitly forbade her and everyone else's kids from coming to ours, and even eloped to spite our families over it.

Two different weddings, two different sets of rules.  You followed your cousin's rules.  Children were welcome?  You brought yours.  Your wedding was child free?  That's your rule to set.

Weddings are a family event and you were extremely hostile to the younger members of your respective families. And you clearly lack the humility to admit that you didn't understand before you became parents that bringing your child might actually be nice or important. You absolutely behaved in a very spiteful and immature way about your child free wedding, and it was almost certainly very hurtful to many of your family members. Children are people too. Children are part of your family too. They don't have to be part of everything, but you don't get to ban an entire category of person and then act shocked that people might hold it against you.", "NTA, but I have to ask, would you try to do a childfree wedding again?

I find it a bit saddening, but mainly because I think the real root issues that led to that trend have more to do with badly behaved or irresponsible adults than anything children themselves (but thats a whole other conversation)\n\nDeciding that the wedding needed to be downsized when the parents withdrew their finacial support is sensible, not selfish. Choosing to not go broke in that situation is neither preposterous or selfish.\n\nDeciding to drop people who were invitees of the parents first when needing to downsize? Maybe a little selfish. But the invite lists for parties are a little selfish to begin with. You invite the people you want to be there, and there's always a heirarchy. And no matter how much it may pain parents to hear this, their own friends are *low priority* for the invite list of their adult children. They should be some of the first ones to go when cutbacks have to be made.\n\nDeciding to elope when finding out about the sabotage plan and not telling/inviting anyone? Was it the best way to handle it? Maybe not. However, OP and her husband were dealing with family who were repeatedly telling them that their own wants for the wedding were meaningless. People who displayed so little respect for the couple that they could have nicknamed themselves Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nThere was little point to calling them out. They'd already shown that they were willing to spout baldfaced lies. I doubt disinviting the offenders would have helped any, considering their plan to just snowplow their children in.\n\nThe only thing I can agree is that there was a fiasco involving OPs wedding. But the blame is solely with the rest of the family.\n\nAs for the recent wedding, there was no hypocracy on the part of OP and her husband at all. Just because someone doesn't want children at their own wedding does not mean that they must forever more leave their children home from other peoples weddings.\n\nAnd if bringing their kid is a reminder to others of that past history, it should be a reminder of how the rest of the family acted in a low and shameful fashion and only that.", "I see a kid flying through the air.", "INCONCEIVABLE!!!", "I see what you did there \ud83e\udd23", "THE WEDDING IS CHILD FREE PERIOD", "The way they handled it", "Lmaooo how did they handle it badly?

NTA.  Mazel tov to you on the little one, and to the happy couple on their nuptials.", "I can easily see your family\u2019s issue with you. You were adamant about a child free wedding, and yet given the chance, you had no issue bringing your own child to a wedding. Your family is wondering why the hell was it so hard for you to grant them the same curiosity? Why cause drama infinitely greater than any child could achieve? \n\nYTA, in my opinion. I think anyone who\u2019s willing to exclude family from their wedding simply because those family members are under the age of 18 are assholes", "YTA. Weddings are not simply grown up parties.", "NTA.  Your wedding was child free.  Your cousin's wedding was not.  You and your husband have already been punished once by the family with their planned sabotage.  They need to get over it already.", "NTA", "NTA. Children were invited to your cousin's wedding.  You and your husband eloped  because your AH family brow beat you to the point your just gave up your wedding.  Had your cousin said no children you would have complied without a murmur.  That is difference in you and all the other AH relatives you have.", "Remember when you got C- grades for poor short story writing?... Believability is actually a thing....", "I had to reread this because in my eyes it would be hypocritical if Wendy's wedding was childfree abd you brought your kid, which the invitation you received said children welcome.... so I dont see the issue.  NTA some people like drama", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who also had a child free wedding, and who had a relative try the \"surprise! I brought my kids!\" move, I can assure you that if I'd caught wind of a plan like that from more people, I'd have eloped too. I wouldn't be shocked if the bitterness isn't that you brought your child or because of any supposed hypocrisy, but because you caught the family (likely Brenda was involved) in their little plot to upend your wedding and they didn't get to follow through. It's likely that in Brenda's mind, you should be facing some sort of consequences for not letting her and other family members surprise you with their kids on your wedding day. You're not, so she's pissy, and that's just tough for her.", "Some weddings specifically state that children are not allowed. If the invitation didn\u2019t have that explicit statement on it, it\u2019s assumed that they are allowed. If you brought your child to an event where they were specifically invited to not attend, then you would be the asshole. From what you said, that wasn\u2019t the case. NTA", "NTA - but your family sure seems to be. A child-free wedding is a child-free wedding. And a wedding that is not child-free is not child-free. There's no conflict here. You follow the rules and respected their wishes. And if their wedding was child-free you wouldn't bring your child. I just have such a hard time sometimes with people there so darn petty.", "NTA. Unpopular opinion but I don't think weddings are a good event for children especially if they are under 12. It's unfair to expect a young child to sit still for long periods of time without making noise or playing.", "NTA- If their whole thing is that people SHOULD have kids weddings, wouldn't you be TA if you DIDN'T bring your daughter when everyone else bought their kids, as if you were making a point 'decent people don't bring the kid along' style? I'm so sorry you had to ditch your planned wedding because they couldn't respect your right to decide as a couple what kind of day you wanted. Why they didn't work it out among them so they could have one solution for all the kids together is beyond me, it doesn't sound like they were all travelling a long way for the wedding. Wedding venues should cotton on to the money making potential of having separate childcare arrangements on-site but out of sight. We were on a ferry once that had a whole soft play, ball pits, slides, and a room full of Nintendos  (it was 1990), all supervised, we got one look and sped off going \"Byeeeeeeeeee\", you couldn't have prized us out of there for the wedding of a legit fairy queen to actual Superman, never mind an auntie.", "Exactly this. 5 years ago your family were so manipulative and frustrating to deal with you eloped rather than have your actual wedding day. They were going to bring uninvited guests to the wedding out of spite. They\u2019re just mad they didn\u2019t get their _gotcha_ moment bringing the kids to your wedding. Now they\u2019re looking for any excuse to bring it up and make you look like the bad guys again when you\u2019re just literally attending a wedding you were all invited to. Don\u2019t engage with it, they can stay mad and live in their own bitter weird world they\u2019ve created. \n\nSide note: I don\u2019t understand this rabid need of family/friends to enforce their will on a couple ***on their wedding day***. Just let them do what they want within reason, and stay in your lane. It\u2019s not hard", "They were right to elope.\nThe whole family is children. No other way to have a child free wedding.", "My friend had a \u201cchild free\u201d wedding, someone brought their baby and all you could hear was it crying all the time", "\u201cI wanted to yeet them out the window, but then realized I\u2019d have to clean up the glass, clean their wounds up, bathe them, and a bunch more bullshit, so we ordered pizza and watched a movie instead. \u201d - actual answer I gave my husband last week about an evening at home went with sick kids while he was away.", "As you wish.", "I have that game!\ud83d\ude05\n\n^^It's ^^not ^^good.", "And the whole \u201cshortage of perfect breasts in the world.\u201d\n\nThe whole damn movie is quotable.", "My father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man", "Did that once in the old school chat rooms with a friend who lives in Oz.
