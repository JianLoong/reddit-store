Weddings are a family event and you were extremely hostile to the younger members of your respective families. And you clearly lack the humility to admit that you didn't understand before you became parents that bringing your child might actually be nice or important. You absolutely behaved in a very spiteful and immature way about your child free wedding, and it was almost certainly very hurtful to many of your family members. Children are people too. Children are part of your family too. They don't have to be part of everything, but you don't get to ban an entire category of person and then act shocked that people might hold it against you.", "NTA, but I have to ask, would you try to do a childfree wedding again?

I find it a bit saddening, but mainly because I think the real root issues that led to that trend have more to do with badly behaved or irresponsible adults than anything children themselves (but thats a whole other conversation)\n\nDeciding that the wedding needed to be downsized when the parents withdrew their finacial support is sensible, not selfish. Choosing to not go broke in that situation is neither preposterous or selfish.\n\nDeciding to drop people who were invitees of the parents first when needing to downsize? Maybe a little selfish. But the invite lists for parties are a little selfish to begin with. You invite the people you want to be there, and there's always a heirarchy. And no matter how much it may pain parents to hear this, their own friends are *low priority* for the invite list of their adult children. They should be some of the first ones to go when cutbacks have to be made.\n\nDeciding to elope when finding out about the sabotage plan and not telling/inviting anyone? Was it the best way to handle it? Maybe not. However, OP and her husband were dealing with family who were repeatedly telling them that their own wants for the wedding were meaningless. People who displayed so little respect for the couple that they could have nicknamed themselves Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nThere was little point to calling them out. They'd already shown that they were willing to spout baldfaced lies. I doubt disinviting the offenders would have helped any, considering their plan to just snowplow their children in.\n\nThe only thing I can agree is that there was a fiasco involving OPs wedding. But the blame is solely with the rest of the family.\n\nAs for the recent wedding, there was no hypocracy on the part of OP and her husband at all. Just because someone doesn't want children at their own wedding does not mean that they must forever more leave their children home from other peoples weddings.\n\nAnd if bringing their kid is a reminder to others of that past history, it should be a reminder of how the rest of the family acted in a low and shameful fashion and only that.", "I see a kid flying through the air.", "INCONCEIVABLE!!!", "I see what you did there \ud83e\udd23", "THE WEDDING IS CHILD FREE PERIOD", "The way they handled it", "Lmaooo how did they handle it badly?

While I read it, it reminded me of the time when I was in Florence with college friends and one of them was quite authoritative on the menu because his family is Italian (American). The menus were all in Italian and we were chatting about what to order.  I said I wanted the caprese salad and somebody asked what that was and he described it as some dish that had meat in it.

The salad, plus my Tuscan soup, was fabulous, though.", "Thank you so much for sharing. That was hilarious \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23"]}
