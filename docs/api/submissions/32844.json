And he's adjusted to using right hand tools, so this might actually be dangerous for him at 81. Coming from a fellow lefthander here.", "I think that's fully up to your grandfather to decide, nobody else's opinion matters.\n\nGiven that his daughter has told you it could be painfully emotionally... what makes you think you know her own parent better than she does? That would be your cue to speak to your grandfather about his feelings prior to sending him a bunch of potientially emotionally painful items.\n\nI'll go with YTA, simply because you couldn't even take a single step back to think \"Hmm... maybe I should talk about this with the person first, and see how they feel about this history of theirs\". You decided it was a good idea, regardless of what people actually think or feel, and refused to aknowledge even the potential for harm.", "NAH - You mean well. However, your Grandfather is 81. He's had a chance to get himself left handed items if he wanted them. And your mum's point about dredging up old memories could also prove truthful too.", "NAH. You both make good points. Depending on your grandpa\u2019s feelings this could go a few ways. Hopefully, it\u2019ll be a lovely thoughtful gift you can bond over as lefties. Or it could end up opening up a can of emotional worms for him only he can say. Also, like your mom said it\u2019s possible he\u2019s completely adapted to right handed tools now and may not be able to use them well. \n\nMy husband is left handed dominant but was also forced as a kid to use his right hand and now can\u2019t write well with his left without practicing first. There\u2019s a lot of things he\u2019s just become accustomed to doing with his right that trying to rewrite his brain now wouldn\u2019t be worth the effort. However, your grandfather may see this as a nice gesture regardless. I\u2019m honestly curious how this turns out and hope you update us.", "NAH. It\u2019s difficult to know really, if you never knew he clearly adapted to use his right hand, later in life he could have reverted to left so did he ever properly learn to use his left hand? It was a thoughtful gift but your mother could have a point about dragging up the past.", "Tbh idk. The dude is 81 so why would he need tools anyways. Your mom is probably right. If anything ur the asshole but only slightly", "NAH - Your mom is either going out on a limb here or has more insight than you here. \n\nEither way youre not an AH for getting this gift.", "NTA, as someone who is left-handed, you know we are often forced to do or learn things the \"right-handed way.\" I think your grandfather would love to have the chance to do things in a more natural manner to him.", "Sounds like a thoughtful gift.  When your grandfather gets it,  and you explain its meaning and why you choose it,  he should be moved by it.", "NTA, but I think your mom might have a point -- my grandmother had the same experience as your grandfather and, though she eventually began writing with her left hand, she could never get used to left-handed scissors or left-handed golf clubs, for example. So he might not get a ton of use out of them, but I still think it's sweet.\n\nAnd it's nice of you to support the Leftorium.", "NTA.

If it upsets your grandpa, you can apologize, no need for your Mom to manage your relationships", "Nta you sound thoughtful", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. My Grandpa ( who I loved dearly) was left-handed when he wrote but ambidextrous for everything else and as a kid I was fascinated. I wasn\u2019t aware of how folks \u2018viewed\u2019 that until later but, thanks to his comment \u201cG-d gave me two hands to use, why wouldn\u2019t I use em\u201d .. so I did too. I now can do most things with both but, am still pre-dominantly right-handed. If you have that kind of relationship as well, that\u2019s up to Grandpa", "NTA. It might bring up bad memories but you got him a thoughtful gift. Your mom has no right to tell you whet you should and should not get people as gifts Unless you ask her advice. I do that (I am 18).", "NTA.  He may not be able to use them effectively, but he might enjoy trying them.  I'm left-handed and made it just under the wire for being allowed to use my left hand.  Most people your grandfathers age, in many cultures, experienced something similar.\n\nWhile I was allowed to use my left hand, there were no left-handed devices.  Using right-handed products with your left hand is incredibly frustrating.  I found that using left-handed products took some getting used to after decades of righty only tools , but the scissors are a godsend, as is the lefthanded tape measure, and others. \n\nAt 81, I  doubt he'll get trauma flashbacks. If that were true, I'd never be able to use a ruler, drumsticks, shoes, or whatever else they beat us with. \n\nIt'd be a thoughtful gift.  Worse case, he doesn't use them, and they can be donated to a younger lefty. Best case, he has fun with finally getting to use tools naturally.", "NTA. Your gift is a way of trying to bond with your grandfather because you are both members of the left-handed club. It\u2019s really sweet and I hope that he appreciates it as a gesture of affection.", "NTA but as someone who was raised like your grampa, he will never use the tools. He has been right handed his whole life now and it will be awkward for him to try to use left handed tools.", "NTA. I don't know if your grandfather would use them, since he's so used to the right-handed version, but who knows? Please let us know what happens. \n\nIncidentally, both my parents are left-handed. My mother (in her 70s) told her about going to *public* school (this was in California), and the teacher kept taking the pencil out of her left hand and putting it into her right. Finally my grandmother (her mom) went in and yelled at the school, and they stopped. My grandmother was a very controlling woman, so she must have really made her point!\n\nReally strange how crazy society can be. I'm sorry for all the people who especially suffered in religious communities like your grandpa's.", "NTAH!!!!!", "Did you happen to put something in there to explain the gift? I think it's a nice gesture and I'm guessing your gpa will take it as a special gift, however, without any context it might be strange. Does he know you know about his past?

That's how your grandfather will feel about using your tools.", "NAH. You obviously mean well but your mother is right that the gift might bring back bad memories for your grandfather. It's also unlikely he'll get much use out of the tools either way since he might have been left-handed originally but is now right-handed if that has been his dominant hand for over 70 years.", "NAH! My father is a little older than your grandfather, at 82, but he is left-handed but he writes right-handed. He hurt the ligaments in his left hand when he was little and learned to write with his right hand because the dominant hand was \"taped up\", his words. He uses his left to bat & play golf, but he throws with his right hand, he was a catcher. So yes it could trigger him, but it could also make things easier on him. You have great intentions. No matter what just tell him you love him!", "I\u2019m a natural lefty who was forced to switch to right handed as a child. (It was bad.) after a while, my brain made a kind of switch where I do most learned tasks such as writing eating or throwing right-handed but I still have the instinct to use my sinister hand more often. Trying to switch back in mid-life or later would not be so simple as picking up a pencil with my left hand. It would involve covering one eye, and a protocol for re-training myself that would likely be headache-inducing and what\u2019s the point? \n\nSharing this as a reference point", "Give it to him in person.

Even though it wasn\u2019t discouraged, as I never had access to them I learnt how to use scissors/sharpeners etc right handed and don\u2019t have the muscle memory for left handed ones. Your grandad is probably the same. So there might be more of a sting to the gift than you intended.", "NTA. Literally accepting your gramps for how he was born will almost always work out in the end.\n\nBurying and ignoring things is dumb. If this trauma was that significant, then your grandpa still occasionally thinks about it. The only people spared from not sending your gift is your mom in this case (if that).", "Soft YTA - I myself am left handed but I also do a lot of things right handed. I think the gift is sweet but would have checked with him if he is actually left-handed dominant or learned to use his right hand more. \n\nFor me left handed scissors and some tools never worked for me. It would be a gift while sweet that I would never use.", "I hate how badly we\u2019re discriminated against in daily life. EVERYTHING in this world is geared towards the right hand because that\u2019s what 90% of the planet is, sigh. \n\nThe death rate of lefties in the machine based industries is HIGH because the machines are built for righties. \n\nIn the early 1900s (he was born in 1899) grandad  - like so many here - had his left hand tied behind his back & was forced to learn to write with his right hand. Mom always said that as a result, his writing was terrible. \n\nI\u2019m pretty ambidextrous, simply because I didn\u2019t have a choice. When I was growing up, teachers/schools didn\u2019t give 2 shits if you were left handed & noooo privileges were given. I used to pray there\u2019d be *at least* one left handed chair in the room all throughout grade school, because it made my life so much easier. \n\nBut I still get it \u2026.. \u201cOh.

So far my mother thinks I'm making a mistake, but I think she's mostly pissed that I didn't go with her advice.", ">does your mom have a generally good/reasonably close relationship with her father?\n\nOf course I wasn't around to see how he was as a father, but from what I got, he's a more affectionate grandfather and has a different, warmer relationship with me and other grandchildren. \n\n>You say you just found out about him being left handed and having been abused in school. What was the context of you learning that?\n\nI think one of the reasons my mother was uncomfortable is because I learned about this history from her, not him. And it wasn't much about revealing he had been abused, it was about a random conversation about left-handed genes and how I'm the only one in my family; and then she mentioned my grandfather was also left-handed.", "Yeah. This is the thing. He's 81. He's been using his right hand a long time. Revelatory self-actualizing experience aside, why would he really need this? This seems pointless.", "Also natural left-handedness doesn't trump 60 years of practice. If he starts using his left hand now, he'll be at the same level as the first graders practicing with scissors.\n\nI'm left handed, I can't work a mouse with my left hand if my life depended on it.", "Would be interested to know about such 'cures'. Do you have any sources to read? :)", "IA. The tools are useless to him at this point. NAH.", "There's a wide range of left-handed people, though. I write left handed, but I do most things (including crocheting and using chopsticks) right-handed, because that's what's comfortable for me. I was sometimes given left-handed scissors as a child and it was easier to hold them upsidedown in my right hand.", "When my left-handed grandfather was in school as a child, he would have his left hand beaten with a ruler at the start of the day. The intention here was that his hand would be too painful and swollen to even consider picking a pencil up with. When he would still instinctively reach with his left hand, even if he caught himself, his beaten left hand would be tied behind his back so he could not use it. This was normal, accepted practice to 'correct' children using their sinister hands and falling victim to the devil.\n\nAs a left-handed grandchild, I very much understand your intentions here. However, there is also a chance that your gift may trigger some deeply unpleasant memories for your Grandfather. I don't think you are an AH, but I do think that you should prepare as much for a negative reaction as a positive one. Today my grandfather would love some left-handed tools, but 20ish years ago he couldn't bear to watch me writing homework with my left hand because of the memories and feelings it brought up for him.", "YTA- I don\u2019t know anyone of the 80 years old age range that was \u201callowed\u201d to be left-handed. Doesn\u2019t matter what community they were raised in. However, saying he was raised in a deeply religious community may have meant that he was beaten and severely abused until he \u201cused the correct hand\u201d. Your mother may know a lot more than you do about this. My FIL\u2019s left hand usage is not there anymore either bc he physically hasn\u2019t used the muscles in that hand the same way in at least 75-80 years, or maybe it\u2019s from the trauma he suffered to cure him of his \u201cevil\u201d. Instead of having an open discussion with your mother about why she might feel that way, you acted like you know better. You\u2019re arrogant and an AH. I hope your grandfather doesn\u2019t have a triggering reaction to your cruelty. But rest assured, if he does, you will probably never know, bc 80 year old men were also never allowed to show vulnerability either. Wtf!??", "NAH - It sounds like you have a pretty close relationship with your grandfather, and if he wanted to share this with you he would have. It is possible that your grandfather experienced other abuse at that school beyond being hit on the hand, and his feelings about all of it could be tied up together - further complicating this part of his past. I don't think what you did was terrible, and he may appreciate it. But I think you should have started with a conversation instead of jumping right to left handed gifts. Also, he may not even want/be able to do things left handed anymore. \n\nFor context on my opinion - my mom experienced the same thing your grandfather did. She has always talked openly about it, but she was pulled out of that school after just a couple of years.", "I'm a lefty, and grew up in a time and place where nobody cared. I still learned to use my right hand for certain tasks because so much equipment is just geared for right-handedness.\n\nSo personally I'd be a bit baffled being gifted a box of household supplies for lefties. But I could see it going either way, and I hope the grandfather gets good use out of it!", "My mom went to catholic school as a lefty. The nuns would hit her knuckles with a ruler to make her stop using her left hand. To this day, she swears she's right-handed, despite her handwriting being awful and almost unreadable. The only time she writes with her left is when shes tipsy, and she's got great, legible handwriting.\n\nThat was considered a \"cure\" back in the day.", "Striking the left hand so hard every time you attempt to use it, often until it bleeds, beatings, withholding food/affection/playtime.

Plenty of lefties in the nursing homes.", "Ok boomer", "So on one hand you claim of grandfather wanted him to know about him being left handed, he would have told him, but then excuse his callous insertion into a painful topic that his grandfather never shared with him.
