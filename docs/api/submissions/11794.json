Instead I recommend you go gray rock with her. When she says \"That can't be true\" respond with \"Okay\" and then change the subject to something simple - the weather, etc. In other words, have very basic, not in depth conversations. And remember, every time she contradicts you, say \"Okay\" and change the subject. If she refuses to allow the change of subject and goes back to the first discussion, it's totally okay to walk out. \n\nThat won't help you with the husband problem who doesn't have your back, but it may help dealing with his nasty mom a little easier.", "you cried because she scoffed at your answer. like you need thicker skin if a scoff makes you cry", "INFO: What were you talking about happening in Iceland?

Either way, I think he should have erred on the side of caution and spoken to you beforehand. \n\nHowever, it may well be that a cultural difference is contributing here, and I don\u2019t think anyone is a true AH yet. Your MIL\u2019s comment was not wildly rude or out of line. However, if they are a common occurrence, I can understand why you feel upset and unheard.\n\nCould she have been asking whether you have anxiety in order to better understand your reaction? Speaking as someone who also has anxiety, we can be sensitive folk! Ultimately, I think your husband needs to appreciate how you\u2019re feeling and recognise that MIL is making these snide comments too often. But might be something to think about all the same.", "YTA. Stop talking politics with people then getting upset to the point of shaking and crying just because people have a different opinion than you. You're not going to change their opinions. They won't change yours. Never talk religion or politics, basic etiquette.", "Don't talk politics with family. Don't actually be invested in the argument if you are talking politics.

He didn't know it upset you at the time. \n\nThe mother probably saw you being upset and asked if you have anxiety because honestly that's a fair enough question given your reaction to a minor disagreement about politics.\n\nIt could be a cultural difference and a time difference she probably isn't used to overly sensitive people.\n\n(She's allowed to disagree with you or think you're wrong it's pretty common in discussions)", "isn't knowing you have anxiety a good way for her to take it easier on you?

From the perspective of a lot of Europe, American perspectives can be utterly bizarre. This fixation some people have on being independent from your family and something only matters if you paid for it etc. It's surreal. As soon as you marry you're not suddenly only responsible to your new family, you're actually still part of your existing one etc etc\n\nBy sharing that you have anxiety, your husband is making it possible for his mother to understand you better and maybe be gentler when you disagree.\n\nI think re the Iceland 2008 thing you're just coming at it from different perspectives. My memory is that yes, there was a huge financial crisis and as a result the government resigned. It wasn't a revolution in the sense I'd immediately think of (as a European). \n\nYour poor husband is a bit stuck. Can you ask for his help understanding better?\n\nAlso, are you speaking the same language as his parents? Odd impressions can arise if someone is speaking a language they don't know very well. They can sound very different and it may cause confusion about what impression they're really trying to give.\n\nEdited to add: in the UK the statement that politicians are all corrupt is a right wing signal. It's used a lot to justify the appalling behaviour of our last PM who was deeply corrupt and dishonest. The Right often go \" Yes. He was corrupt, but then ALL POLITICIANS ARE CORRUPT so I may as well keep supporting the awful ones\". This despite the fact that all politicians are demonstrably not corrupt.

You don't need your husband for that. You can't expect your husband to stand up for you, you have to do that yourself.", "Yta. If someone can't even disagree with you without you crying then that's just manipulation. All she did was disagree with you. That's not inherently rude.

And no, being rude is not a cultural thing.", "ESH.\n\n1. Your husband need not necessarily defend you. You are an adult and you are capable of doing that on your own.

It is personal and he violated your privacy and medical confidentiality by disclosing that information to his mother without even consulting you.\n\n\n2. It is NEVER a good idea to discuss politics during family dinners. More often than not, this ends badly because people have different political opinions. In your case, there is a difference between cultures AND a generation gap between you and your MIL. It is okay and even expected to have different opinions. The polite thing to do here is to respect each other's opinions, try not to argue which one is better and keep disagreements to oneself instead of voicing them. You MIL definitely did not do that.\n\n3. If you feel that your MIL is disrespecting you, you should stand up to her and voice your concerns in a way that she can understand.

Stay in your room and watch something fun, go on social media, step out and window shop or get some coffee. Not all scenarios need to be solved, you can remove yourself from the situation and limit your exposure to her.\n\nMind you, your husband is wrong for point blank refusing to say anything to her about it.

I bring this up because my husband claims this issue is a cultural difference. \n\nRecently my husband\u2019s mother (69) has been coming once a month to stay with us because her parents are in a nursing home not too far away. I usually don\u2019t like to have too much contact with his parents because they occasionally make snide remarks to me. \n\nWe were discussing politics and I simply mentioned I don\u2019t have much trust in politicians because of numerous scandals that have happened. Husband\u2018s mom claims politicians don\u2019t want to harm us. Okay, that\u2019s fine. Her view. I simply mentioned afterwards that Iceland had a revolution in 2008 where they overthrew some of their government leaders and replaced some of them with women which was great. She audibly made a noise of disgust and told me if this even happened, it must have been a very long time ago. This happens often that she claims I\u2019m wrong, yet I actually am correct. However, this time I was taken aback by her rude gesture. I started to well up with tears because I felt attacked. I hid my face because I didn\u2019t want her to see, but my husband saw and didn\u2019t say anything. I eventually left and they continued talking. \n\nLater I told my husband it hurt me how she treated me. He acknowledges my feelings, but still won\u2019t say anything to her.

There is nothing wrong with crying as a response to feeling embarrassed, frustrated, humiliated, shut down, or any reason. \u201cToughen up\u201d is garbage. I was right in my other comment. You\u2019re an easy target. Much like me. Growing up in an abusive household really screws with your emotional output in situations that would seem like no big deal to others. I see you.", "Sorry to say but looks like you married into a emotionally abusive household as well.", "Why do you care so much?  If you know you're right and she's wrong then why even get upset or annoyed?  Just feel pity for her and move on.", "So where does he think the cultural misunderstanding is happening?\n\nRe Iceland, it might have been reported differently at the time. As I said, I don't remember it being described as a revolution. I think the government or protests were in 2009 and then we were all distracted by the Arab Spring, which was a very different kind of revolution.\n\nDo you know why she thought it hadn't happened? Did she deny anything had happened in Iceland or that it was a revolution or something else?\n\nI wonder if she's used to being the authority and she regarded what you were saying as a challenge and felt defensive? It doesn't make it okay but it might be something to bear in mind when you interact with her. You could see her as a research project and find out about her perspective without worrying about whether it agrees with yours?", "You may need a thicker skin for sure!\nBut what you are receiving as rudeness needs to stop. \nMake sure your anxiety isn\u2019t making you hyper-defensive first. \nAnd if it\u2019s not, there are techniques to shut people like this down. \nEx/ what did you mean by that remark?\nIs your throat ok? I thought I heard you make a noise with your throat. \n\nBut check in on your anxiety. I don\u2019t know how long you e lived there but you are far away from home", "She seems like one of those people that are so confident in what they're saying, even if not correct, that they get personally offended if anyone doesn't agree.\n\nHis mother disagreed and her reaction is to well up with tears?  Over the Icelandic 2008-2009 financial crisis?  Yikes.  Hard pass.", "If you say so. Don't agree, but okay.", "Tell her it\u2019s not her business is what I wanted. We are indeed family, but I am trying to set boundaries and not see them often. This situation is special since her parents are in the nursing home an hour away from us. She has the option to stay with her daughter who lives closer though lol. She makes comments about me and my daughter. Saying if I do something she deems wrong in a rude way. Example: I told my 2 year old at the time not to touch the furnace. She says oh it\u2019s not that big of a deal! in a nasty tone. Things like this happen often.", "It\u2019s true. They have a lot of issues just like my family and I get that. I just don\u2019t need the unnecessary comments.", "You\u2019re right I\u2019m going to try and change my ways. It doesn\u2019t matter. She can inform herself.", "He thinks Americans are very sensitive and I suppose I am. I will work on this now. His people are blunt and direct. I\u2019m not sure why she didn\u2019t think it happened but just said Iceland is such a tiny country it doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s just bad like Switzerland with the money laundering. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s used to being the authority since his dad kinda fills that role.", "Exactly. I don't doubt the mil was a bit rude or short but if this is a pattern with OP I don't blame the mil for not wanting to baby her anymore.", "If it's affecting your relationship with her, it's relevant information. I don't think its that surprising or awful that she asked, or that he answered.\n\nDoes you not seeing her mean that your husband isn't able to see his mum?", "A son isn't going to tell their mother that it's not their business. You're all family it's family business. Unless you explicitly say it's before hand not to say anything it's not at all unreasonable for him to answer the question.\n\nSeems like you both just don't get along have a discussion about this with your husband.", "But see that\u2019s the thing about abusive families. They never stop and they\u2019re just gonna keep going. Now they know that you have anxiety which means they\u2019re going to use that as a scapegoat to gaslight the hell out of you. Your husband isn\u2019t your protector here he\u2019s kind of a silent instigator. It\u2019s not cultural difference it\u2019s just them being cruel.\n\nHonestly, you need to have a come to Jesus moment with him. And if it doesn\u2019t change, you\u2019re gonna have to decide \u201cI want to stay in this and pray it gets better even though realistically, it\u2019s not going to\u2026\u201d or \u201cI wanna break the cycle of constantly having myself in these things. Today I choose myself.\u201d", "He\u2019s able to see her still, I\u2019m not forbidding that. I guess it\u2019s relevant, sure, but she can ask me and not him. She could have even tried to see if this was all a misunderstanding. She shouldn\u2019t ask him about my mental health imo.", "Yeah we don\u2019t get along - I definitely realized this, but I have told him not to mention my mental health before.", "I agree with the gaslighting.. ugh it\u2019s not a pleasant situation to be in. Thank you for your advice.", "I didn't suggest you forbade it. I'm asking if your attempts not to see her are affecting your husband's ability to see her (if the usual routine is she visits,  then cutting off those visits is preventing their main standard interaction. If the usual routineis that he goes to hers, then not visiting doesn't impact that greatly).\n\nI can see why she wouldn't be comfortable asking you. And I think it's beneficial that she knows. It's not like you were hiding it.", "You BOTH could have asked each other if there was a misunderstanding no?", "In that case then he shouldn't mention it but he was asked a direct question so pretty awkward for him.", "Just remember, you didn\u2019t go through all your struggles in life and survive what you survived in order to end up with a partner that doesn\u2019t love you enough to protect you. You did so in the hopes of finally gaining the peace and love you deserve so just keep that in mind.", "She also has the option to visit her daughter who actually lives closer but probably wants to spend time with her granddaughter which I understand. My husband doesn\u2019t want her around too much either, but goes along with things because he does what\u2019s expected of him I suppose. Because I specifically asked him not to talk to people about my anxiety, I feel he should have respected that. I think she dislikes me to begin with because of too many similar instances and yes, it\u2019s obvious that I have anxiety. I will set my boundaries I suppose and refrain from future conversations. All I can really do.", "Awkward or not- he's a big boy and can tell his mother either that it's none of her business.  Or that if she has question about OPs mental health- she should be asking OP, not him. It's not his information to discuss or share. \n\nThat is how you respect your wife's need that her mental health not be discussed with others. You tell them nothing."]}
