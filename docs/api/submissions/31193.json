Going out for lunch & working out together. We were never close when she first got married to my husband\u2019s youngest brother Sam(fake name; 29M). When Jane & Sam were dating, they were a pretty toxic couple, with crazy fights. Sam kind of gave her a bad rep, venting to his family &friends that she was crazy. They took a long break before they got married & Sam ended up dating his coworker Gwen(fake-name). Sam seemed genuinely happier,However Jane ended up coming back & making up with Sam. Sam never told Jane about dating Gwen. \n\nFast forward Sam and Jane are married but things get really bad & he starts hooking up with Gwen during this bad time. I don\u2019t know all details. I only found out cus I overheard Sam talking to my husband about it & when I confronted my husband, he came clean & told me everything. My husband said he already told Sam to figure out who the hell he wants to be with & make a decision. We don\u2019t know exactly when he ended things w/Gwen or if at all. But my husband just asked to promise to never tell Jane, which I did. \n\nJump 1 year later (June 2023), me & Jane start getting close, she was actually pretty chill & fun. One day while we were hanging out, she starts to vent to me about how she found some things that Sam was hiding & she feels like he might\u2019ve cheated on her. She asks me if I know anything from my husband & I say I don\u2019t remember. She starts to break down & say she has been feeling depressed lately because Sam got a gift from his coworker for his bday & that coworker was a female. They\u2019ve been getting into fights cus Sam kept the gift. She asks me again if I honestly don\u2019t know anything & starts to cry, so I freaking crack! I don\u2019t say a lot of details but just that he was dating his coworker before they got married & I know they were very close but don\u2019t know their exact relationship now. She\u2019s balling at this point & leaves. I get home & tell my husband what happened. He\u2019s mad at first but feels bad after I told him that Jane had a legit meltdown. \n\nA few hours later Sam calls my brother yelling & cussing at him, calling him a trader & me a snitch for betraying him like that. I guess Jane came home & confronted him & when he confessed, she went crazy, She cut up all of his clothes. My husband & Sam end up arguing & Sam says we\u2019re cut off . My husband being a bit  mad at me, said this was Sam\u2019s fault & he knew this would happen eventually& if Sam wants to cut us off for something he did, that\u2019s his problem. \n\nAs of now Sam & my husband don\u2019t talk, even Jane cut me off completely. Jane & Sam are still together from what I know. I don\u2019t regret telling Jane, just the whole outcome & ruining my husband\u2019s relationship with his brother.

I don't feel you said more than you had to, because you were in a very awkward position and under a lot of pressure.  \nMaybe your husband is better off without contact with a brother like Sam. It's too bad that Jane cut you off, but who knows what pressure she's under, and it's probably for the best. Both you and your husband should stay far away from that circus. It only entangles you in Sam's life \"dramas\".  \nSeems like your husband isn't loading blame on you, even though he's frustrated with the situation.", "This is unfortunate but you are NTA. You didn\u2019t even tell Jane that Sam cheated! You gave her some factual information that predates the conversation about cheating that you accidentally heard. Sam is the one blowing up his own relationships. I hope he matures someday and makes peace with your husband.", "NTA at all. The only person at fault is the cheating snake of a BIL\n\nI've been cheated on in a past relationship and the pain of that was difficult.  But the added humiliation of literally everyone knowing and not one person telling me was unbearable", "So let's see. You AND your husband knew a year ago that Sam was having an affair. Neither one of you do anything about it and let your SIL dangle out there with the whole world (except her) knowing about it. You then get closer to her and become friends, still without telling her. This isn't a problem for either of you two?\n\nYou can't see that as a friend she would start to confide in you? Why is she a friend? Because you TRIED to get closer to you. Now, when she confides in you, you are SURPRISED that she asks you about her husband acting weird, like maybe he's seeing another woman. And you are SURPRISED that she confides this in you and asks if you know anything about it? \n\nYou must be kidding me!!!!!", "NTA at all, Sam is a liar and the true asshole", "FAFO", "You're NTA. If Sam didn't want to get caught cheating he had some options: 1) don't cheat 2) don't tell anyone.\n\nHe failed to exercise those options. \n\n> I don\u2019t regret telling Jane, just the whole outcome & ruining my husband\u2019s relationship with his brother. \n\nThis is all on Sam. Not you.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who had a cheating spouse, I wish I\u2019d found out sooner. You saved her years of anxiety & grief and spared her from having kids with him.", "NTA. You wound up in a situation not of your making and have vague responses to you SIL. All the issues are Sam's and it sounds like your husband is just as fed up with him.", "NTA at all. The only person at fault is the cheating snake of a BIL\n\nI've been cheated on in a past relationship and the pain of that was difficult.  But the added humiliation of literally everyone knowing and not one person telling me was unbearable", "NTA. Jane might be either ashamed to face you. Or she might be knowing that she took the wrong decision of them staying together and doesn\u2019t know how to face you regarding that. Some people tend to respond like this.", "NTA\n\nTrust, the trash has taken itself out. \n\nSam isn\u2019t a good person but Jane choosing to stay with the cheater is mind boggling!", "You didn't ruin their relationship Sam ruined it with his actions.  He's pissed because he wanted to have his cake a d eat it too and he got BUSTED . Sadly you bring up front reminds me of this  Jersey shore episode. In the episode thus guy name Ron is doing this girl name Sam dirty . Sam asks her other roommates if Ron is playing her . Two female roommates write a note and tell Sam her suspicion is right.  Ron is dogging her . Sam gets mad at the two women who told her the truth and stays with Ron .... but yeah anyway totally NTA.", "ESH for hiding it from her for over a year.", "NTA", "NTA... good for you for telling her! She needed to know, especially if it could still be going on. If she chooses to stay with him, that's on her. If it were me, I'd want to know...", "Sounds like Jane is not crazy, just that Sam drives her crazy or he\u2019s just a straight up liar. \n\nBet Sam told Jane that YOURE the liar and the coworker meant nothing. \n\nNTA", "YTA.  How did you think that would work out?  You betrayed the trust of your spouse and drove a wedge between him and his brother.  You were most certainly between a rock and a hard spot, but seriously, what was the up side to telling Jane?", "You *promised* your husband to keep his secret.  You broke that promise.  That was a \u201cYTA\u201d thing to do without his agreement.", "YTA. I don't believe in cheating but I also don't believe in betraying someone's trust. Your BIL was having a private conversation with his brother ( your husband) that you overheard. Your husband then requested that you not share this information with anyone else. So you betrayed your husband trust. You were ok for an entire year not sharing this information that you shouldn't have known in the first place. It was only after you became closer to the SIL and she came to you crying that you told her. So please don't act like telling the truth a year later puts you on some kind of moral high ground. Did it ever occur to you that your SIL purposely got close to you to find out this information. She cut you off after you told her so to me it doesn't seem like a friend who was grateful to be told the truth by another friend. It seems like someone who played you until she got what she needed. Your BIL is a jerk for cheating on his wife, but that doesn't make you any less of an AH for sharing a secret that wasn't even told  to you. It was told to your husband.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I guess my worry is that my husband may resent me for what I did even tho it was Sam\u2019s fault but so far my husband says it\u2019s not my fault especially since Jane begged me instead of talking to Sam about it.", "Sorry I replied to the wrong person but I agree!", "I do agree that I shouldn\u2019t have broken my promise and that\u2019s probably my biggest regret out of this whole situation.", "If a person can't keep their own secret they really shouldn't be too surprised if other people cannot keep their secret. BIL has noone to blame but himself; if he wanted his affair to be kept private, he should have kept his mouth shut!  That said, there really is no virtue in violating someone's trust, and you did violate your husband's trust. You implied the affair without stating it.", "Sam already gave Jane a bad rap when they were first dating, establishing her as the crazy one who can't be believed. He was isolating her then and he's isolating her now, possibly he's behind her going no contacting you anymore. She might need a helping hand down the road. As far as Sam calling your hubs a traitor, wasn't Sam a traitor to his own wife?", "If he does... So you will know that your husband and his brother are the same.\n\nTreat him accordingly", "I'd say just take your husband's word for it that it's not your fault. You really were put in an impossible situation.  Hopefully you and your husband will be able to stay clear of Sam's and Jane's marital drama (or any other of their dramas). That would be the wisest course.  Best of luck to you!", "True but it is still due to Sam cheating.", "Yes I agree! I feel like had Sam not cheated at all or maybe chose the right person in the first place we would not be here."]}
