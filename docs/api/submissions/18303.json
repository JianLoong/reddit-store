We were also together for a while but broke off last year. This morning I found out that my brother and SIL are pregnant. They got married back in Feb, after knowing/dating for almost a year. Although surprised, I am really happy, and excited over the prospect of becoming an aunt. Although I was initially hesitant to speak of it to anyone among my friends as it's still way too early, my excitement got the better of me. I told my friend in question that i am gonna be an aunt soon, and let's just say he reacted very strangely. This conversation was over text. There was barely any positive reaction from his end. He told me that he doesn't like when people get pregnant immediately after their wedding (a common thing in our culture). I laughed and agreed because I share the same sentiment particularly if the couple had been in an arranged marraige. I told him that they have known each other for a year and my brother is approaching his thirties, so it seems like an appropriate time. He told me that it's not the age that matters, its about the duration you have known someone. He further went on to say that one should get to know someone for a while before \"humping the other person like a dog without protection\". I was shocked and speechless by the usage of his words. I told him I couldn't believe he would say that and that it was extremely disrespectful. He gave a half-ass apology (which I had demanded myself) but also kind of doubled down on what he said by making another joke. He said he had never been given a news such as that before so he doesn't know how one reacts in such situations. I mentioned that I regretted even thinking that I should share this with him. He told me that I was misconstruing his words, and he doesn't want to continue the discussion as it was of no use. Then he went offline. And just like that, all my excitement is gone. I am heartbroken over all of this and feel that him shutting me out even though I am the one hurt is so unfair (this happens often when we have disagreements). But this situation was different, I feel that he was just extremely disrespectful, and rude. \n\nRegardless, I want to have an outside perspective. So tell me reddit, am I taking a joke too harshly, and overreacting?", "created_utc": 1685187942, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t5aei/aita_for_being_upset_over_my_friends_strange/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do yourself a huge favour and lock it", "Nta I would stop being friends with him", "NTA, if someone says they're about to become an aunt you say congrats. It's not a complicated process, what he said was inappropriate.", "NTA your friend is immature, rude and vulgar. \n\u2018Congratulation\u2019 tell him this is pretty much how the rest of the world respond to those news.", "NTA His reaction is weird, rude, and inappropriate. Reconsider this friendship because he\u2019s not a good friend.", "Congratulations on becoming an auntie!\n\nI learned i was going to have a nephew after years of IVF struggles, and was so happy I started tearing up a bit in the car.

It sounds like your brother and SIL started dating around the time you became good friends with this guy. You mentioned dating him for a bit but you broke up. He is thinking if you didn't break up you could be pregnant with his child right now and he could be married to you. It's making him bitter.", "NTA, and that's not somebody I would want to be friends with.", "He was not joking. Most people would have acknowledged your happiness and made a positive response. His response was over the top, almost like he was trying to pick a fight.\n\nI am thrilled for you. My first niece was my special little person. We had so much fun together! Don't let your friend take away your excitement over the approaching birth. This is a wonderful event. NTA", "NTA you are allowed to be happy, and who cares when a baby comes. I know how I was raised you were encouraged to wait a year or two because you just moved in together. Finding a balance/boundaries in the house without tossing in a new human that could make things more difficult. Congratulations on being an aunty.", "NTA. it's basic human decency to be supportive of someone for such a special moment. what he said was absolutely nasty and uncalled for. i would cut off contact, because if he acts like this, who knows how he will react to different things in the future. congratulations on becoming an aunt, i know you'll be so loving to your niece or nephew!", "NTA.  He sounds like a jerk, honestly.  But also, honestly, you sound like you would need an apology for someone spilling water outside.  Letting him know what you thought is perfectly fine.  Feeling compelled to post on AITA for being hurt by this emotionally is over the top.  Distance yourself if you need to.  It happens all the time.", "NTA but unless given permission or said otherwise, you shouldn\u2019t be telling people about the pregnancy.", "NTA\nI have been an uncle since I was born,, it's overrated.", "Look. I am always a bit shocked if people get pregnant before say, 28 or 29, and really worried if they don't know each other well. It IS a recipe for trouble. Know what I do? Smile and say congrats! if the person speaking is happy, because otherwise you are an AH.\n\nYou did well to demand an apology. Nobody should talk about your siblings in that language. The fact he disconnected shows he's emotionally manipulating you, probably, especially if he does it a lot.

Being an aunt is awesome, speaking from experience! I have 5 niblings now and it never stops being amazing and exciting.", "YTA. I'm not gonna be as nice. You sure you're 22? Cuz you're acting like you're 16. Plus you demanded an apology? The only people who deserve a positive reaction to a pregnancy are the parents, not the aunts and uncles.", "The friend sounds like a jerk NTA", "Thank you! :')) This made me smile.", "It's got heavy bitter incel vibes, hasn't it?", "Ah without revealing too much all I'd say is that he was the one to break up citing family differences (his family would not approve us marrying) and marriage not being on the cards for him for at least a while. And yes you are right about the two events overlapping.", "This! I was thinking something like this too", "This is interesting. I would like you to elaborate on what action of mine screamed 16 yo? The way I see it is that if a very close friend of mine says something that deeply hurts me I would rather give them a chance to redeem themselves instead of shutting them out or not calling them out on it. The fact that they doubled down on it was what ticked me off. \n\n>The only people who deserve a positive reaction to a pregnancy are the parents, not the aunts and uncles.\n\nWhy, and why should I not be expecting a positive reaction from a friend?", "Nta. Any soon to be aunt/uncle/cousin/niece would be excited over this new. Her friend is bitter because he didn\u2019t get that chance with her", "Why and why? Because you aren't having a baby. Your sibling is. I'm not going to start making assumptions about the differences in generations, but holy fuck, do you make yours look shitty right now. Why do you deserve credit exactly, for your sibling getting knocked up?  Btw the action is trying to take credit for something that isn't really yours", "Do people not just...talk about stuff that excites them, in your world? It's just making conversation. Saying your sibling is going to have a kid is not taking credit for the kid, any more than saying there's a new Marvel movie out is claiming to have directed it yourself.", "Why would you assume that I am taking credit for any of it.. I simply shared a good news with a close friend. An unenthusiastic/underwhelming reaction would have been 100% fine by me! Theirs was straight up rude imo. \n\nFrom what it sounds like you just like to hate upon the younger generations, and are envious by the fact that we have set a higher standard for our relationships.", "Sorry that you came here for the general opinion of the public, and you didn't like mine \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBut also not sorry.", "Cause your opinion sucks ass.\n\nAre you never happy for when your family announces a pregnancy, do you just sit in the corner and pout or do you scold them to not do that again?", "My bad, if that is how I came across, I would understand if I look like a sore loser for not being able to take a joke. I would see that criticism as valid. However I am in no shape or form taking credit for someone getting knocked up here. That's all. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Except you're mad that your friend wasn't excited your SIBLING got knocked up?", "Umm no i was upset over them implying that my sibling were humping like dogs without protection...", "So then, why are you upset over your friend's reaction? Since technically, they really owe zero reaction to you yourself?", "Because it's rude to call someone's sibling an animal?", "No, you're right, he's a dick!", "INFO Is this a new internet friend?", "He did react strangely. But then I've never veen expected to congratulate someone for becoming an aunt before either, so that's also a bit strange.\n\nI'm going NTA on this one because even though letting him know is odd to begin with he could have feigned a quick polite congrats instead of going off on some tirade.", "NTA. The boy has some serious narcissism to think his views are infallible and must be accepted as the logical truth. And him shutting you off is another sign of \"I'm the superior here\" sentiment. His ego needs to be knocked down a peg or two. \n\nBut that's not your job. Your job is to turn up your excitement at becoming an aunt!", "NTA block dude and move on", "NTA. This is literally a situation you have no control over. His reaction is weird and out of line. He\u2019s upset about two people who have nothing to do with him having a kid. That\u2019s just out there and he has his own issues to work through. \nBut congratulations! You\u2019re going to have so much fun being an aunt!", "Where do you get the idea she doesn't have permission to talk about it?", "There are a million things you can say besides \"congratulations\" and a tirade, though. \"That's cool\" would have been fine.\n\n(When I was a kid, I used to get congratulated when my mom had babies! It's not that weird IMO to congratulate someone for becoming a sister or aunt or whatever. But his reaction was unhinged in any case.)", "She says that she was trying not to tell people, so we don\u2019t know if she did"]}
