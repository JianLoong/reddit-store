More like acquaintances that my mom and I have helped from time to time in the past. The people in question are an older couple, not sure how old but they must be at least 60+. They have a granddaughter I'll call Sarah 14F.\r  \n\r  \nTo give some background, We would lend money, and I would help Sarah with her school and study in my free time while juggling school, work, and my own issues I had going on at the time. Sarah's grandmother actually stopped those study sessions against my advice. Sarah needed those because she was basically mute and mentally underdeveloped and was performing poorly in school, but the grandmother never gave a good reason for stopping the sessions. One example is when Sarah turned 12 they wanted to get her a phone for school. At the time they found this other young girl to be \"friends\" with Sarah, I told them just get Sarah a phone that is reliable for communication, not a phone where she could have unsupervised access to the internet. Guess what? The girl used Sarah's new phone to show her explicit websites...they caught the two girls in a very compromising predicament before separating them. I had warned them about what would happen if they didn't listen to me.\r  \n\r  \nThe Background and context are important, to show how much we've struggled to help these people who ask for help and then actively undo all the work you just did. The reason for this post is this:\r  \n\r  \nThe grandmother stopped me one day and the first thing she told me was that Sarah was hurting herself. like...not a \"hello\" or \"how are you\".  I asked her to explain and she said rambled about how Sarah is harming herself, they've taken her to the doctor but she disagrees with what the doctor is telling her about Sarah's condition and diagnosis. \n\nAt that I got angry, I told her that it was not okay that this is happening. She's not medically trained in anything and doesn't know the first thing about mental illness. I told her that regardless of her opinion or how she feels, she needs to step up and get Sarah the care she needs. As is her fundamental human right, and I told her that she was not meeting Sarah's fundamental human rights and was being very neglectful. She started crying but I honestly didn't care or have any sympathy for her. All I cared about what Sarah.\r  \n\r  \nI asked her what did she expect me to do, and she asked for me to come over for a visit and to talk to Sarah. I asked her how is that supposed to help Sarah? I can only do so much and she needs professional help. I told her I would think about it and get back to her by Saturday. Well, Saturday has come and gone and I cannot bring myself to get involved again. I have my own issues. I just need to know if not helping this time around would make me the asshole?\n\nEdit: thanks for the replies, you guys have been awesome with your understanding and advice. I will keep my eye on the family from a distance for my own sanity but I will be getting authorities involved. I feel this will be my last chance to truly help Sarah.", "created_utc": 1687097310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14clefo/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_out_a_couple_and/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re right, it\u2019s out of your league but you most definitely need to make a child services report and if you get Sarah\u2019s side of the story you\u2019ll have more to tell the social worker.", "NTA\n\nUnless you have medical/psychological training, you should NOT get involved.

You don't have the knowledge and experience to give Sarah the help she needs. Sounds like granny doesn't know how serious the problem is here. Sadly, the only thing you can do right now to help Sarah is involving social services to get her the professional help she needs.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp them with a report to CPS.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhy do uneducated people always think they know a subject better than the experts?", "Yes, I was also thinking of it that way. It\u2019s almost like choosing the lesser of two evils though, if she stays with the grandparents who knows how she would end up? Although if child services gets involved and remove her then what? Would she be in a better position than her current one? It almost feels too much power left for one person\u2019s decision and i hate that it might be me. \n\n But regardless, I hear what you\u2019re saying. I definitely need to think on this more. A lot is riding on what comes next, this girl\u2019s life is practically in question.", "What good job? How exactly is berating this elderly woman and then walking away from the situation \"standing up for that girl\"? I understand OP's frustration in trying to help people who don't appreciate it, and obviously the grandparents are failing Sarah horribly. But OP did literally nothing useful except vent her feelings by scolding the grandmother. I won't call her an asshole for not wanting to help anymore, but she is hardly deserving of praise.", "Thank you, there\u2019s a small part of my brain that won\u2019t let me forget about this poor girl. I think I am going to try and speak to Sarah myself to let her know that she does have help outside of her grandparents. I think the older she gets the more she realizes they cannot be trusted for anything. Maybe I can take her out for a lunch or just do something nice for me, I still remember being her age and in a similar situation.", "This is another reason that I didn\u2019t want to get involved. With something serious, the way she described what Sarah had done to herself was horrible. That kind of issue cannot be solved or even helped with a friend just reaching out. I am going to make sure to keep my eye on them, even if I don\u2019t want to get involved personally..this is still a young girl who needs at least one person who truly cares. I\u2019ll make sure that she receives the medical care she needs any way I can without being bothered by the grandparents.", "CPS doesn't remove children from homes unless they believe there is an extreme risk to the child if they stay there. Most likely CPS will investigate and give the grandparents guidelines to follow and maybe scare them into following the medical advice they've already received.", "Interesting, tbh I\u2019m not fully educated on CPS and the procedures they follow. I know very little based off my own experience with them in the past. \n\n But that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always thought too, that these people are unfit to even care for themselves. They\u2019re are just too old and not able to care for children what I can see. I do have plans to involve authorities at some point but I don\u2019t want to rush to the phone without forming a plan and doing more research for Sarah. Thank you for the comment, this is going to help me.", "Challenge doesn't remove children unless absolutely necessary. They don't want more children going into an already full foster system. So if cps decides to remove this girl, don't feel bad about it. They are doing it for her benefit."]}
