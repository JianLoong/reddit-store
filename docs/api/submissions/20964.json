This is not a situation where the two families are having bbqs every weekend together.  It's not on OP to take on responsibility for housing three kids for a weekend.

I've been on both ends of out of state emergencies. \n\nUsually we've made the decision about what to do with kids once we've found out exactly what the emergency is and how serious it is.", "Exactly. And we\u2019re not taking about some small favor. Looking after 3 strange/unknown children for days? That\u2019s an unreasonable ask. I\u2019m happy to help neighbors and do - even the ones I don\u2019t know well. But I wouldn\u2019t watch their children for days so they could just take off to go out of state without having to pay for the labor of childcare. \n\nAlso what kind of crappy parent would want a stranger to have full access to their children for days on end while they themselves were so far away.

They did hence the emergency.", "I apologize, I was half asleep I will edit!", "Well that's a good reason for both to be gone and an even better one for you not to watch their kids and get dragged into their highly personal problems.
