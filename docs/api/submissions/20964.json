Her getting upset with you is weird and inappropriate. I wouldn\u2019t even feel comfortable acting like that about pet sitting, let alone three human children.", "You've had issues in the past with this neighbor.  You rose to the occasion when the kids messed up, and you took the high road.  Well done!  But that was for an hour or so.\n\nA whole weekend dedicated to watching the children of another couple, whom you're NOT friends with, and to whom you're not related?  Not your problem.  \n\nWell done in maintaining your boundaries.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat is way too much to ask from a neighbor, a weekend of free babysitting for three young boys who you barely know. You are not obligated to do such a big favor for her. \n\nAlso, the boys sitting on your patio for an hour is much different than living, eating, sleeping, bathing for a full weekend. You haven\u00b4t been around them enough to feel comfortable having them there with no parent like that.

Not even close.", "NTA\n\nYou're not obligated to look after anyone's kids other than your own.\n\nWhile it would have been a \"nice\" thing to do, you're not obligated to be nice either.\n\n~~Who is Jenny and why does her opinion matter?~~\n\nOK, Jenny won't let it go that you didn't do her a favor. You owe her nothing.", "NTA OP, this is the problem with parents these days because they would rather dump their own children on others instead of actually doing it themselves like they\u2019re suppose to be doing. I also hate how people like you & I are literally called \u201cSelfish\u201d or whatnot for choosing to not have children; like what\u2019s wrong with that???", "No. This has hinky written all over it. If for nothing else than the liabilities you mentioned. \n\nUnless you and Jenny were friends before this she had no right to get mad when you wouldn't watch her kids for an \"Emergency\"", "NTA\n\nHer wanting to leave her kids with an unvetted almost-stranger for a *weekend* is crazy behaviour. You would have been crazy to accept.\n\nHer behaviour is very weird.", "NTA. You may as well also have plans scheduled (taking it easy also falls under plans). She's hella entitled to expect you to forfeit your plans for the sake of hers.", "NTA, looking after the neighbours' kids an hour here and there is one thing but taking care of them for a weekend when you barely know the family? Absolutely not!", "NTA. Usually, friendly neighbors that you don\u2019t know too well are on the bottom of the list when it comes to emergency help / babysitters needed. Guess her other options fell through. It would be huge favor if you did but ultimately - not your kids, not your responsibility.", "NTA obviously. You\u2019re in no way responsible for her kids. Watching them for an hour while they are locked out of their house is totally different from babysitting for a whole weekend. Also, who leaves their kids with neighbors they barely know and had minor issues with in the past?", "Is it possible that the three kids didn't get locked out, that it was a test to see how you would react? You might have shooed them away, telling the neighbor that she can't exploit you for childcare in that weekend coming up.\n\nBut you allowed the boys to stay, so she felt free to impose on you.\n\nYes, people can forget their housekeys. Buty the timing is dodgy.\n\nI'm afraid she will try to throw her kids at you again. Better get ready to maintain your boundaries.\n\nNTA.", "Nta, leave the kids with a stranger for a few days? Jenny is nutty.", "NTA\n\nLeave my kids with some neighbour i barely know? Fuck no.", ">texted me if the kids could stay at our house for the weekend.\n\nWtf? I am always amazed by how parents think people will do these things. They sat on my porch once because they were locked out of their house doesn't turn into sure I will watch three young children for an entire weekend.

You don\u2019t know what those children\u2019s temperaments or possible issues are. This is not appropriate in any way.

Your fiance thinking that it was an even vaguely reasonable idea to take the kids for the weekend though raises some questions about his judgement.

They aren't newborns or toddlers.\n\nI have no problem with you saying no but to attribute the reason you said no to \"all the liabilities\" ... Come on. You said no because you didn't want to do it, you wouldn't have done it if she'd signed a waiver for all liabilities plus an agreement to reimburse any damage. Just be honest.", "NAH. But it is sad, I constantly see this stuff on reddit, what happened to just doing people favours because you CARE, because you want to help, because there's an emergency and this is just what happens in emergencies. I have seen a major increase in this attitude, whatever happened to being selfless now and again when there is something important happening? Doing things for others because you care about others? It just makes me sad to see the sense of community in society being lost more and more. When I was younger it was normal to get help from neighbours when needed and people were far happier to help out.", "i'm sure you're lovely but you could be a raging serial killer that does satanic rituals on ONLY kids and have an alter to Satan in the basement covered in squirrel skins and hobo fingers.\n\nNTA. watching the strangers kids next door for an hour or so is fine. but for a whole weekend? nope. what would happen if you are a fan of monster trucks and watch monster trucks on tv and the kids see it and now they love monster trucks but the stranger family next door are all prius owners and HATE monster trucks. now YOU are in trouble for teaching their kids bad things.\n\ni'm being ridiculous but, i'm really not. some parents are crazy and if you don't know them, it's best to treat them as crazy until you know for sure.", "Absolutely NTA. My neighbours nod politely, that is all they could expect. I believe if you help it\u2019s the start of a slippery slope of entitlement. Stay away from that rubbish", "NTA.

Liability is an important factor.  Kids can get hurt on your property, there's no guarantee the kids will listen to you, you have no legal rights if they need emergency medical attention, sets up the you did it before conversation etc.\n\nAnd how convenient is it that this out of state emergency occurred on a weekend.  If it was a family emergency the in law parent stays with the kids. Both parents don't need to be gone.", "Plenty of people would do it, there are plenty of people who genuinely care about others and want to help, especially in emergencies, there are people who will put their wants/convenience aside to help out. We have looked after neighbours kids before, given neighbours lifts, help, pet sitting etc when needed. I find it sad how someone can be amazed that someone would dare to ask for help from others, the assumption that it's shocking/unlikely that someone would care about or want to help another person.", "babysitting for this lady would definitely be a liability, she seems like an irresponsible and entitled mother. Kids of all ages can get hurt, make false accusations, hurt others etc. A lady who is trying to pawn her kids off on an unwilling neighbor isn\u2019t going to sign a waiver and OP wouldn\u2019t even be protected by such a thing. Taking in these kids who are practically strangers would be a huge liability.", "Why would OP do a favor to someone she is not friends with and feels entitled? People are sick of being taking advantage of crappy people and this neighbor is exhibiting a ton of red flags. OP owes this person nothing. The neighbor just wants free childcare with no pre-existing relationship which is incredibly rude. This pared with the fact she thinks it\u2019s ok to leave her children with an unwilling person she barely knows, super unsafe and irresponsible, why would OP want anything to do with someone like that? I don\u2019t understand how you think this behavior should entice OP to get involved.", "[deleted]", "Sorry but that is total bullshit and not the norm in any way. Most adults are around children often with no negative repercussions. It's very normal to look after other peoples kids, have kids round your house, be in the company of children etc. Those things have never happened to anyone I know."]}
