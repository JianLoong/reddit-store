Last week, she invited me over for lunch with her parents. Everything was going well, when she suddenly brought up her honeymoon.

My husband and I went to the Maldives on our honeymoon, and have been there a few times besides.\n\nNow that I think back on the conversation, she probably wanted me to back her up on how expensive it was. I interpreted it as she wanted more affordable options so she can still go. So instead, I was all \"yeah, the Maldives is expensive if you want to go to a 5 star resort, but there are more affordable options as well\" my aunt asked me to explain. I told her that I've stayed at nice guest houses on local islands with bikini beaches and a floating bar for about \u00a340 a night. And if a local island isn't your cup of tea, you can even look at 4 star resorts. You'd still be saving money compared to a 5 star one. \n\nI hadn't realised I upset my cousin until I got a message from her stating that she thought \"I'd have her back\" on this but I \"completely threw her under the bus\" \n\nIn summary, she wanted to go to a 5 star resort. She can't afford it so she wanted her parents to pay for it. She brought me in to convince her parents about how expensive the Maldives is so they'd be more convinced to help out. \n\nI tried to reason with her, but she's insistent she wants to go to an expensive resort or nothing at all. She also pointed out that my husband and I didn't stay at a guest house when we went for our honeymoon. Which is true, we stayed at a resort.  She's convinced that this makes me a hypocrite. \n\nAlso, she didn't tell me that the lunch was just a way for her to convince her parents to pay for her honeymoon.
