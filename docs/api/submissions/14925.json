We do ask for monetary help for emergencies and very very important things. 5 star honeymoon definitely doesn\u2019t make my list.", "NTA \n\nIf she wants you to take the lead, she has to tell you where she's going.", "NTA - as a Maldivian, I\u2019ve seen far too many tourists who have literally REMORTGAGED their houses just to stay on Conrad or Soneva, when you can get the exact same luxurious experiences on a \u20182 star\u2019 resort (a lower star resort in the Maldives is equivalent to a 4 star hotel in the UK, the beautiful beaches and the tourist huts are still beautiful and you are still getting a fantastic service for far less chances of breaking the bank) \n\nYou can definitely do the Maldives on a budget, and still have an incredible experience. Your cousin is being ridiculous. I\u2019ve been to many, many resorts growing up in the Maldives, and some of the best ones have been the very low budget ones - these also tend to have the best reefs and wildlife too! \n\nAlso, thank you for suggesting the guest houses and local islands - support local, everyone! I personally can\u2019t stand that my country has become a place where people just see it as a beach place, and nobody actually wants to see anything cultural or learn about the local life (I\u2019ve met people who genuinely thought nobody lived there at all and it was just for tourists) so I love hearing about people who\u2019ve gone to the local islands instead! A lot of those resorts are awful for the environment, and don\u2019t actually benefit the Maldivian population at all, as they are usually owned by non Maldivian companies and they now hire less and less Maldivians, so they don\u2019t even benefit us with jobs. Don\u2019t even get me started on the displacement of locals to build resorts, or the destruction of local islands by taking sand to build artificial islands to become new resorts\u2026\n\n(Please do not use this comment as an opportunity to ask me about where to go to in the Maldives or message me for travel tips, which seems to happen every time I post that I am Maldivian - my recommendation is always Baa Atoll, Aveyla Manta Village guesthouse on Dharavandhoo, it\u2019s next to Hanifaru Bay which has the worlds highest population of manta rays, and is close to the Reethi Beach (my favourite resort) and Royal Island resorts if you want a combo guesthouse and resort experience! Baa Atoll is great for scuba diving, and the resorts offer excursions to the coral reef gardens which are stunning. I have swum with wild dolphins, several species of turtle, manta rays, porpoises and there are occasional whale sharks there too, in that atoll, and there are also some rare seabird species that nest in the sandbanks too, for those into bird spotting)", "NTA. Wow your cousin sounds delusional AF. If she wanted whatever from you, she should have actually told you. This falls under \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes\"", "NTA. How could you have known she was attempting to use you to manipulate her parents when she didn't discuss it with you first? She is acting like an AH and a spoiled brat.", "NTA\nNote to readers... if you want someone to lie or sway someone you're going to have to clue them in beforehand.", " nta", "NTA if she had a scheme/hustle she wanted you to take part in, she needed to let you know.", "NTA - how much will the wedding cost?", "Or at the very least the cousin could give a heads up about her plan!   NTA.  Not a mind reader either.", "Very stupid indeed \ud83e\udd23 NTA, OP. So, she essentially ambushed you with this situation at what you thought was a casual lunch with family, and is now pissed because you aren't a mind-reader? I'm always dumbfounded by people who expect others to become \"yes men\" at the drop of a hat", "Where does she want her to lie? OP stayed at a 5 star resort for her honeymoon. The whole point is she DIDNT enjoy her honeymoon on a budget.", "This is ridiculous.  Don't worry about making up with her.  She was out of line.  She should be apologizing to you.", "NTA.\n\nYou had no idea what her plan was. If she was using you to get her parents on board with shelling out for her big-buck honeymoon, a quick meeting before lunch would have solved the problem. What are you? A mind reader?\n\nSounds like she was trying to manipulate people covertly and it blew up in her face.\n\nThe only difference between a 5-star and 4-star resort is probably the ability to say \"We stayed in a 5-star resort\". Which to some is apparently very very important...", "I hear all the comments saying that you shouldn\u2019t go on vacations you can\u2019t afford but I was really caught up on the fact that she wanted you to back her up but didn\u2019t tell you to??? Like thinking back to being a kid asking my sibling to cover for me, I\u2019d never expect them to just KNOW to do that lol", "NTA, and your cousin is an entitled, manipulative ass. You can tell her we all think so.\n\nYou will always need to be wary of her, and warn others as well. Someone new marries into the family? Warn them. Child getting old enough to be used as a babysitter? Warn them. \n\nYou don't have to tell her parents, though. They already know.", "NTA - Lets sing it together - Communication Breakdown \u266b \u266a \u266b", "It\u2019s usually helpful to inform your accomplice that they are your accomplice. NTA she never told you there was a plan", "NTA - she should have given you a heads up about really emphasizing the 5 star \u2b50\ufe0f resort.", "She should have also used her words to tell OP the plan before lunch rather than assume OP is a mind reader.\n\nPlus I don't know about you but guest house on a small island sounds a lot more intimate than some resort.but I have never been able to afford a trip to the Maldives and only have my cousins pictures to go off.\n\nAnyway NTA. She FAFO.", "Her mental gymnastics here should win her a medal. \n\nNTA, a lesson that will serve her well in marriage is communication is the key to a happy life", "NTA people have such high expectations for weddings and honeymoons because all the stuff they see online. Like be realistic, if you can\u2019t afford it then there\u2019s plenty of other places but also you don\u2019t have to go 5 star for it what matters is the experience with your partner.", "Same", "NTA she brought up the cost, you talked about the cost. The said it was expensive, you explained how she could make it cheaper. She DIDN\u2019T tell you to have her back, so you didn\u2019t have her back!! What\u2019s wrong with so many people expecting others to read their minds??", "NTA, if she\u2019s old enough to get married she\u2019s old enough to ask for what she wants like an adult", "NTA. i believe you were trying to be helpful. \n\n\u2026but it doesn\u2019t take a mind reader to know that someone doesn\u2019t want the hand-me-down version of your honeymoon. \u201cwe stayed in a resort, but you can stay in the \u201ccheap\u201d place we use for weekend getaways.\u201d\n\nyikes. that had to hurt.", "NTA lol how stupid is her train of thinking?", "If a married woman is looking for mommy and daddy to support her honeymoon, maybe she isn\u2019t ready to leave the nest. NTA", "Funny. She wanted help in milking the parents for money. Good thing you were obtuse. Do you really want to be close to this cousin?", "Also I might be just me but it\u2019s so sad that brides make the whole marriage/honeymoon about their own desire to be treated like a princess, seemingly with no thoughts about what the celebration even is about, and gosh, even that there\u2019s another person directly involved and interested in it."]}
