It originally was this gross washed out mint green with some white and my roots were showing, so I got something else. I\u2019m a hairdresser, and the bride and I are best friends (I\u2019m her man of honor). My hair is now purple and blue and pink.\n\nShe found out and was excited for me and then flipped her crap. She was calling everyone, appalled that I would do it so close to the wedding. My mom and her are close, so my mom stuck up for my decision saying it\u2019s just hair and everything. She then called the other bridesmaid and the grooms grandparents who were all extremely upset and even called the groom who compared it to wearing white on her wedding day. We decided it was okay, that everyone would sit down so no one would get distracted by me and I wouldn\u2019t be taking attention from the bride.\n\nWhat made me upset was I\u2019ve been helping her through this wedding and through the passing of her mom and she thought I was trying to sabotage her wedding and make it all about me. Since I\u2019m a hairdresser, and I color it way too often, I don\u2019t want to damage it even more. She even said to me that I need to change it, because her family is more traditional and conservative than mine, and having a gay man being man of honor is already borderline for her family.\n\nOne of the bridal party members a few days ago walked up and asked \u201cso what\u2019s going on with this?\u201d And messed with my hair. I tried explaining this to her but she ignored me and the bride needed her help. Grandma then went to the bride to help change and asked \u201cwhy did he do it before the wedding why couldn\u2019t he have done it after\u201d and \u201cis he still not changing it,\u201d etc.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of this judgement and everyone\u2019s thinking I\u2019m a bad guy.\n\nEdit: made things more vague.", "created_utc": 1667734942, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynnson/aita_for_changing_my_hair_color_before_a_wedding/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had to do SOMETHING with it, and you made sure it looked fresh for a formal event. \n\nDid she want you to come to her wedding with ugly faded color and roots? Wouldn't that have called just as much attention to you (and been worse for photos)?\n\nFeels like you're in a lose/lose situation here.", "NTA I will never understand the audacity of some people who think that because they're a bride, they get *complete* control over other people. Control over the colour scheme of the clothes worn by the wedding party is fine and understandable, but trying to control the colour scheme of PEOPLE'S HAIR is ridiculous.

You said you colour it often, would it have been a big deal to hold off?\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to expect you to dye it soon after just doing it if it's going to damage your hair, what's done is done there. But a bit of consideration beforehand wouldn't have gone amiss.", "Nta, just because there\u2019s a wedding it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not allowed to make changes about yourself even if it \u201cattracts attention on you\u201d \ud83d\udc80", " ESH. It sounds so vain but a big part of weddings are the photos, and a major change to your appearance will change the aesthetic because you are center stage. I specifically chose a cap sleeve dress for one of my bridesmaids to partially cover her tattoo. It\u2019s a beautiful piece and I love it, but it\u2019s bright and distracting and I didn\u2019t want it in the photo. That was my choice as the bride. I never up front told her that was the reason for the cut of her dress because I didn\u2019t want to sound like a dick, and she looked stunning in it anyhow. Then a week or two before my wedding she got a HUGE new piece that took up her entire arm. I was pretty annoyed. The new tat was a witchy tarot card thing with an enormous pentagram in the center and I was getting married in a CATHOLIC CHURCH. She offered to try to cover it with makeup and failed (she turned down using my MUA\u2019s airbrush and her attempt to cover it failed). So she walked as my bridesmaid even though she pissed off all the religious family members. Years later I\u2019m over it obviously, but she could\u2019ve waited a few weeks.\n\nSame situation here-your bride wasn\u2019t envisioning pink and purple hair in her photos (although mint green is not exactly a conservative color either). And such a bright and dramatic change would have been worth running by her. It wasn\u2019t a considerate thing to do\n\nBut her reaction is also over the top. What are you expected to do? Run out and immediately redye it? You made a mistake imo, but her response is too much", "ESH. I must first concede the point that the guilt tripping she used on you to sway you into changing your hair colour was uncalled for, and the childish assumption that you are trying to steal the limelight away from her.\n\nHowever, if her family and her feels uncomfortable about your hair colour on the day of the wedding, don\u2019t you think you could just get a coloured hair spray just for that day?", "Info: Have you asked her if she would have been fine with how it looked before or what her expectations were?", "YTA. Yes, its only hair and its your hair. But doing something like this right before a wedding, where you're basically #3 in the wedding was a bit selfish. And if your bride recommended something a bit conservative... Purple is not it. My hair is purple and black so I get it. But your mix is a bit out there. Conservative would have been like brown, or brown with highlights. You're definitely going to get more conversation than the bride. I understand her being upset.", "How about a wig?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Not a huge change.\n\nPersonally I\u2019d say NTA as the reality is that nobody outside the bride and groom honestly gives a shit about the wedding, it\u2019s a party, a chance to get together maybe, but it clearly means the world to the couple.", "Personally i dont think it would even matter if they changed it from their natural color.

She stated she has a traditional conservative family. She really didn\u2019t see this coming? I think it might be about more than the hair.", "Generally, I agree. But I think the fact that it's only a week before is important context. Technically they can do whatever they want with their hair, but there's a level of drama asking that comes with big changes like that. \n\n(I say, having my next appointment for purple and pink dye the day before an important holiday party. Of course I did that on purpose.)", "NTA-Your hair color isn\u2019t even a problem. Don\u2019t worry about the others. I think at the end of the day, everyone trying to hate on the hair is jealous they aren\u2019t as free to change their look because they unfortunately care what others think more than expressing themselves and being comfortable in their own skin.", "Please don't dye it again just to appease insecure people!

Anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with your hair, frankly I'm jealous! \n\nHer relatives are homophobic, and potentially think man dying their hair is perceived as \"too gay\" as some people can be ridiculous like that.\n\nUnfortunately some bigots are unveiled if they think someone else's appearance seems to indicate someone is comfortable expressing anything they perceive to be as \"other\", ie not the gender they were born as. They project their closed minded ideas of how others should look, and are offended if others do not comply. They're unimaginative, and probably a bit bitter because they feel they are constrained to dress a certain way. Their lives are much the sadder for living this way.\n\n\nFrankly, you deserve better. You seem thoughtful, and kind. Now extend the same kindness to yourself as you would to others in your shoes. You deserve to dye your hair whatever colours you want, and other people can bog off if they're so shallow and closed minded.\n\nI'm sorry your \"friend\" has revealed homophobia and/or narcissism over such a non issue. You deserve better.\n\nEdit: I also think \"friend\" doesn't want to row with homophobes on her wedding day, so rather than telling them to behave, she's trying to control the potential victim of their hate, which is pretty cowardly and disgusting.", "I see.

If she wanted it look a certain way she should have been more specific when first asked. NTA.", "Playing devil\u2019s advocate. Maybe other fantasy colors would work well. Maybe she assumed by colored they\u2019d be sticking with something like the mint green. Depending on the colors of the wedding maybe a fun fantasy color could work. But this specific combo I can imagine clashing with just about every wedding color palate I can imagine. To take one conversation from months ago and assume it meant you had no limits whatsoever is a mistake.\n\nI didn\u2019t really give my bridesmaids much guidance on their hair besides that it be down. They all chose to do their own hair which was fine. I gave permission to do their own thing but it was obviously within reason. One friend had colorful dyed hair but it was complementary to my wedding colors so it looked nice. If she showed up the day of the wedding with a highlighter green mohawk then we would\u2019ve had a problem. That shouldn\u2019t have to be stated. If you\u2019re doing something reallly out there it would be common courtesy to run it by her\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been through wedding planning I don\u2019t think you can fully appreciate the stress of wanting things to run smoothly. You\u2019re dropping tens of thousands of dollars sometimes just for one day. So you want that day to be as perfect as can be. And something like this causes major stress. Tack on that she lost her mom so that\u2019s already going to hang a cloud over her day (my brother died shortly before my wedding and there were lots of sad tears during toasts and stuff). She doesn\u2019t want one more thing going wrong. It wasn\u2019t done with malice clearly. But I think it should be easy to empathize about why she\u2019d be upset", "I just don\u2019t think someone\u2019s hair color is a reason to get bent out of shape, clashing or not. Playing devils advocate, myself, the bride obviously knew he liked to play around with fantasy colors. As someone who dyes my hair fantasy colors, I would expect my friends to know that next time I dye my hair, it could be literally anything. So my friends would know to be specific if they didn\u2019t want \u201ccrazy\u201d hair at their wedding. The bride, knowing he does fantasy colors and it\u2019s not always the same, should have been more specific if she wanted more traditional hair.", "It\u2019s just a communication issue all around. She said natural or dyed, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean traditional. I do think it\u2019s a valid reason to get upset honestly.\nI had a bridesmaid who gained some weight (not her fault and I\u2019m all about body positivity but stay with me) and the only way to adjust her dress to accommodate the extra breast tissue was so make it a lot lower. Her boobs were OUT. And to this day it\u2019s the main thing people talk about from my wedding. Remember her dress? Hahaha didn\u2019t know she got two plus ones! Etc etc \n\nYes they\u2019re just boobs. And honestly she looked amazing. But it did draw focus. Even during the ceremony my eyes drifted lol. Nothing to be done about it but you can\u2019t deny it was a distraction. People were gossiping during the reception and it comes up any time we go through bridal party photos \n\nEven if she herself was going to be fine with the hair color, she\u2019s going to have people in the audience just like her grandma who are in the back commenting about why the MOH\u2019s hair looks the way it does instead of about how beautiful the bride looks or how happy the groom looks. It\u2019s not selfish to want your wedding day focused on you. It\u2019s only one day.\n\nJust the forethought to clarify with each other could\u2019ve prevented the whole mess"]}
