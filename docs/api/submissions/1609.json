Since I\u2019m a hairdresser, and I color it way too often, I don\u2019t want to damage it even more. She even said to me that I need to change it, because her family is more traditional and conservative than mine, and having a gay man being man of honor is already borderline for her family.\n\nOne of the bridal party members a few days ago walked up and asked \u201cso what\u2019s going on with this?\u201d And messed with my hair.

It sounds so vain but a big part of weddings are the photos, and a major change to your appearance will change the aesthetic because you are center stage. I specifically chose a cap sleeve dress for one of my bridesmaids to partially cover her tattoo. It\u2019s a beautiful piece and I love it, but it\u2019s bright and distracting and I didn\u2019t want it in the photo. That was my choice as the bride. I never up front told her that was the reason for the cut of her dress because I didn\u2019t want to sound like a dick, and she looked stunning in it anyhow. Then a week or two before my wedding she got a HUGE new piece that took up her entire arm. I was pretty annoyed. The new tat was a witchy tarot card thing with an enormous pentagram in the center and I was getting married in a CATHOLIC CHURCH. She offered to try to cover it with makeup and failed (she turned down using my MUA\u2019s airbrush and her attempt to cover it failed). So she walked as my bridesmaid even though she pissed off all the religious family members. Years later I\u2019m over it obviously, but she could\u2019ve waited a few weeks.\n\nSame situation here-your bride wasn\u2019t envisioning pink and purple hair in her photos (although mint green is not exactly a conservative color either). And such a bright and dramatic change would have been worth running by her. It wasn\u2019t a considerate thing to do\n\nBut her reaction is also over the top. What are you expected to do?

Yes, its only hair and its your hair. But doing something like this right before a wedding, where you're basically #3 in the wedding was a bit selfish. And if your bride recommended something a bit conservative... Purple is not it. My hair is purple and black so I get it. But your mix is a bit out there. Conservative would have been like brown, or brown with highlights. You're definitely going to get more conversation than the bride.

To take one conversation from months ago and assume it meant you had no limits whatsoever is a mistake.\n\nI didn\u2019t really give my bridesmaids much guidance on their hair besides that it be down. They all chose to do their own hair which was fine. I gave permission to do their own thing but it was obviously within reason.

You\u2019re the MOH, you don\u2019t just dye your hair an incredibly unnatural color a week before the wedding when you\u2019re going to be standing next to the bride without even a heads up.

She asked that if I did I went a more natural color instead so I did, because I love her and respect that its her day and she has to live with those pictures the rest of her life whereas I only see them on the wall when I go visit her.

Maybe it was a mistake, but getting her relatives to bully you is worse.  You could offer to bow out of the wedding party or to stay away in order that her  photos can be all coordinated.

Considering how much OP says they change their hair color, this shouldn't have been an issue to go with something less stand outish", "He\u2019s not a guest he\u2019s the man of honor so he\u2019s in the bridal party", "He's the main person on her half of the bridal party and changed his hair colour to something drastic three days before", "He said in comments that he spoke to his other hairdresser friends and temp colour not recommended.", "I can not find anywhere where the bride suggested something conservative. Just that she didn\u2019t care if it was coloured or not.", "I feel like a single color and multiple colors are very different. Like if he usually goes with stuff like \"mossy green\" like described here, then that's a big difference between that and 3 different really bright colors. Like my bf has dyed his hair a single vibrant color a couple times and it looks really cool, but after a few glances it doesn't really stand out to you, whereas when someone has multicolored bright hair it tends to be more attention grabbing and doesn't blend into the background of your eye as easily."]}
