It sounds so vain but a big part of weddings are the photos, and a major change to your appearance will change the aesthetic because you are center stage. I specifically chose a cap sleeve dress for one of my bridesmaids to partially cover her tattoo. It\u2019s a beautiful piece and I love it, but it\u2019s bright and distracting and I didn\u2019t want it in the photo. That was my choice as the bride. I never up front told her that was the reason for the cut of her dress because I didn\u2019t want to sound like a dick, and she looked stunning in it anyhow. Then a week or two before my wedding she got a HUGE new piece that took up her entire arm. I was pretty annoyed. The new tat was a witchy tarot card thing with an enormous pentagram in the center and I was getting married in a CATHOLIC CHURCH. She offered to try to cover it with makeup and failed (she turned down using my MUA\u2019s airbrush and her attempt to cover it failed). So she walked as my bridesmaid even though she pissed off all the religious family members. Years later I\u2019m over it obviously, but she could\u2019ve waited a few weeks.\n\nSame situation here-your bride wasn\u2019t envisioning pink and purple hair in her photos (although mint green is not exactly a conservative color either). And such a bright and dramatic change would have been worth running by her. It wasn\u2019t a considerate thing to do\n\nBut her reaction is also over the top. What are you expected to do?

Yes, its only hair and its your hair. But doing something like this right before a wedding, where you're basically #3 in the wedding was a bit selfish. And if your bride recommended something a bit conservative... Purple is not it. My hair is purple and black so I get it. But your mix is a bit out there.

You\u2019re the MOH, you don\u2019t just dye your hair an incredibly unnatural color a week before the wedding when you\u2019re going to be standing next to the bride without even a heads up. Weddings have colored themes. Blue, purple and pink is almost certainly not going to go with anything that green and white wouldve previously. If you\u2019re a hairdresser, you should understand color complements by heart. \n\nI get wanting to dye your hair, but colors like that only last a few weeks anyway, and you\u2019re clearly experimental. As much as \u2018your body your choice\u2019 seeing as you have such an integral role in the wedding and will be visible in a vast majority of her pics, you absolutely should have cleared this with her first and if the washed out green was really bugging you, picked a color that wouldn\u2019t clash with her theme, since like I said, fashion colors aren\u2019t a even remotely permanent or long lasting.\n\nETA: it\u2019s not controlling to give your *friend* this information. It\u2019s just being courteous. If Reddit can\u2019t understand that a fashion hair color that lasts 2 weeks isn\u2019t worth more than a clearly extremely close friendship, y\u2019all need to get out more. There\u2019s battles to pick and battles not to pick. This is one that it isn\u2019t hard to accommodate.

She asked that if I did I went a more natural color instead so I did, because I love her and respect that its her day and she has to live with those pictures the rest of her life whereas I only see them on the wall when I go visit her.

Maybe it was a mistake, but getting her relatives to bully you is worse.  You could offer to bow out of the wedding party or to stay away in order that her  photos can be all coordinated.
