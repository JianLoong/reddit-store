You can't dictate what your friend does, even if that's making other friends and spending less time with you. She also shouldn't be bringing up gossip like that.", "What was the comment? That changes things.", "NTA - you need her to take it back. Or you need to throw her under the bus pretty quick here.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot in this world that is truly yours, but your reputation is yours alone. Don\u2019t let someone else ruin it.", "NTA Your friend was wrong to do that to you, especially given the fact that you are not in the best situation right now. Real friends don't do that. Sadly, it sounds like you are growing apart, which is normal as you grow older.", "Yeah, but question: how was I dictating her? I only wish her the best, i may not agree with some things but I haven\u2019t ever stopped her from doing anything.", "\u201c___\u2019s mum sleeps around a lot\u201d", "Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f", "> Recently, she has been reconnecting with the people we went to school with who were once my friends, and she\u2019s been going out lots more and doing some things that are a bit questionable for her age, however I will not judge her. \n\nThat's the part that made me think you are, in fact, judging her.

Maybe it was out of fear of getting into trouble?", "How did she pin the blame on you? Did your friends buy it? Like who says that unprompted and is like \u201cso and so made me say it\u201d", "She told on me on a call which we were on privately at the time to play along and to not deny it, whilst I kept on going \u201cwhat? What do you mean\u201d. She then on this group chat said (because people were asking questions as she said this comment on a phone call) that I said it. Hopefully that clears it up."]}
