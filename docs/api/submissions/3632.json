But deliberately always waiting to pray until the food is ready and then forcing everyone to wait for you to the extent that their food gets cold sounds like a power trip for her.

It's a power play or attention seeking behavior. Remind her (maybe by reminding someone else first to avoid conflict) that it is forbidden in Islam to keep food waiting. If food is ready & served you must sit and eat before praying. It's the only time prayer can be delayed. Google it.

That's a really bad word to say for a Muslim - as a Muslim, I'd be INCREDIBLY offended if someone called me that.  So shame, shame, SHAME on her for calling you that.\n\nAs for her prayers - it's not exactly a surprise when the prayers are supposed to be performed.  And they all have a \"window\" that they can be performed in.  Many of those windows are hours long.  The shortest window would probably be Maghrib prayer (the one done between sunset and when twilight has faded), but even with that you still have SOME time.\n\nBut to be safe, just don't serve dinner at sunset (or just wait a few minutes), and you should be fine.

To you, not communicating how you feel properly with this woman before pulling moves like this, her, for insisting on doing her prayers before everyone eats so the food gets cold, everyone here seems so childish. \n\nYou could have easily pulled her aside and let her know that it bothered you that this happens. From the way you told your story, everyone goes along without complaint about this, so to just do a 180 like that is kind of crappy. Yes, she says go ahead, but everyone insists on doing otherwise and now she's come to expect people to wait for her to join the table.

I am non-denominational. I simply live along the lines of \"Jesus was a cool dude, be more like Him\" (mire in depth than that, of course, but that's the gist). Anything that looks like a ritual to me that Jesus Himself did not partake in, I move away from. When a church focuses more on DOING rather than BEING, it's a no from me.", "Comments say it's at the aunt's house, OP is the one cooking, and she has tried to work around MiL's prayers but EVERY TIME MiL will do something else until the food is on the table. This is all %100 intentional by the MiL.", "Ours provides both and you take whichever you prefer.", "Here\u2019s a joke you can use whenever needed:\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a Baptist and a Methodist?\n\nA Methodist will say \u201chi\u201d to you in a liquor store!", "'Jesus made a whip from some ropes and chased them out of the temple, he drove out their sheep and cattle, scattered the money changers coins over the floor, and turned over their tables.'", "I respect that and agree, especially your last point."]}
