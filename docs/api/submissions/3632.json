But deliberately always waiting to pray until the food is ready and then forcing everyone to wait for you to the extent that their food gets cold sounds like a power trip for her.

It's a power play or attention seeking behavior. Remind her (maybe by reminding someone else first to avoid conflict) that it is forbidden in Islam to keep food waiting. If food is ready & served you must sit and eat before praying. It's the only time prayer can be delayed. Google it.

That's a really bad word to say for a Muslim - as a Muslim, I'd be INCREDIBLY offended if someone called me that.  So shame, shame, SHAME on her for calling you that.\n\nAs for her prayers - it's not exactly a surprise when the prayers are supposed to be performed.  And they all have a \"window\" that they can be performed in.  Many of those windows are hours long.  The shortest window would probably be Maghrib prayer (the one done between sunset and when twilight has faded), but even with that you still have SOME time.\n\nBut to be safe, just don't serve dinner at sunset (or just wait a few minutes), and you should be fine.

To you, not communicating how you feel properly with this woman before pulling moves like this, her, for insisting on doing her prayers before everyone eats so the food gets cold, everyone here seems so childish. \n\nYou could have easily pulled her aside and let her know that it bothered you that this happens. From the way you told your story, everyone goes along without complaint about this, so to just do a 180 like that is kind of crappy. Yes, she says go ahead, but everyone insists on doing otherwise and now she's come to expect people to wait for her to join the table.

She is deliberately planning mealtime around her performance, I mean, prayer.", "There are specific times she should be praying at. These can be planned around. She is fucking with you.", "I\u2019m not a Muslim but grew up in a Muslim country. I thought they have a set time to pray based on the sun position. At my school we have a reminder to pray.", "NTA", "No, the Muslim prayers being referenced can be scheduled around other things, they have to happen at set times. So the meal should be scheduled around the prayer time, but it's not possible to do it the other way around.\n\nThe MIL is being unreasonable in many ways but Muslim belief does not allow rescheduling those prayers so that part isn't up for negotiation.", "I don't understand this scenario, prayer time changes with the season and there's a set time when she needs to pray. Why don't you just remind her its prayer time, or tell her you'll take the food out after she's finished?\n\nEdit after reading other comments: NTA \n\nTime to go nuclear petty she should not be using religion as a flex move. \n\nGet the prayer timetable from the local mosque it should be online. It'll tell you when the prayer times are. Set meal times after prayer slot. I can't remember the exact rules but its usually 1 hour after call to prayer but again depends on season and country. Again local mosque can help with this.\n\nIf she tries to go pray just let her know her prayer is 'Kazaa' late so she might as well eat first. \n\nOr if you really want to mess with her, go pray at the correct time and call her to pray with you. She won't have a single comeback to this response\ud83d\ude05 without looking completely stupid.", "OP - I sincerely appreciate that you took this feedback and honestly are considering it! Very seldom do we see posters here take any contrary thoughts/ideas to heart and consideration. Good job! Also, NTA! She said eat, I'd have eaten to!", "Then NTA for sure. This is very clearly a power play on her end, and hopefully the family will continue to eat when the food is ready moving forward.  After it happens a couple times she may even change her behavior and stop throwing temper tantrums.", "Yeah this is a deliberate power play. NTA, but she sure is. Muslims are supposed to pray at certain times. If she isn\u2019t then she\u2019s clearly not so concerned with following her religion as she makes it out to be. She doesn\u2019t get to opt out of following the set times but then act like prayer is SO important to her when it\u2019s meal time. This is BS and everyone knows it. Your husband is just too chicken shit to stand up to her.", "Okay, definitely NTA, then.  However, I think the better solution would be to trick her into not getting the timing right with her prayers.  For instance, you all dig in before she has a chance to start them or you wait until she starts until you begin the last minute prep for lunch.  Defeat the prayer exhibitionism, eat when you want.", "I don\u2019t like your husbands approach. Has he ever tried to change them? Has he tried to stand up for you? How does he know they won\u2019t change? \n\nIf you just quietly give in to such people (Mil and Sil) then they will not change. You have to make sure they respect you and mind their language when they speak to you. Disrespecting you and comparing you to a pig should never be taken quietly no matter what.", "What type of example are you setting for your children? That it is okay to be treated that way and to allow.", "I guess I missed that, I was thinking the MIL made the meal", "Well, if you are cooking. That should make it easy to solve your problem. Simply call out, \u201cMIL dinner will be ready soon. You can pray now so you will be finished by the time I serve the meal.\u201d\n\nAre her kids less religious? Is all of this theatrical prayer designed to shame her children?", "Don\u2019t listen to them OP. That\u2019s a faded out rule", "Sorry, you weren't the host. It wasn't your house. \n\nNext time, snack while you're cooking when you know she's going to be delaying everyone's meal with her little power trip.", "Yeah I'm definitely in agreement on this", "There are windows of times when prayers can be done, some of which can be for several hours. She is obviously doing it deliberately.", "Everyone knows there\u2019s a window, it doesn\u2019t have to be exactly on the dot. That\u2019s just a power move on her MILs part.", ">Or if you really want to mess with her, go pray at the correct time and call her to pray with you. She won't have a single comeback to this response\ud83d\ude05 without looking completely stupid.\n\nAren't there Muslim prayer apps as well?  Could OP get an app that would do a prayer call at the set times?", "Wait so you're not supposed to exceed one hour after call to prayer???! I thought it was from one call to prayer to the next one and you can choose whichever time you want from there. \ud83e\udd2f", ">Has he ever tried to change them?\n\nI think he may have before otherwise he wouldn't act so defeated and hopeless about it now. That's a good question to ask him though.\n\n>Has he tried to stand up for you?\n\nThere weren't really any times he had to defend me before this time. I'm generally a peaceful person but when it comes to food, Ihad my differences with them but that's between me and them, things like criticizing my cooking and stuff. Now my cooking is a hundred times better than when we first got married and even if they want to say something, they can't \ud83d\ude03\n\n\n>Disrespecting you and comparing you to a pig should never be taken quietly no matter what.\n\nI hear you, thanks for that.", "Uhh we don't have kids yet and not planning to till I'm done with uni and get a job. But I get what you're saying.", "Because a snack is going to prevent the dinner she cooked from going cold? If the hosts want to make the distinction of \u201cmy house\u201d clear they need to cook. Otherwise Cook gets to eat when they want", "Thats an even better idea,  I forgot about those. Leave the phone on super loud so v everyone can hear the call to prayer\ud83e\udd23", "They actually do sell clocks that will ring when it's time to pray, some even automatically adjust themselves when there are changes. I do believe there are apps as well", "On prayer times there are time limits I\u2019d say for when you can pray before the next call to prayer. It does differ between each prayer but as the time is shorter now you have even less time to pray", "No some have time limits, in the UK because of the shorter days all 3 prayers are pretty much done within 3 hours in the middle of winter. \n\nI'm not very religious but family is, I think maghrib (sunset) and Zuhr (noon) have a time limit as they are specific points when the sun moves from noon and it becomes afternoon then you can't pray the noon prayer you have to pray the late prayer. Same with Maghrib if the sunset is over you missed the prayer.\n\n I can't remember the exact specifics for the others hopefully a more knowledgeable person can assist. \n\nBeing on your period is the only time you wouldn't pray. If she's supposedly religious I don't understand why she'd wait to pray, no one waits around to pray. She sounds like shes been messing with you all.", "What happens if you don't pray within those times? Is your prayer not accepted by Allah?", "You have to ask forgiveness for missing prayer,  if she's only praying to mess with you, none of her prayers are accepted. \n\nPrayer is about subjugation to a higher power,  you pray to cleanse your sins and be thankful for the life you live.  To gather resolve to continue on the right & good path. Prayer is only accepted if the intent is good.  \n\nYou really should mess with her head,  turn into a full on pious Muslim.  It'll be hilarious.", "You may want to consider visiting a local mosque and asking to have a chat with the Imam. Explain the situation to them and let them educate you on the topic.\n\nThey may be the best resouces for answers to some of the prayer questions that you're coming up with here. They may not be able to give you any guidance on dealing with MIL herself. But they should be able to help you to understand what should be happening here.", "This isn't directed at you, more of a rant/vent, but why's this so complicated that you can't get a clear picture without going to a mosque? It almost feels like it's deliberately kept that way - ambiguous.", "I\u2019m sorry, but what? If you have questions about things you know nothing about, who do you ask? An expert on the topic or some randos on the internet?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\nPeople are telling you to go to someone you can not only be sure knows what they\u2019re talking about, but who can also be used against your MIL\u2019s bullshit.", "Prayer times are impacted due to the seasons and length of days. Longer days means you have more time in between prayers, shorter days means shorter time frame. \n\nYou don't really need to worry about the technicalities. Rule is, when you hear the call to pray, you pray. No excuses\n\nIf your MIL is taking her time and its not due to ill-health, she's messing with you and her family are enabling her. Stop cooking for them, they can & should deal with her behaviour not you!", "I understand your frustration.\n\nI'm not muslim myself, so I don't know if this is supposed to be an area that is clear or not. But, from your questions, particularly the ones I commented on, its clear that you aren't muslim either.\n\nI also saw from other people's comments that some of the \"rules of prayer\", as it were, are dependent on where you are. Which is understandable, because to my knowledge the timing is linked to the length of the day.\n\nI suggested the path I did because a local Imam is going to be the one best suited for helping you to understand the Islamic daily prayers both globally and locally.\n\nIf its a simple and clear matter, they'll be able to answer it in a quick and straight forward way. If it is complex, they will be the best ones to decomplexify it for you.\n\nAnd thinking about it, they may also be able to help you understand what parts if what is happening are a matter of their faith, what parts may be related to MILs cultural background, and what parts may be just her.\n\nAnd being able to seperate those may be more invaluable to you than anything.", "The reason you can\u2019t get a clear picture without going to the mosque is your MIL is intentionally making it hazy by lying to you in order to manipulate you. It\u2019s not deliberately ambiguous, you have a bad actor intentionally sowing confusion because she can weaponize you not knowing details. Talk to the Iman. They have authority. This isn\u2019t Christianity where she can pull well i practice in my own personal way. There are rules and hierarchy and she\u2019s not at the top outside of her home, where she\u2019s spreading misinformation.", "I get what mean but it\u2019s not really kept that way. It\u2019s like how scholars in subjects know a lot of stuff about that topic cos they learnt and studied it. It\u2019s the same with imams and teachers in a mosque. They studied it so they kinda know what they\u2019re on about. \n\nWhereas others like me and you might not know a lot cos we\u2019ve never gone into that much detail about stuff like this. I mean you can always search it up but be wary of what you do read as well", "Please excuse my thoughtless reply \ud83d\ude4f you were being helpful and kind. Thank you I will go to them.", "Oh oh that makes a lot more sense now. Please excuse the ignorance."]}
