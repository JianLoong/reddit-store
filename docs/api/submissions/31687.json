However she didn\u2019t accidentally use the same name. It\u2019s also not in her family and not sentimental to her. She purposely picked it knowing it was a name sentimental to you, and then acted like you were the arse. \n\nShe\u2019s not your friend and you\u2019re better off without her. Friends don\u2019t purposely hurt you.", "So you had your baby name picked out, and when you were discussing baby names with your friend, you told her the one you'd picked out, and then she later picks that name? What an asshole.", "NTA but your friend is. I get so annoyed at how reddit tends to vote situations like this. \"You don't have a monopoly on names\" is unnecessary to say. No one thinks they own a name, but for someone to say that a name means something important to them, and their \"friend\" deciding to use it for their own baby is selfish at worst and not courteous at best. It's just an unkind thing to do and OP is correct to be upset about it.", "NTA. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You wanted this name, and it means something to you. You don\u2019t own this name, you\u2019re right, but the fact that your friend then made a TikTok to try make you look bad tells me that she is a bad person. She can take the name, but I feel if you reach out it could just end in a fight.", "NTA Things I\u2019ve learned from Reddit: never tell anyone your real baby name choice until after your baby is born and named.", "I'm not going to touch the question you asked. Instead I am going to say that IMHO naming babies after specific people is a mistake because it imposes a burden of your expectations on them, as to how they will turn out. You always think of  the child in relation to their namesake, instead of the new and unique individual that is the new child. So this may be a blessing in disguise.", "NTA. It's not worth it to confront them. Whether that name had any meaning to them before you brought it up to her or not isn't something you're going to know for sure. Decide if there is enough respect left in that relationship to keep this friend - there is no one answer here.", "NTA - you aren\u2019t claiming ownership over the name but told your friend because it had sentiment to you! your friend is in the wrong particularly as she posted an instagram post and was quite rude when \u201cletting you know\u201d about the name she picked", "I totally get why you\u2019re hurt and frustrated. And I know it\u2019s a little too late for this, but that\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t tell anyone but my partner about the baby names that I love the most. \n\nIt\u2019s a shitty move from your friend and I\u2019m not sure how much of a friendship will be left\u2026 but I guess there\u2019s nothing much you can do about the fact that her baby will be named your favourite name. \n\nIf you want to salvage the friendship, maybe try to embrace it and love that baby as much as you love the kid where you got the name from. It could end up making your friendship even stronger. If you think about it, it\u2019s nice to know that you and your friend are so in sync that she loves the name as much as you do. \n\nStill I would tell her that you are very hurt and that you need to rebuild the trust you had in her. But (if you care for her) that you don\u2019t want to lose her over this. \n\nAnd you never know, maybe there will come an even greater baby name your way when you get pregnant yourself. In the end it\u2019s always: look at your baby and you will know who he / she is and which name fits best. \n\nBest of luck for your friendship!", "NTA, she's not a friend.", "NTA, it's abit mean to steal a name idea like that. When you have kids, use the name anyway. If your friend finds that weird, sounds like a her problem.", "NAH - Nobody has monopoly on baby names. You can choose your own baby name and even then, it's a decision between the parents.\n\nYou have zero ground on this one.", "More than one child can have the same name. Especially since your child and their\u2019s will likely be a couple years apart and if you\u2019re not in the same town will have totally different friends, schools, clubs, sports teams etc. \n\nAs you have children you see less of your old friends anyway and socialize more with the parents in your children\u2019s classes/activities. Basically your child and your friend\u2019s child will live totally separate lives. No one cares (no one should care) if you use the name too!", "ESH. You don't have any claims to the name, and though you say it isn't common, it's clearly not an uncommon name either, given your friend and her husband were both considering it and you have a classmate with that name. On top of all this, you don't have and aren't in the process of having any children, so for you it's all hypothetical. \n\nOtoh, your friend is a total AH for 'subtweeting' (is there an Instagram equivalent?) on social media. It does show a lack of respect for you and a level of immaturity when she could've just had an adult conversation with you. Putting your words in scare quotes is rude af.", "NTA. \nYour friend posting about it on social media is beyond childish and not the behaviour I would expect of someone who deems themselves mature enough to have a baby.", "YTA - Because you couldn\u2019t keep your mouth shut!

Fast forward and she's pregnant but I am again too  she is a few months ahead, and announces they are using the name we had chosen for a boy. I was livid and super hurt that when my husband confronted it they both just went \"oh, well you guys aren't finding out the sex again but she knows she's having a boy\" it ended up working out as although when we talked about this name years ago it was very uncommon it is actually in the top 5 names for boys the lot few years and we have a name that fits our son so much better.\n\nBut you can still be hurt by it.
