{"id": 585, "submission_id": "yhgggg", "title": "AITA for not Photoshopping my Stillborn Aunt into a Family Photo?", "selftext": "There's a little known fact in my family (at least among the cousins and grandkids), that one of my aunts, Aunt Ann, was supposed to be a twin, but her twin sister was stillborn. It's not exactly a taboo topic or anything, just some random trivia that never has any reason to come up in conversation.\n\nOne day, I was visiting my Grandma, and showing her how I was using Photoshop for one of my school projects. She seemed really interested, got quiet for moment, and then got up and pulled a small diary out of her closet. She started talking, and to my surprise, I learned that she had named her lost baby, Sophia Rose. Every year she would write a birthday message in the diary, just to remember her. She had never told anybody all these years, because back then, that sort of thing just wasn't talked about. But now she wondered if there were any way I could photoshop another picture of Aunt Ann into her favorite family picture, so it looked like her twin was there. She had always wondered what it would've looked like with her family completed.\n\nI, of course, was quite willing to do it. My Aunt Ann was having lunch with my mother and I a few days later, and I thought I'd run the idea by her then and ask her if she had a nice picture I could use.\n\nBut, to my surprise, both my mom and Aunt Ann were horrified with the idea. Aunt Ann especially said she didn't want it done, that using her picture for a dead person was morbid and creeped her out. It would be her face representing a ghost. Plus, apparently they weren't even identical twins, just fraternal, so they wouldn't have actually looked alike. She very clearly didn't feel comfortable with it.\n\nI figured I probably shouldn't do it since Aunt Ann had quite clearly said no. When I told her, Grandma didn't seem upset or disappointed, she just said that she understood, and thanked me for looking into it. I told her if she ever wanted to talk to me about Sophia or make something else in memorial, I'd do it, but she said that it was fine, and it was so long ago it didn't really matter. She never brought it up again.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but years later now, I was chatting with one of my much younger cousins (not Aunt Ann's kid). Apparently she had never heard about Aunt Ann's twin, and grew quite upset with me when I told the story of the Photoshop request. She said that was a really heartless thing to do, to deny our grieving grandma's one chance to see what could've been. It could've given her some closure. She said I should've just done the picture anyways and just not told Aunt Ann about it. She would've never known.\n\nNow I'm feeling guilty.  Even if it wasn't Sophia Rose, Grandma still could've pretended for just a moment that her lost daughter was there. It wouldn't have been hard to do it in secret, and I could've at least given her that. On the other hand, it feels really crummy to go behind my Aunt's back like that when she drew such a clear boundary.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667142184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhgggg/aita_for_not_photoshopping_my_stillborn_aunt_into/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You asked your aunt for consent, she unfortunately refused, and then you told grandma.\n\nIt's not your fault and this is a delicate matter. Aunt Ann surely would have seen the picture eventually (I can see grandma hanging it up somewhere) and who knows how she would have reacted then.\n\nYour cousin sounds quite young, she probably has a less mature viewing of the world. Don't take her words to heart.\n\nIf anything, aunt Ann and grandma should talk about this and see if a compromise could be reached.", "NTA - You, your grandmother and your aunt handled a delicate situation to each of your satisfactions. Now years later, this cousin comes in and stirs up some shit where there wasn't any before.", "NAH. That sounds like a hard decision. From the tone of your post, it sounds like your grandmother has since passed, so you can't photoshop something for her now, but if you believe in an afterlife, know that any photoshopping you would do would be pointless. She's with her daughter now, and doesn't need any photos.", "I have to say NTA. We all have digital autonomy. We have the right to refuse having our likeness used in manners we don't want. It was a good thing you asked permission before just doing it.", "NAH. Grief is an intensely personal emotion and your grandma, mum and aunt will have processed their loss in different ways.", "NAH everyone here has a point \n\nMaybe someone could draw her? With a mix of your families looks or something so it doesn\u2018t look exactly like your aunt? Or maybe how she always imagined she would have looked like?", "Waw this is really complicated. I think a compromise could be made. Since it was fraternal twins why not find a stock photo of a woman who looks like she'd fit into the family and Photoshop her in and tell your grandmother it's what you imagine she'd look like? That way grandma gets what she wants and you're not going behind your aunt's back", "Grandma was the baby\u2019s mother.

With current technology, would you be able to take some photos of immediate family and use them to generate a face? It would still be a guess but maybe grams would like that.", "YTA. I agree with your friend 100%, That would have been an incredible thing to do for your grandmother who was never allowed to properly grieve your aunt. It would have been so easy for you to do. You never had to tell your aunt and mother. It was none of their business really. And it really did matter to your grandmother or she wouldn't have asked to begin with. She had that response because for the last what 40 years she's had to hide her loss and grief. How incredibly sad."]}
