My father already had plans to go to his new girlfriend\u2019s house for Easter that same year. (I wasn\u2019t there because my fiance and I moved to Texas) He moved that same woman in May 2022. She\u2019s only been gone 3 months and he already moved a new woman in and not just some random woman he met at the store, he\u2019s known her for years and had been friends with her for years. He didn\u2019t tell me they even started dating I found out through facebook. It hurt because I felt like my mom was replaced so easily and he didn\u2019t take my feelings into consideration at all. I know it\u2019s his life and his relationship but it was my mom he replaced. I\u2019ve distanced myself and don\u2019t even know if I want him at my wedding at this point because he\u2019s been fighting me the whole way with making his girlfriend comfortable around my mom\u2019s family and basically wants to cater the day to her.

However, my stepdad had a new girlfriend the week after my mom died, and I have never forgiven him. So I know how you feel.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from with a similar experience.  My dad moved on very quickly after mom passed as well.  It\u2019s just so uncomfortable & weird for me & my kids.  Seems my dad just tripped over a woman he knew after mom passed & replaced mom.  I\u2019m still baffled by it.\n\nI\u2019m cordial with that woman, but I can only be around them so long.  I haven\u2019t said anything to my dad because he seems happy & much better than after mom passed.  He\u2019s still a wreck sometimes when we talk about mom, and I know he\u2019ll always love her.  Everything else is just so awkward though.\n\nMy advice - don\u2019t say anything mean & only be around them as you can handle.  Everyone deals with the toughest situations differently.  Really sounds like your dad is dealing with it much differently than you are & than you anticipated. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever get comfortable with the entire situation to be honest.  It\u2019s so fucking bizarre & makes little sense to me.  The only comfort I have is knowing my dad seems to be happy.", "NTA\n\nYou're not the asshole for setting boundaries for what *you* are and are not willing to do. If you're not willing to forgive him and you don't want him at your wedding, those are things *you* control and boundaries *you* can set *for yourself*. You're not a jerk for doing that.\n\nYou would be the jerk, however, if you tried to force your father into doing something he's not willing to do. You control your environment; he can control his.", "The timeline makes me question whether he was having an affair.\n\nThere's fast and there's seamless.\n\nNTA for how you feel.", "NTA - I get it, my father did the exact same thing, 4 months after my mother died. It was like my mother never existed.", "That\u2019s gotta be tough to see. My best friend died of cancer after 20 years of (happy) marriage. She told me before she died she hoped he\u2019d remarry, she didn\u2019t want him to be alone. \n\nWithin months he was dating a friend of theirs (no cheating prior) & moved in and married within the year. They had similar interests and already knowing each other made it more comfortable for him. And he had loved being married and wanted that again. \n\nAll that said, it sucks to see someone move on so fast. Honestly we just want them to show grief and feel it\u2019s a struggle. But as he put it, her death taught him that every\u2026 minute\u2026 is precious and we can all go at any time. And he also wanted the companionship. \n\nWas your dad a good husband to your mom? That\u2019s what to hang onto. I know it\u2019s hard. But it doesn\u2019t mean he loved your mom less. And widowers move on waaay faster than widows. \n\nHave a wonderful wedding and so very sorry about your mom. Hugs from this mom. And btw, I don\u2019t like my friend\u2019s new wife either. I still feel he married too soon. We\u2019re very loyal to our friends and mothers memories lol!\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "NTA- i think everyone is missing your line that your dad wants your mom's family to accept his new gf and wants you to make your wedding day about her too? Am i interpreting that correctly? If that is right, he would not be invited to my wedding either. This isn't about moving on, it's about erasing your mom.", "INFO: How old is your dad?\n\n\u2014\u2014-\nIn 2019 I lost my husband suddenly and then 12 days later, my mom. That means my dad and I were basically both widowed at the same time. So, I have experience with this as the kid and the recently widowed. \n\nIf your dad is like my dad, he\u2019s lonely. My dad was spending a lot of time with a widow from his church and I *hated* it but I also understood it. He\u2019s older, hasn\u2019t spent a lot of time alone, and doesn\u2019t want to spend the last years of his life alone. Older widow/ers don\u2019t have the luxury of time and so tend to move forward more quickly. \n\nAs the widow, I can also tell you that my current partner isn\u2019t a replacement or stand-in for my late husband. They\u2019re two totally different people that I love for totally different reasons. It\u2019s not about replacing anyone. \n\nGrief is complex. You lost your mom, but your dad lost his spouse. How he chooses to grieve and continue living is not for you to judge.", "I think take into consideration he was married for 25 years and then add however long they were dating before that. Maybe he also hates feeling alone when he hasn\u2019t been alone in maybe over 30 years? So it could be a comfort thing and a way to also bury his grief?", "NAH. Sometimes people move on super quickly because they can't bear to be alone. Other people stay single forever for a variety of reasons. He's not replacing your mom, he's not asking you to forget your mom, he's grieving in his own way. You're certainly allowed your own feelings on this, and you both should have a lot of grace for each other during this period. His relationship with your mom is not your relationship with it, and neither person's grief should stomp on the other's.", "NTA in the sense that he wants to force you to invite this woman to your wedding.  You get to set up the guest list.  Even if it was discussed between him and your mom prior to her death, he shouldn't be surprised by your reaction.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid and if you don\u2019t feel comfortable having her at your wedding you shouldn\u2019t even let them come. Your wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9e. Enjoy it. I wish you a lifetime of happiness.", "I mean for all you know they had discussed the idea of him dating again before she died", "NAH.\n\nFeelings are so individual, and I get that you feel like he's trying to replace your mother. He's not though. He's trying to fill the hole that she left and unfortunately it's unlikely that he ever will. \n\nIt sounds like he's in a rebound relationship. People are ok to admit that folks have rebounds after a break up, but they frown on a rebound after a death. His new partner is very likely a rebound but in an older 'new' couple they're far more likely to stay together rather than ending it when a rebound is done because dating is tough. And it's less acceptable for them to just split once the rebound is done. Not to mention the implied shame of having a rebound relationship after a long term one that ended with a death. People in general will be judging him and he *knows* that. It probably hurts that all of his family and friends are judging him too.\n\nBut his feelings don't negate yours and I can understand how it might feel like he's just trying to pretend your mother didn't exist. She did though, you're walking breathing proof of that. You've distanced yourself, but the solution here is communication. Not avoidance. \n\nYour wedding is going to stir up all kinds of feelings for him. He'll be remembering that he was at the end of that aisle and watched your mother walk down it towards him. He'll be remembering that everyone was celebrating them as a couple. He'll remember all of the days where he thought that they would have forever together. And that now they don't. I'm not surprised that he wants his new partner there, it's a way to have a support to get through all of those feelings without being alone in them.\n\nHe's a person. Not just 'dad'. He's a man with feelings and loss. You're looking at his relationship as trying to replace your mother, but he's probably just struggling to get through each day and finding whatever comfort he can from where ever he can find it. Don't add to his loss by removing yourself from his life as well just because you imagine that his coping mechanism is him trying to fill your mother's place. No one ever can. He knows that, and so do you.", "How did your mom pass? If she was sick for a long time, I don\u2019t think this is unusual. People deserve to be happy. If it was sudden, it\u2019s not ideal. But we can\u2019t control what other people do. It may be a way for your dad to avoid dealing with his feelings.", "I'm not sure if I can fairly call you an asshole. More that you're still grieving your mother. And it must really really really hurt. And your father has not handled this well at all. Of course things are not going to be very comfortable around your mother's family. This is you & your fianc\u00e9's day. You shouldn't have to cater to your father's girlfriend. Tell your dad if his girlfriend is going to be so uncomfortable then perhaps she shouldn't come. Ask him to explain thoroughly why you and your fiance cater wedding to his girlfriend. That your mother's family will be there because they are your family. Tell him due to his insistence on catering your wedding to his girlfriend you are considering rescinding his invite.", "Your NTA for setting boundaries.  He is an adult and can make his choices about his love life however you have to keep in mind that he cannot replace your mother.  He took another as a lover but that place as a mother can never be taken, your mother will always be just that.\n\nHonestly though your father wanting you to cater to his partner at the wedding to make her comfortable is overstepping.  You will have to put your foot down on that, either they put on their adult size pants on and be respectful guests or she or both of them can stay at home.", "NTA. You have no obligation to invite him.", "NAH - honestly we cant judge this. You do not have contact with him which is your right but that means you also dont have his perspective.", "Nta don\u2019t let him at your wedding, it isn\u2019t time for him to show off his new gf.

He\u2019s alone and widowed now. His child is off in her own life. He has a right to move on, at his own pace. OP may need some grief counseling.", "Yeah, no. I'm sure you suspect it but there was cheating involved there almost for sure, in any case is your weeding, don't budge to accommodate \"His GF\" he doesn't want face your moms family for a reason at that's his fault not yours. Don't concede\n\nNTA", "NTA. Some folks just can't handle being single. Can't handle taking care of themselves. Can't handle being alone. I don't really get it. My dad took 5 years to even consider dating. I was ready for him to date before he was. It saddens me when people have no idea how to be an individual so instead they rush to the next person. I shouldn't be judgemental, but it just feels wrong on so many levels.", "INFO: Was the death unexpected/sudden?", "NTA. He was having an affair with this woman before your mom died. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s been found most men can\u2019t even wait until their partner is cold in the grave before moving on, many even abandon sick spouses. Your feelings of hurt are valid because at the end of the day it comes off as him not valuing your mother enough to even mourn her\u2026 that she was just a place holder for a role and anyone would do. \n\nIdk if it\u2019s worth abandoning the relationship over because at the end of the day he\u2019s not technically doing anything wrong but the feeling of ick can be hard to ignore.\n\nAlso if he\u2019s involved in your wedding, it works but she would simply be a plus one- nothing else, she isn\u2019t your mother so if he\u2019s trying to get her to have a formal role that\u2019s a huge fucking red flag.", "3 months after his wife dies he moves a woman who he\u2019s know for years into the home???? Yeah she was his mistress. NTA", "Have you talked to your father about this? Some couples discuss this towards the end of one of their lives - my step dad had discussed it with his second wife when she was in the final stages of cancer.  Or rather, she discussed it with him. She knew he would end up with someone quickly and wanted to make a few suggestions! My mum, who ended up being his third wife, was her friend. After they married, they had a very happy life together for 10 years before he died. (They had been friends for 50+ years by that point.)\n\nThat said, they did not marry until 18 months after her passing, but they got together 6 months after. He was one of those men who needed a wife and companion. \n\nIf I am reading this right your dad hooked up within a month of your mum passing? That sounds very hard. I think it is difficult to understand the nuances if you weren\u2019t even in the country - is it possible that your mum gave her blessing? It really isn\u2019t that unusual for a widow or widower to move onto an old friend and then marry. I don\u2019t think it is bad either, unless cheating is involved or children living at home. That changes everything. \n\nYou have emigrated. Was your mum ill when you did that? Perhaps he thinks you didn\u2019t take his imminent widowhood into consideration when you moved away? It is very hard if you have been in a proper LTR for years, to suddenly be on your own. And men tend to do worse than women. \n\nI don\u2019t think he has replaced your mum. He has found a new companion. It doesn\u2019t mean your mum meant nothing, it likely means he is unable to live on his own. It may be that no one will ever meet the level of love and happiness your parents shared, but that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t entitled to have a comfortable partnership with someone else though. \n\nYou are completely entitled to feeling the way you do, but I would encourage you to seek some therapy to deal with the feelings and the loss of your mum. It will make your life less painful. I don\u2019t think cutting yourself off from your dad permanently is the right thing to do if you previously had a good relationship with him, but if you need to go LC for awhile then explain that you are finding it all too difficult. \n\nI am so sorry for the loss of your mum. I lost my dad when I was in my 20s. I had a very hard year and then I had some bereavement counselling to try to deal with my sadness. Be kind to yourself. It is a huge thing to deal with.", "Just curious, did your mom die suddenly or was she suffering from a terminal illness and her death was expected over time? If it was the latter, I can definitely see how your dad could move to so quickly. A lot of times in those circumstances, people start the grieving process before their loved ones passes. \n\nEither way, grief can make people do some weird things and it\u2019s possible that your dad may not feel comfortable being alone since he was married for so long. NAH", "He wants to basically cater your wedding day to his \"new\" gf? WTF? There is no way your mom's family is going to be OK with having his new gf shoved down their throat. And it's your wedding day. YOUR Wedding Day! Good luck with that seating plan if you do indeed invite him to the wedding. Congrats on the wedding. NTA", "Many men simply cannot bear being alone, your father is not alone in this. I've also read that the happier and longer the marriage was, the quicker men move to a new relationship. (Women not as much).\n\nDon't cut your dad out because your idea of how he should grieve doesn't match his. You are entitled to your feelings, and maybe you could talk to him about it. NAH.", "YTA dating someone known for years is hardly flippantly moving on", "Slightly out of line IMHO - I lost my wife of 15 years to cancer and was  a widower at the age of 43yo - she was my world and my marriage could not have been better - I was lost without her and struggled to get out of bed in the morning as there seemed no point - I decided that if I was invited to any event with out social group - friends etc I would make myself go even though I had no interest in leaving the house - 5 months later I was at a function and met one of my wife\u2019s friends (she was divorced) and we rekindled our friendship and 2 years later we married - it was easier for me personally as my now wife knew my background and what I went though for the years before my wife\u2019s passing - I dated outside my friends group at it was much harder as you seems to get a lot of pity which was not needed or requested - overcoming grief is never the same for everyone and my current wife will never replace my first wife - this new lady your Dad is seeing will never replace his wife who passed but you need to respect his wishes and actions as it is a very lonely existence when you lose someone who was your world and I can honestly say he will be crying hisself to sleep most nights for the first 12 months irrespective of who he is seeing - the first 12 months are terrible as you have all the first or Xmas, birthdays anniversary\u2019s etc", "How long exactly is someone supposed to suffer before they can move on?", "NAH.

Don't let them gaslight you", "NTA just because he\u2019s ready to move on with another woman doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ready to meet her.  That would just be too hard for me emotionally to see my father with another woman. It\u2019s ruin any celebration for me.  I wouldn\u2019t see him if she was around.  He can make his choices, you make yours.", "NTA  don\u2019t invite the girlfriend to the wedding. It is your day", "Men like him only care about themselves and believe they need a woman to take care of them. He can\u2019t handle being alone. Moving on so quickly with a woman he has known for years would make me wonder if they were having an affair before your mother passed.  Sounds like he is trying to make your wedding about him and his gf. If he can\u2019t handle people not supporting his questionable relationship at your wedding then he really shouldn\u2019t go. Go get therapy to deal with the betrayal and loss you are experiencing. NTA", "I don't think YTA, but neither is your dad. You are both grieving. The compromise is that your dad comes to your wedding without her. Tell him you are not ready for that. \nHopefully, both of you should know that you loved the same person just differently.", "Everyone mourns differently. A very important thing to remember in times like those. I am sorry for your loss OP, but trust me when i say, he hasn't forgotten her. This might be a way to cope. This might be his pace/pattern of mourning. Either way, at least attempt to respect his wishes. NAH.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI get it, I was in your situation, my mom was remarried a year after my dad died. They were married 45 years. It was weird, her and new husband had known each other for years, but I came to the realization that it was a me problem. He was nice, my mom was happy, and both of them really needed companionship (he had been recently widowed too.) \n\nI let go and gave it a chance. My kids called him grandpa. My mom still misses my dad and talks about him, it wasn\u2019t a replacement, it was just different.", "My parents were married nearly 60 years, and my mom always said that you could tell people with good marriages...they remarried quickly because it had been a good life.", "NTA.  I'd fully suspect he was having an affair long before your mother's death.  The whole thing happened way too fast.", "Light YTA. Happily married men get married again and faster. Companionship was good for them so they want it again in a way it\u2019s a huge compliment to your mom. And the fact that it is someone he\u2019s known for years is not surprising. Without any evidence of moving on prior to your moms passing, I can\u2019t say he\u2019s an AH.", "YTA.  \n\nI get that you are upset.  Those are your feelings and you are entitled to them.  But why take it out on your dad?\n\nLosing a partner is really really hard for some people.  They may feel dazed or confused or lonely and they just look for something to stabilized themselves and something\u2019s to distract themselves from the pain they are feeling.  \n\nUntil you lose a partner of 25 years, you have no idea how you will react.  Cut the guy some slack.  You may not like what he is doing, but I bet he is going through so many more emotions internally than you realize.", "NTA I am very sorry for the loss of your mother, a very strong hug. \n\nFor you it is a very strange feeling, it is obviously a very strong thing to feel and see your mother replaced. What your father would have done first is to heal with therapy, since they were a marriage of 25 years and take into account your feelings that you would react with this woman. Hopefully they were not lovers, because it is very fast for someone to get over a 25 year love affair. I hope I am wrong. \n\nIt is very important that you tell your father and talk to him about how you felt about it. Therapy will help you a lot to heal the loss of your mother, you will be able to move on and get through this.\n\n I wish you the best of luck OP, much peace in your heart.", "All I can say is he doesn\u2019t let grass get under his feet. That\u2019s a tough call.", "He replaced his SO. No one can replace your mom.", "NTA. My Stepdad was looking to date only 6 weeks after my mother died, they'd been married for 30 years. He just couldn't handle being alone. I was pretty upset with him, especially when he would invite them over when I visited and ask me to put in a good word. No! Very awkward all round. \n\nWe had to watch him join and talk about dating sites and the problems he had with new women. I had to sit him down and explain that while he could do whatever he wanted, us children (all grown adults) didn't really want to hear anything unless he got serious.\n\nAnd then he got serious. With a woman nothing like my mother. But he treated her the same way as my mother, even called her the same pet name. It was still weird and awkward. None of us like her much at all. And we noticed that she wouldn't put up with him the same way my Mum did. So he started treating the new woman better. Doing things for her that Mum had been begging for years for. Over 30 years and numerous health issues he never visited my mother in hospital except for births. But as soon as the new woman was sick he was organising to be by her side as much as possible. It was pretty hard to take.\n\nOver the years though we've all gotten used to her. She still has a lot of opinions we don't like, but she does for the most part treat us pretty well. We all figured that its his life to live, and while we don't like a lot of the things he says and does we do need to accept some things if we want to keep the relationship going. We don't have to understand them though. Grief hits everyone in different ways, and some people can't stand to be left alone. I could never imagine replacing a partner like he did, but I'm also fairly independant and tend to be the caretaker rather than receiver. \n\nYour grief is just as important as his though, you lost your mother. Other people need to understand that you're allowed to be upset, that you need space from him right now. You may forgive him or not, that's up to you. But having lost one parent, its really hard to also lose another even when you don't like what they're doing. You can choose to offer a relationship with him without any partners for now if you want. Or give yourself some time to process your own grief without him. Other people don't get to decide these things for you.", "You\u2019re NTA. It is sad that he moved on so fast, I can see where youre coming from. It is a little uncomfortable. It is going to take time for things to settle and forgive your dad for seemingly moving on so fast, and that\u2019s okay. I would still try to invite him to the wedding. That is a huge and beautiful day for you, and he should be there. If you arent comfortable with her around, then you need to have a conversation with your dad. It is YOUR day, and it is disgusting for him to try and cater it around her. This day has nothing to do with her.", "NTA but have you had an open, honest conversation with him about this? About how his actions make you feel? You're both adults and need to talk to him about it. It's not easy but it will help. What you decide after that is up to you. If you have him, only him, as a guest at your wedding but not the reception? Could be a compromise but at the end of the day it's what you feel comfortable with not anyone else.", "It\u2019s scary common for this to happen.

I lost my mom at the same time. So I get how it feels. I still cry at times, but it\u2019s better. We are still in the grieving process I think. It takes a good while to get through. \nAs far as your dad goes, it\u2019s weird, but it is common for men to very very quickly get in another relationship when their wife dies. It takes women a lot longer. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s like that, maybe men need to be connected to someone after having married for so long? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to replace your mom, no one can do that. Maybe because your parents marriage was so good  he is capable of loving someone again. Before my dad passed he told my mom that it is a testament to a good marriage if the surviving partner remarries. It means they were happy with their first spouse. \nAs far as your wedding, it\u2019s your day. It\u2019s about you.

Grief is a strange thing and everyone's experience is unique. The length and intensity of grief doesn't say much about the relationship between the deceased and the bereaved, but instead is much more about the bereaved person's response to death, to loss and to recovery. Some people will never repartner after death or divorce because they still mourn, while others may find that being alone is liberating. Some people can't stand being alone, some feel that life is short and there's no time to waste, some find comfort in being with another person who has gone through the same thing. It's not for you or I to judge another person for their relationship choices after bereavement.", "NAH but you will be if you don't sit down and try to talk to him like an adult\n\nI understand why you're upset OP but there is more to this than you realize. I suggest you do some research into spousal grief and why some people need to move on quicker than others. Then sit down with your dad and try to understand his perspective.\n\nThere is a lot of missing info here that you are not privy to. He and your mom may have discussed moving on before she died, she might have wanted him to be happy. He may have been lonely and needed a companion to help him cope with the loss. They might not have even been a couple when she died (married in name only) so he had less to grieve when she died. He may have been cheating on her so moving on was easy. You owe it to yourself to find out why.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

My father already had plans to go to his new girlfriend\u2019s house for Easter that same year. (I wasn\u2019t there because my fiance and I moved to Texas) He moved that same woman in May 2022. She\u2019s only been gone 3 months and he already moved a new woman in and not just some random woman he met at the store, he\u2019s known her for years and had been friends with her for years. He didn\u2019t tell me they even started dating I found out through facebook. It hurt because I felt like my mom was replaced so easily and he didn\u2019t take my feelings into consideration at all. I know it\u2019s his life and his relationship but it was my mom he replaced. I\u2019ve distanced myself and don\u2019t even know if I want him at my wedding at this point because he\u2019s been fighting me the whole way with making his girlfriend comfortable around my mom\u2019s family and basically wants to cater the day to her. Mind you they were married for 25 years.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This may have been his coping mechanism. Grieving was too much for him and this was the easiest option to ignore how he felt, and he already felt comfortable with this girl. I also see your side because it\u2019s hard to see that role get replaced with a new person, especially so soon. There is no \u201cset time\u201d or method of grieving. Everyone moves at their pace and reacts in their way. I doubt he did this out of malice. He is probably just wanting to shove his tears away for a rainy day and find a distraction. He knows her and already has a bond so it was probably just natural to him. Also, and I mean no disrespect, but when a spouse dies a lot of people tend to need a new person in the role. You spend your life working with a partner who provides at the house, vice versa, you\u2019re just used to two incomes or to having a hand to hold, you\u2019ve never really been alone before and you were suddenly just made alone? It\u2019s really hard and I see both sides. Through no fault of your own I doubt you leaving the state is helping because he\u2019s alone-alone now. You aren\u2019t in the wrong, just asking how that could be hurting him right now. You\u2019re NTA but try to mend things with your father. You\u2019re both suffering and him losing his child will only make this worse, and I don\u2019t think losing your second parent is going to help you either.", "NTA. Exact same thing happened to my siblings and I. After my mum passed, my dad broke his rental lease and was moving into this woman's house 3 months later. Someone he met after she passed and none of us had met or spoken with. I had to pack up my mum's stuff alone otherwise it would be discarded. The breaking point for me was him showing no compassion for our grief. Nothing from him on the first mother's day without her, her birthday. I couldn't fake a relationship any longer, and we haven't had any contact in 3 years. (None of his kids do). To my knowledge he doesn't know I've had a baby. For me, every conversation we had would leave me in tears, and I would be in a panic before I would call. It became too much for me. It's one thing to move on, but to be so cold to your kids when they have experienced a loss so great is unfathomable to me. Follow your gut, and weigh up the pros and cons to maintaining the relationship.", "This is above Reddit's pay grade. The wedding vows are \"till death do you part.\"  Very tragically, they have parted. \n\nTo me, taking on a new relationship within three months seems pretty out there. However, I also cannot even fathom what it is like to lose a wife of 25 years. So, I can't judge him too harshly. Plus, at some point, the man has a right to move on with his life and can't spend the rest of it tending a grave. Three months seems really quick, but at the end of the day, he doesn't have to answer to anybody about that. Not even you. \n\nBut on the other side of the coin, you don't have any obligation to meet with her or include her in your wedding. If he's pressing to bend wedding things around her, that's a foul on his part. Just the fact that you're even letting him bring her is more than what he should expect. He should shut up and be grateful he is even getting that much.", "nta. you\u2019re entitled to your feelings.", "So how long should he be lonely and sad for until you give him permission?", "Sure they weren't seeing each other before....? Nta", "NTA. If my dad did that I would never speak to him again", "If mom died a slow death from a certain medical condition part of the mourning process happens before the actual death of said person. You have time to prepare for the inevitable.\n\nSo the process itself might have taken longer.\n\nOf course the other option is that. OP's dad like many other men cheated on his wife, but before he could dump her for his affair partner she died....", "1 week? Was she even in the ground at that point?\n\nI understand some people need to move on faster because they don't want to be alone but can we at least bury her first?", "Honestly seeing this consistently throughout just confirms men aren\u2019t shit, let the grave get cold at least \ud83d\udc80", "I have been around a lot of divorces and think it is something a bit different.  When someone comes out of a long term marriage, they literally have no idea how to just date.  The only relationship type they know is the super-involved, marriage-esque type relationship because that is the only relationship they've had for a zillion years.  They just have no idea how to do a non-intense relationship.\n\nSo, that's why the first post divorce (or here, death) GF tends to be something that they go all-in on.  Most of the time it blows up pretty badly in about 3-9 months.  But sometimes they don't.", "OP lost his mother. A mother is irreplaceable but a wife it seems is easily and quickly replaced. Perhaps OP's dad and his now gf were close even when OP's mom was alive?", "Sounds like Dad may not be dealing with his deceased wife\u2019s passing.

It's your right not to communicate with him, but it also means you don't see things from his viewpoint.", "Similar things happened with friends of my parents, the new girlfriend was debuted VERY quickly after the wife passed away, and the general consensus is she was around before.", "Reminds me of a story I saw someone share around Reddit somewhere (I don't believe it was this subreddit though). A guy who I believe was a friend of the storyteller dies unexpectedly from a sudden heart attack. During a money raising baseball game for the wife, it comes out she's already engaged.\n\nAnd like your case, this was a mere four months later. Like not dating, but full blown engaged.\n\nI get things are different for everyone...but I can't imagine getting over a spouse's death enough *that* fast, even just dating. Even as a previously discussed thing.\n\nHe said everyone, especially her kids, were not exactly thrilled by the news. Right or wrong, I can totally understand at the very least the kids being upset.", "I dunno, considering the fact he never mentioned it to OP and he had to find out through facebook? this doesn't feel entirely right.", "Dog the Bounty Hunter shocked me with how quickly he moved on after his wife died.", "Good point. Dad could also have been having an affair too. We don't know.", "That sounds like a sappy excuse invited to justify men not even letting the grave get cold before moving onto the next woman \ud83d\udc80", "Maybe a little longer than a month would be more considerate?", "At least enough time for grass to grow on the grave IMO, but then again statistically speaking plenty of men leave their sick spouses on the deathbed to find next wifey so maybe that\u2019s asking too much.", "I mean honestly you\u2019re right. Kind of wondering if it\u2019s a coping mechanism in this case", "I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t ask her to be a guest at the funeral", "My grandfather remarried within 3 days of my grandmother's passing... and brought his new wife to her funeral.", "That\u2019s immediately where my mind went.  He already knew this woman and then suddenly they were together and moving in?  I feel like something was going on.", ">We don't know\n\nThere's a lot we don't know.\n\nHad a coworker take care of his wife through a bad cancer diagnosis and chemo. Surprisingly, she responded to the treatment well, and they got a few more good years. Then the cancer came back and he took care of her again for over a year while she was dying. This is the mother of his children.\n\nAbout six months after she was buried, he was seeing a woman regularly. His kids were old enough to understand a few things:\n\n1) He had been mourning her death for many months before she passed. A lot of those last few months were long periods of pain and she wasn't always there, mentally. In some ways, she was gone long before her funeral.\n\n2) A person dating in their later 50s knows what they are looking for. They don't have to date a whole bunch of people casually to learn what a good match looks like.\n\nSo without more info, I'd choose to give leeway to the bereaved. We don't know how he lost his wife, how long of a process that was, or how the two of them viewed their relationship, especially at the end.", "I get moving on quick but this is.. disrespectful. THREE DAYS??", "That's messed up", "There's a saying in India that the widower is already searching for his wife's replacement at the funeral itself. And of course Indian  men need to remarry asap because they're congenitally helpless, need a housekeeper cum nanny cum lover to ease their lives.", "Yeah exactly. Now if it was a random women then I'd be more inclined to think more positively but because she was already a good friend, there was a good chance something was going on already.", "It shocked all of us!\n\nI took some very strange comfort in how it mirrored the plot of my grandmother's all-time favorite book (Cold Sassy Tree).", "My grandmother once told me with pride that grandpa had \"never done his own laundry\" and I always felt like it backfired a bit."]}
