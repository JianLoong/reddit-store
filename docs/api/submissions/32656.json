Dina was very upset. \n\nI looked at it and it was of a beautiful new ornament for his and his new wife's, Tabby, Xmas tree. It was of a fireplace with 11 stockings hanging off it. At the top it said \"Williams Family 2023\" and each stocking had a name on it. Since I don't know Tabby's family well I only recognized about half the names.\n\n They included Daniel, Tabby, Aaron, Kelly, Kerry, Robert, Nick, Allison, Matthew, Rick, and Lisa. \n\nNotice something? \n\nMy sisters' and my name were not included nor were my 2 nieces'. Every person included was a child, grandchild, and son or daughter in law of Tabby. \n\nThe \"Williams Family\" ornament only had 2 Williams on it, my father and Tabby. Note, my father and Tabby have been together for over a decade but they finally married this year. \n\nI couldn't stand seeing my sister so heartbroken and I knew that my father would delete his post so he doesn't look bad to his friends since my sister commented on him forgetting us. So, I screenshot the picture and shared it to my own profile. Additionally, i told everyone some things about him not being there for any of us. Including how he has still never directly contacted Alice about her health after she discovered she had cancer last year. Just a \"Get Well\" message on Facebook and a donation to her GoFund Me for medical expenses. Never asked for an update.\n\nSo, AITA?

I know it will probably embarrass him and make them had a bad opinion of him. One thing I know about him is how much he is competitive with his brothers.

Post whatever you want on your FB page, that\u2019s your right as a full grown adult. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You shouldn't publicly shame someone over what are personal family matters.", "NTA! NTA!!", "What were the reactions to your post?", "NTA and I hope to god you tagged waste of space father in it so his friends could all see it too!", "They don't share. She rarely posts on hers but he shares posts daily. \n\nShe ordered the ornament and said that it only allowed 12 names. I wonder why she didn't leave out the in-laws or hyphenate the couples so there would be room for us. They used 11 of the 12 available spots. I know Allie and Matthew are married and that would have given 2 open spots. Maybe hyphenate pairs of grandkids too. That would have opened at least 2 more spots. 4 spots for Dina-X (her husband), K-J (my nieces), Alice, and me. \n\nWhat gets me is Tabby said she looked for one with more name spots but couldn't find one. I took that to mean she thought of us then decided to just leave us out instead of her in laws. Btw, Dina found ornaments with up to 25 name spots.\n\nYou might say, why blame your father when it was Tabby who ordered it? I blame him because he should have looked at the ornament and been offended that none of his kids or grandkids were included. He wasn't. He liked the ornament so much he proudly shared it with all his Facebook friends. Then had the nerve to be surprised that we were upset.", "Are you the father?", "Tabby is full of shit lol.  Funny how only his kids got excluded.", "This sort of thing isn't always the best way to go, it can make situations explode into something far worse. But in this case - NTA. Clearly this was not your dad's idea, it was Tabby's, but he accepted it, took a picture, and proudly shared it. That means he fully condoned essentially acting like his kids and grandkids don't exist. And then got upset that his kid is upset about being erased from his life. \n\nHonestly the 'get well/donation' thing with no concern for the welfare of his daughter would have been the final straw for me. You guys are way more forgiving than I am. Now it's time to be there for each other as you decide the next step here. Personally, I'd cut contact, he's shown over and over again he doesn't give a damn about any of you.\n\nAlso, I hope Alice is doing well.", "If my father ever had the audacity to forget me or siblings on something like this, I\u2019d do worse. Even if it\u2019s an AH move, forgetting your children for your new ones is even more of an AH move. Don\u2019t ever let him forget it unless he apologizes and shows change.", "Your NTA but who cares what your dad/stepmom post? You\u2019re a grown ass adult. The easy solution is if you don\u2019t like it then go NC.", "NTA \nIf people don't want to be spoken of poorly, they shouldn't behave poorly.", "NTA! More people should call out their shitty 'father's'. These jerks do irreparable damage and create whole new 'phony' lives. Step Mother is also very inconsiderate.", "Posting about your family drama is low brow and low class. Why choose to make your life a Jerry Springer episode. What do you benefit from this besides stirring up controversy and drama and having people gossip about you?", "ESH\n\nYour father and his wife are obvious AHs. That's clear to anyone. Leaving you and your sisters out of the Christmas ornament was thoughtless enough, but then posting it on social media as if it's something lovely? Gross. \n\nBut you're just as bad. I say this as someone older than all of you, but you don't do yourself any favours by airing your family dirty laundry on social media. Posting a whole \"Look At How Our Daddy Doesn't Love Us Anymore\" litany on FB just makes you look childish and pathetic (in the most literal sense of the word), like you're looking for everyone to comfort you like small children. \n\nI actually sympathize with you deeply. I can't imagine how hurtful your father's behaviour must be. But this whole, \"I'm going to take to Facebook and tell the whole world how he hurt our feelings!\" thing is just going to make people gossip about how you have no boundaries and overshare.\n\nSocial media is not your diary or your therapist. If you are hurting, it is not the place to record the details of that. I suggest you get an actual therapist to discuss the issues with your dad and his new wife. I promise, it will be more helpful.", "I mean, it's whatever, but you know he didn't have anything to do with that ornament, right? His wife bought it with her kids in mind and he was fool enough to think posting it would make him look like a family man. \n\nAnd it probably does, but only to people who don't know about you. Anyone who knows you caught sight of the omissions as well as you did.\n\nHe makes himself look bad. You can help, but your help isn't necessary.", "I mean...I don't have a super close relationship with my parents so maybe I just don't get it, but y'all are adults in yours 30s. He has remarried. I don't totally get why not being on the ornament is such a huge deal to you NOW. ESH I guess.", "I\u2019m going with EH\u2026 don\u2019t post your dirty laundry on SM. Not everything needs to be broadcasted", "YTA just talk calmly to your dad (maybe over coffee)", "QQ", "Nope. NTA. Your dad\u2019s an AH.", "NTA", "NTA. But should consider that using social media that way can come back to bite you. Also maybe should have talked to him face to face instead shaming him online.", "NTA- is well known and be careful what you put online. It is out there.\n\nI have a similar story.  One of the times I was looking up my ghosted dad I found his work bio page.\n\nHe listed being proud of a child of his who just graduated in his attributes.\n\nI showed it to my husband.  He was like oh that's sweet.\n\nThen I told my husband, he's not talking about me.", "This is how I would deal with someone loke this myself. So if you're an asshole I am to. NTA\n\nEDIT: GRAMMAR", "NTA, I like how you responded.  How did he think you would all react?", "NTA", "NTA but\u2026what\u2019s your end goal? Is it really going to make you feel better or add more stress? These are genuine questions, you don\u2019t need to answer them to me, but just think about. Every time I confront or call out someone, I try to think about the outcome I want/need and the outcome that is likely to happen and how I\u2019ll feel after.", "NTA. Drag him.", "NTA.\n\nIf he doesn't want to look like an asshole, he shouldn't be an asshole.", "Ha ha ha ha", "It\u2019s very possible", "Some \"care emojis\", some \"heart emojis\", and Tabby did a thumbs up.", "Eww. Terrible take.", "He and Tabby made my twin sister cry so my aim was to either make them cry or at least make them look bad. I don't know if I did but I hope so.", "Oh I still blame him even if she ordered it.   I just thought since she did it might have been her posting it too.   It would never occur to my bf to post a pic of an ornament I had made.  Lol.  \n\nAlso, wth, he definitely the ah for not checking on your sister.   My dad went to all my dr appts with me when I had cancer.   And I was 40.    He might have sat in the waiting room for some, but he was there.", "This makes your dad even worse.", "Oh hell, totally NTA.  They could have ordered a different piece of Christmas decor or a whole set of Christmas ornaments with individual names on it. This was intentionally mean.  What jerks people can be on the holidays!"]}
