Dina was very upset. \n\nI looked at it and it was of a beautiful new ornament for his and his new wife's, Tabby, Xmas tree. It was of a fireplace with 11 stockings hanging off it. At the top it said \"Williams Family 2023\" and each stocking had a name on it. Since I don't know Tabby's family well I only recognized about half the names.\n\n They included Daniel, Tabby, Aaron, Kelly, Kerry, Robert, Nick, Allison, Matthew, Rick, and Lisa. \n\nNotice something? \n\nMy sisters' and my name were not included nor were my 2 nieces'. Every person included was a child, grandchild, and son or daughter in law of Tabby. \n\nThe \"Williams Family\" ornament only had 2 Williams on it, my father and Tabby. Note, my father and Tabby have been together for over a decade but they finally married this year. \n\nI couldn't stand seeing my sister so heartbroken and I knew that my father would delete his post so he doesn't look bad to his friends since my sister commented on him forgetting us. So, I screenshot the picture and shared it to my own profile. Additionally, i told everyone some things about him not being there for any of us. Including how he has still never directly contacted Alice about her health after she discovered she had cancer last year. Just a \"Get Well\" message on Facebook and a donation to her GoFund Me for medical expenses. Never asked for an update.\n\nSo, AITA?

I know it will probably embarrass him and make them had a bad opinion of him. One thing I know about him is how much he is competitive with his brothers.

I think this is one of those moments in life where you know that a relationship has been irrevocably broken.  He\u2019s clearly one of those \u201cnew wife who dis\u201d type of shitty men.

She rarely posts on hers but he shares posts daily. \n\nShe ordered the ornament and said that it only allowed 12 names. I wonder why she didn't leave out the in-laws or hyphenate the couples so there would be room for us. They used 11 of the 12 available spots. I know Allie and Matthew are married and that would have given 2 open spots. Maybe hyphenate pairs of grandkids too. That would have opened at least 2 more spots. 4 spots for Dina-X (her husband), K-J (my nieces), Alice, and me. \n\nWhat gets me is Tabby said she looked for one with more name spots but couldn't find one. I took that to mean she thought of us then decided to just leave us out instead of her in laws. Btw, Dina found ornaments with up to 25 name spots.\n\nYou might say, why blame your father when it was Tabby who ordered it? I blame him because he should have looked at the ornament and been offended that none of his kids or grandkids were included. He wasn't. He liked the ornament so much he proudly shared it with all his Facebook friends. Then had the nerve to be surprised that we were upset.", "Are you the father?", "Tabby is full of shit lol.  Funny how only his kids got excluded."]}
