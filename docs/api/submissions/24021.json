You didn\u2019t really care bc you knew she was incorrect in the definition and she\u2019s jus got this habit of finding her favorite lol \ud83d\ude02 I feel like it\u2019ll jus blow over. I wouldn\u2019t apologize though bc there\u2019s nothing for anyone to be sorry about.", "Your GF needs to learn what the definition of a picky eater is.\n\nYour GF may have thought she was being cute by calling you a picky eater.  Your friends, who never met her,  defended you.  And explained to her why she was wrong.\n\nYour friends did not disrespect her, they corrected her ignorance on what a picky eater is.\n\nIf you defended her, you would have been defending someone who is factually wrong.\n\nYour GF is insecure.\n\nNTA", "ESH, you all sound like you\u2019re 12.", "No apology needed as her if she is willing to apologise first as she made the first comment then you might", "NTA. I might get your gf\u2019s perspective - she\u2019s wrong on the common definition of \u201cpicky eater\u201d, but her eating the same thing at restaurants doesn\u2019t necessarily make her a picky eater either. I do the exact same thing at restaurants, but I will try/eat most things. I just struggle with decision fatigue, so by generally eating the same thing when I go out, I avoid an unnecessary decision. \n\nRegardless, she\u2019s being defensive for some reason y\u2019all should probably talk about.", "I don\u2019t think so, I talked to her parents and they said she\u2019s been doing this for years. Apparently she ate off the kids menu well into her teens because she refused to choose something else off the menu.", "OP literally didn't do anything. How is he an AH in this?", "The very definition of a picky eater!", "She's projecting her issues onto you. I guess she thought that go over well with your old friends?", "NTA \n\nPicky eating :\nIt is characterised by an unwillingness to eat familiar foods or to try new foods, as well as strong food preferences. \n\nShe is textbook picky eater. Show her this post and tell her she owes you and your friends an apology. \n\nWould like to ask the \u201cit isn\u2019t worth it\u201d comment though. Do you do that often? Not tell her things or say things because of how she acts?", "NTA - Does she know what being a picky eater means? Your friends aren't wrong. Taking time to figure out what you want to eat because you like a few things on the menu doesn't make you a picky eater. Not being able to find anything or like your gf, only willing to eat one thing on the menu makes you a picky eater. You and your friends were right. I highly doubt your friends are going to apologizes and you and them don't need to. Your gf is making a fight over nothing.", "NTA  Dump her!", "Your GF sounds exhausting.\n\nYour friends are correct.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe just doesn\u2019t know what being a picky eater means and has been using it incorrectly. If she can\u2019t accept that and continues to make a big deal out of this she\u2019s an insecure psycho.", "I think your girlfriend opened that door herself! Had she not said anything about you being picky your friends wouldn\u2019t have responded! So she has only herself to blame on this one. Next time she needs to hand out the menus and leave it at that. I\u2019ve always found it odd that when people bring up or say something they really don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s two cents on the topic! They want to say what they want and have zero reply. Again this one is all her!!!", "NTA. You\u2019re not picky lol I go to a restaurant and make the joke \u201cidk why I bother looking at the menu knowing full well I only eat 2 options\u201d my husband will try new things and take time to actually look he\u2019s not picky which is nice I however am with the pallet of a 5 year old \ud83d\ude02", "NTA..  your between a rock and a hard place on this one..  you caused it by simply letting her call you picky for so long and not sorting it sooner.. whether you apologise or not doesn't matter, this is a long term memory event to her now. And women have very long memories. Lol.."]}
