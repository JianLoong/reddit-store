Their split hasn't been good, they're taking it in turns to stay at the house until it sells.\n\nAs I'm currently home on maternity leave, I often take parcels in for them. When its Dean's week he will come over as soon as he can to collect and apologise for the inconvenience. He will also take Kate's parcels over to the house. Kate however has a history of being a pain. If a parcel for Dean comes on her week she refuses to take it in. If a parcel comes for her, she doesn't come over to collect it. We have to take it to her, but she often won't answer the door because she doesn't like to when home alone. My partner and I decided we were going to stop taking anything in for Kate, only for Dean.\n\nA parcel arrived for Kate yesterday. She wasn't in and the delivery guy tried to leave it with me. I refused to take it in so it went back to the depot. Turns out it was Kate's passport which she had left last time she was visiting her mum. It was in a box and couldn't go through the letterbox. Kate was meant to be going on holiday early this morning but now isn't able to as she couldn't get her passport in time. Kate's furious that I've caused her to miss her flight and has been calling me a bitch as she assumed I'd take it in until she saw the card saying it had gone to the depot. She has been complaining to my other neighbour, he doesn't like her and thinks it's funny that she's not learnt her lesson as she kept refusing to pick up parcels they took in for her. He stopped after breaking his wrist slipping on ice last year taking her parcel over. Now its Dean's week, he's been over to ask if I could take a parcel in for him, and he apologised for Kate's behaviour. \n\nI feel bad that she's missed her flight. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: We didn't tell Kate that we weren't taking anymore parcels in. I had only started doing it to be neighbourly as I was home. When my partner lived here on his own, he was never home during the day to take parcels in. We never had an arrangement with them.", "created_utc": 1670424261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf2tqs/aita_for_not_taking_my_neighbours_parcel_causing/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she knew it was an important package, SHE had the responsibility to let YOU know and ask if could keep an eye out.\n\nShe abused your generosity, and suffered the consequences of being a general pain in the backside. Her problem, not yours.", "NTA. You weren't obligated to take their parcels, and so frequently at that. You were doing a nice neighbourly thing, that doesn't mean it's your job to do it. You were home, but what if you weren't. \n\nNext time please tell her 'You know how you don't like answering the door when you are home? Well, same.'", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2018s old enough to take care of her own responsibilities, and I don\u2018t understand why she felt the need to insult you. That\u2018s totally out of line!", "NTA.  If it was that important to Kate, it was KATE'S RESPONSIBILITY to manage it.  Even a simple \"I desperately need my passport can you please keep an eye out for UPS?\" would have worked.\n\nYou didn't make Kate miss her flight.

But her behavior as described deserves this outcome and maybe she will learn her lesson about her entitled behavior.", "NTA, but Kate sure is. It isn't your fault that she left getting her passport to the last minute. It also isn't your responsibility to collect parcels for her - you aren't a post office or PO box, and it is up to you whether you want to or not. Also, if she can't be bothered to open her door for parcels when she's home, she shouldn't expect you to do so for her.", "NTA - You are not her personal concierge. If she was expecting an important package, she should have arranged to be home or at the very least communicated to you about it.", "NTA, if the package was that important to her she would have made special arrangements to make sure it got to her like requiring her signature or having it sent to a shipping distribution center for her to pick up. Or she could have reached out to you beforehand and checked in with you to see if you were able to accept delivery on her behalf. Adults not faulting doesn\u2019t make you an A.", "Not your mail, not your obligation to take it.\n\nNTA", "Nta, you were doing her a favour and she took the piss. Not your problem.", "NTA She is a jerk. While it may have been a good idea to let her know you didn\u2019t want to be a mailbox any longer, what were her arrangements if you were not at home? She should have thought of a much better solution for something so important. And TBH, be a little grateful for you taking the parcels in to begin with.", "NTA \n\nIf I don't want to do something for somebody, I start charging them money. $1 for a delivery acceptance fee, plus $5 a day for storage. If they agree to these terms, then you can start holding their packages. If not, reject everything.\n\nIf they didn't set up a prior arrangement, $50 for a special arrangement holding.\n\nI'm not against doing something for somebody, but when they are unappreciative of my efforts, I choose not to help them anymore.", "I don't think that you're TA here. It might be a case of everyone sucking, except that Kate seems to have alienated the entire neighborhood. And, you didn't do it on purpose, and she could have asked you.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA and you shouldn't feel bad. Kate's own behaviour has led to this point. You have been doing her a favour and she acts like you are paid help.\n\nSadly instead of learning her behaviour has consequences she has instead become more entitled. \n\nNext time she rings to rant, tell her you have a parcel for Dean which may be his passport too and for him to pick it up at his conveniences, whilst she is huffing and puffing at the shock, put the phone down and laugh for the rest of the day!", "NTA.  If there was no prior agreement, you are off the hook.  Normally, I might agree with others saying if you've done it in the past, you should let her know before stopping, but . . .\n\nThe key thing here is - she relied upon you to be home for a critical delivery without giving you a heads up or even asking if you were going to be home to take it in.  She is not entitled to expect you to be home for her deliveries all day long.", "NTA. She reaped what she sowed.", "NTA.  These are the consequences of her own behavior.", "NTA\n\nDemanding other people be inconvenienced to do you a favor is just\u2026 ugh awful and entitled.\n\nIf the package was so important she should have made arrangements. It\u2019s called adulting.", "NTA.  You were doing her a favor and she abused it.  She sounds like one of those entitled people that expects everyone to do everything for her.  You are the second person now that has stopped helping her.  She is a slow learner.", "NTA \u2013 since she has a history of being a pain when OP is doing a favor, she started acting entitled way before this. Thus you owe her nothing and in fact \u2013 she entirely deserved this especially if she was being rude to y'all before.\n\nIt is entirely on her to properly schedule out when to collect her own parcels, especially if she needs it in an emergency, and instead of relying on your communities goodwill.", "NTA. What an inflated sense of importance to think that you can demand your neighbors to take in parcels for you. \n\nRegardless if they have been doing so in the past, they do so because they feel like it, and you have no reasonable expectation to think you are entitled to treat your neighbors as your reception/baggage counter.", "That\u2019s a funny story. She reaped what she sowed. Bad will.", "Nta\n\nShe shouldn't have planned a trip she needed a passport for until she had the passport. Her poor planning isn't your fault.", "I can see how they split up.\n\nSeems like Kate needs to be more responsible and less-self centered....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
