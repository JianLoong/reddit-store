I KNOW everything needs to be hot washed and contact points sanitised. I did this the first time and we've already began doing it for this time starting with bedding. Then the towels. We won't shower until we have clean towels.\n\nHello there as the title states my partner's family has given us threadworms twice in one year. His family consists of two adults and 5 children at home. 3 of them are over 13 and there are twins aged 9. They have a developmental disorder and mentally they are about 5.\nThe first time I got them my partner was living at home and we were friends with benefits but now we're official and he lives with me. \n\nThe first time we got them I was the one who noticied when the symptoms began. Threadworms incubate from around 1-2 months so symptoms don't come straight away. I told my partner (fwb at the time) I said I'm sorry to assume but it must come from your family because I have no contact with children and children are the main cause. He agreed and told his mum. He bought me treament out of guilt (it's expensive). We all took it and they went away. I didn't judge him about this and I wasn't nasty because I know it's part of having children. \n\nNow about 2 weeks a go I get a UTI. I take two courses of antibiotics and it won't go away and I began to worry. My birthday came. I couldn't go out drinking or have sex. I had to rearrange my plans.\nLast night I noticed the itching and inspect myself. It's threadworms again. This is why my UTI won't go away.\n\nMy main worry is why have I been the one to inform the family they have worms twice? Why have they not been checking the younger twos anuses? How the hell are none of the 8 of them noticing it before me? I am willing to let them have another chance to change things but if it becomes a third time I will make a drastic decision.\n\nI believe I may be the asshole because worms are part of having kids and banning someone from seeing their family is cruel. I am just not willing to get worms again and again. Where the twins are developmentally delayed it will probably take them longer to grasp proper hygiene which will prevent this.

So when you're treating, you need to treat all members of the household AND wash all bedding and clean potentially contaminated surfaces.\n\nFor what it's worth, sometimes people have a pinworm infection and don't even notice.
