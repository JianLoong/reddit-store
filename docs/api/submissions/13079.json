Threadworms incubate from around 1-2 months so symptoms don't come straight away. I told my partner (fwb at the time) I said I'm sorry to assume but it must come from your family because I have no contact with children and children are the main cause. He agreed and told his mum. He bought me treament out of guilt (it's expensive). We all took it and they went away. I didn't judge him about this and I wasn't nasty because I know it's part of having children. \n\nNow about 2 weeks a go I get a UTI. I take two courses of antibiotics and it won't go away and I began to worry. My birthday came. I couldn't go out drinking or have sex. I had to rearrange my plans.\nLast night I noticed the itching and inspect myself. It's threadworms again. This is why my UTI won't go away.\n\nMy main worry is why have I been the one to inform the family they have worms twice? Why have they not been checking the younger twos anuses? How the hell are none of the 8 of them noticing it before me? I am willing to let them have another chance to change things but if it becomes a third time I will make a drastic decision.\n\nI believe I may be the asshole because worms are part of having kids and banning someone from seeing their family is cruel.

You can discuss with him your concerns and ask him to limit contact, but you can't tell him he can't see his family.\n\nI'm curious where you live, what country?\n\nThreadworms (pinworms) are common in much of the world, especially in young children because they're transmitted by ingesting pinworm eggs from a contaminated surface - bedding, clothing, and other surfaces that have come in contact with pinworm eggs or hands contaminated with them. So when you're treating, you need to treat all members of the household AND wash all bedding and clean potentially contaminated surfaces.\n\nFor what it's worth, sometimes people have a pinworm infection and don't even notice.
