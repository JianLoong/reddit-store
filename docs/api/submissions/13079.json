We spoke to his mum after this post and she confirmed one of the twins has them. \nThe NHS website states that they are common amongst children.\n\nETA2: My orginal post exceded the character limit so I removed a lot of details. I KNOW everything needs to be hot washed and contact points sanitised. I did this the first time and we've already began doing it for this time starting with bedding. Then the towels. We won't shower until we have clean towels.\n\nETA3: I did not think this would blow up like it has! I am working and can't reply properly. I am kinda getting annoyed with everyone telling me information about worms because I already know it. I suffered from them as a child and it was a pivotal point in my hygiene changing. I know how they spread and how they can be removed. I removed them last time with hot washing everything and anti baccing everything to death. I have access to google too. My post orginally exceeded the character limit so I deleted some details. Thank you all for your advice regardless it's nice to hear other perspectives. I only really wanted advice on preventing reinfection in a house that I have absolutely no control of and the advice of the potential ban. After reading comments ban was probably too strong of a word. We've been busy working and unable to have a proper chat. I will suggest we all treat ourselves every 6 months as a precaution hopefully it goes down okay. \n\nHello there as the title states my partner's family has given us threadworms twice in one year. His family consists of two adults and 5 children at home. 3 of them are over 13 and there are twins aged 9. They have a developmental disorder and mentally they are about 5.\nThe first time I got them my partner was living at home and we were friends with benefits but now we're official and he lives with me. \n\nThe first time we got them I was the one who noticied when the symptoms began. Threadworms incubate from around 1-2 months so symptoms don't come straight away. I told my partner (fwb at the time) I said I'm sorry to assume but it must come from your family because I have no contact with children and children are the main cause. He agreed and told his mum. He bought me treament out of guilt (it's expensive). We all took it and they went away. I didn't judge him about this and I wasn't nasty because I know it's part of having children. \n\nNow about 2 weeks a go I get a UTI. I take two courses of antibiotics and it won't go away and I began to worry. My birthday came. I couldn't go out drinking or have sex. I had to rearrange my plans.\nLast night I noticed the itching and inspect myself. It's threadworms again. This is why my UTI won't go away.\n\nMy main worry is why have I been the one to inform the family they have worms twice? Why have they not been checking the younger twos anuses? How the hell are none of the 8 of them noticing it before me? I am willing to let them have another chance to change things but if it becomes a third time I will make a drastic decision.\n\nI believe I may be the asshole because worms are part of having kids and banning someone from seeing their family is cruel. I am just not willing to get worms again and again. Where the twins are developmentally delayed it will probably take them longer to grasp proper hygiene which will prevent this. Hopefully I am wrong here.", "created_utc": 1679670891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120nc58/wibta_if_i_banned_my_partner_from_seeing_his/", "score": 1198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So when you're treating, you need to treat all members of the household AND wash all bedding and clean potentially contaminated surfaces.\n\nFor what it's worth, sometimes people have a pinworm infection and don't even notice.

I'm deeply sorry you experienced that.", "\nETA  your making this out to be way bigger issue than it actually is. Bum worms can't hurt you, you don't need a doctor for treatment just buy the chew tablets or chocolate squares over the counter at the pharmacy they aren't even exspensive. (Make sure you take the second does 2 weeks after infection and treat any indoor animals aswell because yes they are carriers). Make sure you hand wash and clean under your nails! Scub them good, keep them short! Finger nails are your highest contraction point.\n\nBet you BF to buy his family tablets for treatment and watch them take it. The kids are probably getting it from school.\n\nI live in rural Australia it's not uncommon to contract bum worms treatment is heaps easier then the internet makes it sound. From the sounds of it, it's most likely your or bfs first round of treatment wasn't completely successful.", "My orihinsl comment wasnt inflammatory in any way.

Haha.. \n\nOP that's awful.. they should be treating those children for their sake never mind anyone else. \n\nI would hands down not visit if they haven't cleared the worms and boil washed everything. \n\nPartner be damned, if he doesn't see the problem drop him back to the house lol.\n\nSure what would ya do if they weren't treating the kids for headlice...?\n\nPs.. threadworm stuff is not expensive here (ireland) how come you're paying a lot for it in the UK? No NHS coverage for that no?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Also, I have worked in elementary schools for almost 20 years, and I have never, not once, not ever, heard of someone having worms.

I lived with my dad and abusive step mom so I had to live with the itchy ass for sometimes a week before I\u2019d go to my moms and I\u2019d let my grandma take care of me.

I\u2019m going to say NTA because this really shouldn\u2019t be a reoccurring problem multiple times year and something needs to be done. However you can\u2019t just make unilateral decisions about who he sees. The best option would be to break up with him. He has butt worms and brings them home to you but doesn\u2019t do anything about it till you develop symptoms.", "I didn\u2019t know about threadworms till there was an out break at my nephews school and then it was really difficult to get rid of them. They struggled for over 6 months as they are so easily spread and difficult to clear once they have been introduced. It just takes one case in a family or school and they are everywhere. I would say this is not a reflection on hygiene or problems at home just bad luck.

It could have come from anyone.\nAt your in laws, the children are still young and the older ones probably don't care all that much about hygiene. Just tell your in laws to get treated and it will be fine. After visiting take a pill to kill the worms and 2 weeks later again if you are afraid to get it. This way you kill the worms before they have the chance to reproduce.", "NTA and this isn\u2019t common, at all, at least in the US. My cat had worms once, but it was an inside/outside cat.
