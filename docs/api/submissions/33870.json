I wasn't always sure of what to do and my parents weren't always easy to get ahold of.\nI was also volun-told to babysit for my mom's friends for free. They would always stay out about 3 hours late and I'd be home after midnight. Because of all of these things, I made a choice as an adult to never babysit ever again.\nI have severe anxiety that I've been in therapy for, coming from my teenage years due to balancing school, work, extracurriculars, and babysitting and feeling like I had no help or comfort in any of my family members.\nOn Christmas: the topic of kids and babysitting came up when someone asked  if birth order affected personality. There was some back and forth, but I said I think it does. When I was questioned about my reasoning, I just said that I had to be responsible in different ways than they had to.\nI was told I was being dramatic, then was pushed for more. I asked my youngest brother if he ever had to be responsible for younger siblings, and he, of course said no. I said that babysitting them put a lot of responsibility on me that I didn't consider appropriate for my age and maturity level, and that they'd never had to go through that. I also explained that I had to go without a lot of our parents' attention so they could have it (example: they missed my fencing tournaments and orchestra concerts to go watch my brothers' wrestling practices).\nAfter all of that, everyone was quiet, until my dad said,\n\"So you don't believe in family responsibility?\"\nI explained that I do, but that that there was a point where the amount of responsibility wasn't appropriate for one kid to handle. I also said that I don't think kids should be forced to babysit their siblings because it creates an unhealthy dynamic between them. My dad responded with,\n\"I didn't have to feed you or keep you in the house.\"\nI asked him what he thought would happen if he didn't do those things for me as a kid? He said,\n\"I'd have a skinny, cold kid.\"\nFor more context, aside from my wedding and $300 for rent one time, I never asked for anything from my parents after I left at 18. I thought about asking what he thought was his responsibility as a father, but I realized he wasn't taking me seriously, so I dropped the topic. I was told I was being ridiculous, and that I should let things from the past go.\nI'm wondering if I'm TA because my parents did need a lot of help with their kids growing up, especially with my special needs brother.

You were doing it frequently and for long periods of time. And they were often not available when problems arose. And getting handed over to their friends for free labor.  This is not a normal level of helping the family. \n\nI was the oldest of four. I had a friend who was the oldest of 9. And another who was 2nd oldest of 12. We all helped the younger kids. And did chores. But our parents were right there. And often older relatives like grandparents and aunts helped.  And if our parents went out occasionally, leaving us in charge, it was for a limited time and we were able to contact them with problems. When we babysitted other families, we were always paid. That was normal family responsibilities.\n\nYour father is gaslighting you as your words were truthful and he was looking bad to others.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your parents did to you was wrong. It's called parentification. Also, your father's mindset seems stuck somewhere in the middle of the 20th century regarding gender roles.

They'll never understand and they'll  never change.\n\nOh, and paragraphs are a thing for a reason ... LOL", "NTA.\n\nYou were parentified. It's a form of child abuse. It frequently happens to the oldest, often female child (but elder sons are not excluded). As you said so eloquently, it forces a different level of responsibility and maturity onto a child well before they are ready and creates an unhealthy dynamic between the siblings.\n\nIt sets different expectations for the siblings throughout their whole lives with the parentified child always expected to be mature, be self sacrificing, and to suffer 'for the good of the family'.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, your parents essentially 'pimped you out' to their friends to oversee their children.\n\nIt creates an unfair level of expectations onto the parentified child that plays out in becoming a perfectionist, creating an anxious personality, and robbing the child of the carefree existence they should have as a kid.\n\nAnd the biggest problem I've encountered is what I told my mom a few years ago, \" You had me acting in an adult capacity being responsible for your other kids before I was mature enough to be in that situation. However, you also wanted me to go back to a child's place at your convenience. It created an unhealthy dynamic in my personality because it was an unstable way for me to live. I was always the least in priority out of everyone.\"\n\nBecause they had more kids than they could adequately care for on their own, they sacrificed your childhood psyche on the altar of their and your brother's needs. They needed to be held accountable and told that you were damaged by their irresponsible behavior.\n\nETA: And I re-read what you said about not having any comfort from your family members and not being one to ask them for anything outside of those two instances. Moving out at 18. Same, sister, same. \n\nI realized about a decade ago that because of the way I was parentified that I don't trust my mother to ever take care of me because I saw that she was unreliable in the fact that I had to become the de facto parents to my brothers, so I became extremely independent and anxious. I also moved out for college because I never wanted to be forced to be the family caretaker ever again in life.", "NTA\n\nYou were given responsibility without the authority that makes responsibility effective.\n\nThat is a recipe for trauma. \n\nBeing volunteered as unpaid babysitter for your parents friends was wrong.\n\nYour parents imposed servitude on you -- you were made to do a task without the necessary authority or agency.\n\nYour parents were irresponsible.

He agreed to have one and we have been truly blessed. Now, I advise our son to think of only having enough children in the future that each parent can manage and financially support.

Your parents had the ability to make a different decision if they had too much responsibility, i.e. they could have stopped having kids earlier. In an age where infant mortality is way down and cost of living is way up and unstable and all the other things that make life hard today, having 5 is too many, and it will inevitably end in the parentification of at least one and the proportion is skewed female. It tends to be the oldest girl. \n\nWhat's more ridiculous about your situation is not being allowed to punish or parent for poor behaviour and then still being held responsible for it. Honestly, your parents weren't great. \n\nYour dad seems to be gaslighting you, and you are perfectly allowed to have whatever feelings you have towards them for this, and honestly, he's lucky that he's not catching a lot more shit from you for how he behaved.

You are not the problem.\n\nI recommend looking at what this means for your future instead of this interaction where you weren't the AH for being honest.\n\nFrom your dad's reaction, I suspect he expects you to care for your parents in old age.
