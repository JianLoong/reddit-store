They would always stay out about 3 hours late and I'd be home after midnight. Because of all of these things, I made a choice as an adult to never babysit ever again.\nI have severe anxiety that I've been in therapy for, coming from my teenage years due to balancing school, work, extracurriculars, and babysitting and feeling like I had no help or comfort in any of my family members.\nOn Christmas: the topic of kids and babysitting came up when someone asked  if birth order affected personality. There was some back and forth, but I said I think it does. When I was questioned about my reasoning, I just said that I had to be responsible in different ways than they had to.\nI was told I was being dramatic, then was pushed for more. I asked my youngest brother if he ever had to be responsible for younger siblings, and he, of course said no. I said that babysitting them put a lot of responsibility on me that I didn't consider appropriate for my age and maturity level, and that they'd never had to go through that. I also explained that I had to go without a lot of our parents' attention so they could have it (example: they missed my fencing tournaments and orchestra concerts to go watch my brothers' wrestling practices).\nAfter all of that, everyone was quiet, until my dad said,\n\"So you don't believe in family responsibility?\"\nI explained that I do, but that that there was a point where the amount of responsibility wasn't appropriate for one kid to handle. I also said that I don't think kids should be forced to babysit their siblings because it creates an unhealthy dynamic between them. My dad responded with,\n\"I didn't have to feed you or keep you in the house.\"\nI asked him what he thought would happen if he didn't do those things for me as a kid? He said,\n\"I'd have a skinny, cold kid.\"\nFor more context, aside from my wedding and $300 for rent one time, I never asked for anything from my parents after I left at 18. I thought about asking what he thought was his responsibility as a father, but I realized he wasn't taking me seriously, so I dropped the topic. I was told I was being ridiculous, and that I should let things from the past go.\nI'm wondering if I'm TA because my parents did need a lot of help with their kids growing up, especially with my special needs brother.

You were doing it frequently and for long periods of time. And they were often not available when problems arose. And getting handed over to their friends for free labor.  This is not a normal level of helping the family. \n\nI was the oldest of four. I had a friend who was the oldest of 9. And another who was 2nd oldest of 12. We all helped the younger kids. And did chores. But our parents were right there. And often older relatives like grandparents and aunts helped.  And if our parents went out occasionally, leaving us in charge, it was for a limited time and we were able to contact them with problems. When we babysitted other families, we were always paid. That was normal family responsibilities.\n\nYour father is gaslighting you as your words were truthful and he was looking bad to others.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your parents did to you was wrong. It's called parentification. Also, your father's mindset seems stuck somewhere in the middle of the 20th century regarding gender roles.

They'll never understand and they'll  never change.\n\nOh, and paragraphs are a thing for a reason ... LOL", "NTA.\n\nYou were parentified. It's a form of child abuse. It frequently happens to the oldest, often female child (but elder sons are not excluded). As you said so eloquently, it forces a different level of responsibility and maturity onto a child well before they are ready and creates an unhealthy dynamic between the siblings.\n\nIt sets different expectations for the siblings throughout their whole lives with the parentified child always expected to be mature, be self sacrificing, and to suffer 'for the good of the family'.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, your parents essentially 'pimped you out' to their friends to oversee their children.\n\nIt creates an unfair level of expectations onto the parentified child that plays out in becoming a perfectionist, creating an anxious personality, and robbing the child of the carefree existence they should have as a kid.\n\nAnd the biggest problem I've encountered is what I told my mom a few years ago, \" You had me acting in an adult capacity being responsible for your other kids before I was mature enough to be in that situation. However, you also wanted me to go back to a child's place at your convenience. It created an unhealthy dynamic in my personality because it was an unstable way for me to live. I was always the least in priority out of everyone.\"\n\nBecause they had more kids than they could adequately care for on their own, they sacrificed your childhood psyche on the altar of their and your brother's needs. They needed to be held accountable and told that you were damaged by their irresponsible behavior.\n\nETA: And I re-read what you said about not having any comfort from your family members and not being one to ask them for anything outside of those two instances. Moving out at 18. Same, sister, same. \n\nI realized about a decade ago that because of the way I was parentified that I don't trust my mother to ever take care of me because I saw that she was unreliable in the fact that I had to become the de facto parents to my brothers, so I became extremely independent and anxious. I also moved out for college because I never wanted to be forced to be the family caretaker ever again in life.", "NTA\n\nYou were given responsibility without the authority that makes responsibility effective.\n\nThat is a recipe for trauma. \n\nBeing volunteered as unpaid babysitter for your parents friends was wrong.\n\nYour parents imposed servitude on you -- you were made to do a task without the necessary authority or agency.\n\nYour parents were irresponsible.

He agreed to have one and we have been truly blessed. Now, I advise our son to think of only having enough children in the future that each parent can manage and financially support.

Your parents had the ability to make a different decision if they had too much responsibility, i.e. they could have stopped having kids earlier. In an age where infant mortality is way down and cost of living is way up and unstable and all the other things that make life hard today, having 5 is too many, and it will inevitably end in the parentification of at least one and the proportion is skewed female. It tends to be the oldest girl. \n\nWhat's more ridiculous about your situation is not being allowed to punish or parent for poor behaviour and then still being held responsible for it.

You are not the problem.\n\nI recommend looking at what this means for your future instead of this interaction where you weren't the AH for being honest.\n\nFrom your dad's reaction, I suspect he expects you to care for your parents in old age.

It\u2019s that simple. Don\u2019t have kids you can\u2019t take care off.", "I also don\u2019t think kids should babysit their siblings. A couple of hours every so often making sure one\u2019s reasonably competent sibling doesn\u2019t die is the maximum. \n\nKids do not respect their siblings in a way that makes any level of discipline or behaviour correction possible. It is also more responsibility than a kid can reasonably handle and it\u2019s irresponsible parenting to place your kids in situations that are beyond their abilities. \n\nNTA", "NTA. As the oldest of 5 kids, I have a strong feeling of where you are coming from. You were parentified, as was I. \n\nI also recognize the lack of attention aspect. My parents did not take part in a single one of my graduations. In fact I don't think they even knew when the graduations were. My mother is in her 90s now, and when I see that she has taken part in the graduations of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I can't bring myself to giving it as much as a like on FaceBook. \n\nThe concept of being responsible for my younger siblings' bad behaviour without having been given any means of disciplining them also rings a bell. All I had was a bag of obviously empty threats, which was obvious to my siblings as well.\n\nYour parents, like mine, did indeed need a lot of help with their children, but that is just because they chose to have more children than they could afford in a monetary sense as well as a physical and emotional sense.", "NTA. You and your dad need to sit down and talk about this. It\u2019s clear that you aren\u2019t on the same page. \n\nYou have clearly been to therapy and worked through a lot of this - kudos. Your dad has not. You\u2019ll have to walk him through it for him to see it like you. \n\nI went through a similar thing with my dad. I\u2019m the oldest and frankly we always have the most responsibility. It sucks. When I confronted my dad as an adult he cried and apologized. I felt awful but now we have a better relationship than ever.\n\nI don\u2019t know your dad. I hope he\u2019s at a point where he loves you and wants to hear you. It\u2019s not easy but I really felt a weight lifted after I explained to mine how I felt after everything growing up.", "NTA, though I think it might not be a bad idea to adjust your terms. Most people hear \"babysitting\" and think of just a couple hours here and there on rare occasions while the parents are out on some unusual task, and that doesn't sound like it fits your situation at all. What happened to you is more like a thing called parentification: they were constantly asking you to take charge in their place even under ordinary circumstances. And to add to that, they scapegoated you whenever the golden children did something wrong.\n\nI want to say I kind of get it. It sounds like your parents really needed respite care, and might not have even known that respite care is a thing. But you weren't trained to provide that, and didn't have the proper resources to do it anyway. They should not have placed this on you.", "NTA. What your parents did was parentification. And that was abuse.", "There's a difference between what happened with you, parentification, and the occasional ask of babysitting younger siblings that most older children end up doing.  \n\nMy oldest just turned 12, and I had her take the Red Cross babysitting and First Aid courses. I had to go to an appointment early and had her watch them for the 20 minutes until Grandma could get there.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were right.  Although sidenote, if he didn't provide those things child services would have taken you all away because there is a legal responsibility there.  They are also both TA for leaving you with no ability to discipline the boys.  I bet they wouldn't have don't it half much if you were a boy either.", "NTA. I was the parentified glass child, too, and I'd highly recommend learning more about both of those terms in order to continue healing. Plus, not all of that falls under \"family responsibility.\" Missing your events but going to your brothers' is clear favoritism and shows you that you were a lower priority (I had this happen too).", "NTA.\n\nAnd legally, he DID have to feed you and keep you in the house.  He would\u2019ve faced criminal charges if he didn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry your family did that to you \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94", "Nta\n\nHe actually is LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO FEED, CLOTH AND KEEP A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD, as your parent. So your father is just a stupid little old man that doesn't like to face the reality of his neglect.\n\nThe reality is that if they needed that much help with their kids, they shouldn't have that many.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI'm watching my own SIL do this to my niece. She's only 6 yo, with 3 yo and 1 yo siblings. Already from she was 4 yo SIL would praise her for carrying and taking care of her younger sibling (who doesn't weigh much less than herself!), to the point where he'd call his sister \"mom\" as well. All because SIL is lazy. She bragged about it as if it was a good thing, as she always does when she tries passing off something bad as something good. Both she and your dad *knows* they've done something bad, they just aren't at all sorry for it, it was a nice convenience to them. \n\nYour parents decided to get more kids. It was THEIR responsibility to take care of them AND you. If it happened a rare time that you were alone when you all were old enough that would be one thing, to do it in purpose as a strategy often is another. *Especially* when there's special needs involved. And then to blame you for their actions!!\n\nYour dad doesn't value you. Your value is only what you can do for him. He is an asshole and he is never going to apologise. Your pain and trauma is real and justified.", "NTA iv never had to baby sit anyone as a kid but iv known kids who had to .  Like my old baby sister forcing her 8yr old to baby sit her baby brother .. by baby sit I mean having him on her own out side in a cul-de-sac for hours,,,     situations like that and stories like yours are exactly why iv never forced my daughter who is 11 years older than my so to baby sit, iv asked her to watch him while I take a shower or to Nip to the shops but it has always been her choice and iv always given her money for helping out , I even gave her money when we got a puppy and I went to work even though she was home anyway", "NTA. Your parents are the ones who decided to have all those kids. The Yelp they needed was their own doing and it was NOT fair, appropriate, or anything else for you to be thrown into always watching your brothers. Also. Yes the fuck your dad did have to feed you and keep you in the house. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say b/c everything else will get me banned.", "I agree. OP's parents are awful", "In most jurisdictions in the USA, there is some amount of jail time and a pretty hefty fine  levied for proven parental neglect. \n\nSo yes indeed, OP's dad was required by law to provide for all his offspring, including OP. \n\nHe was doing what a lot of \"adults\" do when their shortcomings are exposed by \"children\" - defaulting to being snide and dismissive, hoping to shut down the embarrassing conversation.", "I would have replied in a mild tone, \u201cthe law disagrees\u201d. NTA", "Please also be extremely clear that you will not be the care taker of your special needs sibling when your parents are too old or pass away.  They have plenty of time to make other arrangements.\n\nNTA.  I'm so sorry they are so dismissive.", "It doesn\u2019t even sound like the op had parents. She had slave masters who made her raise her brothers.", "100% agree. I never understand why people can\u2019t figure out not to have more kids then they can afford to properly care for.\n\nFoisting the responsibility of the younger kids off on the older is NOT parenting. \n\nNTA- they perentified you, they made you responsible for their other kids because they were too lazy/Ill equipped to care for them. \n\nBabysitting a few times a week or something is one thing but they made you into another parent for the kids only without giving you any of the authority to enforce any rules.\n\nThey were crap parents.\n\nAlso your dads comments piss me off to no end \u2018I didn\u2019t have to take care of you.\u2019\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you didn\u2019t?\n\n\u2018I\u2019d have a skinny cold kid.\u2019\n\nOmg your dad is a gigantic jackass.\n\nFirst off; yes he did have to take care of you. That is what you agree to when you have a child and raise them.\n\nNext he wouldn\u2019t have a \u2018skinny, cold kid\u2019 he\u2019d have a visit from CPS and likely a record. \n\nI\u2019m hoping from the tone he was just being snarky but he sounds abysmal and I\u2019m truly sorry you got saddled with this for a parent.\n\nFamily responsibility is crap. You\u2019re not beholden to your parents. THEY chose to have children. You all were THEIR responsibility.\n\nYour responsibilities as a teen are do your chores (reasonable chores not hours of free labor/childcare) and keep up with your school work. That\u2019s it."]}
