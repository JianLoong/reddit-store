You definitely did the right thing here!\nSorry but your dad sounds very suspicious.", "NTA Your dad is asking you to do something potentially illegal and also damaging to you long term.

I'm thinking tax crimes because your father's request doesn't sit right with me. An uncle of yours has already declined to get involved, and I would investigate the reasons.", "NTA\n\nAlso, if you give in to this and it all goes wrong, you can say goodbye to your dreams of becoming a barrister.\n\nIt'll be your name on the records and you're not a minor anymore, so you'll be held responsible.

You're smart not to do that. You're 18 they can't do anything about. On the other hand, are you financially dependent on them? If so, you might start saving so you can attend uni to become a barrister.", "NTA. Do not mix money with him. It could destroy your life. There\u2019s a good reason he can\u2019t put it in his name and everyone else said no too.", "Absolutely not! There are a multitude of financial and legal responsibilities that come with owning a business. You would be responsible for all that since it is in your name. Plus if your dad\u2019s business didn\u2019t succeed and he occurred debts, you would be responsible for those, which could ruin your credit for years to come.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being selfish.

Nope nope nope don't go near that.", "Not sure of UK/Spanish laws, but also consider locking down your credit/ID. These multi businesses under too many names could be the tip of the iceberg.\n\nNTA.
