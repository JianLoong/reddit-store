Our 12 year old dog had to be put to sleep yesterday and we are both devastated. Today, my cousin is graduating from high school and I am getting our children, ages 4 and 3, ready to go to his graduation party. My husband decided that this was a good time to take a nap and leave me to get myself and the kids ready and also straighten up the house because we have let it fall into disarray the past few days while grieving for our dog. When I asked that he wait and take a nap after the party so that he can help me, he got upset that I'm not letting him \"sleep so that he can grieve\" and said that we have been cleaning all morning. It is actually me that has been cleaning the house while he sat and played video games with our 4 year old. He also slept in the morning and has been awake for a whopping 4 hours. I know that we are both upset and tired and that everyone grieves in their own way but I don't feel like I am wrong for expecting some help.

NTA", "NTA \n\nYour entire family is grieving so why does everything fall on you?", "NTA The problem  partly lies in expectations that are hiding in word choice. You write: \"So that he can help me\". With these words, you in fact state that it's your job to get the children ready and straighten up the house. While what you'd like is that you share responsibilities. You husband needs to get used to the fact that doing this kind of work is part of being a family. Try and communicate things these way to start and share the work between you in a more balanced way.  \n\n\nOf course, you're both grieving your dog, and your sadness is severe too. He needs to consider that.", "INFO : It would be great if your husband could tell us his side of the story because, truly, if he doesn't know the difference between \"we cleaned all morning, I need a nap so I can grieve\" and \"my wife woke up hours before me, minded the kids while I was asleep, cleaned the house while I was playing video games and now I need a nap\", honestly we're out of the AITA realm and deep into r\\relationships and \"emotional labor\" realm. \n\nBecause, you two might be grieving and individuals might grieve differently, but the kids still need to be minded by both their parents.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss...and that husband is using it as an excuse for his laziness.", "NTA. Your husband kinda sucks", "NTAp", "Hmm. We all process grief differently, but life must go on. YNTA. Being active will help relieve the anxiety and grief.", "I think emotions are running a little too high right now to turn to Reddit. You sound stressed, obviously.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the loss of the dog! \n\nMaybe you are trying to distract yourself with cleaning? IDK. \n\nTry to enjoy the party. It will help the kids focus on something other than the tension in the house.\n\nI have no judgement.", "NAH\n\nY\u2019all just had too much on your plate to deal with. I don\u2019t think either of you should be expected handle any of this well. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Be kind to one another & just do the best you can.\n\neta \u2014 I would rather spend my entire day playing games with my kids than cleaning anything or attending a graduation on the day after our dog passed. Your kids know Mom & Dad are not having a great time right now. They need adults to check in with them. If cleaning is something you need to do... stick your headphones on & clean your ass off. Your kids are fine with Dad. It was just a tough day. Probably nothing was going to help you feel any better. Take a deep breath & try again tomorrow.", "NAH. You are both grieving and raw right now. It's taking different forms and your husband might not be processing in a way that's helpful but, didn't you say it was only yesterday?  As long as the children are cared for cut yourselves some slack.  Me personally, I would have cancelled going to the grad- but that's just me. Emotionally I wouldn't have been able to put on a happy face at a celebratory event and would have felt guilty for being sad.  Essentially an immediate family member has died and for the next little while it's going to be a journey back to normalcy. Be kind to one another,  be kind to yourself too and I'm sorry for your loss.", "Gently, YTA. The house can stay messy for another few days. If it's too hard getting the kids ready for your cousin's graduation, could you skip the graduation? Your family has been through a trauma, and expecting everything to get back to normal on your timetable (and a short one, at that), isn't realistic. Very sorry about your pup.", "INFO: So playing video games with the 4 year old wasn't keeping the kid busy and out of your way?  It doesn't sound like people are coming over, so why does the house need to be clean NOW?", "NAH, I'm not sure what your specific situation is, but as someone who has struggled with mental health issues the death of my pet hit me very hard and it wasn't something I really knew how to recover fromm. it seems like to both really care about each other and your kids, I think being honest about what you're both feeling and making some compromises for both you sakes is the best plan.", "YTA.  I would agree that he could help you to get your kids ready but I do not understand the cleaning. You chose to clean the house - fair enough. But it was a choice not a requirement.  It could have waited for another day. So your husband is not off asking for a day to grieve.\n\nEDIT: Switch to NTA based on answer bellow", "So, your dog just passed away, and no one is coming over, and you have social obligations coming up?  All of that can be exhausting.  I get the frustration, but give the dude a day.  You should probably give yourself some time as well.  I think he gets a pass on the cleaning today.  But he should have been helping with the kids, too.  Maybe he needs to watch them so you can take a nap later, too.  ESH.", "I'm going with light YTA\n\nYour family member died. Worrying about the state of the house cleaning isn't important, even if people were coming over. which they are not. \n\nStop cleaning, chill on couch with husband and kids and play some video games with them. Skip the stupid party if it's too much. \n\nUnless something is leaking or on fire, your, and your husband's mental health is much more important right now. \n\nRight now, naps are beneficial, cleaning is harmful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So he gets to grieve while you get to take care of everything else? Sounds like he believes his grief is more important than your grief. Also appears like he's using that as an excuse to guilt trip you. He's being a selfish ass.", "NTA. \n\nBeing an adult and parent, sucks at times. The biggest way it sucks is when life is awful. You still need to get up and handle your responsibilities. You need to make money to have a roof over your head. You need to take care of your kids so they don't die or get taken away. \n\nSadly, grieving is a luxury when you have other responsibilities. It is entirely unfair for your husbamd to be able to grieve when you have to parent and adult for the both of you.", "When did we get to a place where anyone gets to tell anyone how to grieve a loss. This was going to just be a tough day for everyone.\n\nI need to play games with the kids & take a nap. I need to clean & attend a graduation. Both of those things can happen.\n\nETA \u2014 Personally, I find it ridiculous that anyone would or could judge these people. They both just suffered a loss. That just happened. They both deserve kindness.", "True but if the dog is 12 and the kids are under 5 and they were married a maximum of 5 years before kids (just guessing based on what is considered normal), it wasn\u2019t always \u201ctheir\u201d dog. Curious why she left off ages and who\u2019s dog it was first. Regardless a dog dying is a once every ten years or more event- not worth fighting over or holding a grudge when it\u2019s event that doesn\u2019t need a \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d so to speak. Argue for a day and then get over it unless it is somehow a huge pattern of behavior.", "He was playing the video games *with* the kid", "Honestly, I have never looked at him playing video games with the kids while I clean that way but you are right. He is helping and keeping them out of my way. Thank you. \nThe house doesn't have to be clean now, I would just like it to be because it's starting to get to me.", "I'm not asking him to clean. You're right, it is something that I am choosing to do. I'm just asking him to get himself and a kid ready while I get myself and a kid ready and finish my cleaning.", "They\u2019re *BOTH* grieving. He should help out.", ">This was going to just be a tough day for everyone.\n\nExactly, but OP's husband was considering only himself.  My comment is a little snarky, but also sincere.  I don't doubt that OP's husband is still grieving, but OP is too, and OP's husband is adding to her burden.", "She isn't cleaning and attending a graduation to grieve. She's doing those things because they need to get done.", "Totally the same as cleaning and getting the children ready, my bad.", "This is an important perspective. He was keeping them entertained.\n\nBUT it is equally important that in the regular, he doesn\u2019t get to do fun as a means to keep them busy while you do chores.\n\n50% of the time, YOU should be making happy memories with the kids and keeping them occupied while he cleans/does chores. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to play video games, but you could play board games or hide and seek, etc.\n\nBecause like with anything, you\u2019re teaching your children what to expect out of their future spouses. I would hate for that message to be that \u201cDad does the playing and Mom does the work.\u201d", "Cut that loophole shit out. If you need to clean to get your mind off of the dog then fine but don't try and come off as high and mighty that you're cleaning and he's in bed.", "I agree, which is why I said that he should help with the kids so she can rest, too.  I don't think it's unreasonable to have a day off from the cleaning to grieve, for both of them.  Losing their dog the day before, plus having to go be social at an event today sounds really exhausting.  If something needs to get deferred today, it should be the cleaning.  It will always be there.  The kids need to be tended to, but the cleaning can wait.  They both should take turns getting some rest today.", "No... OP is adding to her own burden. They both made choices. Her choices included her husband\u2019s participation. I don\u2019t see anywhere in this post that he actually agreed to participate. \u201cHey... are you up for cleaning & this graduation today?\u201d Nope, can we just play games & take a nap today? That\u2019s just communication.", "Um... that\u2019s not factual. She WANTED those things done. Cousin\u2019s Graduation happens with or without OP\u2019s participation & no one ever needs to clean until they actually choose to do that. Literally, nothing bad would happen if they both just decided to take a day off from the world. Hang with their kids, watch a movie, eat popcorn, take a nap & mourn their loss.\n\neta \u2014 is what it is but ... I don\u2019t think either of these people are assholes but I think I\u2019m biased because I probably wouldn\u2019t ever agree with anyone willingly bad mouthing their partner to the world during a very challenging time. No one is at their best.", "My point is that he was keeping the kids occupied and out the way - ie parenting them so OP had time to herself", "So if I weren't cleaning, should I be taking care of the kids while he lays in bed?", "Cleaning isn\u2019t a choice when you have small children. He is obligated to keep a clean home for his children just the same as she is.", "Time to herself so she can clean the house after being up all morning with the kids while he was sleeping? Indeed. It feels balanced, I didn't see it your way before.", ">My point is that he was keeping the kids occupied and out the way - ie parenting them so OP had time to herself\n\nPlaying video games with the kid is not parenting, my dude.  It's the least helpful option of keeping kids out of the way, leaving someone else to do most of the labor.", "You said you were doing that, and you wanted him to instead so you can clean. So yes, as you said you were doing you could have continued to do.", "I have 4 children.... I get it. No one is obligated to clean after we have suffered a loss.", "She chose to clean, the implication seems to be that it wasn't a deep clean but an organise because it was bothering her. I don't disagree he wasn't pulling his weight but equally it's not like he was gaming alone and neglecting to help in any way", "No, I said I was cleaning and getting kids ready while he laid in bed. I wanted him to take care of A kid and so that I can take care of A kid and still have time to finish cleaning. Even I weren't cleaning, he was still expecting me to take care of everyone while he slept. This is an ongoing issue that we have, not just a one time thing.", "Should add that to the post about the ongoing issue. \n\nHowever, you've stated multiple times the cleaning didn't have to get done but YOU wanted it done. Therefore, YOU just created an issue where there didn't need to be. If you hadn't wanted to clean then you would've been fine handling the kids. \n\nAnd on top of that, you and your husband clearly have a difference in how you grieve. If your husband needs time then that's fine. If you need to stay busy that's fine too. But by you trying to keep yourself busy and trying to make your husband get up, you're actively showing him \"I don't care how you feel right now\"."]}
