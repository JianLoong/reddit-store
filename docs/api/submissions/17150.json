Our 12 year old dog had to be put to sleep yesterday and we are both devastated. Today, my cousin is graduating from high school and I am getting our children, ages 4 and 3, ready to go to his graduation party. My husband decided that this was a good time to take a nap and leave me to get myself and the kids ready and also straighten up the house because we have let it fall into disarray the past few days while grieving for our dog. When I asked that he wait and take a nap after the party so that he can help me, he got upset that I'm not letting him \"sleep so that he can grieve\" and said that we have been cleaning all morning. It is actually me that has been cleaning the house while he sat and played video games with our 4 year old. He also slept in the morning and has been awake for a whopping 4 hours. I know that we are both upset and tired and that everyone grieves in their own way but I don't feel like I am wrong for expecting some help. So, am I the asshole or is he?\n\nEdit: \nI've been reading the comments and figured I would answer some questions. Our dog belonged to both of us. We have been together since high school and rescued him as soon as we moved in together. Also, I know going to a graduation party the day after sounds a bit ridiculous. I did not want to go but we have both been a mess this whole week leading up to yesterday and I feel bad for my kids. They have been very excited about this party and getting to see their cousins. I went so that they could have fun and get their minds off of everything. My kids are young and don't fully understand what has happened.

You write: \"So that he can help me\". With these words, you in fact state that it's your job to get the children ready and straighten up the house. While what you'd like is that you share responsibilities. You husband needs to get used to the fact that doing this kind of work is part of being a family.

It's taking different forms and your husband might not be processing in a way that's helpful but, didn't you say it was only yesterday?

I won't agree with them, I think taking a day to decompress after the death of a pet is important. I think the mom needs to also have that same time. Cleaning isn't important today.

I would say he entertained himself more than the child..", "To your children and wife includes helping maintain the household.", "You\u2019re right, let\u2019s talk about the kids.

He is letting down his partner when she\u2019s trying to do the right things for the kids and is therefore being an AH. It\u2019s really gross of you to try and turn this situation so that she\u2019s coming off as unsympathetic when her partner literally isn\u2019t contributing to helping with the kids. And no, playing video games with his four year is not pulling equal weight.\n\nShe\u2019s putting her family above her grief by contributing - he should be doing the same.

OP, in comments, even acknowledged that it's entertaining for the kids / helpful that the kid isn't underfoot.", "That was still only one kid. And when OP tried to get them all ready and clean the house he deemed it fit to take a nap"]}
