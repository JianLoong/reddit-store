So couple months ago she started to complain about her grade work being to easy and having to just sit without having anything to do until the rest of her classmates finished their work. I brought up these concerns with her teacher and she said she would look into what she could do about it. Turns out she decided to make my daughter help the kids who were falling behind after she finished her work. She started to complain about it to me and she really hates helping them because \"they are weird and they don't understand even after i explain it to them and I have to help them through it step by step\" her words.  \n\n\n  \nI sent a email to the teacher and she said she would take it into consideration. However nothing changed and I decided to take my concerns with her schools management and told them if they couldn't priorities my daughters learning then there were plenty of good private schools in the area that would. This got her teacher to back off and stop making her help the struggling students. However my wife is mad at me for this cause \"she knows how hard it is to be a teacher and they don't need parents making complaints to their bosses since they are already having a rough time\". I told her it was her choice to send her to public school( didn't want to send her to private school cause that would apparently teach her that she is better than people who cant afford the tuition. I wanted her to go to a nice private school since thats were I got my education and it was significantly better than the one year i spent in public school) and that if they couldn't do whats best for our kid I wasn't gonna just let it happen.  \n", "created_utc": 1702129888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ee1cd/aita_for_escalating_a_complaint_that_my_daughter/", "score": 3104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Calling a school principal \"management\" is odd. Then there's the reaction to your threat to send your kid to private school because she wasn't getting special treatment for being so much more academically advanced then all the other kids. Why would a public school with overworked teachers and crowded classes care if you removed one student? Wouldn't that be a relief to them? And finally,  it's odd that you're the one handling the situation when your wife used to be a teacher and would be better equipped to talk to them without pissing them off.", "NTA, students can be encouraged to help classmates, but ultimately if it goes beyond that then it\u2019s not acceptable. Your child is there to learn, and if she can\u2019t be moved to a higher class, she shouldn\u2019t essentially be tasked with being a teacher as consequence. Her teacher or the other teachers should give something else to do, even if it\u2019s just telling your child to read ahead in a textbook or do work for other class, or even read a book or do art in downtime. \n\nIf anything since she\u2019s hating it so much, your kid could start to fake having issues since she doesn\u2019t want to be forced to teach.

Basically, sounds like she's using your daughter as a buffer to make up where her ass is lacking in teaching. \n\nSome kids don't get the material, that's fine, but when you start forcing other kids to do your job for you, then you, as a teacher, are clearly lacking somewhere. Your wife, as a teacher, should recognize that too.\n\nYou should talk to the school about having your daughter moved to a higher grade. You never said how old she is, but if she's around high school age you could also potentially get her started on some college level courses too and get her some early credits. \n\nAlso, if she's old enough, it might be good to have *her* settle the public vs. private school debate you and your wife are having. No matter what you guys do for her now, it is *her* future and she should have a say in what happens to it.

It requires your child to understand what they have done inside and out to a degree in which they can explain it and model it in different ways to support others. This is actually a textbook extension activity in some cases. \n\n\nYou asked the school to provide extension for your child. They have provided it. Your wife is right if you had concerns you (and preferably your wife to as sheis more experiencedin this area) should have met with the teacher to discuss why she had chosen this task, why you were unhappy about it and what could be done next. \n\nYtA your threat to the school is exactly why your wife doesn't want your daughter going to private school.", "NTA.

I put my stepkids in private school as soon as I got the chance and I would have done anything for that opportunity when I was growing up, no matter the intellectual advantage. Maybe get your kid tested, and move her to the private school. The opportunities are wildly better, the teachers seem to enjoy their classes more and have more autonomy in teaching\u2026 in my experience, it became the better choice.", "Speaking as the smart kid who was forced to do the exact thing as a child, NTA.

Why can't she read a book quietly?", "You kinda sound awful, and it sounds like your turning your daughter into a snob. While I would like to point out that being able to teach something is probably the highest form of understanding something, so it\u2019s good for her to help others (plus you know, being a good person and all that), she shouldn\u2019t have to help other kids if she doesn\u2019t want to. For that reason, I\u2019d say NTA.", "We sent our advanced kid to a \u2018nice private school\u2019 and ran into the same problem. Please make sure the private school teachers know your thoughts on the situation before committing to them. \n\nAlso, NTA. Wife is. Your kid\u2019s education and intellectual satisfaction aren\u2019t tools to further her personal beliefs. \n\nSmart kiddos who are bored in school lose their curiosity rather quickly. Making her be an unpaid tutor is a great way to make your kid hate going to school.", "NTA I don't think it's the kid's job to teach other kids.", "What is wifh all these Y-T-A votes??? A teacher\u2019s job is to teach and the students are there to learn. She should be given extra work for enrichment or other activities to do, NOT turned into a teaching assistant because it makes the teacher\u2019s life easier! If this was a parent you\u2019d all be yelling about parentification and this is WORSE because this is what the teacher is getting paid to do. \n\nNTA, OP. You prioritized your child and her learning as you should, as her parent. The teacher had no business choosing this method to keep her occupied.", "NTA. I was your daughter in school and hated it. In around 7th grade I just started openly declining to assist any other student. Idc what all these other people are saying. If you think that its some kind of gift or opportunity for OP's daughter to be doing unpaid labor to teach other peoples children material that she has already clearly mastered, then you're delusional. No child would be enthusiastic about being the unpaid backup teacher all day for the whole year. Teaching is the teachers job. Its not ANY students job to assist them in that function. \n\nYou're a bit of TA for the private school threat, there were probably better ways of handling that. You're not TA though for prioritizing your child and not making her continue to do something she clearly does not want to do, is not required to do, and has literally no benefit at all to her. Not wanting to be the class tutor does not make your daughter some kind of elitist bully like the other commenters are saying.", "NTA - if your daughter is bored she should be in AP courses- I\u2019d definitely consider private school or something else so your daughter can advance her learning instead of having to read books quietly-", "NTA your responsibility is to your daughter and making sure she has a good education, not to the teacher", "Wow. You are TA. Schools is not only about academics, but about the social interactions. Imagine if you encouraged her what kind of leader she would grow into.", "NTA\n\nI was a teacher. Your daughter\u2019s teacher should have provided her with material that matched her level. Also, there is such a thing as peer to peer help but the teacher can\u2019t require your daughter to do that if she doesn't like it.", "YTA.  \n\nYour daughter thinks she is doing the teacher's job, but she really really is NOT.  She is proving that she knows the material by showing that she can explain it to different people.\n\nTeaching a skill is one of the best ways to learn it permanently.\n\nShould she be forced to do it?  No, but the teacher does not have a special lesson plan just for her.  She can entertain herself (read), help her classmates, or be bored.", "YTA big time.\nWhat a way to teach your daughter to be a self centered judgemental snob.\n\nThe teacher found a way to keep her engaged and support other kids. There were so many positive life lessons available for her here - patience, understanding, gratitude....\n\nNot to mention the potential positive impact on those other kids of them maybe finally understanding something because of the way your daughter explained it. The support they could have felt.\n\nBut no, instead you take the selfish, narrow view of it, and at the same time make trouble for a teacher just trying their best to support a room full of kids with different needs.\n\nYour entitlement and selfishness is very clear here and what's worse is you're teaching your daughter the same.", "NTA. The teacher should be differentiating her lessons so that ALL the students\u2019 needs are met.", "As a retired independent school teacher, I am confused by the statement that private schools teach students they are \"better than people who can't afford the tuition.\" At every school I worked at, from the most traditional to the most progressive, we consistently impressed on our students that they were very lucky to have access to educational resources others did not, and that they should take advantage of their good fortune to develop skills to best serve their community and the world.\n\nThat being said, I do think it's a problem to go to administration after a single email exchange. A face-to face meeting with the teacher in which you discuss the options that are available is a much better follow-up. An unfortunate side effect of the ill-conceived No Child Left Behind  policy (or what's left of it) is that it forces teachers to sideline capable students because they are penalized for every student who doesn't pass the tests, and there is only so much teachers can do. Also, it isn't much of a threat to say you're going to take your child out of the overcrowded public school system.", "YTA. It\u2019s not that your daughter HAS to help kids in her class, but it really sounds like she needs to do so in order to learn skills beyond rote academics. If she is the best in class and her explanation is that they are \u201cweird\u201d, she needs to work either on her social skills or on her language skills, or on both.", "NTA. I feel for your daughter. \n\nI was in the same spot as a kid and I'm still kind of bitter about it. I was there to learn, not share their workload.\n\nIt's part of the reason I don't like kids as an adult. I've already been forced to take care of too many that weren't mine.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter seems to have an opportunity to learn skills like empathy and communication, and knowledge transfer.  Also to develop her social skills.  You and your daughter should embrace the opportunity, and not escalate in the teacher.\n\nAlso, you have not fully committed to the joint decision to send your kids to public school and are using this situation to bring it up again in an \"I told you so\" manner.", "ESH. \n\nYou sound incredibly entitled. It\u2019s not a teacher\u2019s job to entertain your daughter, it is their job to teach. If your daughter finishes her work early then she needs to come up with a way to quietly entertain herself like reading a book. \n\nThreatening to take your child to private school just makes you sound pompous and self centered - no one cares if you move your kid to a different school. Don\u2019t take out your arguments with your wife about schooling on the school. \n\nHer teacher on the other hand should not be forcing her to help other students, putting that responsibility on her is not okay. It\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s getting frustrated. It was a completely inappropriate suggestion.", "NTA\n\nThe teacher shouldn't be forcing the gifted kids to act as a teacher's aides. If your kid finishes work early, then the teacher should let them read, or draw, or do puzzles until the end of class.", "YTA. I was the smartest kid in my class. The teacher did the same thing to me. Guess what? Learning how to teach others helped me immensely with my own studies. It\u2019s like a form of revision to help reinforce the concepts I previously learnt. And by having to break it down into simpler steps for my classmates, it helped me better understand the material too. It also helps teach empathy for students who are not so gifted academically, who also tend to be from lower socio economic backgrounds. \n\nThere\u2019s more to life than academics. Your wife wants to raise your daughter to be more down to earth, not like pretentious private school kids.", "NTA. Drives me crazy how smart, gifted girls are not given the resources they need, and instead, are expected to \"nurture\" other students. Screw that. It's the teacher's job to teach, it's the students job to learn. It's not your daughter's job to academically catch up other students. There is a disconnect here.", "NTA and people who are saying Y T A are T A themselves , you can\u2019t expect another child to do a teachers job the teacher is lazy and is throwing around her responsibilities on a student , yes it\u2019s a public school so she probably doesn\u2019t have the extra resources but that does not mean she can\u2019t communicate and inform you in regards to the same", "NTA and stop messing around and get the kid to a real school. She's wasting time and energy at the public schools.", "If she likes reading, have her read a book when she is finished. Reading is always a good thing and it is not disruptive at all. I was in a gifted program and we were all encouraged to read when finished or having quiet time in class. We all finished at different times and no one thought anything about a classmate pulling out a book to read.", "This happened to my daughter in middle school (public). She was in the gifted program, but that was set up like a class in itself, and she still had regular classes. By 8th grade they didn't know what to do with her, so she had 4 study halls and tutored kids in her regular classes. The middle school and high school were all in the same place, and we knew nothing would change,  so for high school we had her apply to an international baccalaureate program, where she thrived. I never understood why the middle school didn't send the kids who were ahead to upper school classes. When I was in my first elementary school (1st-3rd grade), I was sent to English and Math classes two grades above my level. At my next school each grade had two different classes for English and Math,   where more advanced students had a separate class from the others.", "YTA.  Teaching content to other people is actually an excellent way to reinforce and deepens a student\u2019s understanding of the content, and improve other important communication and leadership skills.  Your daughter may be missing out on a valuable educational opportunity because you are too narrow-minded to understand it. \n\nOn the flip side, your wife\u2019s concern about your daughter being taught she\u2019s better than other people is probably moot since she seems to be getting that lesson pretty well at home.", "You\u2019re a lot and prob TA. \n\nThreatening the public school to take your kid out?  \nNo one cares,  you don\u2019t pay tuition. \n\nYou could have gone back to the teacher and said you\u2019d file a complaint if it didn\u2019t stop. \n\nWhy not ask to skip a grade?", "NTA but your wife is. \n\nShe is lowering the chances for your daughter to succeed because of some bs political view\u2026 the difference between public and private schools CAN be alarming. \n\nYour daughter will most likely lose motivation and drive in the public school. She\u2019ll be the best in class because others are much slower but if she was in a more demanding school, she probably would have to work harder. So basically, you\u2019ll teach her to slack because now she doesn\u2019t have to put in any effort to compete with the other kids (certain amount of competition is beneficial and healthy). \n\nPlease for your daughter\u2019s sake, have a chat with your wife and consider relocating her to a private school or at least skip a grade so that she is surrounded with some kids more on her mental level.", "\"they are weird and they don't understand even after i explain it to them and I have to help them through it step by step\"  \n\n\nIt seems like your child could do with a few lessons in empathy...", "YTA and you are in fact reaching your daughter that she\u2019s better than others. Yo ur daughter already can\u2019t work with peers she believes are below her academically. What is she going to do during group projects? Students being able to explain or reteach something is the top tier of learning. Your kid needs improved social skills. It\u2019s okay to not be comfortable doing it every day but your kid doesn\u2019t want to work with people because they\u2019re \u201cweird\u201d and don\u2019t understand. Her life is going to be pretty hard if she expects to never work with people who are weird or don\u2019t understand something.", "NTA your daughter not the teacher she comes to school to learn not to help others students. Should consider move her to better school.", "NTA and why in the world does your wife not want your daughter to get the best education she can?  She wants her kept back in some kind of social justice, virtue signaling act?  How about wife give of HER time to tutor kids who are falling behind then instead of making her daughter endure a sub-par public education?", "YTA. If your daughter wanted it easy she should have just brought a book or some Sudoku or word problems. You created more work for a teacher, complained about her solution, and then escalated it when it wasn\u2019t immediately rectified. \n\nAlso, teaching the struggling students is an excellent way to help hammer the information in. We had a woefully underprepared Physics teacher my senior year in high school. Small school, guy who had done it for years retired, and the girl they brought in was straight out of college and has taken one physics class. Me and two other guys ended up pretty much teaching the class, getting together the night before to work through the next chapter. It was a struggle, but in college I got the top grades in both semesters of physics I had to take for my degree. \n\nYou created this problem. You asked the teacher to come up with a solution, and then you didn\u2019t like the result. Instead of pushing this up the chain and possibly getting her in trouble, you and/or daughter needed to come up with your own solution and present that to the teacher.", "Like just...in general, YTA.\n\nI get caring about your daughter's education and development. But you know what's just as important as her learning how to do math? How to deal with people. Compassion. Generosity. Helping others.\n\nDo I think there is a line where \"too much\" priority could placed on her helping? Absolutely. But your framing and handling of this absolutely reeks of selfish entitlement, and now instead of learning how to be a compassionate human being, your daughter will likely learn from you. \n\nSo yeah, my vote is on YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter complains so the teacher came up with a solution,  and then you and your daughter weren't happy about that either.  \n\nNewsflash...public school teacher don't have the time to come up with individual lessons for each student.  They teach for a classroom of kids, often to the lowest common denominator.  If your daughter can't find something constructive to do for the 20 minutes the teacher is occupied helping the other students,  that's o you and her. Helping the others was a good solution.  \n\nAnd rather than complain about the teacher, move your daughter to a more challenging school or see if she's eligible to skip a grade.", "I see where your daughter gets it from. You\u2019re also not doing her any favors. Former special gifted child goes off to college and realizes they\u2019re no longer the smartest person in every room and they have to actually work to keep up, follows huge mental breakdown. Oldest tale in the book. YTA", "NTA imo I don\u2019t know if they can force her to tutor the others, but what I don\u2019t understand is why your daughter can\u2019t rest, read, draw or catch up on other classes if she\u2019s done early? That\u2019s what I used to do. I was in a few classes where I had a lot of extra time because I was doing well so I just used that time to do other things quietly.", "YTA\n\nI was your daughter in school. I was asked to help teach other students when I breezed through work. Before I started, I was a entitled little bitch who was annoyed when \u201cidiots\u201d would talk to me. Now, my entire job revolves around kindly teaching people about things I have expertise in, and that they have zero experience with. It taught me an incredibly valuable lesson in communication, helped adjust my attitude towards those who weren\u2019t as advanced as I was, and helped me a lot socially. It also proves mastery over a subject, and helps cement it into your head. It\u2019s why teachers have you give presentations. If you can effectively teach the idea to others, you\u2019ve proven that you completely understand it yourself.\n\nAlso, this is something that students have been doing in classes for\u2026well, always. You didn\u2019t like that your daughter didn\u2019t have anything to do, and once she was given something to do that actually involved her education, you complained. Just give her a book to read in class, then. I had teachers who would excuse me to the library after I finished my work, I had teachers who would let me leave to other classes, I\u2019d work on other subjects. I was evaluated and marked as a \u201cGifted\u201d student, so this was my entire educational experience. \n\nIt made me so much more empathetic and patient with other people. Do I still think the average person is stupid? Yes, because I work with the public and know the average person is. Do I treat every single person I meet like they\u2019re stupid? No. It seems like your daughter could use the experience, if she thinks needing step-by-step help is a serious issue. In fact, it seems like her only issue is that they\u2019re weird and not as quick to pick things up as her, which is much less a \u201cIM BEING FORCED TO WORK\u201d issue and much more of a \u201cI THINK IM BETTER THAN THEM\u201d issue. Which going to a private school would make significantly worse. She needs the attitude adjustment, just like I did.", "Kids go to school not just to learn math and ABCs, they also develop social skills and learn how to navigate life. Dealing with weird people who just don\u2019t get it, better she learn these skills now unless she plans to live in a bubble forever.", "YTA.  While you may have gotten a better book-learning at your private school, you didn't get much of an 'education':  your elitism & snobbery shines through like a 1kw bulb.  Your daughter is already well on her way to being 'stuck up'.  There is nothing wrong with using your spare time, if you have already mastered the subject, in helping others:  it's like volunteering, and teaches things like acceptance of diversity and altruism, two things which are sorely lacking in today's society, as well as life skills that will help your daughter in the long run.\n\nYour wife is on the right track.", "YTA, you got what you asked for, but still complain, and when things aren\u2019t going your way, you went over the teacher\u2019s head and complain to the boss. Teachers have it hard already without entitle parents complaining.", "YTA, sorry. You're not wrong to want your daughter to have better opportunities, but you can't expect the teacher to individually work out a special situation just for her when she has dozens of students to care for. If your daughter doesn't want to tutor (which is one of the best ways for cementing knowledge in her own mind), fine. But maybe make good on your threat and put her in a more rigorous school, or find an honors program or some extracurriculars if you're not happy with this one because it's unreasonable to expect the already stretched thin teacher to provide separate studies/teaching for one child.", "Your daughter already thinks she\u2019s superior to her classmates now. Neither of you seem aware that not only do you do your studies, but learn social interactions too, so you don\u2019t say or do weird things that make you look like an AH. YTA.", "OK so I'm conflicted, because the exact same thing happened to me from kindergarten up until about the fifth grade (in the 80s).\n\nYes, it was very annoying sometimes, but it also taught me other lessons like patience and how to simplify explanations so people could understand.  Yes, that is the teacher's job, but it's not like public schools have improved in the last 40 years, so I'm sure that teacher is stretched beyond her limit.\n\nI think some compromise is in order here.  You didn't say how old your daughter was, but I'm guessing 3rd or 4th grade.  Her teachers need to find her some enrichment activities that she can do some of the time (advanced coursework on her own).  That should limit the \"boredom downtime.\"  If you want to push it, you could get her a special education IEP since gifted/talented is part of special education as well.

There are some subjects this approach lends itself to better than others, but I think your daughter and you missed an opportunity here, especially since your daughter wanted to be challenged. No, it's not your daughter's responsibility to help others in the class, but this is quite honestly a great hack for an advanced, bored student.

Most classroom now are filled with students who range in ability from 2 years below the grade expectations (or more) to 2 years above the grade. Teachers (good ones) are already trying to teach accommodate these gaps and support students who do not qualify for additional in school support.\n\n The best thing you could do for you daughters education would be to complain to your state government or ministry (this is what we have in Canada) and explain how class complexity and large class sizes are making it impossible for your daughter to receive the education she deserves that you pay taxes for.", "YTA.

In a couple of classes I was sat next to a couple students who needed help, and I didn't mind it too much to begin with because I was sort of friends with them. But that had its own problems, since it effected my relationships with them when I told them I couldn't help them more than I already was, otherwise I'd just be doing it for them.

They definitely need socialization and training, but they need it with intellectual peers, which is why programs like Gate or other advanced programs.

My coworker responded, \"That's fine, but why won't my daughter have also moved?\"  \n\n\nI have no idea if this guys daughter is a good student by training, intellect, or temperament (probably a combination of all three like most good students), but if she is more advanced than her class, she needs to be challenged.

The teacher is not wrong however once it was clear the OP's child did not want to fill a tutor role other options should now be explored to keep her engaged with the material.

So now this child, who evidently struggles to communicate effectively with similar aged children - such that she calls her own peers \"weird\", will now neglect those important social and communication skills a little more.", "This was my thought immediately. The teacher came up with a good solution but the dad has too narrow a view of what it means to get an education.

I just understood and learned things really easily and quickly compared to the rest, but because of that I had no clue how to teach them in a way that they could also understand it. Thankfully that changed for me when I went to a better and more challenging school and I finally had to put in actual effort at that point in order to keep up.\n\nDue to that (especially the part where she struggles to understand the struggling students) it sounds to me like her current school simply isn't challenging enough for her, and that can be very detrimental in the long run. The mentioned private school could very well be the right solution.", "EDIT: forgot to add, this is coming from someone whose school tried this on me in ninth grade. It was horrible.\n\nThat janitor comparison is inherently dishonest and manipulative. You sound like you have weird personal issues that you are projecting onto a child who doesn't want to be placed into a difficult and uncomfortable situation.\n\nThis is basically a gross and weird school version of parentification. It's not her responsibility to educate her peers. Instead of moving her up a grade or providing her new lessons, she's being turned into a teacher's assistant with students that she is uncomfortable around.\n\nThis DOES take away from her, when she is being forced into a role she lacks the maturity, authority, or training or experience to fulfill.\n\nGiven her discomfort and the awkwardness, she is likely to end up being bullied or even abused by both peers and teachers for them, used as a scapegoat if the peers shes is being forced to help and teach fail. I've seen it happen.\n\nAlso, weird kids exist. Weird gross kids that sexually harass and assault, good off or come to class high or who have learning disabilities that schools pretend don't exist until a \"situation\" comes up they are FORCED to acknowledge and then attempt to sweep under the rug. \n\nIf she's willing to say outright the kids are weird, she's probably being forced to try to work with students that the teacher themselves feel uncomfortable dealing with. I went to school with kids that commented on breasts, talked about sex with anime girls, or wouldn't shut up about how they wanted to smoke weed, or would do that weird competitive lying about obviously fake things to try to impress and look cool. It was extremely uncomfortable. Schools don't protect kids and they don't care about teachers enlugh to have smaller classes or actively work with students sho are falling behind or who may have disabilities or are.. honestly.. just \"weird\".\n\nThe daughter won't \"learn\" anything valuable socially or educationally, what she WILL learn is that her needs and comfort are easily sacrificed and that she \"owes\" others her time, presence, and effort, regardless of the detriment it has on her.\n\nThis is a form of parentification disguised as a weird attempt at validating an adult's personal ideaology. \n\nIf the mother cares more about protecting another teacher simply because they are a teacher, than she does her own daughter's education and needs, she is a bad mother AND likely a bad teacher. \n\nIf her mother cares less about her daughter moving up a grade or being placed into an AP class, and would rather she stagnate just to throw a bone to a fellow teacher.. the mother is being unfair and sacrificing her daughter's future and feelings and agency to validate her own personal beliefs and try to do that weird things insecure or grudge-holding adults do where they want to rectify what they experienced as a percieve injustice, by forcing others in an unrelated situation to play things out the \"right way\". Like when you see parents force their kids into beauty pageants or military training or whatever because they, personally, wanted or lost an opportunity, and now it's the child's job/destiny to complete the task regardless of the child's needs, interests, or feelings.\n\nPrivate school is not bad. Public schools enable and neglect students constantly and bullying, sexual harassment, and neglect runs rampant. If a parent has the means to do better for their kid, doing so is not elitism. It is doing their job as a parent to give their kid the best they can because they are building the rest of their child's life. \n\nWould you refuse to buy your child properly fitting clothes, or give them the best medical care you can, because some kids don't have that, just so they can \"learn to not be snobs\"? She's a kid. She has needs. You don't force your kid to weird sirty clothes, lop their hair off, sexually assault them, medically neglect them, or withhold their own ingellectual advancement on the sole basis of \"well someone else doesn't have it as good as you, so you need to stay on THEIR level so you can LEARN.\"\n\nThat logic holds no water in ANY other area for OBVIOUS reasons. Withholding a better education for her just to punish her for being more advanced than unfortunate peers.. is just as nonsensical. Especially once you throw in the spiteful ideaology that her success somehow inherently makes her a bad person who must sacrifice for others.

Is your daughter actually gifted or is she just ahead of the class and had your wife not been tutoring her she would have been on target.\n\nThe truth is private school may not be a better fit for her. In any case, a lot of people choose to keep their kids in public school and get additional tutoring outside of school to help expand on concepts. The expansion part is key here because if she's just doing the work that the class is going to be doing in a couple of weeks of course she's going to be bored but if she's expanding on the practical uses of geometry while the class is learning about finding the areas of triangles then that can be enriching for her even if she stays in a public school environment.\n\nETA: but if she isn't finding it meaningful to tutor her peers then just empower your daughter to say to the teacher, respectfully, no thank you. I used to just sit in class and read when I finished my classwork ahead of my peers.", "when I taught at a private school, it was a freaking FIGHT to give a kid a C on one test. No students were getting challenged because their parents were paying for a diploma, not an education", "It's more that most the kids in private school are there because their parents don't want them interacting with the filthy inferior poors and/or wrong religions and that's what your kid internalizes. And then you get people who act like OP, and the mother of this girl clearly sees the effect his attitude is having and doesn't want the entire peer group of her kid to be smaller versions of her dad. There's a reason OP intentionally l cut his wife out of the discussion and it's because he's used to getting his way and she's not having it.", "Given ''hitting your kids is unacceptable'' is still *debated* by some folks today, yeah, no hope the majority of people are going to be onboard with the idea of a non-physical 'invisible' form of abuse.", "Yeah my private school taught me that people coexisted with dinosaurs. I was so far behind in math and science when I finally got to public school that I never caught up. :(", "I tutor but I\u2019m considering ending that because too many kids don\u2019t want to be there. You cannot force a kid to learn. The teacher\u2019s approach made sense at first, but it\u2019s past time to end it. Schools don\u2019t give two sh\\*\\*ts about gifted kids. I agree that you should get her elsewhere.", "That's a very good point. A lot of kids receive tutoring every day and they still cannot keep up. Either way really does not matter. The fact is she is way ahead and not being challenged.", "Because she called them \"weird\" for not understanding a concept as quickly as she does.", "Oh my God. Helping others is such an awful skill. We have to be forced to do it. How dare they make students care about others and their success.", "academically, maybe, but it sounds like she doesn't get along with her peers due to her superiority complex, so maybe not so much socially.\n\nI was in the same boat except I didn't have tutors at home, I just had parents that encouraged the pursuit of learning at all times. but I was leagues ahead of almost everyone else in school. I treated my classmates like idiots because of it, and few of them liked me very much.\n\nI wouldn't be shocked if that's what is happening here, moreso than the daughter being upset about having to teach. she (and her father) think she is more valuable than the other kids, and she should go to private school to rise above the rabble.\n\nmom sounds like she has noticed this haughty attitude and is refusing to move her to a private school to try to temper it.", "I'm in the #2 camp, personally, especially if you can afford private school.\n\nUnfortunately, as a very gifted *low income* student, I ended up with #1.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the primary motivator for most parents at all.

Where I'm from its called extension and its usually just teaching the next year's content", "I went to a public school where pretty much everyone's parents had a college education and white collar jobs. As a group, the entire town was pretty much gifted as we all expected to go to college and all had a huge step up in education by having such families. IQ tests and other achievement tests are biased towards such children.\n\nSo, having parents who both are college educated with one being a former teacher means the daughter will most probably fall into a gifted program - barring learning disabilities (in which they can still be gifted, but they have a more comples job learning).", "The fact that the daughter is even interested in learning this stuff ahead of time speaks for a lot. Maybe she\u2019d be at the level of the other students if her mom wasn\u2019t pushing her ahead, but that combined with her apparent frustration at not having anything challenging to do in school make me think she\u2019d probably do better with more challenges, regardless. If she was just trying to get out of doing anything else in class and enjoying her extra time there that comes from the help her mom gave, I\u2019d be with you, but it looks extremely likely she\u2019d benefit from more rigorous schooling.", "Has OP said anywhere that Mom is teaching the daughter things ahead of time?

Not a student who is in need of extra work not being a tutor.", "Has the daughter been taught how to be a tutor? It's all nice and good to think that assisting other students will help the good/clever student, but it is *far* more likely, at the elementary school level, to inculcate resentment (quite likely on both sides) as well as actively harming the slower student when the more clever student, out of sheer frustration, just gives the answers and tells the other student to write down the answers. Worksheet finished, but slower student has no more clue how to get it done than before. That is the reality of it, not the pie-in-the-sky idea that a more clever student will gain anything from re-hashing the same material by trying to assist someone else.", "I love how hard you are fighting this corner. As a very high achieving person in both my academic and professional lives I couldn\u2019t agree with you more.

Not a one time thing. That\u2019s the issue.

I hate that parents are shamed for wanting the best academically for their kids. Be it private school, enrichment programs, Charter Schools, whatever. it is not OP's daughter's job to tutor another kid when she is bored.

Well stuff Id consider the bare minimum.", "I would read. Then, I got told my reading was \u201cdistracting\u201d to the other students and I might be reading inappropriate things or cheating (it was one of the Twilight books? This was in middle school). The cheating thing didn\u2019t make sense to me - I\u2019d already turned in my work! \n\nBut I offered for him to look through my books if he wanted to ensure the material was appropriate for school-grounds and not full of answers scribbled in the margins like he was imagining. Instead, he decided to blanket ban reading after work was finished. I asked if I could do my work from other classes then. Request denied. He really was determined for my only options to be finish with everyone else or stare at the wall.\n\nIt definitely felt like a punishment for finishing early. And people wonder why my enthusiasm for academics started to die in middle school\u2026", "They knew if they didn't let me read when I was done I would make trouble. This started in first grade. No one ever thought to get me more challenging material. The 90s were a time.", "I could not agree more. Happened to me throughout middle school.

No recourse for academically advanced students.", "Wow I feel this.  **Why do people on this thread assume teachers will let you sit and read quietly when you finish work quickly?** \n\n\nI learned very early on how to hide reading under my desk so I didn\u2019t just stare at a wall for large chunks of time.  Some noticed and ignored it, while others would force me to put it away.  [ETA: the teacher will always notice at some point no matter how well you hide it.]\n\n\nFurthermore, I remember my friends could pick the seat they wanted, but I was always next to the kid who struggled the most.  That alone was enough to make me resent being VOLUN-TOLD to tutor.\n\n\nETA: the kid being unofficially tutored knows what\u2019s up and may resent the student forced to teach.  I really tried because I knew I was lucky not having to struggle.  Some were appreciative, but more often they were rude or made fun of me.  It felt like punishment and a lose-lose situation for both students.", "I had a teacher like that once. The learned Very Quickly that the last thing they wanted was my undivided attention.   After that incident I never had problems with reading fiction in class unless it was a sub.", "It's a power play and an ego trip for some teachers, unfortunately something I've seen more among male teachers.  \nI used to put up an assignment or pass out a worksheet for the kids who finished early.

So during the day I was too tired to even get through \"Brown Bear Brown Bear.\" He's now 2 months old and I've managed to get to the point where I'm reading to him most days. \n\nMy point is, give yourself grace if it doesn't go as planned. Congrats on your pregnancy!", "YTA. And, uh, since you don't know the difference between priorities and prioritize, nor that gonna isn't actually a word, I'm going to say that private school you went was a huge waste of money.", "Gotta be careful with taking books to read after the work is finished.\n\nI did this when I was in school. For some ungodly reason, it really pissed off some of my teachers. Some assumed I half-assed my work so I could read. Some assumed I didn't do any of the work at all. Even when they saw for themselves that my work was finished, and done correctly, they were still angry and told me I should just sit there quietly (and stare at a wall I guess?) Some threatened to take my books away (but they never did. I think they knew that would be a big mistake.) Almost two decades later, I still don't understand why it agitated them so.\n\nBy all means, take books to read, but be prepared to put them away if the teacher gets a bug up their ass.", "Every kid a public school loses reduces their funding.

Getting students to help each other is one of the things my school's administration has really been pushing us to do, and there's a huge amount of benefits to it.\n\nCan it be implemented badly?  Sure, anything can, but I don't trust a guy who's so dismissive of public education.  He's one of those people who thinks that students are \"customers\" and that \"the customer is always right\", which is super-annoying.", "Thank you!!! I was a gifted kid that had to tutor other students when I finished my own work - it was a HUGE learning opportunity and really beneficial! Being able to not just do something, but explain *why* it's the thing to do, and be able to explain something in multiple ways - this is a true challenge and a true test of intelligence.\n\nI went to only public school when young, got a full scholarship to a private university, and then grad school at Stanford. Private school is not a necessity for smart and driven students.

OPs kid found the coursework to easy, so the solution is to make her a TEACHER'S AID with no pay as another student? What the fuck kind of wrong thinking do you have? It isn't another student's job to cover the teachers fucking workload. If the teacher is having a hard time, maybe she should get an actual fucking assistant instead of another fucking student who isn't fucking qualified to teach the fucking class, much less take upon the teacher's fucking responsibility as again: SHE IS NOT THE FUCKING TEACHER AND ISN'T FUCKING RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER STUDENTS KNOWING/LEARNING/ABSORBING the material. She's a fucking STUDENT. A STUDENT who was told to do a fucking teacher's job that she isn't fucking qualified nor responsible to fucking do. Get your head out of your ass.", "who puts in the effort to be grammatically correct in a social media post. If you have nothing better to do than critique someones spelling on reddit then thats a you problem", "Excellent point. The student being forced to teach is NOT trained to teach. They don't know different ways to explain a concept or other teachings methods. And they can miss things - such as your dyslexia - because they aren't trained to notice it or know what it means. \n\nAs others have mentioned, sometimes we just 'get' a concept or a subject but that doesn't mean we KNOW how teach someone else. I almost always remember how to get somewhere even if I've only been there once but I can rarely explain the route/directions to any one else.", "Oh I know. My parents had to go to the school over me and books because of similar things. You\u2019d think teachers would want you to read. It\u2019s a shame.", "Oh I understand the issues teachers face well since I worked in a school that had literally all of them for several years. Which is why I said I understand how not every student will understand the material. That's an impossible goal, unfortunately.\n\nHowever, that's also why teachers like that bother me so much. Issues of funding and class size are the responsibility of the school and the advanced children should not be forced into teaching to accommodate this (emphasis on *forced* since, as you mentioned, some kids actually enjoy it). It's basically punishing them for understanding the material.\n\nAs for the children with special needs (diagnosed or undiagnosed) that is even *more* of a reason not to force a child to teach them. These children are already in need of accommodation the school is apparently not providing, and having another student their age trying to do what even an adult cannot will not help them and may even have a negative result since sometimes children (someone mentioned the daughter is 12 so this is middle school basically) at that age already have trouble regulating their emotions. It could lead to outburst which in some instances may or may not be violent (my proof? I've been stabbed with a pencil before by more than one of such cases). And worst yet, it will build a resentment in the daughter for these children that may carry over and become a bias/prejudice into adulthood.\n\nSo yes, there are benefits to peer teaching, but only if everyone agrees to it. The teacher was asked to stop and didn't. This is why I'm calling her selfish and saying her teaching is lacking. Letting the girl not teach required zero effort on her part, it would have been exactly like it was before she started doing it. But she didn't have her stop. Why? Because having another child teach these children made her life easier and she didn't want to. And as soon as you put your own convenience over the benefit of the children, your performance as a teacher is lacking imo.\n\nBut that's just my two cents, of course.", "I could have skipped a grade as it was an option, but I was in a school that had just started combination classes so I was already with the grade above me so I didn\u2019t see the difference. I was bullied a lot for being different, and it turned into a whole ass ordeal where I ended up moving schools. I was still in a class by myself, but the school was a lot better.", "> No. The teacher found a way to keep her busy and silent.

They have neurodivergence and need to be catered for through an IEP to support their strengths and weaknesses. When I was in uni learning about this difference and how it was diagnosed was part of what we looked at when learning about additional learning needs. \n\nA gifted child is not always top of the class. In over a decade working as a teacher I have had 2 children who we have discussed maybe sending for giftedness assessment - i have taught many very very bright kids who were advanced but only two we looked at this with. Their parents never ended up exploring this to my knowledge. One was very talented academically, a typical gifted child who mastered things with ease despite a lack of effort. The other had major behavioural issues - one of my top 2 work avoiders I've ever taught. But despite this, managed to maintain the expected standards. This is something we know is not uncommon either - kids who act out and don't achieve their potential - their symptoms can often be confused with adhd leading to misdiagnosis or in some cases a dual diagnosis. \n\nAmerica over uses the term when they just mean smart kids. Most places understand it is a neuro divergence and academic settings ensure it's used accurately about the very rare children it actually applies to. \nUsing the term gifted to describe your child without seeking the assessment and support of those trained to assess this isn't helpful.
