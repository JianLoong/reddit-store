When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.\n\nWe didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.\n\nSo my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.\n\nI visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is \u00a3500k and she needs a \u00a3150k deposit. She has \u00a3100k so far. \u00a325k on her own, \u00a325k from her mum and \u00a350k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra \u00a350k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.\n\nI said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave \u00a310k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back \"like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?\"\n\nEveryone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.\n\nMy mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about.

If he brings it up again tell him he's welcome to use all the money he saved excluding you and your brother from the family on his daughter's house. He is an entitled asshole and honestly your mom is an asshole too for allowing her own children to be subjected to that unfairness.\n\nFor what's it's worth, my dad remarried when I was 11 and my stepsister is a year older. My dad and stepmom, even though my dad made much more money, ensured that the two of us girls got everything the other did.

Just wow. \n\nBut hey, good on you that you two became successful enough for him to ask for money that you could say no to! Living well truly is the best revenge!", "NTA. He needs to know how badly he screwed up. And he didn't do anything to try and make up for it either, did he? Nope. Not until he wanted YOUR money for HIS kid that bullied you. Nope.

You don't want for money, and I am not sure what kind of genuine relationship he could foster with you after so long when his guilt is coming out now that he wants something from you.\n\nI think both step dad and mother failed you here.  I can't imagine having step children and leaving them out while taking their mother and my bio children, or knowing that they are doing without due to an income disparity. It sounds like he *could* have given you and your brother a better childhood but didn't want to.

They don't sound very sorry just inconvenienced.  Don't give them a cent.", " Clearly NTA. The audacity of his asking, insisting and expressing regret but no apology is quite something. \n\nHe even had a chance to revisit the equal contributions more recently when you and Luke bought your houses, to give you both help with the down payment, but stuck with his original program. So it\u2019s extremely disingenuous to say he would have done it differently if even now he has made no attempt to do so, and just brings it up after pressuring you for $$. \n\nGood for you to stay calm and clear and reflect back his own attitudes. Keep that line and maybe he really will examine himself further. \n\nFor your mother, it sounds like she\u2019s not at a place of realizing the harm he/she did and choosing to still prioritize his feelings over yours. Maybe reflecting some of her attitude back is helpful too, if you\u2019d like to avoid her rebukes for holding your boundaries. \n\n\u201cYes Mum, we felt bad too as children and wondered why he didn\u2019t feel guilty then (or you for that matter)  so it\u2019s validating to know he is starting to look at his actions.

Stepdad decided that each parent would take care of their own kids rather than treating you all equally. So Stepdad should make up the difference if he's so keen on helping his daughter.

That's not good.", "NTA the only reason he feels guilty is because you won\u2019t loan him money now. Or because he sees you and your brother are doing well for yourself and his kids aren\u2019t.

When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.\n\nWe didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.\n\nSo my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.\n\nI visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is \u00a3500k and she needs a \u00a3150k deposit. She has \u00a3100k so far. \u00a325k on her own, \u00a325k from her mum and \u00a350k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra \u00a350k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.\n\nI said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave \u00a310k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back \"like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?\"\n\nEveryone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.\n\nMy mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Mom for marrying him & allowing this treatment. Your mom still doesn't get it if she still defending him. Resentment they both contributed to. They both reaped what they sowed. I doubt that if you weren't as financially independent and better off he still be treating you the same way & bragging about his daughters doing better than you. Your right they can't buy or make up the time with what they did.  I would of ask granny to live with her instead.", "NTA! The audacity of your stepfather is unbelievable", "NTA. I seriously don't understand how people can ask for money like this.", "NTA He made that choice daily for years. Easy to regret it now that he needs something from you. But he (and your mother) have a lot of nerve. I wouldn't give them a dime and would make it clear the plan should be for the kids they actually treated well to care for them in their old age.", "NTA.  He can't possibly feel guilty if he's hounding you for money now.  If he felt guilty, he'd be giving you every spare cent and just generally trying to find every way he can to make it up to you.  He still thinks Amy deserves more and that you, the second-class kid, should provide it.\n\nWhat human being raises four kids in the same house but with different standards of living?  He is a colossal prick and I wonder about your mother, too, watching it happen.", "Your MOM is the asshole for having married this guy and putting you and your brother in that situation. Jhc.

Only now when he needs money is he contrite. He deserves to have it thrown in his face, and so do your stepsiblings.", "Has he ever expressed remorse for the way he treated you and your brother as children before or is he only remorseful now that he wants money?", "NTA. Sometimes AHs need to be reminded they were AHs, and there are lifelong consequences for that. \n\nHe's asking you for money because you are successful in spite of his spiteful mistakes in parenting you. And you can tell your mother to be quiet if she objects. She enabled his bad parenting by not standing up for you. She's as bad as him in her own way - she should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA.

Now that his true family needs something, he has the gall\u2014 the fucking AUDACITY\u2014 to admonish you about not helping family?!?! What an awful, entitled, selfish human being. I applaud you for standing up for yourself and sticking to that boundary. He and they have no flippin right to ask you for so much as a glass of water. How horrible to grow up like that\u2026 my heart goes out to you.", "NTA, and I bet rejecting him felt so, so good. \n\nMoney shmoney, that was not an equal partnership and it sounds like you and your sibling were the only two that genuinely suffered because of it.

He basically punished you and your brother for being poor. He also financially abused your mother.", "NTA, and you had every right to go about it the way you did. He should've expected it, I mean he took care of his own kids and ignored y'all, why should you help take care of his kids?", "NTA, serves him right for having the gall to even ask.

LET ME SAY IT AGAIN, ***NTA***!", "NTA. The whole separating finances thing was a terrible idea to begin with. How could he sit back and watch his stepkids suffer like that?

I personally don't think you should have to pay for your step sisters house especially since your step father went big on your step sisters but never thought about you or your brother.

He wasn't taking a quick no, and deserved to hear the reason why. Your spoiled brat stepsister needs to lower her sights. If she cannot afford the downpayment, she needs to buy a less expensive home.", "NTA\n\ndoes your mom realize you already turned him down multiple times? how many more times were you expected to say no before he understood it was no?", "NTA. Bravo.", "NTA.  He put a roof over your head while treating you like 2nd class citizens.  Not exactly a great step-parent.  You are now conveniently \"family\" as his \"real daughter\" needs something you can provide - money.  He only regrets his actions because you and Luke can now call him out as adults if the need arises.  He knows it.  Your mom knows it.  His daughters know it.  It's good to establish boundaries as an adult...as he did when you were living under his roof.", "No, NTA and not your problem. Yes it\u2019s good that he realizes his mistake but those lines were drawn years ago. Now that his kids need it, you and your sibling are expected to cough up the cash? No, I\u2019m sorry. He should have treated you all the same.", "OP I think you handled this beautifully. I am so proud of you. The fact that he feels guilty with regard to your childhood is completely irrelevant. Mum is a pain in the ass and she should be disregarded. \nGood job OP-keep that spine stiff. \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA you can\u2019t treat someone horribly their whole life and then expect them to do something for you later. The fact is he made his feeling about you and your brother crystal clear. He did not view you as equal and he made sure he proved it at every turn. After doing this he can not call the family card when he needs something.\n\nAs for your nun ask her where was that energy when you where kids. Why didn\u2019t she have the balls to call her husband out for his treatment of the 2 people who where suppose to mean the world to her. Don\u2019t get me wrong your stepfather is a asshole. But your mother is the one you should hold this against. She told you to appreciate you lived in a nice house. In other words shut up and let me enjoy the high life. She failed you miserably. She should have protected you. But instead she put her comfort before hers and let her 2 innocent children be abused emotionally.\n\nSo I would ask her how her guilt is since it was her greed and selfishness that put you in a horrible postion.", "NTA. Your mom though\u2026 sounds like she\u2019s STILL under the influence of whatever thought process she employed to allow such injustice in your childhood. Actions have consequences, and if stepdad feels like shit, it\u2019s because he should in order to be incentivized to do things better. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so intolerable for your mom to witness stepdad\u2019s discomfort, but that\u2019s not your problem. He continued to push after you said \u2018no\u2019, and then you had to remind him of the dynamics that HE (not you) engineered into your family system. I\u2019m sorry you had to be under his power in your youth, and that your mom was such an absent advocate for you and Luke. I\u2019m happy you got a happy financial ending at least, and I hope you have lots of safe, uncompromised love in your life as well.", "NTA. Just.... nta. What strikes me right off is he feels \"so guilty\" about it but never brought it up before, no apology, nothing.\n\nThey're not entitled to your money, and you were a lot nicer than I'd have been in the same situation.", "NTA. I think he needed to hear that.", "Uh, you are NTA but in fact are a QUEEN.  \n\nI love every word you said. Do not feel guilty about a single one.", "NTA. Shame him.

Sounds like you made your point, which I think was overdue and it needed to be said.", "He only \u201cfeels\u201d guilty because he is wants something.

In no way are you wrong, and you are NTA.", "NTA and how are you even on speaking terms with these monsters?", "NTA.  \"Pay you back out of the inheritance\" is a sleazy way of saying \"some time in the future, if you're lucky.\"  You aren't automatically entitled to the inheritance, putting you in the will can be undone, and good luck collecting on a contract.\n\nHas he ever apologized for mistreating you when you were kids before this?  No?  He must not feel that guilty, then.  He hasn't tried to make it right.  He just wants to turn free words into 50k for his kid, the one who got way more than 50k in free shit while you got the barest of minimums.", "NTA. Your stepfather is a pill. What inheritance is he talking about? He made it very clear during your youth that he doesn\u2019t plan to treat you same as his bio kids, so he isn\u2019t leaving you a penny. What family?

You were absolutely right to remind him how you were treated as a child", "NTH What goes around comes around. Not your responsibility to help them. If they want help now he should have helped you then.", "NTA and if he feels so guilty why has he never acknowledged it, mum? Also, your mum enabled this. You and your brother were the proverbial red-headed stepchildren.", "NTA. You and your brother earned your way to where you are now with no help from your stepfather. Congratulations; you should be proud of that. \n\nYou owe him nothing. You owe his children nothing. You didn't bring up his crappy treatment of you until he pushed you.

His karma comes back to him and he doesn't like himself.", ">he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.\n\nI don't see many people commenting on this. He would repay you after inheritance? Sounds like he was planning on not paying you back then.

You'd never see it back.\n\nSounds like step-sister has enough backing to get herself a smaller or less nice house.", "Honestly, the audacity to ask such a thing, if he actually feels guilty and acknowledges what an unbelievable prick he was to you, is almost worse.", "Your response was perfect. Why doesnt your mom stand up fpr you guys? She sucks so bad. Nta", "His words are worthless and I'm glad you see right through them!", "Dependant on the area, but a \u00a3450k house is massive for your first buy", "This isn't the US. Most of Europe is in a massive housing crisis and the interest on mortgages just rose 3-5% in the UK. It sounds about right that she would need a deposit of that size. Especially as we don't know her job or her credit score but she's definitely not as successful as OP so she's going to need a higher deposit just to qualify for a mortgage.", "THIS THIS THIS\n\nScrew 'em, OP.  You did it exactly right!\n\nAlso, I'm sorry he treated you and your brother this way, and that your mom didn't step up.  That really sucks.  Congrats for making it out and making it your own ways!", "And not just because stepfather is a hypocrite. This is the stupidest investment ever. Stepsister has managed to save $25K out of the $150K she needs, and that's only the deposit.", "He\u2019s not going to have any money when he dies. Probably leave his family in debt.", "I grew up poor, know the struggle.  I\u2019m proud of you too.", "He says he would have done something else because you said you would lend them money", "Sdad mentioned the inheritance would pay back the contribution. I kinda feel an epilogue coming up with him changing his will to exclude OP.", "Hope your brother doesn\u2019t give a loan either and am glad you guys have each other.", "It's the fact that your mom thinks children should handle abuse and get over it better than an adult but you dare not make a grown man cry about what he did.\n\nIf he really was sorry, he would actually apologize for it. Not say he'd do things differently and doesn't want to think about it. That's vague and could even mean sabotage for all she knows.\n\n\nHas she ever apologized or just stuck up for his fake tears?\n\nI'd have taken up constantly reminding the both of it every time they ask some dumb shit and told them to suck it up like they were expecting of me.", "Also why isn't their sister asking?", "Truer words were never spoken.  Whoever wrote that song so Rihanna could do it justice was a genius.  Too bad there were no clothrs to set fire to though like in the video...that was a mic drop.", "They've been together for 19 years now. He's clearly being an asshole on his own, why adding one completely baseless reason like that?", "She knows their treatment was wrong. She let her daddy do the dirty disrespectful job. Gah. They have no respect for you guys. They\u2019re probably pissed that you aren\u2019t reliant on them. They have nothing on you & it\u2019s amazing!", "It's almost worse, because he's *still* expecting OP and her brother to sacrifice for his kids when they got nothing themselves", "I'm glad someone said something about the mom. I can't imagine letting someone do that to my kids just to live in a nice house???? What??", "It was all about safety for her. Damn. What a god awful experience. NTA. \nDude, I love you and Luke. I was kicked out of foster care in the middle of the night & I promised myself I would never be reliant on anyone who didn\u2019t bother to do for me. You\u2019re amazing. Good on you. \n\nYour step sister dad mom have no business asking you or your brother for money. Screw that man. This is the long season of self care & correcting generations of abuse.", "They\u2019re going to inherit his money and burn right through it.", "Yep I could almost understand making your teenage son and daughter share a room because you'd do what you had to if you're poor. I don't get gallivanting on holidays without your children. I'd have just said that I'm staying at home if my kids can't come.", "And than she probably would had to search for a new home and a way to Afford it.", "Well.. if the stepdad's daughter can't afford the house then she should downsize and find something within her means lol", "If he even has anything. He\u2019s not giving them\nanything. He used it as a carrot thinking they\u2019d snatch it up because he knows he wasn\u2019t good to them. It\u2019s frustrating when people are so callous with other peoples feelings"]}
