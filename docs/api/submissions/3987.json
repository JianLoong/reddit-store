You work all day . He also works all day. When you get home the remaining chores need to be split up. You don\u2019t get to work 40 hours a week and have your husband work and/or be on call 24/7. It sounds like overall he\u2019s been doing a great job. I\u2019ve been a stay at home mom and I\u2019ve been a working mom and I can tell you that going to work is easier than caring for a baby around the clock .

You sound like you are man from the 1950s.  Taking care of kids and a house is hard work.  He's been tired one time, and you jumped all over him for it.  I've been both a stay at home mom, and a working mom.  Being a stay at home parent is incredibly hard work.  I can't get over how it's only been once that he has been too tired and asked you to do something.

Jeez. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nIt is *not* the stay-at-home parent\u2019s job to be responsible for all the chores. It\u2019s BS when men do it to women and it\u2019s BS when you do it to your husband. While you\u2019re at work, your husband\u2019s job is to care for the baby and anything else he can manage to get to around the house (some days that will be a lot and some days that will be nothing).

Your husband works or is on call 168 hours per week.  How is that fair? You are still a parent with obligations to your child, & your husband is not household staff just because he\u2019s not bringing in a paycheck.", "YTA your husband\u2019s job is to be a stay at home DAD not a housekeeper. You should be 50/50 on household things that need to be done outside of work hours. It\u2019s sounds like he is doing his best and you are being ungrateful AF", "YTA. YOU ARE ALSO A PARENT. The fact that you don\u2019t know how to make your own child\u2019s food says A LOT. And you think just because you work you shouldn\u2019t have to do household chores IN THE HOUSE YOU ALSO LIVE IN. Do better.", "YTA. As a former stay at home parent, I think all parents at home have a \"right\" to complain.\n\nShit, it's the only thing you do get. The job **Never. Fucking. Ends.** There's no pay, no end to the tasks, and people always tell you that you got it made.", "YTA.  You made a mountain out of an anthill.  Correct me if I'm wrong but this sounds like this rarely ever happens that he doesn't have food prepared for the kid. He said he was tired. Is he not allowed to have an off moment? Isn't he always on point otherwise?\n\n>My husband does a pretty great job, the house is always clean, I always get dinner when I get home, our son smells always great and is also well-fed.\n\nYou said you love feeding the kid.   You should have made the bottle and kept it pushing. Instead, you had a complete over-reaction which is very indicative of an underlying and long-standing resentment that your partner is the stay-at-home partner.\n\nChoosing to lash out and attack him for missing 1 bottle shows you resent the entire idea and used his one moment of weakness to lash out and punish him instead of being a loving partner and helping him out in his moment of weakness.  What you wrote here shows how you really feel about it:\n\n>but another income would be much better. We could\u2019ve hired my mom to babysit but he refused.\n\nIt shows that you never really accepted him changing his role in the family and now that he chose to be a stay-at-home dad, you are expecting him to be literally perfect and will punish him otherwise, like you did here by taunting him for \"signing up\" but not being able to be perfect (who really is?).", "You seem to lack compassion and understanding of how difficult the sahm can be. But mostly your expectations are way off. Is he never allowed to be tired?? You\u2019ve been cruel OP for no reason. He needs your support. YTA", "YTA.\n\nSo you get to work 9-5 (or whatever your hours are) but he has to work 24/7. That's NOT what a healthy relationship looks like, no matter the genders of the people", "Yta.\n\nLet's see, Stay at home takes care of the child feeding, entertaining, educating, outings, playdates, cleaning, taking to doctor. Cooking, cleaning, laundry. Is he keeping the yard , balancing the books, paying the bills, doing or arranging for house repairs. \n\nIt's exhausting. You sound like my dad and all the other breadwinner dads. Waltz in after work, kick up, watch TV.. gotta relax cuz I'm making all the money. You just spend ma money and sit at home all day...\n\nGoing to work is a lot easier than running the household physically and hours wide. Walking and doing eff all is a real asymmetric arrangement and a sure way to escalate this standoff. You gotta support your partner instead of lecturing them on \"you signed up for it, do your job\"", "YTA. How could you possibly think that this way of thinking is ok? Taking care of a child and running a household is work and it\u2019s more time consuming and stressful than most jobs. When you get home from work, you should roll up your sleeves to help out with whatever chores your husband wasn\u2019t able to complete during the day. Being the breadwinner doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger when you get home. \n\nIf you keep this up, one of two things will happen. Either your marriage will be irreparably damaged because your husband feels disrespected or your husband will insist on returning to work earlier than you planned and the two of you will be at in paying thousands of dollars for child care every month.", "YTA. \n\nAnd no, your description of what a SAHP does is not accurate. SAHP are not typically responsible for every aspect of the home and the childcare.  You aren't contributing anything to the home life. You are simply a bank account at this point who occasionally bothers to feed your shared child. \n\nPartners work together to raise their children and take care of the home. \n\nI have been a SAHP, my husband has been a SAHP. In that time we still split chores and after the one working got off work, we shared in the chores associated with raising our children. We shared the chores of preparing meals. \n\nAlso consider that they way you want things you constantly get time for yourself and time off while your husband has to work 24/7.", "YTA.", "YTA.

A little empathy would go a long way.", "YTA you know very well that some days are harder than others for both of you. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t help out now and then. I\u2019m sure once in a while you help someone at your job too and someone might help you or answer your questions or give feedback or who knows but some days everyone needs a little help, preferably without a guilt trip about why they don\u2019t deserve help and shouldn\u2019t be asking for help.", "YTA\n\nYou spent that entire post describing the living situation and like a couple of lines of the actual \"incident.\" \n\nSounds like you are annoyed or jealous that he decided to be a stay at home dad. You get that's not a bad thing, right?\n\nYou can make the kid's food the one time he asks you to, he isn't your servant.", "YTA. Are you kidding me? Does this guy even get a break? Being a stay at home parent doesn\u2019t mean that your partner doesn\u2019t do shit to help you.", "You channelled Ralph Kramden, and it's an ugly look.\n\nApologise sincerely, and don't pull that shite again. YTA.", "YTA - you both signed up to be parents. Childcare is a full time job.

And in this case your husband isn't even asking for some time off he asked for your help with one meal... \n\nPeople complain about their jobs. Even if they love their jobs. Doing a job doesn't mean you can't complain to people who love you. \n\nYour husband is a person. A human. Consider treating him like one.", "YTA. \" Now that I'm the breadwinner, I think all the house chores are his responsibility now \", that says it all. Just because people did it like that back in the day doesn't mean you have to carry the mistakes forward. It's team effort, 50% both ways, no?", "It sounds like you have some resentment about his decision to quit his job to stay at home with your son. That is a decision that you should have made together as a couple. You two need to talk about this, rather than lashing out or silently seething at each other.", "YTA. Never thought I'd see a gay 50s husband mindset on here but here we are I guess. \n\nTry and be more empathetic, and unlearn your weird misogynistic ideas? Like holy shit lol.", "YTA and a major one at that. I hope you never vent or complain or mention a bad day, because ya know, you chose to work. Everyone is entitled to have long tiring days and being a stay at home parent isn\u2019t different in that respect. Are you always such an ah and disrespectful towards him?", "YTA  'we have been in each others life for 18 years (10 as partners)'\n\nNot sounding much like a partnership. Have you suddenly time travelled from the 1950s?", "YTA\n\n\nHe's not your servant!", "YTA. \n\nHow stupid would you feel if you pulled that line on a coworker that was drowning? Just because somebody chose something doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be hard or that they\u2019ll never need help. It was a dumb, thoughtless thing to say to somebody who is supposed to be your partner. \n\nClearly you resent his staying home. Maybe you two should hash that out with a neutral third party present.", "YTA - your partner works while you are at work. It\u2019s not fair that you also expect him to work for every other waking hour while you do what, relax at home? Wait for him to serve you? Why does your work day end by his doesn\u2019t? Why do you think that is fair?", "Same judgment if you were a dad saying you\u2019re the breadwinner so mom must take care of kids and home 24/7\u2026YTA. That isn\u2019t how it works. Your husband is working 24/7 if you aren\u2019t pulling your weight. When does he get a break? When you get home from work and see something that needs to be done, do it. After work and on weekends you should both be doing 50/50 chores and child duties.", "Yes, in this case YTA. It's already been said a dozen times on here but I guess I'll reiterate. Being at home with the kids does not mean you lose your right to complain, you're simply doing one aspect of the division of labor. And no one is expected to be 100% all of the time. There are going to be days that he's tired and needs you to cover down on some of his responsibilities and vice verse. \n\nNow I don't necessarily agree with some of the other posters that you have to come home and immediately 50/50 split the household work, that's a home by home detail to be worked out. But it sounds like this was an unnecessary rift in your marriage on your part. He willingly left his job, to stay with the child; no one obligated him, to stay with the child. Which by every social study standard out there is much better for children, having a stay at home parent. If you wanted him to continue working while your mom watches a child and then you two get to come home at the end of the day and say hi, then you should have just adopted a kid and given it to your mother, would have saved you a few steps.", "YTA. Pick up the day\u2019s slack and parent your son. You were at work and don\u2019t know what all went on that day. It sounds like he\u2019s a great SAHP overall; you refer to this as \u201cthe incident\u201d, not \u201cthis happens all the time\u2026\u201d. I can\u2019t fathom being this tit-for-tat in a relationship where there is a young child to care for. Hopefully you\u2019ve previously discussed your demands that all house chores are his\u2026there\u2019s some pretty unfair expectations going on here.", "Soft yta, yes I agree a stay at home parent should do most of this stuff, but you still got to help a little and from your post this was the first time they asked for help. From my experience if someone that rarely asks for help asks for help they really need it.", "I\u2019m a SAHM and I am the caretaker/cleaner/etc when my fianc\u00e9s at work but when he\u2019s home we BOTH do it. You\u2019re still the mom, you think just because he decided to be the SAHD that cuts your responsibilities to your child??? \n\nThis is literally the same concept of a women having to do everything by herself even when the spouse is home doing whatever they want. YTA!", "Whoa. He\u2019s a SAHD, not a 24/7 indentured servant. \n\nMake your kid some food. You\u2019re a parent, too.\n\nYTA\n\nETA: I seriously feel this is a pisstake.", "YTA. I\u2019m a gay SAHD. Being a stay-at-home parent is a full, 24/7 hour job. Most of the time it is difficult, exhausting, hard work (especially when it\u2019s your first child), and when you have a partner who is ungrateful, lacks understanding, and is unaccommodating, it makes it that much harder. There will be times your husband will be sick, burnt out, overwhelmed, need a break, etc in which you have a responsibility, as both his partner and the other parent, to assist. Parenting is still team effort, even when one is the primary caretaker. When your teammate is down, you step up. \n\nOn top of that, the dynamic your parents had is irrelevant to yours, as you all are completely different people. What worked for them may not work for you and your husband, so projecting that standard onto him is inappropriate.\n\nYour complaints about your husbands choice to take on the role are also inappropriate. It\u2019s perfectly natural he wants to take care of and raise your child, rather than watching someone else do it. You should be supporting that, not weaponizing it. \n\nSo instead of invalidating your husband\u2019s needs, being unsupportive of the role he\u2019s taken on for your child, being overbearing and unappreciative, you give your husband the care and consideration he deserves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You win.", "YTA\n\nhe is not your slave or your employee.\n\nWhen home, parents should.split the workload 50/50. \n\nWhy does he have a 24 hour job while you get set work hours?", "YTA for sure.\n\nEveryone is entitled to off (as in feeling off) days and he has done a wonderful job at handling everything and a young baby. \n\nThere is no reason why you couldn't have done it this one time and let him rest.", "YTA\n\nWe are always allowed to complain and expect our partners to hear us out and help us through those emotions. Don't act like you've never made a decision that you regretted afterwards or felt a little butthurt about even though you know it was the right call.", "YTA -   \n\n\nWhat?! So because he wanted to be a SAHD he's now on call 24/7 - have you ever stayed home just for a few days to take care of a child? It's a full time job, full time with no breaks and because he chose to do that he has to clean everything and make dinner?  \n\n\nI'm so annoyed for your husband, this is supposed to be a partnership. I've been both a SAHM and a working mum - and the working mum was by far the easiest. You owe your husband an apology and quite possibly a day off.", "Everyone thinks YTA... I agree if it was juste this one time. That's true, everbody can have a crappy day and I think your partner should understand and help you on hard times.\n\nIt would have been ok to call him out, or ask him if he is ok if this was becoming an habit. I mean, apparently you both agreed on the system : provider/at home worker. If that is the case and still is for both of you then... \n\n(yes I never understood this lifestyle but to each his own)", "It sounds like you and your husband are both exhausted from taking care of your son. It's important for both of you to communicate openly and honestly about your expectations and responsibilities as parents. It doesn't seem like you were being unreasonable by expecting your husband to take care of the baby's food since that is part of his role as a stay-at-home dad. However, it's also important to remember that being a stay-at-home parent can be exhausting and sometimes help is needed. It's important for both of you to communicate and support each other in your roles as parents. You are not the bad guy in this situation.", "NTA. Taking care of a 6 month old is a walk in the park. I've been a stay at home dad for over 4 years. I have 3 kids and another due via c section on the 8th.\nJust wait till your baby can walk and get into everything.", "NSH.  This is normal family stress, people sometimes fall down on the job or get grumpy. Does not make anyone an AH.  Yeah, he was supposed to have homemade food for the kid and feeding done, and failed.  Homemakers can get worn out and stressed too. Maybe hubs can freeze some Xtra food for occasions like this in the future.", "Right? My daughter has a four year old and two year old twins. Dad works 2 jobs, she works on the weekends but he comes home and does dinner, baths, whatever he can.\n\nReverse the gender on this and we'd be telling the man YTA.", "She\u2019s just deeply sexist and entitled. \n\nIt\u2019s actually a cliche of a sexist man, that he goes to work comes home expects the house clean and the dinner on the table, never giving his wife a minute off or a bit of a hand. \n\nInteresting how many recent stories there of here of women adopting toxic male traits, and how many of them are completely blinded to the hypocrisy/reality of their actions.", "Being a parent is a 24/7 job even when you have another job.", "and let's not negate that she has a social life that does not revolve around having a kid. She can get dressed and leave, and it's okay because \"it's for the family.\" then she stops and gets a coffee, and eases into her day, takes lunch, poops on-the-clock (meaning while getting paid, not like......well, you know!), and schedules VACATION TIME!!!!!!!\n\nThis poor sap is stuck with no chance at a promotion or raise, or chance to move to a better company, while she gets all the accolades for everything she does for everyone, and then comes home expecting things to be pleasant, but he doesn't get to come home - he's ALWAYS AT WORK!!!!", "OP is the mother", ">From my experience if someone that rarely asks for help asks for help they really need it.\n\nWhich turns it into a HARD yta. Seriously, how could OP not read the room?  It's hilarious how pig-headed OP is. I think OP secretly resents the stay-at-home partner because OP doesn't think child rearing is work. It explains why OP jumped down his partner's throat over 1 missing bottle.", ">when you have a partner who is ungrateful,\n\nI'm not ungrateful, I love him and I appreciate everything he does for a family, my point is that we could've had a nanny who takes care of those things but he left his job.", "he was already awake, why does he need to wake up him up to make the food? i don\u2019t understand what is so hard about making the baby\u2019s food when he is already up. and yes he\u2019s a stay at home day, but his husband is also a parent. it doesn\u2019t matter that he works 40 hours a week because his husband is working way more than that.", "How is OP not the bad guy? Her husband was exhausted from taking care of a baby all day and she had the nerve to complain that she had to make the baby food herself. Is this or is this not OP\u2019s child too? She\u2019s just as responsible for taking care of him as her husband is. The fact that OP thinks that she shouldn\u2019t have to do any work around the house just because she\u2019s the only one working is ridiculous. All adults have to do things around the house when they get home from work: feed the cat, walk the dog, make dinner, do laundry etc. Why is OP exempt from that?", "OP is a man.", "He", "They\u2019re both men.", "You could be right, I am overly optimistic at times", "Seriously,  hard YTA indeed. As someone who never asks for help when you do get to that point it is usually when you are already pushed way past your limits.", "OP is a man, just sayin", "You're right. I misread"]}
