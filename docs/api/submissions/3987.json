You work all day . He also works all day. When you get home the remaining chores need to be split up. You don\u2019t get to work 40 hours a week and have your husband work and/or be on call 24/7. It sounds like overall he\u2019s been doing a great job. I\u2019ve been a stay at home mom and I\u2019ve been a working mom and I can tell you that going to work is easier than caring for a baby around the clock .

You sound like you are man from the 1950s.  Taking care of kids and a house is hard work.  He's been tired one time, and you jumped all over him for it.  I've been both a stay at home mom, and a working mom.  Being a stay at home parent is incredibly hard work.  I can't get over how it's only been once that he has been too tired and asked you to do something.

Jeez. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nIt is *not* the stay-at-home parent\u2019s job to be responsible for all the chores. It\u2019s BS when men do it to women and it\u2019s BS when you do it to your husband. While you\u2019re at work, your husband\u2019s job is to care for the baby and anything else he can manage to get to around the house (some days that will be a lot and some days that will be nothing).

Your husband works or is on call 168 hours per week.  How is that fair? You are still a parent with obligations to your child, & your husband is not household staff just because he\u2019s not bringing in a paycheck.", "YTA your husband\u2019s job is to be a stay at home DAD not a housekeeper. You should be 50/50 on household things that need to be done outside of work hours. It\u2019s sounds like he is doing his best and you are being ungrateful AF", "YTA. YOU ARE ALSO A PARENT. The fact that you don\u2019t know how to make your own child\u2019s food says A LOT. And you think just because you work you shouldn\u2019t have to do household chores IN THE HOUSE YOU ALSO LIVE IN. Do better.", "YTA. As a former stay at home parent, I think all parents at home have a \"right\" to complain.\n\nShit, it's the only thing you do get. The job **Never. Fucking. Ends.** There's no pay, no end to the tasks, and people always tell you that you got it made.", "YTA.  You made a mountain out of an anthill.  Correct me if I'm wrong but this sounds like this rarely ever happens that he doesn't have food prepared for the kid. He said he was tired. Is he not allowed to have an off moment? Isn't he always on point otherwise?\n\n>My husband does a pretty great job, the house is always clean, I always get dinner when I get home, our son smells always great and is also well-fed.\n\nYou said you love feeding the kid.   You should have made the bottle and kept it pushing. Instead, you had a complete over-reaction which is very indicative of an underlying and long-standing resentment that your partner is the stay-at-home partner.\n\nChoosing to lash out and attack him for missing 1 bottle shows you resent the entire idea and used his one moment of weakness to lash out and punish him instead of being a loving partner and helping him out in his moment of weakness.  What you wrote here shows how you really feel about it:\n\n>but another income would be much better. We could\u2019ve hired my mom to babysit but he refused.\n\nIt shows that you never really accepted him changing his role in the family and now that he chose to be a stay-at-home dad, you are expecting him to be literally perfect and will punish him otherwise, like you did here by taunting him for \"signing up\" but not being able to be perfect (who really is?).", "You seem to lack compassion and understanding of how difficult the sahm can be. But mostly your expectations are way off. Is he never allowed to be tired?? You\u2019ve been cruel OP for no reason. He needs your support. YTA", "YTA.\n\nSo you get to work 9-5 (or whatever your hours are) but he has to work 24/7. That's NOT what a healthy relationship looks like, no matter the genders of the people", "Yta.\n\nLet's see, Stay at home takes care of the child feeding, entertaining, educating, outings, playdates, cleaning, taking to doctor. Cooking, cleaning, laundry. Is he keeping the yard , balancing the books, paying the bills, doing or arranging for house repairs. \n\nIt's exhausting. You sound like my dad and all the other breadwinner dads. Waltz in after work, kick up, watch TV.. gotta relax cuz I'm making all the money. You just spend ma money and sit at home all day...\n\nGoing to work is a lot easier than running the household physically and hours wide. Walking and doing eff all is a real asymmetric arrangement and a sure way to escalate this standoff. You gotta support your partner instead of lecturing them on \"you signed up for it, do your job\"", "YTA. How could you possibly think that this way of thinking is ok? Taking care of a child and running a household is work and it\u2019s more time consuming and stressful than most jobs. When you get home from work, you should roll up your sleeves to help out with whatever chores your husband wasn\u2019t able to complete during the day. Being the breadwinner doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger when you get home. \n\nIf you keep this up, one of two things will happen. Either your marriage will be irreparably damaged because your husband feels disrespected or your husband will insist on returning to work earlier than you planned and the two of you will be at in paying thousands of dollars for child care every month.", "YTA. \n\nAnd no, your description of what a SAHP does is not accurate. SAHP are not typically responsible for every aspect of the home and the childcare.  You aren't contributing anything to the home life. You are simply a bank account at this point who occasionally bothers to feed your shared child. \n\nPartners work together to raise their children and take care of the home. \n\nI have been a SAHP, my husband has been a SAHP. In that time we still split chores and after the one working got off work, we shared in the chores associated with raising our children. We shared the chores of preparing meals. \n\nAlso consider that they way you want things you constantly get time for yourself and time off while your husband has to work 24/7.", "YTA.", "YTA.

I\u2019m sure once in a while you help someone at your job too and someone might help you or answer your questions or give feedback or who knows but some days everyone needs a little help, preferably without a guilt trip about why they don\u2019t deserve help and shouldn\u2019t be asking for help.", "YTA\n\nYou spent that entire post describing the living situation and like a couple of lines of the actual \"incident.\" \n\nSounds like you are annoyed or jealous that he decided to be a stay at home dad. You get that's not a bad thing, right?\n\nYou can make the kid's food the one time he asks you to, he isn't your servant.", "YTA. Are you kidding me? Does this guy even get a break? Being a stay at home parent doesn\u2019t mean that your partner doesn\u2019t do shit to help you.", "You channelled Ralph Kramden, and it's an ugly look.\n\nApologise sincerely, and don't pull that shite again. YTA.", "YTA - you both signed up to be parents. Childcare is a full time job.

And in this case your husband isn't even asking for some time off he asked for your help with one meal... \n\nPeople complain about their jobs. Even if they love their jobs. Doing a job doesn't mean you can't complain to people who love you. \n\nYour husband is a person. A human. Consider treating him like one.", "YTA. \" Now that I'm the breadwinner, I think all the house chores are his responsibility now \", that says it all. Just because people did it like that back in the day doesn't mean you have to carry the mistakes forward. It's team effort, 50% both ways, no?", "It sounds like you have some resentment about his decision to quit his job to stay at home with your son. That is a decision that you should have made together as a couple. You two need to talk about this, rather than lashing out or silently seething at each other.", "YTA. Never thought I'd see a gay 50s husband mindset on here but here we are I guess. \n\nTry and be more empathetic, and unlearn your weird misogynistic ideas? Like holy shit lol.", "YTA and a major one at that. I hope you never vent or complain or mention a bad day, because ya know, you chose to work. Everyone is entitled to have long tiring days and being a stay at home parent isn\u2019t different in that respect. Are you always such an ah and disrespectful towards him?", "YTA  'we have been in each others life for 18 years (10 as partners)'\n\nNot sounding much like a partnership. Have you suddenly time travelled from the 1950s?", "YTA\n\n\nHe's not your servant!", "YTA. \n\nHow stupid would you feel if you pulled that line on a coworker that was drowning? Just because somebody chose something doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be hard or that they\u2019ll never need help. It was a dumb, thoughtless thing to say to somebody who is supposed to be your partner. \n\nClearly you resent his staying home. Maybe you two should hash that out with a neutral third party present.", "YTA - your partner works while you are at work. It\u2019s not fair that you also expect him to work for every other waking hour while you do what, relax at home? Wait for him to serve you? Why does your work day end by his doesn\u2019t? Why do you think that is fair?", "Same judgment if you were a dad saying you\u2019re the breadwinner so mom must take care of kids and home 24/7\u2026YTA. That isn\u2019t how it works. Your husband is working 24/7 if you aren\u2019t pulling your weight. When does he get a break? When you get home from work and see something that needs to be done, do it. After work and on weekends you should both be doing 50/50 chores and child duties.", "Yes, in this case YTA. It's already been said a dozen times on here but I guess I'll reiterate. Being at home with the kids does not mean you lose your right to complain, you're simply doing one aspect of the division of labor. And no one is expected to be 100% all of the time. There are going to be days that he's tired and needs you to cover down on some of his responsibilities and vice verse. \n\nNow I don't necessarily agree with some of the other posters that you have to come home and immediately 50/50 split the household work, that's a home by home detail to be worked out. But it sounds like this was an unnecessary rift in your marriage on your part. He willingly left his job, to stay with the child; no one obligated him, to stay with the child. Which by every social study standard out there is much better for children, having a stay at home parent. If you wanted him to continue working while your mom watches a child and then you two get to come home at the end of the day and say hi, then you should have just adopted a kid and given it to your mother, would have saved you a few steps.", "YTA. Pick up the day\u2019s slack and parent your son. You were at work and don\u2019t know what all went on that day. It sounds like he\u2019s a great SAHP overall; you refer to this as \u201cthe incident\u201d, not \u201cthis happens all the time\u2026\u201d. I can\u2019t fathom being this tit-for-tat in a relationship where there is a young child to care for. Hopefully you\u2019ve previously discussed your demands that all house chores are his\u2026there\u2019s some pretty unfair expectations going on here.", "Soft yta, yes I agree a stay at home parent should do most of this stuff, but you still got to help a little and from your post this was the first time they asked for help. From my experience if someone that rarely asks for help asks for help they really need it.", "I\u2019m a SAHM and I am the caretaker/cleaner/etc when my fianc\u00e9s at work but when he\u2019s home we BOTH do it. You\u2019re still the mom, you think just because he decided to be the SAHD that cuts your responsibilities to your child??? \n\nThis is literally the same concept of a women having to do everything by herself even when the spouse is home doing whatever they want. YTA!", "Whoa. He\u2019s a SAHD, not a 24/7 indentured servant. \n\nMake your kid some food. You\u2019re a parent, too.\n\nYTA\n\nETA: I seriously feel this is a pisstake.", "YTA. I\u2019m a gay SAHD. Being a stay-at-home parent is a full, 24/7 hour job. Most of the time it is difficult, exhausting, hard work (especially when it\u2019s your first child), and when you have a partner who is ungrateful, lacks understanding, and is unaccommodating, it makes it that much harder. There will be times your husband will be sick, burnt out, overwhelmed, need a break, etc in which you have a responsibility, as both his partner and the other parent, to assist. Parenting is still team effort, even when one is the primary caretaker. When your teammate is down, you step up. \n\nOn top of that, the dynamic your parents had is irrelevant to yours, as you all are completely different people. What worked for them may not work for you and your husband, so projecting that standard onto him is unreasonable.\n\nYour complaints about your husbands choice to take on the role are also unreasonable. It\u2019s perfectly natural he wants to take care of and raise your child, rather than watching someone else do it. You should be supporting that, not weaponizing it. One instance you\u2019ve provided where he needed a spot of help and you go off the deep end about how he doesn\u2019t have a right to complain? That is not healthy. \n\nSo instead of invalidating your husband\u2019s needs, being unsupportive of the role he\u2019s taken on for your child, being overbearing and unappreciative, you give your husband the care and consideration he deserves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
