She's giving up her second job for it. We live in an apartment unit with 3 bedrooms, which means we can't start our own family (which is why I bought a 3 bedroom unit).\n\nThe main problem is that my partners parents, and the parents of her brother in law, aren't good parents.

You need to sit her down and talk about this. Hopefully there is some middle ground, but if she is not willing to budge from her current plan, you may need to decide whether you want to stay with her.", "NTA for not wanting it, but if she REALLY wants it then your life goals just aren\u2019t compatible anymore. It was wrong of her to confirm all of this with them without your input for sure. This is a choice she can make for herself, but not for you. Rest assured that you\u2019re correct to be upset this decision was made without your input. But be ready to accept that raising the nephew might be more important to her than your relationship. (Fixed spelling)", "NTA this is not a decision your partner can make unilaterally. \n\nAnd while having a mother figure in his life would certainly be beneficial for the little boy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with single parenting and there is no reason her BIL can't live on his own and raise his son on his own, like millions of single parents around the world, do. \n\nYou need to be very firm here. This isn't something anyone can or should even try to guilt you into accepting. Especially if the house she wants to move them in is yours... she is delusional for thinking she could decide without you. \n\nDon't let this happen. It'll be a disaster and that's the last thing that little boy needs right now.", "NTA.\n\nPlenty of people, men and women, are single parents. They somehow manage. Most do a pretty good job of it too. There is no reason he needs to move in with his kid for more than a few days or maybe a few weeks while he's grieving. Beyond that, he needs to be in his own home with his kid and he needs to sort it out himself. You do not have to agree to take him in at the expense of your own lives. Sit your partner down and have a serious discussion. See if you can come to some agreement such as the kid can stay with you for x days in the summer break or they can come for Christmas. Something like that would be fine. NOT living there full time.", "NTA\n\nThis situation is going to ruin your relationship either way. You can decide if that happens now or after you have spent many years living with and supporting a stranger and his son. \n\nDo not get married or add her to the deed of your home until this situation is 100% resolved.\n\nETA\n\nSince there are 2 countries involved. Would you have to sponsor them to move to your country? That could put you on the hook for many years of financial support. If the living situation doesn\u2019t work out.

Your girlfriend signed both of you up for a role she did not consult with you. Wanting to help her nephew and BIL is not a bad thing. Opening up your home without your okay is. And expecting you to pay most of the bills is completely unfair when there will be 3 working adults in the house. \n\nI say that you\u2019d be paying the most because your girlfriend isn\u2019t really expecting BIL to pay her for the childcare she\u2019s going to provide or for any of the bills. With 3 adults in the house the bills should be split three ways. If your girlfriend won\u2019t compromise, it\u2019s time for you to start a new chapter.", "NTA \n\nA relationship is a team effort and your partner should not have made a decision this big by herself.

She has zero right to offer up YOUR home that is in YOUR name (you said you bought it) without discussing it with you first. I\u2019m super sorry for her loss. But you need to put your foot down.

Either way, one of you is going to harbor MASSIVE resentment over this\n\nSo if you own the apartment in your name only, kindly tell her that if she insists on coparenting with her BIL she needs to move to where they live\n\nIf you rent, break the lease and move on\n\nOtherwise, you will be taking care of 2 adults and one child all on your own.

While you are not morally obligated to provide housing or parenting services that you didnt sign up for, everyone here is clearly going through something very tragic.

I can understand wanting to help, but this is a serious change that needs discussion with the person you are living with before just deciding to do it in a shared space. A partnership means that you will both work together of course, but it doesn't mean that one of you decides to do something that causes this many life changes without discussing it first.", "NTA.  You should tell your partner how you feel immediately.  Then she will have to decide if she wants to stay with you, or move to be a parent to her nephew.  There is nothing wrong with her wanting to be involved in her nephew's life, but she can't just move him in with you without your consent.", "DUMP HER ASS!!!!! SHE AND HE ARE NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!

This is not acceptable.\n\nIf you really don't want this to happen, break up.

Just be prepared for a lot of pressure and guilt tripping from your girlfriend and her family.\n\nWhy would single parenting be such a problem? Your partner's brother-in-law is an adult who should be able to be a single father. Plenty of parents end up as a single parent when their partner dies. As sad as it is, they manage to do just fine, with some support from family and friends. And who knows, maybe he might meet a new partner who can be a stepmother for the child.\n\nSadly, many men who have kids let their girlfriend/wife do all the dirty work and refuse to make any proper effort at parenting. Is your girlfriend's brother-in-law mostly doing this because he wants to let a woman, your girlfriend, do all the heavy parenting while he only does fun things on the weekends?\n\nIf you are not willing to accept this, leave.

One option you have is to sell the place and buy yourself a one-bedroom unit.", "NAH\n\nShe made a unilateral decision and that was wrong, but she is likely afraid and grieving.

That you need her to be your partner FIRST, which means discussing things with you before committing to them.

Not on a permanent basis which is what this sounds like.", "NTA. Looks like she will end up marrying him too ? None of this sounds good. Do you rent or co own the home ?", "NTA single parenting is not impossible. This is a weird arrangement.", "NTA. This (having a total stranger and child move into your home) is not what you signed up for. Either get their plans rearranged to ones you are comfortable with (perhaps they move nearby but not into your home, your partner takes the nephew sometimes) or say NO. \n\nAnd if they refuse to change, move out - unhappy living with people you don\u2019t want will breakup your relationship anyhow.", "Exactly. And then what happens when BIL meets a nice lady he'd like to settle down with and moves him and his son into said lady's place? Then OPs partner will be devastated.", "Yeah I'd be helping to sponsor him in, although if he gets a job then he can find his own place but she said she'd still want to proactively coparent if they moved out.", "This was my first thought: is she into BIL?", "If you are in the US and you sponsor him. You are financially responsible for him until he has worked 40 quarters. \n\nWhat do you mean, \u201cif he gets a job?\u201d", "So it sounds like she is expecting you to financially support her and her BIL and nephew?! That is not something you decide unilaterally without talking to your partner. And even if she had talked to you first, I don't see any reason why you'd agree to this. Especially with your partner and her BIL both grieving, your partner slipping into the motherly role like a stand-in for her sister is NOT healthy. Many times in this situation, the two adults grief-bond and then end up together. This isn't going to end well for you, either way.", "Nta bruh just break up with her and let them get married because this is weird. Why can\u2019t the dad step up like a normal person?", "NTA, but you should just break it off and make sure she lives somewhere else if you own the apartment. She clearly has zero respect for you or your ability to have a say in your living situation and financial obligations. It sounds like she's ready to play wife with that family regardless of your feelings on the matter.", "W - that is something that should have thoroughly discussed before and agreed on a plan before anything was said about moving into your home.\n\nHer thinking at the moment is not logical but all emotional.\n\nSomeone or all parties involved is/are going to get hurt or messed up.", "Title alone I was \"YTA\" but after reading your story, you're NTA.\n\nThose are big decisions she made, they are coming from the right place, but those decisions aren't hers to make.\n\nI will say tread lightly because this could be a coping mechanism for her. Her world is spinning out of control with her sister dying.\n\nSending a lot of love to your families as you navigate this time.", "If this was an orphaned nephew, then absolutely move him in, raise him and make whatever sacrifices are necessary.\n\nBut this kid will still have a parent. He doesn't need you and he doesn't need his aunt stepping straight into the mum role.\n\nNTA this is seriously overstepping.", "I sole own it, I bought it with my family as guarantees.", "I appreciate the love, and yes I'm kind of stuck. Like... I want to be clear and concise, but also I'm not sure whether this planning is a coping mechanism for her or whether it will actually happen.", "Providing accommodation n paying the bills", "> \n> \n> \n> \n> Now. You\u2019re likely in 2nd place here\n\nThing is, he doesn't need to be in 1st place at all. It's just that 1st place doesn't need to be 'move in my BIL and his daughter'. It can be supporting them with babysitting and money. It can be a lot of things less than that.", "This will likely resolve its self at the visa stage. I can't see them being granted a NZ visa. I know NZ is a bit easier than but Aus but they wouldnt be eligible for family (as they are not your immediate family or dependent), unlikely to be eligible igible for highly skilled or entrepreneur visa. And processing times are often over 10mths for a visa.", "Look even if she co-owned the home, it would have been brazenly wrong of her to offer to have an adult and child live with you indefinitely (especially below market rates for rent). However because you own the home, maybe put your foot down and tell her this NEEDS to be a conversation before anything can be agreed. If she wants to help out, maybe she should stay with her nephew to give him stability (he'd have her and BIL in the country he knows well) for a month or two, and then see what the best course of action is based on where the nephew is at a month or so after losing his mom (it's going to be hard no matter what, but you can't really know how a kid is going to react in this situation after the initial shock has reached him).", "Yeah that's a good point, I really appreciate it.", "He said his family helped him buy it", "....just now. My comments were 7 hours ago, based on the original post."]}
