Currently they live in a different country, I've never met them but they'd apparently move over here.\n\nWe just moved into our own place together. She offered this already, that they could stay indefinitely, and only pay what they can afford while we cover the rest. I don't earn much, and my partner doesn't either. She's giving up her second job for it. We live in an apartment unit with 3 bedrooms, which means we can't start our own family (which is why I bought a 3 bedroom unit).\n\nThe main problem is that my partners parents, and the parents of her brother in law, aren't good parents.

You need to sit her down and talk about this. Hopefully there is some middle ground, but if she is not willing to budge from her current plan, you may need to decide whether you want to stay with her.", "NTA for not wanting it, but if she REALLY wants it then your life goals just aren\u2019t compatible anymore. It was wrong of her to confirm all of this with them without your input for sure. This is a choice she can make for herself, but not for you. Rest assured that you\u2019re correct to be upset this decision was made without your input. But be ready to accept that raising the nephew might be more important to her than your relationship. (Fixed spelling)", "NTA this is not a decision your partner can make unilaterally. \n\nAnd while having a mother figure in his life would certainly be beneficial for the little boy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with single parenting and there is no reason her BIL can't live on his own and raise his son on his own, like millions of single parents around the world, do. \n\nYou need to be very firm here. This isn't something anyone can or should even try to guilt you into accepting. Especially if the house she wants to move them in is yours... she is delusional for thinking she could decide without you. \n\nDon't let this happen. It'll be a disaster and that's the last thing that little boy needs right now.", "NTA.\n\nPlenty of people, men and women, are single parents. They somehow manage. Most do a pretty good job of it too. There is no reason he needs to move in with his kid for more than a few days or maybe a few weeks while he's grieving. Beyond that, he needs to be in his own home with his kid and he needs to sort it out himself. You do not have to agree to take him in at the expense of your own lives. Sit your partner down and have a serious discussion. See if you can come to some agreement such as the kid can stay with you for x days in the summer break or they can come for Christmas. Something like that would be fine. NOT living there full time.", "NTA\n\nThis situation is going to ruin your relationship either way. You can decide if that happens now or after you have spent many years living with and supporting a stranger and his son. \n\nDo not get married or add her to the deed of your home until this situation is 100% resolved.\n\nETA\n\nSince there are 2 countries involved. Would you have to sponsor them to move to your country? That could put you on the hook for many years of financial support. If the living situation doesn\u2019t work out. You could still be responsible to financially support them. If you are in the US. You are responsible for at least 10 years.", "\nNTA and whilst this is a heartbreaking situation, your partner should have discussed this with you. She can\u2019t unilaterally make that decision and expect you to be fully on board with it.\n\nYou have some difficult conversations and decisions ahead.\n\nMy heart goes out to you both.", "NTA, which is kind of exemplified by the fact that you feel like you might BTA here.\n\nThis is heartbreaking, but they are also total strangers on you and this is being thrust into your life without so much as asking how you feel about it.\n\nChoosing to step up would certainly be noble, but just expecting you to do it like this is an unreasonable move.", "NTA. Your girlfriend signed both of you up for a role she did not consult with you. Wanting to help her nephew and BIL is not a bad thing. Opening up your home without your okay is. And expecting you to pay most of the bills is completely unfair when there will be 3 working adults in the house. \n\nI say that you\u2019d be paying the most because your girlfriend isn\u2019t really expecting BIL to pay her for the childcare she\u2019s going to provide or for any of the bills. With 3 adults in the house the bills should be split three ways. If your girlfriend won\u2019t compromise, it\u2019s time for you to start a new chapter.", "NTA \n\nA relationship is a team effort and your partner should not have made a decision this big by herself. Also, what she is planning to do doesn't really sound like co-parenting to me.", "NTA this is not something you just inform your partner of. This is several long hard conversations worth of decision making. There is an absolute 0% chance I would agree to this. You wanna live with your BIL and raise your nephew, cool. I'll be looking for a new place for me.", "NTA\n\nYou bought that apartment for your families future. Not for her to give away rooms freely, without prior discussions, for a undetermined amount of time.\n\nI get that she wants to help and be there for her nephew and BIL, but this isn't just her decision to make. It would be fine if she had her own place and could afford to do it, but the fact is she hasn't and can't afford to give up her second job, if she and you are already struggling now.\n\nIts going to be a difficult conversation, but it definitely needs to happen ASAP. Plenty of people are single parents and it's hard, but as long as you have support around you its fine, but there's a great difference between offering support and becoming a coparent.", "My nephews wife did that. I should say his first wife. She ended getting pregnant by the BIL and now they are married instead.", "NTA, mostly because, even though this is a horrible situation and your partner has a huge heart, they should have consulted you before making this massive of a decision. \nI think you\u2019re allowed to feel like you don\u2019t want to do it because it\u2019s  a) a massive commitment with no end date and no parameters set and b) if you aren\u2019t adequately consulted at the beginning stages, you likely won\u2019t for other major decisions, which is disrespectful and honestly, scary.", "NTA and you need to talk to her before they come over. You would be TA if you let them uproot before making your feelings about this clear.\n\nThis impacts your life for another 16 years and she should have run it by you first.", "NTA. She had no right to make that decision and offer without consulting you. I\u2019d say it\u2019s time to cut ties and move on.", "NTA This should have been a conversation yall had as partners before it was offered. You may have been able to come up with alternatives, or timelines for how long they'd be in the apartment (ie maybe they move closer to yall for the support,  but have their own place or within a few months, etc.) Also, she's giving up a job and you already don't have too much of the way in finances? Its giving good hearted and emotional, but not well thought out or even practical.", "NTA, if she won\u2019t see the light you need to see a divorce attorney if you\u2019re married.", "NTA", "NTA No. This is a both or none situation. She has zero right to offer up YOUR home that is in YOUR name (you said you bought it) without discussing it with you first. I\u2019m super sorry for her loss. But you need to put your foot down. If she feels the need to parent her nephew then she needs to make arrangements for that in her own home she owns or rents or she needs to move in with them. She doesn\u2019t get to make you financially responsible for her BIL and nephew without your permission. Full stop.", "NTA. She should have spoken to you about this first. This is a lot to expect especially if not talking about it first.", "Nope nta, you need to leave yesterday", "For her wanting to help or if the nephew had no parents I'd say N A H but the fact your partner agreed to move people in without discussing with you, NTA that's justified breaking up. I'm assuming the BIL is capable of parenting by himself. It's a nice idea, but it's one thing to throw the idea out there and another to just go ahead with a massive life change without your consent.", "NTA she should have spoken to you before making an offer like that. Since it\u2019s your home and will impact you then you should also get a say in whether that happens.", "Nta because why are u gonna have another man in your home and crap. Like???? She cam help with nephew but not have them live with yall. The hell. Red flags here", "INFO\n\nDo you own this apartment or are you renting it?\n\nBecause if YOU own the apartment then you need to sit down with your girlfriend and tell her point blank that she doesn't get to make relationship and life altering decisions like this without talking to you, nor does she get to invite people to live with you without asking if you are ok with it.\n\nAnd also, she doesn't get to volunteer your paycheck to subsidize their lives\n\nHonestly, this sounds like a relationship ender.  Either way, one of you is going to harbor MASSIVE resentment over this\n\nSo if you own the apartment in your name only, kindly tell her that if she insists on coparenting with her BIL she needs to move to where they live\n\nIf you rent, break the lease and move on\n\nOtherwise, you will be taking care of 2 adults and one child all on your own.  Because if you think for a second your girlfriend is going to prioritize her job over her sister's child...then you are mistaken", "NTA , you have the right to set boundaries and your environment is pretty fragile rn. However please don't close yourself to the opportunity of helping them temporally , the kid isn't in fault and they need help to take off. Sometimes you have to sacrifice your wellbeing to do the right thing. \n\nI'm pretty sorry to hear about your sister's sister condition and wish all of you can reach an agreement of what to do without deteriorating your current relationship", "Your partner has already chosen her nephew over you.  YTA if you don\u2019t see that and leave.", "Reading the title i thought YTA.\n\nBut reading the story no NTA \n\n>They'll move in with us, and she'll fulfill the role of mum by taking him to and from school, cooking for him etc while his dad goes to work.\n\nThat's dropping a big bomb on your relationship... Did you ask her what your role would be in this odd situation?", "NAH.  Your partner is trying to do what's best for her family, and my guess is that she's intent on doing it with or without you, because it's what's best for the young child who is about to lose his mother, and whom she obviously cares very deeply about.  But she shouldn't have sprung it on you.  This is the kind of thing that partners discuss before committing.", "NTA for not wanting to do this. But maybe try to have some compassion for your wife, BIL, and nephew. While you are not morally obligated to provide housing or parenting services that you didnt sign up for, everyone here is clearly going through something very tragic. Your wife has lost her sister, your BIL has lost his wife, and your nephew has lost his mom. It is completely understandable and valid that they would want to be together during this time.", "NAH. She should've included you in this decision, but her heart is in the right place. You also aren't wrong feeling what you feel. She clearly has made her choice and now you need to figure out if that's a life you want to be part of.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can understand wanting to help, but this is a serious change that needs discussion with the person you are living with before just deciding to do it in a shared space. A partnership means that you will both work together of course, but it doesn't mean that one of you decides to do something that causes this many life changes without discussing it first.", "NTA.  You should tell your partner how you feel immediately.  Then she will have to decide if she wants to stay with you, or move to be a parent to her nephew.  There is nothing wrong with her wanting to be involved in her nephew's life, but she can't just move him in with you without your consent.", "DUMP HER ASS!!!!! SHE AND HE ARE NOT WORTH IT!!!!!! NTA.", "NTA\n\n\nThey don't have to live there in order to co parent. Why does she want them to move in?", "You are NTA for not wanting to support your bil and his son while putting your future dreams of having children on hold indefinitely. However, it sounds like your partner has made up her mind. You have to decide whether you want to allow this to happen or go your own way. Good luck", "NTA\n\nWhat your girlfriend wants to do is very kind. However, she should have discussed this with you first, instead of promising to do this without even asking you how you felt. This is not acceptable.\n\nIf you really don't want this to happen, break up. They will portray you as an asshole for leaving your girlfriend while her sister is dying, but this would be 100% justified if you are not on board with this. Just be prepared for a lot of pressure and guilt tripping from your girlfriend and her family.\n\nWhy would single parenting be such a problem? Your partner's brother-in-law is an adult who should be able to be a single father. Plenty of parents end up as a single parent when their partner dies. As sad as it is, they manage to do just fine, with some support from family and friends. And who knows, maybe he might meet a new partner who can be a stepmother for the child.\n\nSadly, many men who have kids let their girlfriend/wife do all the dirty work and refuse to make any proper effort at parenting. Is your girlfriend's brother-in-law mostly doing this because he wants to let a woman, your girlfriend, do all the heavy parenting while he only does fun things on the weekends?\n\nIf you are not willing to accept this, leave. Let your girlfriend raise her nephew together with her brother-in-law, but you don't have to be involved.", "NTA think carefully about what you want your relationship to look like", "NTA. You're going to have to end this relationship if she insists on this.

She's giving up her second job for it.\n\nYou have never met these people and she wants to move them in, make you pay for it, they take up two rooms in your house and I promise you that your girlfriend will be looking at you to help manage them. \n\nIf the BIL moves in and your gf does everything, why would he leave? NTA.", "NTA.  Your partner had no business offering her BIL and his son to move into your home without discussing this with you first.  And tell her you do not want to live with BIL and son.  And you need to know for how long she plans to 'co-parent' because it sounds like she is planning a life with BIL instead of a life with you.  I suggest you start with that conversation.\n\nYou say you bought a 3 bedroom unit.  Did your partner contribute to the purchase?  Is she on the deed?  One option you have is to sell the place and buy yourself a one-bedroom unit.", "NAH\n\nShe made a unilateral decision and that was wrong, but she is likely afraid and grieving. You may hate this, but it\u2019s definitely time to redefine your relationship and see if it\u2019s worth having. She can support her nephew without trying to replicate being his mother and essentially playing wife to the childs father.", "ESH.  Partner for making all these decisions without your input, and you for putting \"possible future children\" above the child who needs you NOW.\n\nLet's be realistic, though - with a 3-bedroom unit, even if you & partner DID have a child together, the 2 kid''s could share a room.\n\nIf you are totally against living with her BIL & nephew (knowing she's clinging to them so she doesn't lose this last piece of her sister) - then you need to make it clear now.  Settle whatever finances you have in loving the housing, and let her get on with her life.", "Why not look into helping to pay for a nanny for BIL. Maybe the family can pool resources. Its got to be more cost effective then moving BIL and son into your flat.", "I also think the boy's father should weigh up the benefits of having a mother figure for his child vs. staying in a familiar environment. The kid is losing his mother, but now the father is going to take him away from his home (quite possibly the only home he's ever known), friends, support system, everything that is familiar to him, and move to a different country? That's a lot.", "Even if OP doesn\u2019t own the apartment or if they own it together she still doesn\u2019t get to make those decisions without discussions. My husband gets annoyed if I make dinner plans without discussing it with him LOL.

Not being them to a new COUNTRY and expect someone to provide for them without even discussing it.", "I don't know if her heart being in the right place really absolves OP's partner from being an asshole in this situation. \n\nIt's not like the partner's offer was something that only effects her. It drastically effects OP. \n\nTo not have discussed this with OP prior to making the offer is a huge asshole move imo", "He said he bought the unit with that many bedrooms so they could start a family together. \n\nHe had life plans she just unilaterally put a halt to.\n\nIt's his property from the post and she didn't even run it by him.", "I agree. I have the notion that this is a cultural issue. OP's partner seems to think it's completely normal to move her BIL and nephew in to serve as a co-parent and mother to them. And the BIL seems to be all too happy to do it. \n\nI can understand wanting and being willing to take a more active role in the little boy's life now her sister will sadly pass away at some point soon, but there is nothing remotely normal in the Western culture at least, about having to become a backup-mother and wife for the widowed BIL. \n\nI hope to be wrong, but it seems the BIL is ok with this because he would get to just dump a lot of the parenting onto OP's partner instead of having to figure it out alone.", "Maybe it's just me but I would also be at the very least super confused about how eager she is to part time another marriage and raising a kid, like maybe I'm just misreading how it's explained, but its wild.", "She's losing her sister, grieve is a mayor factor here. If she's never done anything like that before I think she isn't an AH.

She\u2019s bringing them to her home that is owned by OP and moving in a MAN and a child without even talking to OP about it.
