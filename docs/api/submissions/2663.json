Thanksgiving is coming and it's too soon after the conflict for me to be comfortable around him. WIBTA for opting out this year, or offering to celebrate with just my parents on another day?**\n\nMy brother and I are 8 years apart, I\u2019m older.  Since he was about 12 I have lived in another state.  We aren\u2019t close, but we hang out a few times a year and it\u2019s easy and fun.  I recently moved to the same city as he and my parents.  I envisioned us getting closer but it never really happened.  He\u2019s the king of \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow\u201d with zero follow-up.  It hurts my feelings, but I\u2019ve accepted it and take what I can get.    \n\nHe got married this past September.  I was told that there was no wedding party because his wife\u2019s family is too big for her to make a choice and she didn\u2019t want to leave people out.  I was given instructions to get a gray suit and that I\u2019d be given a blue tie for pictures. \n\nThe day of the wedding I was hanging out in the mens\u2019 dressing room and I saw that my brother has a gold tie.  And that his best friend has a gold tie.  And that his old bandmate has a gold tie.  Odd, but I didn\u2019t think too much of it.  \n\nThe ceremony started and I was sitting in the audience.  Lo and behold, the music starts and there\u2019s a procession.  My brother\u2019s two gold-tie friends walk in and line up on stage left, and his wife\u2019s sister and her husband walk in and line up on stage right.  The nonexistent wedding party.  At this point I have an almost out-of-body experience.  The ceremony was a blur.  After the ceremony we \u201ctook pictures\u201d which means I took one picture with my brother and that was it.  I spent the cocktail hour in a stall in the bathroom, embarrassed and hurt.  \n\nI made it through dinner ok, and instead of cake my brother had made a ton of his specialty cookies for dessert.  I\u2019m allergic to the recipe as-is, but with a simple tweak I can have them.  He didn\u2019t make any for me, or even warn me this was happening so I could bring my own dessert.  Anyways, I left the second dancing started.  And a week later sent the newlyweds a letter saying basically \u201cI thought things would improve once I moved here, but this wedding has shown me that we don\u2019t have a relationship outside holidays at mom and dad\u2019s house, so let\u2019s just keep it real and I will see you there, being disappointed all the time isn\u2019t healthy for either of us\u201d.  \n\nThe problem is that Thanksgiving is upon us, and not only will they be at my parents\u2019 house but they are bringing a couple of friends with them, so I will be really outnumbered and uncomfortable.  \n\n**WIBTA if I opt out for this one year, stating it\u2019s too fresh of a wound for me and I\u2019ll see y\u2019all at Christmas?**", "created_utc": 1668798972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yys33k/wibta_if_i_opt_out_of_thanksgiving_with_my/", "score": 1730, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Brother didn\u2019t want you in the wedding party because you\u2019re not close.  He didn\u2019t make you your own special cookies at his wedding because his wedding doesn\u2019t revolve around making sure you have a dessert.\n\nThe letter to the newlyweds was pettiness overkill, but hopefully you mean it and you finally accept that you can\u2019t force a close relationship just because you want it.", "Why do grown adults insist upon acting like children? ESH. He should have told you.  And don't act like you're being all mature saying you \"set a boundary.\" You made a sulking ultimatum because your brother didn't give you the fancy gold tie at the wedding.", "Nah\n\nYou don't need to go.\n\nBut your brother did nothing wrong. You do not need to put siblings in the wedding party just because. Je had the desserts je wanted for his wedding. Your allergies are bad for you but don't effect wedding deserts", "Eh, I say do what makes you comfortable, but I'm also a little surprised, not by the hurt, but by the level of it.\n\nI can see your being hurt and I definitely think your brother could have taken you into consideration more, but by your own account you aren't that close. Not in age or in experiences. You didn't grow up together, you don't have a very close bond, so I'm a little confused about why your quite this upset about it. I kind of agree on the wedding party, not really about you not being a part of it, but on them saying they weren't having one and then having one. That feels like an AH move. HOWEVER, I've definitely seen more than one wedding expand almost against all wills. They go from \"no wedding party, small ceremony, 20 ppl wedding breakfast\" to \"wedding party of a dozen, three flower girls, twin ring-dog-walkers wear the ring is on the doggie collar, 300 person ceremony and reception. In Maui.\" It happens. And sometimes one sibling is basically the wedding planner and another is just a guest. It happens. It doesn't necessarily mean your brother doesn't love you, it just might mean you're not close enough for him to know these things would matter to you at his wedding, so he doesn't/didn't think to keep you apprised of any changes. It's a shame he didn't make cookies for you, but again, if you're not close, that just may not have been a priority on his mind. Maybe he didn't think dessert was a big deal. Maybe there were candies or fruit that you can have and he figured you'd eat that if you wanted something sweet after dinner.\n\nI sympathize with your feelings, but I'm not sure sending the note and then bowing out of big family gatherings is going to help exactly. It certainly doesn't seem to have lessened your hurt or anger yet. It might help more to schedule a one-on-one outing with him and work your way around to explaining how/why you were hurt at the wedding and that you would appreciate being taken more into consideration in the future.", "Yta- I\u2019m sorry but you need to get a grip.\n I would understand if you and your brother were super close and he did this but you\u2019re not.\n\nYou guys don\u2019t have a close relationship.\n\nYou moved out of state during your brother\u2019s  formative years. He didn\u2019t grow up with you,plus there\u2019s an almost ten year age gap between you .  And again , you guys aren\u2019t close .\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you expected to be made part of the wedding party and get so upset about it that you threw a tantrum and sulked in the bathroom . \n\nAnd now another tantrum for Thanksgiving.  \n\n\u201c but they are bringing a couple of friends with them, so I will be really outnumbered and uncomfortable.\u201d   \n\nOutnumbered ? From what ? Are you going into battle??  Now your brother isn\u2019t allowed to bring friends because it hurts your feeling too so you\u2019re going to not go.

It's sad, but you can't force something that isn't there. \n\nWhere it really sucks is that he deliberately lied to you and misled you about the wedding. And telling you what color suit and tie to wear just for photos is weird.\n\nUntil you can accept he doesn't want the same kind of relationship with you as you'd like, then you need to do what you need to do.", "NAH, I think you just really over think things at times and try too hard with your brother.", "Very soft YTA.\n\nYou moved away when he was 12 and you were 20. You're not close and just because you  moved back doesn't mean that is going to change overnight.\n\nBeing close is a two way street and it seems that you aren't willing to put the time in either unless you get immediate reward for it (in terms of being asked to be in a very small wedding party for a family member you admit you aren't close with yet)", "ESH. Your brother lied but you admit you aren\u2019t that close.", "Yta", "Seems like it's a you problem. I'm not sure your brother is even aware there is a problem. \n\nYou want a closer relationship with your brother but it sounds like you expect him to make all the effort.

The effort", "YTA.\n\nI read the title and assumed he hadn\u2019t invited you. He didn\u2019t leave you out of the wedding. He just didn\u2019t make you a groomsman. You\u2019re going to decide to not see your parents for an important holiday, damaging your relationship with them, because a brother who you aren\u2019t close to invited you to his wedding but didn\u2019t give you a special role?\n\nIf you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s past the point of trying to make this an important relationship, why give it so much of your attention? Why give up thanksgiving with your parents because of him?", "ESH -  Your brother sucks for lying about not having a wedding party. IDK why he thought he would get away with that one.  You suck for thinking that magically a relationship is going to develop because you suddenly move closer.  \n\nFirst, just because you want a relationship, doesn\u2019t mean he does.  Second, in your email, which I have a problem with, you state your relationship is done except for holidays at your parents and now you\u2019re skipping out of holidays with your parents?  Sounds like your relationship with your brother has been constant for over a decade and now you\u2019re upset about it.   \n\nI wonder how much your brother looked up to you growing up and how much you ignored him.", "I'm struggling to see what the issue is here.  You already stated that you and your brother aren't really close, so the gold tie/blue tie... maybe not so surprising?  \"I envisioned us getting closer but it never really happened\" does sum that up.\n\nYou've both never been close so the gold tie/blue tie... you're not in the \"inner circle\" per se with a brother you've never really been close too.\n\nGranted, that can still hurt when you're family by blood, but if you don't really have a solid relationship it might not be that much of an issue...at least to your brother.\n\nWhether you turn up to thanksgiving or not is really up to you. You're not an AH either way.  If something like this has effected you then might be worth bringing it up with your brother... yet if you already admit that you're not that close then perhaps it's not as big an issue that it needs to be.", "YTA and I'd suggest therapy to deal with your issues. Yall aren't close, have never been close as adults or even as kids, lived away from the family and you expected to be in his small wedding party. Yeah he should have been upfront about it with you but man you have some major overreactions. Stay away from thanksgiving if you want but man get help.", "Going against the grain here with NTA. He lied about no wedding party. Why? If you two are not that close, you did not expect to be asked did you? Lots of people don't have their siblings in the wedding party but it's just strange to flat-out lie about it. Did he think you wouldn't notice? He told you a specific color suit to wear and that you would be given a tie for pictures. Again why? If you're not in the wedding party why does the color suit and tie you are wearing matter? \n\nAlso, he didn't make sure there was a dessert you could eat. I know \"it's his wedding day\" blah, blah but he wasn't making the cookies the day of and he could have made a couple for his brother. \n\nI think part of this is simply you were not a part of his life for awhile so a close, brotherly bond did not form or some siblings are fine with each other but not close. If going to Thanksgiving would upset you, then don't go. You do not have to put yourself in optional situations that will cause you distress. He has not  shown that he wants to a closer relationship. He LIED to you about his wedding. I'd skip Thanksgiving, try Christmas and just start making friends and having a life. You'll find your people.", "Christ in a cracker, what did I just read?! \n\nYou seem to have convinced yourself that moving to the same town as your brother entitles you to a close relationship with him. It does not. \n\n> this wedding has shown me that we don\u2019t have a relationship outside holidays at mom and dad\u2019s house\n\nYou already knew the type of relationship you and your brother have. You moved away when you were 20 and he was 12. He may not want a close relationship with you, and while that sucks, you have to respect that. \n\nYou had a temper tantrum because you weren\u2019t in a very small wedding party. Which are usually reserved for those we are closest with. That wouldn\u2019t be you. It sucks they lied, but that\u2019s the only thing your brother did wrong. \n\n> He didn\u2019t even make any for me\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, there is not one single person on this planet who is entitled to dessert. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t close, maybe he forgot about your allergy. He made the dessert for his wedding himself. Maybe he had a lot going on and totally forgot in his busyness. \n\nSurely your mom and dad knew about the cookies. They could have given you a heads up, so you might want to be upset with them as well. \n\nThe long and short of it is, it was your brother\u2019s wedding. You were included, just not as much as you believe you deserve for some reason. Nothing on that day was about you. \n\nYTA and from the sound of it, an exhausting one.", "NTA, their wedding isn\u2019t about you, but the number of lies/miscommunication to sideline you is wild. I feel like we\u2019re missing some other details about your relationship with your brother, but still going with not an AH. The letter to them after the wedding was an aggressive unnecessary move, tbh", "NTA, you don't have to go if you don't want to and you don't have to force yourself to have a good relationship with \"family\" who don't want to put the effort in. Maybe he just doesn't like you and it's a none personal thing, you've just grown up out of his life.", "YTA. Your brother wasn\u2019t obligated to have you in his wedding, period. He should have been straight with you about having groomsmen but he was likely afraid you\u2019d react badly, which you did. You \u201cestablished a boundary\u201d because you didn\u2019t get to be in his wedding? That\u2019s ridiculous, especially since you aren\u2019t close and didn\u2019t really grow up with him.", "I\u2019m sorry but yeah YTA. You admit that you\u2019ve not lived in the same state as your brother since he was 12, and now you\u2019ve moved back you expected to what be best man at his wedding. You be his best friend and want to hang all the time? He has his own life and own friends.", "NTA for not going but YTA for your behavior surrounding the wedding.  You locked yourself on the bathroom stall for an hour?!   \n\nSiblings do not equal auto best friends and it sounds like you moved back into town and expected him to center you in his life.  This isn\u2019t reasonable or particularly mature.", "It seems like you have hurt feelings which is fine but I think your actions are closing in on AH territory. You moved away when he was 12 and you aren't going to magically be close overnight. Wanting a close relationship with your brother isn't wrong it's just going to work. You're practically strangers at the moment. And you're acting like you've been alighted by a close friend. \n\nDoes your brother know you have allergies? Did you mention it to him any time between when he got engaged and the wedding?\n\n>I was told that there was no wedding party because his wife\u2019s family is too big for her to make a choice and she didn\u2019t want to leave people out. I was given instructions to get a gray suit and that I\u2019d be given a blue tie for pictures. \n\nNow this is odd. Did you expect to be a groomsman? Again you're not close and while some people would include siblings out of obligation many people only have people actually close to them in their wedding party. It's also possible that the wedding party planned changed but since you aren't close you weren't on the short list for groomsman.", "Yta he didn\u2019t need to include you in the wedding party. You are making their wedding about you and acting like a petulant child who didn\u2019t get his way so you throw a temper tantrum", "<<so let\u2019s just keep it real and I will see you there>>\n \nESH, you and your brother both suck here. \n\nYou said you were willing to see each other at family holidays, and now you're instead choosing to skip the event altogether, which punishes your parents and is frankly just childish.\n\nYour brother doesn't owe you a place in his wedding party. But he should have been honest about it.", "NAH.  You don't want to go,  don't go.  You were at the wedding,  just didn't have the role you expected, so I don't think brother is AH either.", "YTA. it sounds like their \"wedding party\" was just a few people who are very close to them. it's completely unreasonable for you to hold a grudge over this. learn to let the little things go.", "Nta. \nEven though you are not close with a sibling, you should at least include them in major events in life. That's what i believe. Op tried to form a relationship with him btw was treated like a complete stranger. Thats why op is hurt. And he has the right to be hurt. About the Allergy thing op's brother should have notice it. Siblings are related by blood even though they live far btw we do have memories with them.Everyone will give judgments based on their experience. If my brother acted this way i would be hurt. And about the thanksgiving day op if you want to see your parents you should go. You will be visiting your parents not your brother just act civil. No need to try to get to know them or want a apology. Just act they are invisible. You can take a friend if you want to. Or you can visit them other day. Don't give your brother so much attention op cz in the end they Won't care about your feelings", "NTA. Your feelings are real. You get to decide if it's too painful for you.\n\nBut.... it's not unusual for people to choose friends to be in their wedding party, especially if they aren't close (physically or geographically) to family members. I can't believe anyone was looking at you and thinking \"what a loser, his brother didn't ask him to be in the wedding party\". \n\nYes, you get to opt out if you really think it's too painful. But be aware that this will probably be seen as you trying to create drama. I doubt if the your brother or anyone else will think \"wow, I didn't realize how badly he was hurt, I was really terrible to him\". They'll just think you need to get over it. Which is what I think: I'm sorry this hurt you, but it will be better for you if you can try to let this go. Maybe you and your brother can be closer in the future, maybe not, but making an issue out of this isn't going to endear you to him.", "ESH, but a little heavier toward the YTA. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t owe you a place in the wedding.  You said yourself that you\u2019ve never been close. \n\nHowever, he\u2019s a little bit TA for lying about it instead of telling you the truth from the beginning so you would have time to process the hurt before the wedding.", "INFO. What was your brother's reaction to your letter? And what was your parents' reaction?\n\nWith current info, I'd say a soft ESH. You shouldn't expect to be a part of his wedding party, he shouldn't have lied. Yes, he and his bride could have made something you could eat, but he may not have been involved in the catering, and it honestly doesn't sound like you guys are close. You are not obligated to go to Thanksgiving, but this is something you should have considered a while ago. I'd suggest going, but having a ready made excuse. Think of them as cousins you are visiting, worthy of polite conversation, but not a lot of effort.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to hang out with people that lie to you.", "NTA - You would not be the AH for skipping Thanksgiving. However, your brother is only the AH in this situation because he lied about the wedding party. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong by only including the people he was close to in the wedding party.", "YTA. You were the adult when he was the child, and didn\u2019t make an effort to be close to him. You moved back recently and still weren\u2019t close. Of course he would want people he\u2019s close to in his wedding party, not a sibling with whom he has no relationship. I understand that you we hurt, but that\u2019s no reason to make drama or take it out on him. You want to declare that you\u2019re \u201cwounded?\u201d That\u2019s foolish. You wanted to be close but now you want to cut him off? It sounds like you\u2019ve never been willing to put in the work to have an actual relationship with your brother. And now you want to make it awkward for the rest of your family. This very much sounds like a case of you having a very fragile ego.", "YTA - the title made it sound like you weren\u2019t invited to the wedding at all but you just weren\u2019t in the bridal party? Y\u2019all aren\u2019t close, since he was 12 you have lived away from him, you weren\u2019t there for his big life milestones! It sounds like their bridal party was very small. You are making a mountain out of nothing!!", "YTA- It wasn't your big day, it was your brothers and its their choice of who they want in their wedding.  I wasn't in my brothers wedding, but his wife's family was and he was more active in mine (we literally only had a maid of honor and best man), sometimes you just have to let things go move on.  There is no reason to be embarrassed by it though,  that is confusing to me as to why you were", "YTA. And here\u2019s why:\n\nDid you express that you would like to use the opportunity of moving closer to your brother as a way to get closer? Was he aware that you were upset about the wedding situation outside of your passive aggressive letter? \n\nBy your own admission you said you weren\u2019t close\u2026.so it\u2019s odd you\u2019d be shocked you weren\u2019t chosen for the wedding party - however informal it may be. \n\nI get that having allergies at events sucks but the groom made the dessert for his own wedding\u2026. If this was your wedding, fair enough but the day isn\u2019t really about you. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if you are too hurt to attend Thanksgiving but I think you could use it as an opportunity to rekindle the relationship and start fresh.", "YTA. \n\nYou admitted that you\u2019re not close to your brother because you moved away when he was a kid. You don\u2019t have a close relationship now. He shouldn\u2019t have lied that there was no wedding party, but adding you to the party might have been what would have caused the issue with her having to choose from her family. Ultimately, you are not entitled to being in the wedding party just because you share parents. You\u2019re the only one with an issue here, and you\u2019re turning a non-conflict into an ordeal that includes missing out on family events where you could potentially become closer. That\u2019s on you. \n\nTherapy is a great place to process your hurt feelings.", "A little bit YTA. I understand your feelings are hurt but there is quite a large gap in your ages and being far away for so long means the two of you don't actually know each other all that well. It's very unrealistic of you to expect to have the kind of relationship with him that does in fact take years to develop, as soon as you return. Skipping Thanksgiving is not going to help develop that either. Spending time together is how that happens. You were at the wedding, in that respect you may be acting a bit melodramatic.", "NTA. Seems your brother lied to you about the big day and didn't have an ounce of remorse. If you're still trying to calm down from that and go it'll just turn your parents' house into a battleground. I don't think you'd want to subject your parents to outright aggression. Maybe visit sometime before or after Thanksgiving when your brother isn't there.", "NTA, do what makes you comfortable", "INFO: How did they respond to your letter?\n\nAs someone with ADHD who really struggles with RSD sometimes, you\u2019re not an AH for being upset but you might want to look into therapy or other ways to help when things feel really hurtful.\n\nIf you and your brother aren\u2019t close and they decided to keep the wedding party super small then it\u2019s not surprising he went with two close friends.  Idk if he purposely lied about it, but it\u2019s possible that they just changed their minds.  Planning a wedding is usually hectic and stressful.  It\u2019s supposed to be about the couple getting married, but there\u2019s often hundreds of outside opinions/expectations that you have to deal with too.  I highly doubt your brother was purposely slighting you.  It was his wedding, not yours, so of course he prioritized himself instead of you.  You can be hurt, but it\u2019s unreasonable for you to hold it against him.", "YTA, it sounds like you wanted the wedding about you and the attention of being the groom\u2019s brother? You\u2019re admittedly not close and were not around for at least a third of his life. It sounds like you had a major overreaction. A lot of people don\u2019t even care about desert at a wedding, but you expected special desert just for you. Weird thing to get upset about, when they probably spent lots of money, planning, and stress on organizing a wedding to be expected to cater to a brother who the groom didn\u2019t have a relationship with for years. And then while they should be living the newlywed life, you sent them a passive aggressive letter. You chose to move away. You don\u2019t get to have a brotherly relationship by declaring you want one. And if it is truly important to you, you\u2019re not going about it the right way to make it happen.", "You don't have to go. But your brother did  othing wrong. Just in case you weren't aware, it was his wedding day, he could have whoever he wanted up front with him, and he could serve whatever he wanted as dessert. You sound like a petulant child. Hiding  in the bathroom  was silly, no one would have thought anything of it that he chose two best friends as groomsmen. People need to stop expecting siblings to include them in their wedding party purely because they are siblings", "Soft YTA. By your own admission you're not close, don't see each other often, and there's an age gap so I assume you didn't overlap at home for very long. Should he have been upfront with you about the wedding party? Yes. But he was under no obligation to include you.", "ESH\n\nYour brother should have handled the wedding better with regards to the wedding party.  All he had to say was \"We're keeping it very small and not really doing a traditional wedding \"party\".  I'm only going to have my two best men, and she's only going to have her sister and husband as her matron/man of honor.\"  Why lie?  \n\nBut man, you took it WAY too personally for a day that is ultimately *not about you*.  Y'all are not close, never have been, but you're having a meltdown over not being in the wedding party?  Sibling or not, you should never expect to be in a wedding party of someone you're not close to.  I understand why his lie hurt, but hiding in a stall in the bathroom because you, a grown man, can't handle not being in the wedding party of a sibling you aren't close to? Come on.  And you are ONE GUEST.  They aren't going to make a special dessert just for you.  It's dessert.  It's not essential.  You were not harmed by not having dessert for one night.

It was understandably probably quite low on their priority list.  \n\nAnd then the letter.  You ever think the reason your brother isn't super interested in a deeper relationship with you is because you handle problems like a middle schooler instead of having a conversation about it like an adult?  I don't have time for adults who write me petty letters either.  Invite me over for coffee and talk to me like an adult, call me on the phone, whatever is possible, but give me a chance to talk it out and give my side.    \n\nLook, your brother isn't obligated to give you the relationship you want with him.  This is the relationship he is interested in having.  You need to come to terms with that and move forward, one way or another.  And you need to do it in an adult manner, so stop with the middle school meltdowns every time other people don't give you what you want from them.

We saw each other on occasion, and loved each other, but that relationship of siblings was permanently broken by distance (this was before smartphones etc).\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten a little bit closer with many modes of communication at our disposal, but I would never expect that he would ask me to be a part of his wedding party. \n\nI\u2019m going to assume most of this hurt is coming from a feeling of being lied to, which is why your brother sucks too, he should of sucked it up and just told you\u2014\n\n\u2014 but for you to have this expectation to be in his party when you made it clear you\u2019re basically pen pals is unrealistic.

I don't think you say current ages or how long you lived elsewhere, but it's at least 6 years if he got married. \n\nSo...a third or better of his life you weren't around. Now that you've decided you want to be close, he's not interested. It happens. \n\nYou seem to regret this. Again, it happens. \n\nYall are siblings, not friends. He shouldn't have lied about not having a wedding party, you shouldn't have sent him a letter that reads as an attempted guilt trip, but meh. \n\nDoes seem like there may be some relevant backstory missing, but I don't think it'd really change my opinion. Yall are siblings, not friends, and from what's presented nothing screams AH, just uninterested (him) and vaguely hurt because of it (you).\n\nEdit: oh, I forgot to specify why the NAH re: Thanksgiving- so long as you aren't pouty or make drama for your parents, going to a family event is your choice. I'd personally suggest you just go and get it over with if this is really all the 'problem' with it tho. Otherwise you may find it's still fresh come Christmas, and the summer holidays you may as well spend with friends anyway, they aren't really 'family' days, and man... this is awkward, we're back at Thanksgiving again and everyone is going to think I've spent the past year sulking.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thanksgiving is coming and it's too soon after the conflict for me to be comfortable around him. WIBTA for opting out this year, or offering to celebrate with just my parents on another day?\n\nMy brother and I are 8 years apart, I\u2019m older.  Since he was about 12 I have lived in another state.  We aren\u2019t close, but we hang out a few times a year and it\u2019s easy and fun.  I recently moved to the same city as he and my parents.  I envisioned us getting closer but it never really happened.  He\u2019s the king of \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow\u201d with zero follow-up.  It hurts my feelings, but I\u2019ve accepted it and take what I can get.    \n\nHe got married this past September.  I was told that there was no wedding party because his wife\u2019s family is too big for her to make a choice and she didn\u2019t want to leave people out.  I was given instructions to get a gray suit and that I\u2019d be given a blue tie for pictures. \n\nThe day of the wedding I was hanging out in the mens\u2019 dressing room and I saw that my brother has a gold tie.  And that his best friend has a gold tie.  And that his old bandmate has a gold tie.  Odd, but I didn\u2019t think too much of it.  \n\nThe ceremony started and I was sitting in the audience.  Lo and behold, the music starts and there\u2019s a procession.  My brother\u2019s two gold-tie friends walk in and line up on stage left, and his wife\u2019s sister and her husband walk in and line up on stage right.  The nonexistent wedding party.  At this point I have an almost out-of-body experience.  The ceremony was a blur.  After the ceremony we \u201ctook pictures\u201d which means I took one picture with my brother and that was it.  I spent the cocktail hour in a stall in the bathroom, embarrassed and hurt.  \n\nI made it through dinner ok, and instead of cake my brother had made a ton of his specialty cookies for dessert.  I\u2019m allergic to the recipe as-is, but with a simple tweak I can have them.  He didn\u2019t make any for me, or even warn me this was happening so I could bring my own dessert.  Anyways, I left the second dancing started.  And a week later sent the newlyweds a letter saying basically \u201cI thought things would improve once I moved here, but this wedding has shown me that we don\u2019t have a relationship outside holidays at mom and dad\u2019s house, so let\u2019s just keep it real and I will see you there, being disappointed all the time isn\u2019t healthy for either of us\u201d.  \n\nThe problem is that Thanksgiving is upon us, and not only will they be at my parents\u2019 house but they are bringing a couple of friends with them, so I will be really outnumbered and uncomfortable.  \n\n**WIBTA if I opt out for this one year, stating it\u2019s too fresh of a wound for me and I\u2019ll see y\u2019all at Christmas?**\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Their wedding isn't about you.\n\nIf they started doing what you said, like not putting dairy on two of these cookies, then other people are going to expect that they accommodate their dietary restrictions for some dishes and then it becomes a logistical nightmare to deal with, not to mention the additional costs from the caterer.", "200 cookies, so I assume it\u2019s a big wedding.  He probably has bigger things to think about other than if you want a cookie, get over yourself, sounds like your brother won\u2019t even notice if you show up to thanksgiving", "Is the cream in a topping?  If so, that's a reasonable request.\n\nBut if this is an ingredient in the dough, then what you're actually asking for is for him to make you a special BATCH.  That's more likely 12 ish cookies, and since when people make cookies in bulk they generally prep the dough all at once and then just bake, you're also asking him to double his prep time and space needs.  Not only that, you can't just remove an ingredient from a recipe without ruining it.  He would need to *sub* something in place of that cream, and substitutions are trickier than you think.  It's very understandable why a person baking 200 cookies for their own wedding wouldn't have the time, space, or inclination to accommodate a single guest's dietary restrictions. When you don't have a commercial kitchen, a bulk bake is challenging enough and a special batch may just be outside your capabilities. Plus if you don't have a ready substitution for a particular ingredient, you'll probably need a bake or two to get the substitution right.  That's a lot.  And for something like dessert, which not everyone eats anyway, I wouldn't say they're really required to.", "Yeah maybe that would be better but probably figured if told in advance there would have been a massive hissy fit all the way to the wedding", "I don\u2019t think he read this at all.

It\u2019s clear you care about and want to be closer to your immediate family, and that thinks haven\u2019t shaken out as you expected them to. But I think at the wedding you chose to take things personally that were not slights against you.\n\nYour brother\u2019s wedding wasn\u2019t about you or his relationship with you. I thought your story was going to be that other siblings (like you and your brother\u2019s other siblings) were in the wedding party and you weren\u2019t given a heads up. They each had just two attendants, and your brother picked two people he clearly is socially closer to than your relationship. That\u2019s\u2026 not a crime. And it\u2019s not a slight. You were in the dressing room; that means you\u2019re close to the groom. Not being in the wedding when the wedding party is that small is not a surprise.\n\nThem not having a separate dessert to accommodate you is just something that sometimes happens at weddings. If they chose a different dessert that you weren\u2019t allergic to, but wasn\u2019t something you liked, it wouldn\u2019t be a slight against you. If they were serving peanut butter cookies and you whipped out a slice of cherry pie because you can\u2019t handle not having dessert, that would have been weird (and in my view, immature). It\u2019s not the same as not honoring food allergies at dinner. You\u2019re a grown up, and they were just cookies.\n\nI would almost say Y T A for that dramatic response afterward, but that\u2019s not the question at hand.\n\nIf you want to be closer to your brother, you should go to Thanksgiving. That\u2019s how you can start building a relationship. Rejecting him out of hand because your feelings were hurt will not bring you closer together.", "I'm sorry if this is hard to accept, but \"I wouldn't treat him that way,\" is not actually a valid standard to hold other people to.

This is an issue with distance and familiarity. I have a similar issue with my brother, who, despite all the effort I've placed through the years, we'll never be close, and I've learned not to take anything he says or does personally. \n\nBecause of the distance, living in another state, and the age difference, it's natural for you not to be at the front of his mind. On top of that, planning a wedding involves a lot of stress and hard work, so not thinking about your dietary restrictions comes as no surprise. I was so busy worrying about the details of my wedding that I forgot my dad was allergic to coconut and almost sent him to the emergency room on the day of the wedding. The point is, that it's easy to miss the most obvious details when planning a wedding. \n\nThat being said, *your brother should never have lied to you about the wedding party or talked to you about the decision beforehand to avoid the shock on the day off.* I feel your pain and see your wish to have a better relationship with him, but the way I see it, the ball is in his court now. You've made an effort and communicated your disappointment with him, so the best you can do is give him as much space as possible and live your life, trying not to let his attitude and neglect get to you. I know it's much easier said than done, but trust me, once you've embraced that sharing DNA does not make him \"family,\" you can set aside the negative feelings and be free from needing validation from him. Also, being cordial during family events, no longer reaching out, and being detached emotionally from him, will send him a strong message to either make an effort or never have a relationship. Showing indifference is the loudest action you can take without causing drama or making the issue worse. \n\n*Regarding thanksgiving, you should go despite the possibility of being uncomfortable.* Don't let this issue, which may be minor to him, grow and fester into a larger problem that may accidentally drag your parents or other family members into it. By not going, you are now involving more people, forcing your folks to take sides or alter future events, and the rift will become obvious to everyone. \n\nYou don't want your family or anyone else getting in the middle and accusing you of being the hostile one. Go to the dinner. *Bring a SO, friend, friendly cousin, or coworker to the dinner to avoid drama or conversation about the topic and act like there is no problem;* smile, be polite but keep your answers short don't ask him anything about his life, and treat him the way you would treat a coworker. Leave early and with a smile. Send a nice message after the dinner to everyone you saw there but not to your brother and his wife. This will send a message which will make you feel better about the situation but will remove any blame from you. \n\nIf you don't go, you are taking a large and very public action that may miscommunicate your intent and paint your pain as immature and petty. Also, it will establish a precedent and cause more of a rift. The more paranoid part of me also thinks that there is a chance that the situation might be discussed during dinner, with only your brother's side being shared. Your actions will be remembered by everyone, and you want to come out having taken the higher road and with no regrets or the possibility of idle gossip. **You made an effort, showed up, and no one can say anything negative about your actions.** By showing up, you avoid the possibility of negative backlash, and who knows? Maybe things will start getting better from that point on. However, if you don't go, you only leave yourself open to making things worse between you two.  \n\nJust my two cents. \n\n**TLDR:**  NAH - but by not going, you make yourself look bad to your family and create an uncomfortable situation for everyone. **Go to the dinner,** avoid drama, and take a friend or a couple of friends to act as buffers, make you feel more comfortable, and act cordial to your brother.", "After thinking about it, I\u2019m going to say YTA here.  I acknowledge that your brother being dishonest rather than straight up telling you he had chosen his friends to be in his wedding party was hurtful.  But your overreaction to not being in his wedding party kind of justifies why he chose to lie, from my perspective.  \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the lie that really bothers you.  I suspect your real hurt comes from the fact that he didn\u2019t include you in his wedding. But, since you acknowledged that your relationship with him isn\u2019t close, it shouldn\u2019t have been terribly surprising that he had two people he felt closer to than you.  Being his brother doesn\u2019t entitle you to special wedding party consideration.  (Especially since you were largely absent for an extended period of time of his life.) So you being blindsided to the point of hiding in the bathroom and bailing early is pretty over the top for what you should have only considered a slight because of his dishonesty.  His wedding isn\u2019t about his relationship with you, but I think you wanted it to be, and that\u2019s why you were so hurt by being excluded.  Also why the cookie thing even sticks in your mind.  Not only was it unnecessary for him to go to the trouble of making a special batch of cookies just because you are allergic\u2026on a day that is already stressful for him\u2026it is ENTIRELY unnecessary to tell you in advance so you can \u201dbring your own dessert.\u201d  (who even does that?

It hurt to feel so excluded on the day itself.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long road processing that someone I love and care so much for is so indifferent towards me. I think setting up boundaries and not participating in situations that will make you uncomfortable is fine to do. But you should ask yourself who you\u2019re actually punishing. Will you be missing your family on thanksgiving? Not to be harsh, but if the intention is to make him realize he\u2019s a bad brother or to feel remorse, it likely won\u2019t happen.

Plus, they're 8 years apart and were never close, so why is OP expecting to be in the wedding party?\n\nMy brother and I are 10 years apart (I'm the youngest.) I was not in his wedding and he wasn't in mine. Nobody got upset. We weren't especially close growing up but have become much closer as we age. Our parents have passed on. So it's just us. We are closer now than ever. When my husband died my brother and his wife have been there for me every step of the way even though we're 1,500miles apart. We made sure we were in touch over the years.  I see no evidence that OP has done much to reach out and kindle a relationship. Grow up, OP, and go to Thanksgiving with your family.

Whatever you had in your mind for his wedding just didn\u2019t happen. I would be upset about the lies about not having a wedding party but come on man. You guys are just brothers that don\u2019t talk. Most families have them but you are taking away from being with your parents.

Sorry and I hope you work out your issues with your family.", "My brother is 8 years younger than I am. He ended up in my husband's wedding party because we lived with my parents for some time before getting married. My husband's sister, who had moved for school before we met, did a reading at our wedding but wasn't in the party. I was not in my brother's wedding, nor in my SIL's. Nobody pitched a whiny \"I'm so hurt\" fest about whether they were included or to what extent. \nHonestly, your behavior is childish and petulant. I'd be curious to know how much effort YOU put into being closer with your brother? Because you make it sound like you expect him to put in all the work here, and cater to you, when you admittedly haven't really been part of his most formative years. \nI call YTA for your excuses, but honestly, if you're going to just be a toddler about the situation, yeah, skip the family event so you don't bring it down for others.", "I think when you moved away, your brother created a whole life for himself. He loves you but cannot count on you to not leave. Not that it was wrong for you to leave but at a young age, those things can affect our psyche. It also depends on how as the older one, you handled being gone. Did you check on him with regular I love you\u2019s and want you in my life kind of check in. Or did you go, do your think, and then came back expecting some kind of reconnection? Those things affect your relationship now. Introspect, if you didn\u2019t do all the things needed to keep that relationship going when he was 12, you are basically a stranger with the same genes at this point and need to start all over again to build a relationship but at his pace, not your pace because again, he built a life for himself with you gone not counting on you ever coming back. Your expectations were too high coming back, like you would pick up where you left off when he was 12. It doesn\u2019t work that way. The whole weeding things was petty as hell, you expected way too much too soon. Start slow, go to the thanksgiving get together, build those relationships, don\u2019t expect to have his undivided attention but spend time with your parents and your brother without expecting too much.

It's customary, but it isn't a requirement. And honestly, it doesn't sound like they had an elaborate wedding. You were in the family photo. Sure, it sucks to realize that the person you share the most DNA with isn't super interested in you, but you sort of missed your chance. Over a day that was still pretty hectic, about his growing family (usually brothers don't have much of a part to play in the sibling's relationship), and then sent a nastygram that it wasn't about you.

With that said I would also go to Thanksgiving and tell your brother that you love him and are always there for him but don\u2019t pressure him towards action, tell him how to live his life or request a deeper relationship.

He is significantly older than his sibling, left home when sibling was young, and admittedly doesnt have a close relationship with them. The fact that he felt \"humiliated\" at not being a groomsman, hid in a bathroom, left early, and then sent a passive aggressive text is just so extra and self centered. I guarantee not a single other person had a thought about OP not being in the wedding party, so what is there to be humiliated at? Nothing. The issue is all in his head, and he is basically cutting off his nose to spite his face by not going to Thanksgiving.

You\u2019re making your brother\u2019s wedding about you, and it\u2019s NOT about you. At all. Sending him a letter is honestly a great way to burn the bridge between you and your brother and never make sure you never have a relationship with he and his wife or your future nieces and nephews. It\u2019s also a good way to alienate your parents, since they now can\u2019t see both sons on the same day at the same time through no fault of their own.", "So was he supposed to look sad and dazed in front of everyone?

That almost seems worse to me."]}
