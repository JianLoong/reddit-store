Thanksgiving is coming and it's too soon after the conflict for me to be comfortable around him. WIBTA for opting out this year, or offering to celebrate with just my parents on another day?**\n\nMy brother and I are 8 years apart, I\u2019m older.  Since he was about 12 I have lived in another state.  We aren\u2019t close, but we hang out a few times a year and it\u2019s easy and fun.  I recently moved to the same city as he and my parents.  I envisioned us getting closer but it never really happened.  He\u2019s the king of \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow\u201d with zero follow-up.  It hurts my feelings, but I\u2019ve accepted it and take what I can get.    \n\nHe got married this past September.  I was told that there was no wedding party because his wife\u2019s family is too big for her to make a choice and she didn\u2019t want to leave people out.  I was given instructions to get a gray suit and that I\u2019d be given a blue tie for pictures. \n\nThe day of the wedding I was hanging out in the mens\u2019 dressing room and I saw that my brother has a gold tie.  And that his best friend has a gold tie.  And that his old bandmate has a gold tie.  Odd, but I didn\u2019t think too much of it.  \n\nThe ceremony started and I was sitting in the audience.  Lo and behold, the music starts and there\u2019s a procession.  My brother\u2019s two gold-tie friends walk in and line up on stage left, and his wife\u2019s sister and her husband walk in and line up on stage right.  The nonexistent wedding party.  At this point I have an almost out-of-body experience.  The ceremony was a blur.  After the ceremony we \u201ctook pictures\u201d which means I took one picture with my brother and that was it.  I spent the cocktail hour in a stall in the bathroom, embarrassed and hurt.  \n\nI made it through dinner ok, and instead of cake my brother had made a ton of his specialty cookies for dessert.  I\u2019m allergic to the recipe as-is, but with a simple tweak I can have them.  He didn\u2019t make any for me, or even warn me this was happening so I could bring my own dessert.  Anyways, I left the second dancing started.  And a week later sent the newlyweds a letter saying basically \u201cI thought things would improve once I moved here, but this wedding has shown me that we don\u2019t have a relationship outside holidays at mom and dad\u2019s house, so let\u2019s just keep it real and I will see you there, being disappointed all the time isn\u2019t healthy for either of us\u201d.  \n\nThe problem is that Thanksgiving is upon us, and not only will they be at my parents\u2019 house but they are bringing a couple of friends with them, so I will be really outnumbered and uncomfortable.  \n\n**WIBTA if I opt out for this one year, stating it\u2019s too fresh of a wound for me and I\u2019ll see y\u2019all at Christmas?**", "created_utc": 1668798972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yys33k/wibta_if_i_opt_out_of_thanksgiving_with_my/", "score": 6092, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Brother didn\u2019t want you in the wedding party because you\u2019re not close.  He didn\u2019t make you your own special cookies at his wedding because his wedding doesn\u2019t revolve around making sure you have a dessert.\n\nThe letter to the newlyweds was pettiness overkill, but hopefully you mean it and you finally accept that you can\u2019t force a close relationship just because you want it.", "Why do grown adults insist upon acting like children? ESH. He should have told you.  And don't act like you're being all mature saying you \"set a boundary.\" You made a sulking ultimatum because your brother didn't give you the fancy gold tie at the wedding.", "Nah\n\nYou don't need to go.\n\nBut your brother did nothing wrong. You do not need to put siblings in the wedding party just because. Je had the desserts je wanted for his wedding. Your allergies are bad for you but don't effect wedding deserts", "Eh, I say do what makes you comfortable, but I'm also a little surprised, not by the hurt, but by the level of it.\n\nI can see your being hurt and I definitely think your brother could have taken you into consideration more, but by your own account you aren't that close. Not in age or in experiences. You didn't grow up together, you don't have a very close bond, so I'm a little confused about why your quite this upset about it. I kind of agree on the wedding party, not really about you not being a part of it, but on them saying they weren't having one and then having one. That feels like an AH move. HOWEVER, I've definitely seen more than one wedding expand almost against all wills. They go from \"no wedding party, small ceremony, 20 ppl wedding breakfast\" to \"wedding party of a dozen, three flower girls, twin ring-dog-walkers wear the ring is on the doggie collar, 300 person ceremony and reception. In Maui.\" It happens. And sometimes one sibling is basically the wedding planner and another is just a guest. It happens. It doesn't necessarily mean your brother doesn't love you, it just might mean you're not close enough for him to know these things would matter to you at his wedding, so he doesn't/didn't think to keep you apprised of any changes. It's a shame he didn't make cookies for you, but again, if you're not close, that just may not have been a priority on his mind. Maybe he didn't think dessert was a big deal. Maybe there were candies or fruit that you can have and he figured you'd eat that if you wanted something sweet after dinner.\n\nI sympathize with your feelings, but I'm not sure sending the note and then bowing out of big family gatherings is going to help exactly. It certainly doesn't seem to have lessened your hurt or anger yet. It might help more to schedule a one-on-one outing with him and work your way around to explaining how/why you were hurt at the wedding and that you would appreciate being taken more into consideration in the future.", "Yta- I\u2019m sorry but you need to get a grip.\n I would understand if you and your brother were super close and he did this but you\u2019re not.\n\nYou guys don\u2019t have a close relationship.\n\nYou moved out of state during your brother\u2019s  formative years. He didn\u2019t grow up with you,plus there\u2019s an almost ten year age gap between you .  And again , you guys aren\u2019t close .\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you expected to be made part of the wedding party and get so upset about it that you threw a tantrum and sulked in the bathroom . \n\nAnd now another tantrum for Thanksgiving.  \n\n\u201c but they are bringing a couple of friends with them, so I will be really outnumbered and uncomfortable.\u201d   \n\nOutnumbered ? From what ? Are you going into battle??  Now your brother isn\u2019t allowed to bring friends because it hurts your feeling too so you\u2019re going to not go.

It's sad, but you can't force something that isn't there. \n\nWhere it really sucks is that he deliberately lied to you and misled you about the wedding. And telling you what color suit and tie to wear just for photos is weird.\n\nUntil you can accept he doesn't want the same kind of relationship with you as you'd like, then you need to do what you need to do.", "NAH, I think you just really over think things at times and try too hard with your brother.", "Very soft YTA.\n\nYou moved away when he was 12 and you were 20. You're not close and just because you  moved back doesn't mean that is going to change overnight.\n\nBeing close is a two way street and it seems that you aren't willing to put the time in either unless you get immediate reward for it (in terms of being asked to be in a very small wedding party for a family member you admit you aren't close with yet)", "ESH. Your brother lied but you admit you aren\u2019t that close.", "Yta", "Seems like it's a you problem. I'm not sure your brother is even aware there is a problem. \n\nYou want a closer relationship with your brother but it sounds like you expect him to make all the effort.

The effort", "YTA.\n\nI read the title and assumed he hadn\u2019t invited you. He didn\u2019t leave you out of the wedding. He just didn\u2019t make you a groomsman. You\u2019re going to decide to not see your parents for an important holiday, damaging your relationship with them, because a brother who you aren\u2019t close to invited you to his wedding but didn\u2019t give you a special role?\n\nIf you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s past the point of trying to make this an important relationship, why give it so much of your attention? Why give up thanksgiving with your parents because of him?", "ESH -  Your brother sucks for lying about not having a wedding party. IDK why he thought he would get away with that one.  You suck for thinking that magically a relationship is going to develop because you suddenly move closer.  \n\nFirst, just because you want a relationship, doesn\u2019t mean he does.  Second, in your email, which I have a problem with, you state your relationship is done except for holidays at your parents and now you\u2019re skipping out of holidays with your parents?  Sounds like your relationship with your brother has been constant for over a decade and now you\u2019re upset about it.   \n\nI wonder how much your brother looked up to you growing up and how much you ignored him.", "I'm struggling to see what the issue is here.  You already stated that you and your brother aren't really close, so the gold tie/blue tie... maybe not so surprising?  \"I envisioned us getting closer but it never really happened\" does sum that up.\n\nYou've both never been close so the gold tie/blue tie... you're not in the \"inner circle\" per se with a brother you've never really been close too.\n\nGranted, that can still hurt when you're family by blood, but if you don't really have a solid relationship it might not be that much of an issue...at least to your brother.\n\nWhether you turn up to thanksgiving or not is really up to you. You're not an AH either way.  If something like this has effected you then might be worth bringing it up with your brother... yet if you already admit that you're not that close then perhaps it's not as big an issue that it needs to be.", "YTA and I'd suggest therapy to deal with your issues. Yall aren't close, have never been close as adults or even as kids, lived away from the family and you expected to be in his small wedding party. Yeah he should have been upfront about it with you but man you have some major overreactions. Stay away from thanksgiving if you want but man get help.", "Going against the grain here with NTA. He lied about no wedding party. Why? If you two are not that close, you did not expect to be asked did you? Lots of people don't have their siblings in the wedding party but it's just strange to flat-out lie about it. Did he think you wouldn't notice? He told you a specific color suit to wear and that you would be given a tie for pictures. Again why? If you're not in the wedding party why does the color suit and tie you are wearing matter? \n\nAlso, he didn't make sure there was a dessert you could eat. I know \"it's his wedding day\" blah, blah but he wasn't making the cookies the day of and he could have made a couple for his brother. \n\nI think part of this is simply you were not a part of his life for awhile so a close, brotherly bond did not form or some siblings are fine with each other but not close. If going to Thanksgiving would upset you, then don't go. You do not have to put yourself in optional situations that will cause you distress. He has not  shown that he wants to a closer relationship. He LIED to you about his wedding. I'd skip Thanksgiving, try Christmas and just start making friends and having a life. You'll find your people.", "Christ in a cracker, what did I just read?! \n\nYou seem to have convinced yourself that moving to the same town as your brother entitles you to a close relationship with him. It does not. \n\n> this wedding has shown me that we don\u2019t have a relationship outside holidays at mom and dad\u2019s house\n\nYou already knew the type of relationship you and your brother have. You moved away when you were 20 and he was 12. He may not want a close relationship with you, and while that sucks, you have to respect that. \n\nYou had a temper tantrum because you weren\u2019t in a very small wedding party. Which are usually reserved for those we are closest with. That wouldn\u2019t be you. It sucks they lied, but that\u2019s the only thing your brother did wrong. \n\n> He didn\u2019t even make any for me\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, there is not one single person on this planet who is entitled to dessert. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t close, maybe he forgot about your allergy. He made the dessert for his wedding himself. Maybe he had a lot going on and totally forgot in his busyness. \n\nSurely your mom and dad knew about the cookies. They could have given you a heads up, so you might want to be upset with them as well. \n\nThe long and short of it is, it was your brother\u2019s wedding. You were included, just not as much as you believe you deserve for some reason. Nothing on that day was about you. \n\nYTA and from the sound of it, an exhausting one.", "NTA, their wedding isn\u2019t about you, but the number of lies/miscommunication to sideline you is wild. I feel like we\u2019re missing some other details about your relationship with your brother, but still going with not an AH. The letter to them after the wedding was an aggressive unnecessary move, tbh", "NTA, you don't have to go if you don't want to and you don't have to force yourself to have a good relationship with \"family\" who don't want to put the effort in. Maybe he just doesn't like you and it's a none personal thing, you've just grown up out of his life.", "YTA. Your brother wasn\u2019t obligated to have you in his wedding, period. He should have been straight with you about having groomsmen but he was likely afraid you\u2019d react badly, which you did. You \u201cestablished a boundary\u201d because you didn\u2019t get to be in his wedding? That\u2019s ridiculous, especially since you aren\u2019t close and didn\u2019t really grow up with him.", "I\u2019m sorry but yeah YTA. You admit that you\u2019ve not lived in the same state as your brother since he was 12, and now you\u2019ve moved back you expected to what be best man at his wedding. You be his best friend and want to hang all the time? He has his own life and own friends.", "NTA for not going but YTA for your behavior surrounding the wedding.  You locked yourself on the bathroom stall for an hour?!   \n\nSiblings do not equal auto best friends and it sounds like you moved back into town and expected him to center you in his life.  This isn\u2019t reasonable or particularly mature.", "It seems like you have hurt feelings which is fine but I think your actions are closing in on AH territory. You moved away when he was 12 and you aren't going to magically be close overnight. Wanting a close relationship with your brother isn't wrong it's just going to work. You're practically strangers at the moment. And you're acting like you've been alighted by a close friend. \n\nDoes your brother know you have allergies? Did you mention it to him any time between when he got engaged and the wedding?\n\n>I was told that there was no wedding party because his wife\u2019s family is too big for her to make a choice and she didn\u2019t want to leave people out. I was given instructions to get a gray suit and that I\u2019d be given a blue tie for pictures. \n\nNow this is odd. Did you expect to be a groomsman? Again you're not close and while some people would include siblings out of obligation many people only have people actually close to them in their wedding party. It's also possible that the wedding party planned changed but since you aren't close you weren't on the short list for groomsman.", "Yta he didn\u2019t need to include you in the wedding party. You are making their wedding about you and acting like a petulant child who didn\u2019t get his way so you throw a temper tantrum", "<<so let\u2019s just keep it real and I will see you there>>\n \nESH, you and your brother both suck here. \n\nYou said you were willing to see each other at family holidays, and now you're instead choosing to skip the event altogether, which punishes your parents and is frankly just childish.\n\nYour brother doesn't owe you a place in his wedding party. But he should have been honest about it.", "NAH.  You don't want to go,  don't go.  You were at the wedding,  just didn't have the role you expected, so I don't think brother is AH either.", "YTA. it sounds like their \"wedding party\" was just a few people who are very close to them. it's completely unreasonable for you to hold a grudge over this. learn to let the little things go.", "Nta. \nEven though you are not close with a sibling, you should at least include them in major events in life. That's what i believe. Op tried to form a relationship with him btw was treated like a complete stranger. Thats why op is hurt. And he has the right to be hurt. About the Allergy thing op's brother should have notice it. Siblings are related by blood even though they live far btw we do have memories with them.Everyone will give judgments based on their experience. If my brother acted this way i would be hurt. And about the thanksgiving day op if you want to see your parents you should go. You will be visiting your parents not your brother just act civil. No need to try to get to know them or want a apology. Just act they are invisible. You can take a friend if you want to. Or you can visit them other day. Don't give your brother so much attention op cz in the end they Won't care about your feelings", "NTA. Your feelings are real. You get to decide if it's too painful for you.\n\nBut.... it's not unusual for people to choose friends to be in their wedding party, especially if they aren't close (physically or geographically) to family members. I can't believe anyone was looking at you and thinking \"what a loser, his brother didn't ask him to be in the wedding party\". \n\nYes, you get to opt out if you really think it's too painful. But be aware that this will probably be seen as you trying to create drama. I doubt if the your brother or anyone else will think \"wow, I didn't realize how badly he was hurt, I was really terrible to him\". They'll just think you need to get over it. Which is what I think: I'm sorry this hurt you, but it will be better for you if you can try to let this go. Maybe you and your brother can be closer in the future, maybe not, but making an issue out of this isn't going to endear you to him.", "ESH, but a little heavier toward the YTA. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t owe you a place in the wedding.  You said yourself that you\u2019ve never been close. \n\nHowever, he\u2019s a little bit TA for lying about it instead of telling you the truth from the beginning so you would have time to process the hurt before the wedding.", "INFO. What was your brother's reaction to your letter? And what was your parents' reaction?\n\nWith current info, I'd say a soft ESH. You shouldn't expect to be a part of his wedding party, he shouldn't have lied. Yes, he and his bride could have made something you could eat, but he may not have been involved in the catering, and it honestly doesn't sound like you guys are close. You are not obligated to go to Thanksgiving, but this is something you should have considered a while ago. I'd suggest going, but having a ready made excuse. Think of them as cousins you are visiting, worthy of polite conversation, but not a lot of effort.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to hang out with people that lie to you.", "NTA - You would not be the AH for skipping Thanksgiving. However, your brother is only the AH in this situation because he lied about the wedding party. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong by only including the people he was close to in the wedding party.", "YTA. You were the adult when he was the child, and didn\u2019t make an effort to be close to him. You moved back recently and still weren\u2019t close. Of course he would want people he\u2019s close to in his wedding party, not a sibling with whom he has no relationship. I understand that you we hurt, but that\u2019s no reason to make drama or take it out on him. You want to declare that you\u2019re \u201cwounded?\u201d That\u2019s foolish. You wanted to be close but now you want to cut him off? It sounds like you\u2019ve never been willing to put in the work to have an actual relationship with your brother. And now you want to make it awkward for the rest of your family. This very much sounds like a case of you having a very fragile ego.", "YTA - the title made it sound like you weren\u2019t invited to the wedding at all but you just weren\u2019t in the bridal party? Y\u2019all aren\u2019t close, since he was 12 you have lived away from him, you weren\u2019t there for his big life milestones! It sounds like their bridal party was very small. You are making a mountain out of nothing!!", "YTA- It wasn't your big day, it was your brothers and its their choice of who they want in their wedding.  I wasn't in my brothers wedding, but his wife's family was and he was more active in mine (we literally only had a maid of honor and best man), sometimes you just have to let things go move on.  There is no reason to be embarrassed by it though,  that is confusing to me as to why you were", "YTA. And here\u2019s why:\n\nDid you express that you would like to use the opportunity of moving closer to your brother as a way to get closer? Was he aware that you were upset about the wedding situation outside of your passive aggressive letter? \n\nBy your own admission you said you weren\u2019t close\u2026.so it\u2019s odd you\u2019d be shocked you weren\u2019t chosen for the wedding party - however informal it may be. \n\nI get that having allergies at events sucks but the groom made the dessert for his own wedding\u2026. If this was your wedding, fair enough but the day isn\u2019t really about you. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if you are too hurt to attend Thanksgiving but I think you could use it as an opportunity to rekindle the relationship and start fresh.", "YTA. \n\nYou admitted that you\u2019re not close to your brother because you moved away when he was a kid. You don\u2019t have a close relationship now. He shouldn\u2019t have lied that there was no wedding party, but adding you to the party might have been what would have caused the issue with her having to choose from her family. Ultimately, you are not entitled to being in the wedding party just because you share parents. You\u2019re the only one with an issue here, and you\u2019re turning a non-conflict into an ordeal that includes missing out on family events where you could potentially become closer. That\u2019s on you. \n\nTherapy is a great place to process your hurt feelings.", "A little bit YTA. I understand your feelings are hurt but there is quite a large gap in your ages and being far away for so long means the two of you don't actually know each other all that well. It's very unrealistic of you to expect to have the kind of relationship with him that does in fact take years to develop, as soon as you return. Skipping Thanksgiving is not going to help develop that either. Spending time together is how that happens. You were at the wedding, in that respect you may be acting a bit melodramatic.", "NTA. Seems your brother lied to you about the big day and didn't have an ounce of remorse. If you're still trying to calm down from that and go it'll just turn your parents' house into a battleground. I don't think you'd want to subject your parents to outright aggression. Maybe visit sometime before or after Thanksgiving when your brother isn't there.", "NTA, do what makes you comfortable", "INFO: How did they respond to your letter?\n\nAs someone with ADHD who really struggles with RSD sometimes, you\u2019re not an AH for being upset but you might want to look into therapy or other ways to help when things feel really hurtful.\n\nIf you and your brother aren\u2019t close and they decided to keep the wedding party super small then it\u2019s not surprising he went with two close friends.  Idk if he purposely lied about it, but it\u2019s possible that they just changed their minds.  Planning a wedding is usually hectic and stressful.  It\u2019s supposed to be about the couple getting married, but there\u2019s often hundreds of outside opinions/expectations that you have to deal with too.  I highly doubt your brother was purposely slighting you.  It was his wedding, not yours, so of course he prioritized himself instead of you.  You can be hurt, but it\u2019s unreasonable for you to hold it against him.", "YTA, it sounds like you wanted the wedding about you and the attention of being the groom\u2019s brother? You\u2019re admittedly not close and were not around for at least a third of his life. It sounds like you had a major overreaction. A lot of people don\u2019t even care about desert at a wedding, but you expected special desert just for you. Weird thing to get upset about, when they probably spent lots of money, planning, and stress on organizing a wedding to be expected to cater to a brother who the groom didn\u2019t have a relationship with for years. And then while they should be living the newlywed life, you sent them a passive aggressive letter. You chose to move away. You don\u2019t get to have a brotherly relationship by declaring you want one. And if it is truly important to you, you\u2019re not going about it the right way to make it happen.", "You don't have to go. But your brother did  othing wrong. Just in case you weren't aware, it was his wedding day, he could have whoever he wanted up front with him, and he could serve whatever he wanted as dessert. You sound like a petulant child. Hiding  in the bathroom  was silly, no one would have thought anything of it that he chose two best friends as groomsmen. People need to stop expecting siblings to include them in their wedding party purely because they are siblings", "Soft YTA. By your own admission you're not close, don't see each other often, and there's an age gap so I assume you didn't overlap at home for very long. Should he have been upfront with you about the wedding party? Yes. But he was under no obligation to include you.", "ESH\n\nYour brother should have handled the wedding better with regards to the wedding party.  All he had to say was \"We're keeping it very small and not really doing a traditional wedding \"party\".  I'm only going to have my two best men, and she's only going to have her sister and husband as her matron/man of honor.\"  Why lie?  \n\nBut man, you took it WAY too personally for a day that is ultimately *not about you*.  Y'all are not close, never have been, but you're having a meltdown over not being in the wedding party?  Sibling or not, you should never expect to be in a wedding party of someone you're not close to.  I understand why his lie hurt, but hiding in a stall in the bathroom because you, a grown man, can't handle not being in the wedding party of a sibling you aren't close to? Come on.  And you are ONE GUEST.  They aren't going to make a special dessert just for you.  It's dessert.  It's not essential.  You were not harmed by not having dessert for one night.

It was understandably probably quite low on their priority list.  \n\nAnd then the letter.  You ever think the reason your brother isn't super interested in a deeper relationship with you is because you handle problems like a middle schooler instead of having a conversation about it like an adult?  I don't have time for adults who write me petty letters either.  Invite me over for coffee and talk to me like an adult, call me on the phone, whatever is possible, but give me a chance to talk it out and give my side.    \n\nLook, your brother isn't obligated to give you the relationship you want with him.  This is the relationship he is interested in having.  You need to come to terms with that and move forward, one way or another.  And you need to do it in an adult manner, so stop with the middle school meltdowns every time other people don't give you what you want from them.

We saw each other on occasion, and loved each other, but that relationship of siblings was permanently broken by distance (this was before smartphones etc).\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten a little bit closer with many modes of communication at our disposal, but I would never expect that he would ask me to be a part of his wedding party. \n\nI\u2019m going to assume most of this hurt is coming from a feeling of being lied to, which is why your brother sucks too, he should of sucked it up and just told you\u2014\n\n\u2014 but for you to have this expectation to be in his party when you made it clear you\u2019re basically pen pals is unrealistic.

I don't think you say current ages or how long you lived elsewhere, but it's at least 6 years if he got married. \n\nSo...a third or better of his life you weren't around. Now that you've decided you want to be close, he's not interested. It happens. \n\nYou seem to regret this. Again, it happens. \n\nYall are siblings, not friends. He shouldn't have lied about not having a wedding party, you shouldn't have sent him a letter that reads as an attempted guilt trip, but meh. \n\nDoes seem like there may be some relevant backstory missing, but I don't think it'd really change my opinion. Yall are siblings, not friends, and from what's presented nothing screams AH, just uninterested (him) and vaguely hurt because of it (you).\n\nEdit: oh, I forgot to specify why the NAH re: Thanksgiving- so long as you aren't pouty or make drama for your parents, going to a family event is your choice. I'd personally suggest you just go and get it over with if this is really all the 'problem' with it tho. Otherwise you may find it's still fresh come Christmas, and the summer holidays you may as well spend with friends anyway, they aren't really 'family' days, and man... this is awkward, we're back at Thanksgiving again and everyone is going to think I've spent the past year sulking.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thanksgiving is coming and it's too soon after the conflict for me to be comfortable around him. WIBTA for opting out this year, or offering to celebrate with just my parents on another day?\n\nMy brother and I are 8 years apart, I\u2019m older.  Since he was about 12 I have lived in another state.  We aren\u2019t close, but we hang out a few times a year and it\u2019s easy and fun.  I recently moved to the same city as he and my parents.  I envisioned us getting closer but it never really happened.  He\u2019s the king of \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow\u201d with zero follow-up.  It hurts my feelings, but I\u2019ve accepted it and take what I can get.    \n\nHe got married this past September.  I was told that there was no wedding party because his wife\u2019s family is too big for her to make a choice and she didn\u2019t want to leave people out.  I was given instructions to get a gray suit and that I\u2019d be given a blue tie for pictures. \n\nThe day of the wedding I was hanging out in the mens\u2019 dressing room and I saw that my brother has a gold tie.  And that his best friend has a gold tie.  And that his old bandmate has a gold tie.  Odd, but I didn\u2019t think too much of it.  \n\nThe ceremony started and I was sitting in the audience.  Lo and behold, the music starts and there\u2019s a procession.  My brother\u2019s two gold-tie friends walk in and line up on stage left, and his wife\u2019s sister and her husband walk in and line up on stage right.  The nonexistent wedding party.  At this point I have an almost out-of-body experience.  The ceremony was a blur.  After the ceremony we \u201ctook pictures\u201d which means I took one picture with my brother and that was it.  I spent the cocktail hour in a stall in the bathroom, embarrassed and hurt.  \n\nI made it through dinner ok, and instead of cake my brother had made a ton of his specialty cookies for dessert.  I\u2019m allergic to the recipe as-is, but with a simple tweak I can have them.  He didn\u2019t make any for me, or even warn me this was happening so I could bring my own dessert.  Anyways, I left the second dancing started.  And a week later sent the newlyweds a letter saying basically \u201cI thought things would improve once I moved here, but this wedding has shown me that we don\u2019t have a relationship outside holidays at mom and dad\u2019s house, so let\u2019s just keep it real and I will see you there, being disappointed all the time isn\u2019t healthy for either of us\u201d.  \n\nThe problem is that Thanksgiving is upon us, and not only will they be at my parents\u2019 house but they are bringing a couple of friends with them, so I will be really outnumbered and uncomfortable.  \n\n**WIBTA if I opt out for this one year, stating it\u2019s too fresh of a wound for me and I\u2019ll see y\u2019all at Christmas?**\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Their wedding isn't about you.\n\nIf they started doing what you said, like not putting dairy on two of these cookies, then other people are going to expect that they accommodate their dietary restrictions for some dishes and then it becomes a logistical nightmare to deal with, not to mention the additional costs from the caterer.", "200 cookies, so I assume it\u2019s a big wedding.  He probably has bigger things to think about other than if you want a cookie, get over yourself, sounds like your brother won\u2019t even notice if you show up to thanksgiving", "Is the cream in a topping?  If so, that's a reasonable request.\n\nBut if this is an ingredient in the dough, then what you're actually asking for is for him to make you a special BATCH.  That's more likely 12 ish cookies, and since when people make cookies in bulk they generally prep the dough all at once and then just bake, you're also asking him to double his prep time and space needs.  Not only that, you can't just remove an ingredient from a recipe without ruining it.  He would need to *sub* something in place of that cream, and substitutions are trickier than you think.  It's very understandable why a person baking 200 cookies for their own wedding wouldn't have the time, space, or inclination to accommodate a single guest's dietary restrictions. When you don't have a commercial kitchen, a bulk bake is challenging enough and a special batch may just be outside your capabilities. Plus if you don't have a ready substitution for a particular ingredient, you'll probably need a bake or two to get the substitution right.  That's a lot.  And for something like dessert, which not everyone eats anyway, I wouldn't say they're really required to.", "Yeah maybe that would be better but probably figured if told in advance there would have been a massive hissy fit all the way to the wedding", "I don\u2019t think he read this at all.

It\u2019s clear you care about and want to be closer to your immediate family, and that thinks haven\u2019t shaken out as you expected them to. But I think at the wedding you chose to take things personally that were not slights against you.\n\nYour brother\u2019s wedding wasn\u2019t about you or his relationship with you. I thought your story was going to be that other siblings (like you and your brother\u2019s other siblings) were in the wedding party and you weren\u2019t given a heads up. They each had just two attendants, and your brother picked two people he clearly is socially closer to than your relationship. That\u2019s\u2026 not a crime. And it\u2019s not a slight. You were in the dressing room; that means you\u2019re close to the groom. Not being in the wedding when the wedding party is that small is not a surprise.\n\nThem not having a separate dessert to accommodate you is just something that sometimes happens at weddings. If they chose a different dessert that you weren\u2019t allergic to, but wasn\u2019t something you liked, it wouldn\u2019t be a slight against you. If they were serving peanut butter cookies and you whipped out a slice of cherry pie because you can\u2019t handle not having dessert, that would have been weird (and in my view, immature). It\u2019s not the same as not honoring food allergies at dinner. You\u2019re a grown up, and they were just cookies.\n\nI would almost say Y T A for that dramatic response afterward, but that\u2019s not the question at hand.\n\nIf you want to be closer to your brother, you should go to Thanksgiving. That\u2019s how you can start building a relationship. Rejecting him out of hand because your feelings were hurt will not bring you closer together.", "I'm sorry if this is hard to accept, but \"I wouldn't treat him that way,\" is not actually a valid standard to hold other people to.

This is an issue with distance and familiarity. I have a similar issue with my brother, who, despite all the effort I've placed through the years, we'll never be close, and I've learned not to take anything he says or does personally. \n\nBecause of the distance, living in another state, and the age difference, it's natural for you not to be at the front of his mind. On top of that, planning a wedding involves a lot of stress and hard work, so not thinking about your dietary restrictions comes as no surprise. I was so busy worrying about the details of my wedding that I forgot my dad was allergic to coconut and almost sent him to the emergency room on the day of the wedding. The point is, that it's easy to miss the most obvious details when planning a wedding. \n\nThat being said, *your brother should never have lied to you about the wedding party or talked to you about the decision beforehand to avoid the shock on the day off.* I feel your pain and see your wish to have a better relationship with him, but the way I see it, the ball is in his court now. You've made an effort and communicated your disappointment with him, so the best you can do is give him as much space as possible and live your life, trying not to let his attitude and neglect get to you. I know it's much easier said than done, but trust me, once you've embraced that sharing DNA does not make him \"family,\" you can set aside the negative feelings and be free from needing validation from him. Also, being cordial during family events, no longer reaching out, and being detached emotionally from him, will send him a strong message to either make an effort or never have a relationship. Showing indifference is the loudest action you can take without causing drama or making the issue worse. \n\n*Regarding thanksgiving, you should go despite the possibility of being uncomfortable.* Don't let this issue, which may be minor to him, grow and fester into a larger problem that may accidentally drag your parents or other family members into it. By not going, you are now involving more people, forcing your folks to take sides or alter future events, and the rift will become obvious to everyone. \n\nYou don't want your family or anyone else getting in the middle and accusing you of being the hostile one. Go to the dinner. *Bring a SO, friend, friendly cousin, or coworker to the dinner to avoid drama or conversation about the topic and act like there is no problem;* smile, be polite but keep your answers short don't ask him anything about his life, and treat him the way you would treat a coworker. Leave early and with a smile. Send a nice message after the dinner to everyone you saw there but not to your brother and his wife. This will send a message which will make you feel better about the situation but will remove any blame from you. \n\nIf you don't go, you are taking a large and very public action that may miscommunicate your intent and paint your pain as immature and petty. Also, it will establish a precedent and cause more of a rift. The more paranoid part of me also thinks that there is a chance that the situation might be discussed during dinner, with only your brother's side being shared. Your actions will be remembered by everyone, and you want to come out having taken the higher road and with no regrets or the possibility of idle gossip. **You made an effort, showed up, and no one can say anything negative about your actions.** By showing up, you avoid the possibility of negative backlash, and who knows? Maybe things will start getting better from that point on. However, if you don't go, you only leave yourself open to making things worse between you two.  \n\nJust my two cents. \n\n**TLDR:**  NAH - but by not going, you make yourself look bad to your family and create an uncomfortable situation for everyone. **Go to the dinner,** avoid drama, and take a friend or a couple of friends to act as buffers, make you feel more comfortable, and act cordial to your brother.", "After thinking about it, I\u2019m going to say YTA here.  I acknowledge that your brother being dishonest rather than straight up telling you he had chosen his friends to be in his wedding party was hurtful.  But your overreaction to not being in his wedding party kind of justifies why he chose to lie, from my perspective.  \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the lie that really bothers you.  I suspect your real hurt comes from the fact that he didn\u2019t include you in his wedding. But, since you acknowledged that your relationship with him isn\u2019t close, it shouldn\u2019t have been terribly surprising that he had two people he felt closer to than you.  Being his brother doesn\u2019t entitle you to special wedding party consideration.  (Especially since you were largely absent for an extended period of time of his life.) So you being blindsided to the point of hiding in the bathroom and bailing early is pretty over the top for what you should have only considered a slight because of his dishonesty.  His wedding isn\u2019t about his relationship with you, but I think you wanted it to be, and that\u2019s why you were so hurt by being excluded.  Also why the cookie thing even sticks in your mind.  Not only was it unnecessary for him to go to the trouble of making a special batch of cookies just because you are allergic\u2026on a day that is already stressful for him\u2026it is ENTIRELY unnecessary to tell you in advance so you can \u201dbring your own dessert.\u201d  (who even does that?

It hurt to feel so excluded on the day itself.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long road processing that someone I love and care so much for is so indifferent towards me. I think setting up boundaries and not participating in situations that will make you uncomfortable is fine to do. But you should ask yourself who you\u2019re actually punishing. Will you be missing your family on thanksgiving? Not to be harsh, but if the intention is to make him realize he\u2019s a bad brother or to feel remorse, it likely won\u2019t happen.

Plus, they're 8 years apart and were never close, so why is OP expecting to be in the wedding party?\n\nMy brother and I are 10 years apart (I'm the youngest.) I was not in his wedding and he wasn't in mine. Nobody got upset. We weren't especially close growing up but have become much closer as we age. Our parents have passed on. So it's just us. We are closer now than ever. When my husband died my brother and his wife have been there for me every step of the way even though we're 1,500miles apart. We made sure we were in touch over the years.  I see no evidence that OP has done much to reach out and kindle a relationship. Grow up, OP, and go to Thanksgiving with your family.

Whatever you had in your mind for his wedding just didn\u2019t happen. I would be upset about the lies about not having a wedding party but come on man. You guys are just brothers that don\u2019t talk. Most families have them but you are taking away from being with your parents.

Sorry and I hope you work out your issues with your family.", "My brother is 8 years younger than I am. He ended up in my husband's wedding party because we lived with my parents for some time before getting married. My husband's sister, who had moved for school before we met, did a reading at our wedding but wasn't in the party. I was not in my brother's wedding, nor in my SIL's. Nobody pitched a whiny \"I'm so hurt\" fest about whether they were included or to what extent. \nHonestly, your behavior is childish and petulant. I'd be curious to know how much effort YOU put into being closer with your brother? Because you make it sound like you expect him to put in all the work here, and cater to you, when you admittedly haven't really been part of his most formative years. \nI call YTA for your excuses, but honestly, if you're going to just be a toddler about the situation, yeah, skip the family event so you don't bring it down for others.", "I think when you moved away, your brother created a whole life for himself. He loves you but cannot count on you to not leave. Not that it was wrong for you to leave but at a young age, those things can affect our psyche. It also depends on how as the older one, you handled being gone. Did you check on him with regular I love you\u2019s and want you in my life kind of check in. Or did you go, do your think, and then came back expecting some kind of reconnection? Those things affect your relationship now. Introspect, if you didn\u2019t do all the things needed to keep that relationship going when he was 12, you are basically a stranger with the same genes at this point and need to start all over again to build a relationship but at his pace, not your pace because again, he built a life for himself with you gone not counting on you ever coming back. Your expectations were too high coming back, like you would pick up where you left off when he was 12. It doesn\u2019t work that way. The whole weeding things was petty as hell, you expected way too much too soon. Start slow, go to the thanksgiving get together, build those relationships, don\u2019t expect to have his undivided attention but spend time with your parents and your brother without expecting too much. Enjoy time with family without being the center of attention. And go to therapy to help you process your sense of loss from your years away.", "YTA", "Yta. Im sorry.

Brother or not, you even admitted you weren't close. Now you are trying to be petty and put your parents in a position they don't deserve to be put into. The adult thing to do would be to accept that you weren't part of the wedding party, apologize for coming across as a child, and then let him know that you wish to build on your relationship.

It's customary, but it isn't a requirement. And honestly, it doesn't sound like they had an elaborate wedding. You were in the family photo. Sure, it sucks to realize that the person you share the most DNA with isn't super interested in you, but you sort of missed your chance. Over a day that was still pretty hectic, about his growing family (usually brothers don't have much of a part to play in the sibling's relationship), and then sent a nastygram that it wasn't about you.

My advice is to not attend an event you don't want to be at, and maybe after the holidays reach out to your brother for a beer/coffee/whatever and say that you want to be closer, but you get the sense that he's ok with how the relationship is now. That you're willing to respect that but you just wanted to share how you feel in case he wanted to grow the relationship.\n\nBe prepared, he's indicated with his behavior that he may not want a different type of relationship with you, and you may just have to accept that. \n\nGood luck.", "NAH, I guess.

With that said I would also go to Thanksgiving and tell your brother that you love him and are always there for him but don\u2019t pressure him towards action, tell him how to live his life or request a deeper relationship. Sometimes the best way to ensure others will connect with you is to provide them the freedom to explore and be there if he ever needs you. It will take time.

He is significantly older than his sibling, left home when sibling was young, and admittedly doesnt have a close relationship with them. The fact that he felt \"humiliated\" at not being a groomsman, hid in a bathroom, left early, and then sent a passive aggressive text is just so extra and self centered. I guarantee not a single other person had a thought about OP not being in the wedding party, so what is there to be humiliated at? Nothing. The issue is all in his head, and he is basically cutting off his nose to spite his face by not going to Thanksgiving.

Sending him a letter is honestly a great way to burn the bridge between you and your brother and never make sure you never have a relationship with he and his wife or your future nieces and nephews. It\u2019s also a good way to alienate your parents, since they now can\u2019t see both sons on the same day at the same time through no fault of their own.", "So was he supposed to look sad and dazed in front of everyone?

Weddings change at the last minute without warning so maybe they weren't originally having a wedding party, but that changed. As for the cookies, that expectation is ridiculous.

You could\u2019ve just pulled your brother aside and talked to him about it at thanksgiving or something instead of making a huge deal about it. I understand sometimes family can be hurtful, but I don\u2019t think anyone intentionally meant to hurt you. It sounds like you need to speak to your brother before thanksgiving so you and your family can have a nice, peaceful holiday together. \n\nOh and being mad about the cookie thing is a bit extreme and reaching. Wedding planning is stressful and frustrating. Your brother probably didn\u2019t even think about you being allergic. I love my older sister, but every holiday I forget she\u2019s severely lactose intolerant and forget to make a dessert that she can also enjoy.

And besides that you happened to move back to the area, how have you tried to build a relationship with your brother? Isn't that on you as the big brother?\n\nIt's disappointing that he didn't outright tell you the truth, but I suspect this is because your brother is used to tiptoeing around your hurt feelings.\n\nBetter that you don't go to the family Thanksgiving, though, rather than go and make everyone else miserable.

You seem so exhaustaing with that victim mentality- \"I will be really outnumbered\" like are you expecting a confrontation during dinner?\n\nYou admit you're not close- why were you embarrased you weren't in the wedding party? That's pretty normal esp if he told his closest friends that he's not close to his brother it would be awkward to now have him in the wedding.

He probably doesn't care. \n\nThe only part I hear is the desert part but even then most functions I've been to (weddings, balls, baby showers etc.) most people skip the desert portion especially at weddings bc the cake cutting is so late and most people dip out by then.

But you saying this was \"conflict\" and it's \"too soon\" to see him is really detrimental to no one else except for yourself.  \n\nI strongly recommend speaking to a therapist about the way you handle relationships, anxiety, communication, conflict, and how you push the management of your feelings out onto other people. Having an \"out of body experience\" because of *this* and letting it ruin your relationship with other family members is incredibly extreme. You need to speak to a professional.", "Yta lol.

You don't have a relationship with your brother. \n\nMaybe it's a generation gap thing, but it's quite common to politely reject an acquaintance by giving non committal response.

You need to seriously consider that your brother may be hurt because you cared more about your status/role than his big day and genuinely being happy for him.

I definitely have maternal feelings towards my younger siblings.  As younger siblings get older, everyone really needs to put in that effort to keep the relationship close.  When it\u2019s one sided, it can be very painful, so I understand why OP feels the way he does, but he definitely went a little too scorched earth on his brother.", "I think there is some history that OP is not sharing or he has strong and contrasting political, religious, or lifestyle views to his brother. Outside of the overreaction by OP, there seems to be some reason that the brother doesn\u2019t want a closer relationship. The brother being personable at family gathering means he is an adult capable of being civil, not that he is somehow playing with OPs emotions or giving him mixed signals.", "Well said. The brother shouldn\u2019t have lied, but aside from that, this seems like a massive overreaction. OP and his brother aren\u2019t close, and the brother doesn\u2019t seem interested in being closer at this point in his life. That\u2019s his right. OP is sabotaging any chance at building a friendly relationship with his brother by being overly demanding and sulky. The brother probably dreads being anywhere near his brother due to the judgey vibes he\u2019s throwing out.\n\nOP has a choice. Show up for Thanksgiving, be friendly and accept the relationship for what it is, or stay away and accept responsibility for his part in the broken relationship.

As much as I would like to hang out with her more we both have our own lives and are 2 different people and we understand that. After you are forced to be around the same people for 20 years the people you chose become a priority over family. That's just pretty normal. You see family during holidays and such and that's enough for the most part. The fact that you're asking to hang out enough that hes actually able to blow you off seems strange to me... i think what you call a personality shift is just him no longer forcing it to spare your feelings anymore. \n\nI think you made him feel obligated and dispite what you said here i think you sent him that message secretly hoping he would feel bad and change instead of agree with it... and if that's the case that's not healthy", "I don\u2019t think he doesn\u2019t care but you guys are very far apart in age and you lived away for a very long time.

He doesn\u2019t miss it because he never had it. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault you were in vastly different life stages but it seems to be a little short sighted and unfair expectations on your part that proximity would naturally close the emotional distance. \n\nIt\u2019s fair to feel hurt but also he didnt do anything wrong.

It\u2019s an extremely tough age gap to find things to bond over, like you, I was graduating high school right when my sister was starting school. I developed friendships that feel like a brotherhood with friends that know my life a lot more than my sister does.\n\nI feel the only spot your brother really screwed up on was the suit and not just being honest as he should have just told you that you\u2019re not part of the bridal party. My question to you is, do you think you\u2019re a bigger part of his life than his best friend and band mate just because you share parents? They would be just as hurt as you are except they\u2019ve been engaged in his personal life while you were gone. \n\nAs for his personality, you go through drastic changes in life that don\u2019t happen over night but are a culmination of your life. Like you said, you\u2019ve been gone for a long time and to you these changes seem drastic, your parents are also probably hurting due to him prioritizing his wife and the family he\u2019s going to build over you and your parents, like a good husband should. The cookie thing could very well be an accident, unless you reminded him about this allergy while he was making the cookies or there\u2019s the chance that someone at the wedding grabbed the one without frosting. This point your making here is going to be one you regret down the road. Way too many variables to jump to be did it on purpose while baking deserts for an entire wedding. \n\nAt the end of the day, remember Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day and if you keep pushing him he can just walk away from you altogether in an instant. It sucks, You\u2019re NTA but you need to change your perspective on quite a lot in the situation.", "Nah, not esh. The wedding is not the question. The question is whether OP would be the A for not going to thanksgiving based on this melodramatic backstory in which they *specifically mentioned* still going to holidays. \n\nThe behavior at the wedding was ESH, the *letter* was already YTA at that point, now OP just continues to double down.", "As someone that had to arrange big events this likely is not a \u201cstraight up lie\u201d rather details moving very quickly and changing and a mere oversight involving someone clearly not close tot the couple", "Maybe Bro lied to him because he knew OP was the kind of person that wouldn't take a hint and the type of person to have a meltdown when someone doesn't reciprocate their feelings and make them special cookies.

I was simply a guest at her wedding and helped with things before and after the ceremony. The party members were her best friends since childhood. No one blinked. Because that's normal. You bring the people you're CLOSEST with to stand beside you when you make your vows. Your brother did nothing wrong. You've made zero effort and now you want him to do all the work and also remember an allergic reaction you had when he was a little kid? That's preposterous.", "And he suck\u2019s a little for lying.

The brother probably wanted to avoid that!", "OK, so he lied so as to avoid OP confronting and bullying them about it. \n\nOP is still an asshole. How is OP humiliated? Did the officiant announce to the audience that OP was not in the wedding party because they weren't close? OK, so how the fuck is he \"humiliated\" beyond OP's own self-entitled expectations?

Lo and behold after almost two hours of no response I watched them walk out of the place we were supposed to be meeting. Then they had the audacity to lie to my face when I confronted them as if I didn\u2019t catch them red handed. I felt so used and hurt and it has caused permanent damage between me and my siblings. \n\nOPs brother could have just told him that they were keeping the wedding party very small and there wasn\u2019t room for anyone else.

He might have remembered about your allergy, sure. But how would he be able to ensure that no one else eat them? Does he have to arrange to store and monitor them somewhere? Instead make a whole other cream-free batch of a coupke dozen to ensure you get some even if others take also? This increases not only his costs, but also takes but so much *logistical brainspace*.\n\nThese are not things a groom should be concerned with on his wedding day.

If you were able to have the rest of your meal safely, I think you're okay.", "I am actually not quite sure if the brother lied. The initial point was that there would be no wedding party because the bride's family is too big to choice just a few people from. Eventually the wedding party was incredibly small, with just two close friends of brother and the sister and brother in law of the bride. I can imagine that was decided as a compromise after brother told OP there would be no wedding party. We're also given no time frame about that.", "OP - you\u2019re the older person here. Stop trying to make your little brothers life all about you. Show an interest in him and make your interest unconditional. That\u2019s what mature people do.

I will hold off on judgment for now tho, I need more info.\n\nI will give OP this, if my semi-estranged siblings had a food-allergy and I'd invited them to my wedding, I'd make it a priority to have at least one dessert option for them too.

Letters have both formality and familiarity.

I think people really don\u2019t understand.\n\nAs someone who is the little sibling in this dynamic (down to the older sibling being really sensitive), it\u2019s really annoying to hear people who don\u2019t understand.\n\nMy sister left home when I was 12 and before that she was a teen with her own life so while we did hang out before she left, the age gap meant that dynamic was different than siblings who grow up closer in age. I was an afterthought. She got really close to her husband\u2019s family and sisters which was fine, but again, she used those years to bond elsewhere.\n\nShe would lament when I became a teen and  a young adult about how we drifted apart, when I was simply doing the exact same thing she did to me: doing my own thing in my teen and young adult years. She didn\u2019t solidify the bond when she had the chance so I didn\u2019t see her as someone I had to keep in my regular social plans.\n\nShe went off during the formative years of when siblings form tight bonds. So that ship sailed. I just don\u2019t feel very connected to her and we\u2019ve always been different on top of that. \n\nI actually have nothing against her, and love her, but we just don\u2019t have a ton in common and don\u2019t talk much. I found it really rich that suddenly I was the bad guy for a while because when I was finally cool enough to hang out with, suddenly I had to rearrange things to make it work. \n\nYou don\u2019t just get to swoop back in someone\u2019s life when you left and then come back in and expect a relationship just because you\u2019re ready for one. Younger bro just probably doesn\u2019t feel bonded to older sibling. They probably feel more like a distant relative and not someone they had to constantly inform of updates. It seems like OP isn\u2019t accepting this and I understand it hurts, but ultimately they left. It feels like they are trying to guilt younger sibling into a relationship and admittedly the younger sib could be more direct; but there\u2019s a lot of societal pressure to not reject family so you often feel like the bad guy for not really wanting to pursue a close relationship with a sibling.", "This is what gets me. \n\nOP: I am so hurt and offended that you lied to me, I will retaliate by no longer trying to force you into a closer relationship than you want. See you at holiday dinners!\n\nBro: \u2014\n\nOP: oh no, a holiday dinner! How ever can I survive it in the same room as him?!\n\nDoes OP not get that only seeing each other at holidays is exactly what bro is looking for in a sibling, and this entire drama is playing out inside his own head?", "Agreed. I too left the state when my youngest brother was 12 and wasn\u2019t a part of his wedding party 15 years later. My other siblings, who hadn\u2019t moved away, were. We didn\u2019t have a conversation about it; I would like to have been included at some small level but really, nbd. I\u2019m not a part of his daily life the way the rest of the family is. It didn\u2019t destroy our relationship. \n\nOP wishes he and his brother were closer. Maybe bro doesn\u2019t feel the same. In any case he can only be responsible for his own actions and reactions; skipping family holidays is unlikely to bring them closer. NAH except for that sus bit about there being no wedding party (and it is possible that at the time of the conversation there wasn\u2019t).", "I\u2019m sorry but there is a vast difference between not telling someone that they aren\u2019t in the wedding party and looking them in the eyes and flat out lying to their face about there not even being a wedding party in the first place. IMO the first is a dick move anyway if the person is someone who traditionally is usually in the wp but the second is just cruel and even downright malicious. Also the cookie thing is a smaller issue admittedly but this IS his own brother and if one tiny tweak even just to a small batch really would\u2019ve been all it took to make them safe for him esp as it sounds like they were the only desert on offer/the equivalent to the literal wedding cake then it should\u2019ve been at least offered as an option that he could\u2019ve then refused out of politeness. I agree there must be missing reasons but I doubt they\u2019d play out in the brothers favour at this point.", "Also why would OP feel they should be in a wedding party that says he was never really close with?", "He does not know if others were in on the lie though. Also, they compounded the lie with the tie. Why on earth would they go to the trouble to get him a blue tie and tell him others would match?", "Also in his message, why did the brother say \"being disappointed all the time isn't healthy for either of us?\" It sounds like the brother also wanted to strengthen their relationship when he moved to the same city as OP, but for some reason it didn't happen. What is it that makes the brother disappointed in OP, and why does OP feel that he will be \"out numbered\" at Thanksgiving? It definitely sounds like we are not getting the full story here....", "It's all very Me Me Me!!", "I've been in a couple weddings where the size of the wedding party jumped around.  First it was no wedding party- then hey, can you be MOH, and there is a best man and that is it.  Suddenly there were three more people in the party and we need to coordinate dresses - oh but A dropped out so we are bringing in B.  I'm sure most of their family had no idea all that was going on after the initial 'no wedding party' statement.", "It\u2019s so weird- based on his own description of their relationship - it seems crazy that he would assume he would be in the wedding party. I was in a wedding once for a friend who had 2 older sisters that she was close with and she didn\u2019t put either of them in her wedding party and it wasn\u2019t a thing at all.", "Do you have siblings?  This man has one who he has tried to become closer to, it seems for no apparent reason the brother that married does not, he  should  least tell him he does not care they are related.  If my siblings treated me like this I would be hurt.   And my oldest brother was twenty five years older than I.   I was very lucky that we all loved each other.", "I feel like I'm eating crazy cookies over here. Is it not completely normal to ask/provide an allergy appropriate alternatives for your guests? Like if your aunt can't eat the cake, you have a different slice for her or a cupcake or something. Same with having a dessert for the brother. People online seriously think any common courtesy is entitlement these days. \ud83d\ude44", "Completely agree. OP sounds pretty selfish. OP, may want to ask how much you're willing to take responsibility in this relationship you were hoping for. It'll take more effort on your part. Skipping Thanksgiving is a good way to keep you from creating that relationship. Getting to know your brother's friends will get to know him a little better and give a foothole in his circle. Getting to know your SIL is wonderful to show your brother you want to be part of his life. Expecting to be catered to and having a pity party at his wedding was on you. I agree no knowing about the wedding party hurts. However, plans can change in the course of planning a wedding and since you guys aren't close he wouldn't think to inform you since you wouldn't be in it anyway. It was on a need to know basis I'm guessing. OP you may need to get over yourself on this one.", "I mean, even if he didn\u2019t remember about the allergy, it\u2019s fairly popular to ask if anyone has any allergies so no one dies at your wedding from an allergy.", "It's also pretty common to ask for dietary restrictions in the RSVP. I'm sure there were more than a few people there with restrictions, and if they catered the wedding without asking that wasn't great.", "So then the top commenter should go 'INFO' at OP rather than just making stuff up to fit their judgment. They don't really have the basis to say that OP's brother 'did nothing wrong', imo.", "The wife wasnt mentioned as being cocerned about a behavior change either so brain tumor seems like a huge reach.

It's the inclusion of that detail.\n\nA wedding party - other than the maid/matron of honor and best man/woman - is largely ornamental anyway.

And we didn't tell others that had asked to attend that they could attend because it didn't even dawn on us while we were busy ironing out the last minute details.

The last minute excitement lead to the few extra invites. \n\nWe didn't lie to people when we originally told them they weren't invited because we weren't inviting people. Hell, my own siblings weren't invited and the only reason my husband's siblings ended up attending is because my MIL (wonder and non boundary stomping) misinterpreted \"Just our parents and our family\" and assumed that meant his two brothers since one BIL still lives at home so she told my other BIL who flew in for it.

It may even have been his wife who insisted on having her closest sister and BIL, so he needed 2 people close to him for his side. He had the right to have his wedding the way he and his wife wanted, and included you in the family picture.

I was not asked but also not expecting to be a part of the wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony and I'm glad to witness my brother marry the love of his life. Just because you weren't as much involved as you would like to be doesn't mean that you weren't a part of it. Who cares that you didn't stand next to him, you were there and we're supposed to celebrate their love. None of that day was meant for you or for y'all's relationship to become closer, it was purely meant for the bride and groom.

Not sure why you expected to be in the wedding party. What you described sounds more like each having two witnesses and not having a wedding party (which would include best man, ushers, etc.). Honestly I find your reaction a bit melodramatic. I don\u2019t think you would be the AH for not going to thanksgiving (up to you to spend it alone I guess), but you are acting like a child. You were never close to your brother. Why would you expect to be one of his witnesses.", "YTA, sorry. You said in your letter to them that your relationship is only good for holidays at mom and dad's, which Thanksgiving is, so you'll look even more petty if you don't show. The only reason it will be awkward at all is because you wrote the letter. Otherwise I think this could've been fine and you could've just swallowed your pride and said \"hey we aren't close, I'm partially to blame for fucking off in his teens, whatever\" and moved on. They had a super small wedding party and you weren't close enough to be included, sorry. And baking for one person with an allergen, especially with all the other things going on around a wedding, is a lot to ask. \n\nHonestly you sound like you have a bit of a victim complex and you've made the most important day of their lives all about how they slighted you. You might want to look inward on that.", "YTA. You literally had an \"out of body experience\" and cried in a bathroom stall at a wedding because you weren't invited to the party and because your brother that you aren't close to didn't make cookies specifically for you? Good grief you need counseling. You have some serious unresolved issues going on.", "Yta", "YTA\n\nI know you feel hurt by not being more important to the party. And yeah, it does suck your brother didn't remember your allergy. \n\nBut besides that, you kinda just sound entitled. You weren't \"left out of the wedding\" like the title says; you were invited, you got to experience it with everyone else, and while your brother forgot, it sounds like it was just for dessert. And why would you bother sending a letter a WEEK after their wedding- usually when newlyweds are happiest- basically guilting them for it? I think going to Thanksgiving would be a good way to actually maturely have a conversation about it with your brother. It is not a \"fresh wound\" and it doesn't sound traumatic except that you were overdramatic and not included into the wedding party. You two aren't close, as you've said, and you should just feel happy your brother got married.\n\nAlso, but the title, it sounds like you're blaming his wife as well? You literally did not mention anything about her as a person besides 'her family is big'.", "YTA, though I don't think you're an asshole so much as that you have some issues you need to sort out with a therapist. And I don't think you'd be the asshole for not going to Thanksgiving so much as making a big thing out of it as you historically seem to do. If you just said \"I can't make it to Thanksgiving this year, sorry!\" that would be fine, but if you in any way make it about something you feel your brother has done, YTA.\n\nI never understand this thing with some people, where they get upset at other people for not feeling close to them. Stuff like \"they didn't even think to do this for me\" \"they didn't even check on me after x\" \"they didn't even remember my birthday\" \u2014 okay? Why is it their fault that you're not a high priority in their life? Because you think you \"should\" be? You're allowed to be hurt by it, but YTA for making it his problem when really it's yours.\n\nIt's not \"enforcing boundaries\" if the other person isn't really trying to enter your boundaries and you're just upset that they exist in your life in a way other than how you want them to exist. It makes total sense for you to take the hint and decide to stop trying to force closeness where it doesn't exist.

Tell me this, did you go to great lengths to stay in touch with him during the time where you moved away from him? If the answer is no then he probably felt abandoned and hurt by you. I don\u2019t think YTA for opting out of Thanksgiving, I think YTA for making it a huge deal and guilt tripping your brother for not being close with you.

The lying is strange, however based on your off expectations I\u2019m suspecting you were hounding them and they didn\u2019t know what to tell you.  Or they said they weren\u2019t having much of a wedding party and you took it as you wanted.   Just like you took the cookies as a personal jab.

But again, you admit that you\u2019ve essentially been out of his day-to-day life since he was 12. Is it that surprising that he has built his own life without you? Building the brotherly relationship you seem to want takes both time and mutual commitment. It doesn\u2019t seem like he wants this as much as you are thrusting it upon him and getting disappointed that you don\u2019t suddenly take priority in his life. \n\nHave you had any conversations about expectations or what you both want from this relationship? Maybe he\u2019s uncomfortable with the expectations you\u2019ve exerted on him. \n\nPlanning a wedding is super chaotic and stressful and you were definitely not the most critical thing on his mind in the process.

I'm one of those people.  I can love someone dearly and just kind of suck at doing the phone communication thing.  Personally, I think you should go to Thanksgiving.  Move past the other things and realize that they likely aren't personal and you can absolutely choose to not take them that way.

Also you assumed he lied to you about not having a bridal party when its just as possible that the plans just changed. You made your brother's wedding about yourself and your needs instead of just being happy for him. \n\nAlso your letter to him was so petty and passive aggressive.

It's a couple of cookies, why are you having such a tantrum? Were they supposed to accommodate every single dietary restriction for every guest? This day is supposed to be about them, not you.\n\nAnd if you're so upset over desserts, maybe there's a reason they left you out of the wedding party. They shouldn't have lied, but maybe think about the ways you interact with this brother and the expectations you set for him. Do you give back in the same vein as you take? They could have decided it's not worth the drama to include you.", "dude, have you sat down and actually talked about any of this with him? you just sent him that note and let it be? i feel like you really can\u2019t expect more from your brother here unless you talk to him about wanting to be closer.", "To be honest OP, it doesn\u2019t seem like you and your brother have an equal relationship.

I'd like to hear the brothers side before making claims on who's right.\n\nAnyway, OP you're not TA for wanting to skip thanksgiving but you are an AH for how you handled someone else's wedding. Taking it as a personal attack on you and your allergies. I really hope you stick to what you said in your letter and stop forcing a relationship. Otherwise, it comes off as petty and guilt trippy when, honestly, it was clear he just doesn't feel close to you (probably due to the age gap and you not having much of a relationship for years after moving states to begin with). Things happen out of our control that we just have to accept, even if it hurts.\n\n\nETA - the fact that they think he has a brain tumor is a bit extreme. Adults in relationships \"pull away\" as they forge their own lives and create a family. The way op is acting coupled with their tumor theory makes me think it's more the brother is probably putting up boundaries and they don't like it. Notice how only his family is concerned and no mention of his wife being concerned as well? I mean, OP admitted to hardly knowing him but now all of a sudden he knows him enough to see a drastic change? A drastic change from when he knew him AT 12 but then barely had a relationship? Riiiiight", "That could have been true when he said it, and when the wife settled on a sister and BIL, bro had to find two people. Giving OP a place would have meant that then Bro had to choose 1 of 2 band mates, when he is demonstrably closer to both of them rather than OP. Having just 2 people on each side was a perfectly reasonable choice for them to make, and OP is not entitled to stand up with bro to the exclusion of other, closer chosen family, simply because they share parents. \n\nOP didn\u2019t see him often for at least a decade or so - nor take the lead with a 12 year old kid once he moved away - and just expected to be invited into Bro\u2019s inner circle the moment he returned home.

It\u2019s not like weddings are stressful or anything. It\u2019s fucking cookies. Go home and eat dessert if it\u2019s that big of a deal. And if these special cookies were baked just for OP was his brother supposed to stand there and make sure the correct person was given the special cookies? Omg People. Grow up.", "Weddings are a stressful, busy, and chaotic time. I bet the brother didn't even think/realize that he should make some \"special cookies\" for his brother to enjoy. It's also incredibly self-centered to expect someone to do this. Why would he need a heads up - again, likely not even on the brother's mind - about cookies?

You don\u2019t have to be particularly close to your sibling to treat them with some common courtesy and respect. OP has every right to be upset. He was lied to about wedding parties and probably felt humiliated when the bride\u2019s sibling was up there, while he sat in the audience. Had his brother explained ahead of time that he wanted a small wedding party that only included his two best friends, it still might\u2019ve hurt his feelings, but at least he was shown enough respect to not be lied to. \n\nIt seems that their was no malice or animosity build-up through their relationship growing up, just not particularly close. I can understand how OP could see this as unwarranted and hurtful. \n\nNTA-Op, you still need time to heal. And that\u2019s okay.

My future SIL is gluten free due to celiac, and while we are absolutely accommodating her for the main meal (just like the brother did with OP), the desserts are not gluten free.

I hope my MIL will be able to bring something, but she'll have a lot on her plate the day of too, so I gave my future SIL a heads up.  \n\nShe was very understanding, laughed, and said she certainly wouldn't be harmed if she skipped dessert for one night so don't worry about it.

I\u2019m working through that, and in the meantime I\u2019ve been working on setting boundaries and distancing myself because 1) being around my family brings up all these negative feelings and 2) the reasons for those feelings are perfectly understandable and it isn\u2019t healthy to continue to be in that environment. My family just sees it as I\u2019ve changed too much. One of my friends is experiencing the exact same thing with her family-mom, dad, and sister all think she\u2019s changed completely when she\u2019s just disengaging from a toxic environment.

People who lie don't usually do it with the knowledge that they will 100% be caught doing so.\n\nAs for never letting him know there in fact WOULD be a wedding party, this doesn't strike me as odd or wrong either, because of how distant they are.

You were the older sibling and should have made more of an effort if you wanted a closer relationship. You seriously sent a letter because your feelings were hurt? That's cringy and if this had been a girl you were friends with people would be calling you a nice guy.

Part of growing up is specifically learning that people have all kinds of reasons -- some good, some crazy, some incredibly vain -- for choosing their wedding party.

Just wish the couple well, smile for the camera, eat what you're able, leave as soon as you politely can, and avoid making it about you. You don't have to like it.
