In June my partner and I took our kids on a 2-week vacation, so in advance I contacted my ex and asked him to take the dogs. He agreed but then 3 weeks before the trip said he couldn't take them because he would be in a different city for work. I told him he needed to figure out someone to watch the dogs then. He told me that they were my dogs, and it was my business to sort that out but that he would pay for a kennel. I didn't want the dogs to go to a kennel because they never have before, and the rescue has a lot of anxiety already. I asked if he knew someone that could take the dogs and he said no. After some back and forth, against my wishes I found a good kennel for the dogs to stay at for the first 5 days of the trip before my ex picked them up. \n\nWhile I was away the kennel sent me updates on the dogs.

He finally picked them up on the Friday, 3 days before we got back. \n\nSince last June, he has asked me to take the dogs a few times and each time I have told him no.

He came to my house unannounced last Saturday wanting to take them hiking with him and I told him no and we got into an argument, and I told him I'm not going to let him see the dogs again until the next time I need him to watch them.

So you're saying it's okay for her to go on weeks long pleasure trip, knowing her dogs are in a kennel, but he shouldn't have gone to work? Is the vacation more important than work, or....?", "Should he be at her beck and call whenever she needs a dog sitter, and drop work if she needs him to? Is that not trying to control him?", "No because he doesn't need to see the dogs \ud83d\ude44 literally that's the question.  This was the situation, she decided he no longer needed to see the dogs since he doesn't see them as his responsibility, therefore he doesn't get to show up and demand them. The end", "Now you're completely disingenuous. They had that planned weeks, maybe months, before", "Yeah, unless she needs him to,didn't she say that? So not his dogs, but she considers him their sitter when she needs him. Goooot it \ud83d\udc4dmaybe go debate with some of the other ppl who gave the \"yta\" judgment, explaining the obvious is getting tiresome.", "Absolutely YTA. Your ex is not the problem here it\u2019s you. \nYou coparent with this man and you want the relationship to be strained over dogs. Especially when he didn\u2019t do anything wrong and gave you plenty of warning about what he could and cannot do. Yeah you\u2019re in the wrong with this one. And I feel bad for your son, because You\u2019re choosing to make an issue out of something small. You\u2019re ex sounds like a reasonable guy and you sound like a unreasonable person. I\u2019m not surprised the marriage didn\u2019t work out. I just hope your current partner takes notes on how you\u2019re acting so he doesn\u2019t get himself stuck in the same situation.", "YTA. If you had a regular babysitter cancel, would you make it their responsibility to find childcare? I don't understand why you think he should have prioritized your vacation over his job. He still took the dogs for half of it!", "He didn\u2019t gladly take them when he got back, he left them in the kennel longer than he had to because he decided they were fine even though OP told him the rescue was stressed and anxious (and yes, kennels can cause dogs stress and anxiety.  It\u2019s a strange place full of strange dogs and strange people.)", "No, it was the ex's responsibility to find a sitter for the dogs once he backed out of watching them himself. The ex initially agreed to take the dogs for two weeks. Why is it OP's responsibility to have to scramble to find care for them when the ex realized he couldn't? Is it OP's responsibility to find a sitter for their child if the ex wants to go out on one of the weekends when he has custody of the son?", "Apparently you didn't read the part about the ex agreeing to take the dogs for the two weeks, then backing out three weeks before the vacation. Apparently you didn't read the part where they have an agreement that while they are her dogs, he can take the dogs hiking with him when he wants and take them for weekends when he has custody of their child if he wants to.\n\nWhat did you read?", "Him not picking them up after he returned from his trip and only taking them for 3 days instead of the 14 days is what make him an asshole in my eyes. \n\nIf his lifestyle doesn't allow him to care for dogs fulltime, he should not have made promises he can't keep. He broke an agreement three times, I would see him as unreliable too. \n\nMaybe he is petty now, but you know - actions have consequences...", "Or she's using the dogs to mess with him. You don't think it's strange that OP cares so much that he can't see the dogs, yet says he can't see them, until the next time she needs him to watch them.", "if you hire a babysitter for your kids, and the babysitter cancels for whatever reason, is that babysitter required to find their own replacement?", "He offered to pay for the kennel?", "He was the care plan though. \n\nHe agreed to take them potentially. He agreed to take them for 2 weeks. Then he agreed to take them after 5 days comming back from the work trip. Then he took them 3 days instead of the original 2 weeks.\n\nHow is he not an unreliable asshole?", "I agree that OP is being petty and not fostering a good co-parenting relationship, but it's not insane for her to expect the ex to watch the dogs and/or pay for boarding if he can't watch them as that is their agreement and he has agreed to take the dogs for the two-week period.", "If the ex's only relationship to the dogs is that of a sitter, then OP has no obligation to let him take the dogs whenever he wants to. \n\nIf you hired a babysitter for your kids, and the babysitter had to cancel, would you then hand your kids over to the babysitter at a later date because the babysitter wanted to do stuff with your kids?", "That's why you go through a site where the sitters are verified & you can see reviews left by clients, and meet them beforehand to sus them out.", "I meet up with people I used on Rover twice before they pet sat. Great reviews, background checks, and constant updates", "I think it's really tough if you don't have a personal prior relationship with someone. We found someone who came highly recommended, who did really well during our meetups, and who was really good for the first 2 days, then suddenly we only got pics of the dog from the first 2 days for the rest of our 10 day vacation. come back and there's scars on his nose, likely from another dog, and the dogsitter refused to explain. he developed resource guarding shortly thereafter. no idea what she did but she traumatized my dog.", "we\u2019ve loved using rover! amazing people on there and my dog always has a blast. he actually gets mad when he comes home because he has all his buddies there LOL", "Three weeks is not adequate time to make alternate arrangements. Kennels get booked months in advance for summer vacation weeks. Same with boarders and sitters. \n\nIf it's so easy to make alternate arrangements, why didn't the ex do that since he was the one breaking his promise?", "If they're HER dogs, why does she have to let the ex see them?", "Exactly. How bonded is he when he only saw them occasionally and extended the kennel time after he got home.", "Yes, because that is their agreement. He can take the dogs when he wants to as long as he also takes the dogs when she needs him to. He didn't stick with the agreement.", "i hope you get the help you need."]}
