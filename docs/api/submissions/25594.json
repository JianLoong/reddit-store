The noises my MIL were hearing at night were *mice*. Even after the dragon was thrown away, she still swore up and down that there was a demon. She started complaining about banging noises at her door, which, our house is small and our bedroom is right down the hall from hers\u2014if there were banging noises, we\u2019d hear it. There was nothing.\n\n We finally sat down and talked with her and told her\u2014there\u2019s no demon, there was *never* a demon, you are hearing mice. She stopped complaining about demons after that. \n\nThen Christmas came around, and she tried saying that the Christmas tree we put up was blasphemous and something about how it was a man-made ritual and how Jesus saved us from needing to do that ritual\u2014despite the fact that she was there and watched us put the tree up and even told us stories behind Christmas ornaments she had made. I *really* can\u2019t make this up. She, really, just wanted the thing taken down, and that whole thing made my fianc\u00e9 realize that his mother just uses religion to exploit him to do what she wants and when he realized\u2014yeah, his mother\u2019s off her rocker. \n\nThe Christmas tree belonged to my grandmother, who passed away. He had my back on that one, and while we did take the tree down anyway (it was mid-January), we made it clear that it would be coming back up next year and we weren\u2019t going to tolerate this again.\n\nCommenters of the original post will be *devastated* to hear that my fianc\u00e9 and I got married in May of this year\u2014to be honest? Life has been wonderful. MIL hasn\u2019t tried anything like this again because she knows we won\u2019t tolerate it. And my husband is wonderful to me. He loves me, he dotes on me, and he\u2019s improving himself every single day, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of him. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t listen to the comments on this one that told me to break up with him.\n\nIt\u2019s not picturesque, we have had conflicts, of course, but we\u2019re able to resolve them. You know, because conflict is normal in relationships. Recently, there\u2019s been a few unfortunate situations in my side of the family that have been causing me a lot of stress, and he has been my absolute rock through that whole scenario. I\u2019m so proud of the man he\u2019s become the last year and continues to grow into every single day. My husband is also finally addressing the religious trauma\u2014he still has some growth on that one, but he doesn\u2019t buy everything his mother tells him anymore, and is, at least, taking the reigns on growing his own religious beliefs and opinions away from her.

Yeah, you sure showed us.\n\nRelationships may have conflict sometimes, but I can't even imagine my husband doing anything even in the same zip code as that lunacy.\n\nLol and from the original: \"I told him if he throws the dragon statue away, there will be issues, and he said, then there will be issues.\"\n\nNarrator: and there were not issues...", "yeah you're still TA to yourself but good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "Just wanted to note, banging noises might be the hot water heater having trouble, especially if it's older and/or your water is hard.

I'm sure he'll never completely breach her trust again!/s", "Reading her comment about how she has \"nowhere to go\" and I wonder if she's genuinely just trapped herself in an abusive marriage and has convinced herself that she's actually happy to cope with her shitty reality.\n\nI'm pretty sure that might be giving her too much credit, though.", "She already has, and somehow thinks it's a \"gotcha\" moment, apparently."]}
