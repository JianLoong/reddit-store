The noises my MIL were hearing at night were *mice*. Even after the dragon was thrown away, she still swore up and down that there was a demon. She started complaining about banging noises at her door, which, our house is small and our bedroom is right down the hall from hers\u2014if there were banging noises, we\u2019d hear it. There was nothing.\n\n We finally sat down and talked with her and told her\u2014there\u2019s no demon, there was *never* a demon, you are hearing mice. She stopped complaining about demons after that. \n\nThen Christmas came around, and she tried saying that the Christmas tree we put up was blasphemous and something about how it was a man-made ritual and how Jesus saved us from needing to do that ritual\u2014despite the fact that she was there and watched us put the tree up and even told us stories behind Christmas ornaments she had made. I *really* can\u2019t make this up. She, really, just wanted the thing taken down, and that whole thing made my fianc\u00e9 realize that his mother just uses religion to exploit him to do what she wants and when he realized\u2014yeah, his mother\u2019s off her rocker. \n\nThe Christmas tree belonged to my grandmother, who passed away. He had my back on that one, and while we did take the tree down anyway (it was mid-January), we made it clear that it would be coming back up next year and we weren\u2019t going to tolerate this again.\n\nCommenters of the original post will be *devastated* to hear that my fianc\u00e9 and I got married in May of this year\u2014to be honest? Life has been wonderful. MIL hasn\u2019t tried anything like this again because she knows we won\u2019t tolerate it. And my husband is wonderful to me. He loves me, he dotes on me, and he\u2019s improving himself every single day, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of him. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t listen to the comments on this one that told me to break up with him.\n\nIt\u2019s not picturesque, we have had conflicts, of course, but we\u2019re able to resolve them. You know, because conflict is normal in relationships. Recently, there\u2019s been a few unfortunate situations in my side of the family that have been causing me a lot of stress, and he has been my absolute rock through that whole scenario. I\u2019m so proud of the man he\u2019s become the last year and continues to grow into every single day. My husband is also finally addressing the religious trauma\u2014he still has some growth on that one, but he doesn\u2019t buy everything his mother tells him anymore, and is, at least, taking the reigns on growing his own religious beliefs and opinions away from her. I appreciate the helpful comments I received, and thank everyone for their feedback made in good faith.", "created_utc": 1693101331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162dg2k/update_aita_for_not_letting_my_fiance_throw_a/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Did you ever tell grandpa you threw his priceless records away because of your husband?", "I like how you just super casually threw in there that you threw the dragon away rather than directly leading with it...\n\nI do hope he has truly figured out how to stand up to his mom's manipulation and that you two continue to be happy.", "\"My husband is wonderful to me\"\n\nWhen he isn't throwing away your possessions and pretending that demons are real. Maybe next time she'll see something outside her window that means your husband needs to harm you.", "I can't believe you have been caving to her demands, letting your now husband enforce those demands, and now you want to act smug because you got married. Yeah, you sure showed us.\n\nRelationships may have conflict sometimes, but I can't even imagine my husband doing anything even in the same zip code as that lunacy.\n\nLol and from the original: \"I told him if he throws the dragon statue away, there will be issues, and he said, then there will be issues.\"\n\nNarrator: and there were not issues...", "yeah you're still TA to yourself but good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "Just wanted to note, banging noises might be the hot water heater having trouble, especially if it's older and/or your water is hard. It might be worth hanging out with it while it makes hot water at some point to see if it's noisy, and it might need to be serviced if it is.", "May all your delulu come trululu.", "Direct quote from OP's comments on her original post: \"I'm honestly just so broken. I have nowhere to go, and I have lost so much trust and respect for my fiance and mother in law.\"\n\nYou come on here and have the audacity to sneer at people from your high horse after you spent all that time writing your fianc\u00e9 as the villain. You wouldn't know how to handle conflict if it came with detailed instructions, because your now-husband probably threw them in the trash along with the rest of your sentimental items.\n\nMazal tov on your marriage, you deserve each other.", "This shit ain\u2019t over and I can\u2019t wait to laugh when  OP comes back to Reddit bitching.", "Well, I guess it's true that people can't be helped unless they *want* to be.\n\nBut hey, he dotes on you when he's not going behind your back! You clearly won here!", "Do you really want to entwine your life with these people?\n\nNTA but run!!!", "Plot twist: it isn\u2019t a demon, it is grandpa\u2019s ghost who is pissed off she sold his records", "Oh, OP didn't throw it away, her now-husband did behind her back.\n\nBut don't worry, she's still happy that she married him! I'm sure he'll never completely breach her trust again!/s", "Reading her comment about how she has \"nowhere to go\" and I wonder if she's genuinely just trapped herself in an abusive marriage and has convinced herself that she's actually happy to cope with her shitty reality.\n\nI'm pretty sure that might be giving her too much credit, though.", "She already has, and somehow thinks it's a \"gotcha\" moment, apparently.", "You really thought it was going to be some flex coming back here and telling us that you stayed with a man that violated your boundaries, put his mother first, and is the reason YOU threw away your grandfathers precious collection. \n\nLike, are you actually trying to be smug that you guys did what the MIL wanted and THEN told her she can\u2019t always get her way? \n\nCongratulations, the delusion runs deep in this family.", "erm", "It was always only your items that had demons in them. Your grandmother's Christmas tree. Your Grandfather's records. The statue you brought for your mother.

I didn't. We've worked through it.\n\nNot handling conflict? Bitch, you literally don't know anything about me besides two fucking reddit posts from a very narrow chapter in my life.", "Reading her previous post, she didn't. She refused the opportunity to house them because of MIL and Grandpa got rid of them because no one could store them for him. Whatever reason OP had for.not taking them does not make her responsible for what Grandpa did with them.", "Holy fucking shit, yall are TA.\n\nOne, I DID NOT THROW THE VINYLS AWAY. They were in a storage unit. I told Grandpa I wanted to get them but didn't have the room to put them in our car by the time we found them. He said I was welcome to have them. I DID tell him I wasn't able to go back.  He understood. My grandpa doesn't care about the vinyls, it was more sentimental value on my part.\n\nFuck you, and fuck the rest of you.", "Right? MIL's going to go full crazytown when they have kids, I guarantee it. Like, trying to baptize them behind their backs, shit like that.", "Really, the only thing I'm still bitching about is my MIL's stick up her ass about me watching horror movies, and dealing with the trauma she's inflicted on my husband because of it.", "That's a good point. Ever since this happened and she tried pulling this stunt, she's never complained about banging noises. I think she was making that shit up, to be honest. I think this house was built in the 60s or 70s? It's possible, I guess.", "Oh, he saw it. It's just that he didn't have any attachments to most of the stuff. Once it did affect him, well that just couldn't stand.", "Already married, good job on not reading the whole post.\n\nAs far as faking witchcraft, I'm getting a tattoo, I literally own all the Dragon Age games, books, I have Harry Potter everything in my room, I watch horror movies--pretty sure that counts as witchcraft in her book. She flipped out when she saw the Dragon Age books because it has the word \"Dragon\" in them. I explained to her *why* it's called Dragon Age, and I told her that it doesn't have dragons in it (which is mostly a lie, she was freaking out about \"The Stolen Throne\", which actually doesn't have a dragon in it. Unless you count Flemeth's brief appearance.)", "Grandpa's still alive and kicking. :D We're actually meeting up to have lunch with him tomorrow. I didn't sell his records, I just didn't take them from his storage unit and told him before the end of his lease there so he could take care of it. HE was the one who decided to let them go.", "Yeah, fuck all of us for having cared about you and not wanting you in a situation where Oedipus and his mommy could do whatever they liked with your things up until it affected him, at which point he miraculously saw the light. \n\nFuck all of us indeed. It's clear now that you really do deserve each other.\n\nMay your next marriage go better.", "That is not how you worded that. I see from your edits he had to \"choose to let them go\". So, they're still gone.", "OH, no. I've made it loud and clear that baptizing our kids without them wanting it is completely out of the question, divorce territory, and his mother isn't mentally able to care for herself, she's never gonna be with our children unsupervised. We both agreed on that.\n\nWe also made the decision to not have children until I graduate and we move out of here, so that's fun. I also have endometriosis, so right now I physically cannot have children. I'm purposefully not getting the treatment to remove the endometriosis until we're ready for kids. I have medication to deal with the side effects in the meantime.", "You let them throw away the dragon statue that was going to be a lovely gift. Even after you tried to stand up for yourself, they did it and you let it happen, teaching them that your boundaries meant nothing. \n\nMorrigan will remember that.", "Mmmm, no. Caring about someone isn't telling them that they deserve to be treated like that if they're gonna let it happen. Caring about someone isn't calling them fucking stupid over it. Caring about someone isn't telling them they're at fault for a vinyl collection that had more sentimental value to myself than their grandpa not coming home with them when they make it clear what actually happened.\n\nAnd, LITERALLY, I've only made two posts on this reddit account. Ever. You really can't judge the fullness of a situation based on two posts about a very narrow part in someone's life. You don't know everything about me, my husband, or anything. My husband has some mommy issues--he knows this, and he's working on that part. He has religious trauma. He's addressing that. I *also* have some trauma from this, and I've definitely grown a backbone on this issue and have made it clear that I will not tolerate being treated like that again, and I won't hesitate to divorce and leave if it happens again."]}
