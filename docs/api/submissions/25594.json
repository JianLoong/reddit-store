The noises my MIL were hearing at night were *mice*. Even after the dragon was thrown away, she still swore up and down that there was a demon. She started complaining about banging noises at her door, which, our house is small and our bedroom is right down the hall from hers\u2014if there were banging noises, we\u2019d hear it. There was nothing.\n\n We finally sat down and talked with her and told her\u2014there\u2019s no demon, there was *never* a demon, you are hearing mice. She stopped complaining about demons after that. \n\nThen Christmas came around, and she tried saying that the Christmas tree we put up was blasphemous and something about how it was a man-made ritual and how Jesus saved us from needing to do that ritual\u2014despite the fact that she was there and watched us put the tree up and even told us stories behind Christmas ornaments she had made. I *really* can\u2019t make this up. She, really, just wanted the thing taken down, and that whole thing made my fianc\u00e9 realize that his mother just uses religion to exploit him to do what she wants and when he realized\u2014yeah, his mother\u2019s off her rocker. \n\nThe Christmas tree belonged to my grandmother, who passed away. He had my back on that one, and while we did take the tree down anyway (it was mid-January), we made it clear that it would be coming back up next year and we weren\u2019t going to tolerate this again.\n\nCommenters of the original post will be *devastated* to hear that my fianc\u00e9 and I got married in May of this year\u2014to be honest? Life has been wonderful. MIL hasn\u2019t tried anything like this again because she knows we won\u2019t tolerate it. And my husband is wonderful to me. He loves me, he dotes on me, and he\u2019s improving himself every single day, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of him. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t listen to the comments on this one that told me to break up with him.\n\nIt\u2019s not picturesque, we have had conflicts, of course, but we\u2019re able to resolve them. You know, because conflict is normal in relationships. Recently, there\u2019s been a few unfortunate situations in my side of the family that have been causing me a lot of stress, and he has been my absolute rock through that whole scenario. I\u2019m so proud of the man he\u2019s become the last year and continues to grow into every single day. My husband is also finally addressing the religious trauma\u2014he still has some growth on that one, but he doesn\u2019t buy everything his mother tells him anymore, and is, at least, taking the reigns on growing his own religious beliefs and opinions away from her. I appreciate the helpful comments I received, and thank everyone for their feedback made in good faith.", "created_utc": 1693101331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162dg2k/update_aita_for_not_letting_my_fiance_throw_a/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Did you ever tell grandpa you threw his priceless records away because of your husband?", "I like how you just super casually threw in there that you threw the dragon away rather than directly leading with it...\n\nI do hope he has truly figured out how to stand up to his mom's manipulation and that you two continue to be happy.", "\"My husband is wonderful to me\"\n\nWhen he isn't throwing away your possessions and pretending that demons are real.

They were in a storage unit. I told Grandpa I wanted to get them but didn't have the room to put them in our car by the time we found them. He said I was welcome to have them. I DID tell him I wasn't able to go back.  He understood. My grandpa doesn't care about the vinyls, it was more sentimental value on my part.\n\nFuck you, and fuck the rest of you.", "Right?

She flipped out when she saw the Dragon Age books because it has the word \"Dragon\" in them. I explained to her *why* it's called Dragon Age, and I told her that it doesn't have dragons in it (which is mostly a lie, she was freaking out about \"The Stolen Throne\", which actually doesn't have a dragon in it.

I've made it loud and clear that baptizing our kids without them wanting it is completely out of the question, divorce territory, and his mother isn't mentally able to care for herself, she's never gonna be with our children unsupervised. We both agreed on that.\n\nWe also made the decision to not have children until I graduate and we move out of here, so that's fun. I also have endometriosis, so right now I physically cannot have children. I'm purposefully not getting the treatment to remove the endometriosis until we're ready for kids. I have medication to deal with the side effects in the meantime.", "You let them throw away the dragon statue that was going to be a lovely gift.

Ever. You really can't judge the fullness of a situation based on two posts about a very narrow part in someone's life. You don't know everything about me, my husband, or anything. My husband has some mommy issues--he knows this, and he's working on that part. He has religious trauma. He's addressing that. I *also* have some trauma from this, and I've definitely grown a backbone on this issue and have made it clear that I will not tolerate being treated like that again, and I won't hesitate to divorce and leave if it happens again.", "> \u201cnot handling conflict?

Because that's what I got from it. My bad if I misunderstood.\n\nWhich, her husband was a wifebeater, so--yeah, she might be off her rocker, but she's not like *that.*", "See, you say that you've made it loud and clear... but you also said there would be issues if he threw away the dragon... but there apparently weren't.  You appear stuck with needing to convince husband that his mom is wrong because it goes his way no matter what- he agrees with mom, the drain goes; he agrees with you, the tree \"stays\" (we'll see what next year brings) so who's to say what happens once kids are actually here? Will he side with you or her?", "Yeah, soooo, about that--\n\nNever mentioned it, because I felt it was irrelevant at the time and I was still trying to appease my mother--she's a narc. As in, textbook what you would find on raisedbynarcissists. I've known that for a while, honestly, I had a therapist point this out to me a few years before I met my husband. She told me to look up narcissistic mothers and that's how I found *that* sub. We had gotten into a fight because she was upset that I had been with my then-fiance for two years at that point and *still* wasn't pregnant and I told her I wasn't planning on having kids anytime soon, and I'm still not. She guilt-tripped me, I felt bad, so I bought her that dragon to try and reconcile *and* as a birthday gift.\n\nI have since gone NC with my mother--she tried to sabotage the wedding by saying loud enough that \"why is she wearing white? She's not a virgin\" for my in-laws to hear, knowing they're extremely religious, hoping it would cause trouble. Joke's on her, though, since most of them had had children before they were married, so... Which, she doesn't actually care about that sort of thing. She was pregnant with me when she married my father, and she had given birth to my youngest sister three weeks before she married my stepdad.\n\nI don't anticipate anyone believing me, and saying \"oh, how convenient, must be your husband forcing you into it\"--uhhh, no. Not at all, actually. But whatever.", "If you really believed that we were all wrong, that you've got your happily ever after, that your husband was just a poor bwaybwee and his mom was the problem all along, and that it's all okay because you like Harry Potter and Dragon age, you wouldn't be lashing out at everyone for being disappointed in you. You'd shrug it off and be unresponsive (before being that way because someone enforced forum rules; if it hasn't happened already, it probably will soon).\n\nThe fact is, we aren't judging you half as much as you're judging yourself, deep down. You know perfectly well that marriage isn't going to make him suddenly care about your boundaries. \n\nSo when he inevitably tramples on them again, either for mommy or for himself, have a care with who you cry to online. Because everyone here pointing out your esoteric happy ending would be there for you, but you are treating us like your husband treated you on mommy's behalf, and we don't deserve that.\n\nReligious trauma is real and it sucks. I'm truly sorry you and your husband have it. But where was this defensive fire you're showing for him, when you needed to be defended? Trauma doesn't mean you take no responsibility for what you do and say. Trauma doesn't mean you get a free pass to treat your wife like that. And trauma doesn't mean *you* get to shit on everyone here for having an attitude when the reason we *have* that attitude is because *your very own narrative* paints a picture of an unhappy future. \n\nYeah, we're being unpleasant. We're being unpleasant because we wanted better for you. You've shown us a window into your life and we aren't able to reach through that window to help arrange things in your life to be more emotionally safe for you. You are more than words on a screen, you're a person, and we can see a pothole we feel you're about to frolic into, but you insist there's fresh paving on the road ahead. It's upsetting. We're reacting. \n\nIs it our place to feel any kind of way about you or your life? No. But we do. So maybe try and take it the way it's meant. \n\nI hope you're right and things get better, but as we can only go on what you've told us, that's what we're going on.\n\nETA: I want to stress that I'm NOT saying don't cry online if things go south. When you need an emotionally supportive army, Reddit is great about having a thousand determined, faceless entities at your back, ready to guard you from the world. If you look, you'll see that happening all the time, even if there's been squabbling with the person. **You will never have to face trauma and abuse truly alone again,** and I want you to remember that. Shit, my own dms are always open to anyone who wants an ear, and you have to know I care even if you take potshots at me because I've written you a novel here. When I say be careful who you cry to, all I mean is that we aren't bowling pins to set up and throw balls at.", ">Just to be clear, are you hoping she'll tell him to harm me? Because that's what I got from it. My bad if I misunderstood.\n\n\n\nThis is so crazy all I can say is, you all deserve each other.", "\"Religious trauma is real and it sucks. I'm truly sorry you and your husband have it. But where was this defensive fire you're showing for him when you needed to be defended?\"\n\nWhen the Christmas tree incident happened, he *did* have that defensive fire. It was a complete 180 from the dragon incident. We talked about it afterwards, and I brought that up--\"why didn't you do that with the dragon?\" He didn't have the answer then, and I still don't know if he does now. I think me pointing out to him that he wasn't necessarily showing me if I could trust him during the whole dragon thing really shook him and he took that seriously.\n\n Plus, there was an incident a few months before the dragon incident that I didn't mention because I had forgotten it where he had a panic attack because my sister and I watched \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" when she visited, and his mother had him convinced that witches cast spells on horror movies and demons get in the house through horror movies, so he has a visceral reaction to any horror movies involving supernatural entities. I only watch movies like that when he's at work, and with headphones on so my mother in law doesn't freak out on me. I had to sit down with him, have him explain it to me, explained it back to him, and he realized how stupid that sounded. He first thought he was getting it wrong, but then we asked his mother about it and she COMPLETELY believes it, said it as confidently as if I were to say the sky is blue. I think that put that seed that his mother isn't exactly sane then, but he *still* has panic attacks over horror movies because of her. His progress is *slow,* but we live in a conservative hellhole where the mental healthcare industry in this state is absolute trash and he doesn't really have any actual options for therapy to address it.\n\nI *really and truly do* believe he can make so much progress once we move out of the house--which is rented, and is in *all* of our names. Legally, I have as much a right to be here as my MIL and husband. She can't throw us out--but we need to move anyway for *his* sake. We can't exactly afford that now. I'm *hoping* we will in the next year or so.\n\nPeople were 100% right in pointing out to me that the situation was wrong, and how he treated me was wrong. I appreciate *that.* They did NOT have the right, nor were they in the right, to treat me and talk to me the way they did. I have learned to match energy with people and to stand up for myself when people are being aggressive, but insisting that I'm somehow deserving of this because we resolved this, moved on, and got married, they're completely right about the situation and there's no alternative to it is not right. I *do* stand up for myself now whenever there's religious bullshittery going on, but it doesn't happen often, and I use that same energy. Life is good. People don't try to exploit me, or take advantage of me, and Husband knows that he needs to get his act together, and he is making progress. Yet people *still* insisting that he's an abuser is just so frustrating. They DON'T KNOW HIM. They know one thing about him that isn't very nice. It's not his entire person."]}
