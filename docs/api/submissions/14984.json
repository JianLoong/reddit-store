Why the hell is someone in his condition allowed to give out prescriptions?

Don't just leave negative feedback; that will just be ignored. Contact customer service @ the website and file a complaint. \n\nThe issue is nothing to do with the employee being mentally disabled.

If he was an able-bodied/minded individual, she wouldn\u2019t feel as guilty inputting a negative review. However, a disabled person might have an underlying reason that caused impatience, misunderstanding, etc\u2026 so the negative interaction isn\u2019t necessarily a personality issue as much as a medical one. So, criticism of that seems more harsh than just criticizing an asshole. \n\nI see where OP is coming from. She\u2019s still NTA though. Reasonable accommodation indicates an employee needs to be able to meet the core functions of a position with or without reasonable accommodation. If an employee\u2019s disability cannot be accommodated in order to meet the core function of a position, they do not need to be employed. If this employees disability precludes them from being polite to customers in a customer service position, they shouldn\u2019t be in that position. \n\nFor example if a person can\u2019t work in a paint store due to fumes, the company has an obligation to attempt to provide them with reasonable accommodation, i.e. a filtration mask or similar device. If this reasonable accommodation still doesn\u2019t work, the employee can be let go legally, despite it being a medical disability. Same reason someone in a wheelchair can\u2019t sue for not being hired for a landscaping job.", "NTA. Disabled or not, there are positions that people are good at and others they are not.", "NTA. He should not have been put in that situation once you already explained that there was a problem with the order. His colleagues should have handled it so they\u2019re the AH. \n\nThey need to know because customer service is an integral part to profitability. \n\nThey asked for feedback. You gave them that.", "Absolutely NTA. He shouldn't be working there, medication mistakes can literally kill someone, and his behavior was completely unacceptable.", "You are not an asshole for going in and correcting your order. You are now sneaking into asshole territory by saying he's incompetent and should be removed from his job. He managed to resolve it all; you got your correct product; and even people without speech disorders or handicaps make mistakes sometimes.\n\nThink very long and hard on whether he was actually being \"aggressive\" and antagonistic, or if he was just loud and you were uncomfortable because he's handicapped.\n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nHe still has to be able to provide the service.", "NTA he was WAY out of line and Clearly Not able to do the job.", "NTA you should get what you pay for.", "NTA. OP said nothing about the disability, just a communication barrier. They treated the employee with respect and didn\u2019t get upset about it.", "I think it's against the rules, as this is against a business not a individual.\n\nAnyway NTA, the store has do make sure he is capable of doing the job he is placed in.", "NTA..you didn't get the right product plus he got aggressive. Disabled or not that's not okay, and if that is a problem that that particular employee has, then either the business or the employees help staff (providing said employee has one) needs assign him a helper for stressful situations.", "NTA\n\nI'm all in favour of offering employment to disabled people (I have long-term health issues myself). But the job must be one that they are able to do despite their disabilities. Your complaint isn't against the staff member with a disability, but with a company that isn't providing the product you paid for.\n\nIf he can't tell the difference between the 0.5 oz product and the 1.6 oz product, he either needs retraining, re-assignment to a new role, or letting go.", "I think you should report him to the store manager that's inappropriate \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI have no idea why your sister is such a bully about this. It\u2019s not like a mistake she made once then apologized for; she does it time and time again and, apparently, gets more aggressive every time. \n\nI feel for you, though! Both my siblings have names that are in the Top 10 Most Popular Named for the year of their birth, while I am the only person in the USA with my name the year I was born\u2026 I get lightheartedly teased about it by them occasionally, but on a few occasions that someone at our school bullied me over it, both of them would stick up for me (and my name!)\n\nNot to mention, Wren isn\u2019t exactly an unheard of name. I actually know 2 Wrens irl. It\u2019s both a name *and* a word that most people have heard of before, not a name everyone needs help sounding out or one that everyone would pause just seeing written down.\n\nSeriously, I have no idea what your sister\u2019s problem is, but she is ***definitely*** TA here! \nIf you *want* to be a (petty) asshole, point out that it\u2019s clear that your parents actually put some thought into **your** name, they didn\u2019t just pick something off a Most Common list!", "NTA.

(Don't steal)", "In the nicest way possible, are you dumb?", "In the nicest way possible, are you? Everyone is told don't steal from a young age. There is no room for misinterpreting that. Lack of social awareness comes from the lack of understanding unwritten rules/expectations, not clearly defined LAWS.", "I think the point is supposed to be: he might not have considered it stealing since he *presumably* didn\u2019t intend to keep it.  A lot of ND peeps often understand the boundaries of social rules differently, which leads to situations like OP\u2019s.\n\nA better lesson should be \u201cdon\u2019t touch someone else\u2019s property without permission\u201d but there are plenty of entitled people in the world (many are posted about here) so that\u2019s not a guarantee for *anyone*.\n\nNone of this excuses the employee\u2019s behaviour; but I understand the point u/slpnrpnzl is trying to make.", "You have to be bored and trolling to really try to be arguing this right now. Lacking social awareness could actually be a reason someone steals. \nIf you\u2019d like the definition since you apparently have no idea what social awareness is:\n\nSocial Awareness: The ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others, including those from diverse backgrounds and cultures. The ability to understand social and ethical norms for behavior and to recognize family, school, and community resources and supports.\n\nTherefore lacking it could lead to them taking the phone out of someone\u2019s hand to see what\u2019s on the screen without asking. Op\u2019s phone wasn\u2019t stolen \ud83e\udd23", "Intent means nothing in certain situations. For example, you might not INTEND to hurt someone's feelings, but if the result is feelings were hurt, that still means you did it. They didn't intend to steal the phone, but it WAS taken without permission from OP.", "I personally would describe a stranger aggressively taking my phone out of my hand, without permission, as stealing it. Idk what you could describe it as, but that is the laws definition.", "I agree, hence my last paragraph.", "Please refer back to my initial comment you responded to where I said I don\u2019t think there was Ill intent and you decided to badger on about how it\u2019s stealing.", "would you like to discuss the definition of stealing?\n\nthe action or offense of taking another person's property without permission or legal right and without intending to return it; theft\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to emphasize *without intending to return it* \n\nBut thanks for your contribution and hopefully you can educate yourself on social barriers individuals with disabilities face so your dramatic ass can take a chill pill and be more understanding!!"]}
