Why the hell is someone in his condition allowed to give out prescriptions?

Don't just leave negative feedback; that will just be ignored. Contact customer service @ the website and file a complaint. \n\nThe issue is nothing to do with the employee being mentally disabled.

The number of times you mentioned that the worker is disabled is problematic. But NTA for wanting what you paid for.", "Yeah maybe they are rotating him through different positions in the store but there should be someone monitoring him the same way there should be someone making sure that no employee interaction devolves into yelling.", "Still medication. \n\nPlus imagine had that been Adderall you needed instead.", "Yeah but it may not have had anything to do with him being disabled.", "because I\u2019m conflicted. i was irritated because i had a hard time understand what they were saying and the way they behaved when i tried to explain that i received the wrong product, but at the same time I know it\u2019s not this person\u2019s fault and I don\u2019t know their situation.", "I\u2019m not saying that it did, but I don\u2019t think anyone who works in customer service should be aggressive with a customer.", "But that\u2019s not what you said, you made the entire post about him being disabled", "I think the point is that she feels bad *because* he was disabled. If he was an able-bodied/minded individual, she wouldn\u2019t feel as guilty inputting a negative review. However, a disabled person might have an underlying reason that caused impatience, misunderstanding, etc\u2026 so the negative interaction isn\u2019t necessarily a personality issue as much as a medical one. So, criticism of that seems more harsh than just criticizing an asshole. \n\nI see where OP is coming from. She\u2019s still NTA though. Reasonable accommodation indicates an employee needs to be able to meet the core functions of a position with or without reasonable accommodation. If an employee\u2019s disability cannot be accommodated in order to meet the core function of a position, they do not need to be employed. If this employees disability precludes them from being polite to customers in a customer service position, they shouldn\u2019t be in that position. \n\nFor example if a person can\u2019t work in a paint store due to fumes, the company has an obligation to attempt to provide them with reasonable accommodation, i.e. a filtration mask or similar device. If this reasonable accommodation still doesn\u2019t work, the employee can be let go legally, despite it being a medical disability. Same reason someone in a wheelchair can\u2019t sue for not being hired for a landscaping job."]}
