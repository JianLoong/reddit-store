You are 32 years old and your mother doesn't have the authority to tell you how to address anyone, if you don't want to call the man she married \"stepdad.\" You are generous to provide a hotel room for mother and her husband and invite them for lunch after they appeared without warning.

Never feel bad about defending yourself.", "I spent the last 5 years being followed by a team composed of a nutritionist, a therapist, and a dietician because I do have a sugar addiction and I was worried about my health and weight at the time.

Obviously some stranger butting in on your personal choices and thinking they have any say on how you live isn't able to have a productive conversation about anything.  Don't stoop to their level and don't engage - it seems like doing so has made it uncomfortable for other people who were just trying to mind their own business and enjoy their day - so it sounds like you might become TA if you don't either refuse to engage with them around others, or stop responding to things that don't deserve responding to.", "You could have done without the pregnant comment", "They both sound poisonous!!
