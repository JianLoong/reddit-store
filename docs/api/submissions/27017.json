As long as its basically a \"hi nice to meet you! just wanted to make sure you exist! Have a great night and thanks for taking care of my daughter!\" and arent actually asking any real questions. THAT would be strange.", "NTA - given your daughter\u2019s age, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to want to verify that these people actually exist and are hosting a sleepover.", "NTA. Good job, Mom.", "NTA I was 16 not that long ago and while my parents never had this request it seems very reasonable. We also live in a small town where everyone kind of knows eachother even if it's just by sight so I feel like it could be different in your case. I'm not a parent I don't think I would feel comfortable letting my child sleep at a complete strangers house. I also feel like the friends parent would appreciate getting to know you over a coffee or something.\n\nEdit to add it might be weird but it's reasonable so who cares?", "NTA. You\u2019re still responsible for her safety and well-being, I would want to meet them as well.", "NAH If it\u2019s just a \u201chi nice to meet you can I get your number in case of emergencies\u201d while you drop her off that\u2019s fine, anymore than that is a little excessive for 16.", "NTA you get one chance to keep her safe. There are too many people who would do bad things to kids. Meet them talk to them, ask tough questions. If you don\u2019t and something happens to her you will never forgive yourself", "Meeting might be a little far tbh I for one never would have  liked that at 16 but it\u2019s definitely reasonable to ask for the friends parents number and just have a chat to know what kind of family you are dealing with", "NTA Knowing where your kids are and with whom is a reasonable expectation.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with this at all, you seem like a great parent!", "A phone call should be enough.\n\nIt's not going to be convenient to physically meet them if you work.", "NTA. No way. It\u2019s a simple request. If she doesn\u2019t want it to happen then she doesn\u2019t need to sleep over. I wonder what the other girls parents would expect if their child was spending the night at your house.", "NTA", "NTA - You've done the right thing. One day, she will appreciate you for this.", "INFO: *Why* do you want to meet them?", "Your daughter has zero clue what she's talking about.", "NTA. Not weird at all to care about your daughter\u2019s safety\u2014 just being a good parent. If this is indeed a legit sleep over with friends, it would also be helpful to the parents hosting to have a way to reach you in case of any emergencies and vice versa.", "Nta. Good chance they are going parting all night and the other girl is telling her parents she\u2019s staying at your house", "YTA. Do you know the difference between 16 and 6? Good god, what are you preparing her for, middle school? But the cord already", "YTA.  She's 16.  Nealy an adult.  You need to learn how to not treat her as a young child.", "INFO- What is your reason behind wanting to meet the parents and what internal bias do you have for people who are lower-income? I had a friend when I was 16 whose mother was very nice, but(for various reasons that were out of her and my friend\u2019s control) lived in a house that was in desperate need of repair and rarely clean. If my mother had ever seen their home, I would not have been allowed back. That said, I was never in danger at her home and we were both good kids. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily call you an AH, but if you trust your daughter, I think you should let her make her own choices about who her friends are and if SHE feels safe having a sleepover. The only reason you would need to meet the parents is if your daughter hasn\u2019t given you a reason to trust her judgement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mom did the same thing to me when I young. I resented it then and I\u2019m so grateful for her concerns now that I\u2019m an adult. I wasn\u2019t permitted to sleep over a girl\u2019s house because the parents were extremely lax. Those girls that did sleepover got caught drinking, smoking, doing drugs and trying to meet guys in a chat room. We were all 15/16 y/o, this was in the 90\u2019s. They were giving out their address to grown men in chat rooms inviting them to come over and hook up. Sleepovers at her house were suspended. Thankful I wasn\u2019t there to get looped into all of that!", "NTA. As a teenager, the fact that she\u2019s trying to get around this might imply she\u2019s not headed exactly where she tells you she\u2019s headed. meet the friend and the parents at school pickup or something or invite them over for dinner.", "The one time my mom opted not to meet the parents of the girl whose house I was spending the night at, they ended up being racist and the night was very awkward.

This was the norm growing up in the 2000s lmao", "I honestly do think she's a little old for this much oversight - UNLESS you have reason not to trust her that is.", "It\u2019s not too much to ask but you can\u2019t actually tell what kids are like just from meeting their parents. You could downplay it. Instead of telling your child you want to meet the parents, give the kids a ride somewhere and casually go to the door and say hi.", "Also swapping numbers with the other parent", "Or that they will actually be home", "My mom always did this. Pretty sure it was a vibe check to make sure the parents didn\u2019t give off drug addict vibes or something.", "To piggy back off of this, I had a friend named Samantha and spent the night at her house almost every weekend. Samantha didn't exist and I was usually at my boyfriend's house or at a huge house party.\n\nNTA and I don't think this is unreasonable at all.", "In the simplest terms - a vibe check. I just want to know there is a coherent, responsible adult that will be there.", "Yes critical detail i left out oops"]}
