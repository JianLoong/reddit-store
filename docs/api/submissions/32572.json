My sister had reached out to me and my husband, Tim (33 m), and asked if she could move in with us for the time being until a little after the baby is born. Me and my husband  said yes because her and her husband has been nothing but kind to us.\n\nFast forward to now, my sister had given birth to a beautiful baby boy. We had decorated a nursery and had everything ready. After her son was born, she has been tired lately and wanting to get some time by herself. She then asked me and my husband if we could watch her son as she and her husband went out. We understood that she wanted some time to take the weight off her shoulder so we agreed. We created a bond with our nephew. \n\nSometimes Trinity would come home with food or clothes or toys for the baby. It has been going on multiple times a week. I was starting to get skeptical. Nor does she and her husband have a job and they barely spend any time with their son anymore. I notice that Trinity and Brian had stopped coming home with stuff for the baby. I told my sister that she had to spend more time with her son, and that he needed his mom. She only replied with, \"He'll be fine.\" ONE day I checked my sister's Facebook to find out that she has been going out to parties and bars over the past weeks. When I confronted her about it, she only brushed it off as her trying to live her life. As if she didn't give life to someone.

Buying things with who knows money. I texted my sister what happened and she came home enraged with her husband by her side.\n\nShe then started yelling at me for brain washing her child into thinking that I was his mom. I yelled at her, saying that she had stopped being a mother the moment she stopped mothering her son.

She complained and my mother started accusing me over the phone. I told her what happened ever since Trinity has given birth. Still, she says that I was too harsh and was not the child's mother.

They (being both sides, caregivers and mom) had been teaching her the word mama before and after mom lost custody, and they only ever used it to refer to the mother, but the little girl decided herself to assign that to the woman who was doing most of her care and was with her most of the time. \n\nMom lost her crap, but it wasn't anything anyone taught the little girl, she'd been given a word associated with a woman who was the most present in her life, then for reasons she didn't understand, who that woman was changed. She was too little to know the term didn't just go with whoever she saw the most of and took care of her. \n\nSo it's not *impossible* that they were using the term mama to refer to mom and the kid got the association mixed up and used it for \"woman who is around most often\" rather than \"woman who I barely see who calls herself mama\"\n\nNot entirely likely, but possible. \n\nThough my first reaction would have been to teach the kid a different term for her (auntie or a short nickname) and not tell mom what happened because I know how a negligent mom reacts to something like that.", "A lot of babies will say \u201cma-ma\u201d without knowing what it means.

By us speaking at and **around** them. Yes encouraging the baby to speak helps but just talking around a baby can make it learn words bc thats how learning any language works. You see body language and the tone of voice and the words and see the reactions and *learn* thru that. Also its encpuraged to speak around children more becuase it helps them learn language more they hear it. The baby will *want* to communicate and try to copy the adult taking care of it, and maybe the baby gets sat in front of the tv and copies that language too. \n\nMaybe op talks to thr baby about their actual mama and the baby copied that?\n\nAlso d sounds arent easier than m sounds? At least to me i think the m sounds is softer to a baby as all it requires is a humming like noise, where as d is harsher and requires more tone inflection depending on the vowel following it.

And as I said before, even if the OP taught him the word mama, because maybe she has some issues following the miscarriages, that means she spent way more time with the baby than the actual \"mother\" did.\nWhy faking a story to hear that you are not an AH? And how can you tell that his story is true?", "Exactly! I have an 8 month old. It's a huge financial and time-consuming  commitment to take care of a baby. It's exhausting. OP makes it sound like they casually watched her nephew. No mention of the baby's age is strange as most posts will include age.", "Babies can make sounds that sound like words at very younger ages.  My son said da-da (or da-ja) when he was only a couple of moths old.  He never repeated it, just two random sounds that formed a word. \n\nSo a young baby could easily make  sounds  like Ma-ma long before they actually know what that are saying or know how to speak.\n\nWhile I do not doubt the story is fake, it is not impossible to believe a very young baby randomly calls someone Mama.\n\nMy son is now 7 months and makes all sorts of sounds t", "I had the same though! Thank you for the link", "I've noticed a lot of stories seem to show up in pairs. It makes you wonder if people are running tests, somehow.", "Yes! Thank you for the link.", "I think you are mistaken about the child \u201cassigning a name to their caretaker\u201d. From the sounds of it the child is only a few months old at that age they aren\u2019t speaking \u201ctrue words\u201d, it\u2019s just babble. Infants often babble sounds like \u201cmama\u201d or \u201cdada\u201d This can often be misunderstood by parents as the infant speaking their first words when really the infant is just experimenting with their voice.", "Or if the child watches an ounce of Ms rachel, the kid would quickly pick up on the word mama.", "I was just trying to give benefit of the doubt jeez", "They probably are. All fake stores looking to see which o es will get the most attention", "Perhaps they\u2019d pick up the \u201csound\u201d if really saturated with the program, but children who are developing early language skills on a typical timeline (9-16 months), aren\u2019t picking up random sounds from screens and speakers and then cognitively choosing who to assign those signs to. Human development just doesn\u2019t work that way.", "It doesn't sound like the baby assigned its aunt as \"mama\", it sounds like it started babbling mama and the aunt was the first person who heard it."]}
