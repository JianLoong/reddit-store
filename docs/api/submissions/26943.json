You probably should have warned him that they'd bite but he is fine and will have learned a lesson about listening and about wildlife.  \n\nYour sister's approach may work for her, but (and I know this will freak some people out) I think kids have to learn that consequences do actually exist at some point.

You're doing this kid a favor, and his parents aren't. A 9yr is ready to learn that actions have consequences, and that there's a reason an adult will tell you to NOT do something. If your SIL and brother keep being overprotective, the kid will have to learn this the hard way.", "NTA The kid had to find out. \n\nI bet he will leave the ants alone next time. And maybe even, I dunno, *listen* to you next time?", "NTA \n\n\n> I said (jokingly) he's a nine year old boy not a puppy. \n\nThis but not jokingly. \n\nYou already told him twice. Ant bites won't kill him or scar him, so if he didn't want to listen, letting it happen was perfectly acceptable. It's not playing with fire or jumping off a cliff. It's ant bites.", "Yep, well now he knows not to mess with ants. Quite the valuable lesson. While distracting him in the moment might have avoided him getting bitten right then and there, what's gonna happen when no one notices him going to battle with the ant colony. Now he knows the concept of strategic retreat ;)\nNTA. This is called tough love.", "NTA mom needs to chill. He is 9 and old enough to listen.

That's how kids learn for themselves and don't turn into little whiny momma boys.", "Nta, some lessons in life you have to learn the hard way", "NTAAA- the kid is NINE not three. Stupid games stupid prizes. Bet he won\u2019t do it again", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s 9\u2026.how does he not know some insects bite?  I never had to learn by experience, but it was something I knew.", "If you're gonna be dumb, ya gotta be tough.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  As I was reading this I thought you were talking about a toddler or very young child.  At 9 a kid knows enough not to stir the beast (or ants) and you did warn him.  Physically taking away the stick would just make you the bad person and he wouldn't have learned anything.  Which is why he is 9 and doing dumb shit like stirring up an ant nest!", "It is very simple stop using the word DONT. Give him the positive command instead.  For example  If I tell you not to think of a bar of your favourite chocolate you instantly think.of that choc. Same with kids. Dont touch and they touch . Tell him to.leave it alone. That is a positive command", "NTA - nephew learned a practical lesson in FAFO. You told him repeatedly not to do it, he continued to do it. He'll know better next time (this from a Gen Xer, and FAFO was pretty much our motto when it came to personal safety, playing with ants/hornets/wasp nests etc.  Don't get me started on the death traps that were the local playground.)", "NTA.  He's 9.  He should know better.  And if he doesn't know better, well, now he does!  Maybe if his parents taught him to listen better he wouldn't have had to suffer the painful consequences of his actions.\n\nBesides, imagine the hellfire and brimstone if you had physically manhandled dear nephew when he didn't listen.  You were in a no win situation OP.", "NTA\n\nSome lessons have to be learnt the hard way. \n\nAnd unless you live somewhere that has fire ants or some other species that can actually cause serious issues all the kid got was 3 ant bites. Hardly a serious wound", "Oh hell no, NTA. I came prepared to be upset that you let a small child get bitten by ants, and found out the kid is ***nine***. And was poking an anthill with a stick. And then held onto the stick.\n\nYou may have just saved this kid\u2019s life by letting him experience the consequences of his own actions.", "Hell she expect you to do, drop kick the kid to get the ants off??? NTA", "NTA you taught a valuable lesson. Besides where were the parents? Obviously not caring for their kid!", "NTA- kids often have to experience the result of an action before truly understanding it. Even if you tell them what the result will be, they need to see for themselves. If you took the stick and distracted him he probably would've come back to the ant hill at some point to sate his curiosity. He's also old enough to understand that ants can bite, it's not like he's a toddler with no understanding of what could happen. At the end of the day, it was three ant bites, he'll live.", "NTA this is like literally the safest and harmless lesson you could give. Unless you have like some killer ants around. \nI'm sure if he was putting his hands in a fire you would have stopped him. He fucked around and found out and the consequence is a few little itchy bug bites now.", "At 9 years old? NTA\n\nAnd I need to do better at doing the same thing, I step in and stop too much. Some kids learn through action, not word.", "Lmfao NTA at all dude, the kid didn't listen and then learnt the hard way unfortunately, I guarantee he won't do that again, dunno why the parents are mad when he learnt a valuable lesson for free", "You would have been the A had the boy been, like, a two year old. A two year old would have needed more than words to stop, and should have also been redirected. A nine year old is old enough that your words and warnings should have been enough. If he hadn't learned by then that ants bite, he sure has now in a safe, contained why.", "NTA. My parents did the same thing. Told us not to mess with any hill. We messed with ant hill. We got bit and cried. They never had to tell us again. Well actually, my brother  would have to be carried away because anytime he\u2019d see an ant hill he\u2019d shove his hand in it.", "Hes 9 unless he doesnt live wherever you are normally he already knows not to mess with anthills.", "At nine I would let fire ants sting me for fun - he\u2019s fine, it doesn\u2019t hurt much\nPlus you told him not to do it, he ignored you, he got to see why he shouldn\u2019t ignore everything, well if he\u2019s smart lol. Some kids still don\u2019t learn", "NTA unless they were fire ants and my answer would be different.", "Lol, broh the amount of things I did as a kid that hurt me is astounding. Also I made sure not to say shit about it", "Nta At 9 I lived in the country and we always tried to trick other kids to touch the electric fence, it was always funny to hear them scream.   Snitches got tied down to the ground for 30 mins with honey poured over them.  Or shoved in the goose enclosure with us blocking the door.   But that was when we were kids ,what we did to others we had also experienced the same back.  \n\nAs an adult when my eldest was a young toddler he picked up a lemon at the supermarket, normally he\u2019d munch on a piece of fruit  as we shopped but this time he had his eyes on the lemon.  I expressed to him the lemon had a nasty taste, you don\u2019t want to bite into it.  Don\u2019t do it, stop, you won\u2019t be happy biting that lemon to finally telling him it was yucky! Erik yuck!  But the decision was up to him to make.  \n\nGiving me a cheeky look he proceeded to bite the lemon and indeed found it an unpleasant experience.  My mother at the time thought I was being poor to my son, but I told her while it\u2019s unpleasant taste it wasn\u2019t going to hurt him and now he knows that I told him not to proceed with it, I had his well-being at stake.   So the next time he\u2019s told no, he will listen more closely before he hurts himself.  \n\nBoys are naturally risk takers and it\u2019s good for them to experience a negative reaction after taking a risk from time to time.  It makes them slow down a bit more and give more consideration to what they\u2019re about to do.", "NTA. Clearly this kid has not been allowed to experience consequences much, and that\u2019s not a good thing. He\u2019s **nine** and frankly shouldn\u2019t even *need* warnings not to poke ants.", "Lol consequences are tough", "NTA\n\nIf you took the stick. He would have poked the ants on another day, and might not have had such a good outcome. Now he won't do it again.", "lol.  NTA.", "A teachable moment. NTA", "Yeah I figure this is a pretty safe lesson, if he was trying to play with a cotton mouth or something I would have obviously gotten much more involved", "Shit I wouldn't have even given him benedryl cream for 3 ant bites.\n\nHonestly I probably wouldn't have done anything at all.  9 is old enough to deal with the bug bites you get from fucking with bugs.", "Better to learn to listen *now* and with Ants, than later und with more dire consequences.\n\nNTA", "Happy cake day!", "I mean ok, fair enough but I think we both know the kid wouldn\u2019t listen.\n\nAlso, sitting back with a beer after giving a warning isn\u2019t authoritarian lol.", "Should he also have to explain that the sun is bright? You put NINE-YEARS-OLD in caps as if it helps your point, when every sane person is wondering how in the hell that kid has never been bitten by an ant before. Most people learn that lesson before they learn their ABCs.", "Op stated in a comment it wasnt the first time he got bit by ants.\n\nEdit: spelling error", "Nine year olds from experience, not words. - a former nine year old.", "Hes been bitten by ants before. \n\nDo people carry around epi pens in case they're kid has an allergic reaction to something? There's like thousands of things he could exposed to in the day there's a chance he could be allergic to.", "Also, he's NINE. If he were a toddler, I'd feel differently. NTA", "Nah. Letting the kid get bitten by the ants is fine, but intentionally withholding a minor bit of pain relief from them afterwards to \"teach them a lesson\" is just pathetic cruelty. The lesson was learned from being bitten in the first place.", "Yeah a few ant bites is nothing I don't know what ants these were but when I was that age I used to let ants crawl on my hands for fun", "Yeah, the big cow-killers look velvety and gloriously pettable, as do many of the hairy caterpillars, and an adventurous nine-year-old might straight-up poke an assassin bug...", "Exactly.", "Thanks! Don't worry about this too much. It will all be a funny story someday.", "Nine-year-olds are more than capable of understanding that ants bite. You can sit them down and talk to and reason with them fairly easily. You could do this all the way down to a five-year-old.", "He's been bitten by ants before anyway when he was a toddler he sat on an ant hill. That one was actually really sad poor kid literally had ants in his pants", "I was never been bitten by an ant till I was in my 20s...", "> Do people carry around epi pens in case they're [sic] kid has an allergic reaction to something? \n\nNo, but most people ALSO don't sit there with a bucket of popcorn waiting for a kid to have a run-in with a venomous creature.", "Yeah, you distract 2 year olds, not nine year olds.", "Exactly! He\u2019s 9 he should understand that actions have consequences and listen to the adults who are looking out for him. You redirect and distract toddlers who don\u2019t have the reasoning skills to actually listen, 9 is too old to need to be redirected like that.", "Gonna be real with you, 3 ant bites is such a minor common occurrence I just never would have thought to put anything on it.\n\nGTFO of here with \"pathetic cruelty\"\n\nAnt bites are a solid 0.5/10 on the pain scale.  3 isn't enough to bother doing anything about.\n\nIt'll hurt a few minutes then be mildly itchy for a few days.", "Not offering and withholding are two different things, tbf. At 9, he can ask for help or get his parents. At 9, I was well versed in where the Benadryl cream was. I was allergic to outdoors.", "Heaven forbid that small child grasp a twig and find out the hard way a praying mantis was there! The mild discomfort might kill them!", "When did you learn that ants can bite though?", "Depends entirely on the type of ant", "Congratulations on having more of a pain tolerance than a nine year old boy. Your medal should arrive about 3-5 business days after I find a fuck to give.", "Looking at you bullet ant \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40"]}
