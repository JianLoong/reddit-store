I\u2019ve never heard of anybody sharing an umbrella with a complete stranger. \nI think the hitting her with the same sentence was justified, she only found him intresting when he was useful and she thought he would help her cause she\u2019s a woman and he tried to talk to her.

Pretty funny, and she kinda had it coming", "NTA. Women aren't allowed to use you when it's convenient.  Bonus points for using her own words against her.

All interactions are transactional, especially at first.\n\nWomen love to tell you they don't owe you anything, but when they need something from you it's a different story. She expected you to say yes because she is a woman.", "NTA for a few reasons. The first being her calling you names.\n\nNow, I'm a cis woman, not a very social one, but I do know how to interact with strangers in a social mixer setting. You can absolutely keep the interaction polite and brief while brushing someone off instead of being rude, and not even in a \"this man might turn violent if reject him explicitly way\" but more in a \"politeness is part of the social contract unless you give me a reason to behave otherwise\" way.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point. You, a woman, have rudely brushed off a male stranger and he didn't make a scene or react negatively to you. Okay. But then, you go up to this same man, alone and in a vulnerable position, asking him not only for a favor but also telling him you'll accompany him to another location if he does you that favor?? OP is a decent human being, if petty, and that woman was lucky for it but she could have easily turned up as a statistic if it had been a raging, violent misogynistic fuck. \n\nShe's not just an AH, she's got TSTL tendencies, sounds like", "NTA.  Not in the least. You were not good enough to share a conversation with but you are good enough when you have something they want. Nahhh. I\u2019m good.", "NTA. She's not interested and now you're not interested. You don't owe her anything.", "The way you described the umbrella makes me think it wouldn't do much if both of you were under it. NAH because asking for help isn't bad but sharing an umbrella with a stranger also sounds kinda awkward", "Not only an asshole but a huge dick", "NTA. I love it when entitled people learn a lesson.", "NTA. My small umbrella that I bring everywhere barely keeps me dry, I would never share regardless", "I think this post is fake or for just seeking validation from fellow men\n\nI have seen too many skit videos, that a man approached a girl on street, and she replies with she isnt interested and then her scooter's tire is punchured/or she asks to do a phone call and the men replies with they arent interested. \n\nIn this case, if its actually real\n\nYou approached her in a CLUB, so it's definitely not for just starting a normal friendly conversation, and not all women just have to engage in a conversation with you, she wasnt rude, she was simply not interested in having conversations with men. (Ik you or some other men will def ask Why was she in a club then?, well she could have came with her friends or her boyfriend, or just to simply get a drink and dance, to forget a bad memory)\n\nFor the umbrella case, I have mixed reactions\nKinda both NTA and YTA, \nNTA for not sharing your umbrella, you dont owe anyone anything and if it usually rains in your area, she should have thought more when going out. \n\nBut YTA for using the same \"sorry im not interested\" line, because it just showed that her rejecting your \"friendly\" convo hurt your fragile masculinity, she also doesnt owe you anything, she doesnt have to talk to someone if she doesn't want to. \nBy using that line for just wanting to use your umbrella you are making it sound like she asked to stay at your place or smth.\n\nSorry but according to the specific last line that you wrote, you also wanted something from her, see no one does friendly conversations in a club and if it really was friendly with no other intention, you could have approached any other girl in the club after her rejection, if you simply just wanted to be friends you wouldn't have been so offended by her, you could have shared the umbrella, showed her your not some weird guy, i mean she didnt know you, but still trusted you enough to walk so close to you under one umbrella, that chance you could have grabbed to actually become her friend and talk at the train station but you lost the chance because of your ego. So yes YTA", "Shit ton of commenters who don\u2019t read what judgements on this sub are. \n\nTaking the most uncharitable interpretations of her response, she was a bit assholey (but probably understandable considering the context). But you denied her specifically because she rejected you, which also makes you an asshole. \n\nRight judgement here is ESH.", "N T A for saying no to sharing, but YTA for the petty phrasing. Life isn't about balancing scales. Odds are she felt safe asking to share an umbrella because you took no for an answer earlier (which men in bars aren't known for doing), and then you decided to make the situation about your own feelings. You could've just said \"sorry, it's too small for two\" and that would've been fine.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t really think that this happened, but you don\u2019t owe a stranger anything that you don\u2019t want to share.", "The woman didn\u2019t owe you a conversation but it would have been a nice gesture to share your umbrella", "NTA. I am a human woman and what you said was perfect.", "NTA. She was rude to you for no reason so you have not obligation to be polite to her.  Actions have consequences.  You could have been a gent, but you are not required to be polite to someone who was rude.  Be petty.  Not making the world a better place for us all to live in, but you be you.", "So answer this, if you hadn't spoken to her and she hadn't spoken to you but at the time of leaving had asked if you would share your umbrella with her on the way would you have shared your umbrella or told her to buzz off?", "NTA. It's weird that she would even ask you after not even being willing to even talk to you earlier. And I think you can be glad you didn't end up having any sort of relationship with her, she's probably a user and not a good person.", "If she can't take it she shouldn't dish it.  NTA", "This is a fascinating question. OTOH, you're totally full of shit when you deny that you were hitting on her. Come on dude, don't talk to us like we're idiots. And you undoubtedly said \"sorry not interested\" to her because you were salty that she rejected you, which is a dickish thing to do. Not super dickish, just a little bit.\n\nHowever it's equally dickish, in my opinion, to ask a favor of someone right after you reject them. Not the worst thing ever but I do think it's just a little bit dickish. More to the point, though, is the fact that sharing an umbrella with a stranger is *not* common courtesy. I think it's a litttttttle bit weird to ask a stranger if you can share their umbrella with them, and although I myself probably would do it if asked, by no means is someone a jerk if they *don't* say yes to that. It's totally reasonable to say no to that ask.\n\nAll of that being said: Even if you would have said no otherwise, I believe that your specific comment *was* a bit retaliatory. \n\nSo, my final determination is ESH.", "NTA.  She is entitled. Red flags all around.", "NTA. You didn't owe her the discomfort of sharing ur umbrella", "Clearly you fail to understand the classic notion of double standards. You should have been happy she ultimately found a use for you, but you failed to step up.  Every woman, no matter her attitude, is entitled to use of your chivalry. Tsk tsk.\n\nYour response to her request was perfect.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for not sharing your umbrella, but it does imply that you think someone should be punished or taught a lesson for not being interested in you which does make you an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like she got a much needed lesson.  And you're right, you don't need to (and shouldn't) put up with people that are only interested if they can \"get something from you\".", "NAH but your actions proved she was 100% right in rejecting you. You're a petty and desperate dude.", "I think it may depend on her tone when she said she wasn\u2019t interested. If she interrupted you and was generally bitchy about it then meh, she got what she deserved. If she politely said it to you then you maybe were over the line.", "NTA and well played sir!!", "NTA for not sharing your umbrella but YTA for saying that to her. She didn\u2019t go to the club to be flirted with, doesn\u2019t mean she has to get drenched on her way to the train.", "NTA\nAll the people here whining would have cheered  if roles were reversed.", "Lol NTA", "You could be a nice guy, she didn't have to be nice, and then you didn't have to be nice. NTA. No harm no fowl. If it was a bigger umbrella sure but I have a personal one for me. Barely keeps me dry.", "NTA  \npetty yes but AH no", "I don't know if you're the asshole, but really, she did you a favor but telling you not to waste your time on her. And you were going to the train station anyway.", "Bro is looking for assurance from the few people that lack human decency and empathy because he knows he\u2019s the asshole. Let\u2019s say you didn\u2019t have the interaction with her in the club and she comes up to you outside asking if she can share your umbrella. Would you have responded the same way? If not then your ego needs to be checked dude. Just because your butt hurt doesn\u2019t mean you need to take it out on someone or quit being a decent human being. 100% asshole dude. It\u2019s people like you that make this world all the more shitty to live in.", " NTA. If she had not insulted you, I would have gone with N A H.

Because she dared to turn you down.", "Nta she has no right to your space", "YTA", "As a female, NTA. She's well within her rights not to talk to you, you're well within your rights not to share your umbrella. Would she talk to you if you did, or would it be stony silence? Who's to know? Let her get a taxi.", "LOL you are not only not an asshole but that is the caliber of response everyone wishes they had said", "NTA", "YTA. So women are only ppl to you when you have a chance of fucking them?", "YTA- clearly the rejection hurt your ego and you decided if she wasn\u2019t going to fuck you, she doesn\u2019t deserve the umbrella. It\u2019s hilarious because you said \u2018why should I help people who only give me the time of the day if they want something?\u2019, but can\u2019t see that YOU are that person.", "NTA - She had a right to refuse engagement just as you had a right to refuse to share your umbrella. She could have said something nicer or in a pleasant tone rather than rudely. I\u2019m sure she got home just fine.", "YTA\n\nHowever I don\u2019t think you behaved unacceptably either. It was kind of funny.\n\nThink about it like this. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be hit on, the most polite thing they can do is give you a quick \u201csorry, not interested.\u201d If someone doesn\u2019t want to share an umbrella, they can give a more polite answer than that. \u201cSorry, I\u2019d just like some personal space right now.\u201d Or in your case, \u201cSorry, but you hurt my feelings earlier so I\u2019d rather not be physically close to you right now\u201d would be more polite. \n\nYou were definitely an asshole but she probably should have seen the funny side of it tbh. I\u2019d call her mildly foolish for asking a favor from you soon after rejecting you.", "Yta. Not because you didn't want to share your umbrella, but because your reason for not doing so is that you took her politely turning you down as an insult. You said you were okay but apparently not. You effectively wanted to dole out a petty punishment for her not wanting to chat. \n\nWell, looks like she had the right idea: you proved to be a petty entitled AH.", "YTA\nYou have no obligation to share your umbrella with anyone, but not sharing *just* because she was forward with her disinterest with you makes you an AH.", "You are an asshole, but just because of the way you went about it. If you don't want to share your umbrella it's fine, no need to be a dick lol", "NTA. You made it clear by your other comments that you were there to socialize, not just \u2018hook up.\u2019 She was honestly rude for inferring that you were only speaking with her to get with her, so her response of, \u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d is pretty obnoxious. Then, lo and behold, it begins to rain and you come prepared! She sees this and decides that she could use you after all. Like..No. She can deal with the consequences of  being presumptuous. Also, who the fuck asks to share an umbrella with a stranger?", "NTA she can dish it but can\u2019t take it. Fuck her :)", "NTA", "Depends on if you would have shared the umbrella with her has she not rejected you. If you would have, then yeah, YTA. You don't have to share your umbrella but you didn't share yours for a petty reason.", "NTA! It's your umbrella. She should have packed better. I 100% would have done the same thing.  I applaud you for the perfect response! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfc6", "YTA", "YTA. \nYou went to the club, tried to chat up a woman and she rejected you politely.  She's not the AH for rejecting you. \n\nShe asks to share your umbrella. You tell her no because you're going in a different direction, the umbrella is too small, you're in a hurry, etc. The reason doesn't really matter. You don't need a reason to not share an umbrella with a stranger. You're not an AH. \n\nSo far, so good. No assholes. Just two people who went out independently, going back separately and a lot of rain. \n\nExcept then you use the same line that she used to reject you politely, except you don't mean it politely. You're being petty at this point because you see this as a power flip and you want to rub it in. She calls you a dick, which is kind of an AH move but you started escalating first so you win the YTA title. \n\nThen you come to Reddit and complain in the comments that woman no longer appreciate gentleman so you're not going to act like one.

She had every right to turn down your advances, and no, you\u2019re not convincing anyone here that you approached a woman at a club for platonic reasons. \n\nYour response, however, was petty and rude.

Allowing yourself to be made uncomfortable to not hurt a man\u2019s ego?", "He doesnt owe her anything yes, he shouldn't share the umbrella if he doesnt want to\nBut using the same line just showed he couldnt take in the fact that he got rejected so now he will just be sour about it.\n\nWhere did i write that he should have shared the umbrella, i replied to someone who said the woman was unkind, simply asking how was she unkind.\n\nHonestly you negative voting on the comment that just said, women dont need to engage in conversations she doenst want to\nJust shows how you and OP both see women, i dont need to argue with you any further", "Im a woman too, but she wasnt rude at all\nNow imagine you are in a club for any reason\n1) either with your friends\n2) came with your boyfriend (not in this case but just an example)\n3) had a bad day and just wanted to forget about it\n4) simply wanted a drink and wanted to dance\n5) your into girls\n6) wanted to have sex \n\nThese are mainly the reasons women go to the club\nNow imagine you are just having fun by yourself when some man approaches you wanting to have a conversation.\nNow you are feeling like you dont wanna talk to men, or dont want to have friends\nSorry im not interested is the most polite reply you can give. Instead of forcing yourself into a conversation with someone because you dont wanna hurt their fragile masculinity of being rejected. \n\nImagine your into girls, and a man approaches you, what would u tell him? You dont owe him anything to explain in detail why you don't wanna talk to him, just simply say sorry not interested and move on.\nBoys should just respect it, that the girl isnt interested neither in being friends nor in having sex. So just leave her alone\nHow is that rude?\n\nYou tell me what was she supposed to do? Force herself into a conversation?\nAre you really a woman? Or a guy pretending to be a woman to get his point through\nIf you really are a woman, please start standing up for women, if you got enough male validation you wanted because supporting this is just disgusting coming from a woman itself", "Ohh tysm typical American grammer police for correcting my grammer. I would have been in jail if you did not correct me. Life saver", "Okay sure buddy, men approach women in clubs , that they likely find attractive, to just have a conversation with no end goal in mind. I\u2019m sure that happens all the time", "It\u2019s really not shitty to say you\u2019re not interested in someone, she didn\u2019t insult him, she wasn\u2019t rude, she just said she wasn\u2019t interested because she wasn\u2019t. Women don\u2019t need to act like they\u2019re interested in men out of \u201cpoliteness\u201d so they don\u2019t bruise their egos, and in many cases unless you\u2019re blunt and just say \u2018not interested\u2019 men won\u2019t take the hint and leave you alone.", "You are stuck at the umbrella part, did you completely went blind at the rejection part?", "this is also why I think the story is made up to create fake discourse about gender double-standards", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to convince me but it\u2019s not working", "It would have been the decent thing for him to do to share his umbrella. But he sucks so he didn't.", "You could walk 5 city blocks and have 5 different people ask you for a dollar. Are you an asshole if you don\u2019t give every one of them a dollar? Are you an asshole for not doing every act of charity you possibly could? \n\nI don\u2019t believe so.", "So was she an asshole for shutting him down, when she could have been nice about it? \n\nI think so. So she didn\u2019t deserve his kindness.", "Cutting off an introduction to say \u201cnot interested\u201d is hella rude.", "how many times have you done it? im at zero. how many times have shared an umbrella with a stranger in the middle of the night to the bus stop?", "well it is being nice, but they're under no obligation to if they don't want to", "Honestly that's being careless, you don't know what kind of person you meet in the streets", "Honestly, this is the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever been downvoted on. It\u2019s much more unusual when people *don\u2019t* at least offer to share their umbrella when it\u2019s raining.", "Yeah, I'm responding to 'it's never rude'", "She was rude, he walked away. \nHe returned her exact words, she insulted him. \nShe\u2019s completely TA. \nDo you think you are funny?", "What? I see all people as equals. I agree that she shouldn't be required to talk to him. Just as he shouldn't be required to share with her. SHE established the state of the relationship, which was 'leave me alone'. He listened and went about his night. I'm sorry this upsets you?", "Sorry I didn't read all that. If she stated exactly what OP said, she was rude. Period. There are plenty of other ways to express what she said in a nicer way.  Have a wonderful evening now.", "Huh? It's not hypocritical when his actions are a direct result of her actions...", "[deleted]", "i dont care if they rejected him. whys it matter? theyre a total stranger. how many total strangers have you shared an umbrella with in the middle of the night to walk to a bus stop? how many?", "That's totally fine, I respect all individuals right to their opinion. I just find the duality of these situations interesting.", "OK, let me ask this,  and BTW, the civilized conversation thread, because this situation is fascinating, and it's refreshing to have an actual conversation about these things. If we swapped the genders and she had approached him initially, and he had asked her to use her umbrella, would that change the consensus of the interaction?", "Saying that walking under an umbrella is charity, is quite the  stretch. Someone asking for money is in no way, shape or form analogous to having someone ask to walk next to you, and move your arm 6 inches. Now we're talking apples and oranges.", "How is saying \"I'm not interested\" being an asshole? What would you say instead? \"No, thanks\"? She didn't deserve kindness because she said no to his advances?", "Where does it say anything about cutting him off? He said \"I'm so and so\" to which she replied \"sorry, I'm not interested. \". At what point did she cut him off?", "I'm guessing zero for them as well.", "I share my umbrella all the time, you weirdo. I don\u2019t know how many times \u2014 that\u2019s like asking how many times you\u2019ve given a stranger a tissue or a tampon when they\u2019re in need. It\u2019s just a normal part of life. It\u2019s really strange that you think it\u2019s unusual.", "I've shared an umbrella with strangers dozens to hundreds of times.  In the middle of the night? Probably only a handful of times.  I'm not often out in the middle of the night and haven't relied on bus transit since college.\n\nI carry a full size umbrella when I expect heavy rain.  It virtually guarantees someone will ask or simply step under it with me if I'm walking in from the parking lot.", "Yes, everyone is agreement on that point.", "Why do you think that her telling him she's not interested in talking to him was rude?", "[removed]", "I\u2019m a women lmao and no I haven\u2019t made friends with straight men at clubs because they don\u2019t go there looking for platonic friends , do you live in the real world?", "I'm not sure there IS a consensus of the interaction because there are so many butthurt loser guys on here validating this asshole.", "She cut him off before he even hit on her. She didn\u2019t know if he was going to hit on her but assumed so and brushed him off like he wasn\u2019t a person with feelings. She could very politely say she isn\u2019t interested at the appropriate time. \n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways where you think you deserve basic polite human interaction but aren\u2019t willing to give it to others.", "I interpreted \u201cI went to go start up a conversation, and she straight up said\u201d to mean she cut him off. \n\nBut taking a look at ops history shows a disturbing history of comments about women. \n\nMaybe she was rude, but def enough smoke that there very well could be fire. Take care.", "Obviously. They'll lie tho", "You're out in the middle of the night in the rain with an umbrella heading to the bus stop with people asking you to share your umbrella? All the time?\n\nWhat are you up to out there all the time? What are you up to?", "So....zero. We got it.", "Happy cake day!", "Caught on one point, you pivot to another.", "Why are you asking about my genitals? Lol reported", "You have plenty of other conversations going on by the looks of it crazy person.", "Well, while I agree that overall, it would have been a chivalrous thing for him to do, I really am curious. Does swapping the genders, in your opinion, change the outcome of this situation?"]}
