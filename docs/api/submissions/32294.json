I really don't understand the responses calling you TA. I find it incredibly weird for a stranger to ask to share an umbrella with you.

But you are slightly a dick. To me, that's just funny and deserved though. Good job.", "YTA. Had this woman not rejected you earlier I'm sure you would have shared your umbrella. If you need justification just become a woman isn't interested in being hit on, you have a very fragile ego.", "YTA. I did laugh at your retort to her. But etiquette and 'being nice' (in general) would have you share the umbrella. You did it out of spite for her slightly harsh rejection. And you've now justified her rejection of you as she can (and will) tell her friends about this jerk who came up to hit on her etc.", "Nta, she didn't want to talk to you, you have the same right.", "YTA.

It costs you nothing to be kind and/or helpful.\n\nHow shitty would this world become if everyone reacted in such a way every time they felt disrespected, hurt, rejected, etc!? It's like a disease that spreads. That sounds miserable. On the same note, kindness spreads too. So instead of her being in a bad mood the next day bitching about how she felt treated by you, she might've been in a better mood and not gotten upset at traffic, the person who made her coffee, her job/coworker, etc etc. You didn't just piss her off in the moment. She very likely took what you gave her and spread the 'hate' a little further.\n\nYou're pissed she didn't give you the time of day. Could she have given you a softer rejection? Sure. But she didn't ... at least from your perspective. But you can't put yourself in her shoes. Maybe she'd been having a rough night of asshole dudes coming up to her. Maybe one of them said something that upset her and she spread it onto you. See, it can all come back around. Bigger picture, my friend; bigger picture.", "Maybe that's what she thought about you?
