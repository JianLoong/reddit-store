Such a gross and unnecessary power play. Clearly not a friend worth having.", "In your own words: \"I prefer ***no*** shoes in my house ***normally***, but Paulo always orders me to take my shoes off in his house, and ***I just wanted to order him to do something back for a change***.\"", "Because having people remove their shoes is not only normal but has a function - it keeps the house clean. \n\nI have been to houses where hosts have preferred shoes on, but it's because it's their preference and not because they are being petty.\n\nYTA because you just don't like following other people's house rules and decided to be petty about it.", "Why are you expecting him to wear shoes in the house when you don't?", "Yta. \n\nAt first, I thought no. Your house your rules.  But this comment right here makes you a huge one.", "so, double standard YTA then for sure", "Then you know you\u2019re the asshole. You did it to be mean. That\u2019s an asshole. You did it to be petty. That\u2019s an asshole. You did it to punish him. That\u2019s an asshole. You went contrary to your own established norms. That\u2019s an asshole. YTA.", "YTA. You're throwing a tantrum like a toddler just because he doesn't want your dirty shoes on his carpet.", "So you were on a power-trip. YTA", "by discriminating against your friend", "how bizarre. OP is offended by...not being allowed to disrespect paulo and his house. wear socks if you're so afraid to show people your bare feet you weirdo.", "Oh that\u2019s different- that\u2019s so immature \ud83d\ude44", "Okay now YTA OP, was it worth your friendship with Paulo just to be petty? Maybe it's for the best because it seems like you two don't click. You could've just told Paulo that you were taking your shoes off anyway so there was no need for him to order you to do it.", "Thank you for that update.", "I think it's terrible to tell people how they should dress in your home, even if it's just shoes.   Maybe they have a hole in their sock and they'd be embarrassed.  Who knows.  I want my guests to feel at home and comfortable.   As soon as someone tell me to take my shoes off before entering, I know they value their carpets more than me.", "maybe but there was a lot of N T A votes who were missing info & probably satisfied OP that he was reading N T A", "To be petty as fuck.", "I prefer no shoes in my house normally, but Paulo always orders me to take my shoes off in his house, and I just wanted to order him to do something back for a change", "Why is it a big deal to be asked to take off your shoes when you normally would anyway?  \n\nRegardless, this is something you only did to be petty, YTA.", "Caught you! You're definitely the AH here!", "Yikes. Based on this comment alone, YTA. So, it's not even a rule in your house, you were just being petty? \n\nPaulo deserves a better friend.", "you do realize he does this because it keeps the floors cleaner? he\u2019s not doing it to be bossy. there\u2019s a reason. you\u2019re just doing it to be rude. YTA", "Oh, in that case you are even more of an AH.", "If you don\u2019t wear shoes in your house, why do you want to wear shoes in his?  If you don\u2019t want to wear shoes in his, why does he have to tell you to take them off?  YTA", "This is why YTA.", "He probably just reminds everyone who comes in to take off their shoes because it isn't traditional in some places but he wants to maintain nice floors. It is just a reminder.  Not a power play to lord over you.\n\nYou did this just to be petty and you lost a friend.  You could have just told him that the tone of his reminder was a little harsh and you would prefer a more cordial reminder. \n\nYTA", "I dislike the power imbalance where he orders me to strip down to my bare feet but I never order him to do anything back.", "Paolo just wants to keep his house clean so he asks everyone to take off their shoes. You on the other hand, are making rules specifically for him to order him around because you wanted to go on a powertrip. That makes you the AH. YTA", "What? So basically, it's a power play and you literally ordered him? Wow", "Bro you need help. \"Strip down to my bare feet\" dramatic much?", "he just asks you to take your shoes off, not strip nude and do the macarena. \"power imbalance\" makes no sense and seems stupid. \n\nyou should probably see someone about this bizarre behavior.", "It\u2019s shoes.  Good lord, get a grip.", "That is ridiculous.", "You have a really sensitive ego, don't you?", "So wear socks", "Delusional thinking. Seek therapy", "then don't hang out with him at either of your homes. this is a fucked up dynamic to have with someone who is supposedly your pal.", "If you\u2019re worried about a power imbalance, you are not this person\u2019s friend.", "\"Power imbalance...\" HAHAHAHAHA that's hilarious.\n\nIt's *shoes.*", "Please seek therapy. This is so stupid and petty and hopefully Pablo realizes it and stops being your friend", "You need to grow up. This is so incredibly petty and immature", "Are you 5 years old?", "Power imbalance? It's called don't track dirt from outside onto the floor and rugs!", "LMAO this is so ridiculous. OP you need to calm down.", "So just order him to take off his shoes??", "It's super weird that you keep saying \"strip down\" \n\nOh & YTA", "Wait... He insists you take your socks off, too? I get shoes, because they touch dirt/ground/gross, but how can anyone reasonably demand you to take off your *socks*.  That sounds super weird to me. Sounds like he has a thing for feet. Maybe he is a \"hang out in public\" kind of friend.", "Then the real question here us why are you constantly going sockless?", "What a weird attitude for a friend", "Then do the responsible adult thing and employ open honest direct and respectful communication.", "Are you okay? Wtf \ud83e\udd23", "You are a control freak.  You won\u2019t have Paolo as a friend much longer when it\u2019s more important to exert control than to be friendly, so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it", "He makes you remove socks too? Because that I would say is strange. Hmmm.", "Literally. \n\n \"I'm the boss at my house, you're the boss at yours\" was an actual argument I had with my neighbor WHEN WE WERE FIVE AND SIX. Then we grew up."]}
