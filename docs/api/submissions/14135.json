Youd be doing a good favour for the bride, preventing drama and the wedding from being ruined.", "NTA\u2026.Tell someone ASAP!! The bride will thank you.", "NTA but I would speak to the aunt first, personally. Let her know multiple people disagree with her wearing white and it's not just \"nan being outdated!\". If she's still adamant about wearing white, then tell whoever is the relative of the aunt (which sounds like the groom based on your wording?). It's his family - his responsibility to handle.", "NTA. I would tell the grooms mom what her sister is planning to do, and let her handle it. You already said she would throw hands, so she may be the best one to deal with the situation and get the point across that this aunt should NOT be wearing white on someone else's wedding day. That's super tacky. \n\nYou could also try speaking with the aunt who plans on wearing white directly, and let her know that wearing white on someone else's wedding day is not ok, and that if she insists on wearing white still, that you'll tell the grooms mom, who won't be nearly as nice about it as you are.", "NTA.\n\nYou should definitely do that to prevent a shock on the wedding itself.

The guy was asking if he was TA for pouring wine on the dress of a guest who'd attended a wedding in a white dress. The general consensus was that he wasn't TA and was in fact the hero. I'm not suggesting you do this, but I doubt you'd get in trouble for it and in fact it'd probably go down quite well.\n\nTo advise your actual situation, I don't think you'd be TA but I think there is a better solution. If the bride already has a lot of anxiety surrounding the wedding, adding this absolute boulder of a problem will not help. You are related to the other spouse (I'm assuming groom but regardless, you get my jist). You should inform them and just have the aunt removed from the guest list. It's subtle, it avoids further anxiety, and it keeps the problem in a small circle", "YWNBTA because there was no reason for them to even talk about all of that if they weren't aware it was the wrong thing for your aunt to be doing. They all know it's not kind to not tell the bride.", "NTA\n\nTell her.

With the potential impact it could have on the wedding I would seriously consider saying something just so conflict can be avoided on the day.", "YWNBTA. Tell the bride when she has time (not at the hen or something like that). \n\nMaybe start with 'you are not sure, is there any dress code for they wedding? Like ... or no white dresses'. If she says no, no dress code (even after you mention white dresses, there would be no need to ask or tell anything more. but if she says obvious no white dresses. You can tell her, that you heard abaut your aunt who wants to wear white so you wanted to give her a heads up. Maybe so she can write a dress code out to everyone or to ask her fiancy, MOH or someone else to tell the aunt, she can't wear white.", "YWNBTA. I would suggest first trying to resolve the issue without directly telling the bride to not worry her if there is still time - so talk to your aunt again first and if that does not work to the mother of the bride (and ask her not to tell the bride). If all that also does not work then you should definitley tell the bride.", "Your aunt is mistaken and someone needs to tell her so. It's still inappropriate to wear white to someone else's wedding in 2023. Please be sure someone talks to your aunt, and tell the bride BEFORE her hen do so she can get someone to intervene.

You say the bride has anxiety issues, and take that into consideration, but honestly, this is not the end of the world. Don't approach this in an ominous way, or something that leads her to believe it's on the level that someone died.

I think the bride has planned basically everything herself and hasn't necessarily used a brides maid in the traditional sense. I'll have to find out incase I'm wrong.
