The bride will thank you.", "NTA but I would speak to the aunt first, personally. Let her know multiple people disagree with her wearing white and it's not just \"nan being outdated!\". If she's still adamant about wearing white, then tell whoever is the relative of the aunt (which sounds like the groom based on your wording?). It's his family - his responsibility to handle.", "NTA. I would tell the grooms mom what her sister is planning to do, and let her handle it.

I'm not suggesting you do this, but I doubt you'd get in trouble for it and in fact it'd probably go down quite well.\n\nTo advise your actual situation, I don't think you'd be TA but I think there is a better solution. If the bride already has a lot of anxiety surrounding the wedding, adding this absolute boulder of a problem will not help.

You can tell her, that you heard abaut your aunt who wants to wear white so you wanted to give her a heads up.

I would suggest first trying to resolve the issue without directly telling the bride to not worry her if there is still time - so talk to your aunt again first and if that does not work to the mother of the bride (and ask her not to tell the bride). If all that also does not work then you should definitley tell the bride.", "Your aunt is mistaken and someone needs to tell her so.
