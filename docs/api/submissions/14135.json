The bride will thank you.", "NTA but I would speak to the aunt first, personally. Let her know multiple people disagree with her wearing white and it's not just \"nan being outdated!\". If she's still adamant about wearing white, then tell whoever is the relative of the aunt (which sounds like the groom based on your wording?). It's his family - his responsibility to handle.", "NTA. I would tell the grooms mom what her sister is planning to do, and let her handle it.

I'm not suggesting you do this, but I doubt you'd get in trouble for it and in fact it'd probably go down quite well.\n\nTo advise your actual situation, I don't think you'd be TA but I think there is a better solution. If the bride already has a lot of anxiety surrounding the wedding, adding this absolute boulder of a problem will not help.

You can tell her, that you heard abaut your aunt who wants to wear white so you wanted to give her a heads up.

I would suggest first trying to resolve the issue without directly telling the bride to not worry her if there is still time - so talk to your aunt again first and if that does not work to the mother of the bride (and ask her not to tell the bride). If all that also does not work then you should definitley tell the bride.", "Your aunt is mistaken and someone needs to tell her so.

As long as you not let your aunt ruin the wedding, YNTA", "If I was the bride, I would be very happy to get this information. Immediately, this aunt will be banned from the wedding and future gatherings. It's obvious this aunt wants attention and is dragging everyone with her toxic behavior. \nYou would not be, but YWBTA if you didn't do anything to prevent this. All this costly event was ruined by one person who does not respect anyone.", "NTA. You need to tell the bride and also your cousin. Let him back up his future wife", "This!", "I'd bring it to the groom's attention before the bridesmaids/maid of honor. Maybe he can talk some sense into his mother.", "Or, the aunt will go through with it and when bride finds out OP knew she'd be mad at OP for hiding it. \nHonestly, which scenerios seems more like to happen?", "This is the grooms mom who is wearing the white dress. This is a start to some just no MIL type things here.", "Right? Why are we putting this all on the bride?!?! Contact the cousin (groom) and tell him to get his mom under control. \n\nAlso, if you know about it, call aunt yourself and tell her she is going to make a fool of herself, or secretly spread it to the whole family and shame her, \"I heard auntie is going to wear a white gown to cousin's wedding, how desperate does that look?\"", "Yeah I meant it because I think they would be a (well intentioned) AH if they told the bride without exhausting all other possible options first", "Okay, so this is not the groom's mother bringing the drama.  Oh, just go ahead and tell his mother since she'll handle it for you all.  It still avoids telling the bride and keeps the drama in the family.  Let her throw those hands for her soon-to-be DIL.", ">My aunt in particular likes to stir drama and her sister (the grooms mother) would throw hands if she found out\n\n...I mean the groom's mother is going to find out at the wedding, so wouldn't it be better to tell her in advance and let her fight it out with her sister before then? So that the bride and groom don't have their day ruined?", "Better to have the hands thrown before the wedding and let the un-invites go out and the dust settle than to have the hands thrown at the event, especially if the poor bride is blindsided by it.\n\nIf you don't feel close enough to the bride, telling her close confidantes is acceptable.  But she needs to know early enough that she and her future spouse can decide if they need to do things like adjusting the seating plan or telling people to stay home and hiring security.", "And that is **exactly** what will happen on the day if you don't say anything and Aunt shows up in white. That'll DEFINITELY ruin the day! \n\nSo if there's going to be fisticuffs, better make sure it happens before the big day!!!", "Then it would be better if that didn't happen at your cousin's wedding reception...", "\"What do you mean the engine seized because it ran out of oil?\"", "Two scenarios play out:   \n\n\nWedding day comes and the aunt wears something totally different because someone with reason convinces her it's in poor taste. She wears something more appropriate.   \n\n\nor  \n\n\nWedding day comes and the aunt shows up in white. Some guests will look at her with disdain, some may comment negatively to her face, some may not say anything at all just to be polite. The bottom line is the bride will notice, but she will be so pre-occupied with her preparations, photos, first dance with groom, possibly with dad, more photos, eat, mingling with guests, dancing... etc. She'll be too busy enjoying her wedding day to focus on her idiot aunt. But she will never forget the disrespect she showed her.    \n\n\nThe bottom line is the wedding hasn't happened yet. Apparently she's already stressed. Why stress her out more anticipating something that may not happen?   \n\n\nHow would I feel? I had my day. A good chunk of what could go wrong did go wrong. I made myself a promise before even planning my wedding that I wouldn't allow anything or anyone to ruin my mood or our day. I didn't. In fact, my step mother delayed the wedding by a half hour, my niece tore a good chunk of the front of my dress moments before I was to walk down the aisle and I had no time to do anything about it. My husband accidentally set my veil on fire hahahaha it was freaking hilarious. You roll with the punches.", "It's not the groom's mother, it's the groom and OP's aunt.", "Call your cousin right now and tell him his mom is planning to cause drama at his wedding. He\u2019s the person whose job it is to handle this.", ">Walk around with a glass of red wine (or whatever) at the beginning of the wedding, and then, accidently bump into your aunt.  \n>  \n>No need to tell the bride.  \n>  \n>Problem solved.  \n>  \n>NTA", "If you're going to the Hen's night then her close friends will be there. Even if none of them are acting as her MOH or bridesmaids in the traditional sense they're still probably the best people to talk to to figure out a solution (whether that's telling her, telling the groom, or just being ready to go with the red wine route).\n\nThe other option is to tell the groom.", "Tell the groom.", "Tell your cousin. Especially if it\u2019s his mother. He will know what to do, and can also enlist the bridal party (bridesmaids and groomsmen) to take action.", "Agreed!", "It's not his mother. It's their aunt.", "I wouldn't be able to keep my mouth shut. I would warn the aunt that I'm bringing red wine and if she wears that dress, she's gonna wear the wine too.", "Still better a 'punch up' before the wedding than on the wedding day itself."]}
