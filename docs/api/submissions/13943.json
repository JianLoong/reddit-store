We are just very different people who chose very different lives and because of the age difference we weren't close growing up. We live about four hours apart and maybe see each other in person once every 2-3 years and talk a handful of times a year.\n\nSo I was very surprised when my niece (16f) called me out of the blue to tell me that she was in the town I live closest to and wanted to know if she could stay a while. I figured she was having some teenager moments with her family and drove into town to grab her. \n\nWhen we got home, I called and then texted my sister and told her that niece was with me. I just got a \"K\" response which furthered my suspicion that they had a fight. \n\nShe had been here for about three weeks and things were going okay. I'm not used to having kids around but she was a teenager and didn't need supervision. She seemed to be pretty quiet and withdrawn but I don't know this girl so it's not like I have any idea what she is like normally.\n\nWell a few days ago, we were having dinner and she told me that she was pregnant. Her parents had kicked her out. She wanted to keep the baby and her parents disagreed with her, to put it mildly. \n\nI told her that under no circumstances would I live in the same house as a newborn and even if I wanted to, we live too far out of town and she didn't drive so logistically it would have been a nightmare. We argued but I told her she was going to back to my sisters.\n\nI called my sister and we argued, quite heatedly but I told her I was putting her back on the bus the next day and she better pick her up or I was going to call CPS. \n\nMy niece has been back with my sister for a couple days and the entire family is pissed at me of all people. My niece is especially mad and has texted me a few times to tell me how much she hates it at her family's house and that I'm cruel.\n\nEdited to add - I did try to go over different options with my niece, but that was what lead to us arguing. She only wanted to stay here and have the baby but I told her that wasn't an option.", "created_utc": 1680571974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12b54uo/aita_for_making_my_niece_leave_when_i_learned_she/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does her state have any educational or training programs (somed do) or other resources?   If her home situation is abusive, does she need to consider emancipation?   \n\nYes, even for a teen mom there are options to be discussed.  And whether you agree with her mistake in getting pregnant or not, she is a living human being who deserves some basic empathy, not to be treated like a hot potato.", "Maybe make an effort to at least get to know her. She\u2019s obviously very desperate for some support if she thought living with a near-stranger was a better alternative than going home.", "I'm guessing you have plenty of reasons for avoiding that side of your family.. The more I find out, the more I'm wondering what kind of upbringing that poor niece of yours had.. You maybe should make that CPS phone call after all?", "You should have put that info in your post.", "[deleted]", "Edit this into the post, other users are going to wrongly assume that you made no effort to communicate with your niece.\n\nAlso, niece's parents are right that niece needs to sort out an abortion ASAP because having a baby to rebel against her parents is an awful idea.", "Talk about burying the lede.  That's not in your original post.", "That\u2019s a shame. Being an aunt is a blessing.", "Finding local organisations that help young girls in these situations rather than sending her back to parents who kicked their own child onto the streets thinking that was somehow a solution to pregnancy? I\u2019m not saying that OP was TA I\u2019m just pointing out a different opinion that may have been better for the niece.", "The girl has zero support. Mom illegally kicked her out, and aunt didn\u2019t even bother calling cps. Literally sent her back to what is most likely going to be an abusive household. \n\nNot disagreeing with your point on niece making plans to live with aunt, but everyone is failing this girl.", "I\u2019ve been very clear in every one of my comments that it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility. The responsibility for her niece falls solely on her niece\u2019s ~~mother~~ parents. Clearly if she kicked out her own minor child, OP\u2019s sister is not a safe parent and OP has an obligation to report her sister to CPS for child abandonment.", "I\u2019m not advocating for this or anything \u2026 but the girl\u2019s mom could avoid supporting her daughter at all and make it clear she has CPS on speed-dial. Report her daughter for every missed doctor\u2019s appt for example (and don\u2019t take her to any), and have them open up a case before the kid is even born. It depends how far the teen\u2019s mom is willing to go, but if she\u2019s willing to go Krakatoa-meets-Zeus-meets-Noah\u2019s-Arc scorched earth she can absolutely manage the situation to have that baby taken away at birth.", "Okay, troll.", "Ew gross", "Not sure why we\u2019re all getting down voted for being concerned about a teen in crisis", "All those options need to be discussed with the people who are her legal guardians.", "I really would prefer not to. My sister and her whole family come with a lot of drama. And there's a reason my husband and I live rurally.", "That might be a good idea. I don't think my sister would be abusive, but I think she is probably pretty strict with her kids.", "Sorry I was trying not to make this a novel. I'll add it. Thank you.", "Agreed", "I did add that to my post. Thank you. I was trying not to make this a novel.", "I did. Thank you. That was another reason I wanted her to go home, by the way. She would be closer to abortion/women's care.", "Thats up to the niece to decide if she wants one or not. Forcing her to get one is wrong", "Lol who is downvoting the fact that being an aunt is one of the greatest gifts in the world? What is wrong with you people? Lol. Go love your nieces and nephews!", "Given that her niece wanted to stay with OP and have the baby there, any help some organization could give wouldn\u2019t be enough.", "The aunt who barely knows her sent her back to her parents, the people who should be taking care of her. OP didn\u2019t fail her.", "If OP's sister isn't supposed to kick the neice out because she's a minor, what is Sister supposed to do about this baby coming that she has no capacity to support?", "That\u2019s\u2026really fucked up. The girl clearly WANTS to parent and needs guidance, not..whatever this is.", "I think that would cause a lot more problems. \nI've made a post about this before that received a lot of hate but basically:\n\nWe can't give teens reproductive rights with no reproductive responsibility. If the parents have to keep the teen no matter what, then the parents should have the right to force and abortion or adoption. I don't agree with that. That's why I side with parents beimg able to kick their pregnant teen (or impregnating son) out when they have kids. \n\nThe only other possibility maybe is to put the pregnant teen up for adoption?", "Yeah this is straight up wacky, lol. I worked in child welfare for 8 years and saw all kinds of sad shit that happened to teen moms and their babies.", "Fr she has nobody in her life being the least bit supporting downvotes crazy fs", "Jesus, this poor girl would be better off in foster care.", "[deleted]", "YTA for this.\n\nYou don't even care about the poor girl.", "Kicking out your child like this is abusive.", "Your sister kicked out her 16-year-old daughter. We already know she's abusive, so you're clearly giving her *far* too much credit.", "I might be reading too far into this, but you have a pregnant teenage girl, everyone seems to be very vague about how that happened and she has absolutely no game plan or life skills at 16.. Not all abuse is violence and this is reading like some sort of abuse to me", "Your sister broke the law by kicking out her 16 year old daughter (abandonment), and while there may not be physical abuse from what we know, it sounds like there is emotional abuse and emotional neglect. My sister is still in therapy after going to rehab for PTSD related to these. And I\u2019m not doing much better. Call CPS. Please. That\u2019s all you\u2019d have to do.", "[deleted]", "The niece\u2019s parents gave her the \u201chelp\u201d of throwing their 16 year old out of the house. I don\u2019t know how far along in her pregnancy she is but her parents have wilfully ignored giving her the medical care that she needs (prenatal care is important for grown women, this girl is growing a baby and still growing herself) I\u2019m sure that there are organisations that will give her more help than her parents have.", "Figure it out. We dont know any details about OP\u2019s sister\u2019s home life or financial situation to make a judgement on what she should do. But when you choose to bring a child into this world, YOU are responsible for that child every day until they become a legal adult. You don\u2019t get to pick and choose when to be responsible for them just because you disagree with a decision they made.", "I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s possible. They obviously don\u2019t want the baby there, and it would be simple enough to arrange a situation where the child would be taken away if that\u2019s what they chose to do.", "You realize you can\u2019t just \u201cput a child up for adoption\u201d at any age, right? There\u2019s a whole court process that takes months or years, even just to voluntarily relinquish parental rights. Any parent who calls up a state DHHS office and says \u201cI want to give up my teenager right now\u201d is going to prompt an investigation.", "\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39throwing the word \u201cabused\u201d around like that despite there being zero evidence is so harmful to victims this isn\u2019t as woke as you think it is. \n\nYou do not know the financial situation of the mother and whether she can afford to take care of a newborn but daughter doesn\u2019t care because she\u2019s still in high school means meaning the responsibility of her newborn falls onto her mother which she did not sign up for!\n\nBoth her and her mother are TA but none of that shit is OPs responsibility.", "Well because I don't really know her honestly.", "I suspect that there is so much family backstory here", "Yes I did. I told her I didn't want to share a home with a newborn and that she wouldn't have access to health/prenatal care when I live.", "OK, so if the sister is responsible for everything for the niece then can the sister make the decision about abortion or adoption? \n\nNO! That's the right of the neice and thus her responsibility too. \n\nWe can't expect Sister to shoulder this enormous bad decision neice is making. And neice isn't entitled to raise her kid under her parents roof.", "Honestly it\u2019s going to raise red flags to CPS If a pregnant teen\u2019s own parent is reporting her for every tiny little thing. We have no reason to believe that the niece would refuse prenatal care. She probably has no idea when she\u2019s even supposed to go at this point. We also don\u2019t know how far along she is, and most OB offices won\u2019t see you until at least 8 weeks. Plus she doesn\u2019t know anything about her health insurance, some states require parental consent for doctors to see minors, etc.", "Oh. No, I'm not familiar with putting an older child up for adoption. I know it's quite easy for babies but not sure about process for older kids or where that line is drawn.", "You can still feel compassion for a stranger.", "[deleted]", "Lol okay but the solution isn\u2019t for OP\u2019s sister to abandon her own daughter. Whether you think she\u2019s justified or not, it is illegal.", "That\u2019s the thing: they could arrange it so it\u2019s not them doing the reporting. The OB\u2019s office, her pediatrician\u2019s office, her school, the police \u2014 all mandatory reporters. The parents give troubling info to THEM, and THEY report. Then you have a preexisting multi-pronged CPS report from licensed professionals, and the parent reports are just the cherry on top.\n\nI\u2019ve seen this done with APS and it\u2019s lit a fire under their investigations, I have no reason to believe CPS operates any differently.", "You can feel compassion for a stranger without inviting a newborn and their single mother into your home, paying for everything, for an indefinite amount of time.", "No kidding! Christ, OP doesn\u2019t have any obligation to house or financially support the girl, but at least talk to her and give her some kind of emotional support. She\u2019s obviously very desperate if she\u2019s reaching out to family members that she barely knows to ask for help.", "You're right. Sister should give neice up for adoption. Sister doesn't have to care for a baby. Neice gets to keep her baby. Perfectly legal transfer of custody to the state. \n\nEveryone wins!", "\u2026okay, but why? What has the niece done to make you think this is necessary?", "She didn't reach out for help though. She lived there for three weeks before divulging that she was pregnant. The sister didn't even mention it in those three weeks either. Not only that but OP did the right thing by recognizing that her niece would not be able to get the care that she needs. Called her parents immediately and said she would call CPS if they don't take their daughter back which is 100% the correct response.\n\nHad the niece said up front that she was pregnant and wanted to move in with OP and OP said no would she be an asshole then?", "I mean\u2026people do it all the time. I used to manage a protective custody shelter for years and we had at least one pregnant teenager in there at any given time due to being kicked out by parents. The state would court-order all kinds of family support services for the girl and her parents, like therapy, medical care, parenting classes, etc. They\u2019d go into foster care, have their baby and eventually age out if they didn\u2019t reunify with the parents.", "It\u2019s not what I would do lol, I\u2019m just saying that if the teen\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t want a baby under her roof \u2014there are ways to easily arrange it so that child will never be under her roof.", "She was probably scared to say it, or assumed that her parents already told OP. She definitely should have been up front about it, but she\u2019s a child in a very scary and vulnerable situation. Her mother should have told OP right when she took her in. \n\nOP isn\u2019t an asshole for not wanting to take the girl in herself. OP is an asshole for not doing the right thing to get her help. She needs to call CPS regardless, not just make empty threats to scare her sister into taking the kid back."]}
