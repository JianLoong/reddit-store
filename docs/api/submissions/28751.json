He imposes his diet on his family and his rules are excessive: no frozen food, no meal preps, no fried/slow cooked food, no processed food. \n\nThere was a time he would eat 4 to 5 pounds of meat and a dozen of eggs a week when he was going to the gym. Ha was also obsessed with proteins to the point that he didn't have enough money because of all the supplements he bought. When we went to restaurants, he'd complain that there was not enough proteins. He later became a paramedic and started eating normally. \n\nHe seems to love his job and has become interested in health. Two years ago, he enrolled at a nutrition training that is not approved by the government then the issues started. My s.o and I noticed that the training center was lead by anti-vaxs and anti-abortions. Their brochure claimed that mainstream science is not accurate and so on.\n\nWhen he cooks, he uses a thermometer, a scale, and a timer for EACH INGREDIENT not to follow a specific recipe but to comply with one of his study books and the cooking of sauteed vegetables can last up to 4 hours. He forbids his wife and kids to eat dairy and gluten while they are not known to be intolerant. His wife works from 7 am to 7 pm and is tired of following the diet, tired of him assessing all the labels on the groceries she brings. They recently had an argument because she put 20g too many in their toddler's meal. \n\nMy in-laws reported this to us saying that he is abusing their daughter and grandkids, that he is mean. So I suggested that maybe he needed therapy because it is obvious that he went from bigorexia to orthorexia. \n\nMy FIL then yelled \"No no you can't say that my daughter is married to a crazy guy\".  I told him, it had nothing to do with craziness, it can be reversed. He insisted \"no one says my daughter is married to crazy! no one!\". My MIL was sobbing.

All these elders thinking that if you have a disorder, you're automatically \"crazy\".\n\nNTA, but I would honestly stay very away from all this drama. If your in-laws say something again, change the subject or just go with \"oh, that's tough\".", "NTA, he has an eating disorder and control issues.", "NTA. His eating habits are needlessly strict (weird for him, and way too controlling for the rest of his family).", "NTA He clearly has an eating disorder, and he's abusive as well. I feel so bad for their poor children.", "Tvis is very obviously an uncontrolled need for control related to food. If it isn't an eating disorder, it is OCD I'd guess. Not a real diagnosis, obviously. \n\nNTA. They need to hear that something is wrong and the response should be help, not blame and freaking out over \"married to crazy\".", "Is your FIL Frank Costanza? Serenity now!\n\nSeriously though, NTA. This guy is imposing his out there way of eating on someone who isn't happy about it and it's impacting his family in a negative way. You shouldn't diagnose him, but he does need to maybe seek some help. Good luck though if he's anti reason per some things you've said. It's true that his wife needs to speak up, but this also sounds like abuse.", "NTA, ask your in-laws why they'd rather have their daughter married to an abuser than to a man with a manageable disorder.", "NTA. You're probably right. Your Dad is just embedded DEEP in the concept that any kind of mental abnormality is \"crazy and bad and must be shunned and hated\", and frankly, that's upsetting. SIL's husband is not the only asshole here, I'm sorry.", "NTA - so they were happy to accept that he is mean and abusive but draw the line at suggesting that he has a mental disorder?", "So it's fine to call him abusive (he is), but it's not ok to say he has a disorder (he does)? These people need to sort out their priorities. Honestly, their reaction is such a bizarre/irrational example of wounded pride. \n\nNTA at all. Going forward, talk to your spouse about offering your SIL a safe (judgement free) space to talk about what she's going through, how to seek treatment for the husband, or make an escape plan if he refuses. Judging by her parents' reaction, they're not capable of being that support right now.", "More information is needed but based on what's provided ESH. They were talking about how they believe the FIL is abusive. You were saying he has an eating disorder. While their reaction is dumb (regarding mental illness) I could see being upset because you essentially ignored their concerns.\n\nThe guy needs help. But is his forcing his behavior on his family causing them stress, anxiety, nutritional problems, or is it just inconvenient? Basically, does this guy need help to see his issues or does his wife and child need help to be removed from the situation? \n\nYou are in no way an AH for saying he has an eating disorder. You could be one for missing the bigger picture of abuse. But on the flip, someone who abuses their family clearly also has some type of mental illness, so your in-laws definitely suck.", "NTA. your FIL doesn't want to accept the reality. He didn't say his son in-law is not crazy, he said \"no one says my daughter is married to crazy! no one!\". \n\nThe signs are in the brochure: \"mainstream science is not accurate\". Really?", "NAH.  He has some issues.  But the emotional reaction of not criticizing him isn\u2019t being an ass either.", "Boomers: Look at what this person is doing, it's unfair/abusive/mean/horrible!! \n\nNormal human: Maybe mental illness? \n\nBoomers: No, not like that! Our generation never had mental health issues! Don't use that as an excuse for shitty behavior!! \n\nSigh. I don't understand why that generation is so resistant to admitting mental illness is a real thing. It definitely sounds like your BIL is not only practicing unhealthy and unsafe eating practices, but he is inflicting it on wife and kids too. He could very well in fact have developed an ED. If nothing changes, there is a good chance that those kids are going to grow up with disordered eating habits.\n\nNTA for suggesting it, your IL's are AH for not admitting to themselves what they are mad about but don't want to believe.", "ESH . Mostly you.\n\n\nHe was talking about how his daughter/grandkids are basically being abused, and your response was \"maybe he needs therapy\".\n\n\n\nHe is mean. He is an abuser. Maybe, with help and therapy he can get better, but an eating disorder doesn't excuse this behavior, and you're writing it off as not his fault, and that it's just a mental health issue. He's absolutely an abuser and forcing these rules on his family. You completely ignored that part of FILs comment and it was \"how can we help the abuser\"?", "Nta - but maybe a different plan.", "NTA he has an unhealthy relationship with food but the parents/in laws are also strange for their reactions", "YTA.

So it\u2019s cool for the in-laws to think he\u2019s abusive, but a mental disorder is way out of line?", "He's a control freak who is making the lives of his wife and kids. His wife needs support from the family, and very likely help getting away from that nutter.", "So, they'd rather their grandchildren starved to death, than say their son-in-law has mental issues? I'd suggest calling Child Protective Services. And stop talking about it to your in-laws, FIL has his own mental block.", "It's bizarre how many people go along with their spouse \"forbidding\" something, whether food or anything else.\n\nYour diet is your issue. Don't make it mine.", "Seriously bizarre. \n\nObviously crazy is a reductive term but whether OP \u201cdiagnoses\u201d it or not, there\u2019s something seriously wrong with the way this guy operates.

He\u2019s upset about the fact that his son in law is oppressing his family with his nutty dietary choices but what he will absolutely not tolerate is others calling him crazy. That\u2019s were he draws the line.", "I was thinking the same! Sounds very much like my mother, who has diagnosed OCD and orthorexia. Especially if dude is experiencing distress about not following his meal plan. I've lost count of how many times my mother straight-up cried because someone took more food than her serving size. Not even a lot of food! Just, like, 3 or 4 green beans extra could send her spiralling. \n\nI agree, NTA. The BIL needs a healthy relationship with food, whether it's OCD or an eating disorder. It will affect his kids even if it's not apparent right now. It took me and my brother years to develop normal relationships to food. I'd hate for his kids to develop lifelong feeding issues over an extra 20g of food here or there.", "I subconsciously read that part in his voice and didn\u2019t realize/remember who \u201cit\u201d was until I read your comment.", "If the abuse is coming from a mental disorder or mental illness, then helping the abuser helps the abused.", "Abuse of children is everyone's business.", "Hahahahaha!!!!!!
