They know that I've altered things and switched things about just for them. They know that I've spent hours and hours and hours over whatever I've made.

It just makes it that much more special to receive gifts from them knowing they worked hard to make that for me.\n\nI had my grandmother on my dads side make me a huge blanket for when I was born.

I also knit some of her sweaters.  Those sweaters are still treasured by her and she wants her kids to wear them. \n\nWhen she had her own children, she insisted I make blankets for them both.

(My dad and my uncles were all engineers, so creative problem solving was encouraged. So was amusing myself and not bothering the grownups)\n\nIt also seemed really unhealthy to me to see kids throw a fit because something wasn't working the way they wanted, and they would have a melt down because they had zero problem solving skills. \n\nThere's an attitude that making things is what poor people do, anything \"homemade\" is tacky and less than, and being resourceful and creative is to be looked down on. If you're financially well off, then you BUY things, or pay other people to make them for you. You also don't DO things yourself, you pay other people to DO things. \n\n. There's a huge cognitive dissonance, \"homemade\" is tacky, but buying \"handmade, artisanal\" is a sign of wealth/prosperity.  \n\nThere were parents that were horrified that  their kids came over to play, and they MADE things, and wouldn't let their kids play with my kids again. Or, they acted like it was nice that I was free day care, but they didn't want those tacky things (that their children made and we're proud of) in their house.

I figured it was some weird Houston  middle class/wanna be upper class thing. (I moved there as an adult)\n\nI'm making an assumption here, but were your grandparents  poor and resourceful?

The writier was livid at the DIL, Prudey ripped her a new one. I'll find it for you.\n\n>My daughter-in-law enjoys knitting and crocheting. For her birthday, my husband and I gave her a generous gift card to a local yarn store, for which she thanked us and seemed very pleased. Imagine my dismay, however, when six months later for our anniversary she gifted us with a lovely bedspread, which she told me she made with yarn purchased from the gift card! I told my son that we\u2019d in effect paid for our own present and that he needs to communicate to his wife how improper and stingy this move was. He refuses, saying that her labor and time were also part of the gift. We haven\u2019t spoken much since except to discuss our grandchildren, and our DIL has been outright cold. I\u2019m considering writing her a letter directly explaining why this was an improper gift and expressing my sadness that her own parents didn\u2019t teach her gift etiquette. My husband wants me to drop the whole thing and pretend like it never happened. Prudie, I don\u2019t like the idea of moving on as if nothing happened.\n\u2014The Gift We Gave Ourselves\n\nhttps://slate.com/human-interest/2018/11/dear-prudence-violent-brother-host.html", "I\u2019m in the process of writing a letter to one of my parents to get them to leave me the hell alone.

They choose not to acknowledge their role in everything and keep bothering me, thus the letter.

She used to do that shit all the time lol she never bought enough yarn for the project. Well, she never had a project in mind when she bought the yarn, I should say. In fact most of the stuff she made is not the same yarn by the end of the blanket or whatever. Lol I miss her sm", "I truly hope that would backfire on her anyway. I loved the things my grandmother knitted for me when I was a child as it showed the time and effort she was prepared to put into making things for us.
