Their dad abandoned the family and left my wife's mom with a large pile of debt that weighed on them. So their life wasn't easy. My MIL often made her kids clothes vs buying them because it was cheaper for her to do (she worked in a store that had a lot of fabrics that they were allowed to take the excess of). She's talented and always put an effort into making sure the clothes looked good enough so the kids wouldn't be bullied. Those clothes are something my wife treasures. She remembers how much love and effort went into them. She also appreciates that her mom tried to make them work enough to blend in at school.

One of the outfits was even his take home outfit. But then a couple of days after our son was born she comes over with a bag of clothes she bought saying she wanted him to have more. My wife and I were shocked. I could see she was upset and looked almost guilty so when my wife went to nap I asked her what was going on. At first she said nothing and she just wanted her grandson to have more. But then she apologized for embarrassing us. I asked her what she meant.\n\nShe told me my parents had talked to her after the baby shower and told her she had left all the grandparent spoiling to them, that she should understand if we never put our son in any of the clothes because really, they look like the kind of home made clothes from 70+ years ago when people were left with no choice. They accused her of not caring enough. I told her I was so sorry they had said that. I assured her I had never said anything like that to them. That my parents had no idea what it was like to have nothing and were being judgmental assholes.

The reason I might be the asshole is I know returning or rejecting a gift can be seen as rude and this could be the case of two wrongs not making a right.

Your parents are absolutely disgusting.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want people like that anywhere near me or my child.

It might have been a bit dramatic to give all of the clothes your parents gave back to them but I can absolutely understand why you did it.", "We talk all the time here about \"what you really have here is a spouse problem.\" THIS is textbook how not to be a problem spouse. You stood up to your side of the family, in defense of your partner and her side of the family. No one had to argue for you to do it, and you didn't angst over how unfair it is to harm your relationship with your parents just because they were jerks. No you saw the harm done and took accountability for rectifying it and ensuring it won't happen again. Bravo. Congratulations on your bundle of joy, and congratulations to your wife on choosing the right person to spend her life with. Your folks are assholes, but you're hella NTA. Your MIL sounds awesome. I would be so honored to get baby clothes made by a grandparent's own hand. I can't believe she was made to feel badly about such a precious and thoughtful gift. Those are heirlooms. One day you'll be grey and showing off those clothes to your adult kid and regaling them with stories about what a big hearted lady your MIL was, how much she loved her children and grandchildren, and what a strong person she was.", "NTA. I'm one of these people who makes things for gifts rather than buys them. Most people love it. They know that every centimetre of the wool I've knitted with has been touched with my love as I've made it. They know I've taken time choosing styles, colours and patterns that I think they'll like. They know that I've altered things and switched things about just for them. They know that I've spent hours and hours and hours over whatever I've made. They know it's a different kind of gift than one that is complete by throwing something in your trolley at the supermarket or clicking add to basket on your phone.\n\nSome people don't get it. It's simple, they don't get another opportunity to learn. I won't make anything else for them. Sod them. If they think fashion or price is more important than time and love, I feel sorry for them.\n\nWhat you did has impressed me and I'm not easily impressed. You saw the true value of your MIL's gift and the love behind it and you showed that to your parents. Respect.", "NTA\n\nThis is, frankly, a pretty tempered reaction.

Your parents went behind your back and put words in your mom potentially jeopardizing your relationship with your mother and law as well as your wife if what they said came to light. You are married with a child, decisions on gifts you accept for your child is between you and your wife only. Your parents on both sides of the aisle can give opinions but they need to understand you and your wife take the lead on these things and since you never said you had a problem with the gifts, in fact you said you appreciated the effort that went into them, they majorly overstepped. \n\nSidenote, good on you for calling out your parents.

I'm not suggesting you weaponize access to the grandchild, but the level of spoiling  is *absolutely* within your purview as a parent to control.
