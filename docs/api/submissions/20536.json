They know that I've altered things and switched things about just for them. They know that I've spent hours and hours and hours over whatever I've made.

It just makes it that much more special to receive gifts from them knowing they worked hard to make that for me.\n\nI had my grandmother on my dads side make me a huge blanket for when I was born.

I also knit some of her sweaters.  Those sweaters are still treasured by her and she wants her kids to wear them. \n\nWhen she had her own children, she insisted I make blankets for them both.
