{"id": 15132, "submission_id": "12r0sys", "title": "AITA for being angry that I wasn't asked to be in the wedding party?", "selftext": "One of my (28F) best friends, Mark (28M), just got engaged and he and his fianc\u00e9e are planning to get married next Spring. For context, Mark and I have been good friends since high school. My boyfriend (28M) has also really bonded with Mark over the past two years of us dating, and they regularly go golfing together. We have also done lots of couples' vacations/dates/outings together and were seemingly very close to Mark and his fianc\u00e9e. My boyfriend and I just recently went to their house for a party, and Mark and his fianc\u00e9e asked my boyfriend (whom they know through me, and only for a couple of years) to be in the wedding party as a groomsman. I was not asked to be a bridesmaid, so I would not be involved in the wedding party at all. When I asked Mark about this, he said it was because they wanted even numbers (5 groomsmen and 5 bridesmaids) for the wedding party, and that his fianc\u00e9e already had enough bridesmaids.\n\nI thought for sure I would be asked to be in their wedding as a bridesmaid, seeing as they were my good friends and I would have 100% included them in my wedding party if I ever got married. So not only was I not asked to be in their wedding party, but my boyfriend, whom they'd known for all of two seconds, was. I felt very hurt that they would ask him to be a part of their big day but not me. I confronted Mark about how hurt/sad/angry I was about this, especially because I don't know if my boyfriend and I will even still be together a year from now. Mark told me that he was sorry that my feelings were hurt, but he and his fianc\u00e9e don't want to apologize for doing what they want with their wedding. Mark told me that this situation has impacted our friendship, especially since he doesn't think they have anything to apologize for. My boyfriend declined to be a groomsman and we haven't spoken to Mark since. AITA?\n\nEDIT - Just to clarify, I never **expected** to be asked to be in their wedding. Of course I would love to be in their wedding party because they are my friends (I have been friends with Mark since I was 16 and friends with Alisa (Mark's fiancee) for going on 8 years now) and I would love to celebrate their love and happiness, but I never ever demanded it. If they never would have asked either of us to be in the wedding, I would have been totally fine with that. It's that they asked everyone else in our friend group to be in it, including my boyfriend. Everyone except me. When Alisa (Mark's fiancee) talked to me about it, she said the only reason she didn't ask me to be in the wedding was because of the matching wedding party numbers, which was disappointing and hurt. I totally understand that it is their wedding and they should do what they like, but I also hoped they wouldn't exclude me like that because of wedding party numbers. I know everyone says to not make it about me - but what do you do in that situation? Not say anything at all? I just felt a little blindsided. Maybe Mark and I weren't as close as we thought. Perhaps it's all for the best.", "created_utc": 1681845297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r0sys/aita_for_being_angry_that_i_wasnt_asked_to_be_in/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Groom has been socializing solo with your bf for two years (which you change to \"all of two seconds\" at the end of your story) and selected him as a groomsman.

On the other hand, they can pick who they want in the wedding and do not have to apologize for it.", "Looking at OP\u2019s edit, Mark and Alisa have included everyone in their friend group and OP\u2019s boyfriend, but excluded only OP. I\u2019d be hurt too, especially since they\u2019ve been friends with OP longer than they\u2019ve known her boyfriend. This excuse about numbers is BS. Mark and Alisa ruined this friendship, not OP.

You understand this wedding isn\u2019t about you, right?", "YTA. Sounds like you (were) friends with Mark, but not his fianc\u00e9.

Your ego really got in the way of a fun time and what sounded like a good friendship.\n\nHonestly, you never know who and why the bridesmaids \"positions\" are full, but it's not really personal. Lots of family, or she's been a bridesmaid a lot of times and feels like she owes other women. Nothing at all against you. But you made their union a personal issue, and lot friends over it.", "I know I am going to get MASSIVELY downvoted for this. \ud83d\ude22\n\nBut after going back and forth I am going with ESH rather than Y T A because I feel like ultimately, your friends are being the bigger AHs. \n\n Mark and his fianc\u00e9e should have known ahead of time that it\u2019s kind of insulting that you\u2019ve been his good friend since high school and he\u2019s including your boyfriend in his wedding party and not you. I think the considerate thing to have done was to not include you both or at least have a proper conversation with you about it. \n\nI think you crossed the line by **expecting** to be a bridesmaid, confronting him about it and saying that stuff about your boyfriend. The last thing was really not cool. \n\nI totally agree with the other comments that say that time is not at all a benchmark for how good a friendship is, but I think they should have let you know ahead of time because you are operating under the assumption that you are very close with Mark and since you\u2019ve vacationed with them as a couple, his fianc\u00e9e as well. They sort of just blindsided you and I get why you feel so hurt. \n\nYes, it is absolutely the bride and groom\u2019s prerogative about who gets invited to the wedding and who is involved in the wedding party. But, they should also have some consideration as to how those decisions affect their friendships after the wedding is over. \n\nThe only non-AH here is your boyfriend. He has done nothing wrong and I feel bad that he is caught up in the middle. \n\nAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter whether I think you\u2019re not an AH here. Mark thinks you are and does not want to apologise to you.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say ESH.  You are an asshole for thinking this is about you.  You supposed best friend is an Asshole for thinking gender matching his party is more important than friendship, your boyfriend is an asshole for being willing to do this when he knows these were YOUR friends and not his originally, and the fianc\u00e9e is an asshole because number matching is more important than friendship.\n\nThese are all, retrograde icky people.  Why not dodge the whole wedding and go find people to hang out with that don\u2019t suck?", "YTA\n\nI would simply refuse to blow up a whole friendship over this. Their wedding party is their choice, it's not owed to you. If you can't fully share their joy without getting a special role, it's probably better that you all just move on. They have nothing, absolutely nothing, to apologize for. You owe them an apology for assuming this wedding was about you.", "I\u2019m going with IDK. \n\nI will say, as someone who had everyone in her class get invited to a party but me, I know how hard it is to be left out. The issue is that Mark and his fianc\u00e9 are not good friends to you. Yes, they get to decide who is in their wedding party, but the way they went about it publicly is rude and hurtful. They new the consequences of only asking your boyfriend and not mentioning it to you. \n\nOn the bright side, your boyfriend sounds awesome. Kudos to him for sticking up for you.", "ESH. \n\nThere\u2019s just no way it\u2019s normal when *the entire friend group* is included and 1/2 of a couple *within that same friend group* is excluded. Maybe I\u2019m just bitter because I was that excluded girl once, and turned out it was because the bride was too busy setting my then-boyfriend up to cheat with her MOH. \n\nThat can\u2019t be anything other than a slight from the marrying couple, and you don\u2019t have to entertain that noise. But equally, you\u2019re not entitled to attend someone\u2019s wedding without being invited either.", "NTA I feel like you\u2019re not upset necessarily because you weren\u2019t in the wedding party, but because they made space for your boyfriend but not for YOU. If I\u2019m reading it right, you feel like your boyfriend is the preferred friend now over you. I think if he hadn\u2019t asked your boyfriend to be the groomsman, then I would say NAH leaning on YTA. But it was a really weird move of him to ask your boyfriend and not you. Why the hell can\u2019t you be a groomsman? It\u2019s 2023.", "YTA. What a thing to throw your friendship away over. You barely mention how close you are to Mark's fianc\u00e9e, and it completely makes sense for her to already have five people chosen for her bridal party.\n\nAlso, trying to downplay your boyfriend's relationship with these friends just because your feelings are hurt is not a good look.", "you seem to think you guys are closer than you are. and it\u2019s not your wedding, calm down.

Yeah YTA \n\nHonestly these days (what with all the wild expectations and expenses) you should be thankful not to be included", "ESH if anything you should have been asked to be in the grooms party. You're his friend.", "I have no problem understanding your disappointment. But I\u2019m sorry to say you became the AH when you let your disappointment express itself in anger and you took it out on your friend and his fianc\u00e9. This is something you have to deal with for yourself and put your adult hat on. I know it has a snug fit right now, but pull it down and make sure it\u2019s on so it won\u2019t fall off again in company with your friends.

YTA. There\u2019s a lot that goes into choosing your wedding party.", "YTA- Because yes you are Mark's friend but are you his fiance's friend? To be a bridesmaid you have to be close to the bride, sure some people take in consideration their partner's friends if they can. It seems that Mark's fianc\u00e9 had enough close friends / relatives on her side that there was no room for you. And it seems that they want the traditional bridal party, so they didn't elect to make you a groomswoman.  I'm not saying that you are an asshole because your feelings are hurt. You became the asshole when you \"confronted\" Mark about it.", "YTA.  Their wedding is not about you.  You don't demand to be honored at someone's wedding and you clearly aren't all that close with the bride since you are talking to Mark about it.", "YTA.  \n\n\nWay to make a day that isn\u2019t supposed to be about you, completely about you.

I\u2019m sure your reaction confirmed their choice that you\u2019d be a horrible choice for the wedding party and cause all sorts of drama.

The bride picks her bridesmaids and she doesn\u2019t want you. That\u2019s her choice.", "YTA. I can understand being a little hurt but you shouldn'wre wrong in confronting them about it and demanding an apology. My guess is the bride had 5 people locked in that she already wanted and the groom needed one more and thought of your boyfriend since it sounds like they developed a friendship outside of the couple relationship. Heck, maybe Mark thought that by asking your BF that it would then help include you both in the festivities that surround the wedding party. But instead you decided to make someone else's wedding about you and damaged a long time friendship. Hope it was worth it.", "I totally understand how you would feel hurt (almost betrayed) by them asking your BF instead of you.  This wasn't about you though.  It is THIER wedding day, not yours.   I'm sure the fianc\u00e9 wanted her close friends (or family) to be her bridesmaid.   Your friend Mark will always pick his fianc\u00e9 over you (and wouldn't we want him to anyway), he wants her to be happy.  You  shared your feelings, and he felt bad, but he was honest in telling you it is what they wanted.  Now that your BF declined (because of your influence I'm sure) they probably feel you betrayed them by making it out to be more than it was, and now you've lost your best friend and I doubt you'll get an invite.

For context, Mark and I have been good friends since high school. My boyfriend (28M) has also really bonded with Mark over the past two years of us dating, and they regularly go golfing together. We have also done lots of couples' vacations/dates/outings together and were seemingly very close to Mark and his fianc\u00e9e. My boyfriend and I just recently went to their house for a party, and Mark and his fianc\u00e9e asked my boyfriend (whom they know through me, and only for a couple of years) to be in the wedding party as a groomsman. I was not asked to be a bridesmaid, so I would not be involved in the wedding party at all. When I asked Mark about this, he said it was because they wanted even numbers (5 groomsmen and 5 bridesmaids) for the wedding party, and that his fianc\u00e9e already had enough bridesmaids.\n\nI thought for sure I would be asked to be in their wedding as a bridesmaid, seeing as they were my good friends and I would have 100% included them in my wedding party if I ever got married. So not only was I not asked to be in their wedding party, but my boyfriend, whom they'd known for all of two seconds, was. I felt very hurt that they would ask him to be a part of their big day but not me. I confronted Mark about how hurt/sad/angry I was about this, especially because I don't know if my boyfriend and I will even still be together a year from now. Mark told me that he was sorry that my feelings were hurt, but he and his fianc\u00e9e don't want to apologize for doing what they want with their wedding. Mark told me that this situation has impacted our friendship, especially since he doesn't think they have anything to apologize for.

Asking everyone else while you\u2019re present, and excluding you without a heads up, is also a jerk move.\n\nBut it\u2019s their wedding. They can do what they want and invite who they want. And whether you and your boyfriend would be together is irrelevant, as Mark would likely continue a friendship with him outside of your relationship. And you threw what essentially amounted to a temper tantrum over it. \n\nDon\u2019t let one event ruin a lifelong friendship. It\u2019s not worth it. Yes it\u2019ll be a shitty process and a crappy day for you, watching them all enjoy the experience without you, but your friend is getting married and you\u2019ll always regret not being a part of it in whatever way you can.", "NTA, this sounds incredibly hurtful and I\u2019m honestly shocked so many people think this is completely acceptable behavior. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a friendship-breaker in itself, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I gave the friendship the same weight after this. Especially that your boyfriend was included over you. Aside, it feels like that might\u2019ve been something to do with gender l, as though you couldn\u2019t be on the groom\u2019s side, and I have always found that kind of thinking so utterly toxic and confusing. I\u2019m sorry that this happened to you.", "We have been off/on again because he travels a lot for work and may even have to permanently move again in the near future. We haven't decided if we would try long distance if that were to happen, or if I would move with him. We decided to cross that bridge when we get there. It's not that I don't think that we will last the year, we just both have done long distance before and decided that might not be the best solution for us.", "OP is the one that should apologize. It\u2019s always the rando chicks that bring on the drama at weddings. Ugh. That is why people shy away from giving plus ones to singletons at weddings.", "Judging by her responses, not sure that she does.", "Agree with ESH, I was thinking Y-T-A until the edit. She's the only one excluded in the entire friend group? If that's accurate, yeah, I can see why she's hurt, it's painful to realize your friends don't actually like you as much as you thought they did. But she never should have escalated and made the issue sound like just jealousy that her BF got asked not her, when the root issue is she's the only one being excluded, and the comment about her and her BF potentially breaking up was weird.\n\nAlso not agreeing that it's more important to have an even number in the party than it is to have all your friends...? Either the friends are being pretty unkind for caring more about optics than their friend, or it was just an excuse to exclude OP and they don't think of her as being that close. Them not even offering her a heads up seems callous if they indeed have a circle of friends that are all included but her.", "Big time agree. It\u2019s true that Mark and Op\u2019s boyfriend may have their own relationship, but this is kinda one of those comes with pair thingy. Unless Mark actually short of friends that he has to fill in his friend\u2019s boyfriend, I just dont see why.", "The entitlement in this post is gross.", "So the bride should bump out her own sisters and sister in laws, cousins and best friends to give a side chick a position of honor? OP and her bf are \u201con and off\u201d , you understand that couples don\u2019t have time to keep with whomever the GM are sleeping with at the moment, right? And it is too expensive to honor everyone they know, right? What if when they decided they were broken off again? What if they are together, and then on the wedding festivities they break up again and bring on the drama (as shown exhibit A) or relinquish duties because they don\u2019t want to be together etc. their relationship is NOT stable, and no one can plan based on on and off relationships. They know the BF , not her, she ain\u2019t owed anything. The couple is better off without their ridiculous drama", "I think we are focusing too much on the bridesmaid issue. I think, if I am reading her post correctly, it has more to do with feeling like she isn\u2019t part of the group even though she has been \u201cfriends\u201d with them for a long time. It\u2019s more the meaning behind why she wasn\u2019t asked that was the main issue (which you pretty much covered in you comment).", "I agree with your post. NTA. Honestly, true friends should consider other peoples feelings whether it\u2019s their wedding or any other special occasion. How would they feel if they were treated in the same manner?  I think anyone\u2019s feeling would be deeply hurt being treated this way. It was uncalled for. They are all close enough that they have been hanging out for yrs together. Why not add another person so it would be even. The engaged couples are AH in my opinion.", "This is what I was thinking. I was a grooms girl for my brother in 2006.", "Tbf the bf is my preferred character in this story. OP is an entitled asshole who only thinks of herself and not her friends or bf.", "They\u2019ve invited everyone from their friend group to be in the wedding party, and excluded only OP. That\u2019s no way to treat a friend they\u2019ve known longer than (they\u2019ve known) her partner.", "Also, some people just click and time doesn\u2019t matter. Perhaps the BF and Mark became super close due to shared background or common interest. \n\nIt\u2019s not the length of time a person is your friend, it is the connection you cultivate that matters.\n\nEdit - forgot judgement YTA OP and possibly ruined your friendship and your BF\u2019s in the process.", "Exactly. Random GMs gfs don\u2019t decide on who should be in the wedding party.", "The entire time they have been together, which is about 8 years.", "I think the post states she has known her for 8 yrs ???", "Clearly not that much of a friend. Proof: He likes her boyfriend more, they hang out without her, and she wasn\u2019t asked. Sounds like she thinks she\u2019s closer to these friends than she really is.", "Best answer yet", "This. With friends like this, who needs enemies", "Agreed. Pretty sure this friendship is toast. \n\nOh the entitlement of some people.\n\nYTA.", "Maybe I'm insane, but that seems easier said than done when you have to watch literally all your close friends and your boyfriend participate in their big day, knowing they didn't want you to be a part of it. It doesn't even have to be about the wedding. If they planned a simple trip to the zoo with everyone and excluded me, I'd still feel hurt.", "Correct, I didn't expect to be asked to stand in the wedding initially. I also didn't expect them to ask everyone in our friend group except me, including my bf, all on the same day at the same time. After that, it kinda felt shitty.", "So if you are an on and off person, then why do you think you are entitled to be the bridesmaid of someone you don\u2019t even socialize with?\n\nWow. The couple made the right decision. Congratulations with ruining a long friendship with your sense of entitlement, immaturity and oafish demands. Wow.", "Sounds like OP threw that argument in bc she didn\u2019t have another leg to stand on for making the wedding about herself", "Where in this story did you read that OP is a \"rando chick?\" She was friends with both of the couple first", "I also think excluding someone because of unbalanced bridal parties is really dumb. I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid six times and have only been in one wedding with even bridal parties (and it was initially uneven, someone dropped out last second due to COVID). Have as many or as few people in your bridal Party that you want but don\u2019t use even bridal parties as an excuse to exclude people.", "Um you might want to read the post again - OP has been friends with the groom for over a decade, & with the bride for 8 years. OP's BF has known them 2 years. BF only met the bride & groom through OP.", "Where are you getting that the couple know the Bf and not her? They have known her for at least 8 years. I didn\u2019t say they have to bump anyone for her, I said she is owed a conversation when she is being excluded and she is rightfully hurt.", "So you obviously just can't read lol", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entitled to be blindsided that your lifelong friend chose your boyfriend over you", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being downvoted for answering the question.", "So what? She apparently has sisters/ cousins/ friends she\u2019s closer to. In the grand scheme of things there are more important people in her life than you, and that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s not a slight or an insult to you although you might not like it. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to feel bummed but it\u2019s not ok to make a big deal out of it and lose your bff in the process", "You\u2019re exhausting", "INFO:  If you \"never expected\" to be in the wedding party, why did you \"for sure\" think you would be asked?  You contradict yourself.", "The on/off bit was about my boyfriend and I, not my friends. I'm not sure where you got the idea that we don't socialize together. Our entire friend group, including Mark and Alisa, gets together every week for trivia, and then pretty much every weekend. Also, Alisa (Mark's fiancee) and I are members of the same gym, so I'd meet up with her solo at least once a week, or at least I used to before all this.", "They aren\u2019t your friends. I would definitely distance yourself from them and find a new friend group. The fact that they didn\u2019t sit you down and explain why you couldn\u2019t be a bridesmaid before they asked your boyfriend to be part of the wedding party is a good indicator that they aren\u2019t worth remaining friends with.  It is also upsetting that they invited all of your other mutual friends to be in the wedding party except for you."]}
