{"id": 15132, "submission_id": "12r0sys", "title": "AITA for being angry that I wasn't asked to be in the wedding party?", "selftext": "One of my (28F) best friends, Mark (28M), just got engaged and he and his fianc\u00e9e are planning to get married next Spring. For context, Mark and I have been good friends since high school. My boyfriend (28M) has also really bonded with Mark over the past two years of us dating, and they regularly go golfing together. We have also done lots of couples' vacations/dates/outings together and were seemingly very close to Mark and his fianc\u00e9e. My boyfriend and I just recently went to their house for a party, and Mark and his fianc\u00e9e asked my boyfriend (whom they know through me, and only for a couple of years) to be in the wedding party as a groomsman. I was not asked to be a bridesmaid, so I would not be involved in the wedding party at all. When I asked Mark about this, he said it was because they wanted even numbers (5 groomsmen and 5 bridesmaids) for the wedding party, and that his fianc\u00e9e already had enough bridesmaids.\n\nI thought for sure I would be asked to be in their wedding as a bridesmaid, seeing as they were my good friends and I would have 100% included them in my wedding party if I ever got married. So not only was I not asked to be in their wedding party, but my boyfriend, whom they'd known for all of two seconds, was. I felt very hurt that they would ask him to be a part of their big day but not me. I confronted Mark about how hurt/sad/angry I was about this, especially because I don't know if my boyfriend and I will even still be together a year from now. Mark told me that he was sorry that my feelings were hurt, but he and his fianc\u00e9e don't want to apologize for doing what they want with their wedding. Mark told me that this situation has impacted our friendship, especially since he doesn't think they have anything to apologize for. My boyfriend declined to be a groomsman and we haven't spoken to Mark since. AITA?\n\nEDIT - Just to clarify, I never **expected** to be asked to be in their wedding. Of course I would love to be in their wedding party because they are my friends (I have been friends with Mark since I was 16 and friends with Alisa (Mark's fiancee) for going on 8 years now) and I would love to celebrate their love and happiness, but I never ever demanded it. If they never would have asked either of us to be in the wedding, I would have been totally fine with that. It's that they asked everyone else in our friend group to be in it, including my boyfriend. Everyone except me. When Alisa (Mark's fiancee) talked to me about it, she said the only reason she didn't ask me to be in the wedding was because of the matching wedding party numbers, which was disappointing and hurt. I totally understand that it is their wedding and they should do what they like, but I also hoped they wouldn't exclude me like that because of wedding party numbers. I know everyone says to not make it about me - but what do you do in that situation? Not say anything at all? I just felt a little blindsided. Maybe Mark and I weren't as close as we thought. Perhaps it's all for the best.\n\nNOTE: people are taking the boyfriend bit way out of context\u2026 my boyfriend and I have been off/on because of long distance issues, but we love each other deeply. He is currently living back home but that might change in the near future (he might have to move across the county for work and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to uproot my life and move with him yet). That\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure where we will be in a year from now. It\u2019s all up in the air currently.", "created_utc": 1681845297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r0sys/aita_for_being_angry_that_i_wasnt_asked_to_be_in/", "score": 650, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Groom has been socializing solo with your bf for two years (which you change to \"all of two seconds\" at the end of your story) and selected him as a groomsman.

You understand this wedding isn\u2019t about you, right?", "YTA. Sounds like you (were) friends with Mark, but not his fianc\u00e9.

I think the considerate thing to have done was to not include you both or at least have a proper conversation with you about it. \n\nI think you crossed the line by **expecting** to be a bridesmaid, confronting him about it and saying that stuff about your boyfriend. The last thing was really not cool. \n\nI totally agree with the other comments that say that time is not at all a benchmark for how good a friendship is, but I think they should have let you know ahead of time because you are operating under the assumption that you are very close with Mark and since you\u2019ve vacationed with them as a couple, his fianc\u00e9e as well. They sort of just blindsided you and I get why you feel so hurt. \n\nYes, it is absolutely the bride and groom\u2019s prerogative about who gets invited to the wedding and who is involved in the wedding party. But, they should also have some consideration as to how those decisions affect their friendships after the wedding is over. \n\nThe only non-AH here is your boyfriend. He has done nothing wrong and I feel bad that he is caught up in the middle. \n\nAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter whether I think you\u2019re not an AH here. Mark thinks you are and does not want to apologise to you.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say ESH.  You are an asshole for thinking this is about you.  You supposed best friend is an Asshole for thinking gender matching his party is more important than friendship, your boyfriend is an asshole for being willing to do this when he knows these were YOUR friends and not his originally, and the fianc\u00e9e is an asshole because number matching is more important than friendship.\n\nThese are all, retrograde icky people.  Why not dodge the whole wedding and go find people to hang out with that don\u2019t suck?", "YTA\n\nI would simply refuse to blow up a whole friendship over this. Their wedding party is their choice, it's not owed to you. If you can't fully share their joy without getting a special role, it's probably better that you all just move on. They have nothing, absolutely nothing, to apologize for. You owe them an apology for assuming this wedding was about you.", "I\u2019m going with IDK. \n\nI will say, as someone who had everyone in her class get invited to a party but me, I know how hard it is to be left out. The issue is that Mark and his fianc\u00e9 are not good friends to you. Yes, they get to decide who is in their wedding party, but the way they went about it publicly is rude and hurtful. They new the consequences of only asking your boyfriend and not mentioning it to you. \n\nOn the bright side, your boyfriend sounds awesome. Kudos to him for sticking up for you.", "ESH. \n\nThere\u2019s just no way it\u2019s normal when *the entire friend group* is included and 1/2 of a couple *within that same friend group* is excluded. Maybe I\u2019m just bitter because I was that excluded girl once, and turned out it was because the bride was too busy setting my then-boyfriend up to cheat with her MOH. \n\nThat can\u2019t be anything other than a slight from the marrying couple, and you don\u2019t have to entertain that noise. But equally, you\u2019re not entitled to attend someone\u2019s wedding without being invited either.", "NTA I feel like you\u2019re not upset necessarily because you weren\u2019t in the wedding party, but because they made space for your boyfriend but not for YOU. If I\u2019m reading it right, you feel like your boyfriend is the preferred friend now over you. I think if he hadn\u2019t asked your boyfriend to be the groomsman, then I would say NAH leaning on YTA. But it was a really weird move of him to ask your boyfriend and not you. Why the hell can\u2019t you be a groomsman? It\u2019s 2023.", "YTA. What a thing to throw your friendship away over. You barely mention how close you are to Mark's fianc\u00e9e, and it completely makes sense for her to already have five people chosen for her bridal party.\n\nAlso, trying to downplay your boyfriend's relationship with these friends just because your feelings are hurt is not a good look.", "you seem to think you guys are closer than you are. and it\u2019s not your wedding, calm down.

You're his friend.", "I have no problem understanding your disappointment. But I\u2019m sorry to say you became the AH when you let your disappointment express itself in anger and you took it out on your friend and his fianc\u00e9. This is something you have to deal with for yourself and put your adult hat on. I know it has a snug fit right now, but pull it down and make sure it\u2019s on so it won\u2019t fall off again in company with your friends.

YTA. There\u2019s a lot that goes into choosing your wedding party.", "YTA- Because yes you are Mark's friend but are you his fiance's friend? To be a bridesmaid you have to be close to the bride, sure some people take in consideration their partner's friends if they can. It seems that Mark's fianc\u00e9 had enough close friends / relatives on her side that there was no room for you.

The bride picks her bridesmaids and she doesn\u2019t want you. That\u2019s her choice.", "YTA. I can understand being a little hurt but you shouldn'wre wrong in confronting them about it and demanding an apology. My guess is the bride had 5 people locked in that she already wanted and the groom needed one more and thought of your boyfriend since it sounds like they developed a friendship outside of the couple relationship. Heck, maybe Mark thought that by asking your BF that it would then help include you both in the festivities that surround the wedding party.

Your friend Mark will always pick his fianc\u00e9 over you (and wouldn't we want him to anyway), he wants her to be happy.  You  shared your feelings, and he felt bad, but he was honest in telling you it is what they wanted.

For context, Mark and I have been good friends since high school. My boyfriend (28M) has also really bonded with Mark over the past two years of us dating, and they regularly go golfing together. We have also done lots of couples' vacations/dates/outings together and were seemingly very close to Mark and his fianc\u00e9e. My boyfriend and I just recently went to their house for a party, and Mark and his fianc\u00e9e asked my boyfriend (whom they know through me, and only for a couple of years) to be in the wedding party as a groomsman. I was not asked to be a bridesmaid, so I would not be involved in the wedding party at all. When I asked Mark about this, he said it was because they wanted even numbers (5 groomsmen and 5 bridesmaids) for the wedding party, and that his fianc\u00e9e already had enough bridesmaids.\n\nI thought for sure I would be asked to be in their wedding as a bridesmaid, seeing as they were my good friends and I would have 100% included them in my wedding party if I ever got married. So not only was I not asked to be in their wedding party, but my boyfriend, whom they'd known for all of two seconds, was. I felt very hurt that they would ask him to be a part of their big day but not me. I confronted Mark about how hurt/sad/angry I was about this, especially because I don't know if my boyfriend and I will even still be together a year from now. Mark told me that he was sorry that my feelings were hurt, but he and his fianc\u00e9e don't want to apologize for doing what they want with their wedding. Mark told me that this situation has impacted our friendship, especially since he doesn't think they have anything to apologize for. My boyfriend declined to be a groomsman and we haven't spoken to Mark since. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Should they have thought about their friends group as a whole and tried to include the one left-out person in some way? Probably. Could they have talked to you about the situation in advance, rather than letting you be blindsided? Yes. Could they offer a compromise to include you as a ____ (usher or something)? Maybe. But as far as I know, we are all human, and missing something like this doesn't make them AH unless it was on purpose; it just makes them thoughtless. \n\nWhich brings us to you. Could you try to be the bigger person and accept what they told you at face value? Yes. Could you accept a difference of opinion, be happy for them, and remain friends instead of icing them out? Maybe. That is where you might appear to be an AH.

Big old stinky AH you.", "Soft NTA.\nI go with NTA simply because I would feel very hurt too and it is a shitty move to include everyone but one person in a group. \nBut I get that it's not OP's wedding and the bride and groom in general are allowed to call the shots so to say but as this is AITA I say it is pretty AH behaviour to invite the boyfriend of someone but not the person themselves and then making apologies about how the numbers are important. Why is Symmetrie more important than friendship for them? Also, why can't Mark make you his grooms woman? Like why can't you have a special dress that is different from the bridesmaids and maybe more in line with the suits of the groomsmen? Why not make this a special occasion to celebrate the couple and the family and friends? \n\nIdk I feel that there might be more to it than simply symmetry. And I would be also very hurt if my boyfriend is asked to be in the party but I am not on the pretense of symmetry.", "YTA. The groom asks men to be the groomsman. The bride asks women to be her bridesmaids. Seeing as your marks friend your shit outta luck.", "\"I thought for sure I would be asked to be in their wedding as a bridesmaid\"\n\n\"EDIT - Just to clarify, I never expected to be asked to be in their wedding\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich one is it now? Are you trying to make excuses or...?\n\nYTA OP", "YTA. They can only ask who they want. The fianc\u00e9 has her own best friends and it\u2019s not you. Just be a gracious friend and wish them all the best. Put your ego aside.", "I\u2019m going with NAH. \nYes it\u2019s OPs friend\u2019s wedding so they get to pick whoever they want. \nYes OPs feelings are also valid. Communication (without making demands) is healthy. This shows OP that Mark and fianc\u00e9 are maybe not the best friends they thought they were and OP can move on.", "YTA Not because you are [hurt.No](https://hurt.No) one gets to decide what hurts you. However, YTA because you confronted the groom about it. More than once. Actually arguing? Wow. HE is your close friend & he chose his groomsMEN. She chose her bridesmaids. I cannot imagine embarrassing myself by asking why I was not included in someone's wedding party. Not. About. You. You should have vented your hurt feelings to your BF & then let it go. Now you've ruined a friendship.", "YTA. \nSaying this from someone who has been in this exact position. Someone who I am so close woth got engaged. Everyone was in the party (my partner included) and I wasn't. Did it suck? Yer. But I completely understood. Hair, makeup, dresses, shoes all that shit is expenceive. \nI still went to the dress shopping, bridal shower, hens night. Still had all the fun. Just sister have to stand around for hours getting photos half way through the day. Ended great for me.", "Why are there so many double posts in AITA. Her boyfriend just posted about the exact same situation.", "NTA. Things like wedding invites and bridal parties are where you realise the people you consider your closest friends in the world might not feel the same about you and it hurts, no matter what anyone says. Now you know where you stand with these two friends and you can adjust your friendship accordingly.", "NTA. It\u2019s hurtful.", "NTA - I would see this as a pretty pointed exclusion. You made your point now though, and if I were you I\u2019d concentrate on making some new friends and leaving those who don\u2019t value you behind, because these guys made it clear they don\u2019t. \n\nMaybe moving with your bf IS a good way to start over.", "I agree. This is an absolute shit show. \n\nI\u2019m also extremely anti wedding party as a whole so\u2026", "Considering they needed OP\u2019s bf as a last minute addition to \u201cbalance numbers\u201d, it seems this engaged couple is not very good at maintaining friendships.", "She got invited she just isnt a bridesmaid", "Please separate the Y T A, or it will be counted as a vote.", "100 per cent this!", "It\u2019s their wedding, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re free from the consequences of their choices. OP has every right to be hurt that they\u2019ve invited the entirety of their friend group and excluded only her. They don\u2019t get to dictate how OP feels about this.", "Im guessing shes toxic and exhausting to be around no way the bf would throw away 12 years of friendship", "When the couple decided to exclude OP but not the others in the group, then like it or not, they MADE it about OP.", "Mark and Alisa are free to choose but they\u2019re not free from the consequences of their choices. They have no right to tell OP how to feel about the fact they snubbed her. They\u2019re entitled to their choices and she\u2019s entitled to her feelings about said choices. Mark and Alisa became the A-H when they included the entire group but OP, and then told her to get over it and apologise, when all she did was share her feelings.", "Agreed. Also, if you value gender norms and prioritise getting matching genitals lined up next to you over the actual real-world makeup of your friends group, then you're an asshole. Because I don't think the issue is the bride's wedding party so much as the groom's. She's the groom's friend and she was passed over for her boyfriend (who might also be friendly with everyone but she's still the tie between him and the group).", ">She's the only one excluded in the entire friend group? If that's accurate, yeah, I can see why she's hurt, it's painful to realize your friends don't actually like you as much as you thought they did. \n\nYup, this swayed me to go with ESH as well. This is pretty hurtful IMO.", "This. She didn't handle it ideally, but it's definitely valid that she feels left out if she's literally the only person in her friend group that isn't in the wedding party *and* they asked her boyfriend instead of her. That feels pointed. \n\nLike OK so there's a limited number and no space on the bride's side - why couldn't she stand up for her friend with the groomsmen? Does the wedding party really need to value a strict gender divide over the people that are actually present in their friend group?", "\nThat was my take, too. OP had a sudden and harsh reality check that she is more invested in this friendship. And she reacted spur of the moment style. Can't fault her for that. Also, one can't fault the bride and groom for choosing the people they want in their bridal parties.", "Most brides skip the fiance's opposite-sex 'bestie' for their bridal attendants. Sounds like Alissa has been very gracious in accepting the friendship & they've shared many good times, but OP doesn't detail independently hanging with the bride in a way that would justify being in her personal inner circle.", "Then she should reflect on why no one likes her.....", "That quote though, wtf? He was asked because he and the groom are friends, if they split up, the guys friendship would still remain. It's not like her bf going to the wedding still depends on them being together.", "I wonder if she mentioned that to her bf when she told him the story about her and her friend\u2019s conversation", "I never understood this trend. If you ask someone to be in your wedding party, you should pay for most if not all of their expenses", "OP should include if the other people in the friend group are groomsmen or bridesmaids. She\u2019s still TA to me regardless.", "Plenty of people do have groomswomen and bridesmen. I honestly didn't think that was too controversial now.", "Yeah good point. It\u2019s actually pretty insulting to the bf too as he\u2019s clearly just there to make up the numbers for one of the bride\u2019s friends. So lame.", "Or they could have asked OP. Why does she need to be on the bride's side? Why couldn't she stand with her friend as part of the groom's party?", "There is nowhere in the post where they told the OP to apologize. They said they don\u2019t feel like they have to apologize. They also didn\u2019t tell her how to feel, they just said that she didn\u2019t need to confront them over it. Which I completely agree with, especially since OP is basically implying that she should be replaced with her boyfriend in the wedding party, which is super ridiculous. Also regarding the edit about the friend group, i feel like a lot of assumptions are being made about this. It\u2019s cool if you have a different opinion though.", "2 years of friendship isn\u2019t really something to scoff at. If the groom is closer to the boyfriend, why should he have to put OP in his party just because he\u2019s known her longer? One of my longtime friends wasn\u2019t in my bridal party because she and I aren\u2019t as close as some of my other friends now.", "It\u2019s also something the bride and groom will never, ever care about after the wedding. When you wedding plan, there are all these ideas you get stuck in your head that really matter at the time that in retrospect just super don\u2019t. \n\nI definitely think they\u2019ll feel the loss of the friendships with OP and bf a lot more than their perfectly balanced bridal party.", "So then why did Mark have to ask OPs BF, why couldn't they just do 4 each if even numbers were their priority.\n\nI agree with ESH and that OP needs to re-evaluate you she sees as friends.", "Groomswomen exist. He could have asked OP to fill out his side.", "Having upset feelings is valid. Acting on them was inappropriate. There have been weddings when I thought I was going to be in the bridal party and wasn\u2019t - did I make it about me and try to force myself into the party or ruin the experience for the couple? No. I either went or didn\u2019t, sent a gift, and was happy for my friends. \n\nThere\u2019s so much that goes into picking bridal parties, it\u2019s not always just \u201coh I like you so you\u2019re in\u201d. No one is entitled to be in the bridal party.", "I\u2019d rather not be in the wedding party generally, it\u2019s a lot of work! Also you don\u2019t get to choose your dress normally, and you\u2019ve got to be up and about earlier. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say she still won\u2019t be invited on the hen do though, which in my opinion is the most fun part.", "OP: *I'm very upset my 'bestie' went golfing with my ex. How do I recover from this betrayal?*", "Neither do I. Such a huge ask to have someone spend to attend everything and buy gifts, clothes, trips etc.", "I've never understood why people \"pool\" their wedding parties along gender lines to make thing neater for the wedding photos. Just keep your friends on your side of the wedding party! \n\nWhich is to say that of course OP shouldn't have been forced into the bride's party if they don't know each other well - but she also shouldn't have been excluded from Mark's wedding party because she has the wrong gender.", "Because the bride has 5 friends she wants to include, that\u2019s the whole purpose of asking the boyfriend to even out the numbers.", "He could have but didn\u2019t want to. He\u2019s allowed to be friends with the boyfriend and want to include him.", "Might be time to leave that small town hun ...", "It doesn\u2019t, but if OP thought she and the fianc\u00e9 were close and not the other way around, then obviously OP is going to be hurt.", "OMG! Yes! OP explains everything about her relationship with Mark and his fiance and the couple activities but nothing of girl bonding activities with Mark's fiance. She also conveniently leaves out who these common friends are and how commonly they hang out in groups. Some questions:\n\n1) Does op hang out with these common friends and Mark and his fiance ? Do they do any/all activities together? Are these common friends more of Mark's fiance's friend or Mark's friends? Do these friends do everything with you? How often do you hangout outside of couple hangout? \n\nTo me it looks like couples friendship to me. \n\nI think a lot of the people here are imagining a sitcom FRIENDS scenario. But honestly, it looks like A and B continuously invite few people and you have considered them groups. This group of friends might be doing their own thing when they are hosting/hanging out.", "Why did she need to be a bridesmaid? I think it's fair for her not to be part of the wedding party for a bride she doesn't know well, but she could have been part of Mark's wedding party...", "This is a wedding where they are so traditional that they didn't even consider OP could be a groomswoman. I doubt they'll have a sweetheart table.", "NTA OP.\n\nClearly you found out how much your friendship means to them.\n\nBTW I kind of wonder about how Mark's fianc\u00e9e feels with her bridal party being mostly his people. Their even numbers excuse could be her way of taking a stand without causing a direct confrontation with her future husband. Because if my country did this bridesmaid/groomsmen shit, I seriously wouldn't want some of my partner's female friends be a bridesmaid just because I have less people I'm close to. I understand it's costum that you're then stuck having to hang out with them during important moments of the day, so nope.", "Yeah, sounds like couple's friendship to me, too, for Alisa. However OP was friends with Mark before that and clearly valued that friendship more than Mark did. I believe she's allowed to be hurt by that. I would be, too, if I had misjudged a friendship like that. Apparently to Mark she's an acquintance.", "Yeah, Mark did have an answer. He was just too chicken and/or too polite to say it to her."]}
