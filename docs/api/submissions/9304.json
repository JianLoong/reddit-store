Let's call her Abby. On Friday when Abby was in P.E. a boy lost his wallet that had around $200 inside (cash not card). The teacher, who is a female, held all the kids inside the gym telling them no one was allowed to leave until he got it back. This by its self pisses me off because it is the end of class and they still needed to change before lunch started. The teacher has them all sat on the ground of the gym as she pulls out the bleachers to look if it fell behind them. This is already after the bell rang and lunch is happening. Finally, after probably 10 minutes of them sitting on the ground, the teachers husband, who is also a gym teacher there, and a security guard come in. The security guard starts having the boys empty their pockets as he pats them to make sure they're empty and the teacher takes the girls to the other side of the gym. There she does the same as the security guards did to the boys but also had them pull up their shirts and shake them to make sure it wasn't in their bras. This is where I am really mad. Abby is a good kid- good grades, polite, and kind. She shouldn't have had to do all of this humiliating things when all the boys were just across the gym from them watching. Not to mention the teachers husband wasn't even doing anything just standing there watching. As soon as Abby called me I drove down to the school and asked to see the principle. All he told me was that it's what they had to do to find the wallet and it's not a big deal. (They didn't even find the wallet by the way) I am livid at this point and just barge out and ask for my daughter to come home with me. I kept her home from school today (Monday).

Students might have things on them that are embarrassing, like love letters, personal hygiene items, etc.\n* Any physical contact during a search must be done by a staff member the same sex as the student.\n* Under no circumstances is a strip search permissible.\n\nThere's argument as to whether the first requirement applies, but nothing else they did was remotely legal.", "NTA.
