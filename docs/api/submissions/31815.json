She wasn't going to tell me but winded up telling me anyway. Last year I purchased some really nice books for my niece (12f) for Christmas. I guess my brother and his wife just let my niece tear out every single page and completely destroy all the books. Not only let but they *encouraged* it because \"that's her way of playing with the books\". My mom decided not to tell me until now as she didn't want to hurt my feelings. I'm pretty upset because I know for a fact that my niece does fine with books at school and loves being read to. She's only tearing books up at home because my brother and his wife allow it.\n\nI told my brother that I'm not buying her presents this year because I don't want to put a lot of thought into a gift only for it to get destroyed. His wife is pissed off at me and saying that I'm only doing this because she's autistic and that it's not fair.\n\nOur mothers on my side but dad thinks that I'm being ridiculous and that I'm going to look like an asshole at Christmas for excluding my niece from presents (I've bought her presents every single year thus far).  Now I'm wondering, AMIA?\n\nEdit: A bit more info. I don't really want to buy her cheap gifts I enjoy putting thought into the gifts I give her, that's why I'm so upset. Also I did buy her \"cheaper\" gifts one year because I was short on cash and my brother's sister just winded up returning them to the store for money. I'm kind of fed up and don't want to buy anything anymore.

The fact that you feel that only an expensive gift is a thoughtful one, and that the gift should be used *only* in the way *you* want it to be used... well... that means you are actually a *bad* gift giver.\n\nIf you are stuck on giving her expensive books and if you are also stuck on wanting her to do nothing else with those books except read them, then consider donating them to her school classroom.", "Buckets of confetti, a drum set...etc.", "YTA.

My son has an intellectual disability. He loved to tape everything so for Christmas we bought him scotch tape and masking tape and duct tape. He was really into paper so we bought him notebooks and other paper. We knew he would destroy most of it but we didn\u2019t care. We also, however, didn\u2019t buy expensive books.

Autism is not an excuse for destroying things, that's bad parenting.", "I understand why you are upset but the fact is that once you give someone a gift it becomes theirs to do anything at all they want to do with it. Re-gift it, return it, sell it, rip the pages out and use it to line their bird cages etc. I used to see this type of hurt in quilting groups where people would spend up to a year making a beautiful quilt as a wedding gift, birthday gift, family heirloom etc only to discover it had been given away/donated to charity or was being used in the dog's bed, the garage with greasy car parts on it, a picnic rug etc and it was understandable that the maker was upset by them not using it as intended and/or understanding the hours and love that went into making it but once it was gifted it was no longer theirs. The recipients were not obliged to like it and it was up to them what they did with it.\n\nIn the same manner you of course have every right to be upset by what has happened but I think you're acting on emotions with the decision to never buy your niece gifts again and will probably decide otherwise fairly soon. I would continue to buy her gifts but instead of lovely books that can be destroyed maybe switch to consumable gifts like art sets, jewelry making kits, bakeable clay sets etc. Hopefully she will enjoy using them, her mother can help if needed and at the end of the day the gifts affordable and are made to be used ( and eventually thrown out ).
