Money\u2019s been tight, so my wife and I saved up to get it for her for Christmas. I couldn\u2019t wait to give it to her.\n\nEDIT: My wife is Kayla\u2019s biological mother, since people keep assuming she\u2019s her step-mom. \n\nThe other day, I come home from work and find Kayla upset, my wife in a mood and our son, Martin, (15) looking pleased. I asked my wife in private what was going on. She started venting to me that Kayla is an ungrateful brat, we should return her gift, etc. She then explained that she and our son decided to pull a small prank our daughter. \n\nMartin told Kayla that my wife had told him that instead of the laptop, she Kayla was getting the amount it\u2019d cost in gift cards to various stores (clothing, food, etc, not places you could buy a laptop), because she felt she wasn\u2019t ready for one. Kayla got very upset and asked my wife if this was true. My wife said yes and added \u201cmaybe next year\u201d. Kayla got upset and said this wasn\u2019t fair, she had only asked for one thing. Clearly money wasn\u2019t an issue. My wife admits she started laughing, which made Kayla even more upset and she told my wife she was a jerk. \n\nMy wife feels how Kayla reacted to the prank \u201cshowed her true colors\u201d and \u201cwhat if we couldn\u2019t afford it\u201d. I pointed out that we had told Kayla in the past that we couldn\u2019t afford it and she took it well. It seems that the issue was knowing we had the money and could\u2019ve bought it, but allegedly didn\u2019t. I asked her what she expected to come from this little prank and called her childish for roping Martin into it. I said I\u2019m not returning the laptop. My wife is mad at me and says Kayla needs to be punished.\n\nI also made my wife tell Kayla it was all a prank. Kayla apologized for calling my wife a jerk but said the prank was super hurtful. My wife refused to apologize and doubled down that she doesn\u2019t feel Kayla deserves it. Martin did apologize for his role. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702928707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lhliz/aita_for_refusing_to_return_my_daughters/", "score": 2765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your wife is. \n\nShe\u2019s a grown woman who knowingly upset your daughter, but why? I think for this exact reason. Obviously she knew Kayla would be hurt, the \u201cprank\u201d was mean spirited and probably engineered to get a reaction from Kayla that she deemed unacceptable so that she could have Kayla\u2019s gift returned. Seems like there some issues there that your wife needs to sort out, maybe she\u2019s got some jealously for your daughter, I don\u2019t know.

Your wife may be creating an unintended environment that could effect the way he treats women in the future.", "NTA, but your wife is being deliberately cruel and baiting a teenager. \n\nA teenager does not have the emotional balance to always control her reactions or emotions - hence the occasional outburst. \n\nIn theory, your wife *should* have emotional balance and maturity, right?  A joke is only a joke if everyone is laughing, and your daughter was not laughing at being toyed with like that. \n\nYa\u2019ll need some therapy, or at least your wife does, because that kind of nasty undermining of emotional growth can result in trauma. \n\nOr do you *want* your daughter to exclude you from her life when she hits 18 because your wife thought it was funny to be cruel throughout her teens? \n\nIf she will do this once, and double down on it, do you really think this will be the last time? \n\nYWBTA if you don\u2019t find out wtf is wrong with your wife, my friend", "NTA. \n\nYour wife fully set Kayla up. She didn't play a \"prank\" on her, she WANTED to upset her. I'd be upset to if anyone in my life was like \"I had all the resources to get you the thing you asked for, but decided not to because you don't deserve it.\" You need to fully understand that your wife did exactly that. She didn't say they couldn't afford the laptop, or that it wouldn't come in time, or anything else, she was very explicit in making sure Kayla knew that you all had the money and decided not to get it for her. \n\nThen, she got pissed that Kayla reacted...exactly as anyone would react in that situation. So your wife wants the utmost respect and deference, while in that exact moment is being disrespectful and cruel for no reason. \n\nOf course you need to give Kayla the laptop, but more importantly you need to speak with your wife. Ask her WHY she pulled that prank. Ask her what she thought was funny about the prank. Ask her how she would feel if you did that to her. And make her answer, don't let her deflect or freak out. You need to understand why she thought this was something okay to do to her daughter- why did she want to see her upset or react in this way?

Pretty much everyone has a laptop - especially those who are studying. Honestly calling your wife a jerk would have been the minimum she would have gotten from me.", "NTA\n\nDon't usually respond to these things, but I hate bullies.  And continuing to pull pranks on someone after they've asked for it to stop is bullying.  The fact that it's a mother doing this to her own child is utterly abhorrent.

Your wife is a manipulative asshole. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThat \"prank\" wasn't funny at all.  \n\nTelling your 17 year old that she's \"not ready for a laptop\" is just plain foolish, and your wife's argument of \"what if we couldn't afford it\" falls flat if Kayla thought she was getting the equivalent value of a laptop in gift cards.\n\nKayla apologized to your wife as soon as she learned it was a \"prank\" and admitted that she was hurt by your wife's actions.

I got clothes too, but not nearly as many, and I knew the brands weren't nearly as expensive as my sisters.

But all of the presents were opened, and I was surrounded by clothes I would have never chosen for myself while my sister was having a blast. I went to my room and broke down by myself.\n\nMy mom found me crying, and flew into the biggest rage, going on and on about how ungrateful I am. About how rude and self-centered and evil I am. She demanded to know why I was crying but got more enraged at every answer I gave. Why couldn't at least be things I like? Why did Sister get so much more? Why did you ask me all those questions about it? I would give back all these clothes even for a little keyboard, can we try that?\n\nShe pulled the keyboard out of the coat closet. Full sized, weighted keys.\n\nAnd I didn't touch it for years.\n\nAnd I think about it every christmas.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "Bad parents are the ones who fuck up and then don't want to apologize to their kids.

Money\u2019s been tight, so my wife and I saved up to get it for her for Christmas. I couldn\u2019t wait to give it to her.\n\nThe other day, I come home from work and find Kayla upset, my wife in a mood and our son, Martin, (15) looking pleased. I asked my wife in private what was going on. She started venting to me that Kayla is an ungrateful brat, we should return her gift, etc. She then explained that she and our son decided to pull a small prank our daughter. \n\nMartin told Kayla that my wife had told him that instead of the laptop, she Kayla was getting the amount it\u2019d cost in gift cards to various stores (clothing, food, etc, not places you could buy a laptop), because she felt she wasn\u2019t ready for one. Kayla got very upset and asked my wife if this was true. My wife said yes and added \u201cmaybe next year\u201d. Kayla got upset and said this wasn\u2019t fair, she had only asked for one thing. Clearly money wasn\u2019t an issue. My wife admits she started laughing, which made Kayla even more upset and she told my wife she was a jerk. \n\nMy wife feels how Kayla reacted to the prank \u201cshowed her true colors\u201d and \u201cwhat if we couldn\u2019t afford it\u201d. I pointed out that we had told Kayla in the past that we couldn\u2019t afford it and she took it well. It seems that the issue was knowing we had the money and could\u2019ve bought it, but allegedly didn\u2019t. I asked her what she expected to come from this little prank and called her childish for roping Martin into it. I said I\u2019m not returning the laptop. My wife is mad at me and says Kayla needs to be punished.\n\nI also made my wife tell Kayla it was all a prank. Kayla apologized for calling my wife a jerk but said the prank was super hurtful. My wife refused to apologize and doubled down that she doesn\u2019t feel Kayla deserves it. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter doesn't matter enough to your wife for her to treat her better.\nWhat's worse is that instead of ignoring your daughter or being less involved (not saying neglect is ok), your wife has decided to go out of her way to be cruel over & over. Your daughter isn't being too sensitive.\n\nDo you realize your wife is emotionally & mentally abusing your son?\n She's roping him into participating in actively harming someone else. That's not healthy, normal adult behavior. She's actively putting him mentally & emotionally in between her, your daughter, & you. She's using him as a buffer & excuse. She's OK with him getting the brunt of that.
