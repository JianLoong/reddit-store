At first I thought it was a joke so I laughed. She is dead serious. I told her that is a fucking ridiculous name, and they are setting up their daughter for failure. My brother pulled me aside and said I was over reacting. My SIL and brother want me to apologize. I told them I would not apologize for stating a fact, that name is ridiculous.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit typo on name.\n\nEdit 2 I agree I could have been more diplomatic in my approach, this topic hits a tad close to home cause I was named after an extremely obscure animated character. Thankfully it was not well know growing up, so I did nor have many issues. As I got older the obscure nature kinda became less obscure especially in my line of work and circles. I get jokes for my name, but I am older and can take a joke. I think for kids it is 1000 times worse.\n\nThat said I 100% agree I should have shown more tact.\n\nEdit 3 My SIL does plan on it being a double name just like hers. She goes by her first and middle name, and she plans to do the same for her daughter. If it was just America I could see that, if it was Dream I could see that. The combo together especially with the intent to use it as a double name is what makes it ridiculous to imo.\n\nEdit 4 Thanks for all the replies did not expect to get so many, at this point many comments do much better to shed light. At this point I feel I am better off just showing them this post and letting fate take over.\n\nEdit 5 Tbh I had no idea about the mall, the wrestler, and the racing horse. After looking into the name more, I stand by my comments even if I am the asshole. At the very least I can say I tried. Going to have a heart to heart with my brother, cause I really doubt he is 100% for it.
