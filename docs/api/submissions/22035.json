I see an addiction counselor.\n\nLiving alone I don\u2019t feel the need to hide away the truth of my alcoholism anymore. I can just come home with a bottle of wine and nobody\u2019s there to judge me. It has actually meant I drink less overall. The shame fuels the drinking.\n\nWe had a wind storm and my recycling bin went on a little trip down the street. I grabbed it when I got home and had a laugh about it with my neighbor. There were the results of a bender and she asked if I had a party. I said no, this was just me. She said \u201cThey pick up the recycling every week, you don\u2019t have to keep it for so long.\u201d\n\nI said I know, this was just from the past week. She looked at the bin again and said \u201cOh, wow, okay.\u201d She asked did I need to talk to someone, etc. One of our other neighbors kinda misread the vibe and came out to join the conversation (which I\u2019m not mad about, this is that kind of neighborhood).\n\nI didn\u2019t want it to become a whole thing, so I said \u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic, you might see a lot of bottles from time to time.\u201d\n\nBoth women were really surprised, and the first one backed off and said that it was really disturbing that I would just come out and say it like that, like it was something I was proud of. I said that living in the shadows in a life of shame hurts, that it makes things worse, and that I choose to be honest about my addiction because I am not ashamed of who I am.\n\nShe said that alcoholism isn\u2019t something to make light of, or to glorify. I told her I would never glorify my addiction. She said that going around laughing about it flies in the face of everyone who has ever survived a life with alcoholic parents. I told her that I was sorry if that was her experience, genuinely.\n\nShe said if her kids wake up to see me passed out on the lawn, expect problems. Parading around here proud of being an alcoholic is trashy and they don\u2019t need that here.\n\nLater on, the 2nd neighbor came to see me and said that I had really upset the other woman. That I\u2019ve put a target on my back and that my attitude towards my illness will definitely rub a lot of people the wrong way. I said that I understand, but explained the thing about shame to her.

I wish you well.", "i can see why it would be shocking-- i've never heard someone say they're an alcoholic unless they were already sober, or on their path towards sobriety. the way you said it seems like you've just accepted it and you're gonna keep drinking. NTA for not feeling shame, but if you're going to talk about it so openly, you might want to include something about how you're in treatment or something that doesn't just make it sound like you're cool with it.", "I mean\u2026.soft YTA? You said it as if you\u2019re completely fine with being an alcoholic and have zero intentions of changing. Which isn\u2019t the same as saying \u201cI struggle with alcoholism but I\u2019m working on it\u201d", "INFO \n\nWhy would you not just say \u201cokay thanks!\u201d when your neighbor mentioned bringing the recycling out every week? That would have ended the conversation there. It seems like you wanted to have this conversation, whatever reaction it brought about. That\u2019s fine, and you\u2019re not TA for being honest about your addiction but it felt 100% purposeful to start a conversation that ended in an unsurprising way by responding the way you did. And when someone presents themselves as an unapologetically an addict (healthy and beneficial) without the addition that they are in treatment (healthy and beneficial), the implication even if this isn\u2019t true is that you aren\u2019t working to towards recovery (scary or concerning for neighbors who live next to you).", "NAH I sympathize with you but I would have reacted in a similar way to your neighbor because of my past experience with alcoholics. Binge drinking behavior, even just the evidence of it, elicits very strong emotional responses from people.", "So, I do think I'm gonna go with NAH. You're not ashamed to disclose your alcoholism, and that's great! You know yourself and your limits and know what you do and do not need.\n\nHowever, I also can see your neighbours' concerns with how you phrased things. Because, yeah, alcoholism can ruin lives more than anything and people have different experiences. Plus, I do think disclosing you having a counselor would have helped ease minds. As sucky as it is for alcoholics to be written off so quickly, you telling your neighbours that they may continue to see a whole bunch of bottles from time to time probably didn't help matters. For all they know (since they do not know you at all), you're an alcoholic who is NOT so fun when drunk and who may, as they put it, \"pass out on the lawn for all the kids to see.\" \n\nThey have very valid concerns. The way you're dealing with your alcoholism is fine since you have steps taken to limit the alcohol you drink, but they don't know that and there are more negatives to alcoholism that lead people to think worst case, which is also valid.\n\nSo since you're open with disclosing your alcoholism, I also would encourage disclosing you seeing someone about it. I do think that'll help your already fraying relationship with your neighbours.", "NTA. She asked. If I saw my neighbor had several bottles of alcohol in their own recycling bin it's none of my business. Maybe they are an alcoholic, maybe they had a party, maybe they had a bad week, not my business. It would only be my business if they did something on my property. You aren't parading around that you're an alcoholic.\n\nAll I can tell about your attitude towards it is that you are not denying it which is actually a good thing. I don't hope that you start to get help but it's not offensive to acknowledge your own shit.", "But do you want to actually quit drinking?", "NTA. But this is hardly an unexpected reaction. People don\u2019t openly talk about their alcoholism to neighbors they don\u2019t know well to avoid this exact thing.\n\nNot divulging personal stuff to neighbors is sensible, not necessarily fueled by shame. They know where you live, when you\u2019re home, etc., so you are vulnerable to whatever they might do with that information if they develop a grudge against you. They are already kind of threatening to call the police on you and now will watch you extra-closely, hoping for the chance to. They will not give you the benefit of the doubt in any situation. If they decide you\u2019re a potential threat to their kids, there is really no telling what they might do next. \n\nKeep things friendly with your neighbors whenever possible, but don\u2019t try to actually make friends with them unless or until you get to know them well enough to see if that would make any sense. Keep your politics and things people might judge you for like this to yourself.\n\nI suggest you go and apologize to the neighbor for mistakenly creating the impression that you are happily an alcoholic, rather than an alcoholic struggling to recover from your addiction. Mention your addiction counselor, etc. Even if you are thrilled to be an alcoholic, share that with your actual friends, not random neighbors.", "NAH\n\nI've seen many people struggle with alcoholism.  If someone were talking about it in a manner that seems as casual as you do; it would definitely dredge up the memories of all the pain it's caused people in my own life.  I might react similarly.\n\nBut you're also likely correct in that the shame itself can be a trigger, so your being open with it is actually part of your recovery.  I think you should talk about this with your addiction counselor and get their take.", "NTA -  Fellow alcoholic here. You have the right attitude, and your neighbours don't know what it's like. Keep doing you. I wish you the best.", "NTA. You don't owe them an explanation. They asked, you answered.  \nShe mentioned a target on your back? Wtf does that mean? Was that a threat? If take it as such and report them.", "NTA. \n\nBut, I can see that being kind of flippant as well.  \n\nLike, imagine if they saw a bunch of people leaving, and you were like \"nope, I'm just a sex addict.  I had an orgy.  You may see that from time to time\". \n\nIts a bit TMI.  That said, it was your business to tell, and if you wanted to share that, its your choice.", "NTA you were making light of the situation, plus humor is how some people cope. I think it brings awareness and it shows you\u2019re self aware. She probably had some anger built up over the years with similar situations and finally found someone she could take it out on. Good luck on your journey", "**NTA**\n\nNeither neighbor needed to comment on your trash/recycling in the first place. People need to keep their thoughts to themselves. I'm sorry this happened to you. But unfortunately, there are always going to be those people who demonize addicts and refuse to understand.", "She's policing how you deal with your own addiction? That is astonishing nerve, haha. NTA and good for you for recognizing that shame feeds this. All the best to you.", "NTA. Your neighbor should have been minding her own business. However, going forward, I do think it might be beneficial to word it a different way. Some other people in the comments have made great suggestions, and while there's nothing to be ashamed of, and alcoholism is far more common than people like to admit, exposing it to others in a less shocking way may ease the tension.", "NTA...It's about doing the best you can on any given day.  Some days your best will not be as good as others. You need support, not judgement.", "NTA. \n\nObviously, ideally you get into recovery. \n\nBut one of the features of life in a civilization is that people feel free to judge you for your weaknesses while pretending their own are trivial.", "NTA. You are seeking help for your addiction and you may choose to handle your own mental health as you see fit. I suspect she has her own trauma around alcoholism and that this really wasn't about you. I don't think you did anything wrong here, and I wish you the best health for you moving forward.", "NTA, but maybe because I'm used to alcoholics, my country literally takes pride in being one of the biggest consumers of beer in the world, so idk", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For a long time I felt like it would save time to put my cards out on the table and weed out the people who weren\u2019t going to end up liking me anyway. However, I\u2019ve come to realize that people are much more willing to accept behaviour that\u2019s different from their own if they already have a bond with the person. I\u2019d been weeding out people unnecessarily. I do it way less now and things have gotten way better.\n\nYou put this lady in an awkward position where most people wouldn\u2019t know what to say. It happens, but that\u2019s a social nightmare for a lot of folks, and when their anxiety goes up and it\u2019s related to you, they will like you less. If that matters to you, it\u2019s good to have a social lubricant handy, like acknowledging how unusual the conversation is. \n\nIt\u2019s also clear from her reaction that she was misjudging your emotions about it. Your lack of discomfort was coming across as amusement. She also clearly has preconceived notions about how alcoholics act. You didn\u2019t do much to disabuse her of these ideas. That\u2019s absolutely fine to not want to spend the time defending yourself, but then you can\u2019t complain when she still feels that way. \n\nAnd lastly, you do have a disease that almost always manifests in anti-social behaviour.

You're control over the issue is imagined and it's going to take one bad night for it to become your neighbors problem.

Some people need to joke about things because it's a laugh or cry situation, and laughing is easier to deal with than crying. As long as you're not driving through the neighborhood drunk or causing your neighbors issues, you should be able to live your life how you want. To me, being honest is better.

Thing is people will gossip no matter what, so you took the wind out of her sails. Addiction is worse with shame, and you know yourself enough to know that it makes your situation worse. By being honest you have also given yourself more accountability in the neighbourhood.", "NTA. There comes a certain sense of strength when you're able to admit it without shame. Next month, I'll be 16 years clean from opiates. I STILL see my addiction therapist and probably always will. During the height of my addiction, I was ashamed and told no one. Once I sought help and began to get better, it brought me inner strength to say it aloud without shame. That's not the same thing as being proud of your addiction.\n\n When I was still dating, I told those I dated about my addiction and therapy because I didn't want to be judged harshly if it were to come out after keeping it a secret.

It's your life, you're under no moral obligation to hide it or keep it secret just to make others more comfortable. \n\nAs others said, it might have been helpful to add \"I'm getting help\" somewhere in your explanation, but I don't think that would satisfy your neighbor.

Alcoholics attract it like a magnet.", "Well, it seems like you unintentionally turned your neighbor\u2019s world into a sobering experience! Remember, humor can be a cope, but it's crucial to consider the impact it might have on others. Maybe it's time to pour out a heartfelt apology and have a sober conversation with your neighbor to clarify your intentions. Cheers to understanding and fixing relationships!", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but you\u2019re strange. You\u2019re strange. I think you know that. You\u2019re going to make things difficult for yourself by over sharing.\n\nNo one wants to meet their neighbour and the first thing they hear is about their alcoholism. You would just write that person off. Any normal person would.", "NAH, you have probably really surprised your neighbours, not knowing any of their history or knowledge of alcoholism. You have shared a very personal struggle that you are still in the middle of, and my advice is to be careful of who you share this special information with - you cannot retract it. . You shared you information and they told you their opinion of it and it sounds like they have family with alcoholism which may not be very funny to them.\n\nOP as someone who has been sober 11 years, let me tell you why I don't tell so many people I'm an alcoholic and spoiler alert it's not because I'm ashamed.\n\n1 it's fun for people to want to ask but cant. Because I live in a country where there is a lot of drinking, I still go to pubs and social occasions where there is drinking. I can tell that at times (a few) people are desperate to know why I don't drink but out of social politeness and etiquette they don't, and I find that entertaining.\n\n2. People don't want to risk you relapse or spoil their fun. Because generally people care about me, those closest to me know and know that I don't really give a shit who drinks in front of me this is is not an issue. However in my time I have realised it is other new people that might feel they don't know how to handle the situation, they don't want to drink around me or I'm worried that they won't relax around me and I can tell even really lovely people initially don't know what to say or do when I bring it up and I spend some time placating them and assuring them it is totally fine for them to drink around me. It's good in some ways that they do this - they don't want me to relapse, you wouldn't smoke crack in front of someone with a crack addiction right? \n\n3. My sobriety is less relevant. I have amazing work colleagues but work mostly remotely. We have met up when they have drunk and my supervisor quite drunk.

Genetics can predispose you by influencing how you react to alcohol or other drugs and it may even have some effect on impulse control which can definitely contribute. However many people with the genetic predisposition will not develop an addiction, since they didn\u2019t have the same behavior shaping experiences that lead others to be addicts. There may be people on the far ends of the scale where the genetic or environmental effect is the exclusive cause, but the vast majority of people who suffer from addiction fall somewhere in the middle.

You don\u2019t know what that info means to different people.

So there\u2019s just no need to insist on telling people so you can feel \u201cless shame\u201d when it may have unintended negative consequences on them and/or you. You don\u2019t need to feel shame. You\u2019ve acknowledged the problem and are addressing it. Not everyone you meet needs to also acknowledge the problem for you to not feel shame. Their ignorance of what you\u2019re going through shouldn\u2019t make you feel shameful. Friends and family should know, that\u2019s important info that effects how they interact with you.

While your neighbors should not have gotten hostile about your battle, it is also true that your illness will destroy you, and that you are not in recovery. \n\nProbably the main thing people worry about is if you drink and drive.

He was another shining star that blew up, or do we thought. It turns out that Downey\u2019s father was an alcoholic and a drug addict, who forced him to do drugs at 6 years old. By 11 he was heavily addicted. By 18 he was hopeless, but heel-toeing it through Hollywood. \n\nWhen he got out of prison, he couldn\u2019t find a job. He was radioactive. It was Mel Gibson who stood by him. He gave him a place to live, food to eat, and he counseled him to find faith. It didn\u2019t have to be any particular faith, just one rooted in forgiveness. He told him to \u201chug the cactus\u201d, to embrace and forgive all the regretful, embarrassing, ugly things he\u2019d done, and to forgive himself. He even gave up one of his own movie roles so he\u2019d have a job back in Hollywood. Robert Downey, He\u2019s best years, best acting, best roles, and best moments have been after prison. His best years were ahead of him, but at his darkest, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it. \n\nThat relative among the in-laws I mentioned- he had trash like yours. Filled with bottles. He\u2019d chuckle over his drinking, while everyone else worried. He got sober in his 70s, when people said it was hopeless. I went to the funeral of another friend where the church was packed to the rafters. He had been in liver failure due to alcoholism decades before, got clean and sober, and paid it forward, mentoring scores of people over the years. Saving lives as his had been saved. \n\nThe problem here, as I see it, is that you need a real support network. These neighbors are acquaintances, not close friends.

An addict won\u2019t change until they\u2019re ready to change, shaming them won\u2019t do anything but make problems worse-and let them know you\u2019re not safe to go to. Addiction does NOT equate to morality. Look at all these coffee drinkers who can\u2019t go a day without a couple cups without hellish withdrawal symptoms. Migraines, the \u2018jitters\u2019, that\u2019s withdrawal. That\u2019s an addiction, but they\u2019re not evil for it nor does society act that way.

But since women make up half the population yes, I would say its safe to assume barring some extreme abuse/ isolation that everyone has had contact with a woman.", ">The neighbors don't know OP.\n\nSo maybe they shouldn't have pressed the issue with her if they didn't want to hear about it.

But man, the neighbor was super out of line by even asking personal questions about OP\u2019s garbage in the first place. My neighbors garbage and recycling have been blown into my yard from heavy winds before and I didn\u2019t sit there snooping through their shit to find out what they\u2019re into.

Taking the shame out of the situation is a good thing.\n\nHowever, you may want to be sensitive and conscious of the needs of others. There are many people who have negative experiences with people with substance use disorders. They may by projecting these experiences onto you, whether they are aware of it or not. The number of people who have lost a loved one to drinking and driving, or have experienced violence/theft/chaos as a result of an addiction is substantial. \n\nYou shouldn't feel shame, but you need to a) be aware that fear and judgment may be a result of sharing this information, and b) be conscious that you are not over-sharing. This can protect yourself from unfair assumptions and judgments, and prevent fear and distrust in others. \n\nI'd advise you to share your experience with addiction in the same way you would any other sensitive medical issue - in a safe place for you and others. I don't tell people I don't know well or feel safe with about, say, my history of anxiety or depression, miscarriage and infertility, surgery that went septic, the time I almost died in a car accident, etc. (as random examples). To a relative stranger, this would be over-sharing, TMI, or even trauma-dumping.
