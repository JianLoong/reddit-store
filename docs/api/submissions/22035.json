It\u2019s in an okay neighborhood. Lots of people with young kids and all that American dream stuff. I am also an alcoholic.

I see an addiction counselor.\n\nLiving alone I don\u2019t feel the need to hide away the truth of my alcoholism anymore. I can just come home with a bottle of wine and nobody\u2019s there to judge me. It has actually meant I drink less overall. The shame fuels the drinking.\n\nWe had a wind storm and my recycling bin went on a little trip down the street. I grabbed it when I got home and had a laugh about it with my neighbor. There were the results of a bender and she asked if I had a party. I said no, this was just me. She said \u201cThey pick up the recycling every week, you don\u2019t have to keep it for so long.\u201d\n\nI said I know, this was just from the past week. She looked at the bin again and said \u201cOh, wow, okay.\u201d She asked did I need to talk to someone, etc. One of our other neighbors kinda misread the vibe and came out to join the conversation (which I\u2019m not mad about, this is that kind of neighborhood).\n\nI didn\u2019t want it to become a whole thing, so I said \u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic, you might see a lot of bottles from time to time.\u201d\n\nBoth women were really surprised, and the first one backed off and said that it was really disturbing that I would just come out and say it like that, like it was something I was proud of. I said that living in the shadows in a life of shame hurts, that it makes things worse, and that I choose to be honest about my addiction because I am not ashamed of who I am.\n\nShe said that alcoholism isn\u2019t something to make light of, or to glorify. I told her I would never glorify my addiction. She said that going around laughing about it flies in the face of everyone who has ever survived a life with alcoholic parents. I told her that I was sorry if that was her experience, genuinely.\n\nShe said if her kids wake up to see me passed out on the lawn, expect problems. Parading around here proud of being an alcoholic is trashy and they don\u2019t need that here.\n\nLater on, the 2nd neighbor came to see me and said that I had really upset the other woman. That I\u2019ve put a target on my back and that my attitude towards my illness will definitely rub a lot of people the wrong way. I said that I understand, but explained the thing about shame to her.

I wish you well.", "i can see why it would be shocking-- i've never heard someone say they're an alcoholic unless they were already sober, or on their path towards sobriety. the way you said it seems like you've just accepted it and you're gonna keep drinking. NTA for not feeling shame, but if you're going to talk about it so openly, you might want to include something about how you're in treatment or something that doesn't just make it sound like you're cool with it.", "I mean\u2026.soft YTA? You said it as if you\u2019re completely fine with being an alcoholic and have zero intentions of changing. Which isn\u2019t the same as saying \u201cI struggle with alcoholism but I\u2019m working on it\u201d", "INFO \n\nWhy would you not just say \u201cokay thanks!\u201d when your neighbor mentioned bringing the recycling out every week? That would have ended the conversation there. It seems like you wanted to have this conversation, whatever reaction it brought about. That\u2019s fine, and you\u2019re not TA for being honest about your addiction but it felt 100% purposeful to start a conversation that ended in an unsurprising way by responding the way you did. And when someone presents themselves as an unapologetically an addict (healthy and beneficial) without the addition that they are in treatment (healthy and beneficial), the implication even if this isn\u2019t true is that you aren\u2019t working to towards recovery (scary or concerning for neighbors who live next to you).", "NAH I sympathize with you but I would have reacted in a similar way to your neighbor because of my past experience with alcoholics. Binge drinking behavior, even just the evidence of it, elicits very strong emotional responses from people.", "So, I do think I'm gonna go with NAH. You're not ashamed to disclose your alcoholism, and that's great! You know yourself and your limits and know what you do and do not need.\n\nHowever, I also can see your neighbours' concerns with how you phrased things. Because, yeah, alcoholism can ruin lives more than anything and people have different experiences. Plus, I do think disclosing you having a counselor would have helped ease minds. As sucky as it is for alcoholics to be written off so quickly, you telling your neighbours that they may continue to see a whole bunch of bottles from time to time probably didn't help matters. For all they know (since they do not know you at all), you're an alcoholic who is NOT so fun when drunk and who may, as they put it, \"pass out on the lawn for all the kids to see.\" \n\nThey have very valid concerns. The way you're dealing with your alcoholism is fine since you have steps taken to limit the alcohol you drink, but they don't know that and there are more negatives to alcoholism that lead people to think worst case, which is also valid.\n\nSo since you're open with disclosing your alcoholism, I also would encourage disclosing you seeing someone about it. I do think that'll help your already fraying relationship with your neighbours.", "NTA. She asked. If I saw my neighbor had several bottles of alcohol in their own recycling bin it's none of my business. Maybe they are an alcoholic, maybe they had a party, maybe they had a bad week, not my business. It would only be my business if they did something on my property. You aren't parading around that you're an alcoholic.\n\nAll I can tell about your attitude towards it is that you are not denying it which is actually a good thing. I don't hope that you start to get help but it's not offensive to acknowledge your own shit.", "But do you want to actually quit drinking?", "NTA. But this is hardly an unexpected reaction. People don\u2019t openly talk about their alcoholism to neighbors they don\u2019t know well to avoid this exact thing.\n\nNot divulging personal stuff to neighbors is sensible, not necessarily fueled by shame. They know where you live, when you\u2019re home, etc., so you are vulnerable to whatever they might do with that information if they develop a grudge against you. They are already kind of threatening to call the police on you and now will watch you extra-closely, hoping for the chance to. They will not give you the benefit of the doubt in any situation. If they decide you\u2019re a potential threat to their kids, there is really no telling what they might do next. \n\nKeep things friendly with your neighbors whenever possible, but don\u2019t try to actually make friends with them unless or until you get to know them well enough to see if that would make any sense. Keep your politics and things people might judge you for like this to yourself.\n\nI suggest you go and apologize to the neighbor for mistakenly creating the impression that you are happily an alcoholic, rather than an alcoholic struggling to recover from your addiction. Mention your addiction counselor, etc. Even if you are thrilled to be an alcoholic, share that with your actual friends, not random neighbors.", "NAH\n\nI've seen many people struggle with alcoholism.  If someone were talking about it in a manner that seems as casual as you do; it would definitely dredge up the memories of all the pain it's caused people in my own life.  I might react similarly.\n\nBut you're also likely correct in that the shame itself can be a trigger, so your being open with it is actually part of your recovery.  I think you should talk about this with your addiction counselor and get their take.", "NTA -  Fellow alcoholic here. You have the right attitude, and your neighbours don't know what it's like. Keep doing you. I wish you the best.", "NTA. You don't owe them an explanation. They asked, you answered.  \nShe mentioned a target on your back? Wtf does that mean? Was that a threat? If take it as such and report them.", "NTA. \n\nBut, I can see that being kind of flippant as well.  \n\nLike, imagine if they saw a bunch of people leaving, and you were like \"nope, I'm just a sex addict.  I had an orgy.  You may see that from time to time\". \n\nIts a bit TMI.  That said, it was your business to tell, and if you wanted to share that, its your choice.", "NTA you were making light of the situation, plus humor is how some people cope. I think it brings awareness and it shows you\u2019re self aware. She probably had some anger built up over the years with similar situations and finally found someone she could take it out on. Good luck on your journey", "**NTA**\n\nNeither neighbor needed to comment on your trash/recycling in the first place. People need to keep their thoughts to themselves. I'm sorry this happened to you. But unfortunately, there are always going to be those people who demonize addicts and refuse to understand.", "She's policing how you deal with your own addiction? That is astonishing nerve, haha. NTA and good for you for recognizing that shame feeds this. All the best to you.", "NTA. Your neighbor should have been minding her own business. However, going forward, I do think it might be beneficial to word it a different way. Some other people in the comments have made great suggestions, and while there's nothing to be ashamed of, and alcoholism is far more common than people like to admit, exposing it to others in a less shocking way may ease the tension.", "NTA...It's about doing the best you can on any given day.  Some days your best will not be as good as others. You need support, not judgement.", "NTA. \n\nObviously, ideally you get into recovery. \n\nBut one of the features of life in a civilization is that people feel free to judge you for your weaknesses while pretending their own are trivial.", "NTA. You are seeking help for your addiction and you may choose to handle your own mental health as you see fit. I suspect she has her own trauma around alcoholism and that this really wasn't about you. I don't think you did anything wrong here, and I wish you the best health for you moving forward.", "NTA, but maybe because I'm used to alcoholics, my country literally takes pride in being one of the biggest consumers of beer in the world, so idk", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For a long time I felt like it would save time to put my cards out on the table and weed out the people who weren\u2019t going to end up liking me anyway. However, I\u2019ve come to realize that people are much more willing to accept behaviour that\u2019s different from their own if they already have a bond with the person. I\u2019d been weeding out people unnecessarily. I do it way less now and things have gotten way better.\n\nYou put this lady in an awkward position where most people wouldn\u2019t know what to say. It happens, but that\u2019s a social nightmare for a lot of folks, and when their anxiety goes up and it\u2019s related to you, they will like you less. If that matters to you, it\u2019s good to have a social lubricant handy, like acknowledging how unusual the conversation is. \n\nIt\u2019s also clear from her reaction that she was misjudging your emotions about it. Your lack of discomfort was coming across as amusement. She also clearly has preconceived notions about how alcoholics act. You didn\u2019t do much to disabuse her of these ideas. That\u2019s absolutely fine to not want to spend the time defending yourself, but then you can\u2019t complain when she still feels that way. \n\nAnd lastly, you do have a disease that almost always manifests in anti-social behaviour.

You're control over the issue is imagined and it's going to take one bad night for it to become your neighbors problem.

The fact they are judging alcoholics so hard doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA\n\nSome people just want to be offended. Some people need to joke about things because it's a laugh or cry situation, and laughing is easier to deal with than crying. As long as you're not driving through the neighborhood drunk or causing your neighbors issues, you should be able to live your life how you want. To me, being honest is better.

It may be uncomfortable or scary to her to have someone like that in her neighborhood. NTA for being honest and not feeling shame, but you may want to try and patch this up.", "NTA\n\nSure - if you pass out drunk on your front lawn, or drive whilst drunk, you'd be an asshole, but we're not talking about that.

And I'm sure all the neighbors will be terrified you'll drive drunk. \n\nThe fact you haven't thought of how this could impact other people who have to live near you says a lot!", "NTA\n\nGood for you OP for being honest. Thing is people will gossip no matter what, so you took the wind out of her sails. Addiction is worse with shame, and you know yourself enough to know that it makes your situation worse. By being honest you have also given yourself more accountability in the neighbourhood.", "NTA. There comes a certain sense of strength when you're able to admit it without shame. Next month, I'll be 16 years clean from opiates. I STILL see my addiction therapist and probably always will. During the height of my addiction, I was ashamed and told no one. Once I sought help and began to get better, it brought me inner strength to say it aloud without shame. That's not the same thing as being proud of your addiction.\n\n When I was still dating, I told those I dated about my addiction and therapy because I didn't want to be judged harshly if it were to come out after keeping it a secret.

It's your life, you're under no moral obligation to hide it or keep it secret just to make others more comfortable. \n\nAs others said, it might have been helpful to add \"I'm getting help\" somewhere in your explanation, but I don't think that would satisfy your neighbor.

And yes, even if you don\u2019t now, eventually there will be huge drama around you.  Alcoholics attract it like a magnet.", "Well, it seems like you unintentionally turned your neighbor\u2019s world into a sobering experience! Remember, humor can be a cope, but it's crucial to consider the impact it might have on others. Maybe it's time to pour out a heartfelt apology and have a sober conversation with your neighbor to clarify your intentions. Cheers to understanding and fixing relationships!", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but you\u2019re strange. You\u2019re strange. I think you know that. You\u2019re going to make things difficult for yourself by over sharing.\n\nNo one wants to meet their neighbour and the first thing they hear is about their alcoholism. You would just write that person off. Any normal person would.", "NAH, you have probably really surprised your neighbours, not knowing any of their history or knowledge of alcoholism. You have shared a very personal struggle that you are still in the middle of, and my advice is to be careful of who you share this special information with - you cannot retract it. . You shared you information and they told you their opinion of it and it sounds like they have family with alcoholism which may not be very funny to them.\n\nOP as someone who has been sober 11 years, let me tell you why I don't tell so many people I'm an alcoholic and spoiler alert it's not because I'm ashamed.\n\n1 it's fun for people to want to ask but cant. Because I live in a country where there is a lot of drinking, I still go to pubs and social occasions where there is drinking. I can tell that at times people are desperate to know why I don't drink but out of social politeness and etiquette they don't, and I find that entertaining.\n\n2. People don't want to risk you relapse or spoil their fun. Because generally people care about me, those closest to me know and know that I don't really give a shit who drinks in front of me this is is not an issue. However in my time I have realised it is other new people that might feel they don't know how to handle the situation, they don't want to drink around me or I'm worried that they won't relax around me and I can tell even really lovely people initially don't know what to say or do when I bring it up and I spend some time placating them and assuring them it is totally fine for them to drink around me. It's good in some ways that they do this - they don't want me to relapse, you wouldn't smoke crack in front of someone with a crack addiction right? \n\n3. My sobriety is less relevant. I have amazing work colleagues but work mostly remotely. We have met up when they have drunk and my supervisor quite drunk. I thought I would tell them but it just never came up to be honest and just wasn't relevant. Im not ashamed and they are all super woke so it wouldn't be an issue if anything I might get brownie points, it's just not relevant at this time. When it is relevant, for example if there was a conversation on addictions or if I needed to I would.\n\n4. People worry. In contrary to what I have said above also I work in a high stress environment and get to go to some exciting places. I know my abilities and stressor etc and would not do anythjng to jepordise my sobriety. However, not everyone else does! And I don't want to miss out on shit because of their misplaced protection of me. \n\n5. People in sobriety are vulnerable. In the UK being in recovery can even be classified as a sort of disability.  For me, for example, I would not date anyone in early sobriety and woulld have to set boundaries if it was a new friend.  Would you have joked about being recently assaulted is abused?", "Who cares about the neighbor, but get some real help. Nothing good is going to come ffrom rationalizing your problem. Saying you live alone so there\u2019s less shame, saying you are seeing a counselor are both making it seem like youre trying, but it comes across more as excuse making.", "NTA ! I can see how your neighbors might have been surprised by your bluntness, but they had no right to be so judgy.  I mean I guess they need to be told that when you discuss a persons garbage and  recycling you might find stuff out! Your neighbors, especially the pearl clutches sound like the assholes! \nI bet the neighbors have their own addictions and skeletons etc.", "Yeah, exactly. OP is NTA for saying they\u2019re an alcoholic but I would for sure be weirded out if my neighbor was just like \u201cwelp I might be on a bender at any time so deal with it lol\u201d.", "The 2nd paragraph is exactly it, if you haven\u2019t lived with an alcoholic the honesty may seem brave", ">'ve never heard someone say they're an alcoholic unless they were already sober, or on their path towards sobriety.\n\nIt's a new movement in addiction management. My brother goes to a psychiatrist for his drinking, and my best friend goes to an addictions therapist. Neither of them are ready to quit totally, so they developed management plans and rules with their councilors. Both openly admit to being alcoholics. It's nothing to be ashamed of.", "Yeah OP should\u2019ve told the neighbor that they were seeing an addiction counselor when she asked if they needed to talk to anyone and that whole interaction probably would\u2019ve went very differently", "How is that any of their business? The neighbour asked multiple prying questions about OP's drinking when they were just trying to take their recycling out. The neighbour was literally looking through OP's trash and then demanding an explanation for the trash. It is none of the neighbours business how OP relates to their alcoholism.", "OP doesn\u2019t owe his nosy neighbors an explanation. If OP is ok being an alcoholic, that\u2019s his business. His neighbors should mind theirs.", "I don't think OP's phrasing makes them at all an asshole, soft YTA or not.", "It just didn't occur to me to say that, honestly. If it had, maybe I would have said that. It just felt natural to be like \"yeah, I know\"", "This is the best answer of the bunch. While OP didn't have to lie per se, they also didn't need to get the conversation to the point where they had to be honest.", "Doesn't really sound like it from the post. The other woman probably reacted so strongly because of her past experiences, and honestly, I've seen OP's attitude from other addicts in my work.\n\nThey like the honesty because it's a way of alleviating guilt without having to actually change any behaviors.\n\nThis woman is expecting the worst from OP, but I can't really blame her. Even trusting someone in long-term recovery can be extremely difficult, and OP is still actively using alcohol.", "If I didn't, I wouldn't voluntarily be in addiction counseling.", "Who cares if OP wants to quit drinking? That's up to OP, not anyone else.", "I think what she meant was OP is going to become the neighborhood pariah. For example, whenever something bad happens in the neighborhood, the cops will be directed to OP or OP\u2019s house will one the neighborhood kids are told to avoid on Halloween, stuff like that. To be clear, I\u2019m not defending the statement. I\u2019m just explaining what the neighbor probably meant.", "she isnt policing him, she reacted to him announcing that he was an alcoholic, if i was in a neighborhood with kids i definitely wouldnt want an alcoholic living on the block", "OP said nothing about dealing with their addiction. They just said expect to see more bottles in the future. \n\nThey are being judged for being flippant about excessive drinking- something that causes issues frequently for other people who have to live nearby, drive the same streets etc.", "NTA. My best wishes for your recovery.", "Nah, OP is just trying to normalize a super common illness.", "They're wet towels and losers because they aren't alcoholics? Wow. I'm going to guess you are one.", "Ha, I haven't passed out in a public place since college. It took one time for me to learn that lesson.\n\nI do think it's worth adding that I don't drive. I've never even gotten my permit, so I don't have a car. Of course, my neighbors may not have realized that since I have a garage.", "I have zero interest in why non-drinkers don't drink. Who cares?  Maybe it's for health, maybe they have addiction issues, maybe they don't like the taste. \n\nI think you're wildly overestimating people\u2019s level of interest in what you're doing.", "What would you recommend over seeing a licensed professional who has 20+ years of experience treating substance abuse patients? I can't think of something that would be more beneficial to treating it, especially anything evidence-based.", "That\u2019s not what OP did though. They simply stated that they are an alcoholic and they might see \u201ca lot of bottles from time to time.\u201d Nothing OP said was joking about their addiction, making light of, or glorifying it.\n\nETA: with the exception of weather moving the bin again, the only way neighbor would even see the bottles is if she is nosy and goes looking.", "It's fine to share with loved ones but addicts effect the people around them. They need to show they're aware of that. \n\nIn this case OP didn't tell the neighbors they're in treatment but instead made it seem like they fully plan to keep binge drinking.", "I understand it may be healthy for recovery to think that way, but being an alcoholic is absolutely something to be ashamed of.", "So your good with the closet alcoholics that live in your area.", "I agree, none of this is the neighbor's business so long as OP isn't hurting/disturbing others with her drinking. The neighbor kind of sounds like she kept pushing the issue (\"You must have had a party,\" \"They pick up the recycling every week\") just to get OP to say something that she could be offended by.", "Sure he doesn\u2019t. But if he doesn\u2019t give an explanation and instead offers a statement that can easily be interpreted as flippancy about a serious topic, it\u2019s not surprising or necessarily wrong of people who can be negatively impacted by the anti-social behavior of an addict to assume the worst.", "I mean, that\u2019s fine. But here\u2019s the thing about honesty as it relates to addiction. If you are going to be honest you either have to prepare for conversations like this to ensure that your intentions are communicated correctly or, unfortunately, you can\u2019t be surprised when people take your perceived flippancy as a sign that you\u2019re not treating it as seriously as you should and have concerns. \u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic so you\u2019ll be being a lot of bottles sometimes\u201d can easily be read as \u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic with no intention of stopping\u201d if you don\u2019t include that you\u2019re in treatment. And that\u2019s scary to parents of young children when almost all substance addiction results in some form of anti-social behavior that could negatively impact your neighbors.", "The 2nd paragraph is exactly it, if you haven\u2019t lived with an alcoholic the honesty may seem brave, but it\u2019s just another way they justify, and there\u2019s usually a family member or friend suffering from the addicts choice", "I think this is the problem here, the casual \"it is what it is\" attitude like it's no big deal to be an alcoholic. It IS a big deal, definitely not something to glorify or be proud of. Alcoholism wrecks lives. The people in this neighborhood probably want to make sure there isn't someone drunk behind the wheel on their streets, especially if they  have kids.", "Why didn\u2019t you say \u201cI am seeing a counselor\u201d when your neighbor asked if you wanted to see someone?", "Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to have the attitude of \"well I am in counseling, and hypothetically I could be drinking more than I am now, so the drinking I'm doing is ok\" - or am I being unfair?", "And the first time hes on a bender and falls asleep out on lawn in his underwear, cops will be called within 5 min", "Unfortunately, there probably is an alcoholic living on most blocks. Or addict of *some* kind. Especially with the opiate crisis in America right now.", "Alcoholics have to live somewhere. As long as OP keeps it in his house, who are the neighbors to decide who can and can\u2019t live there.", "Nah they are those things for being gossipy and judgy.\n\nAnd yeah, I drink. Not excessively but wtf would it matrer?", "Indeed my 11 years of sobriety has taught me nothing. And it's not everyone only a few but it tickles me.", "I took it as more like \u201cwelp, I\u2019m an alcoholic what can you do\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d, which feels like making light of it? And also I thought the neighbor saw the bottles bc the wind knocked the trash over?\n\nEither way, they\u2019re NTA for their addiction but I can see why the neighbors were weirded out", "Have you lived near someone with a drinking problem?  Especially someone who doesn't seem to be dealing with it? \n\nOP says yep they drink too much & expect to continue doing so tells the neighbors they can look forward to possible: erratic behavior, drunk driving near their families, possible violence and aggression.", "That's exactly what OP did though...", "why is having an illness something to be ashamed of? is having depression something to be ashamed of? an eating disorder?", "That\u2019s absolutely harsh.  There\u2019s a lot people should be ashamed of.  Like judging people.", "Addiction is a disease, not a moral failing. Do you tell cancer patients they should be ashamed?", ">but being an alcoholic is absolutely something to be ashamed of.\n\nYou're wrong. Do you think chronic depression is something to be ashamed of? Should people with severe anxiety be ashamed? What about people schizophrenia? These are just conditions people have and feeling shame does not help them. Addiction is no different.", "Errrr fuck you", "It's a completely counterintuitive approach to hide and be ashamed of being an alcoholic when part of recovery is admitting and owning up to having a problem. Societal attitudes towards addiction do far more harm than good in helping others recover.", "I am. Unless they're on my property or on the road then it is none of my business. Everybody has their own struggles. What are we gonna do, drive every wine and Xanax mom out of the United States? Walk around breathalizing all of my neighbors every night? Shaming addicts clearly has no benefit, it is an illness.", "> the casual \"it is what it is\" attitude\n\nOP said they see an addictions councilor. They don't have an 'it is what it is attitude'. OP is just refusing to be ashamed of something that isn't their fault.\n\n>want to make sure there isn't someone drunk behind the wheel on their streets\n\nNot all alcoholics are drunk drivers, and it's offensive that you think that.", "I paraphrased the interaction for brevity/character limit, but it was kind of a barrage of comments/talking from her to where I didn't have a place to say anything until after my other neighbor made her way over. Kind of like a \"do you need to see anyone? My cousin's best friend's uncle's wife's nutritionist's dog's vet's little sister saw someone and I heard that there's an AA meeting in a church basement a few miles away and...\"", "The attitude is \"I am in counseling and making a lot of progress, that's great.\"", "Just out here sunbathing, ON MY OWN DAMN PROPERTY!!!", "I live next door to one. He drives drunk and is a danger to our neighborhood. I'm not saying you do things that affect your neighbors while you are drunk, but people may be concerned that you will. You shouldn't be ashamed of your disease but being flippant about it could scare people a little.", "yeah i dont want my crackhead neighbor walking up and talking to me about how he uses crack and isnt ashamed of it, its pretty much the same thing, and people are right to be concerned about any addicts that live near them, because addicts are known to do immoral things for their addictions, if my neighbor said he was an alcoholic i would make sure to keep my kids as far away as possible", "That's possible we all have a neighbor or two with issues. But if they're able to keep it under wraps they have some handle on it. \n\nMost people would either keep their addiction private from people they don't know but live next to or they'd reassure neighbors that it's a struggle they are being treated for. \n\nWould you want a meth addict next door?  One that openly tells you they plan on continuing using?  Alcohol can be just as destructive.", "they arent deciding who lives there and who doesnt, they are judging a self admitted alcoholic, i dont blame them at all", "That\u2019s not what OP said. As a matter of fact, the bender (to use OP\u2019s words) had already happened with no notice of \u201cerratic behavior, drunk driving near their families, possible violence and aggression.\u201d You\u2019re making assumptions. \n\nI grew up with alcoholic parents, so yes I am familiar. None of us have any idea what OP is doing to deal with their addiction.

OP saying they'll continue to binge drink and making it seem like no big deal should expect judgment.", "Yes...", "Are you ashamed for judging me?", "Well with addiction there is at least an element of choice involved, not so (directly) with cancer.

Concern is normal, it's called parenting.", "I get that, but as I said in my other comment you need to prepare to have these conversations to ensure that they go the way you intend them to.
