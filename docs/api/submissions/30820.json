Mature adults know that this is not how relationships work.\n\nHe sounds emotionally immature, and the fact that he has 'decided' these things for you, even though it makes you uncomfortable, worries me.  \n\nThese comments & his behaviour are a forest of red flags.

He is being controlling and a massive creep. He doesn't own you. You're not his. You've said no. Cut him off before something worse happens.", "NTA and he's got classic male emotional blindness.  The fact you showed him any compassion at all as a friend has confused him into thinking you're partners.  You say that you don't want to hurt his feelings -- okay, so explain to him that human beings help and care for each other, even when they are not partners, and he needs to understand the difference.  You are not able or willing or interested in giving him what he needs, and you would love him to find a partner more suited for him.  But he needs to take a massive step back and understand that these \"protective\" behaviors are undermining your autonomy as a person, and that shit don't fly between friends.

Do not let this person turn you into a statistic.", "NTA\n\nI don't think that he was persuading you to go out with him, but rather he was manipulating you to go out with him.  If you're agitated, annoyed, or otherwise uncomfortable with his behavior, you need to just stop spending time with him and feeding his attachment issues.\n\nIt is important to note that it is NOT your responsibility to make other people happy.  It is NOT your job to make this guy feel better.  Good on you for being a kind person who wanted to help a wounded bird.... But you need to work on creating boundaries, and controlling expectations.", "NTA\n\nGuys like this rely on your desire to be seen as a nice girl to manipulate their way into your life.

Be careful.", "NTA\n\nRed flags aside, you have the right not to date someone if you don't want to.  It does not matter what reason it is (they have feelings for you, you owe them favors, other people want to see you date, etc)  No one should date someone against their will.  You are free to stay single.  If the suitor has their feelings hurt, that is not your responsibility.  They need to move on, especially your decision and deal with their emotions in a healthy manner.  You also have the right to protect yourself from people who make you feel threatened.  You do not have to \"stay friends\" if you are not comfortable with it.\n\nAnd note this applies to women AND men.", "NTA. He's not a friend, he's a future stalker.
