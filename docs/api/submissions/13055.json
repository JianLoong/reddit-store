When he doesn\u2019t bear his parental responsibilities, he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy his parental rights.", "NTA. If he doesn't want to post watermarked pictures, he can take and post his own. He's using your photos to make himself look like an active and involved dad. You are under no obligation to facilitate that charade.", "NTA - petty and maybe a step too far? But cant you just stop sending him pictures? He can take pictures on his own phone - if hes not present in your son\u2019s life then too bad.", "NTA. It's a bit petty but it doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA\n\nTheyre your photos of your child. Write whatever you want on them. Its it childish? Yeah sorta but so is your ex.\n\nLet him know that if he needs to seen his child every day he us welcome too but you have no responsibility to take photos for him.\n\nYoure not his wife or his photographer. Your divorced and a grown woman with your own life and he can no longer tell you what to do so quit doing what he tells you. This man left you with a baby and he still thinks he runs your life.", "NTA, both are parents, and it's ok to ask if the kid is doing well. But you have a total right to put a watermark on all the photos you take. That's what most of the photographers do to keep your photos so others wouldn't use them for their own personal gain, which in this case he uses them in insta, which may gain  him more followers. He should use his own content for it, not take others.", "NTA\n\nAnd I would actually petition the court to forbid him from posting the kid\u2019s picture for privacy and security.", "NTA\n\nPut the date on it too, or have a timestamp. He only wanted it to prove his son is ok, yeah? So, you complied, no problem :D\n\nAlso, as you take pictures, post them yourself, with a time stamp and watermark. When he makes demands, you can refer him to your page :D", "NTA\n\nMaybe your ex should just, oh I don\u2019t know, not be a deadbeat dad?", "NTA", "It's petty and you should have talked with your ex about his behaviour to try to solve the issue first, but you are NTA for watermarking the pictures if he is using them to pretend he is an involved dad.\n\nBut please learn to communicate and solve conflicts directly instead of using petty tactics to get a reaction, that's passive-aggressive and won't do anyone any good, especially your son.", "ESH. Him obviously for being a shitty father who doesn't involve himself in caring for his child.  You for responding to the situation like a child yourself.  It's petty and juvenile.  Just tell your ex if he wants pictures he can spend time actually parenting.  Plenty of chances for him to take pictures while he spends time with his child.", "YTA. While it's understandable that you may be upset with your ex-husband for not being present in your son's life, putting a watermark on the pictures may come across as petty and controlling. It's also worth noting that your ex-husband has a right to post pictures of his son on his social media accounts, and you should have a conversation with him about your concerns and come to an agreement that works for both of you. Adding a watermark without his consent may only escalate the situation and create more tension between the two of you.", "ESH. He is a shitty father, claiming that he doesn't have time for his son yet makes girlfriend But also claims his right to post pictures of your son.\n\nWatermarking your son's photos with your name however, sounds childish and pointless.  \n\n\nIf you're bothered by him asking photos all the time and post them on his ig, just to feel like a good father; you can tell him how you feel in a mature way. You can tell him that he can be more involved and take his own pictures.", "It is understandable that you want to protect your son's pictures and   \nmake sure they are not used inappropriately. However, putting a   \nwatermark with your name on every picture you send to your ex-husband   \ncould be seen as passive-aggressive behavior and may create more   \nconflict between you two. It is important to communicate with your   \nex-husband about your concerns and find a solution that works for both   \nof you. Perhaps you could come to an agreement on how the pictures will   \nbe shared or set some boundaries on how they will be used. It is also   \nimportant to consider how this could affect your son and his   \nrelationship with his father in the long run. Overall, it is important   \nto prioritize the well-being of your child and find a solution that   \nworks for everyone involved.", "YTA. Although your ex husband might not be in your sons life he does care. \" i need to sent him a pic of our son for him to see if he is ok\". the watermark will make thisngs more comlicated or worse", "Both assholes...poor kid!!", "YTA.... You are not with your childs father what do you care  what he does personally.  Don't be that bitter angry person that uses your child as a tool because your pissed and want to get back at him.  Stop focusing on what he's doing and not doing. Be thankful he's even asking about your child because he could easily just walk away with no concerns or contact. At some point if he's as bad as you say, your child will grow up and see him for who he truly is. In the meantime don't waste your energy. Be cordial with him for your child and whatever you do, don't talk shit about the dad no matter what you think about him. You sound more concerned about the dad then doing the right thing for your child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He doesn't actually have the right to lie about that.  So she's making sure it's clear who took the pictures.  \n\nI think her solution works fine.  Let him get mad.  He's the one who's neglecting his own son.", "Sounds like he doesn\u2019t care because he\u2019s not involved, he just wants photos to post so people think he\u2019s involved. The only reason the watermark would piss him off is because he wants the photo so he act can post and seem like he spends time with the son.", "So OP is an AH because her child\u2019s father is a shit dad?", "There's a good amount of deadbeats who do this. They only post pics to make themselves look good to family and friends on social media. This is not new lol.", "This is a really good option.", "Or send him really terrible photos (i.e. blurry) or be in the photo w/ your son and don't watermark. Better than watermarking it cause he can probably easily crop it out if it's on the bottom.", "She needs to stop being petty about watermarking a photo and focus her energy on supporting her child. Stop worrying about being angry because he's dating someone else. Who cares. The child will eventually grow up and see the dad for who he truly is if he's as bad as she says .  If she's unhappy with the father's contact or isn't getting what she needs for the child (not about her it's about the child) go to family court and plead her case. How petty to waste her time on watermarking a photo.", "That's totally fair, but this forum is legit becoming a reskin of crap - and this one was near word for word. Minus the relationship drama if I remember correctly.", "Okay fine. \n\nBut how is this not an ESH? This dude being an absent father and trying to pretend hes not on social media doesnt make him an AH?", "If he's paying his due diligence of child support, good for him. If he's not taking the time out to spend time with the child shame on him, it'll eventually come back and bite him in the ass. She's scorned because of cheating, ok I get. But to be that petty with water marking a photo? Find something better to do. She needs to go on in her life focus her energy on her child and eventually go out and find a good partner who will be good for her and great for her child. She's making it all about her feelings."]}
