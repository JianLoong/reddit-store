I told her yeah I remember him when we worked there. She was like \u201coh, Jessica (34F) (her best friend who is totally in love with Bob after 5 days of talking)  says Bob still works there and was telling her that he has manager Odie wrapped around his finger because he gets Odie drugs.\u201d\n\nWell this came as a shock to me because Odie is my best friend and as far as I know, doesn\u2019t do drugs. Odie also hasn\u2019t worked there for the past year. Odie also fired Bob 3 or 4 years ago for overdosing on the job and refusing to seek help previously.\n\nSo I called Odie and asked him, in case events happened that I wasn\u2019t privy to, and said \u201chey, did Bob end up getting rehired,\u201d to which Odie responded \u201cfuck no. He has a non removable non rehire status unless he got corporate to remove it\u201d \n\nSo Odie gets on the phone with a current employee and asks if Bob works there and the employee said \u201cno that would be a slap in the face if he came back.\u201d\n\nI also text managers from two nearby XYZ corporations just in case he doesn\u2019t work at the original one, they both laughed at me.\n\nSo I tell my wife that I\u2019m pretty sure that he doesn\u2019t work there.\n\nNow we don\u2019t care where he works and I like Bob generally, we got along when he worked for me. But Jessica is my wife\u2019s best friend so they were talking about how I talked to Odie about Bob and what transpired.\n\nWell Jessica confronts Bob about it and Bob loses his shit and starts ignoring Jessica\u2019s calls. Jessica calls my wife and tells her that Bob says I\u2019m trying to ruin his life and is adamant that he works there. Jessica believes him and is sort of upset that we didn\u2019t confront him in person and gave her information that she felt she had to immediately act on. \n\nAt this point IDFC. But I stand by my research and am pretty confident I\u2019m right. I like Bob but I haven\u2019t talked to him in 3 or 4 years and brought Odie\u2019s name up in a slanderous way and Jessica is my wife\u2019s best friend.

I\u2019m certain deep down she knows he\u2019s full of crap but is in denial. Poor thing. If I were your wife I\u2019d be having a serious talk with her about this before she gets in too deep", "Hmm...did you also write this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheDevil/comments/17oh9rp/aita_for_trying_this/) as well? Odie is not a common name, and this is the second post in the last 12 hours to have the protagonist of the same name. Both from accounts less than 24 hours old.", "I\u2019ve heard from one of the other XYZ managers that he works at a blue general goods store and Bob would text him to call out because his new manager shares the same name. I get why he wouldn\u2019t claim working there because it doesn\u2019t sound as good as working at XYZ. But unfortunately he\u2019s unlucky that I know a lot of people at XYZ.", "I agree, NTA. Bob stupidly (probably unknowingly) threw the name of your best friend into his story. You went digging a little more than I probably would have, but you didn't go any further than asking if Bob really works where you knew he was fired from. Neither you nor your wife did anything wrong. \n\nIf Jessica is unhappy with how she handled confronting Bob, that's on her. There was no reason for you to personally contact Bob, much less confront him in person. You know something of the guy Jessica is interested in. You (and your wife) shared that with Jessica. There was no need for her to act immediately; that's all in her head. Her rash decision and subsequent regret is all on her, as is her decision to believe an untrustworthy source.", "I like my memory of Bob and feel no ill will against him before now.", "A lot of habitual liars are very good at keeping up a front when they're with passing strangers like coworkers. It's not until you get to know them thoroughly that you can start to unravel their lies. Most people are generally also not so nosy as to deeply question what a coworker tells them their home life is like.", "She should just believe her best friend and her husband who works at the company telling her that he\u2019s lying and open her eyes to the huge red flags he\u2019s waiving. Clearly this guy is good at what he does if she\u2019s already in so deep. Hopefully she can snap back out of it before it\u2019s too late", "Bob is the supposed antagonist here.", "No, complete happenstance. Maybe read that and subconsciously stole the fake name, though I don\u2019t believe I read that one. Big fan of Garfield though.", "Your wife should tell her BFF to have Bob show her his latest paystub from XYZ, with his current address on it (so he can't fake it with the other Bob's paystub). He can't show her what he doesn't have.", "> he works at a blue general goods store\n\nThe Mart of Walls, I suppose? Have Jessica show up there while he's working.\n\nNTA.", "Meh\u2026once you are at that level of \u201cprove it\u201d there is no trust and that\u2019s not a good way to start a relationship. She should just dump the dude and move on.", "NTA. Jessica is truly not acting intelligently if she will believe this guy over multiple sources.", "NTA but ask your wife to tell Jessica that she doesn't want to talk about her new boyfriend, nor does she want to run into him at social occasions. Bob is lying and Jessica is choosing to believe him, even though she has been warned. This could get really messy, really fast. Your wife needs to be walking on eggshells around Jessica or pulling back from the friendship for a while.", "wait till the pink glitter glasses fall of. NTA", "I mean, other than the recent thing with BFF, I think his point is that he has no reason to slander Bob. I've had coworkers who I've felt were let go for no good reason, but no loss because I didn't vibe with them. And I've had coworkers let go with cause, and sometimes I'm sad to see them go because we got along (and occasionally they helped certain parts of my processes that made my job easier.) I obviously wouldn't make up stuff about either, lol, but sometimes the person you vibe with best at work isn't the best worker", "It\u2019s also possible that bob just started ghosting her and is using this as an excuse. She does seem a little overwhelming even from this post. I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to lie again and cut her off", "I seriously doubt that Jessica actually believes him over her friends. She\u2019s just not ready to admit she\u2019s been taken for a ride. She\u2019s hoping there\u2019s a secret third option where no one is lying to her and this was all just a big misunderstanding they\u2019ll laugh about later.", "Well that too clearly.\n\nHowever she seems a little needy, so isn\u2019t going to believe anything she doesn\u2019t see for herself.\n\nGoing there will give him less chance to talk his way out of it and will corroborate what her friend said.", "Yeah. People often won't admit they're wrong in the moment even when things are made very clear. Just give her time to process it and hope she makes the right decision later.", "Ops wife needs to sit her down and seriously talk some sense into her. I would be horrified if my friend was in her situation with a guy like this who\u2019s so comfortable lying", "Again, I don\u2019t disagree. However, I have seen needy people take the word of the person that others can clearly see are lying over that of those who have been their friend for decades, simply due to their fear of being alone.", "Oh absolutely I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. Also she confronted him, he \u201clost his shit\u201d and twisted the story, and now he\u2019s ignoring her. So she\u2019s hooked on him now and they\u2019re probably gonna have a super toxic cycle. I feel bad for her"]}
