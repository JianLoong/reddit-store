{"id": 2045, "submission_id": "ysdqxj", "title": "AITA for telling my grandmother that she's being weird and controlling towards my mother?", "selftext": "I (22M) live with my mother (41F). She's a single mother because my father passed away when I was two months old. My parents had a very short relationship (under two years) but it was very intense and they loved eachother immensely. They eloped around 7 months into their relationship and my mother still wears their wedding photo in a locket around her neck. When my father passed, my mother was extremely traumatized and she has never dated anyone since. When I asked her why she never moved on, she always said that she  wanted my father to be her first and last partner. \n\nI grew up extremely close to my paternal family. My mother has a strained relationship with her family, so after she was widowed, she moved in with my paternal grandparents and they helped her raise me until we moved out when I was ten. We remained in the same town though and saw eachother almost daily. When I was younger, my paternal grandparents encouraged my mom to date and meet new people so I'd have siblings to grow up with but she didn't want to do that. They accepted it, and then began to praise her for staying single because that shows how much she loved my father. Essentially, my entire paternal family thinks that she's amazing for staying single which I think is weird. Obviously, it's her choice to stay single but for them it's some sort of weird jealousy where they believe she belongs to the family. She also cared for my grandfather when he had cancer. \n\n\nRecently, a few deaths have occured in my mother's family and she sort of had an epiphany where she realized that she didn't want to die alone. Obviously, I wouldn't let that happen but she decided that she wanted to start dating and meeting people. I helped her set up some profiles and she started dating Henry (44M). He's a very nice man and he has two daughters in their early twenties and late teens who are also very nice too. \n\nWhen my grandparents found out that my mother had started dating, they were not very happy. They were being passive aggressive about it at first, but yesterday at a family gathering, my grandmother started calling my mother selfish. She accused my mother of lying when she said that she wanted my father to be her first and last partner and my mother ended up in tears. I immediately got involved and told my grandmother to leave my mom alone. She told me that I shouldn't be happy about my mother dating, and I said that she was being weird and controlling towards my mother and she needed to stop. I also said that my mother was a traumatized teenager when my father passed so it's unreasonable to hold her to things she said back then.\nWe left straight away, and my aunt called me to say that I was being an asshole and out of line for insulting my grandma. According to her, the family is being reminded of my father's death now that his widow (my mother) is moving on and it's a difficult time. I'm not being callous but I think they're overreacting, it's been 22 years. My aunt is demanding that I apologize.

Everything you told your grandmother was 100% accurate.", "NTA Grief is a powerful thing even decades later and I imagine that is the cause of your grandmother's unreasonable behavior. I feel for her, but that doesn't change the fact that she is being unreasonable. \n\nGood for you standing up for your mom. I'm sure her own feelings continue to be difficult and complicated. The last thing she needs is someone guilt tripping her. Your grandmother needs to work out her grief with someone else.", "NTA.  You are precious. Keep doing what you are doing, and eventually your father's family will see the light.", "Nta. They HAVE become weirdly possessive of your mother. She is a whole person and she\u2019s allowed to change her mind about what she wants the rest of her life to look like. I get that it may be hard to accept that their son/nephew won\u2019t be her last love, but it\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t still honor your father.", "NTA.  It's 22 years since their son died as you said.   If they really cared about your mom they would want her to be happy and if that means she gets someone else in her life then they should be fine with that. \n\nThey are not treating your mom as a person but as a leftover of their son.", "I mean, she was single and mourned him for 22  years, isn't that enough? NTA, they need to back off.", "NTA. Your mum sounds amazing and she deserves to be happy. She devoted herself to her in laws and they looked after her but they do not own her. They ARE acting weird & need to back off. I think I you\u2019re being a fabulous son by having her back xx", "NTA.  Grandmother and aunt are assholes.   Do whatever it takes to keep them off your mother's back.   For all that she has done for the family, they should be grateful and encourage her to do whatever she wants to be happy.   If necessary, isolate them from your mother.", "NTA...She needed to be told.  Your mother raised you well. I hope your mother finds peace and happiness.", "Back then they encouraged her to start dating again Too early but she didn't want to. Now that she actually wants to, they're shaming her for it. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour father's family is being unreasonable.   Give them some time.", "NTA. Does she, like, hate your mom?", "NTA. It\u2019s okay for your paternal family to have emotions stirred up with your mom dating, but it\u2019s not okay for them to be rude/manipulative/etc. towards your mom. It\u2019s fair of you to tell them how their actions are coming across.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good son. Keep defending your mom. Your aunt and grandma are the AHs here.", "They've put your mom on some weird kind of pedestal and now they're upset with her for living her life like a normal adult? No way. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt took your mom many years to get over her grief (but that's okay, everyone has their own times and there are also people who, after being widowed, never remarry). If now she feels that the time has come to look forward, good for her!\n\nInstead it seems your grandparents haven't gotten over their child's death yet, which is very sad, but that doesn't give them the right to control your mom's life.", "NTA but they are! Good on your mom for trying to find happiness again. Don't live for the dead.", "NTA\n\nDon't apologize. Your mom waited 22 years to be ready. If she is ready, they can surely fake it and support her. Maybe it does bring up the trama of losing him but your mom has lived that every day and still chose to move forward, after 22 years. My ex-FIL moved on 1 week after my MIL died. It was disgusting, imo.", "NTA.\n\nThey're using your mom to try to hold onto your father in a way that is not healthy.", "NTA\n\nOne of the things that often happens to people as they age, is any change from what is the world order - from their viewpoint - becomes threatening.  People as they age often become less resilient and fearful when required to adapt.\n\nWhen you and your mom were younger, your extended family was more able to deal with the idea of your mom moving on.  Now, it's rocked their expectation of the future.  It puts them in a position where they may no longer be the center of attention.  It's a cause for fear, whether they recognize it or not.  Maybe they are the ones at risk of dying alone because you and your mom will move on to a \"better\" family.\n\nAnyway, that's my guess what's happening.", "NTA. Your paternal grandparents did a great job assisting your mother to raise a great child into a  wonderful adult. Keep standing up for your mother. Her family is bats#it crazy.", "NTA\n\nThey are most likely responding out of fear that a new man in her life could push them out of the picture.  They treasure the close relationship theyve had with your mom and dont want to lose it.\n\nThat said, they are not acting reasonably or fairly.  If they keep acting like this, they may find their fears coming to fruition, based on their own bad behavior.   \n\nHopefully, they will come around and realize that they should be wishing her happiness and accept a new person in her life if they want to stay in the picture.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She deserves a life with Henry or someone else of her choosing.  You did great standing up for your mom. Tell the family if they continue to insult your mom your relationship with them may be damaged beyond repair. Ask your grandmother if that is truly what she wants. Your mom needs to put some space between her and your paternal family. You have to decide how much contact you want with them if their behavior doesn' t change.", "NTA.\n\nIt's none of their business, just keep being supportive to your mom.  I personally think it's what your dad would have wanted, even though I know nothing about him.  She stayed alone for all these years and now is ready to move on with her life from her time with your dad.  While your grandmother doesn't have to like it, she shouldn't try to interfere.", "Super interesting that they initially tried to push her to date when she wasn't ready. Accepted that, but now that she's ready it's a problem? They got too damn comfortable having her around and now feel entitled to her.  \n\nThey're probably extremely threatened by what a new man will mean for their interactions/quality time with her. \n\nNTA but maybe you can just reassure them that they'll always be a part of both of your lives, but your mom deserves to be happy again.", "I don't think so? \ud83d\ude2c They were like mother and daughter before this"]}
