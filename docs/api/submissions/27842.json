Also seems like many people don\u2019t know how to close doors while turning the handle which often wakes us up when doors are slammed in the middle of the night. \n\nOur landlord has rules and signs in place reminding guests of quiet hours however last night was the worst. \n\nThe guests arrived late, talked, packed, walked back and forth on creaking floors. At 12:30 I knocked on the door and asked them to be quiet reminding them of the time. They said \u201cok ok\u201d but only quieted their voices. \n\nThankfully they seemed to sleep at 1:30 but every hour or so they\u2019d get up to go to the bathroom which included the stomping over creaking floors and the aforementioned poor door closing habit. \n\nThen, at 3:50, the first alarm goes off, and again every hour until they finally get up at 6 and start gathering their bags by opening the hallway door and dragging their luggage into the hallway one by one. Thanks to the slightly cavernous nature of the hallway their activity inside and outside the unit is amplified. \n\nAt this point I had enough and went to their open door angrily telling them to hurry up and get out.\n\nNow I feel bad because I get along well with my landlord and I\u2019m sure these guests will leave a bad review. I also plan on being more confrontational with noisy guests in the future which will probably add more bad reviews  but I feel like the landlord is profiting off my sleep deprivation and I just want to have a liveable home. \n\nAm i wrong? Am I expecting too much? I feel like long term tenant neighbours would have a better, more normal, sleep and noise schedule than tourists. It\u2019s stressful hearing a guest arrive and not knowing whether I\u2019ll have a good or bad night sleep.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m surprised at how many \u201cjust move lol\u201d posts there are during a time when affordable housing is unattainable for many.

This is exactly one of the many reasons way Short Term rentals need to be regulated.", ">Now I feel bad because I get along well with my landlord and I\u2019m sure these guests will leave a bad review.\n\nThat's karma for the landlord. You say you have a good relationship with him but he is not respecting your right to have a peaceful and livable home environment (which you're paying him for) so he can cash in. That doesn't sound like a good relationship to me.\n\nI don't know where you live, but in my city there are rules against this. Find out if there's any official action you can take.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWow you sure managed to attract some shitty commenters with this one.", "As someone pointed out, look up local ordinances on short term rentals. Most places do not allow it within residential buildings.\n\nDon't talk to your landlord, just make an anonymous report\n\nNTA. You have the right to sleep in a longterm rental. Their vacation does not supercede that\n\nIf your building does have quiet hours visibly posted, they are definitely in the wrong as well. Short term does not negate posted signs or building rules. Even if the listing doesn't have it, if it's on a sign in the building, they have an obligation to respect that", "NTA\n\n\nThese people had signs to warn them and it's assumed they are also aware it's a residential building.\n\n\nTenants where I live are protected from things that interfere with reasonable enjoyment of your unit. Look into what your tenant rights are, and bring it up to the landlord.", "NTA - and I would check the local laws/rules regarding short term rentals and Innkeeper laws.  He might be doing something that isn't allowed in your area.", "NTA But I hope that other cities do what New York just did - essentially ban Airbnb.", "You are legally entitled to the \"quiet Enjoyment\" of your property and you absolutely should complain about the noise Air B&B is a cancer", "My landlord used to do this shit too.\n\nNOT THE ASSHOLE AT ALL \n\nMFs used to knock on MY door when they were too stupid to get in the apartment. Leave their fucking suitcases and Starbucks cups on my porch. Airbnb guests directly contribute to the housing shortage. Fuck Them. \n\nNTA", "Totally NTA. As a frequent Airbnb guest, I am always conscious of shared walls when we stay in multi-family spaces. They were simply inconsiderate guests.   \n\n\nIt sounds like you are on the ground floor. Have you thought about asking your landlord to allow you to move to the upper unit? Assuming you are physically able, it might be a win-win situation. You get the quieter unit, and he gets to keep his Airbnb.", "YTA your anger is misdirected. The issue here is landlords and builders not maintaining buildings with any level of acoustic buffering between units. If it's down to having to close the door in a special way, there's something wrong with the building", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this! You are entitled to a good nights sleep and tourists have a habit of not caring about locals in general. \nI would complain to your landlord and continue giving rude guests a piece of your mind.", "YTA. You're wrong at the wrong person. You can maybe be mad at the landlord for renting it as an AirBnB. But don't get angry at the guests and give them a hard time. They didn't do anything wrong. What you did was morally worse than what they did: The guests unintentionally disturbed you, whereas you went out of your way to disturb them, actively and intentionally.\n\nIf you interpret everyday sounds like creaky floorboards or flushing toilets as targeted personal attacks  then that speaks to your paranoia and possible mental health problems.", "YTA. The guests can't do anything about creaky floors. They are allowed to walk around without your permission. Then all they were doing was taking their luggage to the hallway and you have another fit and tell them to leave when they seemed to be in the process of leaving. You were incredibly rude.", "YTA - and so is your landlord. This house just isn\u2019t designed in a way that contains any noise. It doesn\u2019t sound like they were doing anything wrong and should be able to talk in an apartment and go the bathroom without you banging on the door. Are your in Switzerland or something? You realize you\u2019re probably just as loud to other people in that unit.", "YTA, it doesn't sound they were doing anything out of the ordinary, not their fault the walls are thin and the floors creaky.\n\nYou've been so rude to address them, especially the \"hurry up and get out\" part.\n\nI can promise you can fare almost just as poorly with a regular tenant. What if they have insomnia? Work night shift? Make love? Have a baby?\n\nConsider moving somewhere with better sound insulation?\n\nEdit: now your landlord is an AH too, for making it an AirBNB despite must having had a clear idea what a nuisance it is for the neighbours.", "YTA. It sounds like this is a building issue not renter issue (thin walls, creaky floors, and poorly hung doors). I lived in an apartment that was like this once. Does it suck? Yes. Would I be annoyed as all get out by it? Also yes. Is it the renters fault? Not even a little.", "YTA.\n\nThis is a landlord-tenant problem, not a Airbnb-guest problem. \n\nThe guests were just behaving as people do when they arrive late to a destination. They lowered their voices when you asked, but the squeaky floor and doors are not their problem. \n\nAnd, honestly, you're getting frustrated with people getting up to pee in the night? That's a bit much.\n\nMove out.", "YTA, complaining about bathroom use? Yikes", "YTA. Do you expect them to have a bedtime and not move during the night? Poor building maintenance isn't the airbnb guest's problem.", "YTA\n\nIt doesnt sound like this environment is well suited for you.  It is completely unreasonable for you to complain about people walking around and going to the bathroom after quiet hours.  I have health problems and sometimes i have to get 7-10 times during the night.  And luggage is heavy so they may have to drag it.  They cant help if floors creak, nor do they have responsibility for the creaking floors and complaining about how people turn door handles is too much. Your expectation of 100% quiet is unrealistic.\n\nYou are clearly very frustrated with the airbnb situation but the same issues could arise even with a regular tenant.  Maybe a.long term tenant could be a nurse who doesnt get off work until midnight and they stay up cooking .washing clothes etc because they have a different schedule than dayshift.\n\nYour plan to be MORE confrontational is a very bad one because you are punishing future airbnb renters because of things they didnt do.  Plus they have paid to stay there and most people will not take kindly to confrontational neighbors confronting them for simply walking and going to the bathroom.  You are placing yourself at risk by confronting strangers.  \n\nYou sound like you are very sensitive to sounds and are a light sleeper.  If that is the case, you really should consider removing yourself from the situation by finding somewhere else to live, because at the end of the day,.you can only control your own actions, you cannot control others and force them.to tiptoe around, or not move luggage loudly or limit the nbr of times they go to the bathroom or control how they turn doorknobs \n\nHave you spoke to your landlord to let them know how much you are being disturbed?  Maybe he could add sound proofing or padded rugs to help with the sound.", "YTA \n\nthe talking i understand but when you live in an apartment under another unit, you\u2019re likely to hear the ppl walk, and close doors IF the construction is poor\n\nyelling at them to hurry up and leave was outta pocket", "YTA. What if a long-term tenant moved in and used the bathroom at night? It happens.", "YTA and we\u2019re very rude to those people. Quiet hours are in regards to unreasonable noises like parties, loud music, vacuuming or home repair. Walking around, talking to each other and using the bathroom all sound reasonable. It sounds like you live in a building where the walls are thin and neighbors each hear everything going on. You need to consider looking into a sound machine or ear plugs for the future. Also long term tenants doesn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll have the same schedule as you or they could be super inconsiderate people who have loud parties all the time. Ultimately it sounds like you\u2019re over living next door to an Airbnb which is understandable but not ok to behave they way you did", "YTA they were walking around not blasting music. Don\u2019t blame them for the intact condition of the building.", "YTA. These people were just living their lives. If you could hear them just walking to the bathroom, there\u2019s a problem with the building, not a problem with the occupants. Your complaints should be made to your land lord, not his guests.", "YTA... they were making totally normal sounds. talking, walking, moving, etc. none of this is egregious.", "YTA.  Apartment living has many drawbacks, and your post described a number of them.  Only an AH would have the gall to complain about a person using the bathroom, regardless of the time.", "YTA. Quiet hours mean no parties, loud music, yelling, etc. They don't mean you can't shut a door or use the bathroom when you need to. How you navigate life being this selfish and entitled, while also miserable and offensive, is quite impressive.", "YTA - they couldn't help the floor creaks and the walls are so thin you could hear their alarms going off.  They probably wouldn't have even booked the place if they had known there'd be a neighbour that would come and yell at them for just moving about.\n\nYou should be mad at the landlord, and request that they do something to soundproof the dwelling if they are going to continue to rent it out as an AirBnB and have people coming and going frequently, as it infringes on your right to quiet enjoyment of the home you rent.\n\nBut getting more confrontational when these guests aren't partying or being intentionally loud is not going to make you any friends, nor is it going to get you a resolution.  You're going to stay mad, they're going to leave bad reviews, the landlord will get mad that you keep yelling at their guests... nobody is going to win by you continuously confronting the guests.", "To be honest, it sounds like you need to move. I don't think you're expecting too much, but I do not think this will ever change. AirBnBs are used for vacations and people are loud on vacations. You will spend all of your time being pissed that ppl are loud and having to complain.", "YTA your issue is with your landlord, not with the people who booked the unit\n\nPacking,walking, talking, and setting an alarm are perfectly normal and reasonable things to do in a unit, the issue is that the sound carries \n\nMany municipalities now regulate Airbnbs, so you should check what the rules are in yours and then report your landlord if needed", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't rent beside an AirBnB,arriving late, leaving early - that comes with the territory.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It always astounds me that some towns have laws that require landlords to provide their tenants newer renovations and appliances. Tenants are sometimes allotted money to either move or stay in a nice hotel until the landlord maintenances their units/house.
