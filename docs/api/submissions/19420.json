There are times, when one is physically capable, that the polite thing is to give a seat to someone who needs. A crowded bus, or subway, for example. It\u2019s not necessary, but, it is kind.

The husband should have held their spot in line and then called her/she came back 10min before you go in, or she should have brought her own chair if she knew she would have trouble standing for 40 min.

She can ask the staff for a chair or sit down somewhere else.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t plan ahead, her loss", "NTA. You brought your chair from home.

It would have been a kind gesture to offer her the chair and find another spot to sit or stand. \n\nIn terms of whether you're the AH, it's hard to say.

So rude of her, and the husband", "NTA. She should've brought her own chair. And you said you have your own health issues as well. I was going to say YTA based on the title lol glad I read the whole thing. And her asking repeatedly was rude.", "NTA because it was your personal chair that you brought not public seating. She doesn\u2019t get to demand someone else\u2019s chair just because she did not plan ahead. It is not like she suddenly became several months pregnant at the graduation.

I came in here thinking 100% you\u2019d be the asshole for denying a spot on a public transit (or something similar) to a pregnant woman. Then I read what happened. Who shows up to a ceremony thinking they can demand someone else\u2019s own personal chair they brought with them, just because they\u2019re pregnant and uncomfortable?

If she needed a chair that bad, why didn't the bother the staff.", "His health condition is irrelevant in this case. Even if he's perfectly healthy he doesn't have to give his belongings to someone who happened to have unprotected sex in past. It's not public seat and they aren't in pregnancy hospital.", "Right? Maybe she should have asked someone in a wheelchair to scoot over and share. \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m currently pregnant and even I feel the same way you do. Being pregnant is not an excuse to be entitled. I went to the mall to shop for a birthday present and after 20 minutes I needed to sit down. So I rested in a public seat for a bit and I told my husband that from now on we need to bring a chair and keep it in the car for emergencies! I would never even have the audacity to ask someone for their own personal belongings in order to cater to my poor planning skills.", "Why? Is sitting on the ground some kind of an embarrassment? I sit on the ground if I am tired and there is no chair or bench to sit on, or sometimes just for fun.  \nOP just gave her an idea since the lady wanted to sit.", "Or the pregnant lady is the asshole for not bringing her own chair and then being entitled enough to expect someone to give up their own chair.", "Right! I\u2019m embarrassed for her. I just had my third baby in December, I\u2019ve had very rough pregnancies, and I can\u2019t imagine asking a stranger for something like that once let alone multiple times.", "Cause it's not the community chair. She and her partner should have anticipated this and planned accordingly.", "Because the chair OP brought is not a shared resource and they should not have to do without just because some random woman couldn\u2019t think ahead.", "OP having the chair there was actually plan B; Plan A was demanding another person waiting in line get on their hands and knees for the pregnant woman to sit on their back.", "Impressed at OP for the restraint if the husband really called him an asshole to his face. I would have been mouthing off.", "I disagree, if someone near you has a health issue and needs to sit a moment you are definitely the asshole if you don\u2019t help, even if you have no legal obligation.

OP said the husband was the one that called them an asshole though so that's why I mentioned him being one. They both suck.", "It\u2019s OPs chair. They bought it, they had the foresight to bring it. It\u2019s not their problem to cater to other people lol.", "Pregnancy isn't a disease. She could go to her car and sit there.", "Good point. And pregnancy famously occurs all of the sudden and there\u2019s no way for the pregnant person to plan ahead for their own needs.", "Pregnancy isnt a health issue. She could bring her own damn chair or sit on the ground", "You sound very entitled", "And while that's absolutely appalling, and it's completely absurd such things are happening in a country that calls itself civilised, it's not really the point. \n\nWhether you have access to safe abortions or not has no bearing on your ability bring a chair, or even a cushion, to an event where you know you'll have to stand for an extended period of time.", "So is there something that stops women from using condoms or birth control? \n\nOr is fully fledged abortion the only possible way to practice safe sex? \n\nAs a woman myself I know the answer to my own question.", "So she can just dismiss the idea and say not possible and find some other way to rest.

You sound like a selfish redditor who likes to throw the word \"entitled\" around.", "You know that access to birth control is also rapidly being reduced?", "So you and no woman you know has ever had even a pregnancy scare whilst using protection? That\u2019s unbelievable. They aren\u2019t 100% effective.", "Yes, the thing stopping them is almost always a man. Whether that is at the doctor before intercourse refusing birth control to their patient. Their abusive partner at home who controls the woman and makes man of the house decisions.

OP brought their own seat, and would be under exactly ***zero*** obligation to hand it over to somebody who's only issue is being pregnant even if OP didn't have issues themselves.\n\nPregnancy doesn't automatically mean you get whatever you want, get over yourself.", "Source? We are having no problems in the U.K., also condoms exist.", "They were specifically talking about the US.", "Of course. Which is what this entire thread is about because in no other country are the rights of women being dismantled so ..quickly and efficiently.", "The comment you directly replied to was in reference to US women having an influx of forced pregnancies. It\u2019s great you don\u2019t have those issues in the UK. But since you decided to see a US comment and wanted to argue about it based on your views in the UK, you are in the wrong here. Get over it. \n\nFor your information yes, we have a problem with access to birth control, condoms (did you know we have entire state governments attempting to ban condoms??), abortion now carries criminal charges that include death penalties? Bet you don\u2019t realize that in your little \u201cUK doesn\u2019t have that problem\u201d bubble.", "You\u2019re replying to the wrong comment lol, I know all this but yeah this is what I meant"]}
