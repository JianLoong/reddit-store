I said no, sorry I need it more (bad feet/knees) and went back to my things. She asked me again within 2 minutes and the answer was the same.

She should have brought her own chair.", "NTA You brought your own chair and relaxed in it. If the pregnant woman was so miserable standing she or her partner could have brought their own chair.

Did her partner? Her lack of planning is not your emergency.", "NTA! Their failure to plan is not your emergency. I have 3 kids and have worked a non desk job through all pregnancies. Through all the swelling, weight gain, back aches and what not, I've never ever dreamed of demanding someone else's seat. \n\nI'm absolutely baffled by women that turn into the most delicate, fragile human being the moment they become pregnant. It makes no sense.", "NTA. Not your fault that you planned better than they did.", "NTA. They should have brought a chair if she knew she was going to have trouble. Don\u2019t feel bad.

But there are always other options rather than taking something from someone else. (Train and bus seats are different)", "NTA \n\nI mean it was your chair that you bought yourself. Not a public seating space. She can't expect other people to give up their things for her. And at the end of the day, she could also bring her own chair.

Bad planners", "NTA. I've been having lower back issues for a while that make it hard to stand for long periods of time but I also coach a sport that requires standing.\n\nSo I started bringing a collapsible chair to the matches so I could sit when I needed to.\n\nIf they new they were going to be standing for a long time and thought it was an issue because she's pregnant, they should have planned ahead.\n\nI've seen them for as cheap as $10-$15.", "She is pregnant not dying.

If I really was having a problem, I\u2019d have gone back to the car and had partner save me a seat.

Yeah\u2026 you might seem rude if you don\u2019t give up your seat. But that\u2019s your own chair you brought. It\u2019s embarrassing of them to ask to use it.

I\u2019ve done it a bunch, because that was less daunting than remembering to bring a chair or asking strangers to move.", "INFO - why couldnt you take turns sitting down?", "Exactly. Proper planning", "To be fair I understand op was probably annoyed with them asking so many times, it should have been understood the first time.", "Why couldn't the pregnant woman have the foresight to bring a camping chair too? Why didn't she send her husband home to bring one? How is she entitled to someone else's belonging?", "No one said she was entitled to anything, im simply trying to get some context. She might have thought there would be somewhere to sit. She may not have realised the school wouldnt let them inside. Maybe she doesnt have a camping chair and cant afford one with a baby on the way. Is it so, so horrible to be a good person and share what you have? Even for 10 minutes? He has every right to say \"no you cant sit here\" but a good person would say \"i have problems so i can only lend it to you for a few minutes before *I* need to sit down\""]}
