My dad met someone else 2yrs later, let\u2019s call her C, and 2yrs after that they got married. When they were dating she seemed great. After she and my dad got engaged, her sweetness abruptly stopped.\n\nHer 1st son, J, was born 11mo later. He shared my room. I was 11. I took on feedings, diaper changes, etc. When I came home from school, C would hand me J and storm out of the house. When I babysat, C scheduled dates at the same time & made me cancel so I could babysit J&X (next bro) for free. I kept money in a shoebox under my bed, about $300. I mentioned this to her, and soon $40 went missing. I thought it was my big brother. C screamed that it was irresponsible to keep it under my bed and it was my fault the $$ was gone because it should have been in a bank. \n\nAt 14 I started working. With my consent, C transferred $100 a week from my bank account to \u201creimburse\u201d  what they invested for me to learn a sport: $10,000. I later learned she never told my dad she was taking the money. She did this for 3yrs - over $15,000 - and fostered resentment in my dad over the $10,000. She ran up debt and pinned the blame for financial strain on me. \n\nWhen me and my full siblings went to college, we each had about $40k in 529s from my mom. All three of us received full military scholarships. I discerned out of the military, & said I wanted to use my 40k instead. I had a full ride my first year & it was enough to cover 3yrs of tuition. I was bullied & ostracized for using the money. I covered room & board working odd jobs. I scraped $500 a month: $400 to cover a bedroom & $3/day for food. Once I called home and asked C for a 1wk loan to help cover rent. She screamed that I was an entitled communist. When I came home, all of my stuff had been boxed & put in the attic, my childhood bed sold, etc.\n\nShe told my full sibs that they would get half of the $80k in their accounts. C asked if the other $40k could roll down to J & X for their college. C spent the money on a down payment for a lake house instead.\n\nEventually I was very angry and depressed. I would have explosive episodes and call C selfish. She would dissolve into tears - full on wailing - and call everyone she knew. This went on for years, until I finally got help and the explosive episodes stopped. It also helped to get wealthy. C is now much nicer to me.\n\nC felt that I had a \u201ctarget\u201d on her for \u201cyears.\u201d She has never admitted that she stole at least $50k from us. I maintain a truce only bc I want to have a relationship with my dad. \n\nNow J is in his 20s and is pissed at me for \u201cthe way I treated mom all these years\u201d and said that I\u2019m a \u201cmalignant narcissist.\u201d C feels that she was victimized by me and J is justified in sending hate texts. I\u2019m freezing J out. C thinks I need to \u201cbe patient and work through things\u201d with J just like she \u201cdid with me.\u201d But I have a job, a family & my own mental health to manage. I\u2019m ready to just shut him out. I also do not feel bad about the things I said to C.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701622298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189xlsz/aita_for_yelling_at_my_stepmom_for_years_and/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I lashed out at my stepmom for years and my brother thinks this is a sign of malignant narcissism. This should be judged because I reacted more strongly than my siblings in this situation.

If your father objects \u2014- and he should have, right from the start of her abuse\u2014- remember (and remind him) that HE let it happen. The blame resides at least equally.", "you owe them nothing. she stole thousands from you while abusing you and lying about it. let them think what you want, but id go lc/nc with them and only talk to your dad & full siblings. NTA", "OP: I guess I feel like my dad is sort of a victim too. She\u2019s 11 years younger than him (she was 30 and he was 41 when they met) and in the early years she would threaten to leave him if he didn\u2019t \u201ctreat her right.\u201d My dad is a very loyal and devoted person - he cared for my mom for a year when her cancer began to really progress - and he was really traumatized by my mom\u2019s death. He still wears their wedding ring on his pinky finger. I don\u2019t think he could psychologically handle divorcing C after that, plus he doesn\u2019t believe in divorce. He also grew up in an abusive household, so he\u2019s probably more tolerant of those patterns than he should be. He decided that marriage and his spouse \u201ccome first\u201d - which in this case he appears to have interpreted as turning a blind eye to the way she treats us.  Now he\u2019s 68 and thinking about aging and needing someone by his side. \n\nHonestly my dad and my two full siblings are deeply trauma bonded from those 6-7 years of illness, death, and loneliness, and I don\u2019t feel like I ever could really let him go. I actually think it\u2019s that bond that C resents so much.", "Yes, why???", "This is the answer", "Please. And stop making excuses for your father. He's an abusive AH too. No way you should ever allow anyone treat your children. And the fact you keep taking the blame for your justified anger. You need to go back to therapy and learn some true boundaries. Definitely is YTA to self.", "I'm very sorry, but your dad is not a victim. Loyalty is a great trait but it's not loyalty when you stay with someone who causes harm to your children. I understand that he internalized the behaviors he grew up around, and I have no doubt he was struggling after what happened with your mom and I definitely have sympathy for him for that but come on. \n\nStaying with someone so despicable as to take advantage of and STEAL from their fucking children even once, let alone for years, is not turning a blind eye, that's enabling an abuser. \n\nI understand you wanting to move forward and not lose your dad, but I really hope you know that you're allowed to be pissed, at your shitty step-mom AND at your dad for failing you and your siblings so badly. Because he did, and there's no excuse for it. He wasn't the only one grieving, his kids were too and it was his job to take care of you guys but instead he brought in a woman, the real narcissist here btw, not you, who took away your childhood by turning you into a nanny and stealing your money.", "Your dad is NOT a victim, he volunteered for that abuse and he volunteered you for it.", "NTA- Your step mom sounds like the narcissist and you sound like they were treated as her scapegoat.\n\nI recommend checking out the raised by narcissist pages here on Reddit.\n\nThere is one thing that I've brought up when someone said their siblings didn't see it.\n\nI told them because we protected them.  I protected my siblings from it a lot without even thinking about it.", "Sounds like C is the narcissist and J is a flying monkey/golden child. Where are your dad in this?
