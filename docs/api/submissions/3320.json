As someone who had crippling anxiety (diagnosed) for most of my life early life, I have two pieces of advice. 1) get her diagnosed and medicated (I know you've tried, but my meds saved my life) and 2) stop providing her a crutch. What made me finally learn coping skills was when the people I loved backed off from me and supported from a distance instead of immediately fixing my problems when I started to have a panic attack. \n\nI know it's hard to see someone you love struggling, good luck and I hope she figures herself out soon", "NTA, as someone with clinically diagnosed anxiety: something being a coping mechanism isn't a get-out-of-jail-free card for wrongdoing. And lying to and manipulating people for money is wrong, no matter your mental health diagnosis.", "NTA\n\nAt this point, lending her money when she\u2019s always losing her job and putting up with her lies, are enabling her putting off getting help.  She needs to see a doctor, she needs to get a diagnosis and help managing her struggles.", "I know many will disagree but NTA. This self-diagnosed crap that is going on today and why people can\u2019t do this or that is junk. People with legitimate diagnosed illnesses are fine but half the posts on Reddit these days are \u201cundiagnosed\u201d or \u201cself-diagnosed\u201d.  Also lots of people have anxiety and function you have to have some extreme anxiety to not be able to function. And she has already proven to you that she lies/exaggerates with the dinner with your ex examples.\n\nFrankly it\u2019s good you let her experience the reality that the world isn\u2019t fair and it\u2019s not your job to handhold her every step of the way. At some point she knows to grow up.", "NTA \n It's an explanation but does not excuse the behavior. She is failing to address the problems she has.", "NTA. While she certainly sounds like she has anxiety, that doesn't give anyone justification for acting like this.", "Lying is a coping mechanism. It makes her feel better. Same can be said of drugs and alcohol. It's not good for her. I highly recommend family therapy and individual therapy for her.  Family therapy will ensure she doesn't miss her appointments because you can pick her up for it. Anxiety isn't an excuse to lie but it seems like there's some serious issues like lack of trust from one side at least. Let her know using \"I feel...\" statements how her constant lying is eroding trust you have in her and the fact she isn't seeing a therapist means she doesn't want to change. Eventually her lies will have even worse consequences like a permanently fractured relationship with her parents and no one to bail her out.", "I know you mean well, but what you have been doing (whatever that might be) is obviously not helping.

Your daughter is using her \"anxiety\" (put in quotes since  you've stated this is not an official diagnosis) as a crutch and excuse to avoid achieving or trying anything in life. At 24 years old she can't hold a job, can't pay her bills and constantly destroys relationships with deceptive and petty behavior -- time for her to start taking ownership of her life. That's difficult and scary and uncomfortable, but if she doesn't, this will always be her life.", "NTA but you are in a situation of your own making that can easily be fixed. Stop giving her money and tell her have the therapist bill you directly if she ever decides to go. You know she lies, so this way it doesn't impact you and you'll be available to provide support if it's ever welcome.", "It sounds like she has anxiety around confrontation, and tries to avoid it by giving everybody answers they want to hear.\n\nShe definitely needs therapy, but I don't think you are going to be the one she'll take that suggestion from.", "Hi there!

There are things out there that do help \u2014 therapy and medication are two of the big ones, but not the only ones. There are also cognitive behavioral therapy workbooks, MoodGym or eCouch, etc. \n\nYou are NTA, and only your daughter can fix your daughter.

It is NOT fine to fail to seek help for those ailments.

With proper therapy, the person can learn to cope without lying to your face, and they should!", "ABSOLUTELY NTA, and I'm sorry for saying that about your daughter, but she's TA. I have anxiety and never had lied nor doing things with the excuse of having anxiety to back me up. Sounds like she uses anxiety as a tool to make things for her benefit and not having to deal with the consequences afterwards.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, as someone with anxiety, her approach is unhealthy and unsustainable. I hate confrontation and conflict, and I used to be a really bad people pleaser. But the solution isn't to avoid and lie. You have to address why you avoid confrontation of any sort with a therapist.\n\nShe is being manipulative by insisting that her method of \"coping\" is valid and can't be questioned. I think you have to make some firm boundaries. You can say, \"I love you, and I see that you are struggling right now. But I can't keep helping you avoid confrontation and face no consequences from that. I want to support you, which I why I will help you to see a therapist, but I can't enable your current method of dealing with your anxiety.\"", "NTA I\u2019m right around her age and I used to be extremely forgetful about things, still can be, but I learned to stop running from my wrongs. She doesn\u2019t even need to magically become \u201cfixed and healed\u201d but just needs to start approaching situations differently (for example, texting something like \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to do it this Friday, how about next week?\u201d) instead of flat-out lying. It\u2019s kind of trendy these days to blame everything on anxiety, so she really needs some new inspiration. If she\u2019s on social media a lot it\u2019s probably what\u2019s reinforcing her beliefs that her anxiety is debilitating, to the point of being an excuse for absolutely everything - like I said, social media these days targeted at young women is going through a phase of making anxiety seem like its a serious mental impairment. Granted, it can be, but that\u2019s exactly what therapy is for. You\u2019re literally offering it for free to her. I just don\u2019t understand how she could pass that up while still using her anxiety as a scapegoat.", "NTA. For one thing, people these days need to STOP with all the self-diagnosing. More often than not, they end up finding out they're wrong about said self-diagnosis. \n\nAnd for another thing, anxiety, or any other mental health issue, isn't an excuse to act crappy.", "NTA. She doesn't want to go to therapy and get help. She's comfortable as she is. You're just going to have to stop helping her.", "NTA. I\u2019m not saying she does or does not have anxiety, but it still doesn\u2019t give her the right to act like this.", "NTA- you said it perfectly OP. Anxiety is not an excuse to lie to everybody about everything. Cut her off. The world doesn't put up with her shit, neither should you.", "NTA. As someone who also has self-diagnosed anxiety (along with a myriad of professionally diagnosed mental issues lol), it seems that your daughter has latched onto some extremely unhealthy coping mechanisms and would definitely benefit from consistently seeing a professional.  Sadly, your support can only do so much; someone needs to *want* to change in order to do so.", "NTA. After a traumatising event happened to me, I had severe, severe anxiety to the point I became agoraphobic. I tried to hide it from friends and family and work because I was so ashamed. I was moody, temperamental and most of my relationships broke down around me. This continued until I snapped under the pressure. Once it came out into the open, my support system rallied back round and I was properly medicated. It is horrific but your daughter may need to hit rock bottom before she is willing to accept help. That was my trigger. Don\u2019t give up on your daughter. My mother was in the same boat with me and she hadn\u2019t known something horrible had happened to me. She just thought I was screwing up. Which I was. But also don\u2019t let her internalise everything to the point where she goes too far. Support her from a distance and let her know you are there when she needs to talk. It\u2019s a good sign she hasn\u2019t cut contact with you. Keep the link.", "NTA but it's time to stop swooping in for the save.  She's an adult and she has to learn how to deal with her situation if it indeed is legit.", "NTA. She is just ruining her relationships because she os anxious about therapy. It happens, I know. Tell her you will be there when she is ready to get help, but that you will not support her anymore if all she does is lie.", "NTA - there is being supportive and there is enabling.  As a parent, I find it mortifying that she won\u2019t reply to attempts to communicate when she doesn\u2019t show up where she is expected to be.", "NTA.

Finding a good doctor is hard, the tests are expensive, etc. Eventually it's best they get professionally diagnosed and helped but self diagnosing allows them to reach out to others for support in the meantime.\n\nHowever.\nThis is NOT the case with your daughter. You are paying for a therapist and she refuses to go. You offer to pay for everything, there are no barriers for her to get diagnosed. This is on her. She can't hide behind anxiety as an excuse for being bad at communicating and purposely lying to people. I was expecting her to be a teenager but a 24 year old should know better. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink. Stop enabling her but still offer to pay if she actually goes to the appointment. Maybe tell her that if she doesn't go she has to pay for the late/no show fees. No more financial help until she pays you back. It pisses me off that she's demanding you let her continue to lie to people because it's her precious coping mechanism.\n\nI would however recommend she sees a psychiatrist.

Tie any future monetary support to her attending therapy, and physically drive her to the appointments yourself, watch her get checked in, and wait in the waiting room for her to leave to know she's actually attending the full appointment. \n\n2.)

Just as it can be your decision not to assist her financially for non-medical expenses.", "NTA - I've actually been in your daughter's position, (when it came to school and not work though) and I can 10000 per cent say that lying about it was the worst decision I ever made - fuelled by depression and negative self-worth.\n\nMy lying was fuelled by wanting my parents to have a positive view of myself/shame at how far I'd fallen. Battling my negative feelings was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.", "NTA: her coping mechanism is not healthy. I\u2019ve been there and it can lead to more problems. It sounds like her anxiety is getting worse and perhaps a touch of add as well. \n\nI really hope she gets an on paper diagnosis so she can gain access to resources.", "NTA. Her anxiety causing her to be late and other things is an explanation it\u2019s not an excuse.\nAnd especially so since you\u2019ve tried to get her some professional help. At this point its not good to keep enabling her behavior. Idk how to broach this topic, I\u2019d definitely consult the therapist to see the best way to discuss this with her. \n\nI have anxiety and other mental health issues and seeing a therapist has helped me tremendously. If the therapist you found for her isn\u2019t a good fit then find another. That\u2019s what I did until I found my current therapist.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to stop enabling her.\n\nMake therapy and a job a requirement for getting financial help from you. Tell her you want proof that she is attending both (receipt stubs from therapy, paycheck stubs from the job) to show that she is indeed working and going to therapy before you will give her any money.\n\nAnxiety is a tough battle to fight, but she's not fighting. She's letting other people take care of her. She does indeed need support, but that support needs to be in the form of a firm hand guiding her towards diagnosis and therapy.\n\n(My younger sister struggles with anxiety too and this is the same problem we had with her. Mom had to give her the same ultimatum to get her to go to therapy and go on meds.)", "NTA but it\u2019s time to allow her to be an adult. Adults find ways to cope with their issues, even severe anxiety. But she isn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t need to become you guys protect her from bad outcomes. I would give her a heads up that things are going to change. You guys will only offer help AFTER she goes to therapy (you need to get proof). Also she needs to be seen and diagnosed by an expert (get proof). Then, while she is working on herself you will help her. But until then I would back WAY off.", "NTA. I (28f) have been dealing with severe anxiety and depression since I was about 11. I would have given ANYTHING for one of my parents to offer what you are offering her. I didn\u2019t get help until three months ago, medicated and cognitive behavioural therapy and now waiting to hear back from the doctor about actual counselling. \nAnxiety can be crippling, it can seriously impact your life\u2026but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever caused me to lie to my loved ones. Honestly with the \u2018gaslighting\u2019 comment it kinda feels like she doesn\u2019t want to see that she is actually the problem here, thing is until she is ready herself to go and get help you have to let her make the mistakes she\u2019s making. I am sorry your going through this OP.", "NTA I have been diagnosed with anxiety, take medication for it (sertraline), and have spoken to a therapist about it. There healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms for this and any mental illness. Lying is not a healthy coping mechanism. It sounds like you want to support your daughter and her challenges, but in a way that brings about lasting, healthy change. Sorry, OP. As a mom, I can only imagine how frustrating this is.", "NTA - It sounds like she absolutely has anxiety but what\u2019s causing it? Is it medical (hormonal); rooted in something psychiatric? (ADD); emotionally based? (Childhood trauma, not implying from you) etc. \n\nIf she\u2019s unwilling to get help, you can\u2019t force her. \n\nBut.\n\nYOU should see a therapist, and have them help you figure out the best way to help her. I don\u2019t know that cutting her off, telling her to get therapy, etc is the best way. But a therapist will help you help her.", "Lying is not a good coping mechanism as it creates a wake of problems. Young people hate hearing this as it comes off as insensitive but anxiety is the most easily treated condition one could have with or without meds. She needs therapy but is avoiding it because she doesn\u2019t want to do the work that she needs to do and find realistic coping mechanisms. She knows the therapist is not going to condone just continually lying to people to get out of having real relationships with them wether it be work, family, friends, or whatever. I have suffered like your daughter for years and am more than ten years in therapy and am doing well. NTA", "Shes the one trying to gaslight you. NTA", "Instead of paying for a therapist. Reimburse her for the appointments she actually goes to if you want to support her. She\u2019s avoiding things that make her uncomfortable and you\u2019re trying to be helpful but she needs to feel ownership for her decisions, she needs to take financial responsibility for her choices or else she won\u2019t feel empowered to figure out her own life", "Wow... its come to the point where you cant call out liars because it's a coping mechanism?  You need to stop enabling her. If she is hungry, drop off a bag of food. No more cash!  She must show some initiative in looking after herself or she will never launch. Let her know that you dont accept her manipulative comments either. If she can't be straight up, she can manipulate someone else.\n\nNTA", "I WISH one of my kids would hang up on me! It would be the last call we have until they sincerely apologize to me. Anyway, she seems to use her anxiety as a crutch with her fam. Hold off on the therapist talk. You may have to let your daughter fall in order to shake some sense into her.", "NTA", "NTA offer help via medical assistance. Then back off. Let your kid choose to accept it or not.", "NTA. I have been diagnosed with two anxiety disorders and none of what you're describing adds up. I'm questioning whether she even has anxiety or she's just using that to excuse her immaturity and bad habits.", "Is this anxiety or avoidant personality disorder? Probably both.\n\nNTA\n\nYour daughter is legally an adult and you're trying to help and she's fighting you.", "NTA. Oh dear god, the people who call anyone calling them out on their bad behavior \"gas lighters\". You need to cut off your daughter unless she goes to therapy. She's clearly got something quite wrong with her emotionally and needs to work on it. It sounds like you and her dad have been supportive and trying to get her to help herself but she just doesn't do it. MANY people have severe anxiety and aren't compulsive liars. Your daughter is just acting as though her bad behavior being the result of an untreated mental health issue is somehow a good excuse.", "Unpopular, but YTA. Give her money, done give her money, IDK. What makes you the asshole is that you don\u2019t believe that she has anxiety. As someone who has dealt with crippling anxiety and depression on and off through-out my life, I know exactly what it feels like to commit to something and then realizing that you just can\u2019t do it. You should be understanding. Again, I\u2019m not saying you have to give her money, but at least me understanding and loving.", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like your daughter is gaslighting you. You sounds like a supportive mother, who has tried everything you can. She is an adult. Might be time for her to take ownership of her life", "Look up fawning (as in fight, flight, freeze and fawn). I don't know what to suggest to help her without knowing more details. She really needs to get the diagnosis and make sure she doesn't have some other physical issue (I ended up having Crohn's undiagnosed for years because it was just anxiety and depression).\n\nYou might need to make your help conditional on her going to therapy. If she can't support herself she may need to move home. Please try and be kind to her while also setting reasonable boundaries around how she's treating you. Her mental health is not a reason to treat you and others badly, but a little empathy will also go a long way. I'm here mind, probably, everyone is out to get her, and until she works out that's not the case, it's going to be hard for her to address it.\n\nNAH.\n\nEdit: word.", "NTA\nLying isn't a good coping mechanism. I have sever anxiety, and while I struggle still, meds and behavioral therapy have helped.", "What is leaning you toward ADHD?", "I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m glad you are in a better place now!", "Me, too. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s pretending to have anxiety to take advantage of me like some comments have implied (or at least I hope not), but if she won\u2019t at least get a diagnosis, she can\u2019t access help OR ask for any accommodation from employers.", "Thank you. I just want her to be okay.", "Well, your anxiety isn't an excuse to lie either.", "Chiming in as someone who also has terrible (diagnosed and medicated) anxiety. It's not an excuse. To be honest I feel like it's made me more successful in a way because the thought of failure triggers mine. I have employees in their teens/ early 20s try to use anxiety as an excuse and when I say I also have anxiety their face drops. My best friend also has terrible anxiety. We are both directors who oversee employees and departments. Not saying your daughter doesn't have anxiety but I find it strange she wouldn't seek help for it. I do everything in my power to avoid feeling the full effects of mine which include taking medication. It seems like some people try to use undiagnosed mental illness as an excuse instead of owning up and coping which invalidates those who truly suffer. /Rant", "I think her self diagnosis is wrong.  I think she has ADHD, and I think you should take her to a psychiatrist who specializes in women with ADHD.  Make the appointment, remind her, show up to pick her.  All her actions seem very ADHD.  Also have her join the group on FB called women with ADHD or something similar.  There are tons of members.", "Time for intervention mama", ">She just \u201cdidn\u2019t want me to start on her\u201d about therapy again.\n\nAka didn't want to face very mild consequences.\n\nI think you're spot on when you say in another comment that your future help should come with the condition that she goes to therapy. She might reject it and it'll be hard to watch her suffer the actual consequences of her choices but you can't keep sheltering her and hope she decides to be better. Best wishes.", ">The worst part is that she admits that she knows I wouldn\u2019t have let her starve even if she\u2019d told me she\u2019d been fired! She just \u201cdidn\u2019t want me to start on her\u201d about therapy again.\n\nShe is admitting to purposely lying to manipulate you. This is really serious bad behavior.", "I had the same thought. This is literally like saying \"Geez mom I can't stop doing cocaine, that's my coping mechanism!\" Yeah but it's a MAL ADAPTIVE ONE", "Chronic lateness, loosing jobs frequently, can\u2019t bring herself to make an appointment, anxiety around social backlash for her symptoms\u2026 but some of the other things you describe her doing are beyond ADHD or anxiety in my opinion. \n\nI think if she\u2019s willing to see someone, you should schedule an appointment for a psych evaluation for her.", "Haha - it's been a long process. And still ongoing - I hesitate to give advice on how to conquer depression, because everyone's battle is unique.", "I think that if she is going to the lengths of lying about having anxiety to avoid getting or keeping a job, that is a reason to go to therapy in and of itself.", "I think it depends on the situation. Lie is a strong word. Sometimes - when I was younger - I thought I could do something only to be faced with it and knowing I can\u2019t. Now, at 42, I have a much better sense of what I can\u2019t and can\u2019t handle. That came with age and therapy though.", "Can you point out what you think is symptomatic of ADHD in her described behavior? I\u2019d genuinely like to know.", "Possibly anxiety could come from the ADHD.\n\nPersonal/anecdotal example: I use to have a problem with getting ready in time when I was little, so I get worried about being late. This has caused me to mimic that meme of having alarms for like every half hour of the day. Legit my work alarm is 3 separate alarms.\n\nI outwardly have good time management, but it has become the opposite, so I overly focuse on not being late.", "Thank you.", "Thank you.", "Time blindness and rejection sensitive dysphoria. \n\nIMO, as a woman with professionally diagnosed and medicated ADHD. \n\nShe reminds me of me when I don't take my meds haha.", "The chronic lateness across all aspects of her life, is the first things that made me think of ADHD and the difficulty keeping jobs. Also the fact that she makes commitments to go places and see ppl and then just doesn't and doesn't contact anyone. \n\nTimeblindness is a symptom of ADHD, it where you have no real sense of time, and this can be under judging how long it takes you to do something or get somewhere, get distracted by doing something else that in you head takes 5 mins but really doesn't, think it Ng that you can totally get somewhere in 5mins because you did once, but not factoring it that when you did that it was 3am and there was no traffic and now it's rush hour so you'll be sat in traffic for had an hour! \n\nAlso the meeting people and then not showing up, you'll agree have every intention of going and then just forget about it untill after the fact, and then you may not want to deal with the shame that you feel for having forgot about it so you just ignore everyone on it, which only makes you more stressed and the you forget that you did this the last time and agree to do it again, but forget. And so the cycle continues. ADHD causes memory issues. \n\nIt also causes anxiety as you can be constantly stressed and worried about everything. And the you have ppl taking to you about this and calling you out which just adds to the stress and anxiety. But this for me at least was all internal.\n\nADHD also presents differently in women and girls when compared to boys - who the stereotype is based on, so women tend to be diagnosed much later in life", "I also thought this sounded like undiagnosed ADHD!", "Mental healthcare is tough to get even when you hav money. So I\u2019m by no means arguing that it\u2019s easy to get (and I know plenty of people with various mental health issues from the not extreme to extreme). But it\u2019s just become a crutch these days and you can see it by the sheer number of people who claim they can\u2019t work or thta they can\u2019t do things because of their ADHD or their anxiety etc.. Some obviously have it but it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s become an easy out also. Which is sad because it makes it hard for  people who truly have it to get help.", "Thank you.", "Thank you!"]}
