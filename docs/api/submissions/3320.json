As someone who had crippling anxiety (diagnosed) for most of my life early life, I have two pieces of advice. 1) get her diagnosed and medicated (I know you've tried, but my meds saved my life) and 2) stop providing her a crutch. What made me finally learn coping skills was when the people I loved backed off from me and supported from a distance instead of immediately fixing my problems when I started to have a panic attack. \n\nI know it's hard to see someone you love struggling, good luck and I hope she figures herself out soon", "NTA, as someone with clinically diagnosed anxiety: something being a coping mechanism isn't a get-out-of-jail-free card for wrongdoing. And lying to and manipulating people for money is wrong, no matter your mental health diagnosis.", "NTA\n\nAt this point, lending her money when she\u2019s always losing her job and putting up with her lies, are enabling her putting off getting help.  She needs to see a doctor, she needs to get a diagnosis and help managing her struggles.", "I know many will disagree but NTA. This self-diagnosed crap that is going on today and why people can\u2019t do this or that is junk. People with legitimate diagnosed illnesses are fine but half the posts on Reddit these days are \u201cundiagnosed\u201d or \u201cself-diagnosed\u201d.  Also lots of people have anxiety and function you have to have some extreme anxiety to not be able to function. And she has already proven to you that she lies/exaggerates with the dinner with your ex examples.\n\nFrankly it\u2019s good you let her experience the reality that the world isn\u2019t fair and it\u2019s not your job to handhold her every step of the way. At some point she knows to grow up.", "NTA \n It's an explanation but does not excuse the behavior. She is failing to address the problems she has.", "NTA. While she certainly sounds like she has anxiety, that doesn't give anyone justification for acting like this.", "Lying is a coping mechanism. It makes her feel better. Same can be said of drugs and alcohol. It's not good for her. I highly recommend family therapy and individual therapy for her.  Family therapy will ensure she doesn't miss her appointments because you can pick her up for it. Anxiety isn't an excuse to lie but it seems like there's some serious issues like lack of trust from one side at least. Let her know using \"I feel...\" statements how her constant lying is eroding trust you have in her and the fact she isn't seeing a therapist means she doesn't want to change. Eventually her lies will have even worse consequences like a permanently fractured relationship with her parents and no one to bail her out.", "I know you mean well, but what you have been doing (whatever that might be) is obviously not helping. You got a book recommendation on AVPD, that\u2019s a good start, because, without understanding of the problem, any solution you\u2019d offer will be lacking.", "NTA. Your daughter is letting her mental illness become her whole personality. Pathological lying is not a good coping mechanism and she definitely needs professional help.", "NTA\n\nFully agree with others that you\u2019re being gaslit and manipulated by her self-diagnosis. Seeing a therapist yourself would help you navigate and have a sounding board on the best way to help your daughter, while also protecting your boundaries.", "NTA. Time for tough love, mom. Your daughter is using her \"anxiety\" (put in quotes since  you've stated this is not an official diagnosis) as a crutch and excuse to avoid achieving or trying anything in life. At 24 years old she can't hold a job, can't pay her bills and constantly destroys relationships with deceptive and petty behavior -- time for her to start taking ownership of her life. That's difficult and scary and uncomfortable, but if she doesn't, this will always be her life.", "NTA but you are in a situation of your own making that can easily be fixed. Stop giving her money and tell her have the therapist bill you directly if she ever decides to go. You know she lies, so this way it doesn't impact you and you'll be available to provide support if it's ever welcome.", "It sounds like she has anxiety around confrontation, and tries to avoid it by giving everybody answers they want to hear.\n\nShe definitely needs therapy, but I don't think you are going to be the one she'll take that suggestion from.", "Hi there! I\u2019ve been formally diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

There are things out there that do help \u2014 therapy and medication are two of the big ones, but not the only ones. There are also cognitive behavioral therapy workbooks, MoodGym or eCouch, etc. \n\nYou are NTA, and only your daughter can fix your daughter.

It is NOT fine to fail to seek help for those ailments. If your daughter wants to drive herself into an early grave by not taking care of her mental health issues, that's her choice, but she's going to quickly find out that the world doesn't give a single shit about a self-diagnosis. \n\nShe will never get accommodations without a real diagnosis, and you should stop accommodating her.", "I have a sibling with Avoidant Personality Disorder and this is how they behave. It is a very difficult thing to navigate. It is okay to not want to enable them and to encourage them to get help.

Lots of people with anxiety manage to stay truthful people, and anxiety is certainly no excuse to deceive other people. I am sorry your daughter has developed like this, and I wouldn't give her any more money, unless she changes her ways.\n\nETA: Even if lying can be part of certain personality disorders, like certain types of Borderline for instance, it doesn't mean that the rest of the world should accept it. With proper therapy, the person can learn to cope without lying to your face, and they should!", "ABSOLUTELY NTA, and I'm sorry for saying that about your daughter, but she's TA. I have anxiety and never had lied nor doing things with the excuse of having anxiety to back me up. Sounds like she uses anxiety as a tool to make things for her benefit and not having to deal with the consequences afterwards.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, as someone with anxiety, her approach is unhealthy and unsustainable. I hate confrontation and conflict, and I used to be a really bad people pleaser. But the solution isn't to avoid and lie. You have to address why you avoid confrontation of any sort with a therapist.\n\nShe is being manipulative by insisting that her method of \"coping\" is valid and can't be questioned. I think you have to make some firm boundaries. You can say, \"I love you, and I see that you are struggling right now. But I can't keep helping you avoid confrontation and face no consequences from that. I want to support you, which I why I will help you to see a therapist, but I can't enable your current method of dealing with your anxiety.\"", "NTA I\u2019m right around her age and I used to be extremely forgetful about things, still can be, but I learned to stop running from my wrongs. She doesn\u2019t even need to magically become \u201cfixed and healed\u201d but just needs to start approaching situations differently (for example, texting something like \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to do it this Friday, how about next week?\u201d) instead of flat-out lying. It\u2019s kind of trendy these days to blame everything on anxiety, so she really needs some new inspiration. If she\u2019s on social media a lot it\u2019s probably what\u2019s reinforcing her beliefs that her anxiety is debilitating, to the point of being an excuse for absolutely everything - like I said, social media these days targeted at young women is going through a phase of making anxiety seem like its a serious mental impairment. Granted, it can be, but that\u2019s exactly what therapy is for. You\u2019re literally offering it for free to her. I just don\u2019t understand how she could pass that up while still using her anxiety as a scapegoat.", "NTA. For one thing, people these days need to STOP with all the self-diagnosing. More often than not, they end up finding out they're wrong about said self-diagnosis. \n\nAnd for another thing, anxiety, or any other mental health issue, isn't an excuse to act crappy.", "NTA. She doesn't want to go to therapy and get help. She's comfortable as she is. You're just going to have to stop helping her.", "NTA. I\u2019m not saying she does or does not have anxiety, but it still doesn\u2019t give her the right to act like this.", "NTA- you said it perfectly OP. Anxiety is not an excuse to lie to everybody about everything. Cut her off. The world doesn't put up with her shit, neither should you.", "NTA. As someone who also has self-diagnosed anxiety (along with a myriad of professionally diagnosed mental issues lol), it seems that your daughter has latched onto some extremely unhealthy coping mechanisms and would definitely benefit from consistently seeing a professional.  Sadly, your support can only do so much; someone needs to *want* to change in order to do so.", "NTA. After a traumatising event happened to me, I had severe, severe anxiety to the point I became agoraphobic. I tried to hide it from friends and family and work because I was so ashamed. I was moody, temperamental and most of my relationships broke down around me. This continued until I snapped under the pressure. Once it came out into the open, my support system rallied back round and I was properly medicated. It is horrific but your daughter may need to hit rock bottom before she is willing to accept help. That was my trigger. Don\u2019t give up on your daughter. My mother was in the same boat with me and she hadn\u2019t known something horrible had happened to me. She just thought I was screwing up. Which I was. But also don\u2019t let her internalise everything to the point where she goes too far. Support her from a distance and let her know you are there when she needs to talk. It\u2019s a good sign she hasn\u2019t cut contact with you. Keep the link.", "NTA but it's time to stop swooping in for the save.  She's an adult and she has to learn how to deal with her situation if it indeed is legit.", "NTA. She is just ruining her relationships because she os anxious about therapy. It happens, I know. Tell her you will be there when she is ready to get help, but that you will not support her anymore if all she does is lie.", "NTA - there is being supportive and there is enabling.  As a parent, I find it mortifying that she won\u2019t reply to attempts to communicate when she doesn\u2019t show up where she is expected to be.", "NTA.

Just because something makes the anxiety a little better doesn\u2019t make it a healthy behavior, and therapy is where you learn to tease out the unhealthy and develop the healthy.", "I generally disagree with this idea, people may self diagnose if they don't have the resources to get professionally diagnosed. Finding a good doctor is hard, the tests are expensive, etc. Eventually it's best they get professionally diagnosed and helped but self diagnosing allows them to reach out to others for support in the meantime.\n\nHowever.\nThis is NOT the case with your daughter. You are paying for a therapist and she refuses to go. You offer to pay for everything, there are no barriers for her to get diagnosed. This is on her. She can't hide behind anxiety as an excuse for being bad at communicating and purposely lying to people. I was expecting her to be a teenager but a 24 year old should know better. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink. Stop enabling her but still offer to pay if she actually goes to the appointment. Maybe tell her that if she doesn't go she has to pay for the late/no show fees. No more financial help until she pays you back. It pisses me off that she's demanding you let her continue to lie to people because it's her precious coping mechanism.\n\nI would however recommend she sees a psychiatrist.

Tie any future monetary support to her attending therapy, and physically drive her to the appointments yourself, watch her get checked in, and wait in the waiting room for her to leave to know she's actually attending the full appointment. \n\n2.)
