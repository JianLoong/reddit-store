{"id": 14829, "submission_id": "12mps2r", "title": "AITA for not considering my family's schedule for my wedding?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e (28F) and I (31M) have been together for over 4 years. We have always been very vocal with everyone about having a destination wedding. We love to travel, and weddings in the US are VERY expensive. We are paying for everything ourselves and receiving no financial help from family. All of our friends and family are pretty well off, especially my mom who owns a very successful business.\n\nLast year I finally popped the question to my now fianc\u00e9e. We were ecstatic and we started planning immediately.\n\nFor the destination we initially decided on my fianc\u00e9's hometown in Mexico. This is where the first issue started. My mom was questioning what there was to do around that area since they wanted to bundle the wedding with a vacation and she didn't see the location as \"ideal\". Second issue was that it wasn't fair that my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family got to have the wedding so close to their home when my family had to travel so far. So eventually we scratched Mexico as a destination spot and went with a more \"fair\" place where both sides had to travel. We ended up choosing Italy (believe it or not Italy is surprisingly affordable compared to the US). Note: We are paying for a 2 night stay in our venue for our immediate family including siblings (I have 6 my fianc\u00e9 has 2).\n\nFor the date, we chose our 5th anniversary which is October 2023. This date is sentimental to us and it was 18 months away at the time and long enough for everyone attending to plan their trip. This is where the largest issue ensued with my mom. She was extremely upset and blew up on me (putting it mildly) because the date that we chose for our wedding coincided with my brother's (16M) HS football games along with activities for my other three siblings (14M, 7F, 7F). They accused us of being selfish and inconsiderate for picking such an inconvenient date especially for my brother (16M) since he is the quarterback of his team. According to her, it was impossible for him to skip a single game or practice, leaving him out of the wedding. They have threatened to not attend our wedding unless we change the date to summer or December to accomodate my siblings. If we were to change it, it would increase the cost for us and guests significantly due to high travel season. We chose this date because it meant something to us and moving it was non-negotiable. My family still believes that we are targeting them and purposefully excluding them from the wedding.\n\nThis has been very hard for me since I am a very non confrontational person, but I am holding my ground. Everyone else is excited and very supportive. Over 40 people have already RSVP'd and started planning their trips but my parents have not even bought tickets yet. AITA for not changing my wedding date and by consequence excluding my brother?", "created_utc": 1681532630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mps2r/aita_for_not_considering_my_familys_schedule_for/", "score": 3803, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your family is going to be annoying anyway at least go with what you want 100 percent.\n\n\n\nEdit to add my other comment from down below (some people are getting heated and it explains the rest of my thinking)\n\n\n\nI honestly don't care for designation weddings myself (it  seems a little like inviting your family to your honeymoon) but it's their wedding. \n\nIf the younger siblings can't go they can't go. That's the gamble of having a wedding that far from home. \n\nI think people make entirely too much out of weddings. It's the marriage that's important. \n\nIf it were me, I would get married by a justice of the peace and spend all that money on a trip to Italy, Greece and maybe Turkey with my new spouse. Weddings cost way too much. Leave the family at home.", "[deleted]", "Thats the problem with destination wedding, in order for people to make it they need to mess with stuff in there lives. Not a quick thing on the weekend they need to plan like a week and take off work and other annoying things. The more kids people have the harder it is, money wise and planning wise\n\nNAH", "I don't really know if I can grade this one. Your parents are AH for being this controlling about the wedding, and giving you ultimatums. But this is the issues with destination weddings, especially when you have four school age siblings and it's during the school year. It's your wedding and you can plan it how you want, but destination weddings always leave somebody out. Your mom is correct that your brother really can't miss games during high school football season, so realistically he is excluded no matter what. \n\nIt just seems like a tough situation all around and this is what comes out of destination weddings. They are great if you have guests without school age kids who can afford it. But with 4 young siblings, scheduling in the middle of the school year was bound to cause problems for them.\n\nEdit: going with ESH. You are probably locked into your date now because of sunk costs, but you saying it's \"non-negotiable\" because of symbolic significance puts that ahead of your family's practical ability to get there. Again, it's your wedding and you are not obligated to schedule around anyone, but you also can't be mad then if they don't come and it strains the family relationship.", "You can do what you want in the end, but you have no right to be upset when they don't come.", "NAH. Your wedding, your choice of date and destination. But just don't be suprised or upset when 1 or more of your parents and at least your 16 bro isn't there. Besides football, junior year is college prep year. Also, your 14 bro will be in his 1st semester of HS; he may not want to miss out on anything. The two 7 sisters probably wouldn't miss anything in school.", "ESH. Unfortunately you do have school aged siblings so you should have considered that when planning. I understand that the date is special to you, but it's not really that simple to just take kids out of school for a week in the middle of a semester. That is a really long time to miss whatever they're learning in class- which can be difficult to make up at home.\n\nI'm not sure how Italy is somehow a compromise between Mexico and the US, either.\n\nYour parents are kind of being jerks by getting you to change the destination, though. It's not their wedding, they really shouldn't have so much influence over the venue, especially if they're not paying for it and the travel part isn't an issue. They're also being a bit silly about you \"targeting\" them somehow.", "NAH/YTA. You can\u2019t expect your parents to drop everything during the school year when they have school age children, to fly across the Atlantic for a destination wedding. You have to consider low attendance when you choose a destination wedding. I still don\u2019t see how a wedding in Italy is cheaper than stateside. Plane tickets alone are $$$", "ESH - it was pretty rude and unreasonable for your mom to get upset about having the wedding in your fianc\u00e9s home town in Mexico. It\u2019s very common that one side of the family to travel for a wedding. \n\nYou have 3 siblings who are in school and you planned a destination wedding right in the middle of the school year! What on earth were you thinking? Do you like your siblings? Do you even want them at your wedding? They\u2019re just kids, what did they ever do to you? I bet they look up to you and would really like to be there on your special day. it\u2019s very selfish and cruel to exclude them like that and cause all that drama for your parents.", "You chose a destination wedding during the school year when you have siblings on school. You knew what you were doing. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you want your family to attend your wedding, their schedules have to matter to you. If you don\u2019t care if your family is there, be clear on that.\n\nIt sounds like you want to elope but you\u2019re too disrespectful to just say it.", "You have four siblings in school, and made the choice to arrange a wedding half way around the planet during the middle of the school term.\n\nTwo of your siblings are in high school. There is zero chance I'd be taking my high school kids out of class for a week or more in the middle of term for a vacation. If I was your parent, I wouldn't be coming to your wedding, because I'd need to stay at home with my school-aged kids who were attending school.\n\nSounds like you just assumed that your parents and siblings would be OK with blowing off a week of school in order to fly half way around the planet to see you get married. Looks like you assumed wrong. School dates are well known, and are not subject to negotiation. Your brother can't plan to not have school that week, even if he knows 18 months in advance. That's not how schools work.\n\n(It's absurd to fly from the US to Europe for 2 nights. Have you not heard of jet lag at all? I've done business trips like this, and it's possible, but brutal. It's not something I would actually do by choice.)\n\nYTA", "I may be in the minority here YTA here.  For many of the things you said, like choosing to plan the wedding at a destination, etc. you're totally NTA; but one of the first rules of etiquette is that before you set the date you make sure that your close family can be there, if you want them there.  Other people's lives continue on, and they may have unavoidable conflicts, even if you are getting married.  It's not like the world just stops and people can just go to Italy at literally anytime just because you're getting married there.\n\nYTA for not checking if they could make it on this \\*huge\\* trip at the time when you wanted them to go.  If you don't do that, it's valid for them to feel that you didn't care enough whether or not they could make it, to even check if they could.  Which it honestly sounds like you kind of don't care -- if your parents can't go, who cares about those 40 people who RSVP'd!  Why are we even pointing that out?  They haven't bought tickets, because they can't go. You didn't check with them before planning the date, because you expect that they can drop everything in their lives to revolve around your schedule.  They have every right to be super hurt because you didn't think to make sure they could attend your big day.\n\nYes, this will be a huge issue for years to come.  I would consider cancelling and moving the date, whether or not you can get your money back.  Maybe I'm extreme.  But your mom will literally be angry with you, and you'll be resentful at her, for the \\*rest of your life\\* if you don't.  That's not worth it.  So at minimum, just try to show some empathy that your brother won't be able to go to his own sister's wedding, instead of being angry at your family!  You're mad at your Mom for being mad that she can't attend your wedding!  No wonder she thinks you don't care -- you never even told her that you really want her there.  TELL HER NOW if that's how you feel, because based on your actions, she validly doesn't know that.  It may save your relationship.\n\nPut differently, weddings are huge things not just for you, but also for your families, who are joining together as well as you ... Of course yes it is your day!  But that day can be and is often SUPER meaningful for many other people other than just the two of you.  As it should be.  Marriage is a huge commitment.  The important people want to be there for it.  Provided you have any sort of non-totally-dysfunctional relationship with them, treat them like that's how you feel about it, too.  For someone like me, that included helping out our best man to make it to our destination wedding financially, for making our wedding on a Sunday morning so that people could fly in/out and not miss work if they didn't have vacation. That level of accommodation no one expects, of course, but I'm just giving you an example so you can understand why your parents feel like you don't care about them. \n\nBut YTA for not even checking that your dates would work with your own parents before booking a wedding that will require people to take at least like 4 days vacation to another half of the world, and reacting angrily instead of sadly that they couldn't go, as if their entire schedules revolve around yours, as if they don't WANT to go to your wedding ... when practically, you didn't care either way and you're just going ahead with your plans regardless!", "YTA\n\nI agree with everyone pointing out you chose to force your siblings to interrupt their schooling for your wedding. Especially the HSers, that is not an OK ask.\n\nAnd you didn\u2019t even try to make it local. You chose a far away destination that is basically impossible to make work.\n\nIf I were your parents I would have said no from the start.", "You\u2019re N T A for having YOUR wedding WHEN and WHERE you want. You would be T A if you expect everyone to drop their life commitments to fly half way across the world for your wedding. It\u2019s an invitation not a summons, but prepare to be chastised by your family for not being considerate to their commitments before booking the place. On the flip side of it had been a Mexico wedding then I\u2019m sure they could\u2019ve done the quick weekend trip for the wedding, but you bent to their will on that and changed the venue to make it nearly impossible for them to go. Your family really dug their grave on that one.", "Slight YTA\n\nIf you really want specific people to attend your wedding or other big event, you really do need to check and see if they are free to attend the event on the date that you pick.\n\nTo your parents, you have chosen a location and a date over having your siblings attend. That\u2019s not what\u2019s going on from your post. \n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that you are much older than your siblings and at a different stage in life. Taking time off from work is a lot different from taking time off from school. And yeah, football is a big deal at some schools and missing a game is a big deal.\n\nTraditionally, couples got married in the bride\u2019s hometown, so your original plan to get married in Mexico was not really a destination wedding, just a traditional wedding.", "NTA -\n\nyour mom already got you to change the wedding location, now she's trying the date?  fuck that.  she's not getting married, you are.  she's not going to have your children and she doesn't get to pick the decorations either.  this isn't your mother's wedding day, it's yours.  you made the first mistake changing the destination.  don't make a second and change the date.  if my fianc\u00e9 was letting her mother boss her around like that I'd be considering not marrying her.  you have to draw boundaries between your parents and the new family your starting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnope.  furthermore, i don't care if your brother is the next payton manning, he can miss one f-ing high school football game for your wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfrankly, i'd be switching it back to mexico if she fights you anymore on this.", "NTA  and congratulations!  I'm so sorry your family will not be attending but thems the breaks.  \n\nHow about having a second reception local to her in December instead so she can have the party she so very much wants.", "YTA really. But just thoughtless really. Your siblings have school and you\u2019ve not taken the school holidays into account? Do you not want your siblings there? \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be considerate, it\u2019s your wedding, your choice, but you\u2019ve made it really difficult for your family to come and it wasn\u2019t necessary. \n\nWhere I live you are fined for taking kids out of school during term time, don\u2019t know about the US?", "This is a hard one. I'm gonna say NTA because it's your wedding and you can have it wherever and whenever you want. \n\nHowever,  travelling 10 hours by plane in the middle of the school year  is really a no-go for your siblings.  It would be nice, not required to have taken them into consideration.  This is one of those \"you'll understand when you have kids\"  things.", "nta - it sounds no matter what date and location your immediate family meaning your mom has something to complain about so you book it at a place and time that means them most to you and fiance.  it sounds like the wedding in itself seems to be inconviencing your mom siblings so you do what makes you happy", "Nta - it\u2019s a wedding not a jury summons.

Or sit down with the families and work out a time everyone can make it.", "YTA. For the destination wedding. For not choosing a summer wedding date when your siblings are on their summer break. It's like you don't want your family there. I sincerely doubt Italy is cheaper than the US to have the wedding. Now you are having all your guests fly to Europe and get the hotels. Making them spend thousands.", "NTA this is your parents issue. I highly doubt your brother or other siblings want to miss your wedding and would gladly pick that unless they're spoilt to shit.

Sheesh how narcissistic can they possibly be? Y'all are absolutely NTA, but your family needs to get over themselves. Yes destination weddings are often a bit of a pain to get to compared to ones closer to home. But well that's not really your problem unless you're desperate for certain people to come and they can't make it. Usually destination weddings are for couples who don't care too much about who can and can't make it, since it's difficult if not downright impossible to find a time where everyone can go.

Plenty of time to rearrange things for the wedding. Your mother was clearly never going to supportive of these wedding plans.

All of our friends and family are pretty well off, especially my mom who owns a very successful business.\n\nLast year I finally popped the question to my now fianc\u00e9. We were ecstatic and we started planning immediately.\n\nFor the destination we initially decided on my fianc\u00e9's hometown in Mexico. This is where the first issue started. My mom was questioning what there was to do around that area since they wanted to bundle the wedding with a vacation and she didn't see the location as \"ideal\". Second issue was that it wasn't fair that my fianc\u00e9's family got to have the wedding so close to their home when my family had to travel so far. So eventually we scratched Mexico as a destination spot and went with a more \"fair\" place where both sides had to travel. We ended up choosing Italy (believe it or not Italy is surprisingly affordable compared to the US). Note: We are paying for a 2 night stay in our venue for our immediate family including siblings (I have 6 my fianc\u00e9 has 2).\n\nFor the date, we chose our 5th anniversary which is October 2023. This date is sentimental to us and it was 18 months away at the time and long enough for everyone attending to plan their trip. This is where the largest issue ensued with my mom. She was extremely upset and blew up on me (putting it mildly) because the date that we chose for our wedding coincided with my brother's (16M) HS football games along with activities for my other three siblings (14M, 7F, 7F). They accused us of being selfish and inconsiderate for picking such an inconvenient date especially for my brother (16M) since he is the quarterback of his team. According to her, it was impossible for him to skip a single game or practice, leaving him out of the wedding. They have threatened to not attend our wedding unless we change the date to summer or December to accomodate my siblings. If we were to change it, it would increase the cost for us and guests significantly due to high travel season. We chose this date because it meant something to us and moving it was non-negotiable. My family still believes that we are targeting them and purposefully excluding them from the wedding.\n\nThis has been very hard for me since I am a very non confrontational person, but I am holding my ground. Everyone else is excited and very supportive. Over 40 people have already RSVP'd and started planning their trips but my parents have not even bought tickets yet. AITA for not changing my wedding date and by consequence excluding my brother?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH. \n\nEveryone, including you, is arguing about weddings; noone is thinking about being married. \n\nGo and elope if you want the travel, then figure out how to celebrate it with others. \n\nAnd all of you need a mediator to figure out how to have relationships rather than pissing matches.", ">This is where the first issue started.

You seriously cant expect your 4 school aged siblings to miss school because of this right? 2 are in high school, and depending on the school attendance is important and a wedding isn\u2019t really a good excuse not to go to school.

NTA.\n\nETA: Forgot to mention that the date doesn't fall on any birthdays or anniversaries of deaths either, only thing about it is that it's during the school year.

Honestly I have a Wedding Etiquette book from when I was planning mine and that is literally THE first thing in the book for a reason: 1. Check on the budget with your parents first, and 2. Choose a location and date, making sure the parents and anyone else super close (ie siblings, grandparents, probable-maid-of-honor) is free on those dates. Otherwise it causes huge issues. It has for generations. It\u2019s a big thing NOT to be there on your kid\u2019s wedding day especially if they\u2019re NOT eloping.

The more I think about this, the more it seems a very complicated way of trying not to have your parents there while acting like you did and trying to not forever ruin the relationship \u2026 but probably will anyway XD. The fianc\u00e9s are in a bit of a pickle here already. I hope they make a decision that is best for their long term relationships, both between each other and with their parents.", "Destination weddings should always come with the expectation that some people won't be able to make it. \n\nI think that's just the risk you take. clown  The family are going to have to fly six people to Italy at a time they don't want to be away for this, so they might just say nope.", "For sure you should consider your family\u2019s schedule.

They aren\u2019t just being dicks. Maybe it would be good to sit down (in person or on zoom, whatever) and talk to both sides parents and themselves, all together would be a good idea to plan. That being said, they might not all agree.\n\nI have a kid and want to be there on his wedding day if he gets married. But I would also try to consider the fact that it\u2019s his wedding and if the main problem was another one of my kids having football games.. I\u2019d try to be flexible and diplomatic in asserting my thoughts and needs. Maybe the original post is biased.. I can\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.

I also have had a wedding in my home town so I understand that planning off that too. \n\nI think assuming that they are trying to arrange things so that their parents can\u2019t come is a huge assumption that actually contradicts the actions they\u2019ve taken to make it work. \n\nThe point is that they\u2019re the ones getting married and if they want a destination wedding that is much more complicated and may even have to have a wedding abroad and a family ceremony at home, if they really want their daily to be there.

Like yes you won\u2019t please everyone! But I do feel like parents being there is kind of a non-negotiable? I guess that\u2019s the source of the problem, for both OP & their mom.

It has always been the case. My husband's cousin was from Cheshire, but we all had to travel to the groom's home in Scotland. Likewise my daughter from UK married an American, so her wedding was near his family in America. My family didnt wish to travel, even though a huge beach house was provided to stay in.

After that whole experience, I could understand why some couples elope.\n\nBottom line, it's your wedding, you're paying for it, and if they can't see fit to skip one high school football game or other non important activity with 18 months notice, then you may have to accept that they won't be at your wedding.

So it's usually the groom's family to travel. Plus, since your family is better off, yours should be expected to incur the costs. I'd recommend the Mexico wedding as at least one family wouldn't have to travel as this is what usually happens.\n4. It's not targeting it is just a matter of timing and logistics. They would be the ones excluding themselves because of their misplaced sense of priorities. And again, it is usually the bride's side that gets deferred to.\n5. Your mom is acting like a Mother of the Bridezilla. The mother of the groom is supposed to be rational because it's not her baby girl who is getting married. Sorry mom that's just the way it is!\n6. \"This has been very hard for me since I am a very non-confrontational person.\" The problem is your mom is confrontational and you are right to nip it in the bud.

At that point, you have built enough of a yearly record to determine if you are college-potential, and you are staring down the barrel of playoff possibilities. Scouts look at your statistics, film, win-loss ratio, yards, pass-completions, etc. So in October, college scouts tend to be out watching potential players, in-person, at their games to see if their on-paper stats and their in-person ability line up. They can\u2019t do that if the player\u2019s *not there.* The missed game can also affect their stats - maybe less yards, points, etc. to tabulate, so in the tough competition between the thousands of boys hoping to play, brother loses an edge that might put him over to the scholarship territory.

When I was in high school, we could skip practices and/or games as long as our parents told the coach. My kids? Not at all. No spring break vacations with the family. One year, some kids couldn\u2019t go to prom (if they were asked) at a nearby school because they\u2019d have to miss a game. \n\nIf a kid is suspended for a certain numbers of games due to \u201cun excused absences,\u201d it could impact their place on the team for the rest of the year and the coming years.

There's probably no good time for bro during this critical school year, and it sounds like they wouldn't be able to afford the destination wedding if they waited past off-season, so this is a no-win.", "I think the mom sucks for the \u201cit\u2019s not faaair\u201d complaint about Mexico, but I do think OP could be kind of an asshole for picking a time his family can\u2019t make it. If you have a good relationship with family (which OP may not), I think it would be hurtful to feel neutral about them coming. \n\nAlso (unpopular Reddit opinion) weddings are certainly *about* the couple and they should enjoy themselves, but they\u2019re *hosting* guests \u2014 and hosting includes being mindful of your guests\u2019 experience too.", "Yes. Some of those reasons more valid than others. \"He can't miss *football*;for gods sake!\" Is not the same as \"come on, we obviously can't take all four of your siblings out of school for over a week any time of year.\"  There's also that they're threatening their lack of attendance, not just declining the invite.", "Yeah, but the problem isn't that OP is upset at the parents for not coming, it's that the parents are yelling at the OP over not scheduling for them. I'm not getting the impression that their non-attendance would ruin OP's wedding for them. Seems like going \"OK, guess we won't see you then\" then reducing contact might be the easiest solution.", "Then don\u2019t be mad if the people traveling can\u2019t come! Especially if you intentionally schedule it at a time that\u2019s inconvenient. Totally okay to have a destination wedding (especially in the case where people will have to travel no matter what). Totally NOT okay to expect everyone in your life to prioritize your wedding above whatever is going on in theirs. \n\nGet married close to home or understand that there will be a number of people that can\u2019t make it to your wedding. Destination weddings don\u2019t make you an AH, it\u2019s the expectation and anger when people can\u2019t come that creates the AH situation", "It\u2019s a lot cheaper *for you*. But your family probably doesn\u2019t have as many credit card points as you do, also has to buy tickets for six people rather than two, and still has to pay for at least two hotels rooms for at least 4-5 days. Plus the incompatibility with their schedules.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely an asshole move to be upset with them for not being able to go \u2014 that\u2019s a risk of significantly distant destination weddings. But even if you aren\u2019t upset, if you do have a good relationship with them, I couldn\u2019t blame them for being hurt that you feel neutrally about them coming.", "YTA - Unless you have a not so great relationship with your parents, you\u2019re an AH for making it impossible for them to attend. You sound extremely inconsiderate of your guests. You\u2019ve still chosen a place that will be cold and rainy in the off season.", "You know it was cheaper, because it is cold and rainy there at the time of the year, right?", "Yeah, I caught a whiff of \"The little brown girl is not right for my son\" from this post.", "Man, some of these folks never played sports and it shows. OP is NTA cuz they can do whatever they want with their wedding. That said, let me break it down for those of you who didn\u2019t play sports or sports at a higher level. We don\u2019t know the level of competition brother is or his level of commitment or if he is being recruited etc. Just cuz the family is well off doesn\u2019t mean they can easily afford a scholarship. Even if they can, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d still prefer for school to be free. If he is a fringe prospect, missing a game for something not football related can very much scare away potential recruiters. Good tape makes a huge difference. Missing school for a week or more effects grades as well. Some kids can catch up, some can\u2019t. Recruiters look at gpa as well as commitment to school, team, and even outside commitments when evaluating. Depending on the kid and their desire, these things can all play a part in their future. Do they have to go to a JUCO instead of a 4 year? Do they stop playing all together after they graduate? Tackle football isn\u2019t a sport most people are able to keep playing past hs. To some kids it matters, to others it doesn\u2019t.\n\nHis teammates by default make up a huge part of his social circle and they may hold a grudge. Heck, it may make up a big portion of the parents social circle as well if they are involved in boosters etc. QB misses the games and they lose, on a poor team, maybe it\u2019s not a big deal but on a team that may be undefeated, vying for a championship, even trying to improve to go above .500 can all be big deals. Leader of the team bails out and they lose, there\u2019s bound to be some resentment somewhere. These are hs kids with hs emotions. Something like this could have a wide ripple effect. Winning record is sometimes the difference in a coach keeping his job or being fired. Whole program being revamped, amount of attention paid by colleges etc.  I can keep going down the rabbit hole but I\u2019m just trying to open people\u2019s eyes to an outside perspective. Dunno what the commitments are of the other siblings but they can have the same ripple effect in their world as well. Maybe it\u2019s misplaced, but this is still the reality one way or another.\n\nLastly, for people saying he can just stay with a friend etc. That\u2019s a huge imposition. Maybe not one they are comfortable with as parents. I wouldn\u2019t leave my child behind if I were leaving the country, nor would I feel comfortable with splitting the family for a week or more. Well off or not, that may be the family vacation budget for the year or the next few years and some of the family aren\u2019t able to enjoy it.", "I had to scroll way too far to find this response.", "I teach high school and most of my students are PISSED when their families take them out of school for multiple days to vacation or whatever. It\u2019s really hard for kids who miss that much school to catch up on what they missed.\n\nMost kids have 6-7 classes. That\u2019s 5 days worth of work/quizzes/tests to make up and coordinate with a teacher times at least 6. Plus we\u2019ve had kids who miss a concert or something and if it\u2019s a non-excused absence they fail band or choir for the quarter. \n\nIt\u2019s super stressful for teenagers to miss that much school, regardless of whether they\u2019ll be \u201cin trouble.\u201d", "PSATs are in junior year, often around this time. They can get scholarships out of that test too. \nI agree with you 100%", "As a former high school teacher, I\u2019d argue that since the current 14-year old would be a freshman, these absences could tank that kid\u2019s high school GPA right out of the gate.  There are two kids who will be significantly impacted.", "Right?  Nothing super overt, but it's hard to to veer that direction given the difference.  It's never a problem for the ones in the relationship, and it never seems like a problem to their families...while they're dating.  But once marriage talk and planning and all that comes along the bigotry, if it exists, starts to seep out.", "He still may want to play college football. Losing his spot would be a problem.", "Homecoming is almost always a patsy opponent and the water boy could play QB and win.", "I thought I took something junior year also, it must've been those. No idea what the score was though lol but I bossed the actual a year later", "In the US it varies widely by state and by school district. If they accept a family vacation as an \"excused absence\" it might be fine. If they don't, it might seriously impact the kid's grades (like getting 0s on major exams resulting in a D average instead of an A).\n\nAt my kids' school, if they have 10 or more days unexcused, they fail the class *and* as the parent you risk being criminally charged for truancy, because you are legally responsible for getting the kid to school.\n\nThis literally happened to me one year when my kid had a long bout of nausea/diarrhea and I kept him out of school - I had even sent them doctor's notes but they wanted to see notes that explicitly said \"[Kid] should be excused from Oct. 10-18\" instead of \"I saw him in the ER on Oct. 13 and he was very sick and had been sick for several days, and I told his mom to keep him out of school.\" I was literally contacted by the police & the DA over this and told to appear in court.\n\nLuckily I was able to go back to the doctor and get them to write the school another letter explaining things, and they dropped the charges. But if I'd just been taking him on vacation? That would be a different story.", "Where in the US is a wedding a good reason to endanger someone\u2019s grades and take a week off in the middle of the fall?", "Oh, no. The horror of an unexcused absence.", "But it\u2019s a big school event and he\u2019s a student athlete.", "Well, at my school you can fail with too many I excused absences :(", "About 18 months ago. They may have been more strict as your son was gcse years.", "Possibly, but a friend's son got a lot of hassle at age 13 (pre Covid) for taking 3 days after a footie injury", "I honestly think it\u2019s down to the school itself. Same as anything really. Some are more strict with uniform and homework, others aren\u2019t. Luckily we got one that isn\u2019t. Though they\u2019ve changed heads since we went so maybe we wouldn\u2019t be as lucky next time (I\u2019ll still do it tho. The fine isn\u2019t anywhere as bad as the price increase)", "October is homecoming time. That is a big deal in high school and middle school. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that when you set the wedding is important because it means who can and can not come. Your wedding is not more important than their life. Your brother probably thinks his games are more important than some wedding. His responsibilities are important. He is the captain of the team.  He can easily harm his future if he comes to your wedding. \n\nAnd I would not leave a teenager during homecoming season alone in my house. That is asking for trouble.\n\n It is up to you if the date is more important than your parents and siblings coming. They are not ah. Neither are you. \n\nNAH", "ESH. Your family, and mom specifically, are out of line to start dictating wedding locations/events. It's your event, and if you're paying, you have the final say.\n\nThat said, the problem of picking a date meaningful to you and only you, and going to a distant location, is that in effect, you've put a series of burdens on friends and family, which isn't a great thing to do to a guest. Sure, you could have a wedding mid-week for example, if that date is meaningful to you... but it puts everyone else in a difficult position in terms of travel, time off from work, etc. If you brother is playing competitive sports, and is a key member of the team, there likely are (potentially severe) repercussions for missing a game. Giving two nights at a hotel is very generous, but still forces a bunch of costs and logistical hurdles on the guests. I'm looking at airfare to Italy for an upcoming family function in the fall, and it ain't cheap! That's a big ask to make of family.\n\nThe basic truth of a destination wedding is that sure, plan what you want... but be prepared when people can't make it.", "I feel like this depends on what your reaction would be if your siblings and parents can\u2019t make it. I feel like you can make your wedding wherever and however you want, but you can\u2019t be upset or surprised when some people aren\u2019t able to make it. Imo, a wedding is about celebrating your love for someone else. if you wanna celebrate your love in Italy or a mexico or wherever then that is your right to do so, and no, you\u2019re not in the wrong for not bending over backwards to accommodate your family\u2019s schedule as some people here seem to think. Your brother is not going to fail out of school for missing a few days, although I guess it depends on where they live. People at my school used to take off a week for vacation and no one bat and eye, no one failed either.", "NTA, but I think you are confused about US weddings.  US weddings *can be* expensive, or they can be extremely affordable.  I've been to plenty of weddings in a church with the reception in the church activity room with food brought by the congregation and a cake made by a family friend.", "Moderate YTA. Either elope or be considerate of your family. You think everyone should adjust their important events for your important event. There will be over 2 million US weddings the year you get married. And most of those other 2 million couples are working with families to pick dates that work for the majority. You are not special. And your statement about picking a certain date. Well, I really don\u2019t have much sympathy. Prioritize your needs, and don\u2019t make everything a priority 1. And you have schooled age siblings. If you want a destination wedding, and you want your siblings involved, don\u2019t pick a date during the school year FGS. And especially not during prime sports season. You really come across as very selfish/entitled.", "On balance I think YTA. Destination weddings always strike me as inconsiderate because of the cost it imposes on guests. If you\u2019re paying for accommodation and presumably travel that\u2019s very nice of you, but I think you need to recognise time is also a commodity. Mexico seems like a more accessible option.", "Weddings are so stupid lol. The amount of drama generated over a \"Look at us! We're in love!\" ceremony is so insane to me.", "ESH - When you have a destination wedding don't be mad when people can't come. \nTheir lives and the events in them are as important to them as your life is to you.", "YTA. Get married privately on your preferred date, and have the destination wedding at a time of year when your closest family is able to attend. No one with kids in school is flying to Italy for ONE WEEKEND in the middle of the school year, are you insane?", "YTA\n\nWeddings in the US can be extremely inexpensive, you just gotta put some work into it", "Your mom may not have behaved well, but she\u2019s not lying about the 16yr old not being able to attend. HS sports or performance activities can be very serious and the instructor drills into them from early on that they cannot miss any events. Combine that with an international destination wedding where the teen cannot reasonably be left alone for days and you make it impossible for them to attend. Not to mention taking all the children out of school for the trip is not easy. At this point it doesn\u2019t sound like the date can be changed, but also understand they\u2019re upset because they cannot attend. Everyone or no one is the AH here.", "You can have your wedding when you want, but it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out your family would be excluded from a destination wedding in the middle of the school year. It looks more like you just didn\u2019t gaf.", "Your mother was unhappy with your original plans, so you changed it to two days, halfway around the planet, in the middle of football season. You can plan your wedding any way you like, but it does indeed sound like you are \u201ctargeting and excluding.\u201d It also seems a little vengeful. YTA.", "NAH but destination weddings are exceedingly selfish.", "Amen!", "I\u2019m sorry, is little brother getting married? Is OP\u2019s mother getting married? NOPE. Sure OP has to be okay with his family missing it, but they did originally want a much closer location (Mexico) and mom complained about that, but OP and fiance want a destination wedding, and its THEIR WEDDING, not anyone else\u2019s. Anyone who wants to pitch a fit about it can suck it tbh, especially someone who was being difficult about it from the beginning and wanting to turn it into a vacation for herself. OP is definitely NTA.\n\nAlso\u2026 Am I missing something or did they say 2 night stay, not a week ?", ">Anyway, your brother definately can skip a game. You know why? Because its a game. \n\nIn brother's defense he might trying to get a scholarship, so the game would be important, especially since football is a short season every game is important. Also when you're on a team you have a responsibility to your teammates, and missing a game would be letting them down.\n\nNone of this makes any excuse for OP mothers actions, and OP gas every right to choose what date and location they want.", "In most places in the US, grade school is out all/part of June, July, all/part of August, a week for fall break, two weeks at the end of the year, and a week for spring break. There are plenty of options. \n\nOP is not obligated to plan around the family, but it\u2019s pretty dumb to expect kids to miss a week of school without at least talking to the parents first.", "They didn't really compromise by changing the venue because they changed it to a place that would make it even more difficult for people to make a short trip.\n\nOP can pick whatever date he wants, but he can't pick arguably the most inconvenient situation for his family (without talking to them about availability) and *then* complain about them not wanting to come.  Which is what he's doing here.", "This. Regardless of whether or not mom is overbearing and the one kid misses football the younger siblings are going to miss school assuming they are in the US. While OP is free to do whatever as it\u2019s his wedding he must know that this date makes it hard on the kids. Seems a bit selfish to me TBH.", "I didn't play sports of any kind, but in no possible universe would my parents have allowed me to skip a full week of school to travel to Europe. OP has 4 school-aged siblings. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to discern that OCTOBER is going to be an extremely inconvenient time for them to attend his international wedding. There's a reason those dates are cheap, dude. \n\nI'm going NAH because it's OP's wedding and he can plan it however he wants. But if you plan a destination wedding, you have to understand that some people won't be able to come. You have to accept that. And most people do consider what dates/ times will be more convenient for their guests. This is why more weddings take place at 3 PM on a Saturday than 3 AM on a Wednesday. With a very tiny amount of forethought, you would understand that a wedding in Italy in October is going to be massively inconvenient for your parents and 4 school-aged siblings. Do what you want, but you are the one who sent a very clear message that your family's attendance is not a priority for you. You don't get to cry foul that someone isn't coming to your destination wedding in general, but especially when you have planned it in the most inconvenient manner possible.", "I think because the mom intended to tack a vacation onto the wedding plans is what is really the issue here. Clearly, she wants OP to have the wedding during the summer vacation or whatever.", "Yeah but the family can miss the game. He\u2019s 16 (he\u2019ll be 17 then). He\u2019s not a kid. He can deal with a weekend a way and a game without parents there.", "Honestly,  I wouldn't have missed a practice for a trip in high school during football season. And I wasn't trying to get a scholarship or the quarterback. It becomes your life.  He can miss the wedding though,  he's 16.", "I agree with you.", "Yes, my youngest keeps bringing them home and they make the rounds through the family! Get rid of one and there's another starting!", "NTA. No. I feel like most people saying ESH and YTA is american. Your bride is from Mexico so the wedding would be a destination wedding for one side of the couple no matter what. This is not just a luxury. Your mom complained about not having it somewhere she could spend a while and travel around, so you chose Italy. She shot herself in the foot because you can easily travel from the US to Mexico for a weekend and come back. \nI think you could postpone the wedding to have your family there, but if guests are already booking tickets, that\u2019s not a possibility anymore.", "You apparently don't work in a school system in America.  Do you know how common this is?  I have parents pull kids for 2 weeks for Disney in October.  Sports teams gets pulled for a week to go half way across the country for a competition..   It's called educational trips.  You get your work in advance. Kids get pulled a lot for lesser activities. This will have zero impact on him academically or with his ability to get into college.", "I get your point, but OP\u2019s mum literally made a fuss because it WAS in Mexico. It would\u2019ve been easier in Mexico for *everyone* but she complained it wasn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d ??", "See that\u2019s what I don\u2019t get. Everyone is focusing on the high schooler that plays football but what about the other 3 kids? Who watches them? Don\u2019t they have school? Also even if parents get permission to pull them out what a headache to get the assignments caught up. I think OP is TA because its a big ask of his family. It\u2019s fine if he wants that date but he should stop whining about his mom not coming. She has a responsibility to the other 4 kids, football or not.", "Why does the brother have to go to the wedding? If he wants to play football instead that's his choice", "Yeah, this to me is the problem. He needs to be ok with the decision his mom made on behalf of his siblings.", "Right? I have to agree. Also the wedding could\u2019ve taken place in Mexico which is 100 percent doable over a weekend. Kids can miss one or two days of school. Pretty much anywhere in the continental United States is a reasonably short flight to Mexico. The issues with Mexico were that a) it wasn\u2019t fair to OPs family and b) there weren\u2019t enough touristy activities to make the wedding trip a vacation? They had bs excuses from the jump. OP and their partner change the destination in an act of good faith and it\u2019s still an issue albeit for more reasonable reasons this time though I think that\u2019s just a coincidence. They were always going to find a reason not to go. I would just make peace with the fact that my immediate family wouldn\u2019t be there. Their loss. And as someone who is American but the child of Mexican parents welcome to the family dude. We are generally a warm and welcoming people and we are happy to have you! Congratulations on your special day! I am sure it will be beautiful.", "I agree, they need to tell her to pound sand and do what they want. I do want to point out a potential caveat that only applies to the brother though: if he\u2019s the starting QB at 16 he\u2019s probably a pretty good player. It\u2019s POSSIBLE that he could be hoping for an athletic scholarship to college, in which case missing a game becomes a bigger deal. An athlete hoping to get noticed by a scout is not gonna want to miss any chance to start, especially in their senior year. \n\nEven if that is the case though that\u2019s only a pass for him. Extracurriculars for the younger siblings really shouldn\u2019t even enter the discussion.", "didnt ops mom say she was wanting to combine the destination wedding +  a vacation? thays prolly why everyone says a week from school for a \"wedding\" its a dual trip but theyre just shortening it to wedding", "Cause Mexico is so safe for Americans these days.  Especially away from the resort areas.", "I wouldn't let my kids miss a week of school for a destination wedding.\n\nStop being ridiculous. There is a reason, other than good weather, that most people choose to have their weddings in the summer. It's so people don't have to worry about their kids missing school, exams, varsity games... etc.\n\nOP can do whatever they like with their wedding, but they should not be offended that their mother can't come when she has 4 other children to think of.", "I remember there was a kid in my hs classes who missed like a whole month for a family vacation, I remember being so surprised that he could even do that lol", "They\u2019ve invested half the year into a 10 game season. They\u2019ve sacrificed fun with friends after school, parts of their summer, a physical toll on their bodies, even money in some cases.
