All of our friends and family are pretty well off, especially my mom who owns a very successful business.\n\nLast year I finally popped the question to my now fianc\u00e9. We were ecstatic and we started planning immediately.\n\nFor the destination we initially decided on my fianc\u00e9's hometown in Mexico. This is where the first issue started. My mom was questioning what there was to do around that area since they wanted to bundle the wedding with a vacation and she didn't see the location as \"ideal\". Second issue was that it wasn't fair that my fianc\u00e9's family got to have the wedding so close to their home when my family had to travel so far. So eventually we scratched Mexico as a destination spot and went with a more \"fair\" place where both sides had to travel.

This date is sentimental to us and it was 18 months away at the time and long enough for everyone attending to plan their trip. This is where the largest issue ensued with my mom. She was extremely upset and blew up on me (putting it mildly) because the date that we chose for our wedding coincided with my brother's (16M) HS football games along with activities for my other three siblings (14M, 7F, 7F). They accused us of being selfish and inconsiderate for picking such an inconvenient date especially for my brother (16M) since he is the quarterback of his team. According to her, it was impossible for him to skip a single game or practice, leaving him out of the wedding. They have threatened to not attend our wedding unless we change the date to summer or December to accomodate my siblings. If we were to change it, it would increase the cost for us and guests significantly due to high travel season. We chose this date because it meant something to us and moving it was non-negotiable. My family still believes that we are targeting them and purposefully excluding them from the wedding.\n\nThis has been very hard for me since I am a very non confrontational person, but I am holding my ground. Everyone else is excited and very supportive. Over 40 people have already RSVP'd and started planning their trips but my parents have not even bought tickets yet.

If your family is going to be annoying anyway at least go with what you want 100 percent.", "[deleted]", "Thats the problem with destination wedding, in order for people to make it they need to mess with stuff in there lives. Not a quick thing on the weekend they need to plan like a week and take off work and other annoying things. The more kids people have the harder it is, money wise and planning wise\n\nNAH", "I don't really know if I can grade this one. Your parents are AH for being this controlling about the wedding, and giving you ultimatums. But this is the issues with destination weddings, especially when you have four school age siblings and it's during the school year. It's your wedding and you can plan it how you want, but destination weddings always leave somebody out. Your mom is correct that your brother really can't miss games during high school football season, so realistically he is excluded no matter what. \n\nIt just seems like a tough situation all around and this is what comes out of destination weddings. They are great if you have guests without school age kids who can afford it. But with 4 young siblings, scheduling in the middle of the school year was bound to cause problems for them.\n\nEdit: going with ESH. You are probably locked into your date now because of sunk costs, but you saying it's \"non-negotiable\" because of symbolic significance puts that ahead of your family's practical ability to get there. Again, it's your wedding and you are not obligated to schedule around anyone, but you also can't be mad then if they don't come and it strains the family relationship.", "You can do what you want in the end, but you have no right to be upset when they don't come.", "NAH. Your wedding, your choice of date and destination. But just don't be suprised or upset when 1 or more of your parents and at least your 16 bro isn't there. Besides football, junior year is college prep year. Also, your 14 bro will be in his 1st semester of HS; he may not want to miss out on anything. The two 7 sisters probably wouldn't miss anything in school.", "ESH. Unfortunately you do have school aged siblings so you should have considered that when planning. I understand that the date is special to you, but it's not really that simple to just take kids out of school for a week in the middle of a semester. That is a really long time to miss whatever they're learning in class- which can be difficult to make up at home.\n\nI'm not sure how Italy is somehow a compromise between Mexico and the US, either.\n\nYour parents are kind of being jerks by getting you to change the destination, though. It's not their wedding, they really shouldn't have so much influence over the venue, especially if they're not paying for it and the travel part isn't an issue. They're also being a bit silly about you \"targeting\" them somehow.", "NAH/YTA. You can\u2019t expect your parents to drop everything during the school year when they have school age children, to fly across the Atlantic for a destination wedding. You have to consider low attendance when you choose a destination wedding. I still don\u2019t see how a wedding in Italy is cheaper than stateside. Plane tickets alone are $$$", "ESH - it was pretty rude and unreasonable for your mom to get upset about having the wedding in your fianc\u00e9s home town in Mexico. It\u2019s very common that one side of the family to travel for a wedding. \n\nYou have 3 siblings who are in school and you planned a destination wedding right in the middle of the school year! What on earth were you thinking? Do you like your siblings? Do you even want them at your wedding? They\u2019re just kids, what did they ever do to you? I bet they look up to you and would really like to be there on your special day. it\u2019s very selfish and cruel to exclude them like that and cause all that drama for your parents.", "You chose a destination wedding during the school year when you have siblings on school. You knew what you were doing. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you want your family to attend your wedding, their schedules have to matter to you. If you don\u2019t care if your family is there, be clear on that.\n\nIt sounds like you want to elope but you\u2019re too disrespectful to just say it.", "You have four siblings in school, and made the choice to arrange a wedding half way around the planet during the middle of the school term.\n\nTwo of your siblings are in high school. There is zero chance I'd be taking my high school kids out of class for a week or more in the middle of term for a vacation. If I was your parent, I wouldn't be coming to your wedding, because I'd need to stay at home with my school-aged kids who were attending school.\n\nSounds like you just assumed that your parents and siblings would be OK with blowing off a week of school in order to fly half way around the planet to see you get married. Looks like you assumed wrong. School dates are well known, and are not subject to negotiation. Your brother can't plan to not have school that week, even if he knows 18 months in advance. That's not how schools work.\n\n(It's absurd to fly from the US to Europe for 2 nights. Have you not heard of jet lag at all? I've done business trips like this, and it's possible, but brutal. It's not something I would actually do by choice.)\n\nYTA", "I may be in the minority here YTA here.  For many of the things you said, like choosing to plan the wedding at a destination, etc. you're totally NTA; but one of the first rules of etiquette is that before you set the date you make sure that your close family can be there, if you want them there.  Other people's lives continue on, and they may have unavoidable conflicts, even if you are getting married.  It's not like the world just stops and people can just go to Italy at literally anytime just because you're getting married there.\n\nYTA for not checking if they could make it on this \\*huge\\* trip at the time when you wanted them to go.  If you don't do that, it's valid for them to feel that you didn't care enough whether or not they could make it, to even check if they could.  Which it honestly sounds like you kind of don't care -- if your parents can't go, who cares about those 40 people who RSVP'd!  Why are we even pointing that out?  They haven't bought tickets, because they can't go. You didn't check with them before planning the date, because you expect that they can drop everything in their lives to revolve around your schedule.  They have every right to be super hurt because you didn't think to make sure they could attend your big day.\n\nYes, this will be a huge issue for years to come.  I would consider cancelling and moving the date, whether or not you can get your money back.  Maybe I'm extreme.  But your mom will literally be angry with you, and you'll be resentful at her, for the \\*rest of your life\\* if you don't.  That's not worth it.  So at minimum, just try to show some empathy that your brother won't be able to go to his own sister's wedding, instead of being angry at your family!  You're mad at your Mom for being mad that she can't attend your wedding!  No wonder she thinks you don't care -- you never even told her that you really want her there.  TELL HER NOW if that's how you feel, because based on your actions, she validly doesn't know that.  It may save your relationship.\n\nPut differently, weddings are huge things not just for you, but also for your families, who are joining together as well as you ... Of course yes it is your day!  But that day can be and is often SUPER meaningful for many other people other than just the two of you.  As it should be.  Marriage is a huge commitment.  The important people want to be there for it.  Provided you have any sort of non-totally-dysfunctional relationship with them, treat them like that's how you feel about it, too.  For someone like me, that included helping out our best man to make it to our destination wedding financially, for making our wedding on a Sunday morning so that people could fly in/out and not miss work if they didn't have vacation. That level of accommodation no one expects, of course, but I'm just giving you an example so you can understand why your parents feel like you don't care about them. \n\nBut YTA for not even checking that your dates would work with your own parents before booking a wedding that will require people to take at least like 4 days vacation to another half of the world, and reacting angrily instead of sadly that they couldn't go, as if their entire schedules revolve around yours, as if they don't WANT to go to your wedding ... when practically, you didn't care either way and you're just going ahead with your plans regardless!", "YTA\n\nI agree with everyone pointing out you chose to force your siblings to interrupt their schooling for your wedding. Especially the HSers, that is not an OK ask.\n\nAnd you didn\u2019t even try to make it local. You chose a far away destination that is basically impossible to make work.\n\nIf I were your parents I would have said no from the start.", "You\u2019re N T A for having YOUR wedding WHEN and WHERE you want. You would be T A if you expect everyone to drop their life commitments to fly half way across the world for your wedding. It\u2019s an invitation not a summons, but prepare to be chastised by your family for not being considerate to their commitments before booking the place. On the flip side of it had been a Mexico wedding then I\u2019m sure they could\u2019ve done the quick weekend trip for the wedding, but you bent to their will on that and changed the venue to make it nearly impossible for them to go. Your family really dug their grave on that one.", "Slight YTA\n\nIf you really want specific people to attend your wedding or other big event, you really do need to check and see if they are free to attend the event on the date that you pick.\n\nTo your parents, you have chosen a location and a date over having your siblings attend. That\u2019s not what\u2019s going on from your post. \n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that you are much older than your siblings and at a different stage in life. Taking time off from work is a lot different from taking time off from school. And yeah, football is a big deal at some schools and missing a game is a big deal.\n\nTraditionally, couples got married in the bride\u2019s hometown, so your original plan to get married in Mexico was not really a destination wedding, just a traditional wedding.", "NTA -\n\nyour mom already got you to change the wedding location, now she's trying the date?  fuck that.  she's not getting married, you are.  she's not going to have your children and she doesn't get to pick the decorations either.  this isn't your mother's wedding day, it's yours.  you made the first mistake changing the destination.  don't make a second and change the date.  if my fianc\u00e9 was letting her mother boss her around like that I'd be considering not marrying her.  you have to draw boundaries between your parents and the new family your starting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnope.  furthermore, i don't care if your brother is the next payton manning, he can miss one f-ing high school football game for your wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfrankly, i'd be switching it back to mexico if she fights you anymore on this.", "NTA  and congratulations!  I'm so sorry your family will not be attending but thems the breaks.  \n\nHow about having a second reception local to her in December instead so she can have the party she so very much wants.", "YTA really. But just thoughtless really. Your siblings have school and you\u2019ve not taken the school holidays into account? Do you not want your siblings there? \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be considerate, it\u2019s your wedding, your choice, but you\u2019ve made it really difficult for your family to come and it wasn\u2019t necessary. \n\nWhere I live you are fined for taking kids out of school during term time, don\u2019t know about the US?", "This is a hard one. I'm gonna say NTA because it's your wedding and you can have it wherever and whenever you want. \n\nHowever,  travelling 10 hours by plane in the middle of the school year  is really a no-go for your siblings.  It would be nice, not required to have taken them into consideration.  This is one of those \"you'll understand when you have kids\"  things.", "nta - it sounds no matter what date and location your immediate family meaning your mom has something to complain about so you book it at a place and time that means them most to you and fiance.  it sounds like the wedding in itself seems to be inconviencing your mom siblings so you do what makes you happy", "Nta - it\u2019s a wedding not a jury summons.

Or sit down with the families and work out a time everyone can make it.", "YTA. For the destination wedding. For not choosing a summer wedding date when your siblings are on their summer break. It's like you don't want your family there. I sincerely doubt Italy is cheaper than the US to have the wedding. Now you are having all your guests fly to Europe and get the hotels.

Usually destination weddings are for couples who don't care too much about who can and can't make it, since it's difficult if not downright impossible to find a time where everyone can go.

We have always been very vocal with everyone about having a destination wedding. We love to travel, and weddings in the US are VERY expensive. We are paying for everything ourselves and receiving no financial help from family. All of our friends and family are pretty well off, especially my mom who owns a very successful business.\n\nLast year I finally popped the question to my now fianc\u00e9. We were ecstatic and we started planning immediately.\n\nFor the destination we initially decided on my fianc\u00e9's hometown in Mexico. This is where the first issue started. My mom was questioning what there was to do around that area since they wanted to bundle the wedding with a vacation and she didn't see the location as \"ideal\". Second issue was that it wasn't fair that my fianc\u00e9's family got to have the wedding so close to their home when my family had to travel so far. So eventually we scratched Mexico as a destination spot and went with a more \"fair\" place where both sides had to travel. We ended up choosing Italy (believe it or not Italy is surprisingly affordable compared to the US). Note: We are paying for a 2 night stay in our venue for our immediate family including siblings (I have 6 my fianc\u00e9 has 2).\n\nFor the date, we chose our 5th anniversary which is October 2023. This date is sentimental to us and it was 18 months away at the time and long enough for everyone attending to plan their trip. This is where the largest issue ensued with my mom. She was extremely upset and blew up on me (putting it mildly) because the date that we chose for our wedding coincided with my brother's (16M) HS football games along with activities for my other three siblings (14M, 7F, 7F). They accused us of being selfish and inconsiderate for picking such an inconvenient date especially for my brother (16M) since he is the quarterback of his team. According to her, it was impossible for him to skip a single game or practice, leaving him out of the wedding. They have threatened to not attend our wedding unless we change the date to summer or December to accomodate my siblings. If we were to change it, it would increase the cost for us and guests significantly due to high travel season. We chose this date because it meant something to us and moving it was non-negotiable. My family still believes that we are targeting them and purposefully excluding them from the wedding.\n\nThis has been very hard for me since I am a very non confrontational person, but I am holding my ground. Everyone else is excited and very supportive. Over 40 people have already RSVP'd and started planning their trips but my parents have not even bought tickets yet. AITA for not changing my wedding date and by consequence excluding my brother?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My mom was questioning what there was to do around that area since they wanted to bundle the wedding with a vacation and she didn't see the location as \"ideal\".

You seriously cant expect your 4 school aged siblings to miss school because of this right? 2 are in high school, and depending on the school attendance is important and a wedding isn\u2019t really a good excuse not to go to school.
