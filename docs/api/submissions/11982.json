Do you understand how that makes you an AH?", "School-age kids taking a class at community college is common enough. Ten is unusual, but not unheard of - particularly for math, where kids that get it can bomb through the syllabus very quickly.\n\nIt's clear that most of the group is happy hanging out with the girl after math class. You don't want to spend time with her. You're not obliged to like everyone, and if you don't like this girl (or children in general), and so don't want to study with her, I suppose that's OK.\n\nGetting up and leaving when she asked to join the group was pretty obvious and pointed, though, and that makes you the AH here.\n\nYTA", "I agree with the NAH, though I think you are hurting yourself. You don't have to be part of a study group where you are not comfortable, but it sounds like this was a good group that was beneficial for you. \n\nI agree with other commenters that the nanny is the real problem. I work at a university that has had a few younger students - absolute geniuses who were much younger than standard college age (I'm not sure of the ages). Two siblings in particular graduated our university before they were 18. Their mother walked with them to classes and was there to help them out; it was awkward at times but it was probably the right move. They were geniuses but were also little kids (I have mixed emotions about having them go through school so early). I feel bad for this 10-year-old. It is probably incredibly difficult for her to navigate this situation.", "NTA\n\nYou don't like kids, and that's fine. You're telling your feelings about the kid to a neutral 3rd party that does not know the kid and will never interact with her, us. I don't mind the comments.\n\nAs long as you don't make those comments to the kid or those that know her, then I feel you're good.\n\nYou're handling the situation as best as you can. You remove yourself from the situation. You don't demand that a little kid goes somewhere else, so you're not inconvenienced.\n\nYou understand that while the situation sucks for you, the kid had limited options and has chosen to go to this group of adults that she trusts and you remove yourself to give her that. I respect that.", "NTA lol you don't have to be around a kid if you don't want to. You don't have to like how the vibe is different when she's there. You didn't say or do anything to her. You stopped going to something you enjoyed to fix your problem by yourself, without involving anyone else. \n\nIt's unfortunate they noticed. It's worse they *told her* what you were doing. But you're not obligated to be there if you don't want to be, and I don't think that makes you an asshole. Things are undeniably different when there's a kid present. Genius or not. That's why kids aren't allowed at certain parties. Or certain weddings. But this kid IS allowed to be at study group, so you removed yourself which is exactly what this sub would have told you to do if you had come and asked if you would be the asshole instead if of you already are. \n\nSo don't take all the ytas too hard lol", "Okay. Not everyone likes kids, that's just a fact of life. But you sound bitter like full on weirdly hateful.

That may have been inevitable but frankly - it\u2019s very odd that any of you were put in this situation. If the college is able to accommodate her educationally then they should be able to do *something* to provide adequate supervision and not have random students provide that labor (however easy it may be). If she was hurt or worse while in the study group, all of you would potentially be liable. I wouldn\u2019t want that.

If you don't like associating with someone or someone makes the vibes different then it's your right and none of their business to leave the situation.

That's how you get bitter. Fuck em. Don't be a dick to the kid but don't waste your time dealing with them.", "I will say YTA for your attitude regarding the girl being there. Have you considered that this is a scary thing for the girl to be in a place full of adults? \n\nHowever.... I commend your way of going about minimizing the issue so as not to create a huge issue, but the girl is there for the same reason you are.... to learn. The socializing is an added bonus.\n\nLastly, the nanny that is supposed to pick up the girl is an AH though, as well as the parents for not handling it, because leaving a 10 year old on campus is not the greatest idea. The parents should figure that out and not have to rely on the kindness of other students. You are not childcare.", "I mean you're hurting yourself by not studying, but NAH I guess. You don't have to attend any study group if you're not comfortable with it.\n\nIt does sound like you look at this as socializing more than studying, so maybe it's best you don't attend if you can't maintain focus.", "YTA. You're acting like a mean girl in middle school, leaving the lunch table because \"she\" showed up. Your disdain for this girl is spewed a over this post. You are supposed to be an adult, but you are the one acting like a child here. This kid has done nothing to you - except exist. She ruins your vibe? Welcome to life. Time to learn how to get along and work with people you don't like.\n\nOn the flip side, the only person you are hurting by not going to study group is YOU. Study on your own, then, or stay in your lane. Leave the kid alone and try practicing some manners.", "INFO: How drastically different is the study group when she\u2019s there? Does everyone study as normal and she just hangs out, or is the entire study session just a giant babysitting experience for everyone.", "NAH because if you don't want to be around someone then that's your prerogative.\nHowever, you are very clearly jealous of a 10 year old.", "NTA", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to not join the study group on the days you now she\u2019ll be there (which is ridiculous) but to get up and leave when she had to spontaneously join the group was just rude.

NTA for the way YTA.\n\nYTA for skipping a group hang because \u201cbaby genius\u201d is there. This is a kid who doesn\u2019t fit in with kids her age or the adults she goes to school with. She found a kind study group, and it sucks that you\u2019re so pissed off about it. You could just sit on the opposite end of the table as her. \n\nBut you avoided her in a way that kept your issue to yourself, and you\u2019re not obligated to attend events if you don\u2019t want to. But you should just reevaluate your problem with this girl.", "NAH\n\nIf you're not keen on hanging out with the kid, I don't see anything wrong with you choosing to do something else. You haven't actively tried to exclude her from the group, or complained to your friends; you've identified a situation you're not comfortable with and separated yourself from it rather than putting the onus for dealing with it on everyone else in the group. That sounds fairly mature to me. \n\nYou may have hurt the kid's feelings, but she's 10 so she's not emotionally prepared to process why you're not coming around. It would not make sense to me that a strangers lack of maturity should dictate where you set your boundaries. \n\nAs to your friends and your mom, they obviously don't agree with you stepping away, and think your behavior is unnecessarily exclusionary and harmful. On this point I honestly sort of agree. Your discomfort is a you issue, and stepping away from a work/social group because you can't handle being around a 10 year old is in my mind a little silly. \n\nHowever, that's just my opinion, and perhaps the opinion of your friends and family. While I think there's nothing wrong with them having and expressing those views, there's equally nothing wrong with you having your own and having boundaries based on your own comfort rather than the comfort of others.", "INFO - how many people in this study group? If its more than a few, you could still participate without having to interact with her very much.", "YTA for the way you use put downs to refer to her and generally think of her in some weird jealous way.  Some people don\u2019t like kids though, so if you were like I don\u2019t like the vibe when kids are around so I found something else to do, that would be fair.  Just don\u2019t be an AH about it like you were in your post.", "YTA and sound jealous af of a kid who\u2019s done nothing to you", "YTA - why is it such a problem she\u2019s there? Are you intimidated that someone so young is that smart?

You write so condescendingly about this girl who sounds like she\u2019s just trying to make friends and fit in. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s awkward for her too. I\u2019d expect an adult to treat a child with respect and not be annoyed by their mere existence. If she\u2019s smart enough for college level math and science then she\u2019s smart enough to be able to tell you don\u2019t like her. You need to get over yourself.

It's fine for you to not want to be around kids.", "YTA. You sound like a jerk. You\u2019re twice her age - why do you feel the need to include so many put downs about her in your post? Are you that insecure that a 10 year old is in the same class as you? You\u2019re not an AH for not wanting to hang out with her I guess, but you are a pathetic AH for how you\u2019re talking about a 10 year old in this post.", "YTA. Has this kid ever done anything to inconvenience you, other than being smart?", "You are being rude and making up names for a kid. Like grow up. YTA and I hope your study group keeps the kid. Seems like they traded up.", "NTA Why does it matter to them? You didn\u2019t even tell them she was the problem. You said you had to work. Whoever told everyone was out of line. They\u2019re the one who hurt her feelings.", "NAH. I don't understand the other responses because, in general, this forum sticks by the \"allow people to decide who they want to hang out with\" principle. You don't want to hang out with a kid. So don't. Just realize that means you won't be seeing as much of the other people in your class, so your social life could suffer for it.", "As an adult who was that kid, I have mixed feelings.\n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to always have study group involve a 10yo, but if she\u2019s in the class, it\u2019s a reasonable place for her to be. To leave every single time, but still expect to be in the group whenever it\u2019s convenient is\u2026 convenient. In the unkind way.\n\nTake the group as it is, or leave it. But the over attitude here is pretty unflattering to you.", "NTA. Ya you\u2019re tone is a little rude here but as long as you aren\u2019t saying it directly to the kid, you\u2019re good. Biggest asshole here is the parents. Poor kid, probably doesn\u2019t get a childhood\u2026 or actual FRIENDS her age.", "I have a BA, an MFA, a JD, and I completed my doctoral coursework (though I never wrote my dissertation).  I've also taught at the university level.  I think I have, at least, an informed opinion about studying and study groups. :)\n\nI am, frankly, surprised at the hostility shown to the OP.  The environment for learning is as important as the quality of instruction, and that includes study groups.  A relaxed, social study group is, for many people (including myself), an important learning tool.  A 10-year old may have the intellectual ability to master the material but, when it comes to a study group, may not have sufficient emotional or social maturity to participate constructively.  This has nothing to do with feeling \"threatened\" as some posters have claimed.  If, as the OP writes, the dynamic of the study group is changed to the point where it no longer provides an appropriate environment FOR THE OP, there is absolutely nothing wrong with her absenting herself from it.  This has nothing to do with compassion, or the lack of it.  Her \"job\" as a student is to learn the material.  It is not her responsibility to assist a young child at her own educational expense.  She did not insult the child, and either simply didn't attend when she knew the child was there, or left when she discovered the child was present.\n\nIn NYC in junior high, we had a program called \"SP\" for \"Special Progress.\"  It allowed children to skip 8th grade, going directly from 7th to 9th grade.  I was in this program.  Since the consequence of being in SP meant graduating high school a year earlier than normal, and then being one year younger than college classmates in the same year, the parents of the SP kids were consulted as to whether their kids possessed sufficient emotional and social maturity to succeed, and this addressed only a ONE YEAR age difference.  It is up to the parents of the child in the OP's study group to make that determination for their daughter; it is not the OP's obligation to compensate for what may have been a poor decision on the part of the child's parents.\n\nI fully understand the OP's frustration.  In my opinion, she is definitely NTA.  If anyone is an AH, it is the parents of the young girl for either misjudging their daughter's maturity, or leaving her ill-prepared to participate with other college students.", "I mean, you made it really obvious when you started packing up to leave as soon as she got there... I'm going to go with yes. It's fine to not really want to hang out with kids but it's not like you're stuck talking to only her in a group that big. Kind of sounds like you have an issue with her advanced learning, the way you describe her.   \nSo yeah, YTA.", "The ten year old is in ONE study group that you were in. One child in a sea of \"adults\". It doesn't sound like anyone else is bothered but you. I can only imagine how difficult it is for her in her social situation. Why can't you be mature and show some  compassion for her for a little while in a group setting? For one class that is only for a term or semester. YTA", "NTA- kids and young adults have different mindsets and maturity. Even if they are privileged enough to study at a higher level, most kids and adults don\u2019t have many things in common. It\u2019s weird for a child to be part of an adult study group really.", "YTA Another way to describe the situation is that you abandoned a study group because there was too much studying. The 10 year old eliminates the social aspects of the group. That makes sense.  It\u2019s fine if you just want to socialize. But a study group isn\u2019t the appropriate place to do that. Maybe the casual atmosphere is misleading but the intent of the group is still educational.", "YTA - Awww somebodies little feelings got hurt by the presence of the baby genius didn't they!! Hugely immature dudette....do better", "YTA.\n\nBut you\u2019re the only one missing out, so really you\u2019re an asshole to yourself.\n\nYour privilege.", "YTA, You don\u2019t have to like kids but that doesn\u2019t mean you can be mean to them, she didn\u2019t even do anything to you.

She's on a college campus! Are they seriously not concerned what could happen to her? What if there weren't a kind group of role models to let her hang with them? What if she just sat there alone? What if the college kids were creepy or a bad influence instead? If anyone is the A H, it's her guardians.)\n\nI think OP has options. She can either be honest (hopefully in a more tactful way; I get that she's venting here, but a softer version would be better for the study group) and ask if they can make arrangements to study or just socialize at a different time without a child. She can accept that the group is fine with this and deal with it, as well. Or she can just say,  yeah, not for me, and move on (find a different study group, etc.). I think any of these are fine, and I don't think there's anything wrong with being uncomfortable sharing your college time with a kid.

University would have be better. Which begs that question by go to college if OP is nothing but liking to learn other people different from her?\nAs for the child being young. That is the HUGE mistake. More often than not smart kids like don\u2019t have a childhood and are noticed thing around more often. Sure she may do childish things but no more than from the lack of impulsive control 20 year do. Giving the chance, the child would know more than OP. I don\u2019t mean academic wise. I am sure the child, know more about drugs and such. But again tha break the mold people think about kids. After all does OP really think the child doesn\u2019t know the risks she is facing being alone in a college campus? OP might be surprise the amount thinking the child does in their actions.

She is asking because she couldn\u2019t trust anyone beyond surface level- that being they are classmates they wouldn\u2019t hurt me so easily. can\u2019t ask any one for help because then they would kick out for being a child. \nAs the child items, it might be a desperate attempt from the parent for give her a childhood or pretend that their child is normal. Just like she might pretend them and be a child. To not freak people out. Because gifted kid like that are either thought to immature geniuses or creepy freaks. \nShe maybe legitimately like the princess and which OP\u2019s actions would only lead to stop getting them in effort to  seen more grown up. Especially she starts going deep into field where they would exclude for age, gender and maybe if she is minority, her culture. Killing her inner child which goes back the point how parent might struggle to give a semi normal life while still give her thing at her level. \nOP is making awkward and weird. The child knows her being stare constantly. All her actions are watch and measure. She is going off the people\u2019s cue around her. And OP is assume the child would be a child who would spill her juice on her homework. Going back to previous points. \nIt is true, OP may not like kids. That is fine and with in right. No one is against  that . But the disdain in the post, the passive aggression way she wrote the post and those comment, are filled with resent is too much. She could have treat the situation with more tact. Which is something OP should learn because there would situation where OP would feel uncomfortable but she wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.

I'm out, guys.\"\n\nThere's just no reason not to stick it out for *one* study session. A kid that smart is obviously going to pick up on the fact that OP hates her. If you wouldn't treat an emotionally mature adult like that, why is it okay to treat a kid like that?", "I mean its a study group to talk about math, no one was asking OP to hang out with the kid in a non-academic setting. They only have to be studying the same math.", "And also.... A child being left with strangers and then said strangers being responsible for them? When did they sign up for babysitting duties in college?", "This is exactly what misogynist men say about having women around.", "The social aspect is what op wants to experience, but if the study group is objectively about studying, the kid could be an asset and maybe op is the burden, who knows?", "This! I was a particularly smart kid growing up (both socially and school wise), and I honestly felt more comfortable around adults than I did kids my age at the time. I always loved it when the high school kids in my martial arts class were so willing to be friendly with me and have conversations that didn\u2019t belittle me, and when my mom\u2019s friends didn\u2019t try to exclude me and I got to be part of almost everything. They thought I was cool because I wasn\u2019t one of those \u201cannoying\u201d little kids.\n\nIf I were OP, I would welcome a 10 year old genius with open arms. One, because, that\u2019s less than a once in a lifetime opportunity, and two, because I know what it\u2019s like to be more comfortable with adults. Maybe that\u2019s why the rest of the study group likes her? Maybe she\u2019s great to converse with if you actually try.", "yeah, agreed. We were all kids once, we had to learn how to be adults, it's a process. But kids are... humans. They're just people. They live on this earth and they exist.\n\nThey're just like other humans.

What exactly did op do to the kid that you would never do?", "But OP hasn't been mean to the child..", "Yeah it probably really sucks for that girl and I get along with kids fine and would be fine but I do think I would be nervous about watching my mouth.

I was 10 when I was taking college algebra during the summer. I was way too shy to talk to anybody, never would have been able to join a study group. The first few sessions, I was shaking from nerves. Some of the college kids gave me a major side eye. I didn't have a fun backpack though, maybe that's why.", "That\u2019s literally bullying. Hopefully the kid didn\u2019t notice", "OP sounds so childish. Like... who's the mature one? The 10 year old who quietly finds a solution for her ride not showing up on time that lets her study with a group of students she knows from class and presumably feels somewhat comfortable around, or the 20 year old kid who stomps off because the 10 year old kid is making her jealous/cramping her style?\n\nOP... what can't you do at the study group that you want to do with a 10 year old there? Flirt? Act inappropriately? What part of the study group is being hindered by having someone younger than you there?\n\nAnd I'm feeling pretty old right now because to me, you're closer in age to the 10 year old. You're both children. Your brains aren't fully formed, you haven't stopped growing, you're still learning, you can't legally buy alcohol or rent a car. You have a LOT more in common with a 10 year old than you have in common with adults. So take a chill pill and take this opportunity to practice being a decent human being. Empathy is a muscle- you need to use it often in order to strengthen it. So try using empathy, and grow into a better person.", "She should join a new study group and, I suspect, almost certainly will.\n\nI'm not sure what your objection is to the way she dealt with the kid asking to join.  She went once and didn't like the dynamic.  She stopped going on those days when the kid was there.\n\nThe OP, herself, is college-aged, and there at college to learn critical thinking, nuanced expression, and reasoned logic.  I, on the other hand, am nearing 70 and have a bunch of college and graduate degrees.  I do not expect her, or any 1st or 2nd year community college student, to be able to write as articulately as I can.  \"Baby genius\" is a cultural reference -- there was a movie by that name.  That's how I understood it, and certainly not as condescending.\n\nAnd jealous?  Of what?  If they're in the same class, they have, roughly, the same intellectual capability.\n\nAs I mentioned, I skipped 8th grade and graduated high school at 16.  Trust me, NO ONE in college was jealous of me except, perhaps, because I had a really cute girlfriend my freshman year who was a little over a year older than me -- I was dating an older woman! :)", "They\u2019re not babysitting her.

Heaven forbid this girl try to connect with her classmates by sharing her hobby.", "Shame on the nanny for being irresponsible, but if you want to help you can try and contact the mother about the nanny's irresponsibility, or at least treat the kid with kindness. It's pretty rude to actively avoid someone, even if they are half your age.", "The way shes talking about the kid right now is mean spirited", "You did nothing wrong. You weren't mean to the child directly, and you extricated yourself from an otherwise untenable situation. Your time is your own, and you don't owe your presence to anyone. For the record, I wouldn't want to hang around with the kid and the dynamic they bring either. That being said? Find a new study group. The one you were previously a part of no longer seems like a welcoming place for you. Everyone here is worried about the child's feelings, but you are also in no way obligated to remain a part of a group that clearly has no concerns for yours as well.

Is it the same type of friendship as the ones I had with kids my age? Of course not. But kids are people, too, and when I was like 9-12, my best friend was a little old lady in the neighborhood.

Same way as \"kids should be able to be in the spaces\" is the same way OP should be able to go and do what they want where they want with who they want on a college campus away from children so to act like this is normal, is crazy.

Can't really pinpoint anything that changes just the overall attitude which is weird it's a study group not a hang out.  I understand you can't bring up certain subjects around kids but it's an actual college study group not an episode of \"Community\", how much of a difference can there be.  They just have to keep their language PG.  Maybe she isn't jealous just my opinion/conjecture.\n\nEdit:Also just wanted to comment on the baby genius thing you say it is a cultural reference.

I have no problem with avoiding someone because you don\u2019t like them, but unless they\u2019ve actually done something to warrant the dislike you do not let them know the avoiding is intentional. It\u2019s the difference between knowing yourself well enough to prevent conflicts from occurring versus being straight up mean.\nSecond, this is a study group. It\u2019s great that you enjoy being there socially as well, but at the end of the day the stated issue for meeting is to study. So unless your envy over the ten year old\u2019s abilities is so great that it is interfering with your learning, you don\u2019t really have a leg to stand on by complaining that her presence makes study group less fun/useful to you.

By all means drop out of the study group. That child doesn't need to be around you and you don't want to be around her. Are YTA? For your attitude about her, which comes through very clearly, yes. Frankly, I think you're doing her a favor by dropping out.", "NTA. This situation would have annoyed me, too.\n\nBut check the attitude.

On the other hand it\u2019s a study group and as a member of the class she has a right to be there, especially as she was invited in. It was unkind to be so obvious and hurt her feelings.  I don\u2019t agree with the assumption of some readers here that you\u2019re jealous but you clearly dislike her.

He walked with his face toward any wall or building he could.  Some of the older guys weren't so nice.  He was completely by himself.\n\nWhat happened by spring is that he was kind of adopted by some of the more awkward female freshman, ones who seemed to have maternal instincts.  That was his pack.

Where was the responsibility for care of the kid in the post? She was upset about having to be *around* the kid.", "OP literally explains that they just don't attend the group when the kid is around. It's not horrible to not want to spend your free time with someone else's unchaperoned kid.", ">Can't really pinpoint anything that changes just the overall attitude which is weird it's a study group not a hang out. I understand you can't bring up certain subjects around kids but it's an actual college study group not an episode of \"Community\", how much of a difference can there be. They just have to keep their language PG.\n\nI think we may have very different conceptions of what a study group is supposed to be.   I've not seen Community so I have no idea how college is presented on it.  However, I've participated in far more than my share of study groups.\n\nMy view, based on my experience, is that a study group is a specific kind of hang out -- a hang out with an overall purpose, i.e. mastering the material, but a hang out nonetheless.  It's not a classroom, nor does it function like a class.  It is discussion-centered and, essentially, autodidactic.  Digression is fine and relieves tension and stress.  Laughter is common and, perhaps, essential.  Raunchiness and morbid humor occur often.  The most critical study group in which I was a member was when I was preparing for the California Bar exam.  Our group consisted of friends who I knew well, respected and trusted.  We did everything in our group, including making up limericks about the subject matter, coming up with bizarre, extreme and frequently dark hypotheticals, using open and frank language (yes, that's a euphemism) and more than a little alcohol was consumed.  We were all roughly the same age and were comfortable with each other.  And we all passed the Bar easily and the first time.  I'm not saying all study groups should do what we did or the way we did it, but this was the dynamic that worked for us.\n\nA 10 year-old who can manage the material  and manage herself appropriately can handle a college class and should be welcome . . . in that class.  A study group is something else altogether.  It doesn't matter how bright the 10-year old is (and, for all I know, this specific 10 year-old may, indeed, be a genius).  What matters is whether her presence impacts the study group dynamic positively or negatively.  For the OP, the child's presence clearly impacted the group dynamic negatively.  That it might not have for the other members is irrelevant.  I do not criticize the OP, either for her response or her actions.  My only observation is that the way she expresses herself is typical of a college lowerclassman (again, based on my experience of having taught them).  Given her commitment to her education (don't forget, she is going to school AND working at the same time, a burden I didn't have as an undergraduate), I have no doubt that her forensic and writing skills will improve greatly as she progresses towards her degree.", "Just saw  your edit:\n\n>Edit:Also just wanted to comment on the baby genius thing you say it is a cultural reference. Where does the OP say it is cultural? \n\nThe OP didn't say it.  I said it.  \"Baby genius,\" particularly when used in quotes as they OP did, suggests to me the movie \"Baby Geniuses\" (released in 1999 -- I just looked it up), which was about . . . well . . . babies who were geniuses (I didn't see it, so I can't tell you more than that).  It also suggests to me a knock at a certain class of parents who believe, on little evidence, that their child is smarter, better looking, more charming, etc. than any of their coevals.  As another poster commented, there are some 10 year-olds who \"get\" math and can blast through the subject matter with ease.  That doesn't necessarily mean that they belong in college, instead of 4th grade with other kids their own age.", ">Edit 2: Just reread your thing about baby genius dude that movie was made in 1999 OP wasn't even born when it came out.  I doubt she is even aware of that movie.\n\nWhy do you assume that, just because the film was made a few years before she was born, she isn't aware of it?  It's a staple of the streaming services and, even though I haven't seen it, I know the premise.  Films reflect society and that film reflects a common mindset.", "They are in a library. They\u2019re not going to be having conversations that would be too grown up for a 10-year-old. They aren\u2019t going to be cussing, or talking about sex, because they are in a library. And just because she\u2019s part of the study group doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to go with them to grab a drink after, so why would that even matter.
