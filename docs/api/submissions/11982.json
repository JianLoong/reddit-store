You're 20 years old referring to a 10 yr old as a \"baby genius\" whose feelings you hurt. Do you understand how that makes you an AH?", "School-age kids taking a class at community college is common enough. Ten is unusual, but not unheard of - particularly for math, where kids that get it can bomb through the syllabus very quickly.\n\nIt's clear that most of the group is happy hanging out with the girl after math class. You don't want to spend time with her. You're not obliged to like everyone, and if you don't like this girl (or children in general), and so don't want to study with her, I suppose that's OK.\n\nGetting up and leaving when she asked to join the group was pretty obvious and pointed, though, and that makes you the AH here.\n\nYTA", "I agree with the NAH, though I think you are hurting yourself. You don't have to be part of a study group where you are not comfortable, but it sounds like this was a good group that was beneficial for you. \n\nI agree with other commenters that the nanny is the real problem. I work at a university that has had a few younger students - absolute geniuses who were much younger than standard college age (I'm not sure of the ages). Two siblings in particular graduated our university before they were 18. Their mother walked with them to classes and was there to help them out; it was awkward at times but it was probably the right move. They were geniuses but were also little kids (I have mixed emotions about having them go through school so early). I feel bad for this 10-year-old. It is probably incredibly difficult for her to navigate this situation.", "NTA\n\nYou don't like kids, and that's fine. You're telling your feelings about the kid to a neutral 3rd party that does not know the kid and will never interact with her, us. I don't mind the comments.\n\nAs long as you don't make those comments to the kid or those that know her, then I feel you're good.\n\nYou're handling the situation as best as you can. You remove yourself from the situation. You don't demand that a little kid goes somewhere else, so you're not inconvenienced.\n\nYou understand that while the situation sucks for you, the kid had limited options and has chosen to go to this group of adults that she trusts and you remove yourself to give her that. I respect that.", "NTA lol you don't have to be around a kid if you don't want to. You don't have to like how the vibe is different when she's there. You didn't say or do anything to her. You stopped going to something you enjoyed to fix your problem by yourself, without involving anyone else. \n\nIt's unfortunate they noticed. It's worse they *told her* what you were doing. But you're not obligated to be there if you don't want to be, and I don't think that makes you an asshole. Things are undeniably different when there's a kid present. Genius or not. That's why kids aren't allowed at certain parties. Or certain weddings. But this kid IS allowed to be at study group, so you removed yourself which is exactly what this sub would have told you to do if you had come and asked if you would be the asshole instead if of you already are. \n\nSo don't take all the ytas too hard lol", "Okay. Not everyone likes kids, that's just a fact of life. But you sound bitter like full on weirdly hateful.

That may have been inevitable but frankly - it\u2019s very odd that any of you were put in this situation. If the college is able to accommodate her educationally then they should be able to do *something* to provide adequate supervision and not have random students provide that labor (however easy it may be). If she was hurt or worse while in the study group, all of you would potentially be liable. I wouldn\u2019t want that.

If you don't like associating with someone or someone makes the vibes different then it's your right and none of their business to leave the situation. Your time is your most valuable resource, and if you don't feel like your gaining the value you want out of a study session it's 100%  your call to skip it.\n\nDon't let other people guilt you into wasting your time in a way that is genuinely against your desires. That's how you get bitter. Fuck em. Don't be a dick to the kid but don't waste your time dealing with them.", "I will say YTA for your attitude regarding the girl being there. Have you considered that this is a scary thing for the girl to be in a place full of adults? \n\nHowever.... I commend your way of going about minimizing the issue so as not to create a huge issue, but the girl is there for the same reason you are.... to learn. The socializing is an added bonus.\n\nLastly, the nanny that is supposed to pick up the girl is an AH though, as well as the parents for not handling it, because leaving a 10 year old on campus is not the greatest idea. The parents should figure that out and not have to rely on the kindness of other students. You are not childcare.", "I mean you're hurting yourself by not studying, but NAH I guess. You don't have to attend any study group if you're not comfortable with it.\n\nIt does sound like you look at this as socializing more than studying, so maybe it's best you don't attend if you can't maintain focus.", "YTA. You're acting like a mean girl in middle school, leaving the lunch table because \"she\" showed up. Your disdain for this girl is spewed a over this post. You are supposed to be an adult, but you are the one acting like a child here. This kid has done nothing to you - except exist. She ruins your vibe? Welcome to life. Time to learn how to get along and work with people you don't like.\n\nOn the flip side, the only person you are hurting by not going to study group is YOU. Study on your own, then, or stay in your lane. Leave the kid alone and try practicing some manners.", "INFO: How drastically different is the study group when she\u2019s there? Does everyone study as normal and she just hangs out, or is the entire study session just a giant babysitting experience for everyone.", "NAH because if you don't want to be around someone then that's your prerogative.\nHowever, you are very clearly jealous of a 10 year old.", "NTA", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to not join the study group on the days you now she\u2019ll be there (which is ridiculous) but to get up and leave when she had to spontaneously join the group was just rude.

NTA for the way YTA.\n\nYTA for skipping a group hang because \u201cbaby genius\u201d is there. This is a kid who doesn\u2019t fit in with kids her age or the adults she goes to school with. She found a kind study group, and it sucks that you\u2019re so pissed off about it. You could just sit on the opposite end of the table as her. \n\nBut you avoided her in a way that kept your issue to yourself, and you\u2019re not obligated to attend events if you don\u2019t want to. But you should just reevaluate your problem with this girl.", "NAH\n\nIf you're not keen on hanging out with the kid, I don't see anything wrong with you choosing to do something else. You haven't actively tried to exclude her from the group, or complained to your friends; you've identified a situation you're not comfortable with and separated yourself from it rather than putting the onus for dealing with it on everyone else in the group. That sounds fairly mature to me. \n\nYou may have hurt the kid's feelings, but she's 10 so she's not emotionally prepared to process why you're not coming around. It would not make sense to me that a strangers lack of maturity should dictate where you set your boundaries. \n\nAs to your friends and your mom, they obviously don't agree with you stepping away, and think your behavior is unnecessarily exclusionary and harmful. On this point I honestly sort of agree. Your discomfort is a you issue, and stepping away from a work/social group because you can't handle being around a 10 year old is in my mind a little silly. \n\nHowever, that's just my opinion, and perhaps the opinion of your friends and family. While I think there's nothing wrong with them having and expressing those views, there's equally nothing wrong with you having your own and having boundaries based on your own comfort rather than the comfort of others.", "INFO - how many people in this study group? If its more than a few, you could still participate without having to interact with her very much.", "YTA for the way you use put downs to refer to her and generally think of her in some weird jealous way.  Some people don\u2019t like kids though, so if you were like I don\u2019t like the vibe when kids are around so I found something else to do, that would be fair.  Just don\u2019t be an AH about it like you were in your post.", "YTA and sound jealous af of a kid who\u2019s done nothing to you", "YTA - why is it such a problem she\u2019s there? Are you intimidated that someone so young is that smart?

You write so condescendingly about this girl who sounds like she\u2019s just trying to make friends and fit in. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s awkward for her too. I\u2019d expect an adult to treat a child with respect and not be annoyed by their mere existence. If she\u2019s smart enough for college level math and science then she\u2019s smart enough to be able to tell you don\u2019t like her. You need to get over yourself.

It's fine for you to not want to be around kids.", "YTA. You sound like a jerk. You\u2019re twice her age - why do you feel the need to include so many put downs about her in your post? Are you that insecure that a 10 year old is in the same class as you? You\u2019re not an AH for not wanting to hang out with her I guess, but you are a pathetic AH for how you\u2019re talking about a 10 year old in this post.", "YTA. Has this kid ever done anything to inconvenience you, other than being smart?", "You are being rude and making up names for a kid. Like grow up. YTA and I hope your study group keeps the kid. Seems like they traded up.", "NTA Why does it matter to them? You didn\u2019t even tell them she was the problem. You said you had to work. Whoever told everyone was out of line. They\u2019re the one who hurt her feelings.", "NAH. I don't understand the other responses because, in general, this forum sticks by the \"allow people to decide who they want to hang out with\" principle. You don't want to hang out with a kid. So don't. Just realize that means you won't be seeing as much of the other people in your class, so your social life could suffer for it.", "As an adult who was that kid, I have mixed feelings.\n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to always have study group involve a 10yo, but if she\u2019s in the class, it\u2019s a reasonable place for her to be. To leave every single time, but still expect to be in the group whenever it\u2019s convenient is\u2026 convenient. In the unkind way.\n\nTake the group as it is, or leave it. But the over attitude here is pretty unflattering to you.", "NTA. Ya you\u2019re tone is a little rude here but as long as you aren\u2019t saying it directly to the kid, you\u2019re good. Biggest asshole here is the parents. Poor kid, probably doesn\u2019t get a childhood\u2026 or actual FRIENDS her age.", "I have a BA, an MFA, a JD, and I completed my doctoral coursework (though I never wrote my dissertation).  I've also taught at the university level.  I think I have, at least, an informed opinion about studying and study groups. :)\n\nI am, frankly, surprised at the hostility shown to the OP.  The environment for learning is as important as the quality of instruction, and that includes study groups.  A relaxed, social study group is, for many people (including myself), an important learning tool.  A 10-year old may have the intellectual ability to master the material but, when it comes to a study group, may not have sufficient emotional or social maturity to participate constructively.  This has nothing to do with feeling \"threatened\" as some posters have claimed.  If, as the OP writes, the dynamic of the study group is changed to the point where it no longer provides an appropriate environment FOR THE OP, there is absolutely nothing wrong with her absenting herself from it.  This has nothing to do with compassion, or the lack of it.  Her \"job\" as a student is to learn the material.  It is not her responsibility to assist a young child at her own educational expense.  She did not insult the child, and either simply didn't attend when she knew the child was there, or left when she discovered the child was present.\n\nIn NYC in junior high, we had a program called \"SP\" for \"Special Placement.\"  It allowed children to skip 8th grade, going directly from 7th to 9th grade.  I was in this program.  Since the consequence of being in SP meant graduating high school a year earlier than normal, and being one year younger than college classmates in the same year, the parents of the SP kids were consulted as to whether their kids possessed sufficient emotional and social maturity, and this addressed only a ONE YEAR age difference.  It is up to the parents of the child in the OP's study group to make that determination for their daughter; it is not the OP's obligation to compensate for what may have been a poor decision on the part of the child's parents.\n\nI fully understand the OP's frustration.  In my opinion, she is definitely NTA.  If anyone is an AH, it is the parents of the young girl for either misjudging their daughter's maturity, or leaving her ill-prepared to participate with other college students.", "I mean, you made it really obvious when you started packing up to leave as soon as she got there... I'm going to go with yes. It's fine to not really want to hang out with kids but it's not like you're stuck talking to only her in a group that big. Kind of sounds like you have an issue with her advanced learning, the way you describe her.   \nSo yeah, YTA.", "The ten year old is in ONE study group that you were in. One child in a sea of \"adults\". It doesn't sound like anyone else is bothered but you. I can only imagine how difficult it is for her in her social situation. Why can't you be mature and show some  compassion for her for a little while in a group setting? For one class that is only for a term or semester. YTA", "NTA- kids and young adults have different mindsets and maturity. Even if they are privileged enough to study at a higher level, most kids and adults don\u2019t have many things in common. It\u2019s weird for a child to be part of an adult study group really.", "YTA Another way to describe the situation is that you abandoned a study group because there was too much studying. The 10 year old eliminates the social aspects of the group. That makes sense.  It\u2019s fine if you just want to socialize. But a study group isn\u2019t the appropriate place to do that. Maybe the casual atmosphere is misleading but the intent of the group is still educational.", "YTA - Awww somebodies little feelings got hurt by the presence of the baby genius didn't they!! Hugely immature dudette....do better", "YTA.\n\nBut you\u2019re the only one missing out, so really you\u2019re an asshole to yourself.\n\nYour privilege.", "YTA, You don\u2019t have to like kids but that doesn\u2019t mean you can be mean to them, she didn\u2019t even do anything to you.

I took it as examples for why they have no social compatibility. I work with kids, and the reality is that you can't talk about things on the same level with children as you can an adult.

Being ten in middle school is not uncommon", "That doesn't really change much for me, tbh, it's still unfortunate but like. You don't have to like hanging around her. You just don't.\n\nI don't like one the girls in my class. She's rude as hell, she refuses to do any work, and when you explain what she's doing wrong she just says she wasn't doing it.

Most of the kids were also socially awkward, so it helped a little to be surrounded by similar peers but she still struggled with friends outside of the classroom. She was fortunate to have a socially savvy brother who gave her tips and advice on how to interact with peers and she was able to find a small group of like-minded friends who she stayed close with throughout high school. She is now a college student at a pretty nerdy school and seems to be doing well socially, but it took a lot of effort to get to this point.\n\nAnd my kid wasn't even a \"baby genius\" taking college courses at age 10.

Or maybe that they're preoccupied with the novelty of it, thus not seeing the legitimate issues at hand. I've worked in higher ed and there has even been debate over letting high schoolers dual-enroll because some classes cover content that is not minor-friendly, or it's a gray area and opens profs/other students up for trouble.\n\nAlso, there's all this uproar over OP's tone and not much about the fact that a child is being left unattended with random college students/their caretaker is habitually late and apparently not always present. It sounds like others in class/on campus are put in an awkward situation simply due to this child's presence in that regard. Like there are too many instances where no one is there to make sure the kid isn't left alone, so the other young adults around have to take responsibility for both her safety and her emotional well-being by not making her feel excluded.", "I understand, perhaps we're getting that sense since OP does seem frustrated to some degree that their study plans keep getting \"interrupted\" by the kid's presence?

Its okay not to like being around kids. That definitely doesnt make it okay to be mean to them!", "Very true, from what I see OP is owning the problem as entirely their issue by leaving rather than complaining or being offputting for an extended time.
