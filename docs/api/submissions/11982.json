I'm not a kid person. Being in the same class as one is weird enough but I'm not going to get coffee (or in her case, a juice box) and hang out with one. \n\nI went to study group when she was there once and it was just weird. The whole mood is different. She joins the group on Mondays and Wednesdays so I said that I have to work early on those days and do homework at home. Then on Fridays I joined the group and it's like the baby genius doesn't exist. \n\nThen on Friday she asked if she could join us. Her nanny called in sick so she had to wait on campus until her mom could pick her up. The group said yes so I started to leave. Someone asked where I was going so I said I got called in to work early. Well, that made them figure it out and I got texts from half the group asking if I'm seriously skipping the group because there's a kid there and all calling me immature and saying I hurt baby genius's feelings by not wanting to go to group when she's there. \n\nI told my mom about it and she agrees that it's stupid and immature to miss study group just because there's a kid there.

You're 20 years old referring to a 10 yr old as a \"baby genius\" whose feelings you hurt. Do you understand how that makes you an AH?", "School-age kids taking a class at community college is common enough. Ten is unusual, but not unheard of - particularly for math, where kids that get it can bomb through the syllabus very quickly.\n\nIt's clear that most of the group is happy hanging out with the girl after math class. You don't want to spend time with her. You're not obliged to like everyone, and if you don't like this girl (or children in general), and so don't want to study with her, I suppose that's OK.\n\nGetting up and leaving when she asked to join the group was pretty obvious and pointed, though, and that makes you the AH here.\n\nYTA", "I agree with the NAH, though I think you are hurting yourself. You don't have to be part of a study group where you are not comfortable, but it sounds like this was a good group that was beneficial for you. \n\nI agree with other commenters that the nanny is the real problem. I work at a university that has had a few younger students - absolute geniuses who were much younger than standard college age (I'm not sure of the ages). Two siblings in particular graduated our university before they were 18. Their mother walked with them to classes and was there to help them out; it was awkward at times but it was probably the right move. They were geniuses but were also little kids (I have mixed emotions about having them go through school so early). I feel bad for this 10-year-old. It is probably incredibly difficult for her to navigate this situation.", "NTA\n\nYou don't like kids, and that's fine. You're telling your feelings about the kid to a neutral 3rd party that does not know the kid and will never interact with her, us. I don't mind the comments.\n\nAs long as you don't make those comments to the kid or those that know her, then I feel you're good.\n\nYou're handling the situation as best as you can. You remove yourself from the situation. You don't demand that a little kid goes somewhere else, so you're not inconvenienced.\n\nYou understand that while the situation sucks for you, the kid had limited options and has chosen to go to this group of adults that she trusts and you remove yourself to give her that. I respect that.", "NTA lol you don't have to be around a kid if you don't want to. You don't have to like how the vibe is different when she's there. You didn't say or do anything to her. You stopped going to something you enjoyed to fix your problem by yourself, without involving anyone else. \n\nIt's unfortunate they noticed. It's worse they *told her* what you were doing. But you're not obligated to be there if you don't want to be, and I don't think that makes you an asshole. Things are undeniably different when there's a kid present. Genius or not. That's why kids aren't allowed at certain parties. Or certain weddings. But this kid IS allowed to be at study group, so you removed yourself which is exactly what this sub would have told you to do if you had come and asked if you would be the asshole instead if of you already are. \n\nSo don't take all the ytas too hard lol", "Okay. Not everyone likes kids, that's just a fact of life. But you sound bitter like full on weirdly hateful.

That may have been inevitable but frankly - it\u2019s very odd that any of you were put in this situation. If the college is able to accommodate her educationally then they should be able to do *something* to provide adequate supervision and not have random students provide that labor (however easy it may be). If she was hurt or worse while in the study group, all of you would potentially be liable. I wouldn\u2019t want that.

If you don't like associating with someone or someone makes the vibes different then it's your right and none of their business to leave the situation. Your time is your most valuable resource, and if you don't feel like your gaining the value you want out of a study session it's 100%  your call to skip it.\n\nDon't let other people guilt you into wasting your time in a way that is genuinely against your desires. That's how you get bitter. Fuck em. Don't be a dick to the kid but don't waste your time dealing with them.", "I will say YTA for your attitude regarding the girl being there. Have you considered that this is a scary thing for the girl to be in a place full of adults? \n\nHowever.... I commend your way of going about minimizing the issue so as not to create a huge issue, but the girl is there for the same reason you are.... to learn. The socializing is an added bonus.\n\nLastly, the nanny that is supposed to pick up the girl is an AH though, as well as the parents for not handling it, because leaving a 10 year old on campus is not the greatest idea. The parents should figure that out and not have to rely on the kindness of other students. You are not childcare.", "I mean you're hurting yourself by not studying, but NAH I guess. You don't have to attend any study group if you're not comfortable with it.\n\nIt does sound like you look at this as socializing more than studying, so maybe it's best you don't attend if you can't maintain focus.", "YTA. You're acting like a mean girl in middle school, leaving the lunch table because \"she\" showed up. Your disdain for this girl is spewed a over this post. You are supposed to be an adult, but you are the one acting like a child here. This kid has done nothing to you - except exist. She ruins your vibe? Welcome to life. Time to learn how to get along and work with people you don't like.\n\nOn the flip side, the only person you are hurting by not going to study group is YOU. Study on your own, then, or stay in your lane. Leave the kid alone and try practicing some manners.", "INFO: How drastically different is the study group when she\u2019s there? Does everyone study as normal and she just hangs out, or is the entire study session just a giant babysitting experience for everyone.", "NAH because if you don't want to be around someone then that's your prerogative.\nHowever, you are very clearly jealous of a 10 year old.", "NTA", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to not join the study group on the days you now she\u2019ll be there (which is ridiculous) but to get up and leave when she had to spontaneously join the group was just rude.

NTA for the way YTA.\n\nYTA for skipping a group hang because \u201cbaby genius\u201d is there. This is a kid who doesn\u2019t fit in with kids her age or the adults she goes to school with. She found a kind study group, and it sucks that you\u2019re so pissed off about it. You could just sit on the opposite end of the table as her. \n\nBut you avoided her in a way that kept your issue to yourself, and you\u2019re not obligated to attend events if you don\u2019t want to. But you should just reevaluate your problem with this girl.", "NAH\n\nIf you're not keen on hanging out with the kid, I don't see anything wrong with you choosing to do something else. You haven't actively tried to exclude her from the group, or complained to your friends; you've identified a situation you're not comfortable with and separated yourself from it rather than putting the onus for dealing with it on everyone else in the group. That sounds fairly mature to me. \n\nYou may have hurt the kid's feelings, but she's 10 so she's not emotionally prepared to process why you're not coming around. It would not make sense to me that a strangers lack of maturity should dictate where you set your boundaries. \n\nAs to your friends and your mom, they obviously don't agree with you stepping away, and think your behavior is unnecessarily exclusionary and harmful. On this point I honestly sort of agree. Your discomfort is a you issue, and stepping away from a work/social group because you can't handle being around a 10 year old is in my mind a little silly. \n\nHowever, that's just my opinion, and perhaps the opinion of your friends and family. While I think there's nothing wrong with them having and expressing those views, there's equally nothing wrong with you having your own and having boundaries based on your own comfort rather than the comfort of others.", "INFO - how many people in this study group? If its more than a few, you could still participate without having to interact with her very much.", "YTA for the way you use put downs to refer to her and generally think of her in some weird jealous way.  Some people don\u2019t like kids though, so if you were like I don\u2019t like the vibe when kids are around so I found something else to do, that would be fair.  Just don\u2019t be an AH about it like you were in your post.", "YTA and sound jealous af of a kid who\u2019s done nothing to you", "YTA - why is it such a problem she\u2019s there? Are you intimidated that someone so young is that smart? The rest of the group doesn\u2019t mind she\u2019s there so it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s doing any harm, I get not liking kids but honestly that\u2019s just so extra to skip every time bc you don\u2019t wanna be around \u201cbaby genius\u201d", "YTA. You write so condescendingly about this girl who sounds like she\u2019s just trying to make friends and fit in. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s awkward for her too. I\u2019d expect an adult to treat a child with respect and not be annoyed by their mere existence. If she\u2019s smart enough for college level math and science then she\u2019s smart enough to be able to tell you don\u2019t like her. You need to get over yourself.

It's fine for you to not want to be around kids.", "YTA. You sound like a jerk. You\u2019re twice her age - why do you feel the need to include so many put downs about her in your post? Are you that insecure that a 10 year old is in the same class as you? You\u2019re not an AH for not wanting to hang out with her I guess, but you are a pathetic AH for how you\u2019re talking about a 10 year old in this post.", "YTA. Has this kid ever done anything to inconvenience you, other than being smart?", "You are being rude and making up names for a kid. Like grow up. YTA and I hope your study group keeps the kid. Seems like they traded up.", "NTA Why does it matter to them? You didn\u2019t even tell them she was the problem. You said you had to work. Whoever told everyone was out of line. They\u2019re the one who hurt her feelings.", "NAH. I don't understand the other responses because, in general, this forum sticks by the \"allow people to decide who they want to hang out with\" principle. You don't want to hang out with a kid. So don't. Just realize that means you won't be seeing as much of the other people in your class, so your social life could suffer for it.", "As an adult who was that kid, I have mixed feelings.\n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to always have study group involve a 10yo, but if she\u2019s in the class, it\u2019s a reasonable place for her to be. To leave every single time, but still expect to be in the group whenever it\u2019s convenient is\u2026 convenient. In the unkind way.\n\nTake the group as it is, or leave it. But the over attitude here is pretty unflattering to you.", "NTA. Ya you\u2019re tone is a little rude here but as long as you aren\u2019t saying it directly to the kid, you\u2019re good. Biggest asshole here is the parents. Poor kid, probably doesn\u2019t get a childhood\u2026 or actual FRIENDS her age.", "I have a BA, an MFA, a JD, and I completed my doctoral coursework (though I never wrote my dissertation).  I've also taught at the university level.  I think I have, at least, an informed opinion about studying and study groups. :)\n\nI am, frankly, surprised at the hostility shown to the OP.  The environment for learning is as important as the quality of instruction, and that includes study groups.  A relaxed, social study group is, for many people (including myself) an important learning tool.  A 10-year old may have the intellectual ability to master the material but, when it comes to a study group, may not have sufficient emotional or social maturity to participate constructively.  This has nothing to do with feeling \"threatened\" as some posters have claimed.  If, as the OP writes, the dynamic of the study group is changed to the point where it no longer provides an appropriate environment FOR THE OP, there is absolutely nothing wrong with her absenting herself from it.  This has nothing to do with compassion, or the lack of it.  Her \"job\" as a student is to learn the material.  It is not her responsibility to assist a young child at her own educational expense.  She did not insult the child, and either simply didn't attend when she knew the child was there, or left when she discovered the child was present.\n\nIn NYC in junior high, we had a program called \"SP\" for \"Special Placement.\"  It allowed children to skip 8th grade, going directly from 7th to 9th grade.  I was in this program.  Since the consequence of being in SP meant graduating high school a year early than normal, and being one year younger than college classmates in the same year, the parents of the SP kids were consulted as to whether their kids sufficient emotional and social maturity, and this addressed only a ONE YEAR age difference.  It is up to the parents of the child in the OP's study group to make that determination for their daughter; it is not the OP's obligation to compensate for what may have been a poor decision on the part of the child's parents.  \n\n\nI fully understand the OP's frustration.  In my opinion, she is definitely NTA.  If anyone is an AH, it is the parents of the young girl for either misjudging their daughter's maturity, or leaving her ill-prepared to participate with other college students.", "I mean, you made it really obvious when you started packing up to leave as soon as she got there... I'm going to go with yes. It's fine to not really want to hang out with kids but it's not like you're stuck talking to only her in a group that big. Kind of sounds like you have an issue with her advanced learning, the way you describe her.   \nSo yeah, YTA.", "The ten year old is in ONE study group that you were in. One child in a sea of \"adults\". It doesn't sound like anyone else is bothered but you. I can only imagine how difficult it is for her in her social situation. Why can't you be mature and show some  compassion for her for a little while in a group setting? For one class that is only for a term or semester. YTA", "NTA- kids and young adults have different mindsets and maturity. Even if they are privileged enough to study at a higher level, most kids and adults don\u2019t have many things in common. It\u2019s weird for a child to be part of an adult study group really.", "YTA Another way to describe the situation is that you abandoned a study group because there was too much studying. The 10 year old eliminates the social aspects of the group. That makes sense.  It\u2019s fine if you just want to socialize. But a study group isn\u2019t the appropriate place to do that. Maybe the casual atmosphere is misleading but the intent of the group is still educational.", "YTA - Awww somebodies little feelings got hurt by the presence of the baby genius didn't they!! Hugely immature dudette....do better", "YTA.\n\nBut you\u2019re the only one missing out, so really you\u2019re an asshole to yourself.\n\nYour privilege.", "YTA, You don\u2019t have to like kids but that doesn\u2019t mean you can be mean to them, she didn\u2019t even do anything to you.

And I\u2019m glad she\u2019s got a princess backpack. She\u2019s allowed to still be a kid and enjoy kid things. \nLet go of whatever resentment you\u2019re feeling though. It\u2019s probably doing you more harm than anyone else. She sounds pretty chill.", "OP, I feel like that little girl is 10x more mature than you. You don\u2019t have to like kids, but you don\u2019t get to talk about them like that. I\u2019m childfree. But kids are still human and they deserve respect. \u201cBaby genius\u201d? Really? Grow up.\n\nYTA.", "Wow I feel sorry for you\n\nYta", "Awwww is someone jealous the baby genius is smarter than her? I'm 40 and have a princess cup and princess bag. Guess what my princess bag also has more toys for kids than things for the big girl adults such as yourself \ud83e\udd23. Get over yourself. Nobody asked you to babysit she is joining your study group because she is at the same educational level as you. Also I'd rather have a juice box than coffee so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou're not just averse to kids. You're jealous of this girl. Maybe you should ask yourself why. \n\nWhat's wrong with a princess backpack? Nothing at all. You're just being hateful.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to like kids but you should be kind to them just like every other human. For the record, she might have toys but you\u2019re the one acting like a child here.", "So, she\u2019s mature enough to be left without an escort on a college campus but too young for you to sit with for an hour? It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s that immature. It sounds like her maturity isn\u2019t that far off the maturity of you and your classmates. \n\nAlso, this is the opportunity to get to know a truly extraordinary person but you can\u2019t get past the stupid ass rules you have for ppl who are cool enough to be graced with your presence. Like, how many times in your life will you get the chance to meet a true genius? Her IQ is higher than yours by a significant amount- as evidenced by the fact that you\u2019re so small minded. You should be spending a lot of time with her to see what you can learn. \n\nSometimes gifted kids like her crash and burn shortly after high school. Sometimes they\u2019re a CEO by 22. Be careful how you treat her- the world is small. She could be in charge of you in just a few short years. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t use ppl, ever, but it\u2019s smart to remember that you never know when someone might be in a position to help you out. It\u2019s called networking and it\u2019s something you should practice getting good at. \n\nI\u2019m so thankful I raised my kids to be so much better than this. It\u2019s not hard to be nice to her. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asked to change a diaper. \n\nYTA- just talk to the short human", "YTA. you're 20 years old but treating this child as a parasite. you have the right to not/not WANT to attend, but can you already imagine the stress and uneasiness she already feels? i get it, its odd, but grow up. im sure its just as uncomfortable for her.\n\nyou think its easy for a 10 year old to be surrounded by people a decade older than her? im sure she already naturally feels like an outcast or really nervous just by the environment.\n\nyou're being unreasonably vile to her presence, this isn't the end of the wolrd, so stop treating her like she is. yes, this is immature.", "It started rubbing me the wrong way when OP kept calling her \"baby genius\". Starts to sound a bit jealous or resentful after a while...", "I completely agree with you. Also, I am sure people in the study group are trying to make her feel welcomed because I am sure others already ostracize her. It can't be easy being an environment without her peers.", "Where did OP call her names?", "To be fair, I don't know that I'd want to hang out with a 10 year old either if I'm in college.", "Why, though? Isn't part of learning learning that not everyone is going to want to play with you? That's a totally age appropriate lesson for the kid and OP didn't do or say anything to her directly. Theu kept it to themselves, and forewent something enjoyed to fix their own problem.", "There's anywhere between 6-12 people, depending on the day and if we have a test coming up.", "Pretty sure the college doesn't have a separate study group for 10 year olds. Adult study group is all they have.", "I doubt a community college daycare is for a 10 year old. She probably \u201ccan\u2019t check herself in\u201d because she\u2019s not supposed to be there.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong, but when I hear \u201cdaycare\u201d I\u2019m not usually thinking 5th graders\u2026", "OP didn't pick on them at all. NTA. They have every right not to want to spend time around a 10 year old girl. I personally love kids, I worked as a full time nanny for 5 or 6 years, have a real soft spot. But I also totally understand not wanting to be around them sometimes, for whatever reason, they don't need to give a reason. Whether it's a child or not, they can chose not to be around whoever they please. It's doesnt make them an asshole unless they're an asshole about it! They didn't say anything to anyone, they figured it out themselves, and if 10yo finds out what they're doing and become offended, the only person who's fault it would be, would be whoever told her. She doesn't need to know that OP is avoiding her. It doesnt even affect her in anyway. As long as no one goes out of their way to make her feel shitty about it. It's OKAY to not like people!!! Just keep it to yourself. And OP did.", "I'm not sure why OP thinks trying to dunk on ten year olds makes them look cool. It doesn't.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. \n\nUnfortunately some people are threatened by anything and anyone. \n\n\nInsecurity at it\u2019s finest.", "She called her \"baby genius\" twice. Am I supposed to think that is a term of endearment?", "Yeah but she\u2019s not there to hang. She\u2019s there to learn and study. It\u2019s like the same thing when you see senior citizens in your college classes.", "There\u2019s a difference between hanging out with a group of friends and a study group. It was classmates getting together to study. The vibe is much different. She\u2019s not your average 10 year old. She\u2019s a genius. Who wouldn\u2019t want a genius on their study group, no matter how old they are?", "\u2026that was exactly my point?\n\nOP was NTA in their behavior because they did their best to not make it known why they were skipping. They\u2019re just TA in how much they dislike this girl based on her lunchbox & backpack contents, and give no examples of how her actual behavior bothers them.", "Yeah but this child also didn\u2019t seek out a study group. She joined because her nanny was always late. This group is acting as her babysitters. I think OP was really rude to get up and leave in this instance, but she\u2019s NTA for choosing not to be there on the regular days when the study-social group gets turned into a study-babysitter\u2019s club.", "Daycare is presumably for children of students and teachers.  She could sit and read a book.", "Lots of kids get picked up from day cares after school or even dropped off by them because their parents work. The 2 I worked at we got all the grade school kids at 330ish everyday until 6ish when we closed.During school breaks the kids came there lol.", "It's just a description...", "I get that.  At the same time, OP says its also kind of like a social thing. \n\nIn undergrad and grad school I definitely had the \"serious\" study groups, where it was all business.  And the \"social\" study groups where we studied, but also would talk and have fun in more of a social thing.", "And that's exactly my point. They don't actually have to have a reason. They don't want to be around the kid. The end. It doesn't need to be justified and it doesn't make them an asshole. But actually OP did give a reason. \n\nThings are undeniably different when a kid is around, even for a study group. And they don't like it. And that's ok. That's why kids cant go to certain places or do certain things. But this girl is totally allowed and should be encouraged to join the group of they'll have her. \n\nBut OP isn't an asshole for no longer enjoying the group now that things have changed.", "You find yourself describing non-babies as babies for accuracy, do you?", "Calling a 10 year old a baby is not a description. The nickname is condescending", "Genius is a a description, baby genius is name calling and not a description unless she was 1.  She is not 1, she is 10.  Young genius, pre-teen genius or genius  would be descriptive names."]}
