Something felt very off about it and I was lost since I knew nothing about taxes. She also had an existing debt of 3.5k USD to me.

They also told me that I am ungrateful for all the things they did to raise me. My grandmother started crying saying how she got hurt when I told her she\u2019s a liar and that I no longer trust her, and asked me if I would care if she died.
