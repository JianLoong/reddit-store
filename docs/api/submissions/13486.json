They don't show you any interest or respect. Making sure they could come to the exhibition feels like a very simple request that they should be happy to honor. Of course you were gonna lose your cool eventually.", "NTA. You flipped out very understandably, and your parents sound pretty damaging if they\u2019re response was to say now they wanna come even less. They are completely in the wrong but it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re open to changing or understanding how you feel. But I hope you don\u2019t internalize that; it\u2019s not bc of you, it\u2019s their problem. And their loss. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry OP bc that\u2019s an awful feeling, my mom started having no interest in me when I became a teenager, then on-and-off in adult life. I\u2019ve ended up going NC. It\u2019s hard to even type this bc my response is coming off so cut-and-dry, and I know it\u2019s really a very heavy feeling. I\u2019m just a DM away if you ever wanna vent, and also please update this post with a picture of your artwork! I\u2019d love to see it and would come to the opening if I could!", "100% NTA here, I would personally cut them off for a while if at all possible and not invite them to anything moving forward and not talk to them and when they call just say I\u2019m busy like you always seem to be when I need you.  Maybe they will get the hint then and try harder to be there for you as much as your siblings.", "NTA I can\u2019t imagine why any parent would do that. My parents were completely disinterested & disengaged but still showed up for major events.", "NTA. Maybe you could have managed the problem without flipping out. But your emotions are very well justified. You also let your parents know about your feelings albeit in a wrong way by flipping out and yelling but I personally suggest you talk to them again in a calm atmosphere and sort out any misunderstandings.\n\nBut this a very real problem that many siblings face. Parents always forget a basic rule of parenting, that is, treating their children equally. Even our democracy preaches equality. It's also the same for us children too. I, personally won't say that I love one parent more than the other either through words or actions. The same I also expect from my parents.", "NTA. It sounds to me like you got angry and yelled at them because this has been building up over a long time. This dinner date incident, standing alone, would be hurtful but maybe not as big of a deal. But it sounds like there's been a pattern of them routinely letting you down. I'm sorry, OP. You deserve better.", "NTA - They have a pattern of behavior and choices and you finally had enough and called them out on it. I would suggest No Contact if possible, because they already have shown who they are.", "NTA, its not just this event you have flipped out on, it's years and hundred of missed moments that have made you feel less then other family members. Your parent suck and suck hard, they don't deserve your emotion, time or effort, if they can't be bothered to be parents go NC and don't be their child and focus on you! very sorry that they made you feel like this. And they deserve all the the things you tell them.", "NTA. Your parents appear to be major assholes. Now let's hear their side to see if that's true.", "NTA you had every right to be hurt. And i will never understand how someone could think he would be the AH for yelling. In such emotional situations it's completly normal to yell, scream and cry. And if someone pushes you so far like your parents did it's also natural to flip out. \nI'm sorry you deserve better than that", "NTA for being angry with your parents, but are just a little bit of an AH for going completely off the deep end, although that's understandable if you've been holding it in for a while.\n\nYour parents are AHs.", "NTA.  You hit your boiling over point.  Your parents totally shit on you with this museum thing.  They can go to dinner any day I bet.  Even if they can't, friends are from way out of town or something, they could still go to your opening with those friends to celebrate something their daughter put so much time and energy into and is proud of.\n\nI'm sorry they don't respect you.  Do try and keep your temper in the future though.", "NTA .. they deliberatly chose to book dinner.. women are allowed too be angry and show anger which you did.", "NTA. \n\nYou should learn to control your anger better (in general) but in this situation imma say just go for it.\n\nGladly tell them to fuck off.", "NTA.  You have every right to be angry, and while blowing up at them probably solved nothing, at least you finally got all of that hurt out in the open.  It\u2019s in the universe now, they can\u2019t pretend you never told them how you felt.  I\u2019m so sorry, it really sucks being the kid that your parents make no effort for.  My advice is lower your expectations of them, and stop inviting them to things and sharing your achievements with them, so that you will stop being disappointed in their disinterest.", "NTA and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. They sound wildly disengaged and you did your part to tell them multiplr times ahead of time. No caring parent should constantly push off their child like that", "NTA but stop inviting them. They showed they don't care.", "NTA You\u2019ve remained calm and dealt with your parents ignoring your accomplishments for 22 years. This was something that was so incredibly important to you that you reminded them every 2 days of how important it was and they still can\u2019t show up for you. I\u2019m so sorry. Tell them they aren\u2019t invited anymore and won\u2019t ever be invited to anything in your life ever again, so long as it is safe for you to say that to them. If you still rely on them for anything, just go to your opening and enjoy your time with your true family, the one you chose, your friends who love you and support you. And when other life milestones come up, just don\u2019t invite your parents. Let them wonder why they are invited to the wedding if you get married or why they will never meet their grandchildren if you have kids. \n\nCongratulations on the opening and I hope you have a wonderful evening!", "NTA sounds like this has been brewing for a while. Your parents suck", "NTA.\n\nIt's good that you flipped out; they should know how they made you feel.\n\nI'm sorry, but they just don't care. Going forward, just know that and your hopes won;t be dashed.\n\nI'd recommend going LC on them. Don't call or visit. When they call, tell them you're in the middle of something and you'll call back. Then don't. Some posters will be Pollyannas and tell you not to react, but, believe me, it feels very good.", "Flipping out is never a good look of you want to not be an asshole. Feeling like the forgotten middle child does not give you the right to yell at people. \n\nESH. You for yelling, and your parents for scheduling a conflicting event and not trying to schedule around it.", "ESH", "[deleted]", "ESH.  You're an adult.  I understand that your feelings are hurt (and absolutely reasonable for you to feel that way).  But you can handle this without yelling or cursing.  The truth is, you might actually make more impact on them by calmly saying, \"this is very important to me.  I've asked you to attend.  I feel completely rejected and ignored that you cannot make time to celebrate this milestone with me.\"  \n\n\nAnd, of course, they absolutely can cancel on the restaurant.  There might be a fee, but there are no \"restaurant police\" that will show up at your house to frog march them down to dinner.  They could (and I'm just blue-skying here) \\*invite their friends to your exhibition\\*.  They could keep their social commitment to the friends \\*and\\* support you in your art.  \n\n\nYou have every right to be hurt and upset.  It sounds like your parents may be behaving in a very narcissistic way.  If so, it is unlikely that they will ever change or be able to show you the kind of attention that you're craving.  If you're not already discussing this with a therapist, it might be valuable.  \n\n\nYour parents have been hurting you and disappointing you for a long time.  My guess is that they will continue to do so.  You can't control them.  You can only control how you respond to them, and what you expect of them.", "You were out of line getting nasty with your parents but this is no small mistake and you are completely justified for being upset just not in the way you showed it.\n\nHowever, when they say they want to come even less because of the way you acted, is wrong. \n\nThey knew how important it was to you because you made that abundantly clear and they chose to make inconsequential plans instead? Gross.\n\nYou have a right to be upset, going nuclear wasn't cool though.", "Bigtime TAH here. You never yell at your parents. You shoud treat them with the respect they deserve. Being upset id fine. Nothing wrong with being disapointed... but not yelling. And I guess all your firends are your age and also lack respect to their parents.\nSit down with your parents and explain. Maybe they will still not understand but youhave tried to educate them in a respectful manner. \nIf you think life is unfair now, just you wait.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only thing you can do is give them less attention, start putting them way down on your list of priorities. If there is a kindly aunt, uncle, cousin, grandma, older kindly neighbour, family friend, teacher etc then cultivate a relationship with them instead and make a substitute foster parent. This is what I did with my parents, I replaced them at age 19, with normal, kindly, honest people and invited them to my events instead.
