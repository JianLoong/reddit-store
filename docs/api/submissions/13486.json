They don't show you any interest or respect. Making sure they could come to the exhibition feels like a very simple request that they should be happy to honor. Of course you were gonna lose your cool eventually.", "NTA. You flipped out very understandably, and your parents sound pretty damaging if they\u2019re response was to say now they wanna come even less. They are completely in the wrong but it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re open to changing or understanding how you feel. But I hope you don\u2019t internalize that; it\u2019s not bc of you, it\u2019s their problem. And their loss. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry OP bc that\u2019s an awful feeling, my mom started having no interest in me when I became a teenager, then on-and-off in adult life. I\u2019ve ended up going NC. It\u2019s hard to even type this bc my response is coming off so cut-and-dry, and I know it\u2019s really a very heavy feeling. I\u2019m just a DM away if you ever wanna vent, and also please update this post with a picture of your artwork! I\u2019d love to see it and would come to the opening if I could!", "100% NTA here, I would personally cut them off for a while if at all possible and not invite them to anything moving forward and not talk to them and when they call just say I\u2019m busy like you always seem to be when I need you.  Maybe they will get the hint then and try harder to be there for you as much as your siblings.", "NTA I can\u2019t imagine why any parent would do that. My parents were completely disinterested & disengaged but still showed up for major events.", "NTA. Maybe you could have managed the problem without flipping out. But your emotions are very well justified. You also let your parents know about your feelings albeit in a wrong way by flipping out and yelling but I personally suggest you talk to them again in a calm atmosphere and sort out any misunderstandings.\n\nBut this a very real problem that many siblings face. Parents always forget a basic rule of parenting, that is, treating their children equally. Even our democracy preaches equality. It's also the same for us children too. I, personally won't say that I love one parent more than the other either through words or actions. The same I also expect from my parents.", "NTA. It sounds to me like you got angry and yelled at them because this has been building up over a long time. This dinner date incident, standing alone, would be hurtful but maybe not as big of a deal. But it sounds like there's been a pattern of them routinely letting you down. I'm sorry, OP. You deserve better.", "NTA - They have a pattern of behavior and choices and you finally had enough and called them out on it. I would suggest No Contact if possible, because they already have shown who they are.", "NTA, its not just this event you have flipped out on, it's years and hundred of missed moments that have made you feel less then other family members. Your parent suck and suck hard, they don't deserve your emotion, time or effort, if they can't be bothered to be parents go NC and don't be their child and focus on you! very sorry that they made you feel like this.

And i will never understand how someone could think he would be the AH for yelling. In such emotional situations it's completly normal to yell, scream and cry.

You hit your boiling over point.  Your parents totally shit on you with this museum thing.  They can go to dinner any day I bet.  Even if they can't, friends are from way out of town or something, they could still go to your opening with those friends to celebrate something their daughter put so much time and energy into and is proud of.\n\nI'm sorry they don't respect you.  Do try and keep your temper in the future though.", "NTA .. they deliberatly chose to book dinner.. women are allowed too be angry and show anger which you did.", "NTA. \n\nYou should learn to control your anger better (in general) but in this situation imma say just go for it.\n\nGladly tell them to fuck off.", "NTA.  You have every right to be angry, and while blowing up at them probably solved nothing, at least you finally got all of that hurt out in the open.  It\u2019s in the universe now, they can\u2019t pretend you never told them how you felt.  I\u2019m so sorry, it really sucks being the kid that your parents make no effort for.  My advice is lower your expectations of them, and stop inviting them to things and sharing your achievements with them, so that you will stop being disappointed in their disinterest.", "NTA and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. They sound wildly disengaged and you did your part to tell them multiplr times ahead of time. No caring parent should constantly push off their child like that", "NTA but stop inviting them. They showed they don't care.", "NTA You\u2019ve remained calm and dealt with your parents ignoring your accomplishments for 22 years. This was something that was so incredibly important to you that you reminded them every 2 days of how important it was and they still can\u2019t show up for you. I\u2019m so sorry. Tell them they aren\u2019t invited anymore and won\u2019t ever be invited to anything in your life ever again, so long as it is safe for you to say that to them. If you still rely on them for anything, just go to your opening and enjoy your time with your true family, the one you chose, your friends who love you and support you. And when other life milestones come up, just don\u2019t invite your parents. Let them wonder why they are invited to the wedding if you get married or why they will never meet their grandchildren if you have kids. \n\nCongratulations on the opening and I hope you have a wonderful evening!", "NTA sounds like this has been brewing for a while. Your parents suck", "NTA.\n\nIt's good that you flipped out; they should know how they made you feel.\n\nI'm sorry, but they just don't care. Going forward, just know that and your hopes won;t be dashed.\n\nI'd recommend going LC on them. Don't call or visit. When they call, tell them you're in the middle of something and you'll call back. Then don't. Some posters will be Pollyannas and tell you not to react, but, believe me, it feels very good.", "Flipping out is never a good look of you want to not be an asshole.

You for yelling, and your parents for scheduling a conflicting event and not trying to schedule around it.", "ESH", "[deleted]", "ESH.  You're an adult.  I understand that your feelings are hurt (and absolutely reasonable for you to feel that way).  But you can handle this without yelling or cursing.  The truth is, you might actually make more impact on them by calmly saying, \"this is very important to me.  I've asked you to attend.  I feel completely rejected and ignored that you cannot make time to celebrate this milestone with me.\"  \n\n\nAnd, of course, they absolutely can cancel on the restaurant.  There might be a fee, but there are no \"restaurant police\" that will show up at your house to frog march them down to dinner.  They could (and I'm just blue-skying here) \\*invite their friends to your exhibition\\*.  They could keep their social commitment to the friends \\*and\\* support you in your art.  \n\n\nYou have every right to be hurt and upset.  It sounds like your parents may be behaving in a very narcissistic way.  If so, it is unlikely that they will ever change or be able to show you the kind of attention that you're craving.  If you're not already discussing this with a therapist, it might be valuable.  \n\n\nYour parents have been hurting you and disappointing you for a long time.  My guess is that they will continue to do so.  You can't control them.  You can only control how you respond to them, and what you expect of them.", "You were out of line getting nasty with your parents but this is no small mistake and you are completely justified for being upset just not in the way you showed it.\n\nHowever, when they say they want to come even less because of the way you acted, is wrong. \n\nThey knew how important it was to you because you made that abundantly clear and they chose to make inconsequential plans instead? Gross.\n\nYou have a right to be upset, going nuclear wasn't cool though.", "Bigtime TAH here. You never yell at your parents. You shoud treat them with the respect they deserve. Being upset id fine. Nothing wrong with being disapointed... but not yelling. And I guess all your firends are your age and also lack respect to their parents.\nSit down with your parents and explain.

It gets easier when you stop having the expectation that they will show up, just assume it will always be like this and then it\u2019s less disappointing when it happens.", "NTA\n\nBut stop setting yourself up for disappointment, OP. Seriously.\n\nMove out, don't tell them.\n\nFind your dream job, don't tell them.\n\nMeet the love of your life, don't tell them.\n\nGet married, don't tell them.\n\nSee how long it takes them to notice lol", "NTA \n\nHoly shit the reasons cited why they've not turned up for your important milestones blows my mind! Your parents are not just AH but that's cruel.\n\nHow do you get on with your siblings? Are they in agreement with you? It makes no difference to the judgement, I just hope you feel prioritised and important to somebody in your family. Are you the middle child? I'm just wracking my brain as to why they behave like that.", "Big time NTA. And the fact that they said \"now we want to come even less\" tells me they didn't want to come much to begin with, and they most likely planned that dinner knowing it was the same day as your exhibit.  \n\nI'm curious though if you've ever broached the subject of always feeling left out with them, or if this was everything coming to a boiling point for the first time.  They're still in the wrong, but if this is the first they're hearing of it, they were probably blindsided", "NTA but this is where I would be super petty. I would take a picture with my painting and blast on social media how proud you are of yourself and that you wished your parents cared enough to show for this one event but they refused. Thank literally everyone else for supporting you when they didn't. Make sure they're tagged in everything, and then don't answer their calls or texts for at least a week \ud83d\ude01", "You\u2019re NTA in this situation at all. \n\nBut until you realize that your parents will never act like loving parents who are interested you, you\u2019ll continue to suffer the heartbreak of crushed hope. They are crappy parents. Period. They will not give you the love, attention, or respect that you deserve. Now is the time to embrace the family you chose. Friends who are more family than the one you have. Choose the people who show you they care, and move on from constant disappointment. \n\nCongratulations on showing your art.", "I was a \u201cglass child\u201d in my home growing up, too. Adjust your expectations down. Like, on the floor. Send them invitations to things because they will get pissy with you if you don\u2019t, but never expect to be a priority to them. Go out and socialize, find people worth connecting with, people who will be glad to support you the way you support them.", "LC/NC is the way forward for you my friend....", "The fact they called their mistake a small one knowing how much it meant to you speaks volumes. Not sure if you are an adult and moved out yet. But when you do, go no contract.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry that they treat you like this.  You deserve better.", "NTA.\n\nStop talking to them completely until you get a sincere apology. You may never get it, but you would never be disappointed by their lack of love for you again. Grieving them now will be better for you in the long run.", "Not at all, OP. NTA. I think they are gaslighting you. You are not priority for them. Now you are an adult, it is time to manage your expectations about your parents.", "NTA and get yourself a therapist and stop holding space for people who don\u2019t value you even if they are your parents. \n\nGood luck to you at your show \ud83d\ude42", "\"Now we want to come even less\" what kind of insolent, 13 year old mentality is that shit? \n\nIt's clearly only intended to spurn you, since they weren't coming anyway. And no, you're not spoiled for calling them out that toxic crap.\n\nFuck em, you do you. Invite the people that will be there for you, not cause they realized last second what colossal twats they are being and try to play it off as no big deal.\n\nMan.... that pulled something close to home out of me...", "NTA. Your folks don\u2019t give a shit about you. \n\nTrouble is, you seem to give a shit about them. Time to stop.", "NTA. It\u2019s not spoiled to want your parents to show up for you\u2014that\u2019s literally what being a parent /means/. That said, stop including them in your life. Don\u2019t offer them a chance to be involved anymore. They\u2019ve made it abundantly clear how much of a priority you are to them (not at all) and you deserve to celebrate your accomplishments with people who appreciate you. It\u2019s not a small mistake\u2014it\u2019s a pattern of behavior. You deserve to be celebrated, too. It\u2019s time to put some distance between you. Take care of yourself. x", "NTA. At all.", "NTA. You need to start distancing. It sounds like you still live with your parents. I know the economy sucks, but if you have friends in your art program, start getting the word out that you need a place to live. Someone most likely could use a roommate. After a few months of low contact, I think you will begin to see how dependent you were on them emotionally, and how easy it was to let yourself be hurt by them. When you are truly an adult, their opinions and actions don't matter as much. You were completely within the right to yell at them and tell them off, but you now need to face the fact that as far as they are concerned, your feelings don't matter and probably never will.", "NTA but bear in mind you are an adult now; your parent\u2019s treatment shouldn\u2019t cause you to lose your shit anymore. You have the option of just walking away", "NTA - with the history you have described, your feelings and response were totally valid. Their response sounds like textbook manipulation to me. \n\nYou have identified a pattern of behavior. You could give them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps it was innocent, they hadn't noticed they were doing it, etc., but even that sounds like a stretch. From what you describe in this specific case, they have had regular and frequent reminders for weeks. This sounds very much like they made a conscious choice to plan their dinner date for the same time, which should remove any doubt around if their past behavior towards you was intentional.\n\nOnce you called them out on it, they chose not to own their \"mistake\", but to try flipping the script on you, and make this all about your \"bad\" behavior.  There is the classic manipulation.\n\nRegardless of your path forward, I suspect you will find yourself much happier if you stop giving them opportunities to put you second/last, and make sure that you put yourself first. \n\nYou likely won't gain much by arguing with them on the topic, and you will see repeats of this behavior. Invite friends, family, etc to your important events instead of your parents, and when they inevitably ask why your parents are not there, be honest, and surround yourself with people who make you feel like you do matter. Your parents either get embarrassed and/or angry about you \"telling lies\" or \"airing dirty laundry\", which you back up with a detailed list of all the times they have done this, or in some rare cases they have an epiphany and come around. \n\nI would bet money that they never change no matter what you do, and you would do well to make choices and temper your expectations accordingly.", "This seems ripe for going no contact.  Unfortunately,  your parents won't notice since you are the invisible child. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I am taking over as your honorary mom. I am so proud of you for your work on your painting!! It\u2019s beautiful and you deserve lots of praise for it. It is a big deal to have your art in a museum, and I am so proud of you.", "NTA they could do both.  Late dinner", "NTA. It\u2019s not ONE little mistake. It\u2019s the latest in a series of little mistakes and combined it becomes one HUGE mistake.\nAlso, love the gaslighting they used by saying your behaviour made them want to come even less. They\u2019re trying to make you believe your behaviour is why they don\u2019t show up. Great parenting right there. Not.\nI hope your friends have been more supportive.\nCompletely NTA. But your parents are.", "NTA. I have kids just a little younger than you and I would move heaven and earth to be at their events. Especially ones that were this important to them. Heck, if I knew you and you invited me, I would go to your show. I\u2019d be so excited! \n\nIdk if you still live with them, but if you do you should move out asap. If you don\u2019t live with them, it\u2019s time to go very LC with them. Maybe read some things online or in the library about neglectful parents. Take time to come to terms with your shitty family of origin.", "NTA It would have been better if you had remained calm but your feelings have been building for awhile.", "NTA  Oh My! You deserve better.  Your parents are choosing a dinner date over your first public art exhibition? Your hurt feelings are warranted.  It seems that you notified them, invited them, and reminded them and they still made other plans.  I am so sorry this is happening to you..\n\nMy heart hurts for you.  What your life plans?  Can you earn enough to move out?  Can you continue to make art and live apart from them?", "NTA.  Go to the opening and enjoy your accomplishment, it should be an interesting time and you said others would be there for you, enjoy them and their interest, along with all the other art and artists there.  \n\nAs you build your life, consider building it away from your parents.  You will find real family in others.  I don't mean cut them off or anything like that but set yourself up in life as you grow in a way that you are not beholden to their mind games.  You give them your power when you react emotionally to their betrayals, try to find ways to work through this unfair dynamic without giving them the satisfaction of feeling like they have a right to be cruel to you.  And this was a cruel thing to do to you.\n\nIf I had children, I would have loved to go to an art opening where their work was on display!  Openings are so interesting in so many ways, I hope you go and are able to enjoy it.", "Pam Beasley?", "NTA  but you are definitely being raised by at least one.", "NTA\n\nThe key part of this is that they said they wanted to come less than they did before. If they wanted to support you in the first place, they wouldn\u2019t have made the dinner reservation, and even if it was an honest mistake, they would\u2019ve cancelled it regardless of price. They clearly never had any interest in showing up and tried to make a reason as to why they couldn\u2019t. As others have said, just cut them off. Don\u2019t tell them about anything, and if they invite you to something you don\u2019t necessarily want to do, give them a taste of their own medicine and schedule something with others that are close to you at the same time", "NTA. They are gaslighting you. Don't invite them to anything else ever. Be done with them for your own sanity please. Your friends can be your found family. It hurts and you'll question yourself constantly, but once you get used to the lack of stress associated with wondering if they'll finally notice you, you'll feel loads better.", "NTA That's not a small mistake. It's a total disregard for you. I'm sorry your parents are assholes. It's time for you to try to get distance and gather around you people who care for and celebrate you. Congratulations, btw. That's a wonderful success with your art!", "NTA. Honestly your parents can go fuck themselves. Congratulations on your (hopefully first of many) museum feature for your artwork!", "NTA\n\nDon't invite them to anything and start talking to them less, or not at all. I don't even understand how parents can be sooo inconsiderate", "They seemingly have the misconception that you don\u2019t need or want their support as much as your siblings do- and of course are wrong- however- you did keep reminding them so they don\u2019t have a valid excuse for booking the dinner. \nWhy can\u2019t they cancel the dinner? \nNTAH", "Oh, I feel you. My grandma planned my graduation party right after my ceremony for high school. I have no pics of me with my friends in our gowns because \"they'll bring them to your party & you get them then\" and I must have \"mouthed off\" because then I'm being yelled at to get going & am then cornered in my room for embarrassing her (at which point i yelled back & people were showingup) & that I ruined her life.  Plus, she wouldn't let me leave for any reason & I never got pics.\n\nNarcissistic parents never understand how or why you act that way & try to mind fuck you into believing it's somehow your fault.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - that was a very appropriate response. I'm sorry that they've treated you this way all this time.", "can you invite any uncles, grandparents etc????", "why cant they go to dinner another day. are you not important to them?", "NTA, your parents said it all when they said they want to come even LESS. In other words they never wanted to go and support you and now they call you spoiled for wanting them to show an ounce of care for you. They are both the big AH.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nThe fact that they said \u201cthey feel\nLike coming even less\u201d means they weren\u2019t going to come at all anyway.", "NTA. You're parents are awful. I'll go to you're art exhibit OP", "NTA - your parents are the AHs, and honestly at 22...this is probably where I'd be looking to move out and go LC or NC with parents.", "NTA and it\u2019s a very manipulative tactic for them to use your reaction as a reason for not wanting to come instead of recognizing it was their careless actions that cause your reaction in the first place.", "NTA, absolutely and 100%.\n\nFamily is the people that makes us feel happy and safe, DNA has nothing to do with it.\n\nErgo, they are not your family; if you live with them, make plans to move out as soon as possible/feasible and tell them nothing - if you're already independent, drop them entirely.\n\nLife gets so much better when we leave the toxic people behind us.", "NTA, are you middle child? Sounds like middle child treatment they are giving. Which sucks. Just guard your heart and emotions.", "NTA\n\n Your parents aren't that into you. Welcome to the club. Growing up, if it required money or effort, it was out of the question for me. It took me a long time to figure that out.  I have since made changes in how ideal with my family.", "NTA...and this hurt my heart. Some parents have no clue what a privilege it is for their children to WANT to share their lives with them. My daughter lives on her own now and I cherish every moment she chooses to include me in what she has going on...she doesn't have to do that, and if you choose not include your parents in the future that is 100% on them.", "NTA\n\nCurious as to whether you\u2019re the eldest or middle child, having witnessed family dynamics in my extended relations there is quite a lot of similarities that make me shudder.\n\nOp, please consider therapy of some sort as you\u2019re very hurt and angry which is completely understandable but you need to heal yourself so you don\u2019t carry this with you for many years. Also go low contact with parents as much as possible if you still live with them and try to find a way to move out as this is imo an abusive relationship you have with them and it won\u2019t improve.\n\nFamily can be the people we choose for ourselves rather than what we are born into", "OP, I hope you know how amazing you are that, with so little encouragement from your parents, you would work so incredibly hard on your art project!!! You sound like a gem! If I knew where it was and lived close by, I would show up and be your mom for the evening. Keep on being strong and find the good people out there!!!", "Honestly it sounds like they did it on purpose. If they planned the reservation before you mentioned your event, then they would have told you immediately. And if they planned it after you mentioned your vent, then it means they didn't want to go to your event and wanted to go far enough to hurt you by doing something else instead.\n\nThey mention this the day of the exhibition? They are not cowards, they are AH and terrible parents.\n\nNTA. From now on, I'd invite other people instead. If your parents get offended that they aren't invited, you can just tell them that since they clearly don't care, you are inviting people willing to be there and support you.", "\u201cOf course you were going to lose your cool eventually.\u201d Keyword is eventually. This is a lifelong pattern of outright rejection masked as busyness or forgetfulness or higher priorities. All perfectly understandable, so if you protest, they become victims. OP, your parents are sneaky cruel, the worst kind. This is total bullshit. Stop inviting them to wound you. They probably are amazed and bemused that you continue to treat them like the loving parents they clearly will never be. NTA x 1000!", "Mine were/are disinterested, but I simply stopped expecting anything of them and went NC. They only found out about my last project because it happened to turn up on the front page of a site that my dad regularly browses.\n\n(One would think that they would be disappointed that I did not tell them, but they are that utterly disinterested)\n\nNTA.", "Yes! That wording jumped out at me as well!", "They CAN pretend OP never told them. Unless there were a LOT of witnesses, they'll pretend nothing was said, EXCEPT in moments they feel like they can hold this over OP's head.", "Snubbing your daughter\u2019s art exhibition is not a good look either.", ">You shoud treat them with the respect they deserve.\n\nI'm confused, it sounds like this is exactly what happened. NTA.", "But you don\u2019t understand, now that op yelled at them they want to go to her exhibit even less. /s\n\nWhat does that even mean, they weren\u2019t going to go, but now what, they\u2019re going to not go even harder. Are they going to get a table that is the farthest from the museum?", "Also, their friends from out of town probably would have enjoyed going with them to their daughter's exhibition... If they had bothered to invite them, or even mentioned what their daughter was doing, which I'm sure they didn't.", "i hope you consoled her. poor kid", "Yeah, ESH. Not sure why everyone is downvoting me. Her parents are assholes, and she asked if she was an asshole for flipping out.", "It means they have the self control and sensibility of a fucking kindergartener and have nothing else to try to use as blame.", "It means they weren\u2019t going to go, but now will blame they\u2019re not going on OP\u2019s behavior.  NTA.", "I feel like at least some kindergartners have better foresight abilities than these parents. (Or least that they telegraph, they knew exactly what they were doing, they\u2019re only mad because op reminded them what they did was wrong and they only have themselves to blame)", "Here's the thing. People NEVER only have themselves to blame. They can always blame someone else, or some 3rd party force, or the messenger.\n\nThe issue is (from my experience at least) people don't like hearing how they failed you, and some even seem functionally unable to recognize their own fault.\nNot 1 to 1, but its worth noting each of the people I know who act like this are colossal narcissists too.", "Exactly, if it wasn\u2019t the reservation, it would be something else, no matter how illogical, no matter if it was of their doing, they will find something else to blame just so that they\u2019ll never have to feel guilt."]}
