{"id": 6560, "submission_id": "1044ilb", "title": "AITA for trying to stop my SIL from getting an Amazon delivery employee fired?", "selftext": "I (41m) had a battle with my SIL (39f) yesterday afternoon. Amazon was delivering a package to her house yesterday and partially drove over her lawn. The driver attempted to do a 3 point turn, but because of the narrow driveway/turnaround, they ended up driving their right side tires over the edge of their concrete paver walkway and about 25' of lawn.  Because it had rained the last couple days, the tire rut went down into the grass about 6\" and the half dozen pavers were pushed down an 1\" under the weight of the truck. The entire incident was captured on her 4 exterior Ring cameras and 1 Ring doorbell, ironically enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, she's asking my wife and I how she goes about getting ahold of Amazon legal to have this fixed and have the woman driving the truck terminated. I interject that the damage is really no big deal and I will have it fixed for her. I work in the construction business and have relationships with many sub contractors. I called my landscaper who does work all the time for me, and he said it was no issue at all. He would spot repair the loam, finish rake it and seed it. As for the 5 or 6 pavers, he said again this is no issue. You pop the pavers, add additional bedding sand flush to grade, and then replace the pavers. He even has bags of the polymer top sand that \"lock\" all the pavers in together. How much I ask? \"Nah, don't worry about it. This won't take my guys more than 30 mins, I'll have them swing by on the way home tonight and take care of it for her.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I call SIL to let her know this is all good and she says Nope, do not send my guy, as she needs to see justice for this. I asked her why and she's goes on about how this woman could have killed a kid or caused far more damage to someone else's property and on and on. Just stupidity if you ask me. Driving over the edge of someone's lawn is not the same as running down kids playing soccer in the yard. We end up in this huge argument, she thinks I'm totally out of line and needs to mind my business. Voices get raised until finally my wife and I leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I know it's not my business to force involvement, but my issue is I know how poorly Amazon and it's sub-contractors treat their drivers. There are cases of the drivers urinating in cups to not alter their route, and possibly be terminated. As subs, they're not given benefits, forced to work long shifts and don't get shift breaks for lunch. Even on my SIL's Ring cams, you could see the van had boxes on the passenger seat and passenger side of the dash. The driver definitely had poor visibility to that side mirror, but it gives you an idea of just how full this van was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I just have sympathy for the drivers, especially around the more hectic holidays. If I could make this issue disappear in a matter of 30 mins in an afternoon, why not just leave it there? Why do you NEED to see the woman lose her livelihood? It was just an accident, no?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for involving myself in my SIL's Amazon battle?", "created_utc": 1672939340, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1044ilb/aita_for_trying_to_stop_my_sil_from_getting_an/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
