If they don't wish to do that, seems the issues are fixed anyways.", "Nta, why would you want to bring your child around someone that would lie to cps and cover up child neglect?", "NTA.  Who do you go to bed with at the end of the day?  That\u2019s the side you\u2019re on.

How come SIL is asking about your daughter but not your stepdaughter ?\n\nEDIT : I'm going with ESH.\n\nEvery adult in this situation is just as selfish as the other.\n\nTeenage pregnancies, expecting the grandparents to babysit, drugs, abuse...
