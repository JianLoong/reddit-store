Considering he is a grown up with his own job, he should know that a good work space is more important than him playing video games.

I have a feeling this post is slightly skewed.. I think OP did not want husbands stuff around the house, and gave him the room to put it in as long as it stayed there.

It's THAT important to me.", "Depends on your husband and how important the space is to him.  I don't think it's unreasonable but only you know your husband and using reddit comments in that conversation will result in rage if he is anything like me.", "Thanks yes shed isn't an option", "it's not who deserves more space than someone else. I'm just saying, that she wouldn't want to share a space with him. Let me give you an example. I am sure the OP has her own sense of style and the husband who's man cave is set to his likings don't want things moved. To have her deal with that nagging from his husband, it's best NOT to share a space is all I'm saying. \n\nOf course the OP deserves her own space. that's why I suggested a shed. I don't know it might be a fun project. I've seen so many sheds catered to the wife that it looks absolutely amazing.", "I apologize and also for your predicament. You are important. You WFH and take care of the kids and all that but it's weird your husband is not budging or wanting to share a space with you at all.", "I don't know!!! That's why I'm looking for help. He's a great guy but on this one thing he's not willing to listen to reason I feel....", "He's no interest in decorating the rest of the house. I do show him things before I buy them though.... potentially could put one or two things out but he has about 100 star trek ships / star wars stuff.....", "It's small but definitely still space for two of us", "My thoughts too which is why were here!!", ">Then use the open plan area. Sell the couch or TV and but a nice desk to go right in the middle\n\nYou seem to have missed this bit:\n\n>I WFH 4 days a week and am on a tiny desk in the open plan dining area which is **really difficult when kids are home**/ need to work late.\n\nTaking more space isn't the issue - having a door to avoid distractions from kids is the need.", "Do you have anybody who you can borrow space from? If so, set something up there. You get your own space away from distraction, husband keeps his space. It's a win win.", "OP clearly has said she doesn't mind sharing a space. If there isn't enough space in the house to have a man cave and a work space, work really does take priority. There's no reason the husband can't move his things into the shared space. You know why he doesn't? Because of the noise and the kids would constantly be on him. So he's being very selfish in not even being willing to compromise on sharing the only space in the house that really can be shared in that manner.", "Time to put your foot down then. You need a space you can work in undisturbed. He won't even need to change the decorating. If he refuses, it's obvious he values his play time more than your work time. He thinks his relaxation is more important than your job....", "He is not your boss or in charge.  Stop treating him as though he is. Tell you are taking the room.... seems fair.  He does the exact thing to you.  \n\nHe doesn't get to decide ..... NTA", "Persuading him is above our pay grade. All we can say is you are NTA.", "Would you let him put one or two things out, or would you let him incorporate all of his memorabilia into the home?  How did he get to have the room in the first place?"]}
