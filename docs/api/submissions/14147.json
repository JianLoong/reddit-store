He met my mom(79F) 2 years later the RO and at their 4th year,I came in. I(36M) was a real surprise but they had me and I grew as an only child and I didn't know my brother existed until I was 12,when he tried to contact me by coming to my school. They got married that year just so my mom would be his next of kin and my brother wouldn't be able to attest against his will. Dad left him nothing.\n\nDad and mom were adamant that he wasn't allowed to contact me until I was 21 and my dad threatened him with more legal actions that he didn't take if he ever approached me before I was 21 so he never came close. I also knew he had borderline personality disorder and he was working as a carpenter. When I was 21,I met him and I can easily say,he is an emotional mess. He relapsed multiple times into the rehab,used other substances and had multiple felonies. I saw him maybe 3-4 times before he tried to guilt me for his own actions and I had to call the cops because I felt unsafe. After that,my dad's lawyer helped me to get a RO and he never approached to me again.

You have a restraining order, the police wouldn't have gotten involved if there wasn't a reason.\n\nBe kind to yourself.

Only the right of the next of kin to decide who gets to come to the funeral. \n\n\nPlus the op\u2019s dad didn\u2019t want him there.

Which at the end of the day is the only thing that maters.", "It also seems pretty clear that the father abandoned his child after his first wife's death, if you read the backstory, so the kid (22 is a KID) had to deal with a traumatic double-loss.  It is 100% obvious that this is what the dead dad did, so no wonder he had so many issues (and likely, why the entire extended family sides with brother).\n\nIf he was drunk or making a scene, absolutely.

After that,my dad's lawyer helped me to get a RO and he never approached to me againAfter that,my dad's lawyer helped me to get a RO and he never approached to me again. \n\n(a) He saw him 3-4 times in his whole life, has no back story as to why he \"felt unsafe\" and his dad - aka his brother's deadbeat dad - got his own lawyer to get a RO to keep him apart.\n\n(b) Where are the multiple ROs?  He got one 40+ years ago from the dad (again, likely for no reason)?\n\nThis is how deadbeat dads operate, FYI.   The rest of the relatives would be against the brother, as well, if he was so awful.  I think OP is naive to how cruelly his own father treated his brother, and I'm sure dad is VERY responsible for these issues in the first place.  (I know addicts. They don't get invited to weddings or other events.  But I've also seen them keep their shit together for short bursts of time, and lay low).", "I don't really know what that means, but you need to call the cops to enforce a restraining order. So some hired thug aka \"security\" called the police? (Funerals don't typically have security, unless his dad was the president or something).\n\nEither way, I don't think OP has ANY CLUE what happened, but at the bare minimum, he knows his own dad abandoned his son when he was 22 b/c he reacted w/ great trauma to his mother's untimely passing... and there is no way that throwing him in rehab and going NC wasn't further traumatizing... then just moved on with his \"new family.\"", "Well, congratulations. You just found out laws are different in other places.", "Your dedication to writing fanfiction about OP\u2019s brothers life is concerning and there is simply no evidence to support any of your claims.", "No kidding. Hence why I was asking for clarification on the situation. If he didn\u2019t continue to be a threat here there\u2019s no way a restraining order could be maintained for 14 years. Hence why so many original comments called op the AH. I personally don\u2019t think he is. I also wouldn\u2019t personally call his fathers other son his brother in this situation\u2026 but to each their own. Reddit is such a cesspool if AH\u2019s who love to pass judgment without clarification."]}
