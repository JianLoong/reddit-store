He met my mom(79F) 2 years later the RO and at their 4th year,I came in. I(36M) was a real surprise but they had me and I grew as an only child and I didn't know my brother existed until I was 12,when he tried to contact me by coming to my school. They got married that year just so my mom would be his next of kin and my brother wouldn't be able to attest against his will. Dad left him nothing.\n\nDad and mom were adamant that he wasn't allowed to contact me until I was 21 and my dad threatened him with more legal actions that he didn't take if he ever approached me before I was 21 so he never came close. I also knew he had borderline personality disorder and he was working as a carpenter. When I was 21,I met him and I can easily say,he is an emotional mess. He relapsed multiple times into the rehab,used other substances and had multiple felonies. I saw him maybe 3-4 times before he tried to guilt me for his own actions and I had to call the cops because I felt unsafe. After that,my dad's lawyer helped me to get a RO and he never approached to me again.
