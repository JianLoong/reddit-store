I would like us to stay in a nice hotel on our wedding night, after the busy day it would be nice to have the night together as newlyweds and enjoy a luxury hotel room with champagne and what not.  My partner feels that we should just come home along with H after the wedding and stay at home with him being in the guest bedroom. \nI've tried for a few weeks now to get my feelings across that I am not OK with a guest staying in our home on our wedding night. I would much rather prefer he stays in a hotel and we come home alone, or we stay in a hotel and he can have the house to himself! \n\nWe aren't going on an immediate honeymoon.  The day after the wedding my partner plans on being up and ready to go out at 7am to show H the city we live in and go to tourist spots etc. I'm also not keen on such an early start the day after my wedding and would rather take it easy and relax. \n\nWhen I bring this issue up my partner calls me selfish, ungrateful and calls me an AH. He says I should just 'get over myself' and accept that this is the way things are. H is travelling such a long distance to attend and the least we can do is put him up in our house for a few nights.

Your wedding day is supposed to be one of the most important days of your life and your husband can't even give you that night alone? Is his friend always going to come before you? What else comes before you? What else does he get the only say on?\n\nYou're lucky you've planned a micro wedding. If I were you I'd either cancel or not sign the marriage certificate.

Honestly ask yourself why you want to marry someone who so obviously disrespects you on the days that should be the most lovey dovey...", "NTA, your fiance is a major AH.

THat's a hard NO.", "NTA- Girl if I were you I would be booking myself a luxury hotel room with all the beautiful perks of a spa bath, Complimentary champagne, Breakfast in bed and enjoy YOUR wedding night alone while your new husband and H have their sleepover at your place lol", "NTA. I think the idea of getting a nice hotel room for the two of you and let the friend stay in the house is a great idea. Also your future husband can wait a day to show the city to the friend after your wedding. He is being selfish and the friend for not backing you up either.", "NTA.

Little story for you: my first marriage was in my hometown & husband had a group of friends come to the wedding. After the reception, we drove 2-1/2 hours to our house & his 6 buddies followed. They all trooped in & proceeded to party the rest of the night.  Yeah, I went to bed ALONE on my wedding night!  And he just shrugged it off like it was perfectly fine.  That marriage lasted 1-1/2 years.", "NTA. Sounds like you should call off the wedding and put Herbert up for a few nights. Herbert and your partner could do the tourist things during his visit.\n\nReschedule the wedding for a time when (if ever) your partner considers the wedding to be a serious and important occasion.", "NTA.  I think your fiance needs to learn that you come first and not his friend.  Do you want to marry this guy?  I don't like that he uses foul language toward you.  That is not love.", "NTA. Wow, maybe after your new husband shows his friend around town, he can do the weekly grocery shopping, pick up the dry-cleaning, clean the toilets, and meet the boys for dinner. I mean, since to him your actual wedding seems to be no big deal and not anything to be celebrated, all those things should be just fine for him to do instead of spending your first day together as a married couple.\n\nIf this is really how important you are to him, is this someone you want to be legally tied to for the rest of your life?", "Hoooooly..... Girl, NTA. My mother and sister were staying at our house for the week leading up to our wedding because they too had to fly in from another country, and my mom herself insisted she should book a bnb for the last two nights so that they would not impose on our wedding night. In her words, \"you (hopefully) only have one wedding night\".\n\nI can understand the friend maybe not being able to afford a hotel, but you offered reasonable alternatives. Honestly, I find your fianc\u00e9e's persistence and anger odd...", "NTA - in fact this is a big red flag!  Why does you fianc\u00e9 want his friend, or any one else, near you on your wedding night?  Furthermore, why does he want to take his friend out the day after?  This makes me think his friends will always come before you in the future.", "NTA\n\nThe man doesn't even want to spend the wedding night alone with you.\n\nHe's trying to gaslight you into thinking that wanting to spend the wedding night alone with your spouse is selfish.\n\nHe's nasty. Disrespects you. Calls you names.\n\nI wouldn't marry him. I don't know why you are. It's not to late to cancel. And it's always better to cancel a wedding than to be in an abusive marriage and then divorce.", "NTA but he doesn\u2019t see this like you do and I\u2019m talking about the wedding.  I\u2019d talk to him about how important this wedding really is in his mind. Bet he isn\u2019t thinking about it the same since you two - in his mind- are already married since you\u2019ve lived together 6 years.  It won\u2019t be new it will be another day to him after a big celebration of that.  I would sit down and ask him some questions.  If you had never lived together I\u2019d be ticked at these plans.  But perhaps it is because he doesn\u2019t realize the significance I this ceremony, at least to you.", "NTA and DON'T ACCEPT THIS!\n\nYour fiance is trying to bully you into this. The entire plan is to idiot for words. Just...wtf?\n\nYou need to put your foot down on this, or better, ask yourself if this isn't a huge red flag and reason to bail.", "NTA. Rethink this marriage. Your fianc\u00e9 is more interested in his friend than in what you want. If he's treating you like this just before marriage, how will he treat you afterwards.\n\nIf you can't be selfish on your wedding night, when can you be selfish? What does he expect you to be grateful for?", "NTA, don\u2019t marry him though.", "He is showing you how he values you. Run far, run fast. Do not expect him to change how he views your opinion.", "NTA. Your points are completely valid. Why are you marrying this man who clearly has no thought or regard for you? He's more interested in being with H and his comfort. Sounds more like your fiance should be marrying H because you aren't a priority in this relationship.", "NTA Your husband is unreasonable. Put your foot down", "NTA. Honestly, there are some seriously stupid people in this world, and your future husband is one of them. He's marring you, not his friend. Unless the friend is as brain dead as FH, they are likely to feel really weirded out by this behaviour.", "NTA. It's YOUR wedding. I'd stand my ground on this. This to me personally is a make or break type thing. If he can't see your point of view at all then you might wanna cut your losses", "He seems like a control freak do you really want to marry somebody like that they want somebody else there on your wedding night?

We still got a hotel room the night of our wedding! I'm sorry but your partner sounds awful. Does he often make unilateral decisions and then tell you to \"accept the way things are\"? That's a massive red flag imo", "NTA. No, no, no!!! PLEASE DO NOT MARRY THIS MAN. Get out while you still can. You deserve SO MUCH better.", "NTA, but I wouldn't marry him.", "For the love of god, *no one is supposed to be there at your wedding night but you and your spouse.

Your fiance is a piece of work tho.", "Seriously - this is your warning before you marry such a selfish ignorant disrepectful person. Does he even like you?

You are not his first priority. \n\nIts INSANE how he wants to spend your wedding night with his best friend coming over and then out the next morning to spend it with him.\n\nWhen someone shows you who they are believe it.", "Tell him his plans are fine HOWEVER you will be staying at a nice hotel after the wedding. Since he\u2019s more interested in spending the wedding night and next day with H, you\u2019ll make your own plans.", "\"Get over yourself\" are words used by a husband ten years after the wedding when the marriage has gone south and divorce is imminent.\n\nIt is not what a man tells his bride just before the wedding.\n\nNTA and cancel the whole thing. This is not love!", "NTA. But I think you have bigger issues. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s different in your country but usually the wedding night is supposed to be somewhat special and just the couple. I know a lot of people that choose to party late or do things differently, so it\u2019s whatever the couple chooses.\n\nHowever it\u2019s a huge problem that he has made this decision for you and is unwilling to compromise in any way. It\u2019s also a problem that he is calling you names. This could be foreshadowing for how he handles things in future when you have a difference of opinions.\n\nI\u2019m unclear on why you either can\u2019t pay to put the friend up for that night OR him stay in your place while you stay in a hotel for the night. If it\u2019s spending time with him, you could easily meet back up early the next day.\n\nI\u2019d turn the conversation back on him and point out that it\u2019s actually selfish and an AH move to unilaterally make a decision and not be willing to compromise at all.", "https://i.imgur.com/ct6i6P5.png", "Thanks everyone for the comments. \n\nI want to add that another reason why he refuses to get a hotel room is the cost of the room for one night. He feels that by the time we get to the hotel it will be late and we will go straight to bed, then up and away by 7am for tourism the next day. So really only spending 7-8 hours in an expensive room sleeping is pointless.", "Book the hotel. Your fiance needs to get the memo. Book yourself a spa treatment tor the day following and tell him to take his friend out. Give on the one and accept no less on the other. Otherwise, rethink things. You are not selfish. Your partner is being deliberately obtuse.", "NTA ? How are you ungrateful and selfish ? It\u2019s your wedding and none of it is about H !

Helping him save money on accommodations is reasonable due to the extra cost he\u2019s incurring just to attend. \n\nIt\u2019s also fine for your partner to want to wake up and spend time with him. Yes it\u2019s your wedding, but you\u2019ve lived together for 6 years and there is nothing new changing. During those years you\u2019ve never met H and it makes sense that your partner wants to spend some time with the friend who\u2019s coming from so far away. If you don\u2019t want to wake up and start your day so early - don\u2019t! Stay at the hotel until you have to check out and then meet up with them. Does that mean you won\u2019t be with your husband for a few hours? Yes. \n\nBut really. Who knows when your partner will see H again, and the reality is that nothing in your life is actually changing that day - you\u2019re just spending tons of money on a party and signing a legal document.", "I've been with my husband for 28 years. He has never, not once, called me any name and has never once told me to get over myself. He has never steamrolled over what I want or dismissed my feelings at any point.\n\nThat's not how loving people treat you. You should ask yourself why you don't think you deserve better than this.\n\nNTA", "Ding, Ding, Ding, he is verbally abusing you and cares more for his freind than he does for you. \n\nTell him we are alone at home or hotel with out H or the wedding is off. \n\nOr maybe juat walk away from the abuse and tell him the wedding is off anyway.", "NTA\n\n....but your fiance might be. Your feelings are perfectly normal, his are not. Playing host on your wedding night/morning after is ridiculous and not something that anyone in their right would expect of newlyweds.", "Are you offering H a hotel room? That's the crux of the issue. He's flying across the country to participate and support you as a couple and if he needs accommodations after doing so much for you - then accommodate him civilly.\n\nYWBTA if you don't get that H deserves some kind of courtesy in that regard. That business about your fianc\u00e9 showing Dave the sights the morning after your wedding is just ridiculous to me.

You have to find a way to communicate with him more about this. Seriously, he is calling you exactly what he is. He\u2019s being selfish and unreasonable and an asshole. and it\u2019s also kind of weird: why doesn\u2019t he want to stay at a hotel with you after the wedding? Does he not understand a wedding is a big deal?", "The thing is you and your fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t see this wedding as the same thing. You have been living together for 6 years. To him it seems like just a formality and not a big deal. It\u2019s just another day. Nothing is going to change once you day I do. So it\u2019s no big deal to have his friend stay in the same place as him. In fact he may even be more excited to see his friend than the wedding part. You in the other hand think this is a big deal and you want it to be romantic.\nYou want to spend the night with him alone. I think you should really look at whether the wedding is really what you think it is.", "My thoughts exactly!", "OP should cancel the wedding for sure but stay in the nice hotel by herself while she considers staying with this asshole.

I've never met H before, only spoke over messages.", "Humongous red flag.  If this is the (lack of) consideration he shows you on the most important event of your life, I cannot begin to imagine how he would treat you going forward.

Even if you do go to sleep it\u2019s your wedding night., you want to be alone with your husband and you\u2019re not asking for anything unreasonable. I worry about the big red flag here. Is this how your future concerns going to be met by him. I really think you need to stand your ground here, if this important to you. I really like the idea, if he doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s important spending your wedding night alone then I would rent a room myself, have breakfast in bed and invite me MOH or a close friend the next day for a spa day or spending the day doing something you like to do, while he\u2019s spends the day with H. If he disagrees then tell him he\u2019s being unreasonable and needs to get over himself!!! \n\nI wish you good luck and hope your able to work through this.

Your partner is already showing he doesn\u2019t care about your thoughts/wants for your freaking wedding!  And is being nasty when you express your completely understandable wishes for wedding night. I\u2019m sorry but he sounds like a complete asshole.  If on your wedding night he can\u2019t even respect these wishes I can\u2019t imagine how he will be in the future.
