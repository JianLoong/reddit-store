{"id": 17084, "submission_id": "13fskyd", "title": "AITA for making my child choose a different cake?", "selftext": "Edit 3: Thank you SO MUCH for all of the wonderful messages in my DMs telling me to get r-worded or jump off a bridge. :) I really appreciate everyone who took time out of their day to tell me my son would be better off without a mom because I asked him to choose a different filling in his birthday cake. GFY <3\n\nMy(23f) son, Jackson, recently turned five. We had a small party with some of his friends from daycare, my parents, and my boyfriend's family. Since he's been old enough to make a lot of his own decisions the past year, I've let him choose what he wants for his birthday. \n\nThis year, Jackson said that he wanted a chocolate birthday cake with blueberries in the middle and worms on top. I wasn't super sure about this combination of things so I told him that, while I know he likes it, his party guests probably wouldn't enjoy chocolate and blueberries and asked him to pick a different flavor. I suggested Oreos or raspberries instead of blueberries and he said he wanted to think about it. After a while he came back with a completely different cake idea (coconut strawberry lilo and stitch cake) and asked if we could have it instead. I approved his new idea so we got it ordered.\n\nAt the party, I was approached by my boyfriend's parents and accused of forcing interests on my child. I asked what they were on about and they said that Jackson had told them about the cake situation. I was confused as Jackson had been super excited about his cake. I talked to him after the party and he said that he originally wanted the worm cake but loves his lilo and stitch cake. I still feel like a bad mom for telling him to pick a different cake. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT because there seems to be confusion:\n\nI did not choose his coconut cake. I did not eat the cake because I do not like coconut. My son loves coconut which is why he chose it. I did not tell him that he couldn't have a worm cake. He chose a different cake design on his own. \n\nWe could not have multiple cakes due to not having the budget for it. I offered to make the cakes instead but he wanted it from the bakery we got my boyfriend's birthday cake from so that's where we got it from.\n\n\n\nEdit 2 - INFO\n\nMy boyfriend is not related to my son in any way. His parents are not my son's grandparents. My son's father is double my age and hasn't been in the picture since I was 17, before he was born.\n\nThe blueberry filling at the bakery we went to is very sweet and artificial tasting jam. My son hasn't had the filling but I have and know from similar things that he wouldn't really enjoy it.\n\nYes. My son really is 5. Yes. He does actually like Lilo and Stitch. No. Chocolate and blueberries are not a combo you usually see where we live. Yes. Chocolate covered FRESH blueberries are his favorite snack. No. I am not punishing him for wanting worms on his cake. I appreciate the worms. I have no issue with the worms.", "created_utc": 1683914936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fskyd/aita_for_making_my_child_choose_a_different_cake/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Shit happens - one incident of \"hey, maybe we don't do that\" over something as ultimately small as a cake flavor isn't going to give the kid trauma for life. If you're doing stuff like that all the time, then you're TA, because that'll screw a kid up for a long time, but odds are good he's not going to end up with some traumatic core memory of that one time his mom suggested picking a different flavor of cake - then proceeded to let him get exactly the second flavor and decorations he wanted.", "You said yourself \"asked him to pick a different flavor\".

Considering other people\u2019s tastes is a very important lesson in not becoming an entitled asshole. He went away, considered your point, and came back with a killer flavour combo ALL BY HIMSELF.

Not the situation, though.", "I know that the two things can go together because he loves chocolate covered blueberries.

Even on our big \"me\" moments, we need to be aware of and considerate towards those standing with us.\n\nWhile this is a good lesson to teach your son, and you didn't do it in an overbearing way, I do think you were being overly precious about the flavors and appearance. That combination actually sounds like it would work well, and I daresay more attendees would be anti-coconut than against chocolate blueberry. Coconut is a very dividing flavor many people hate, especially children. So in trying to teach him to think of his guests'experience, you wound up having him make a worse decision. A bit ironic.", "Slightly YTA: Don\u2019t give your son a choice if you won\u2019t follow through on it. \n\nThe first cake sounded fine gummy worms would actually go well with cake. \n\nBut coconut cake really surprised as that\u2019s a terrible option for cake. \n\nBut I do make my kids cakes and you be surprised what goes together well or even try first. \nBut don\u2019t give your kid options if you won\u2019t even do what they ask. But it is surprising what does go with cake and flavours.", "NTA\n\nThe people piling on you are being ridiculous. You didn't force him to change. Rather, you provided alternative options that might be more appetizing for everyone involved. \n\nI have a four-year-old. He likes to dip his apples in ketchup. It's a silly stage and very fun, but that doesn't mean everyone has to partake lol. \n\nThe weirdest part about this is your boyfriend's parents being so aggressive and rude. Are they often so quick to get in your face?", "YTA duh", "Nta.\nI give my children lots of age appropriate choices and involve them in lots of our decisions even if they don\u2019t get the ultimate choice.  Someone\u2019s they choose something I hadn\u2019t thought of that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate and I have to say no. Sometimes I think they choose something that might not be the best choice for whatever reason and I might discuss that with them or give them some input but still leave it up to them.\nI make the cakes and we\u2019ve had multiple trains, a peacock and  daleks and a very disastrous monkey I don\u2019t want to talk about. \ud83e\udd23 They usually choose a theme and I look at if it would be possible for me and discuss with them. \nDo I think chocolate and blueberries was a bad choice probably not but I don\u2019t think discussing choices with kids is necessarily a good thing. \n\nI do think giving fake \u201cchoices\u201d are bad and I do think overruling reasonable choices are bad. I do think discussing choices and providing more information helps children make informed decisions and learn critical thinking. I also like to discuss decisions I make with others and for children little decisions are how they learn these skills.\n\nIf I felt their friends wouldn\u2019t like their cake flavour I\u2019d mention that partly because I know my children would be disappointed if most of their friends didn\u2019t like the cake and might want t to compromise or provide an alternative eg cupcakes in the theme so we can have different flavours. If it was the theme I didn\u2019t change it or comment except in whether or not I thought it was possible or how I might be able to achieve it.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think blueberries and chocolate were probably worth the concern but I don\u2019t think discussing a flavour choice is a huge issue or means you are taking away his choices.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2018s just cake.
