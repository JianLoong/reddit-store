I wasn't super sure about this combination of things so I told him that, while I know he likes it, his party guests probably wouldn't enjoy chocolate and blueberries and asked him to pick a different flavor. I suggested Oreos or raspberries instead of blueberries and he said he wanted to think about it. After a while he came back with a completely different cake idea (coconut strawberry lilo and stitch cake) and asked if we could have it instead. I approved his new idea so we got it ordered.\n\nAt the party, I was approached by my boyfriend's parents and accused of forcing interests on my child. I asked what they were on about and they said that Jackson had told them about the cake situation. I was confused as Jackson had been super excited about his cake. I talked to him after the party and he said that he originally wanted the worm cake but loves his lilo and stitch cake. I still feel like a bad mom for telling him to pick a different cake.

I did not tell him that he couldn't have a worm cake. He chose a different cake design of his own volition. \n\nWe could not have multiple cakes due to not having the budget for it.

If you're doing stuff like that all the time, then you're TA, because that'll screw a kid up for a long time, but odds are good he's not going to end up with some traumatic core memory of that one time his mom suggested picking a different flavor of cake - then proceeded to let him get exactly the second flavor and decorations he wanted.", "You said yourself \"asked him to pick a different flavor\".

All the comments about how you\u2019re depriving your child are bonkers. You\u2019re doing the best you can with the tools you have, and kiddo said he wanted coconut and strawberry. Considering other people\u2019s tastes is a very important lesson in not becoming an entitled asshole. He went away, considered your point, and came back with a killer flavour combo ALL BY HIMSELF. I\u2019d be proud at my kid\u2019s taste and ability to be flexible when he considers hosting friends.", "My husband and I started throwing blueberries into brownie batter before cooking and it was FANTASTIC.", "I think chocolate with blueberries sounds good\u2026", "They aren't his grandparents.\n\nIt was framed as them bringing it up because of the cake but comments were made about it not being a \"traditional little boy\" themed party because he wanted Disney and picked out a lot of plant/flower decorations.\n\nI enjoy similar things as my kid and got his name from a popular Disney movie (I was 17 when he was born so tbh could be worse) so I can see why they'd think that. Not the situation, though.", "I know that the two things can go together because he loves chocolate covered blueberries. I've mentioned it in a few other comments but; He's had the cake before (boyfriend's birthday cake) but not the filling. I had the filling at a baby shower on a lemon cake and it's basically a very sweet/artificial blueberry jam. He's had similar things in the past and he probably would've disliked it.\n\nIt's also not a super common flavor combo where we're from so I doubt adults/other kids would've eaten the cake even if he didn't.", "Omg that sounds amazing! I was just trying to figure out what to do with blueberries I have that are on their last legs. Going to do this tonight!", "Blueberries are my thing. I eat a box a day. Costs a fortune but I don't drink alcohol or smoke so they're my vice.       \nProblem is my girls love them too, they share a box. We call them Bloobs.        \nIf my husband goes to the supermarket and asks if anyone wants anything he's met with a chorus of 'BLOOBS!'", "It sounds like your son was happy with the coconut cake and your MIL was determined to create drama. NTA", "He has had the cake but not the filling. I had the filling at a friend's baby shower and am pretty certain he would've had me scrape it off.", "People have a tendency to blow things FAR out of proportion on this subbreddit. It's insane sometimes.", "Highly recommend- I make chocolate-blueberry-walnut smoothies all the time and they're SO good", "That\u2019s totally fair. If you can, I\u2019d add this to the post. I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t ask him to change the design, just the filling?", "I only suggested a different filling. He changed the design and cake flavor by himself.", "Yeah, you\u2019re NTA then. You know your kid\u2019s preferences better than we do. Maybe next year you can find a bakery or recipe for a chocolate blueberry cake if he\u2019s still interested!"]}
