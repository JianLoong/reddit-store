{"id": 10248, "submission_id": "1150pav", "title": "AITA for giving my children the same treatment?", "selftext": "Please forgive me if this is formatted incorrectly, I am new to Reddit. A coworker suggested I post here to get people\u2019s thoughts. \n\n\nThis happened a few years ago, but it seems like we\u2019re back to being upset with it. So long story short, my daughter has a long history with mental health issues. Fortunately my husband and I got her into residential treatment part way through high school and she was doing much better. Because of these issues, she did spend the rest of her high school experience getting caught up. And she was able to graduate. \n\nAnd with that, we expected her to either go to college or get a job if she wanted to continue living with us. She got a job for a short period but ended up leaving within 3 months. We spent months attempting to help but she didn\u2019t want it. The only thing she ended up doing was holing up in her room on her phone. So we decided enough was enough. She was 18 and needed to learn to take responsibility for herself. And she left. As a result, she cut off contact for 3 years. Which was her choice, we never blamed her for feeling upset. After a death in the family, we were back on speaking terms. She\u2019s done well for herself and I thought we were back to normal. But on an unrelated note my younger son has dropped out of high school and he\u2019s been given the same options she was. He\u2019s followed her footsteps and now spends all day locked in his bedroom playing video games. My son doesn\u2019t have an issue with our rules but my daughter is up in arms about it. She\u2019s angry with us for this decision even though she\u2019s usually complaining about the \u201cunfair\u201d treatment she gets compared to him. My husband and I have taken a step back and let her throw her temper tantrum but at this point it\u2019s been months and there\u2019s been minimal contact. I\u2019ve tried reaching out but she hasn\u2019t responded. I\u2019m scared she\u2019s going to cut me off again. So AITA\n\nEdit: because of the comments, I want to make clear that my son does not have any mental health issues, he became too far behind and the school dropped him for too many absences. \n\nBoth my son and her were given the same options of staying at home with a job or going to college. Since my daughter got some leeway with not having either and having time to do nothing, my son does as well. He does have a time frame to get it together or leave, just as my daughter did.\n\nI\u2019d like to add, since everyone thinks I\u2019m an awful parent, that my husband and I supported our daughter through her mental health crises. Years of suicide attempts and self harm. And we got her into therapy and into treatment and medication. She was given a lot more than our son was in terms of leniency.", "created_utc": 1676675998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1150pav/aita_for_giving_my_children_the_same_treatment/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't stick to a \"story\". I don't think you're a fit parent and I feel so sad for you kids.", "I\u2019m sorry you dealt with that, but I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve improved! Let\u2019s hope maybe one day OP will too \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Here\u2019s a fucking idea. If your child is HOMELESS, you let them come HOME. What the fuck is wrong with you?!", "The sad part here is that OP genuinely believes that the son has no mental health issues.", "And what happens when that obedient child becomes an adult? What type of adult do they become?\n\nObedience is only good when it\u2019s layered with other things. \n\nDoes you church believe in the head of house? People are supposed to be obedient towards the head of the household, but *in return* the head of house must only make decisions in the best interests of the household. \n\nHeads of households often forget that second part.\n\nParenting should be the same way. Children should be obedient and *in return* their parents should be using that obedience to teach them how to be independent, healthy, and productive adults.\n\nIf you are not teaching your children how to that then you have not done your duty as parents.", "Is it fuck", "You remind me a lot of my ex husband. Somehow I knew what your comments would look like before even reading one. No one here is going to convince you that your approach is wrong. I doubt you'll even accept the YTA votes. It's okay, your daughter seems to have gotten out and will hopefully have a good life. Hopefully your \"good child\" manages to overcome the completely lackadaisical parenting and make himself a good life. \n\nIt's freaking hilarious to me that you say an obedient child is a good child yet you \"had\" to kick out one kid for struggling with mental health and school and work and your other kid was kicked out of high school. How on the world is he \"obedient\" if he got kicked out of high school for not going/ doing the work? Did you not have ANY rules like, oh, I don't know \"you have to go to school\" or \"you have to do your homework\"?\n\nI'll try one last time to get through to you: you're going to lose your daughter completely with your actions. You're likely to lose your son completely as well, because he'll either mature and realize how much harder his life is because you completely failed him or he'll just combine being a failure and a disappointment. What are you going to do if he refuses to go to school or get a job? I'm going to guess nothing.", "Because you kicked her out bc she was glued to her phone. You don't seem to mind that he's glued to his video games.", "It told me and many other people more about yourself.", "Imagine if obedience wasn\u2019t the lens through how you viewed your daughter.\n\nYour daughter has a bold, curious personality. She\u2019s strong-willed, an unstoppable force. She perseveres through hardships. She doesn\u2019t let her history define her. \n\nThese are amazing traits. \n\nInstead of framing her identity around the type of child you wanted her to be, perhaps it\u2019s time to frame it around the women she\u2019s become.", "id have a bad temper towards you too. i hate you and i dont even know you. your comments are enough to know you are the asshole", "Yeah, and I think that's so important-- hands full with happy children. I love the way you put it-- \"Push the boundaries and dance all day.\" Perfect. Obedience is fine for young kids, so they learn through your rules not to push things in electric receptacles, run out into the street, magic marker on walls, etc., but I think when they're older, they need more autonomy to make decisions, perhaps fail, then learn persistence, and so on. They need to become who they're meant to be and not just be clones of their parents. I'm sorry you had a hard time, but it sounds like you learned a lot for your own kids.", "Oh don't I know that (genetics thing)\n\nAnd sounds like it is super common but it's easier to stick your head in the sand then actually do something good About it.", "My apologies, that I agree with", "They\u2019re children. Their rights are what we decide to give them as parents\n\nWithin reason of course. But your comment is insane", "She was 14 at the time of treatment. She left our home at 18. And we didn\u2019t know about the abuse", "Ok and then what? She gets to sleep all day and play on her phone? She gets to not contribute to society and eat the food and use the utilities we pay for? There\u2019s no sense in that. If we had let her stay she\u2019d be in the exact same spot. Us giving her the push she needed to leave was the best thing that\u2019s happened to her. She\u2019s now living on her own with a job. You obviously aren\u2019t a parent", "I\u2019ve suggested to him that we should get it checked out but he has resisted vehemently. He is very against all doctors and medications. The has seen a therapist and both he and the therapist have come back to say there\u2019s no mental health concerns out of the ordinary stress of being a teenager\n\nSo yeah, I believe my kid.", "We gave her time. She still didn\u2019t do anything. Now, my son is getting the same time she was.", "Yes that too. It\u2019s important to let kids push boundaries and not be obedient because they will learn what rules are ok to break or bend and which ones are actually crucial to follow. \n\nNot gonna lie tho, my youngest is definitely winning at figuring out ALL the boundaries lol. She\u2019s addictively delightful tho \ud83d\ude05\n\nThank you! It was watching other parents  (probably similar to yourself) that helped shape my ideals. \ud83e\udd1e here\u2019s to hopefully ending the trauma cycle for my kids.", " And this reply is exactly why everyone is calling you an asshole. Because you are. In this country we are born with inalienable rights.

Your children are adults and you\u2019re acting in a manner that would disappoint Jesus Christ.", "No you did know, she told you and you didn\u2019t believe her", "Oh yes. Making your daughter homeless is the \u2728best\u2728 thing that ever happened to her.\n\nYou have made your disdain for your daughters mental health abundantly clear. So I *would* say take her home and help her, and get her the help she needs, however I can already tell you couldn\u2019t bother yourself with such \u201ctedious problems\u201d. \n\nAnd let me tell you something lady. From the way you treat your daughter? You\u2019re not a fucking parent either.", "\u201cYou obviously aren\u2019t a parent\u201d\n\nUh\u2026your youngest son missed so much school for no apparent reason that you\u2019ve given that he was expelled from HIGH SCHOOL and your daughter was briefly homeless because you couldn\u2019t be bothered to help her. You may have kids but you aren\u2019t a parent either.", "Your level of denial is impressive...and scary.", "maybe hes against all doctors and medications because he has seen how you have treated your daughter when she was struggling and to seek help would be to admit that he isnt okay and for him not being okay = bad and being bad = becoming homeless \n\ngreat parenting! you literally have failed at the bare minimum level of emotional support. incredible", "It\u2019s hard to trust someone when they have a history of lying.", "I just can\u2019t win.
