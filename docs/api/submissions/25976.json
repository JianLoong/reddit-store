There's a big difference between \"other people are eating cake and I get a fruit cup\" versus \"other people are eating cake while I get *nothing* and just have to awkwardly, hungrily stare at an empty plate while everyone finishes.\"\n\nAnd, if your MIL just honestly screwed up but was determined to do better next time, that would be one thing. But she doubled down when your husband tried to explain it to her, and now may make things \"difficult\" if you dip out of these dinners for your own health and peace of mind.

Call him on this. You're building a child, at some detriment to your health. The VERY LEAST he can do is keep his mother from making your life worse. Actually, I think your husband is already TA.

So, until the baby is born and your health is back to normal, all foods will be in your home. \n\nSorry, but your husband should have your back and no longer go as well. \n\nShe is also showing that she cannot be trusted. What if the baby became diabetic or other health issues. She has shown that she will not provide a proper diet. I get it. I had my friends son over who was diabetic. Luckily, he was old enough, but everything I thought would be okay was so wrong. Learned a great lesson", "Pregnant hormonal and craving all sorts of bad food.

She has shown you that your baby's health is of no concern.   You can't trust her to follow even the simplest of instructions.  \n\nI'm sorry, but keeping your baby safe going forward will be very challenging if your husband doesn't step up and be a husband and father.  He's already asking you to compromise on your baby's health to assuage his mother's fragile ego.\n\nHe had a choice to make, and he chose his mother. This means you can't really trust him. The only way to trust him if you divorce is if he get s supervised visits only.  If you stay together he will acquiesce to your mom when you're not present.\n\nI know this seems alarmist, but no action is independent. Every action is shaped by prior actions and is an indicator of future actions.  Every action expresses perspective and intention.  Your husband's perspective views his mother above you. His intention is to keep the peace and placate his mother.  I wish and your child luck.", "NTA. The issue here is that MIL lied to you. She told you not to worry about it. \n\nI agree with her opinion that others don\u2019t need to refrain, but she literally told you not to worry.

She could have taken you up on your offer to bring your own meal or made something suitable. She was nasty on purpose and the fact your husband didn\u2019t call her out on it means she got away with it.  \n\nIf she\u2019s willing to douse everything in sugar when you have diabetes then she can\u2019t be trusted to ever do what\u2019s in your baby\u2019s best interest. \n\nI have a daughter in law and I would either ask her or my son what food she needs or look it up and cook special food for her if it didn\u2019t match what everyone else was eating.

Yes, your MIL should have provided more food options for you, but it\u2019s unreasonable for you to request that no one else eat sugary things around you. You can request that your husband not eat them, and to not keep sugary foods in your own home, but it\u2019s not fair to request that of everyone else. If being around sugar without eating any yourself for a few hours is that unbearable for you, then maybe you have a bigger problem you need to address.\n\nAfter all the AITA posts I\u2019ve seen where a former alcoholic was branded TA because they didn\u2019t want any alcohol at an event where they are the guest and not the host, this is basically the same thing but with sugar in place of the word alcohol.", "NTA.\n\nMIL's comment about moderation?

It was horrible to watch her go through that kind of pressure and tension - having family that didn\u2019t give two shits about supporting her would\u2019ve made the process nightmarish. \n\nYour MIL cooks to her tastes: fine. You don\u2019t need to be there. She can deal with your absence while you work through a medical complication to your pregnancy. And your husband should be your ADVOCATE, not your MIL\u2019s enabler with this.\n\nBest of luck with your pregnancy, and wishing you a safe delivery.", "YTA. You need to bring your own food, and you are wrong to expect others to abstain from sugar around you. That\u2019s unrealistic. Hormones are hard, and GD hard, so I understand your meltdown after, but hopefully you have a clearer mind once you cool down. You can decide to stop going if you want, DH should still go if he wants. This might hurt your in laws. It\u2019s your choice to make. It\u2019s more reasonable to just bring your own meals/snacks though. \n\nI had GD last pregnancy. It was horrible and I was miserable. But that wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault (mine included). It was my responsibility to manage myself. I adapted and brought my own meals and snacks. It\u2019s actually a little easier that way because you truly know and can control your sugar/carbs. I had to keep a meal diary along with my glucose readings, and if I prepared the food myself I knew I was being accurate. \n\nAlso worth mentioning that a lot of people don\u2019t understand GD or diabetes in general, and assume it\u2019s no big deal. Which is annoying, but all you can do is try to educate them. Honestly some people with GD don\u2019t take it seriously though. My in laws were all like that. So and so had GD and had zero issues, so why was I so strict? Or another person had type 2 diabetes and their numbers didn\u2019t have to be as controlled as mine. GD is different, as you know. You kind have to tune everyone else out and just handle yourself.\n\nGood luck with this pregnancy. There are a couple of good Facebook groups for people with GD that are supportive and also contain meal ideas.", "ESH. You for expecting others to refrain from eating sugary foods in front of you. MIL for not making at least *one* dessert without a bunch of added sugar. She could have used a non-sugar sweetener like Splenda on the strawberries, for instance. It also isn't that hard to make something for dinner that won't send a diabetic's blood sugar soaring (I should know since I'm type 2 diabetic myself).\n\nAs for getting upset because they ate things you couldn't have in front of you. Boo hoo. I wasn't diabetic as a child, but I was allergic to chocolate as a very young child (cleared at age 7) and eggs until my mid teens. \n\nIt would have been ridiculous to tell my classmates not to bring in cupcakes for birthdays because I couldn't have one. Ditto saying all the snacks at Girl Scout meetings had to be sans eggs or all the food at a church or family potluck. \n\nAnd my folks sure as hell weren't telling my siblings or anyone else they couldn't have chocolate! I may have been very young, but I remember getting other kinds of candy. I knew I couldn't have chocolate, so I didn't. When the allergy test came back negative, we stopped at a store right after & I had my very first chocolate bar. Obviously an important event! \n\nSame with the eggs. I learned how to read a label early, including all the terms for egg products like albumen. I knew most cookies and cakes were off-limits, I knew to ask about anything unfamiliar. \n\nIf someone tried to refuse something because they knew I couldn't have any, I protested that my allergy didn't mean they couldn't indulge. Sure, I was glad when that one also went away, but I don't recall ever being upset that someone ate chocolate or cake or whatever in front of me. \n\nIf I could handle that at less than 7 years old, you can bloody well handle it now.", "INFO but what was the actual main course you couldn't eat?  Obviously normal desserts are off the menu while you're diabetic, it's not a bug deal to skip them (I do)  and that's the only thing you're complaining about.", "No, everyone else does not need to refrain from eating what they like because you can't have it. What did she serve as the main dish? You said you ate salad and vegetables, but there's no mention of what else she made.   \nShe may not understand what your dietary restrictions/allowances are. The recommendations have changed over the years, and if she doesn't know anyone with diabetes she won't know. My stepfather is diabetic, and I am constantly reminding him and my mother things he shouldn't be having and what better options are.   \nMaybe have a conversation with her (or yes, bring your own meal) and explain the way you need to eat for the health of you and her grandbaby. Or yes, invite them to your house instead, and serve food that you can.  \nNAH.", "ESH. They suck for not providing you with food that you could actually eat. That would have been really hard and was really poor manners on their part. You suck for expecting everyone else to change their diets to accommodate you. I had GD, so I understand the limitations you had, but it's just not fair to force that on everyone else you have dinner with.", "Very soft NAH..\n\nAs someone who had GDM 3x (with 2x prems because of it) I completely get the risk and wanting to be safe for your baby.  Personally I would have cried too at only been able to eat a salad, she doesn\u2019t understand the diet at all. \n\nHowever I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to not allow others to eat surgery food in front of you. When I was in this situation I would bring my own food and a safe desert I could eat (my favourite was cheesecake made with cream cheese and sugar free jelly for the fillings and sugar free/low carb biscuits crushed for the base). It hit the spot", "NAH primarily because I can't find evidence in your post that MIL is deliberately serving food you can't eat - BBQ on chicken may not have registered for her mentally as a sugar bomb (it often doesn't) and/or she may have assumed that the sugar in the sauce was well balanced by the protein in the chicken. Assuming she thought she was serving a meal you could eat, making a dessert you couldn't isn't a high crime. (My opinion would change if there was some clear signal that this was weaponized incompetence.)\n\nThat said, between hormones and navigating a diabetic diet, I can completely understand not wanting to be present for meals. Hosting some meals at your home where you can manage the menu sounds like a solid plan (and if she shows up with cake you can have your NTA.)", "Well, NTA for not wanting to attend there, and also just a salad isn\u2019t really a good diner. However in your post you make it sound like there can\u2019t be any sugar at all at diner, which is like a vegan going to a house with meat and saying they can\u2019t eat meat. It\u2019s fine if you want to host to not serve any sugar. Overall NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And these are not some random people - it\u2019s her family who not only should be supporting her in this bump in the road,  they also are going to be grandparents to the child she is carrying. \n\nPlus, it doesn\u2019t sound like they gave her alternatives, so basically they didn\u2019t bother to cook her a proper meal and were OK with her just eating salad and veggies.", ">After all the AITA posts I\u2019ve seen where a former alcoholic was branded TA because they didn\u2019t want any alcohol at an event where they are the guest and not the host, this is basically the same thing but with sugar in place of the word alcohol.\n\nI don't agree with this comparison. This was a family dinner, not a full scale \"event\" like a wedding. And I think if you had a family member who was **newly** getting sober and had just started AA, you could be expected to not host a dinner and plunk down a giant pitcher of margaritas for everyone to enjoy right in front of them. Likewise, OP has had a diet change forced upon her a relatively short period of time ago and is still adjusting. Call me crazy, but I'm inclined to think that if you give a shit about your family members you can temporarily adjust dinners while they acclimate to their new normal.\n\nAnd no, you're not *obligated* to do that. But you have to accept that in return, your guests aren't *obligated* to come to your house for visits, and may well choose not to if they're not comfortable being tempted by what you serve them.", "It's really not.  A more apt comparison would be inviting the recovering alcoholic over,  telling them that they can't bring their own drinks,  and then providing only a pitcher of margaritas as a beverage. It's the fact that she was serving the sugary things in front of her, and ONLY the sugary things.", "No protein that I could eat safely - chicken was covered in BBQ sauce.  Just added a little Italian dressing to my veggies. Went straight home and ate.", "You\u2019re right about type 2/permanent. I forgot the specific statistic but I think it\u2019s like 50% of women with GD develop type 2 within a couple of years. You\u2019re also more likely to get it with each following pregnancy. It sucks.", "Except that the MIL told her not to bring her own food, and the adjustments for MIL to have provided something for her,  which she had said she was going to do,  would have been small and no real extra effort.  Leave a piece of chicken plain instead of covered in BBQ sauce. Leave a serving of strawberries plain. Easy. Her MIL chose not to accommodate.", "From the sounds of it, she wouldn't have been nearly as upset about the others having the sugary stuff if an alternative had been provided. Yeah,  she got a little emotional, but consider: she had been told that she would be accommodated for, and then arrived to a meal she could barely eat, while everyone else indulged in front of her.  Plus she was going home hangry and hormonal as hell. And the accommodations her MIL would have had to make were tiny and next to no effort.  Leave one piece of chicken plain. Leave one serving of strawberries plain. Not difficult.", "She responded in another comment, the main was chicken that was entirely covered in BBQ sauce.", "In the comments,  she stated that the main dish was chicken completely covered in BBQ sauce. Additionally, she had offered to provide for herself and was told not to.", "It was BBQ chicken, and all of the chicken was already covered in the sauce.  She said as much in a comment", "The thing for me is, and maybe this is because \\~Southern and as a child I literally went to summer cooking camps that culminated in the campers serving their parents a three-course meal, a host refusing to provide food alternatives, especially for her pregnant DIL, is insanely rude and thoughtless to me. Hosts need to accommodate their guests' dietary restrictions by having options.", "Totally agree with you. I was honestly starving when I left. Chicken with the sauce on the side or strawberries without the sugar. I even offered to bring a dish. Ugh!!!", "I found out I had GD right before thanksgiving so I had to go through thanksgiving and Christmas with cutting out sweets. Do you think I told my family to not have their Christmas treats? Of course not, that would be crazy and rude. It is also rude however to not have enough things that a pregnant woman can make a meal out of.", "as a diabetic this is nuts... just because I can't have sugar doesn't mean nobody should eat it in front of me... and I love sweets! That's just such an entitled take though and so selfish. why would I want other people to be deprived because I can't have something?\n\nop is nta... she's pregnant, hormonal, and learning to deal with this\n\n\nthis take in general is what I'm speaking to", "Yes, hubby is totally not on the same diet as I am. But other than this, he's been great about not eating desserts in front of me.  He switched to low carb fruits in support. Until now, we haven't had any issues with my GD.\n\nAnd hormones definitely don't help!", "Just curious really.", "Thank you for understanding.  This is new to me and the main point is supporting my baby. If I had more of a meal, I probably wouldn't have been as upset.  Im sure my hormones don't help and I definitely won't make a fuss at larger events.  But this was dinner for 4...I just thought she could be more supportive.\n\nAnd yes, strawberries without sugar would have been perfect!", "Expecting others to only eat what you can eat is unreasonable & \"crying the whole way home\" seems like an over-reaction.  While navigating GD may be new & upsetting, it sounds like you need to get some control over your feelings and take responsibility for your food intake.  If there was no specific discussion beforehand about what foods were \"safe,\" I think it would have been prudent to check the menu with MIL or take something you knew you could eat.", ">a host refusing to provide food alternatives, especially for her pregnant DIL, is insanely rude and thoughtless to me. Hosts need to accommodate their guests' dietary restrictions by having options.\n\nThis is what normal humans in the real world who give a shit about their family members/guests do. I grew up with a family member who had a list of dietary restrictions a mile long. She ALWAYS had her safe foods at every gathering and we ALWAYS made sure dessert included treats she liked and could eat. It's not hard.", "Not sure what she typically makes but almost sounds like sugar was added especially as there\u2019d been a conversation about what could and couldn\u2019t have", "Gestational diabetes is not fun. You have my empathy. \n\nI\u2019ve been there. It can be such a struggle to keep blood sugar under control on diet alone.\n\nLike you say, some small accommodations like setting the plain chicken aside, setting some plain strawberries aside are not huge inconveniences. \n\nI wonder if MIL might not fully appreciate the problem?", "Why offer? Just bring your own desserts. You're making this harder than it needs to be, OP, stop whining.", "I am a T1 diabetic, and as a small child, it was merciless. I've been T1 for over 30 years, which means that I've been T1 since *before short acting insulin existed.*\n\n\n\nWhich means a lot of my diet had to be controlled as a small child.\n\n\n\nI was *FORBIDDEN* any and all sugary treats! *EVER!* I wasn't allowed cake on MY birthday! Or Halloween candy! Or Christmas Candy! I was forbidden from having *snack time* at recess *in school!*\n\n\n\nAll of this while being surrounded by peers who delighted in the festivities. And some of them...some of them delighted in rubbing the festivities in my face. Because I was *not allowed.*\n\n\n\nIt all culminated in some Mother. Fucking. TRAUMA.\n\n\n\nAnd now I am simply *not to be TRUSTED* around a single piece of candy.\n\n\n\nSometimes when we are being *forced* to abstain, and it's NOT something like \"I really want to lose three pounds!!!\" It is NOT ok to watch other people partake.\n\n\n\nAnd it is PERFECTLY VALID for OP to draw the line, and remove HERSELF from the situation. To say \"no, that hurts my feelings, and I feel too vulnerable right now to endure that, I'm going to avoid that situation until I am less vulnerable.\" (After birth).\n\n\n\nShe's not doing anything *to* MIL. She's taking *herself* out of a situation. Which she is *Always* entitled to do, for any -or no- reason at all.\n\n\nNTA.", "As someone who has to tell expecting mothers the consequences of gestational diabetes taking a bad turn, please take every precaution possible. If you have to avoid/block/ go low contact with people, do it. It's not worth the health problems that it could cause both you and your unborn child for the rest of your life/their entire life. Avoid temptations even if others think you are overreacting. \n\nIt's better to overreact and keep yourselves healthy than to become careless and live with regret. \n\nI hope your pregnancy turns out well.", "The problem is that nearly all of what was served was what she couldn't eat.  If they'd all had the bbq, but MIL had set aside a portion without the sauce. It would have been fine.  Same with the strawberries. It's not the having things she couldn't,  it's that MIL didn't provide things she could have,  and refused her providing for herself."]}
