There's a big difference between \"other people are eating cake and I get a fruit cup\" versus \"other people are eating cake while I get *nothing* and just have to awkwardly, hungrily stare at an empty plate while everyone finishes.\"\n\nAnd, if your MIL just honestly screwed up but was determined to do better next time, that would be one thing.

So, until the baby is born and your health is back to normal, all foods will be in your home. \n\nSorry, but your husband should have your back and no longer go as well. \n\nShe is also showing that she cannot be trusted.

She has shown you that your baby's health is of no concern.   You can't trust her to follow even the simplest of instructions.  \n\nI'm sorry, but keeping your baby safe going forward will be very challenging if your husband doesn't step up and be a husband and father.  He's already asking you to compromise on your baby's health to assuage his mother's fragile ego.\n\nHe had a choice to make, and he chose his mother. This means you can't really trust him. The only way to trust him if you divorce is if he get s supervised visits only.  If you stay together he will acquiesce to your mom when you're not present.\n\nI know this seems alarmist, but no action is independent. Every action is shaped by prior actions and is an indicator of future actions.  Every action expresses perspective and intention.  Your husband's perspective views his mother above you. His intention is to keep the peace and placate his mother.  I wish and your child luck.", "NTA. The issue here is that MIL lied to you. She told you not to worry about it. \n\nI agree with her opinion that others don\u2019t need to refrain, but she literally told you not to worry.

If being around sugar without eating any yourself for a few hours is that unbearable for you, then maybe you have a bigger problem you need to address.\n\nAfter all the AITA posts I\u2019ve seen where a former alcoholic was branded TA because they didn\u2019t want any alcohol at an event where they are the guest and not the host, this is basically the same thing but with sugar in place of the word alcohol.", "NTA.\n\nMIL's comment about moderation?

You for expecting others to refrain from eating sugary foods in front of you. MIL for not making at least *one* dessert without a bunch of added sugar. She could have used a non-sugar sweetener like Splenda on the strawberries, for instance. It also isn't that hard to make something for dinner that won't send a diabetic's blood sugar soaring (I should know since I'm type 2 diabetic myself).\n\nAs for getting upset because they ate things you couldn't have in front of you. Boo hoo. I wasn't diabetic as a child, but I was allergic to chocolate as a very young child (cleared at age 7) and eggs until my mid teens. \n\nIt would have been ridiculous to tell my classmates not to bring in cupcakes for birthdays because I couldn't have one. Ditto saying all the snacks at Girl Scout meetings had to be sans eggs or all the food at a church or family potluck. \n\nAnd my folks sure as hell weren't telling my siblings or anyone else they couldn't have chocolate! I may have been very young, but I remember getting other kinds of candy. I knew I couldn't have chocolate, so I didn't. When the allergy test came back negative, we stopped at a store right after & I had my very first chocolate bar. Obviously an important event! \n\nSame with the eggs. I learned how to read a label early, including all the terms for egg products like albumen. I knew most cookies and cakes were off-limits, I knew to ask about anything unfamiliar. \n\nIf someone tried to refuse something because they knew I couldn't have any, I protested that my allergy didn't mean they couldn't indulge. Sure, I was glad when that one also went away, but I don't recall ever being upset that someone ate chocolate or cake or whatever in front of me. \n\nIf I could handle that at less than 7 years old, you can bloody well handle it now.", "INFO but what was the actual main course you couldn't eat?  Obviously normal desserts are off the menu while you're diabetic, it's not a bug deal to skip them (I do)  and that's the only thing you're complaining about.", "No, everyone else does not need to refrain from eating what they like because you can't have it. What did she serve as the main dish? You said you ate salad and vegetables, but there's no mention of what else she made.   \nShe may not understand what your dietary restrictions/allowances are. The recommendations have changed over the years, and if she doesn't know anyone with diabetes she won't know. My stepfather is diabetic, and I am constantly reminding him and my mother things he shouldn't be having and what better options are.   \nMaybe have a conversation with her (or yes, bring your own meal) and explain the way you need to eat for the health of you and her grandbaby. Or yes, invite them to your house instead, and serve food that you can.  \nNAH.", "ESH. They suck for not providing you with food that you could actually eat. That would have been really hard and was really poor manners on their part. You suck for expecting everyone else to change their diets to accommodate you. I had GD, so I understand the limitations you had, but it's just not fair to force that on everyone else you have dinner with.", "Very soft NAH..\n\nAs someone who had GDM 3x (with 2x prems because of it) I completely get the risk and wanting to be safe for your baby.  Personally I would have cried too at only been able to eat a salad, she doesn\u2019t understand the diet at all. \n\nHowever I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to not allow others to eat surgery food in front of you. When I was in this situation I would bring my own food and a safe desert I could eat (my favourite was cheesecake made with cream cheese and sugar free jelly for the fillings and sugar free/low carb biscuits crushed for the base). It hit the spot", "NAH primarily because I can't find evidence in your post that MIL is deliberately serving food you can't eat - BBQ on chicken may not have registered for her mentally as a sugar bomb (it often doesn't) and/or she may have assumed that the sugar in the sauce was well balanced by the protein in the chicken. Assuming she thought she was serving a meal you could eat, making a dessert you couldn't isn't a high crime. (My opinion would change if there was some clear signal that this was weaponized incompetence.)\n\nThat said, between hormones and navigating a diabetic diet, I can completely understand not wanting to be present for meals. Hosting some meals at your home where you can manage the menu sounds like a solid plan (and if she shows up with cake you can have your NTA.)", "Well, NTA for not wanting to attend there, and also just a salad isn\u2019t really a good diner. However in your post you make it sound like there can\u2019t be any sugar at all at diner, which is like a vegan going to a house with meat and saying they can\u2019t eat meat.
