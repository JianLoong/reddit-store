So, until the baby is born and your health is back to normal, all foods will be in your home. \n\nSorry, but your husband should have your back and no longer go as well. \n\nShe is also showing that she cannot be trusted.

She has shown you that your baby's health is of no concern.   You can't trust her to follow even the simplest of instructions.  \n\nI'm sorry, but keeping your baby safe going forward will be very challenging if your husband doesn't step up and be a husband and father.  He's already asking you to compromise on your baby's health to assuage his mother's fragile ego.\n\nHe had a choice to make, and he chose his mother. This means you can't really trust him. The only way to trust him if you divorce is if he get s supervised visits only.  If you stay together he will acquiesce to your mom when you're not present.\n\nI know this seems alarmist, but no action is independent. Every action is shaped by prior actions and is an indicator of future actions.  Every action expresses perspective and intention.  Your husband's perspective views his mother above you.

She told you not to worry about it. \n\nI agree with her opinion that others don\u2019t need to refrain, but she literally told you not to worry.

If being around sugar without eating any yourself for a few hours is that unbearable for you, then maybe you have a bigger problem you need to address.\n\nAfter all the AITA posts I\u2019ve seen where a former alcoholic was branded TA because they didn\u2019t want any alcohol at an event where they are the guest and not the host, this is basically the same thing but with sugar in place of the word alcohol.", "NTA.\n\nMIL's comment about moderation?

You for expecting others to refrain from eating sugary foods in front of you. MIL for not making at least *one* dessert without a bunch of added sugar. She could have used a non-sugar sweetener like Splenda on the strawberries, for instance. It also isn't that hard to make something for dinner that won't send a diabetic's blood sugar soaring (I should know since I'm type 2 diabetic myself).\n\nAs for getting upset because they ate things you couldn't have in front of you. Boo hoo. I wasn't diabetic as a child, but I was allergic to chocolate as a very young child (cleared at age 7) and eggs until my mid teens. \n\nIt would have been ridiculous to tell my classmates not to bring in cupcakes for birthdays because I couldn't have one. Ditto saying all the snacks at Girl Scout meetings had to be sans eggs or all the food at a church or family potluck. \n\nAnd my folks sure as hell weren't telling my siblings or anyone else they couldn't have chocolate! I may have been very young, but I remember getting other kinds of candy. I knew I couldn't have chocolate, so I didn't. When the allergy test came back negative, we stopped at a store right after & I had my very first chocolate bar. Obviously an important event! \n\nSame with the eggs. I learned how to read a label early, including all the terms for egg products like albumen. I knew most cookies and cakes were off-limits, I knew to ask about anything unfamiliar. \n\nIf someone tried to refuse something because they knew I couldn't have any, I protested that my allergy didn't mean they couldn't indulge. Sure, I was glad when that one also went away, but I don't recall ever being upset that someone ate chocolate or cake or whatever in front of me. \n\nIf I could handle that at less than 7 years old, you can bloody well handle it now.", "INFO but what was the actual main course you couldn't eat?  Obviously normal desserts are off the menu while you're diabetic, it's not a bug deal to skip them (I do)  and that's the only thing you're complaining about.", "No, everyone else does not need to refrain from eating what they like because you can't have it. What did she serve as the main dish? You said you ate salad and vegetables, but there's no mention of what else she made.   \nShe may not understand what your dietary restrictions/allowances are. The recommendations have changed over the years, and if she doesn't know anyone with diabetes she won't know. My stepfather is diabetic, and I am constantly reminding him and my mother things he shouldn't be having and what better options are.   \nMaybe have a conversation with her (or yes, bring your own meal) and explain the way you need to eat for the health of you and her grandbaby. Or yes, invite them to your house instead, and serve food that you can.  \nNAH.", "ESH. They suck for not providing you with food that you could actually eat. That would have been really hard and was really poor manners on their part. You suck for expecting everyone else to change their diets to accommodate you. I had GD, so I understand the limitations you had, but it's just not fair to force that on everyone else you have dinner with.", "Very soft NAH..\n\nAs someone who had GDM 3x (with 2x prems because of it) I completely get the risk and wanting to be safe for your baby.  Personally I would have cried too at only been able to eat a salad, she doesn\u2019t understand the diet at all. \n\nHowever I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to not allow others to eat surgery food in front of you. When I was in this situation I would bring my own food and a safe desert I could eat (my favourite was cheesecake made with cream cheese and sugar free jelly for the fillings and sugar free/low carb biscuits crushed for the base). It hit the spot", "NAH primarily because I can't find evidence in your post that MIL is deliberately serving food you can't eat - BBQ on chicken may not have registered for her mentally as a sugar bomb (it often doesn't) and/or she may have assumed that the sugar in the sauce was well balanced by the protein in the chicken. Assuming she thought she was serving a meal you could eat, making a dessert you couldn't isn't a high crime. (My opinion would change if there was some clear signal that this was weaponized incompetence.)\n\nThat said, between hormones and navigating a diabetic diet, I can completely understand not wanting to be present for meals. Hosting some meals at your home where you can manage the menu sounds like a solid plan (and if she shows up with cake you can have your NTA.)", "Well, NTA for not wanting to attend there, and also just a salad isn\u2019t really a good diner. However in your post you make it sound like there can\u2019t be any sugar at all at diner, which is like a vegan going to a house with meat and saying they can\u2019t eat meat.

Not so much \u201cyou have to change and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re a bad person / don\u2019t care about me\u201d, but more so an \u201cI\u2019ll eat before I go, or after, or bring something anyhow, or have conversations that are curious and perhaps educational without being hostile or presuming malice where there\u2019s typically just ignorance or a need for more information\u201d\u2026 \n\nAnd yeah, absolutely ok for OP to not want to do any of that!!! 100% her choice, and maybe her in-laws are crap in other ways that might lend this specific situation credibility as them being controlling, disrespectful a-holes\u2026 only OP knows that. But on the chance they are overall pretty decent, and capable of adapting / being flexible given a little time / communication, then it\u2019s likely the relationship is valuable enough to put in a little effort at being flexible herself, too. \n\nPS- I may be off base bit if I remember correctly, strawberries were a no-no during GD with or without sugar. At least they were for me. Not that it matters really in the bigger context, but I never presumed I\u2019d have dessert in any form anywhere while wrangling the inconvenience/ frustration of GD. Thank goodness it was temporary, as I know for some it\u2019s not!", "Yeah. I'm married to a T1 diabetic and struggling to fond sympathy here because it's a few months. Plus if she is trying to cut all sugars, clearly the strawberries would be a no go in general.", "Serious question, how would that help her prevent a sharp increase in blood sugar? It can take an hour or two to spike after a meal and if you\u2019re newly diagnosed you aren\u2019t going to know how your body responds to a certain amount of sugar just yet. From my understanding if chicken is covered in barbecue sauce and you\u2019re not taking insulin you wouldn\u2019t be able to predict how much you\u2019d spike or do anything to adjust once you did", "\ud83d\ude44 She could have eaten the inside of that chicken but she would rather sob the whole way home \ud83d\ude44", "Username checks out.\n\nMIL made sure the only things OP could eat were a side salad and some veggies. If you know anything about diabetes, you know diabetics also have to watch veggie intake because some of them actually have a high natural sugars content.\n\nOP didn\u2019t get a protein because MIL doused it all with a sauce that she couldn\u2019t eat. Let\u2019s review: a pregnant woman who\u2019s blood volume is increasing and who\u2019s body is supporting two lives needs a substantial amount of protein (and iron) *daily* to support that growth. Making the pregnant woman go without protein/iron for literally no reason other than a stubborn refusal to listen is unacceptable.\n\nOP was left starving because MIL couldn\u2019t be bothered to keep a portion of meat on the side that could be served with no sauce. It\u2019s mind-boggling that this should be an issue, it would\u2019ve been so easy to accommodate on the protein. And on the strawberries! Just set a few aside. But MIL refused to do that and dumped sugar over everything. She clearly doesn\u2019t believe or care that OP has a critical dietary restriction. She sounds like one of those people who\u2019d subtly feed PB to a kid with peanut allergies because that allergy just must be totally overblown and nothing bad will ever happen.", "This reminds me of how my uncle describes my moms family. And her family was always difficult. It just means his was WORSE.", "My friend has celiac. The first year after diagnosis is particularly difficult. She got choked up the first time she came over for dinner because her own family did not make gluten free meals for her. I always lay out a gluten free spread at parties because she is my guest and I want her to feel like a normal person free to graze like everyone else without fear.", "Dream on, MIL!", "She could eat the sauce, but if it had a lot of sugar in it(which most do) it could cause a reaction. Don\u2019t downplay it because you think it\u2019s weird. The OP is trying to do the best she can.", "We don't know what was in the sauce. If there was flour or sugar in it, she could have spiked for not accounting for it. Gestational Diabetes is very tricky. Also, a diabetics person would likely have insulin at their disposal when needed, that's not the case with GD when you're diet-controlled.", "I'm super curious about the thought process behind correcting someone's language. Do you think they don't know that teached is non standard? It's reddit, it's informal, it's not a PhD dissertation.", "No they wouldn't. I got torn apart for complaining that at a family dinner, there was not one option for me as a vegetarian. Not one. They even got meat in the salad. And reddit came down on me, that I should have spoken up, I should hand brought my own food, no one needs to \"cater\" to me, etc. They're only on OPs side because she's pregnant. No one sticks up for vegetarians on reddit, no one; try again.", "No. She had a salad and veggies. She wouldn't eat the chicken (not entirely sure why) and dessert. That is not 80% of the meal.", "That why she should have a glucose monitor. So she will know how certain foods will affect her.", "Left starving?? Lol sure. \nI'm not saying mil was right. That's not the question. \n\nThe question was ... Would she be a brat for refusing to go to her husband's family house once every few weeks for dinner. That is the question. The answer is yes. \n\nSpin the drama any way you want but bottom line is this pregnant woman had one small meal and lost her sh!t. And therefore wants to cut off all family meals at her husband's parents house. \nSure. \n\nThe drama drama drama you post about needing to feed a baby protein and vitamins and this add that ..blah blah blah. That's literally what every other meal of the month does for her. This was one meal. One freaking meal. Lol seriously comical.\n\nIf only there was a way our body could feed itself from stored calories for all of 3 hours while she was at their house. She went home and ate a meal and the night was over and baby is fine. If she was that starved or truly seriously concerned about her blood sugar levels then she should have gone into the fridge or pantry at mil's and eaten something. Like any person would with a medical concern. Instead she did nothing and cried. \n\nThere's an easy solution without drama but op is making more drama by not going to family dinners. Have fun with that. Next post she'll wonder why in-laws won't babysit. She's gonna need their help and support. Her behavior is short sighted and foolish.", "It is not at all clear that MIL understood OP\u2019s dietary needs.", "Yes", "This is why people don't like nurses. Shitty personalities. Of course she was crying. She was hungry and is pregnant and hormonal. Maybe act like you have the ability to show some compassion."]}
