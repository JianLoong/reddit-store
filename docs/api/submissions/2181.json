{"id": 2181, "submission_id": "ytojjd", "title": "AITA for calling my BIL fat?", "selftext": "I know, I know, the title makes me sound awful right off the bat, but please read the whole story before making a decision.\nSo, it is important to the story for me to include a few details: my husband is on the fuller side (he\u2019s got a dad bod and I love it) and my BIL has been having drama with the fam for the couple years since he got married. Also, I\u2019m 30 weeks pregnant.\nMy BIL and my husband used to be best friends growing up, he was best man at our wedding. When my husband and I got married, he (husband) was kind of on the skinny side. However, he\u2019s gained weight (as we all do as we grow) and now, he\u2019s fuller with a bit of a gut. Now, I actually love this. Any woman on here can tell you that it\u2019s much cozier cuddling, intercourse is better, etc. Also, it\u2019s so attractive. His little brother, however, has always been a little obsessed with his body image. He went to the gym a lot, did fad diets, the works. He got married under two years ago to a woman that no one in the family liked. She was pretty awful, but that\u2019s a very long and separate story. Basically, my husband refused to speak to his brother until they (he and his wife) apologized to my MIL and FIL for taking advantage of them and borrowing a lot of money without paying it back is the short story. However, my BIL\u2019s bday was last week, and my MIL really wanted him and his wife to come over to have dinner at their house. Surprisingly, my BIL said yes. Even more surprising, she also convinced my husband to also come over. \nSo, we go, and I won\u2019t lie, it was tense and awkward. But my husband was genuinely trying to remain civil, mostly by keeping conversations short. However, the subject then turned to exercising, healthy eating, stuff like that. My husbands sister started joking about how she wanted to get back in the gym, and my BIL looked at my husband and said, \u201cYou know, O, you should get in there too. You look even more pregnant than (me).\u201d I feel like I should make this known: Ever since he got married, my BIL has gained weight. Like, a lot of weight. He\u2019s not morbidly obese, but it\u2019s a pretty extreme contrast from before, when he was obsessed with his body image and biceps and whatever. My husbands family started joking that my husband did look a little overweight, but I could tell some of their comments were going a little far. So, I started trying to play it off by telling them things like, \u201cBut I love him like this! It\u2019s so hot to me!\u201d Or joking about us having a baby soon, or that he\u2019d never catch up with my pregnancy weight.  However, my BIL started really taking it too far. He said stuff like, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be too big to play with your kids soon.\u201d And, \u201cHow are you going to encourage your kids to be healthy if you aren\u2019t?\u201d At this point, I was fed up. I can read my husband better than anyone, and I knew the comments hurt. Now, my husband is a very mild-mannered, sweet guy with hardly a confrontational bone in his body. But I\u2019m the complete opposite, so I didn\u2019t feel guilty at all when I turned to BIL and said with a straight face, \u201cYou\u2019re really going to judge O on his weight when you look how you do? Pot and kettle and all that bullshit?\u201d Well, BIL\u2019s face immediately fell, and he started freaking out on me, insisting that it was different and that was so fucked up of me to say. Then, his wife jumped in and was screaming at me that \u201ca skinny white girl like me would never understand.\u201d (Husbands whole family and BIL\u2019s wife are Hispanic). At this point, my husband and I were done. We left. \nI really don\u2019t feel bad in the slightest, and my husband was laughing pretty hard about it, but my MIL is mad at us cause now BIL is pouting and ignoring everyone again, including her. Plus, I\u2019ve never really been plus-size so maybe I did take things a little too far, and I could have worded it better without insulting him.
