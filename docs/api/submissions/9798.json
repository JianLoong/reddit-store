The brother probably needs to talk to his wife and explain that this is not a slight and has been the interaction he has with his daughter.\n\nBlended families are complicated and considering the ages it should be possible to explain the situation to all parties involved.

She probably feels excluded and unwelcome.", "I don't see any problem with calling your niece your favorite niece. You two have a relationship and it's natural for you to call her that.

Talk to your favorite niece and explain why the change is necessary.\n\nDo you realize that you will probably be expected to treat both girls the same? Your SILs family should be expected to do the same. When you take your niece out for a meal or to the movies, you will be expected to take both.  Gifts will need to be equal. Some parents even expect that inheritance from family needs to be equal. It would be a good idea to navigate these issues before they become a problem.", "YTA. It would be pretty simple to tell your niece that you\u2019ve loved calling her your favorite, but now that you have two nieces you will stop because you want to make sure your whole family knows they\u2019re loved and accepted.

Instead you\u2019re showing her it\u2019s ok to keep inside jokes that hurt others because she was there first. \u201cOld boys club\u201d mentality.", "NTA at the moment, however, I have a suggestion that could be a good compromise. I have 1 bio son and 1 bio daughter. I used to say \"you're my favourite daughter\" because like you, I only had 1. I now have the most amazing bonus daughter also. So now I say \"you're my favourite 'insert name here' \".\n\nIt still gets the point across, no one feels excluded, you still have a special thing with your niece and it could help you build a  relationship with your bonus niece.\n\nBlending families is hard, there is every possibility the daughter feels left out and is fearful of rejection.

This bothered my kids, who didn't really remember much about the two littermates we had before her who were tied for Best Dog Ever.  My younger kid insisted that the \"Third\" in Sarah's title just meant she was the third one in temporal order -- not in \"worth\" -- in our family home. We are now on our Fourth Best Dog Ever.  And our first Best Cat.\n\nSo IF your relationship develops in a way that permits it, perhaps your new niece might become, temporally, your Second Favorite Niece.
