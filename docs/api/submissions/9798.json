Between us each of us has a favourite and they have their own favourites, and all of us KNOW but don\u2019t really care because they love each of us dearly, just some more than others.\n\nIf my uncle called me something all my life and stopped because my mum decided to marry someone with a daughter, I\u2019d be very hurt.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not the same. He\u2019s known one the entirety of her life and the other is practically a stranger. Marriage doesn\u2019t magically make someone family.", "He\u2019s called her his favourite niece since she was FOUR YEARS OLD. And frankly in my opinion, marriage doesn\u2019t magically make someone family. Same as blood doesn\u2019t automatically make you family.\n\nYou have to get to know someone before you can call them family.", "Yeah that sounds toxic. I get along best with my oldest niece per now but that doesn't mean she's my favorite.\n\nNo need to start a new relationship by making people feel left out and unwelcome though. Even if niece notice she isn't called favourite any longer, it won't harm her. She has her place. The step niece however is new and needs reassurance, not shut doors. The same goes for the other side of the family welcoming the niece. I'd be pissed if my SIL married another guy whose family made my nieces feel like unwelcome strangers from day one.", "How long has this new sil been a sil?  I was the step kid to family and even as a teen, hearing it was just yet another reminder of my outside status.  I understood it logically but my heart still hurt", "NTA", "NTA and are you actually hurting your new nieces feelings or are you hurting SILs feelings bc I'd imagine a 14 year old who barely knows you wouldn't think she's the favorite by any stretch. I'm sure she wouldn't say you're her favorite uncle either which isn't a dig at you but she doesn't know you lol", "I have three grand daughters and depending on their behaviour and how I feel they get turns at being favourite", "NTA\n\nI understand your feelings, but if you want a better relationship later in life, I wouldn't say it loud or in front of her. \n\nSIL can't decide how you should treat her daughter, but be careful, she can decide if you meet your niece or not. People are petty.\n\nJust talk with your SIL. She can't expect from you to change your ritual / relationship with your niece, but you could try to involve her daughter more. Explain to her, that if it affect her daughter mentally, you can make a compromise and maybe change something, but until than, she needs to wait.\nShe didn't married your brother after her first date. To become a family takes time.", "Nta you've known your niece since since was born ..keep your bond of calling her that.  Doubt her daughter is hurt I think your sister in law is for some odd reason", "NTA but u should avoid saying it in-front of the other niece.", "NTA", "Can step parent stop coming into a family and expecting the extended family to immediately, automatically feel the same amount of love for their child as they do for the kids they\u2019ve known from day 1?", "My nephew D (22) is my favorite oldest nephew and his brother J is my favorite youngest nephew. \n\nMy nieces are identical twins so I haven\u2019t come up with something for them yet.", "Sure it doesn\u2019t have to be, but she is also not obligated to do it considering she doesn\u2019t have a relationship with the girl.

It makes him feel good and it doesn\u2019t hurt anybody else\u2019s feelings because he\u2019s the only youngest nephew. You don\u2019t need to turn it into a book, OP, but it\u2019s also not hard to change it a little bit.", "One of them is older than the other, and if they're anything like the twins I've met, they know it and joke about it too. So you can probably have a favorite oldest and youngest niece here.", "Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. YTA. My MIL used to tell me that I was her favorite DIL (I was the only). When she got another DIL, we had to change the joke. You can still alter the joke and keep the same relationship.", "Who is also old enough to understand how this could be seen as unwelcoming to the new niece. This seems like a great opportunity to have a discussion with bio-niece about how it's important  not to seem like you're excluding new niece AND how your relationship with her is just as close and important as it's always been.\n\nBeing considerate of new niece takes nothing away from your relationship with bio-niece.", "I agree, but I have seen it a lot on reddit. You build a relationship with a relative over many years, and because someone in your family gets married, now you have to immediately treat the new additions as equal. You have no choice in the matter, if you refuse to do it, your family member can cut off all contact to the child in question.", "It\u2019s not toxic. All of us cousins love each other dearly, like we\u2019re siblings, and our uncles love everyone dearly like children as well. Any of us ever needs any of our uncles or aunts, they\u2019re always there for us. And all of us have our favourites.\n\nI will reiterate i personally do not believe marriage makes someone family automatically. You have to get to know someone before you can call them family, just like friends and every other relationship in life. Personal preferences I suppose.", "A little social niceties go a long way.\n\nI get it, she is a step child and new to a relationship with you. \n\nNow you try to get it, she\u2019s a nervous kid in a new environment catching signals of \u201cyou don\u2019t belong\u201d right off the bat.\n\nOf the two people involved, there\u2019s one I\u2019d expect to have a mature handle on the situation. It ain\u2019t the fourteen year old.\n\nNTA, I guess, but cut the kid a break, huh?", "YTA. family remarriage and rearrangement is really hard on kids and you\u2019re othering her. Regardless of whether or not she knows that you aren\u2019t as close that would still hurt to hear. Shes 14. Teens often struggle with low self esteem. Thats common knowledge. You\u2019re being insensitive.", "NTA-", "NTA", "NTA but maybe you could make it a silly joke. I have a daughter and two sons. I always told my daughter she was my favorite daughter. My sons I would say \u201cyou\u2019re my favorite 6 year old!\u201d or whatever age they were at the time because they\u2019ll always be 2 years apart. As they got older they got the joke and laugh about it to this day. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH because this child just came into your life and your niece has known you since birth.", "NTA. Assuming SIL was around before they were married she and BIL should have had conversations with relatives as preparation for joining the family. It\u2019s ridiculous for step kids to be married into a family without their parents paving the way. Having a step kid join the family doesn\u2019t automatically make everyone change the existing family dynamics or their feelings about bio family or step kids. The same holds true for the step kids.\n\nInstead of calling you an a hole, SIL and BIL should have conversations with everyone (including the step kids) about their family goals. Not every kid wants to adopt a whole new extended family they barely know and they\u2019re fine with keeping their own identity while welcoming step family as friends. Especially teenagers. Is it really the niece expressing this or is the SIL commenting on her unrealistic version of what she thinks the ideal family should be?\n\nFamilial bonds take time to develop. OP you should be considerate of the situation for sure. Sounds like SIL hasn\u2019t had specific conversations with you about her daughter\u2019s inclusion in your life or creating specific opportunities for you and her daughter to bond. If she hasn\u2019t, SIL and BIL are handling step nieces integration into the family very poorly.  Reddit is filled with kids who don\u2019t want to see step family the same as bio family. Step kids didn\u2019t fall in love, their parents did. It\u2019s time step kids get the voice they deserve.", "Ok but is it like that hurtful ? When someone has a favourite it\u2019s quite obvious. And the niece is also adjusting to the family dynamic as well , while OP isn\u2019t an AH for continuing to call his niece the favourite , now that he knows the other one gets hurt he should not do it in front of her . NTA", "NTA, I\u2019m actually wondering if it was more SIL who was upset and not actually the daughter because it really doesn\u2019t sound like a 14 year old.", " NTA. Clearly your blood related/loved since she was born niece will always have the closest bond/be your favorite niece. But now that you have a step niece, it would be better to not say that in front of her. She likely already knows that fact but it\u2019s not necessary to rub it in. However, the mom needs to realize your relationship with her daughter will never be the same as your blood niece.", "NTA. It's possible that the step niece doesn't care and it's just the SIL that's creating drama.", "NAH. It\u2019s normal that you have not bonded with the new niece yet. However, 14 years old is still very young and she has had a huge change in her family life. She might be anxious about whether or not she will be accepted. I would avoid calling your first niece \u201cfavourite niece\u201d in front of your new niece.", "Easy NTA, the girl is 14 and you hardly know her.\n\nYes, she's being dramatic.", "So the literal opposite of what op is saying", "They don\u2019t have to feel the same about both kids but they could at least refrain from publicly pronouncing it in front of the kid who probably feels like an outsider already", "that's the thing, she *is* calling *all* of her nieces her favorite. all of her nieces just doesn't include the new girl", "Why would she want a relationship with you?", "Exactly", "Yeah you should stop doing things when they start hurting people"]}
