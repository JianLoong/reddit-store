No where did you indicate that he feels as if his life sucks in general. It seems he has issues with the relationship he had with his parents. This is a universal need for all children regardless of wealth. For him that was a bad experience and you don't get to tell him it wasn't, even if your overall experience was worse.", "YTA And if you start the trauma olympics, except if you were abducted to be a child soldier in a wartorn country you are never allowed to complain about anything ever again... see how dumb it is ?", "YTA because this isn't a fricking competition.

Something that causes a trauma response in one person might not in another.\n\nI grew up in a working class family too. But if my family was richer and I was suddenly sent of to a boarding school... I think that'd be pretty traumatic. As a kid, I used to have regular nightmares about being taken away from my parents in various ways.

To be honest, I\u2019d be shocked if he stayed with you. You don\u2019t get to minimize the level of someone\u2019s trauma because they grew up wealthy.

Everyones childhood shit is their own and its no one's job to gatekeep trauma. Just because there was money involved doesn't mean the emotional impact was any softer for him. If you care about him I would apologise for this cause its gross.", "YTA. It doesn't matter if his trauma was better or worse than yours. Everyone has the worst periods of their lives, and his childhood could be that for him. \n\nGoing to a boarding school has a lot of potential to feel abandoned, isolated, and unloved. It's insensitive to judge certain struggles as unworthy of compassion just because it doesn't feel trauma worthy to you. It was trauma worthy to him, and you should be understanding and kind about it.", "YTA. you are invalidating his trauma because it is different from yours, but your specific types of issues are not the only ones that matter. You can acknowledge that someone had certain privileges that you did not without extrapolating that to mean they must have faced no issues at all. \n\nYou don't need to fully understand, sometimes that is impossible, but repeatedly telling someone you love that you don't see something they are telling you is a problem for them as a problem is not helpful at all. \n\nThe interesting thing is you don't seem to be asking if your actions lack empathy, instead you seem to be saying that you know they do you just think that's fine.

It sounds like you both had different experiences but pulling the 'I had it worse' card just isn't very helpful and not necessarily even true. \n\nI'd also take on board the fact that his Dad has since apologised on numerous occasions. It's unlikely he'd do that had he been just a little bit harsh. \n\nYou need to be more supportive.", "YTA. For the record, comparing childhoods and traumas is a big mistake. When you say that you think his life wasn't that horrible, you're invalidating his experience and suggesting yours is authentic but his is not. That isn't fair to him, because even though he grew up in a well off family doesn't mean he didn't have serious issues with his family and being sent to boarding school. \n\nI feel like if you want to be a good partner, you shouldn't be writing off his experiences as being less horrible than yours or for just not thinking they're serious enough to warrant him talking about them. You should try to be supportive when he talks about it, and allow him to vent as needed. If it really is an excessive issue and this is all he talks about, you should gently suggest he seek therapy to help him deal with the issues.", "YTA Comparing trauma is like comparing causes of death.

I wouldn\u2019t just dismiss your traumas because I likely was dealt a more difficult hand.\n\nI don\u2019t see that he\u2019s trying to say that he had it worse than you or is otherwise making comparisons.

Someone to help you to through these issues in perspective.", "YTA. There's lots of different kinds of abuse. They're all terrible things, but the kids of rich parents might have all the stuff they need, but none of the emotional warmth or connection that human beings need desperately growing up. It might seem difficult (I grew up in a family that didn't have much, and my wife was relatively well off but had a similar problem) but you can't go around comparing things if you're treating the person with respect. Their lived experience is theirs and you can't tell them something isn't traumatising if that was how they experienced it.", "YTA, you can't compare your experiences, its very shitty and invalidates every experience of your BF, just because he grew up rich and the boarding school has a good name his life as a child was perfect and wonderfull??? You lack empathy.", "Mild YTA, it's hard to be empathetic with someone who has had everything handed to them as someone who's worked for everything. It's easy for people to say YTA because you're creating trauma Olympics but being truly empathetic despite the privilege that you're deprived of is difficult and takes time.", "YTA, what gives you the right to sit in judgement of someone's elses, yes, even your BF's, trauma and tell them it isn't as bad as yours?", "YTA. You don't get to decide that because he had a lot of money and nice things growing up that he must've lived on Easy Street. Boarding schools exist primarily so that rich parents can have the bare minimum contact and responsibility for their children until they are of an acceptable age, temperament, and behavior that the parents can be seen in their social circles with the kid without dying of embarrassment. Some parents, rich or not, see their kids as status symbols that allow them to move freely within certain social circles, which means they're essentially using their kids for their own advancement.\n\nThere's this behavior that a lot of people do without realizing that it's harmful. It's called invidious comparison. Invidious means \"(of a comparison or distinction) unfairly discriminating; unjust.\n*\"it seems invidious to make special mention of one aspect of his work\"* Basically you've just done that by minimizing his childhood hardships and comparing his upbringing to yours.", "I dub thee life's victim.

You are one of the worst types of people - people who compare and belittle trauma. Guess what? Your opinion about what he feels was traumatic does not matter.

I really, really want to drag you for coming off like you have a monopoly on struggle, but instead I'm going to assume that what's -actually- bothering you is that your boyfriend is still benefiting from and in contact with people who, to hear him tell it, treated him badly and that it feels hypocritical in some way.\n\n\"How can he do that if they were so awful to him?

In the wide expanse of mental trauma though, there is a lot of grey area.

Honey, that's your envy speaking.", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t gatekeep trauma. \n\nWhat may not be a big deal to you, can be devastating to someone else.\n\nAlso, money doesn\u2019t buy you happiness, just because he\u2019s rich doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have things to worry about.", "YTA\n\n>It has become very frustrating when all he does is talk shit about his parents to me while not doing anything about it.\n\nSometimes people just need someone who will listen to them.  He doesn't need you to tell him \"what to do\".  He just wants to vent.  Do you love him?  Do you want him to feel accepted in the relationship?  Why can't you just be a sounding board for him when he needs one?\n\nI get that to someone who grew up poor, the problems of rich people may seem trivial.  But imagine the isolation of being banished from home when you were a child.  And having your father being \"strict\" (which probably means he wasn't very loving or kind) even before that.  To a child, that's a big deal.  And the trauma that we endure in childhood affects us long into adulthood.\n\nIf you can't have empathy for the fact that he has conflicted feelings for his parents, and that he's still dealing with issues stemming from his childhood...  I dunno.  If I were in a relationship, I'd want my partner to have empathy for me.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s fine for him to feel like he had issues during his childhood. You are not his therapist you are his girlfriend. He can work through those issues with them. He needs to understand a majority of people aren\u2019t going to look at his childhood and be sympathetic. He simply had more than 99% of people. I\u2019d bet part of his issue is guilt over the family money and privilege yet still being unhappy. \n\nThere are people saying trauma Olympics! Everyone\u2019s trauma is valid! But it really isn\u2019t that simple, every person has a right to feel how they want, but you can\u2019t expect everyone to be empathetic towards your feelings. Their own life experiences shape their view of the world. Your experiences make it hard to empathize with rich kid problems and that\u2019s also okay too. But y\u2019all both need to recognize that.", "You don\u2019t have to think someone\u2019s trauma is traumatic lol if you share, then those you share with have the right to an opinion of their own", "YTA. According to you YOU are not allowed to say anything about your bad childhood - you have not been raped, mutilated, not starving, not a child soldier, not living on a cent a day, not slowly dying of toxic waste to be able to live on a cent a day.\n\nFeelings and traumas are not comparable. Show some empathy and learn how to respond to other people's feelings.", "NTA \n\nYou may be experiencing emotional burnout if he's CONSTANTLY venting to you about his trauma. Therapy for ya both.", "Honestly my very wealthy step-uncle (aunts second husband) deeply fucked up his kids by sending them to boarding school from 10-18. How can that not be seen as a total abandonment of a kid? Especially if they dont want to leave, you kick them out as a child so you dont have to deal with them because it's for their own \"good\" and success? Also, two things can co-exist: he can still be hungry for his parents love and be traumatized about the way they raised him. Just because the school was prestigious and helped his career doesnt make it any better. You are within your rights to gently say listen I care about you but it's hard to hear your stories because it brings up my thoughts of my own childhood, which was very hard for different reasons, is there a way for you to find another outlet?", "YTA\n\nThere is no set way to measure a person's trauma...because it's personal! I had childhood trauma and never discuss it with my parents because, unlike your boyfriend's father, mine don't acknowledge anything wrong ever happened, so what is there to discuss!", "A child at boarding school knows that they have parents but that those parents have more important things to do than raise their children, don't have time for them and don't want them around.  It doesn't matter how much money your family has, that's going to hurt and is likely to leave a hole in the child's emotions.", "Yta it's not a contest", "Trauma is not a competition. People of all walks of life can have traumatic experiences, even rich people. YTA. Would you like it if you were taken from your parents and home and placed somewhere you didn\u2019t want to be?", "The fuck are you smoking?", "It doesn't sound like burnout though, OP is more like bf doesn't deserve to complain because he grew up rich", "Rich solves a majority of problems", "Yeah in reverse of that my friend got told she was lucky by someone who lost her husband after a year whilst friend lost husband after 20+ years because she got to spend more time with her husband. I get where the person was coming from that my friend got more time but both of them are grieving and I don't think trauma/grief should ever be compared because it's so personal and devastating no matter what."]}
