What an odd reaction! Before you make any big decisions, maybe talk with her about it?", "NTA. That's such a weird reaction. :S\n\nIf she's not *normally* an arsehole I'd ask her about it, see what the problem is. But that response doesn't bode well for her being a reasonable person the rest of the time. Up to you whether it's worth trying to talk about it or if it's better to just drop it and pick another name, but since your husband's already been using it for years as an artist name it might be worth a proper conversation. Good luck either way \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA Most people would be honoured that you took their last name especially mother's as most of the time their family name line ends with them if they have no siblings.", "NTA, but her reaction is so weird. Do you and her have a strained relationship? Is she very traditional there must be some reason for iw.cam your husband talk to her and ask what's up?", "INFO do you anything about your MIL relationship with her father? \n\nIf it seems like she doesn't want you to take it it could be a lovely idea to create your own name together.", "I think it\u2019s a beautiful tribute to yourselves to pick a new last name. If the MIL feels disrespected by you all choosing her last name, choose another name. I have a step-son who disowned us years back, and while both sides are happy with his decision, it makes perfect sense for him to change his last name, as the familia relationship is not present anymore. NTA!", "NTA \n\nWeird reaction. \n\nChange your name to whatever the hell you want!", "NTA. She cannot stop him from changing it, and since it is his professional name there is a reasonable reason to stick with the plan. However, her reaction sounds so strong, it warrants an inquiry as to why she might find the objectional.\n\nIf I were to venture a guess, it has something to do with the fact that she has chosen to use the married name post divorce, and now her son's name would be different. Your husband should talk to her.", "What\u2019s your MIL\u2019s relationship with your (ex?) FIL like?", "NAH.  Ask your husband to have a heart to heart with his mother to find the reason for her odd reaction.  I\u2019m confident you and your husband will come up with a plan that does not upset her.  But even if you pick something that she dislikes, she may warm up to it over time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Go with a new name if she\u2019s going to be like that, your husband can keep mothers name still for his art.", "NTA. And don't let your MIL influence your decision. It's \\*your\\* name.  As Shakespeare said, \"What's in a name if your mother-in-law didn't have about 10,000 things to say about it?\"", "NTA, but I'd strongly suggest keeping his business identity and his personal identity separate.\n\nJust make up a sweet new last name and go for it.", "NTA, but why do you need her permission? It's a name, your partner is related to that family it's really none of her business what your last name is.", "he can change his last name to yours.  that would cut in half the costs and the hassles of the change", "NTA - but I am wondering why OP told her MIL this instead of having her husband talk to his mother about it?\n\nIs the MIL aware that hubby uses her maiden name when he signs his art?  If she is, then I can certainly see how OP thought she'd be happy with this idea.\n\nIt's a rather unusual response from MIL so it's probably best that OP's hubby discuss it with his mother.", "She\u2019s always gushing over me and saying how much she loves me but I think she might be overcompensating because on some level she might have an issue with her son being married at all. They are very, very close and I know it\u2019s an adjustment for her even though he\u2019s 34.\n\nI agree that my husband might have another talk with her. In hindsight, it may have been awkward coming from me instead of him the first time. I\u2019m starting to think she just wasn\u2019t ready for it.", "MIL has a relationship with her parents. I haven\u2019t heard her say anything too negative about her father other than differing political views.", "Also thank you for your comments", "They divorced when my husband was a child. They were in a cult-like environment. MIL and her children had to literally escape. They have been no contact since.", "In that case, maybe she doesn't want another Mrs. X to be there, let alone in her son's life. Definitely get your husband to talk to her, unless he's a complete momma's boy, thwn look for a new name", "I think that\u2019s the ticket. My wife and I decided to take my great-grandma\u2019s maiden name together, and her mom had a strong reaction it. She seems to be fully over it now, and didn\u2019t react strongly to the idea of her second kid changing her name with marriage. Moms do get weird when their kids get married! You\u2019re NTA at all and I think you hit the nail on the head with that.", "NAH.   I suspect that your MIL\u2019s reaction has something to do with the trauma of her past.  Most of the time, knee-jerk uncharacteristic outbursts are linked to something like that.\n\nIt may be that MIL herself has no idea why she reacted that way.   Maybe it was one of those \u201cland mines\u201d that gets buried in our heads - programming from childhood, when bigots taught us falsely.  We spend our entire adult lives digging these up and disarming them, and sometimes they just blow up in our face unexpectedly.  \n\nI would proceed with your plan, but give your MIL some space to warm up to it.   If she does - accept that without comment.   If she doesn\u2019t - ask her why she feels negatively about it.  She may have a very good reason not to want you to use her name.  If that\u2019s the case, maybe the three of you can choose a new name together.", "Thank you. This makes sense to me.", "Hopefully you all can work through it somehow", "NTA it's too bad MIL doesn't get fucking vote in what your names are haha", "She might just have a bit of sadness about being an empty nester and when someone gets married and has kids, they tend to spend Holiday mornings without their parents and get so busy with their own new family unit that the parent is lucky to see them a few times a month. I feel bad for older people who have to go from having a noisy household of kids and love to an empty house that is quiet and lonely. I know my Dad isn\u2019t handling it well right now. I don\u2019t doubt she loves you, she just having to reckon with this new stage of life that feels barren. Maybe have your fianc\u00e9 talk to her.", "In this context, didn't you think her son would be the best person to talk to her...she may not be comfortable sharing why she isn't happy about the name change with you since it relates to her trauma. Even if she has shared some parts of it with you, you may not understand the full extent of it.\n\nLet your husband speak to her and make a decision after that. Her reaction could have been to you telling her rather than the name change itself.", "She wouldn't even be \"another Mrs. X\" since it's his mother's maiden name they'd be using. Surely she knows how her son signs his artwork? Like others have said, it might just be that OP brought it up to her instead of him. Or maybe it was just a reaction to all these new-fangled ideas the kids are into. :) The fact that she didn't go into a rant about it makes me think they've got a chance if the husband talks to her about it. Good luck, OP!"]}
