So this was big for my mom to be able to see my brother again. sadly we lost our dad seven years ago.\n\nSo we got out to our favorite restaurant to eat, well my favorite because of my birthday. It's a Mexican restaurant called Senor Villa and I love their bottomless shrimp for 20.99. Well anyway, my brother is a drinker. He loves alcohol and the minute he gets to the restaurant he orders these expensive shots.\n\nBefore we're about to order, my mom nudges me aside and asks if I could say I wasn't hungry, she said how we could always go another month. This was because she didn't bring enough money and I didn't have enough money to pay for myself. Being the people pleaser I am, I am just like \"Yeah that's great :D.\" About midway through my mom and brother eating I begin crying realizing I was missing my birthday dinner.\n\nWhen we got home I just went to my room and cried and I haven't really brought it up again. A huge regret and immense sadness that I didn't get my bottomless shrimp.\n\nWhen I had asked my mom about it the next day she began to tell me how much of an asshole I made her look in front of my brother and how my father would be disappointed in me. After a yelling match my mom would then tell me we weren't ever going there again.\n\nEDIT: For all you amazing people offering to purchase me my birthday dinner, That means the world to me that you are that kind.

However, that being said I was like you at that age and would have smiled and said sure too. I'm not faulting you at all, but the faster you learn to put a foot down, gracefully and politely, and stand ten toes down on whatever you say and not get pushed around the better life is going to be for you. It's easier to learn know than be a decade into adulthood trying to figure it out. Speak up forself, make reasonable and fair sacrifices when necessary, and dont feel bad for feeling dissatisfied.

But when you look at the situation, you really should never have had to been put in that situation at a birthday dinner. I think a lot of people would be so flabbergasted and caught of guard especially at your age that they would have responded the same way. Your reaction no matter how much you or others think could have been better, simply doesn't matter anywhere near as much when deciding who is TA because no reasonable adult would put their child in that situation. I think you're worried about how you handled it too much and if your feelings are valid when the reality is your mom and brother were TA 1000%.\n\n I think the real take away here is that your trying to decide if you're allowed to feel what you're feeling in this situation and you need to trust your gut, it's right. You feel like you were wronged because you were wronged. That's entirely garbage behavior from 2 adults, and you disrespected and than asked to be okay with it on the spot. I think if you take away 1 thing from this it's that your bs meter is spot on. Now that you know it's working, I'd be a little more confident in speaking up when that meter goes off. \n\nI'd also suggest starting with talking to your mom by saying, I've been thinking and know funds may be tight and understand we all have to make sacrifices, but I was pretty hurt when I wasn't able to eat at my birthday dinner and think we should work on being more open and honest about budgets before hand so that no one else has to feel excluded or let down on their special day. Maybe we could start by saying this is a shared entree or appetizer and 1 drink meal only next time?\" I think as long as you make it clear you don't fault her for not having enough money and make it about your feelings in a way that's not just complaining but saying I want to make this better for everyone so we can all have a good time I think she'd be receptive.

Do you have any money to pay for it? No?

Because I always *felt* my mother putting in a good faith effort.\n\nAll of that to say -- I'm really sorry that your mother is so vitriolic and dismissive toward your needs. Even a mother who is out of resources and overstressed can leave their under supported child feeling loved. How she's acting toward you is so *intentional* and awful.\n\nI hope you are able to find some time for joy and celebration away from your mother.

Like just buying a gift card that you can pick up by giving my username - or sending something to a third party you can trust. Oversharing online is easy to do and risky business, so take no pressure from this offer - it's certainly wise to make privacy a priority online. But I feel compelled to at least offer it, all the same.\n\nEither way -- I just really hope you can find some joy for yourself in the wake of this situation. Take care of yourself as best you can until you can get out and start your own life. I know it's easier to say than do, but cultivating friendships with people who treat you with respect can be a huge boon. It's important to have support systems when you can't rely on family - it can help protect you from other bad actors - partners that turn abusive, exploitative employers.

Good lord, what is wrong with your a-hole brother that he cannot buy you dinner on your birthday? Shame on your Mom for putting you in that position.", "You are definitely not the a hole!", "Tbh I probably would\u2019ve done the same\u2026 NTA", "NTA, get your paperwork ready so you can leave ASAP!\nThat is disgusting behavior, letting your child go hungry!

Disgusting", "As a high school teacher, I just want to say that young people like you are the reason I love my job. Happiest of birthdays to you, and you deserve all of the bottomless shrimp forever.", "[removed]", "That\u2019s awful. She should have been the one to go without food, not her daughter and the person who the dinner was for. Your mum did a really cruel thing. I\u2019m so sorry you have had to deal with this at such a young age.", "OP wasn't raised to think she was allowed to say no.  She even asked here if she were an asshole for crying.    OP was trained to think everything was her fault.\n\nOP is learning that she deserves more than her family gives here; you go from there to learning to say \"no\".  It's a lot to expect that OP could instantly jump to challenging, even in the slightest way, her mother or her brother.", "Thank you.", "Thank you for the birthday wish and kind words <3", "She had her food", "Do you think I should?

I hope you can do something more enjoyable with friends, even if you don't get your shrimp! Happy belated.", "What your Mother did was completely out of line. It was your birthday. She either should have told your brother not to spend so much on drinks or pay himself or forgone her meal. I hope you have many happy birthdays and are treated with consideration.", "Horrible humaning", "\"He's the man of the family\"\n\nthe man of the family is supposed to provide for the family..

As a mom I'm disgusted by yours - Mom Rule #1 is YOU FEED YOUR CHILDREN FIRST. If there's not enough to go around, I ain't eating. \n\nJesus Christ, this makes me fucking incandescent.

Not even to your brother. She's not doing him any favors.", "I'm not understanding why she, as the Mom, didn't forgo her dinner??  Or even suggest splitting something?  Eesh.... that's what Mom's are SUPPOSED to do anyway!", "Just remove the restaurant name and you should be good.", "Best of luck to you, OP. And I'm sorry you had a terrible birthday because of your mother. Best wishes for all birthdays going forward! \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17"]}
