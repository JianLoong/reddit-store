However, that being said I was like you at that age and would have smiled and said sure too. I'm not faulting you at all, but the faster you learn to put a foot down, gracefully and politely, and stand ten toes down on whatever you say and not get pushed around the better life is going to be for you. It's easier to learn know than be a decade into adulthood trying to figure it out. Speak up forself, make reasonable and fair sacrifices when necessary, and dont feel bad for feeling dissatisfied.

But when you look at the situation, you really should never have had to been put in that situation at a birthday dinner. I think a lot of people would be so flabbergasted and caught of guard especially at your age that they would have responded the same way. Your reaction no matter how much you or others think could have been better, simply doesn't matter anywhere near as much when deciding who is TA because no reasonable adult would put their child in that situation. I think you're worried about how you handled it too much and if your feelings are valid when the reality is your mom and brother were TA 1000%.\n\n I think the real take away here is that your trying to decide if you're allowed to feel what you're feeling in this situation and you need to trust your gut, it's right. You feel like you were wronged because you were wronged. That's entirely garbage behavior from 2 adults, and you disrespected and than asked to be okay with it on the spot. I think if you take away 1 thing from this it's that your bs meter is spot on. Now that you know it's working, I'd be a little more confident in speaking up when that meter goes off. \n\nI'd also suggest starting with talking to your mom by saying, I've been thinking and know funds may be tight and understand we all have to make sacrifices, but I was pretty hurt when I wasn't able to eat at my birthday dinner and think we should work on being more open and honest about budgets before hand so that no one else has to feel excluded or let down on their special day. Maybe we could start by saying this is a shared entree or appetizer and 1 drink meal only next time?\" I think as long as you make it clear you don't fault her for not having enough money and make it about your feelings in a way that's not just complaining but saying I want to make this better for everyone so we can all have a good time I think she'd be receptive. Hopefully, you can use it as an experience to learn from by starting to speak up, but also to prevent it from becoming an issue again.

Do you have any money to pay for it? No?

I dont think someone would go through all that trouble right?", "Truthfully I go to a public school and don't have a lot of out of school friends, plus I am in an area where it's very difficult to go so probs not for a while. But I have made myself feel okay about it! Thanks for the belated birthday <3", "Yeah, it was really hard because I never got the shrimp and could smell it's goodness, they give you so many and they taste so good.", "I could also pitch in a few dollars.", "Hey man, thanks, it means a lot that you're really trying to help me <3 My mom is a real case and I will try my best to reason with her.", "He doesn't like talking about work ever truthfully.", "Yea, you're absolutely right, I didn't want to jump to conclusions or go to the most negative thing straight away, but after further review, it seems like that's the case here.", "exactly the same stuff she says sometimes, I am so sorry you had to go through that.", "I do thanks for asking. But I don't think it would be appropriate to share it.", "Thank you <3", "I know, thanks for the advice!", "Narcissist with a huge Ego... If I were you, I'd leave that house as soon as you turn 18, can't reason with people like that.", "Yeah, I wouldn't hold out hope that she'll suddenly care about your feelings or about being \"fair.\" Just get what you need from her (your birth certificate, access to your money, etc.) and try to ignore her. Maybe she'll notice you down the road in future years and apologize.", "Happy birthday OP!", "Feeling bad does not make you a bad person. Have you talked to her about this? Or to your brother?", "No child should be third on their birthday. That\u2019s why it hurt so much this time.", "That genuinely sounds just awful, did they give you any gifts or anything? Did you do or get anything for your birthday?!", "Honestly, I feel like I relate to you a lot and had a parent similar to yours. I just hope you know and like truly, deeply, on every possible level, understand that it's messed up for anyone to treat you that way and that level of disrespect from a parent (or any one really) is just gross and unacceptable. You don't deserve it, you didn't do anything to deserve it, and at the end of the day as long as you know it's messed up, how you choose to handle it it is all you. I just don't want you to go on thinking it's okay or that you should feel okay or just be fine when you get treated like that. It took me a long time to realize it wasn't my fault and I didn't have to put up with it and I just don't want you to suffer as long as I did. You deserve so much better op <3", "Ach it's fine it wasn't abusive or anything, it's just an example of how parents really should think carefully about who they're actually talking to and what they're saying. Words and actions have consequences that once you've let them out there you can no longer control, yes you can have a situation go the way you want it for your own reasons (like your mum hanging you out to dry on your birthday) but you cannot guarantee that the person you're doing it to will be fine with it, and if they're not fine with it you can't guarantee that it won't come back to bite you in the future. I'm not seriously saying go out of your way to spite her but in future when there's a situation where it's \"her or you\" so to speak, get her in the bin and look out for yourself.", "No you should! I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who would like to send you money to cover your birthday dinner.", "I\u2019m also seeing that you didn\u2019t get a birthday gift in your comment history. That\u2019s so fucked up. I\u2019m so sorry op", "Your welcome OP", "That's the goal!!", "This is real important OP!", "I spoke with her about it a few months back, she explained that my brother reminded her a lot of my dad and that she feels connected to dad when my brother is around.", "Thank you, your kind words mean a lot.", "I am not that big into gifts tbh. I mean, I would love a gift but I always understood that we can't always afford them. They didn't get me anything", "Thank you Laney, I know it could take me a very long time to realize what I do and don't deserve, but it means a lot that you're helping me now. I am just glad that I can say I am still here and haven't gone crazy. I dmed you btw <3", "That's quite understandable but it doesn't forgive ignoring or pushing aside your feelings. You don't stop being her daughter just because he's there.\n\nShe should have acknowledged what she asked of you was unfair and that you had a right to be upset about it.", "I\u2019m so sorry OP, I hope you have a belated happy birthday and I\u2019m so sorry you were treated like this. I hope you get your shrimp soon", "I am very upset about it, but knowing my mom she would make everything about her and could never see herself in the wrong.", "Thank you so much!", "I hate to sound pessimistic but some people have crappy parents. \n\nWhat's important is that you find a lesson in this and grow into a better person.\n\nAlso stop pleasing everyone if you're not going to please yourself.", "Your welcome!", "I know! I am working very hard on being better confidence wise!"]}
