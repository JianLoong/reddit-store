{"id": 27374, "submission_id": "16p0xf0", "title": "AITA for holding a ten year grudge after I (F44) was insulted at a job interview?", "selftext": "\nTen years ago I (F44) was approached by a company to interview with their CEO for a position I did not apply for. I agreed to take the interview, which was all set up through the CEO\u2019s assistant. It was a Monday morning breakfast meeting at a hotel restaurant. When the day of the interview arrived, I showed up prepared, copy of CV in hand. I did arrive thirty minutes earlier than the meeting time because I didn\u2019t want to take the chance I might be late. So our meeting was at 8AM. When 8AM arrived, he wasn\u2019t around so I thought maybe he\u2019s stuck in traffic. At 8:15, there is no sign of him. At 8:30, there is still no sign of him so I email their assistant who answers immediately with \u201cLet me make sure they have the right restaurant\u201d and then a few moments later they come back with \u201cPlease stay - he is en route now!\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until very close to 9AM that the CEO arrives, makes a lame excuse  about traffic and then asks the waiter for a menu\u2026and a newspaper. I have a hunch he slept in and/or forgot, but also really surprised he feels there is time for a newspaper. He asks me some really basic questions while eating his breakfast. I think I\u2019m answering them pretty well even though in my head I\u2019m feeling like this interview is not being taken seriously whatsoever. It all ends around 9:20, he says he has a few more candidates but someone will reach out,  and we go our separate ways. I\u2019m not feeling good about it at all, but I still send a thank you email for opportunity. He responds back with \u201cThanks. Best wishes.\u201d I did not hear anything further. It left me feeling somewhat dismissed but more so just really insulted.\n\nFast forward to last year\u2026one of my closest girlfriends (F42) says she met a nice older man (M56?)  through some mutual friends and they\u2019ve had a few nice dates, but it\u2019s not serious. I ask about him and she says \u201cI think you know him, he was CEO of ABC Company.\u201d She remembers me telling her about that awkward interview, and I\u2019m like \u201c It turns out he is still in my industry, working in a senior (but not c-suite) role at a company connected to mine. II\u2019m not a fan of this person and my girlfriend knows this. She tries to smooth it over by telling me she mentioned me and the awkward interview, but he claims he does not remember it happening. My girlfriend insists with him that it happened and he insists back that it didn\u2019t sound like something he would have done. She comes back and tells me this, which you can imagine, did not help. She jokes \u201cI guess I wont be bringing him to your house anytime soon\u201d.\n\nThat was a year ago and they are still together. As I now have a child, I don\u2019t go out often and as a result, haven\u2019t seen her much. When I do it is without him. I know I will have to meet him again at some point, and I will be polite, but I probably will still be feeling this way. Am I the asshole for hanging onto this grudge? Or am I supposed to be ok with the further insult of this guy claiming the awkward interview never happened?", "created_utc": 1695356867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p0xf0/aita_for_holding_a_ten_year_grudge_after_i_f44/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not wishing ill on him.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. He knew he was mean and he pretended it didn't happen. I guess you will just have to pretend it didn't happen but keep a socially acceptable distance from him.", "NTA. Is it really a grudge when he showed you the kind of person he is and you know it\u2019s not a nice one.", "I don't see what the issue is here? You had an encounter which shaped your opinion of a person. Your friend is now dating that person. Surely you can hang out with your friend sometimes without her bf being there? And she can stop bringing up this story to him? NAH", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t help how you feel, as long as you are polite when you meet again you are NTA", "NTA but your grudge is only hurting you.  He isn\u2019t affected at all.", "NTA\n\nYou made a judgement call when you met this person and it is what it is.  He may have changed, he may not have.  He probably doesn't actually remember the interview even though it's still fresh in your mind.  He probably doesn't remember you at all.\n\nBut your feelings are your feelings.  Just be polite when you do meet him again.  Your friend doesn't have to keep bringing this up as she's making it all seem worse.", "NAH I don't think anyone has done anything that rises to asshole. I guess I just don't really understand why you're so insulted? I mean, it wasn't a great interview, but...it happens. But I don't see why him not remembering it is further insult. It probably barely registered as an event to him.", "NAH. The interview obviously wasn't important to him at the time - that's the whole reason you feel insulted, right? And he probably did tons of interviews. So why do you believe he would definitely remember it 10 years later?\n\nThe fact that you describe yourself as holding a grudge after 10 years, for a minorly insulting situation with a near-stranger, is concerning. Maybe work on getting over things better?", "Safe to say he's interviewed (and been an asshole to) many, many people in his roles over the years, so wouldn't be surprised if he actually didn't remember you.  You conducted yourself with class despite his crap behavior so I'd recommend approaching any future interactions with the same level-headed coolness, but definitely don't think you should engage or make an effort to get to know this guy further. That's not holding a grudge, it's choosing not to expend any additional time or energy on a jerk.\n\nFWIW, I interview a lot of high-level, highly compensated individuals in my line of work and have seen a lot.  His behavior was unbelievably rude and unprofessional.", "NAH.\n\nYou're still mad, which is fine...a bit weird as it was 10 years ago and an interview, but fine.\n\nHe very likely does not remember it, which is also fine.\n\nThat your friend mentioned it to him and you? I thought that a bit odd, but it does show that you obsess about this even more than you think if your friends know the story enough to recognize the guy.", "I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t more eager to meet him and see what\u2019s up. He could have changed a lot in the last decade. There also may be some reason he was not so great when you interviewed with him", "Let it go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not trying to be the bigger person at my own expense, soooo... when I inevitably ended up in a room with this man, I'd make a point of asking my friend within his earshot how things were going with them. I'm sure she'd say everything is great, otherwise why is he even there in this future scenario? To which I would reply something like \"Oh, good, I'm so happy to hear that. You know, what with the age difference, and... *Stage whisper* That Memory Problem Of His. But I guess these days your 60s isn't that old, and modern medicine is just moving so fast! Anyway, so glad it's working out. Cheers!\"\n\n\nI don't care if I'm the microscopic person, I'm still gonna come out this match box swinging. \ud83d\ude0e", "Soft YTA. It was personal for you and that's fine. It wasn't personal at all for him. He was probably ticking off a box and didn't see you as a person, let alone a viable candidate. He was doing his job. It's fine to be annoyed a bit of your time was wasted, but you don't know him and he definitely doesn't know you.", "I feel like the list of people I would consider myself \"eager\" to meet is extremely short. I also don't feel the need to dig deeper into the psyche of everyone I have a mild negative impression of. They almost certainly have their reasons for being the way they are, but what does it matter?\n\nIt's unclear if the friend is a close enough friend that OP would ordinarily be excited to meet a new SO, or if it's closer to a friendship where she would have generic good wishes for a new relationship but but feel any particular need to befriend the SO. (But based on OP's age and the fact she has a kid the chances of it being the latter are significantly more than none.) There's nothing wrong with OP being polite but not overly interested in deepening the connection, especially because she already has a negative impression."]}
