{"id": 27374, "submission_id": "16p0xf0", "title": "AITA for holding a ten year grudge after I (F44) was insulted at a job interview?", "selftext": "\nTen years ago I (F44) was approached by a company to interview with their CEO for a position I did not apply for. I agreed to take the interview, which was all set up through the CEO\u2019s assistant. It was a Monday morning breakfast meeting at a hotel restaurant. When the day of the interview arrived, I showed up prepared, copy of CV in hand. I did arrive thirty minutes earlier than the meeting time because I didn\u2019t want to take the chance I might be late. So our meeting was at 8AM. When 8AM arrived, he wasn\u2019t around so I thought maybe he\u2019s stuck in traffic. At 8:15, there is no sign of him. At 8:30, there is still no sign of him so I email their assistant who answers immediately with \u201cLet me make sure they have the right restaurant\u201d and then a few moments later they come back with \u201cPlease stay - he is en route now!\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until very close to 9AM that the CEO arrives, makes a lame excuse  about traffic and then asks the waiter for a menu\u2026and a newspaper. I have a hunch he slept in and/or forgot, but also really surprised he feels there is time for a newspaper. He asks me some really basic questions while eating his breakfast. I think I\u2019m answering them pretty well even though in my head I\u2019m feeling like this interview is not being taken seriously whatsoever. It all ends around 9:20, he says he has a few more candidates but someone will reach out,  and we go our separate ways. I\u2019m not feeling good about it at all, but I still send a thank you email for opportunity. He responds back with \u201cThanks. Best wishes.\u201d I did not hear anything further. It left me feeling somewhat dismissed but more so just really insulted.\n\nFast forward to last year\u2026one of my closest girlfriends (F42) says she met a nice older man (M56?)  through some mutual friends and they\u2019ve had a few nice dates, but it\u2019s not serious. I ask about him and she says \u201cI think you know him, he was CEO of ABC Company.\u201d She remembers me telling her about that awkward interview, and I\u2019m like \u201c It turns out he is still in my industry, working in a senior (but not c-suite) role at a company connected to mine. II\u2019m not a fan of this person and my girlfriend knows this. She tries to smooth it over by telling me she mentioned me and the awkward interview, but he claims he does not remember it happening. My girlfriend insists with him that it happened and he insists back that it didn\u2019t sound like something he would have done. She comes back and tells me this, which you can imagine, did not help. She jokes \u201cI guess I wont be bringing him to your house anytime soon\u201d.\n\nThat was a year ago and they are still together. As I now have a child, I don\u2019t go out often and as a result, haven\u2019t seen her much. When I do it is without him. I know I will have to meet him again at some point, and I will be polite, but I probably will still be feeling this way. Am I the asshole for hanging onto this grudge? Or am I supposed to be ok with the further insult of this guy claiming the awkward interview never happened?", "created_utc": 1695356867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p0xf0/aita_for_holding_a_ten_year_grudge_after_i_f44/", "score": 354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It probably barely registered as an event to him.", "NAH. The interview obviously wasn't important to him at the time - that's the whole reason you feel insulted, right? And he probably did tons of interviews. So why do you believe he would definitely remember it 10 years later?\n\nThe fact that you describe yourself as holding a grudge after 10 years, for a minorly insulting situation with a near-stranger, is concerning. Maybe work on getting over things better?", "Safe to say he's interviewed (and been an asshole to) many, many people in his roles over the years, so wouldn't be surprised if he actually didn't remember you.  You conducted yourself with class despite his crap behavior so I'd recommend approaching any future interactions with the same level-headed coolness, but definitely don't think you should engage or make an effort to get to know this guy further. That's not holding a grudge, it's choosing not to expend any additional time or energy on a jerk.\n\nFWIW, I interview a lot of high-level, highly compensated individuals in my line of work and have seen a lot.  His behavior was unbelievably rude and unprofessional.\n\nETA - NTA", "NAH.\n\nYou're still mad, which is fine...a bit weird as it was 10 years ago and an interview, but fine.\n\nHe very likely does not remember it, which is also fine.\n\nThat your friend mentioned it to him and you? I thought that a bit odd, but it does show that you obsess about this even more than you think if your friends know the story enough to recognize the guy.", "I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t more eager to meet him and see what\u2019s up.

It was personal for you and that's fine. It wasn't personal at all for him. He was probably ticking off a box and didn't see you as a person, let alone a viable candidate. He was doing his job.

I also don't feel the need to dig deeper into the psyche of everyone I have a mild negative impression of. They almost certainly have their reasons for being the way they are, but what does it matter?\n\nIt's unclear if the friend is a close enough friend that OP would ordinarily be excited to meet a new SO, or if it's closer to a friendship where she would have generic good wishes for a new relationship but but feel any particular need to befriend the SO. (But based on OP's age and the fact she has a kid the chances of it being the latter are significantly more than none.) There's nothing wrong with OP being polite but not overly interested in deepening the connection, especially because she already has a negative impression.", "This isn't you holding a ten year grudge.

The guy wasted your time, and you made a perfectly valid judgement of his character.\n\nNTA.", "Nta at all.", "NTA\n\nLol that is typical CEO behavior. \n\nHe either does remember and in his head, it is the most strategically advantageous move to \"not remember\" \n\nOr\n\nHe doesn't remember, because the whole time at the breakfast you weren't important enough to him to remember. Considering he ran very late, gave a BS answer and never apologized this is likely it...but it is also very telling - particularly since he denied it as opposed to apologizing- again after 10 years.\n\nSee, for CEO's, reputation and image mean absolutely everything - even over the truth, ethics or people. Obviously not all of them, but I have yet to meet a CEO where this wasn't true (I am an accountant and have worked in fields where I specifically interacted with hundreds of CEOs and owners either very closely (venture capital) or passively (other fields)).\n\nI wouldn't ever hold onto a grudge in the sense that I would attach negative feelings with it for my own piece of mind, however, you are very right to not want to hang around this guy. The guy is just a shallow image that values that image above all else (otherwise he would simply acknowledge that it happened (even if he doesn't remember) and apologize like a normal person). He is more than likely going to hurt your friend unless he adjusts his values as your friend is more than just an image.", "Do I remember someone I casually met for 20 minutes 10 years ago?

You need to get over yourself, why would he remember you?", "NTA.  The guy made a terrible first impression on you.

That's a horrible experience and you were rightly insulted.\n\nNow however a decade later and outside the professional context, it's probably worth giving the guy another shot.

Ultimately it's costing you a lot more than it's costing them at this point.", "NTA He isn't worth your time knowing. You know he isn't worth your friend's either, but she hasn't figured out he'll treat others the same way he did you. Or she has a really bad standard for how she's treated.", "Maybe he didn't remember you in particular because he is or was generally rude to people he interviewed.", "I mean, I guess NTA, but from my perspective this does not seem like something worth holding a grudge for 10 years over, especially to the point where it could interfere with your friendship.", "YTA. This is a non event, since you didn\u2019t even want the job (you would have applied for the position if you really wanted it). Why be hung up over it TEN years later? The probability of him not remembering you is very high. Let it go. Be like Elsa.", "I think it's actually possible that he doesn't remember.

I'm wondering if there was drinking/substances involved in the original meeting.", "That was my take on it. He was a dick during the interview, but I'm sure he genuinely doesn't remember it happening either. \n\nI think if OP hangs on to the grudge after 10 years, based off of an hour long interaction, then she's TA. Let it go and move on. At the very least, give him a second chance here.", "Probably because op never applied for the interview THEY asked HIM to come only to be treated like something from the bottom of the shoe. \n\nNTA op. Better keep your distance from these types", "I wouldn\u2019t even say N T A, just NAH\u2026.it\u2019s not really a grudge being held, to me a grudge would be \u201cno I refuse to ever be in the same room as him because he ran a crappy interview\u201d and as you said, he probably doesnt remember it cause it was that long ago\u2026crap I can barely remember someone I met for that long a few days ago\u2026.", "He wasn't doing his job.  If he was, he would have been professional and did an actual interview.", "lol explain the gaslighting please?", "You aren't coming  out swinging, you'd just look like a clown for saying that. Dude was a CEO conducting interviews. He likely met hundreds of handicates for interviews over the years. OP's description of the interview was not flattering, so it's not surprising they made no impression on him. Why would  he remember it?", "To me, it sounds like HR or his board told him he had to interview a female candidate and instead he read a newspaper and had breakfast so he could check a box.", "I'm no CEO, but I do hire people for my department.  I've interviewed dozens of people over the years.

That doesn't sound like enough time for OP and the CEO to order, have food arrive, and eat it.\n\nWas OP acting odd, refuse to order food, or something else that foreshortened the interview?\n\nPerhaps the CEO really did just forget the meeting, expected to spend some time with OP, but OP was acting hostile so the CEO cut it short and left.", "Being an hour late is highly offensive, especially when you're aware of the power imbalance. It says \"My time is much more important than yours\". Traffic, etc happens, and maybe he didn't have OP's contact info handy. So he calls his assistant when he realizes that he's going to be late and ask them to apologize and ask OP if she can stay and wait for him. \n\nAlso, for it only lasting 20 minutes:\n\n>It all ends around 9:20, he says he has a few more candidates but someone will reach out, and we go our separate ways.\n\nSaying you have \"a few more candidates but someone will reach out\" sounds like dismissal to me.", "Nta but personally i dont think its healthy to hold onto grudges for 10 years", "NTA", "Nta.", "NTA\u2026I believe if you want to hang onto your grudge and if it dies stuff it and put it on the mantelpiece\u2026that\u2019s your right.

He was late but it happens. A little rude for an interview but hardly personally insulting. By OP\u2019s own accord, he was cordial and polite, even replying to her follow up email wishing her the best. I can\u2019t remember the HR people who hired me 10 years ago, much less remember 1 of 10-20 people I would\u2019ve interviewed back then.", "??? What did he do that was *that* terrible? Yes, he was a little late. Slightly rude but it does happen. I was late to an interview once because of traffic, even though I left as early as I could. It happens. Otherwise, OP herself claims he was cordial and polite to her and even wished her well and replied to her when she followed up. Are we reading the same story because for the life of me I cannot figure out what exactly it is that this man did that was so unforgivable or proves he\u2019s an awful person not worthy of dating the friend\u2026?", "He was exceptionally rude and now lies about it by saying it is something he would not do.

He showed up to the team office at like 10 AM for the interview. The team execs show up like an hour late, and are clearly hungover and dishevelled (they were obviously out partying the night before).

Interviews given, probably in the high hundreds.  I'm a  white dude, not a woman.  Not complaining about my job opportunities, just sharing my perspective as a management consultant that being treated dismissively after being invited to interview is something I see a lot when some manager is checking a box, rather than conducting a serious interview.", "Cynical me guesses they needed a female applicant to meet a quota and went and found one not intending to give any weight to the interview.
