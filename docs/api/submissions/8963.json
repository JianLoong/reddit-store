I put her home into the GPS so I could have directions back to her general area, and resume driving on the highway. She then opened the car door while we're on the highway, which makes me cross a few lanes immediately to get into the emergency lane. She then tells me she's getting out and she'll figure it out. I tell her this doesn't make sense and to get back into the car. She says it's ok she'll figure it out and asks where we're at. I show her where we're at on GPS and then she says ok. I speed off. She calls me back crying because she's scared. Now she's upset because I sped off, because I left her, because I didn't wait for her, and because I put her in an unsafe situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675360263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rvzme/aita_for_leaving_my_exgf_on_the_highway/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were nice for going back to get her I would have never!", "YOU put HER in an unsafe position? WHAT?? SHE OPENED THE CAR DOOR WHILE YOU WERE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY. She is manipulative, stupid, crazy and all kinds of other bad things. Thank god she\u2019s an ex NTA", "NTA \n\nShe put you in an unsafe situation by opening the car door while you are driving.

I hope you didn\u2019t go back for her.", "NTA. Yheah its not cool to leave someone on the highway, but she was calling for it. If someone is opening a door of the car while driving - that's dangerous and you had no reason to keep driving her. Especially as she told you to don't drive her anymore.\n\nShe had her phone, so she could have called a taxy or Uber or a friend. So not your fault.", "NTA she tried to pin you down with her stupid decisions. Red flag, and psycho. Bail.", "NTA this is all on her. She demanded you stopped, did something wreckless and got out of the car. You cannot force her to stay in the car. She made the choice as a grown adult. Not your responsibility", "\u2026 is she ok? Like, mentally? I\u2019m not even trying to be a jerk but WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND OPENS A CAR DOOR ON THE HIGHWAY?? And insists on getting out? And then blames you for letting her get out? Like, was she expecting you to hold her hostage in your vehicle or drive slowly beside her until she changed her mind???\n\nThis is next level toxic, manipulative BS and you need to just\u2026 not with her. You should\u2019ve let her \u201cfigure it out\u201d like she said she would instead of rewarding her bad behavior. NTA.", "You're NTA. If that kind of theatrical behavior and deflection of blame was a preview of common attractions, you are better off with her as an ex.", "INFO\n\nYou paint her as irrational and yourself as fairly rational. This is unlikely.\n\nThis particular snap-shot comes across as maybe not the asshole. So I suspect a fuller story isn't as good a look.", "ESH\n\nAttempting to open the door and get out of a moving vehicle is dangerous behavior and a massive red flag in terms of maturity and conflict resolution.\n\nI saw a woman do that while a car was going like 15 miles an hour and she actually did jump out and had to be taken away in an ambulance because the real world is not like the movies.\n\nThat being said...\n\nYou left your girlfriend, on a dark deserted highway, in the middle of the night...completely alone and at the mercy of being hit by a car who accidentally swerved, or kidnapped and god knows what else by someone who noticed a woman on the side of the road\n\nOr even arrested.  Walking alone the highway is illegal in a lot of places so as to avoid hitchhiker problems.\n\nShe was pissed.  I get it\n\nBut you are still an adult and you don't leave people, especially ones you care about, in danger like this...regardless of whether or not they are your friend, family member, or significant other\n\n*I understand you don't want me around right now.  But I am not leaving you here alone.  So either you let me take you home, or I will sit here while you call someone else to pick you up.

I wouldn't have let her out of the car, but she clearly wanted attention.", "NTA She put herself in an unsafe situation. If you tried to force her to stay in the car you would be abusive, controlling and could be accused of kidnapping.\n\nYour GF got exactly what she asked for. I don't know what she was trying to accomplish, but it sounds as if she was trying to manipulate you somehow. You were in a no-win situation. Women should not play games like this. Say what you mean, and mean what you say.\n\nWhy did she do this? What was the point? Did she want you to beg repeatedly to stay in the car? She sounds like a nut, too much drama, and none too bright.", "NTA\n\nShe was going to jump out and you already gave her a chance to rethink it.  She is grown and said she could deal with it.  She's playing a game and you should evaluate your relationship.", "NTA, she put herself in a dangerous situation by insisting that she be left there. This is very manipulative behavior and I'd suggest you cut contact since you've already broken up", "YTA because you left someone alone in an area where it\u2019s hard to get transportation. I think you should\u2019ve waited a little bit away until you knew she\u2019d make it home safely.\n\nTo be clear, she acted like the biggest AH here. She\u2019s also a person who deserves to be in a safe location at least when throwing a tantrum. She wasn\u2019t in a space to ensure her own safety, and it would\u2019ve been nice for you to make sure she would be safe getting home.", "ESH.\n\nYou should have called the police the moment she left the car.\n\nShe could have died, and some random driver, who has nothing to do with your situation and with your life decisions, would have had it on their conscience for the rest of their life.", "NTA.  Be careful what you ask for.", "[removed]", "NTA. And you should NOT have gone back to get her. She opened the door on a bleeding highway. For me, that's that person never setting foot in my car again. She wouldn't have had a choice about getting out", "Here's the thing. I would break up with her because of this. What she did was incredibly dangerous, rude, and would be a deal breaker for me. At the same time- I wouldn't have left her. She was being irrational, but she also could have died. If she insisted on getting out, fine- and of course you're not \"obligated\" to not leave her (as in, it's not against the law), but you really should have sat in the median, blinkers on, and made sure she got off the highway/picked up safe. Being a pedestrian on the side of a highway is very dangerous. \n\nSo, I'll go with ESH. Her more than you.", "I did. I may be a sucker, but not an asshole lol", "My exact thought. There's more to the story here.", "Nah, because if she gets upset (again) while they're driving, she could cause an accident and injure/kill them both or others. \n\nShe's an adult. She made her choice.", "Women are equal to men, which means there decisions should be respected. She decided to get out of the car and walk home. Anything resulting from that is 100% not OP's responsibility.", "So youre saying she cant make her own decision, she shouldnt be taken seriously and is forced to do what people think is best for her because shes a woman? No. Shes an individual making the decision to be dropped off. And OP literally could go to jail if crazy GF decided to get him arrested for kidnapping. If shes saying she wants to get out and OP is refusing to let her.. thats kidnapping, at least were i live. And by the sounds of it that GF could be that crazy. \n\nAnd OP literally drove back to pick that Girl up dude?", "Short of physically getting her in the car and begging for her to get in (which is probably what she wanted) what is he gonna do?
