She and I have what I perceive to be a great relationship - she talks to me, laughs with me, tells me who she has a crush on, gets excited when we spend one on one time together, gets angry at me when I tell her \"no\" and every now and then comes and cuddles on the couch when we watch TV. She spends half her time with me, and half her time at her dad's house.\n\nHer father has a wife and together they have three other children. My daughter loves her stepmother, referring to her as her \"other mum\". That's fine. But I started to have my suspicions about how her stepmother talks about me. There were little things, like my daughter saying things to me that she clearly hadn't thought of herself. Offering opinions that clearly weren't her own.\n\nSo I looked through her phone. Hear me out. Yes, I know that's not ok. I know it's private and that it was an invasion of privacy. It came from a place of genuine concern. I found that I was right, my daughter's stepmother openly and actively undermines me, says nasty things about me and seems to be trying to get my daughter to hate me.\n\nThings I found:\n\n1. Repeated instances of stepmother encouraging my daughter not to talk to me until I respond to messages stepmother sent me.\n\n2. Screenshots of message I sent to stepmother and she makes fun of my good grammar (\"I mean, why does she feel the need to write so formally, it's just a message, it's like she's trying to show off!) I'm a professional brand writer; it's just how I write.\n\n3. Turning things I say into running jokes. For example, I had been encouraging my daughter to find a hobby to get her away from screens, and there were repeated instances of \"haha, maybe that should be your hobby!\".\n\n4. Many, many times where stepmother says things like, \"I mean, I should just ask your mum to come have a coffee with me so we can be friends, but your mum would never come\", which, for the record, she has never done.\n\nShe also calls me rude. Now, to be honest, I am not the most friendly person to her, because I have had my suspicions for a long time about what has been going on. I am not overly friendly, I am polite, but never rude. I don't actually care what she says about me. But I do care that my daughter has this constant barrage of negative talk about me because it's never my daughter who instigates it, and she doesn't wholeheartedly engage in any of this. I want to put a stop to it. I want to talk to her father about it, beause maybe he doesn't know what's going on? But I'm afraid of putting more pressure on my daughter (because I don't actually think the behaviour would stop, I just think they would stop putting it in writing), and I'm also afraid that her father will just belittle my concerns. Also, to brign anything up, I would have to tell my daughter I had gone through her phone. No matter what my good intentions were, I understand that that is a complete betrayal of trust. \n\nWhat do I do?", "created_utc": 1689916406, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155e7b8/aita_for_reading_my_daughters_messages_to_her/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, I'm going against most and definitely deem you NTA.\n\nEverything considered, there is no way I'd tell her what you did and I wouldn't make a practice of it.  BUT, I would try to have a conversation at the appropriate time in which I felt her out on some of this.  You are close and this should come naturally, no pressure.  I assume you do not badmouth her father or stepmom to her so you can honorably state that that would not be a good thing to do in either direction.  To begin with, she has fondness to some degree for all of you and, trust me, she doesn't really appreciate it when her stepmom criticizes you.  That may definitely bite her butt someday.  \n\nSo, now you know what you are dealing with.  You are the adult here and need to carefully figure what, if anything, you need to do at this point.

That you hope she would never talk about anyone behind their back as it's nasty to do that. If she ever has a problem with someone, she should speak to them directly and not talk about them behind their back, and if she ever has a friend that did that, she should feel empowered to say that is not nice.\n\nAlternatively ask your daughter if you can read her messages between her and her stepmother as you are concerned about things?

My bet is that any family court judge would see this as that. I suggest you approach the father, tell him what you found, and tell him that if he tells your daughter that you went snooping through her phone and if stepmom doesn't completely stop with the alienation, you'll take him to family court. \n\nI'd say that's your best shot at your daughter not finding out about your breaking her trust, but honestly, the stepmom will almost certainly find a reason or way to tell your daughter what you did. \n\nIs there a way that you can legitimately search your daughter's phone?

Do you go through self awareness and relationship types with her? I had to talk to my son about this from an early age because the family have a few emotionally dangerous people. Taking indirectly about character, what kind of things we value in relationships with friends, different ways people get their needs met and relate. How they feel loved and connected. It all helps build their self awareness and deeper understanding of other people. Fundamentally, you have to remember your daughter needs to emotionally survive half of her life with this woman.

Stepmom can try all she wants, but you are your daughter's mother and seemingly a good one at that. You have a bond. The time that you spend together and the work/love/consistency that you put into your bond will impact her more than Stepmom's words. She will know and feel what is real versus simply hearing what is not. Focus your concern on just you two. You can't control what SM does but you can control what you do.", "Info: what do you mean ideas that weren't her own?\n\nIt sounds like you and daughter have a good relationship-and also like you are her mum and you get on her tits sometimes (the screentime thing is such an ah parent thing to do). Sounds like stepmother is more like an older sister. The two red flags are mocking screenshots and putting your daughter in the middle of stuff between you and stepmother.\n\nIdk if there's a good answer. If you continue to be a good and trustworthy mom, your daughter will eventually see thru step mothers shit. If you confront daughter,no matter how gentlu,  the teen years are prob gonna be hell, and likely your daughter will forgive you when she grows up more. Either choice is gonna be hard. \n\nBasically stepmom.is the ah, otherwise nah", "I would agree with you if there wasn't (apparently) already an understanding (I'm guessing an unsaid understanding?) that OP would basically treat her daughter's phone like she would treat her diary. \n\nI frequently point out that our phones have basically become a 21st century version of our diaries. We might not make \"Dear Diary\" entries, but they contain equivalent information. I just find that this analogy helps people understand why snooping through a person's phone without their permission is such a potentially bad idea. We basically process it the same as someone reading our diary. \n\nThat's why I encouraged OP to come up with a legit reason for going through her phone. The daughter will probably fight it, but there are tons of legit excuses to do it and it won' be such a perceived violation of privacy. \n\nThen OP has to drop the hammer on the ex and stepmom. If my ex and his wife tried to pull this scummy manipulative crap, this would be when the doom music kicks in. Metaphorically. I would absolutely lawyer up and take them to family court for parental alienation. No excuses, no apologies, haul that woman before family court. \n\nIf OP's daughter was in her late teens or over 18, I would say she has to come clean. But with a 14-year-old, I don't think it's that bad of an idea to find a way to cover up the initial snooping and get the texts \"legitimately\". She doesn't even have to come up with an elaborate or extremely convincing excuse, as long as she's upfront about what she's doing, because once the texts come out, all attention will switch to the wicked stepmother and her texts and OP will be able to completely justify why she demanded to look through the phone.", "100% this. \n\nI'd keep those screenshots for court, too. I wouldn't be surprised if the judge reams stepmother and dad for perpetrating this kind of behavior. It's totally inappropriate.", "Absolutely!", "This is key, ask daughter if you can read texts. That you have sensed she is being influenced.", ">This isn\u2019t parental alienation, she\u2019s not saying anything that can be construed as telling your daughter to avoid you (except for 1\n\nParental alienation is more than telling a kid to avoid you. It's badmouthing the target parent to the kid and talking about adult matters which seems to be the case.", "What would happen if she took them to court? I mean, what would she get out of it? No more visits with dad?", "So how are things looking the next day? Have you come up with a plan yet? As I said in another comment, as long as you have a good enough excuse to go through her phone (which shouldn't be hard since she's 14), the focus will quickly turn from you going through her phone to the Disney manipulative stepmother.\n\nHowever, I actually changed my mind on a piece of my advice. I don't think you should approach the ex or stepmom after officially finding the texts. I think you should talk to a lawyer first. When they find out that you have copies of the texts, there will be excuses, half-assed apologies, and gaslighting. This woman is morally bankrupt, and your ex is a hardcore enabler. My prediction is that it's either going to take a judge to make them change their ways, or some sort of cease-and-desist letter from a lawyer with the threat of going to family court for parental alienation. They clearly have zero respect for you, and I doubt they're going to listen to you.\n\nGood luck, OP. It's unwise to come between a mother and her child. Teach them that lesson. Legally.", "It is unfair and definitely seems like she's trying to mess up your relationship. I would screenshot and talk to a your ex then a lawyer this *seems* like parental alienation or atleast the first stages of it. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this and I hope step mom comes to her senses.", "A lawyer will tell her not to file. There\u2019s not enough going on.", "NTA. I snoop in my kids phones all the time. It\u2019s my job as a parent to monitor who they talk to. I don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks. Take screenshots and speak to her father. This is parental alienation.", "You have a delicate step parenting problem, a 13 year old girl and a privacy challenge- you're going to have to get crafty here. Wait till your daughter is out of the room and crack the screen of her phone with a hammer. Tell her you dropped it by accident when you were moving it off the table, apologize abjectly and tell her you'll take it to the repair place while she's at school. And screenshot the texts. When she gets home tell her the phone has a new screen but you need to talk to her. The repair guys asked you to test the phone before taking it home and you saw some texts from stepmom that have you concerned.  \n\nIs this 3 layers of lying? Hell yes it is and worth every penny. There's about 13 ways this could go radioactive on you so it's worth some FBI level stealth.\n\n\nTell her that she's 1000% not in trouble and this is absolutely not anything she's doing wrong but you're going to need to talk to Dad and stepmom. Her stepmom clearly adores your daughter and you're so glad they're tight (ya, you're stretching here but it's for the greater cause) but that stepmom is going about it in an awkward way. It's not ok to speak badly of someone's other parents- it just puts everyone in a tough place. Ask her if she's ever seen girls at school try to get closer by badmouthing other girls- how they don't mean badly and are just trying to build a friendship but that it comes at a cost to everyone else. Tell her it happens at work too- coworkers try to bond by talking about other coworkers.\n Repeat again, your daughter is absolutely not in trouble and you know her stepmom is crazy about her but you're going to need to talk to her Dad and Stepmom about the way she's going about it.\n\nThen ask your husband to meet with you and show him the screenshots. Keep your ass planted on the highest ground. Tell him that you're so happy stepmom loves your daughter but you need his help keeping the tone \"positive everyone supports family\" and less mean girls bonding. And that he needs to start monitoring his daughters texts - make him the bad guy not you- and continue coaching his wife. Tell everyone you'll be reserving the right to keep monitoring texts.\n\nNTA", "NTA - take screen shots and talk to your lawyer", "NTA about the whole thing in general. However, as parent, you have the right to say to your daughter, \"please bring your phone here and show me the text history between you and your step mother\". You also have the right to confiscate the phone until she does this (so texts cannot be deleted or modified). You could even tell her you only want to read that history and nothing else.\n\nI'd rather be open with her about it and have her know you're reading the texts rather than have her think you snooped behind her back to read them.\n\nYou're sort of TA here for doing the reading of the text messages behind her back.", "Yup, YTA.  You breach a teenager's privacy only when you truly need to because you are concerned for her individual safety and/or well-being, not because you think you are being maligned.  This holds true even if you turn out to be right in the end.  If your relationship was so great with your daughter in the first place, why on earth did you not take a direct honest approach with her?", "YTA - you file this info away and never directly bring it up. The first thing to confirm the stepmom's words is to show you read your daughter's messages.", "NTA. I second this.", "I don\u2019t think actively looking for a way to deceive her daughter will achieve the desired results. I didn\u2019t see the comment about the promise that was made to respect the child\u2019s phone privacy, that does change things. \n\nParents aren\u2019t perfect and we make mistakes just as much if not more than the average person. OP messed up yes, but in doing so awarded herself a valuable teaching opportunity. I would own up to my actions, explain why I did it and apologize for crossing an agreed upon boundary. \n\nOP, from what you describe, your relationship with your daughter is very healthy and honestly wonderful. She loves and respects but is being put in a very hard situation for a child who just gained a new parent. I don\u2019t know y\u2019all or the situation beyond this post, but I think your daughter would respond better to being given the truth and treated with the same respect she\u2019s expected to give."]}
