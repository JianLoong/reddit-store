They were very easy to be confuse for one another because they also had similar hair and styles and even similar voices when heard through a wall. I (20m) was in my room and wanted to get some dessert from my downstairs fridge. I had some ice cream sandwiches and didn\u2019t feel very sociable so I knew it would be a 30 second to 1 minute grab and go. I had pajama pants on and a jacket that was unbuttoned so my midriff was exposed. I thought nothing of it and thought it was just my 2 roommates downstairs seeing how it was about 10:45 pm. My roommates were always fine if I was shirtless or even in my underwear because they always grew up with brothers, so I thought nothing of it. But instead of seeing my two roommates I saw her friend so I said hi, grabbed my sandwich, and went back upstairs. About a 30 second grab. But the next day I was greeted to a text filled with insults that I had made her friend uncomfortable and unsafe by showing my midriff. When I tried to explain what I was doing and that I felt that wasn\u2019t my fault she explained that I\u2019m not a girl and wouldn\u2019t understand.

It's possible her friend has had bad experiences with men in the past.\n\nThat said, I don't think you're in the wrong for walking around *in your own home* without a shirt.\n\nApologizing doesn't necessarily mean you were wrong or that you can't also stand your ground on a particular issue.

However, I want to say that this is my home and I will occasionally walk around without a shirt.

You didn't do something terrible, but you should still apologise for decency's sake. And you could agree to be more careful to inform each other that you have guests.
