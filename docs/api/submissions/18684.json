Over that time, we\u2019ve been to over a dozen weddings of our respective friends and family. The invitations have always been addressed to both of us as a married couple. Many times I\u2019ve gone to her friends\u2019 weddings where I only know 1 or 2 people and she\u2019s been in the same situation with my friends\u2019 weddings. We\u2019ve always made new acquaintances and had great times.\n\nLast month she received a wedding invitation from an old high school friend. The problem is that it was address to only her and didn\u2019t mention me or a plus one. We know that this friend knows we\u2019re married as they attended our wedding. We thought this was an oversight so she called her friends and was told that they had a huge list of people and had to cut down the list and I didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nI\u2019ve never heard of one married partner being invited to a wedding without the other. I asked my large group of friends and family and no one has ever heard of such a thing. The other part that makes me feel uncomfortable is that the wedding is in her home state so she\u2019ll be flying back there alone. Lastly, 3 of her ex\u2019s will be in attendance because they used to be part of the same friends group. 1 from HS and 2 from college.\n\nI know I\u2019m sounding very possessive but I promise I\u2019m not. My wife sometimes goes out with her girlfriends and have even gone on a couple of girls only vacation and I\u2019ve never had a problem before. However, I find this entire situation to be weird.\n\nLast night as she was looking for her airline ticket, I told her I was uncomfortable with her going without me. She said I wouldn\u2019t have fun as I won\u2019t know anyone there and that she\u2019ll be busy catching up with old friends. Then I suggested I come back to that state and go fishing with her father as he and I usually take a fishing trip once a year together. She shut that idea down immediately and said I should stay home and relax. I don\u2019t know if it was because I was already uneasy with the trip but it felt like she didn\u2019t want me anywhere near the state.\n\nAfter some back and forth, I told her I am very uncomfortable with the entire thing and that started a heated discussion where I ended it by telling her she shouldn\u2019t go and if she does this will cause a deep rift between us. I\u2019ve never said those words before so I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m an AH right now.", "created_utc": 1685616679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xecxg/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_shouldnt_go_to_a/", "score": 2326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't even want her to be in a different state without you being in the vicinity? But you're not being possessive...\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been married for ten years and you\u2019re worried about her college and her HS exes?

She doesn\u2019t need to revolve her life around your insecurities.", "YTA\n\n>I know I\u2019m sounding very possessive but I promise I\u2019m not.\n\n'I'm not being possessive, but I don't want my fully-grown adult wife flying back to her home state alone to attend a wedding and if she does I'm going to blame her for my reaction to it'.\n\nYou *are* being possessive - worryingly so. Your wife should be able to take a fight and go to a wedding alone without you kicking off like this. You are basically telling her that you don't trust her and that she needs to be accompanied by you to make sure she's going to behave herself.\n\n>I ended it by telling her she shouldn\u2019t go and if she does this will cause a deep rift between us.\n\nNo. YOUR trust issues are going to cause the 'deep rift' between you and I really recommend you deal with them before you push your wife away.", "INFO: Why are you uncomfortable with her traveling back to her hometown alone? And if you are not going to the wedding, what is the point of accompanying her on the trip?", "For me, the red flag in this scenario is her absolute reluctance in your going with her at all. Stay home and relax instead of fishing with her dad? Why? Why did she shut that down so quickly when it\u2019s an activity you do with her dad annually? \n\nHow long will she be gone? Why is she so insistent you don\u2019t go at all? If the friend getting married attended your wedding and you have an existing friendship with them, why is a *spouse* being cut from the invite list? \n\nYes, some of your actions/comments make you seem possessive, but after 10 years of marriage her behavior is a bit suspect. This wedding is also costing you and your wife money - plane ticket, lodging (unless she\u2019s staying with her family), likely dinners out\u2026 I\u2019m assuming shared finances here, of course. \n\nIf my husband were to be solo invited to a wedding, he would RSVP a hard no. NTA.", "So the Reddit crowd is going to just call you an AH and to be honest you are sounding a bit insecure. While you may be the AH here I know if I spoke to my wife about feeling uncomfortable about her going alone she would not go out of respect for me and our relationship as that is much more important than an old friends wedding. One thing she would not do is dismiss my feelings on the matter which is what it sounds like may be happening in your post. I guess a big question you need to ask yourself is do you trust your wife? I don\u2019t know anything more about your relationship than what you typed but it sounds to me like you do not trust her. Now the only question here is if she has given you a reason not to trust her because if not  then yea your TA and you guys should probably talk about your insecurities.", "INFO: Do either of you go on solo trips? Or do you insist on doing everything together?", "YTA. Yeah, it was rude for the couple not to invite you. But you\u2019re using it as an excuse to be extremely weird and controlling. She\u2019s not trying to keep you away from the state, she\u2019s trying to prevent you from following her to this wedding like she\u2019s a teenager and you\u2019re her chaperone. Just stop.", "Flying with her and going fishing with your FIL sounds like a nice compromise.\n\nUnless your wife is worried that you won\u2019t actually go fishing, and you will secretly pack your wedding attire and insist on going to the wedding *anyway*, not invited, and make a scene. ESH", "YTA you\u2019re coming off as controlling and immature. But it seems this is more of a case of you feeling miffed by the perceived slight, and you want to protest rather than allow your wife some time to enjoy herself with old friends. Don\u2019t be so selfish.", "YTA. Yes, it is weird to be invited, but do you trust her? If she wants to go alone, let her go? Or are there other problems between you two. If you already said that there are exes, you don't trust her. It is normal to have some trips separately.", "YTA\n\nI think you should really consider the notion that she's going alone because you're being overbearing and possessive. I also think you should do some work on your insecurities. That's what's causing the rift, not her going to visit some old friends by herself. What she's doing is perfectly normal.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s very rude to only invite one half of a married couple that\u2019s been together for a decade+. It\u2019s weird that your wife sees no issue with you being snubbed but I could look past that as she just wants to see her old friends and is willing to allow them to exclude you to do so. I can also understand your apprehension and the multiple ex\u2019s is just icing on the cake.\n\nWhat makes its bizarre and tips it from N A H to NTA for me is her automatic and immediate shut down of you being anywhere near this wedding. Why can\u2019t you fly out there with her and just go fishing with her dad that weekend? Why does she not want you anywhere near this wedding? That\u2019s kinda sketchy. If she can\u2019t give you a good reason why she doesn\u2019t want you around *at all* then I would dig my heels in about this.", "YTA. Not possessive yet you want to be in the same state at least? Yeah op very telling. Whilst the No plus one was a bit weird from her friends, it\u2019s her friends wedding. And you are being extremely controlling. Get over yourself op and let your wife live", "NTA . You offered a very good compromise to go fishing with her dad, and she turned you down flat.  That is a little weird to me. Ask her why she is so against you going. I'm guessing she wants to bust loose and party with your friends, but for you not to see it.", "YTA. It\u2019s not unusual to only invite 1 person if you\u2019re on a budget and numbers are tight. How are you not being possessive seriously what is your problem you don\u2019t have to do everything together! You\u2019ve been married for 10 years you seriously have an issue with her exes?! You are being controlling cut that shit out now, telling her it will cause problems in your relationship?! Yeah you TA. A few days apart is hardly a big deal.", "YTA\n\nI would be perfectly fine with my husband going to a wedding of a highschool friend without me.\n\nIf it was a mutual friend that we were equally close to, I\u2019d definitely be hurt if only one of us were invited. \n\nBut someone he went to school with, that I barely know? Doesn\u2019t bother me at all. Weddings are expensive. I\u2019d hate for the getting-married-couple being forced to miss out on having someone they\u2019re *actually close to* at the wedding, just so they could have me there as a +1 to my husband. \n\nAs for exes being there\u2026what does that have to do with anything? If your wife is trustworthy, it doesn\u2019t matter who is there. If she\u2019s not trustworthy, you have a bigger issue than a solo wedding invite. (Also, what is it you would expect to change if you were there? You going to spend all night glaring daggers at the exes, or possessively holding her hand so they don\u2019t forget she\u2019s taken?)", "NTA they are being rude to you. I wouldn\u2019t go if my husband wasn\u2019t invited.", "NTA. She\u2019s dismissing you\u2019re feelings so she can go and do whatever she wants guilt free. And she will do whatever she wants.", "YTA for issuing a kind of ultimatum. That's not okay, no matter what your feelings are. That's manipulative. \n\nI personally don't see an issue, but I can understand why others do. If your wife has not given you any reasons to be suspicious or not trust her, you've voiced your opinions and now it's time for you to deal with your own feelings about her decision. \n\nWhy can't you just.... Enjoy the time to yourself and let her enjoy a few days seeing old friends? Absence makes the heart grow fonder, or so I hear. You could plan a nice evening for when she gets home.", "YTA. I don't think it's unheard of to not invite plus-ones (even spouses) when space is limited and the \"extras\" aren't also friends of the couple getting married. Plus it's not going to hurt your marriage to go on separate adventures sometimes. Why not take advantage of the opportunity and plan a fun weekend for yourself featuring activities that you wouldn't ordinarily do with your wife? Get some buddies together and go fishing, or go to one of those places that lets you drive a racing car, or find the best restaurant in the region for some sort of food you love that your wife isn't keen on, or make a minigolf course in your garage and hold an after-dark tournament, or hop on a plane to visit a friend you haven't caught up with in ages - the possibilities are endless! I hope you're both able to have a fabulous time apart for a few days, which will make coming home to each other all the sweeter. \ud83c\udf37", "YTA. It's okay to have friends and interests outside of your significant other.", "YTA. It was very rude and completely wrong of the couple not to invite you.  But your wife is an adult and decides for herself if she wants to go or not.  I would also be hurt that my partner wasn\u2019t sticking up for me but attempting to control her is wrong.", "NTA, why can\u2019t you go and make a chill weekend  with her dad and hangout with her after,weird that she\u2019s so specific she doesn\u2019t want you near at all.", "1.

It is your wife\u2019s friend. It\u2019s okay to feel some sort of way about being excluded, but this comes down to being a small wedding and you didn\u2019t make the cut for an invite.

It's not about \"letting\" her go, you should respect her enough that this shouldn't even be a question.\n\nI don't think she was being dismissive of your feelings, I think it is on you to work through those, this is a hurt caused by your own doing.\n\nShe likely doesn't want you there because the feeling of treading on tiptoes sucks - I've been there. My past relationship was coercive control and I'm not saying you're at that level, I don't have enough info... But it's the worst feeling. So tense, you never know what they will say next. The sarcastic comments. The fear just destroys any nice time you were going to have. So if she felt like you'd sulk even a fraction of that... I get it.\n\nAlso, I did a poll when I was getting married, about whether it's rude not to invite partners. Most people said no, these days it's normal. Some said they thought it was odd, but not rude. Especially if your wedding isn't traditional (ours wasn't). Off the basis of that poll and ALL the stress I felt as a Bride-to-be fearing offending others, we made decisions for us. I don't regret it. The people who care respected all our choices. People we are mega close to got their partner. And partners we regularly spent time with were also invited. But it was OUR wedding, we didn't have to pay for random people at the expense of crossing someone we know very well off the list. Honestly only maybe like a couple of people didn't get their partner. And NO, don't give me that BS about \"why should we celebrate you if you won't acknowledge us\" - put your toys back in the pram for real, do you say on people's birthdays that everyone should get you gifts too? \n\nYou met them once like 10 years ago lol, also you probably give off controlling vibes, so maybe that was why...", "There could be loads of things going on here.\n\nPerhaps said friend doesn't like you? Maybe her partner doesn't like you? So you didn't make the cut, but your wife is still her/their friend and they want her to be there. Maybe someone who will be in attendance doesn't like you and they're trying to avoid a conflict or just some awkwardness that would happen if you were there. It is weird that they only invited your wife, but I'm thinking there's more to it than needing to cutting down on people in attendance.\n\nIf you come along, is there a chance you're going to just try to get in because they can't turn you away if you're already there? Will there be activities afterward that they don't want you to join in on that they know you would insert yourself into if you were in the state? Is there a possibility that while she's at the wedding/reception, you'll be trying to convince her to come back to wherever you are 'cos you're \"lonely\" and \"missing her?\"\n\nMaybe after 10 years of marriage, your wife just wants a chance to do something by herself.\n\nThat said, YTA.\n\nJust let your wife have a second without you to enjoy time with her friends. It's not always about what you want. And just because you're married, doesn't mean you have to do everything together (yes, you mentioned she's gone on girls trips before, so why is this one an issue?)

I'll grant you that it's not ideal etiquette for the couple to invite only one half of a married pair, but when you only have so much money to spend and they don't really know you, it's a safe cut for them to make without hurting anyone's feelings.

That's sad and will probably blow up in OP's face.\n\nIt also doesn't sound like the bride knows OP that well or at all. And, this was her childhood friend. I know people get very fired up about plus-1 etiquette, but if the couple doesn't know my partner, not getting a second invite wouldn't offend me. It's in my court to accept or decline. I also understand someone wanting to invite an individual without doubling their guest list by giving everyone a plus 1 that they do not know at all......

Maybe seeing what the end result of her being out of town would be and making it a decision on asking for couple\u2019s therapy, if not divorce. Heck, she might be wanting to ask her parents if she could move in if things go south, or wanting to be with them while the divorce papers are served to OP in another state.\n\nCheating isn\u2019t on my radar, the overall health of their relationship and the signal that things might be far rockier than OP realizes is.", ">She shut that down immediately?

If his *first* response to not being invited (and confirming it wasn't an accident) wasn't a bunch of fuss, but rather \"huh, well if I can't go to the wedding maybe I could arrange something else in the area and still take advantage of a nice trip\" then that wouldn't be so suspicious.

And to clarify, by space, I don't mean a short separation or anything like that. I mean that it's healthy to do things without SO sometimes. Remembering that one is an autonomous being is crucial for a healthy relationship. And don't get me wrong - if I were in his position, I might feel insecure or uncomfortable, too.

I feel like there\u2019s more going on here.", "Because he was going to watch her", "But it could also be that she wanted time to spend time with her friends without worrying about entertaining him.

He doesnt like not knowing who she is with or how long.\n\nWe all know he would be impossing his presence to whatever she wants to do. Including if she feels like hanging with her school friends the day before or after.\n\nLooking at this writing, I can't blame her for wanting a weekend off.", "I read that differently.  My thinking was she said stay home and relax and he took it as shutting him down.  He seems too needy.

I think that the hosts were so rude to say \u201chad a huge list, your husband didn\u2019t make the cut\u201d.

Moreover, when you\u2019re married to someone and they say \u201ci\u2019m not comfortable with this\u201d, you need to put your spouse first and respect that (particularly if this is a rare issue). Also - another factor that would make me feel annoyed due to my personal circumstances is that my partner and I get very few weekends together. We\u2019re just so busy with our careers and weekend trips are such a rarity (we haven\u2019t had a vacation trip in years, and have only been able to take about two short long weekend trips a year).

Being alone really isn\u2019t a reason either, women are not some fragile creatures who need a protector. Nor is being invited alone, just because they haven\u2019t heard of one from a couple being invited doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve definitely heard of it happening. \n\nThere is also nothings saying he explained why, all he told her was he was uncomfortable according to this post, unless you are just referring to the post itself, tho from the more mention in your second paragraph I think not, the wife clearly listened and according to the post all he said was he was uncomfortable with her going alone, then mentioned fishing with dad, got shot down(which I\u2019ll admit without more context seems strange if it\u2019s a yearly thing already), then argued with her until he got heated enough for him to say something horrible as a simple wedding trip would cause a deep rift. Yea no. HE would cause the rift. \n\nThere is absolutely no indication she didn\u2019t care, why do people always act like the only way a woman can show she cares is be fully giving in and doing what the man wants? You know what\u2019s actually disheartening in a 10 year marriage? A dude being insecure over his literal wife of ten years being around her exs. That\u2019s honestly ridiculous and kinda disgusting, (not of course counting if she has a history of cheating, but then wtf is op with her for still? As for the compromise, nah. That\u2019s him trying to be a chaperone, if he can\u2019t go fishing then he would prob be all up in her shit making it about him.

In a healthy relationship consideration should be taken for both people. To make a decision based solely on what you want with no regard to your partners feelings is disrespectful.

Personally I think they should have discussed this a long time ago but apparently they have not and it needs to be addressed now.

I\u2019m sure if she comes out smiling or slightly tipsy he will hate that too.", "well you know why you're single", "And being a dick to the partner you supposedly love is going to end up with you without a partner if they aren\u2019t as controlling as you\u2019re projecting.", "Not really a sacrifice when he plan to go on a fishing trip with his FIL. \nHow can that be a big sacrifice to have your husband in the same state as you ?", "Big sacrifices like... Letting your husband come have a fishing trip with your father, far away from the wedding?", "It\u2019s absolutely not a stupid reason to say \u201cif my husband isn\u2019t invited I\u2019m not going\u201d and you see it happen ALL THE TIME where the invited spouse turns down an invite. This is the first time in 10 years he\u2019s said he\u2019s uncomfortable with someone and the reason is valid.", "Or they didn\u2019t? Lol some big weddings, the newly weds do not get around to EVERYONE. And if they had it in the budget for plus ones, fine. But this couple clearly doesn\u2019t.", "But only girls trips, because mixed genders can\u2019t be friends apparently.", "Whoa this guy is the most non possessive guy out there.", "And what do they see there?", "Yeah exactly. My husband wouldn't dream of being this pushy if I wanted to be alone. I mean we love being together and doing stuff together. 9/10 I'll chose him but sometimes I want my friends and so does he.", "This", "agreed. I hate weddings.

Was it really that big of a problem if he went and did his own thing? There was no reasoning or care for OPs feelings at all. Just shut down, no. Don\u2019t care about your feelings on the matter, get over it.\n\nIt was already a weird situation not being invited as a spouse. Not that it justifies but the mind tends to run when ppl are hurt. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d feel great if my SO started feeling this way about a situation, but I would at least try and understand and go from there.", "In my opinion, if she doesn\u2019t care enough about her high school friend to invite her husband, then she shouldn\u2019t invite her at all.\n\nPeople can flay etiquette, but it\u2019s rude and will offend people. I hate this modern trend of using costs to justify egregious etiquette guffaws.", "She's not sitting around twirling her mustache while laughing about her nefarious plan.\n\nBut even unintentionally she is being disrespectful.", "They do know op.  For at least 10 years.  From when they were both at his wedding.", "This is objectively untrue. There are some pretty well accepted rules of etiquette for weddings and one of them is if you\u2019re inviting someone who\u2019s married that invitation includes their spouse. Especially if you were at their wedding.", "It's not even a +1 in this case, it's a known spouse - they were at OP's freaking wedding.", "I hide behind kids. I find the nearest one and ask them to tell me about their toys/friends/games.

At this point, they aren't friends at all anymore. I wouldn't care at all if my husband went to a wedding alone for a couple that I met a couple times ten years ago. I wouldn't have cared or been surprised that I wasn't invited, especially after finding out that it was due to such a large guest list.", "There were people at my wedding I didn't know, and never saw again, because they were +1's.  The fact they attended his wedding due to knowing the bride says nothing about how well OP knows them.", "They know his wife well enough to have been to their wedding. Maybe OP and wife had funds for a bigger wedding, and were able to invite friends only one of them knew. We don't know if OP has even talked with the friend himself in the past 10 years.", "I had multiple people at my wedding I had never met before and haven\u2019t met since. They were my husband\u2019s guests, not mine, and don\u2019t live close by. I don\u2019t know why you would think that them being at the wedding means OP knows them. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the decision of no plus one to a spouse, but I had multiple people at my wedding that I didn\u2019t get to go to theirs due to small weddings.", "They know his wife well enough to be invited. That doesn't by any means indicate they know him at all. I see a cousin at most family get togethers but have met her husband exactly once - at their wedding.", "When two people get married, many of the guests will be friends of one or the other. Sometimes they don't know their new spouses' friends. It's perfectly normal.", "Right? Like the fact that the wife was okay with the husband not being invited when the friend was at their wedding is not okay. The couple made a huge faux pas inviting half a married couple and this is the fall out that ensues. They should have not invited the wife if they didn't invite the spouse.", "And i admit that i understood that they still had time because i feel like you plan a wedding a long time in advance, especially if it requires invited people to travel for it. So it might be some of my bias here. If they do have time, my first comment stand, it changes if they don't have time. But tbh this post should be the start of their communication and not the end of it", "lol right? people on this sub are wild.", "This is Reddit.\n\nDivorce, NC are the only solutions there are.", "Sometimes people deserve to be called out. If my husband whined like this on a regular basis to try and manipulate me out of doing things, we quite simply wouldn't be married much longer. \n\nYour feelings are your feelings to deal with, if you're not acting like an adult and don't feel like you can, talk with your therapist, don't try to control what I do to make your feelings better.

When men are insecure they're called controlling. \n\nKinda like when women stand up for themselves they're often labeled bossy.", "We're clearly missing information about why she doesn't want him to go fishing with her dad. Seems like neither of them stand to lose or gain anything, and people don't \"shut down\" shit like that for no reason.", "But I don't think it's about the fishing. They'd likely be staying together, so she'd be grilled in the morning about what she's doing that day and grilled at night about what she did. \n\n\nIf she mentions that she and her friends are going to a certain restaurant, would he show up?\n\n\nI divorced my ex for less controlling behavior than what's happening here.", "It's great to love your spouse, but it's also perfectly okay to not always have to have them tag along as your date. She's excited about her childhood friend getting married, and she wants to see her old friends.

His reasons are not valid.", "It's fine to choose not to go _yourself_ for that reason. It's stupid to demand your _partner_ not go.\n\nIn no sense is his upset \"valid.\" Hard YTA.", "His wife leaving him", "I would try also. But the fishing idea was after all the other crap he said, wasn't it? So it's clear that he doesn't want to fish, he just doesn't want her there without him nearby. Chaperoning, keeping tabs, guilting her when she hasn't come back to the hotel when he thinks she should, being too busy to text him. \n\nHe sounds unlikeable to me. Valid feelings to start, and he turned into a controlling, possessive jerk.", "god I wish I had a mustache to twirl... I feel like it would really add to my gravitas", "Just like it's happening in OP's wife case I suppose, if she attends the wedding she may know the bride but not the groom (or vice versa), they might not be friends but she's still excited for her friend's marriage.

I'm surprised by the answers. Everyone is harping on him being possessive, when in reality it's super shitty to leave your husband behind if he isn't invited. If a \"friend\" didn't invite my husband to a wedding then I'd tell them to count me out too. I've been married almost a decade.", "because it's obvious he only suggested it in response to her being invited to the wedding. so he can still 'go' with her without directly going with her. I wouldn't play into his odd insecurities either, and I hope my own partner would call me out if I was being that ridiculous too", "It's just possible that she was looking forward to spending some time on her own. \n\nOP does seem a little bit clingy (ahem) and some alone time is nice and important in a long term relationship.", "Because the idea probably came up in the midst of a conversation where it was apparent that he only suggested it because he doesn't trust her to go alone without him supervising.  He doesn't REALLY want to go fishing with her dad.  He wants to be close by to keep an eye on her with all these ex's around.  She's not stupid, she gets his actual motive.", "Possibly she wanted to feel free to go to wedding adjacent events without her husband insisting on tagging along, potentially making a scene about his not being invited. Also not wanting to spend the entire time travelling with him giving her shit about going on her own. Because if he's badgering her about it now, I doubt he'd stop. I can't blame her for not wanting to put herself or her friend in the position of letting OP confront the bride about the lack of plus one invite.", "Less controlling behavior than all of the assumptions you're making about how OP might behave?", "Friends that are so close and excited to see her\u2026 that they told her she can\u2019t bring her husband.\n\nYa, sounds like a group they\u2019re really close to.  Sorry, when you get married, life becomes \u2018we\u2019 vs \u2018me\u2019.  I\u2019ve never heard of an invite specifically stating a spouse can\u2019t be brought along.  It\u2019s disrespectful", "I mean, yeah, I like my spouse enough that if I\u2019m traveling out of state, I want them with me. You don\u2019t?", "That isn\u2019t how a relationship works. If you ignore your husband telling you for the first time in 10+ years \u201cI\u2019m not okay with this\u201d, don\u2019t expect the marriage to stay the same.", "I agree...and maybe it's immature of me, but I think if my husband reacted with jealousy about childhood exes, I'd make it a point to go alone just because I'm an adult and I know I don't cheat. My husband of ten years should definitely know that too. If there was a history of suspect behavior or cheating on her part, OP would have mentioned it. There was nothing, so why bring up the exes?", "And so quick to ascribe the very worst traits to everyone.\n\nIn this case, OOP is obviously insecure about this trip and expressed as much to his wife of 10 years.\n\nNow he's a controlling abusive stalker.\n\nI'll admit he sounds a bit whiny, and is definitely insecure but it's a big jump from feeling left out because you were purposely left out of an event and your wife and her ex's were included.....to abusing your wife.\n\nAs an aside.... I wonder if these friends never liked OOP and his relationship to his wife, which is why he's more worried about this solo invite.", "The worst part is OP isn't even asking she not go, they offered a more than fair compromise that doesn't prevent the wife from attending, but does make OP feel more comfortable. Why is OP's comfort less important than the wife's excuses? She would still be attending, nothing about her presence has changed, only OPs comfort level with the arrangement", "\u201cHusband of 10 years is uncomfortable with something? Fuck him, I\u2019m gonna power play this shit\u201d \n\nChrist. I hope you never marry.", "Most of my trips are with my partner. Some of them are not.

We don't know if it's true or not. \n\nThis is the same man who claimed he isn't possessive while acting incredibly possessive.", "Preach. People always project the worst in this sub. They make up these vile backstories for everyone to justify their hate.", "Oh, they\u2019ll marry \u2026 four or five times, because they won\u2019t know how to STAY married.", "Sure, as long as both partners are cool with it. One isn\u2019t here. Again, first time in 10+ years. Making this out to be codependency is either intentionally misleading or means you don\u2019t understand codependency. He offered a compromise to let her go alone with him traveling with her and made him comfortable. That\u2019s pretty normal.", "I\u2019m implying there\u2019s no valid reason for her to have turned down the compromise of \u201chow about I go with you and me and your dad can do our annual fishing trip while you\u2019re at the wedding\u201d, yeah.\n\nLike I said, I like my partner enough that if I\u2019m traveling out of state I want them there, especially if they want to go and do something with my family as well.", "Just because it's \"pretty normal\" for you doesn't mean it isn't codependency. \n\nThat's not her going alone, that's him coming along as a babysitter because he's insecure about her high-school exes. \n\nHe's only wanting to come because he doesn't trust her, not because he wants to spend time with her or make sure she's safe travelling, but because for some reason he doesn't trust her around people that she dated in high-school over a decade ago.", "I also suspect that her shutting down the compromise may have something to do with how the offer was presented.\n\n\"*No +1's invited? Darn, that sucks, but hey how about we both travel to the state together and I visit your parents? Would be nice to see them again*.\"\n\nis very different from \n\n\"I *don't want you to go alone. You don't care? Okay well how about I join you anyways and wait for you at your parents' until you're done*.\"", "That's great *for you.* OP came at this from a controlling angle and she's likely pushing back on that because he's trying to shoehorn a reason to babysit her on this trip. It's not about spending time together because you like each other, it's about the motivation of wanting to supervise his wife during this trip because he's clearly worried about infidelity."]}
