Over that time, we\u2019ve been to over a dozen weddings of our respective friends and family. The invitations have always been addressed to both of us as a married couple. Many times I\u2019ve gone to her friends\u2019 weddings where I only know 1 or 2 people and she\u2019s been in the same situation with my friends\u2019 weddings. We\u2019ve always made new acquaintances and had great times.\n\nLast month she received a wedding invitation from an old high school friend. The problem is that it was address to only her and didn\u2019t mention me or a plus one. We know that this friend knows we\u2019re married as they attended our wedding. We thought this was an oversight so she called her friends and was told that they had a huge list of people and had to cut down the list and I didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nI\u2019ve never heard of one married partner being invited to a wedding without the other. I asked my large group of friends and family and no one has ever heard of such a thing. The other part that makes me feel uncomfortable is that the wedding is in her home state so she\u2019ll be flying back there alone. Lastly, 3 of her ex\u2019s will be in attendance because they used to be part of the same friends group. 1 from HS and 2 from college.\n\nI know I\u2019m sounding very possessive but I promise I\u2019m not. My wife sometimes goes out with her girlfriends and have even gone on a couple of girls only vacation and I\u2019ve never had a problem before. However, I find this entire situation to be weird.\n\nLast night as she was looking for her airline ticket, I told her I was uncomfortable with her going without me. She said I wouldn\u2019t have fun as I won\u2019t know anyone there and that she\u2019ll be busy catching up with old friends. Then I suggested I come back to that state and go fishing with her father as he and I usually take a fishing trip once a year together. She shut that idea down immediately and said I should stay home and relax. I don\u2019t know if it was because I was already uneasy with the trip but it felt like she didn\u2019t want me anywhere near the state.\n\nAfter some back and forth, I told her I am very uncomfortable with the entire thing and that started a heated discussion where I ended it by telling her she shouldn\u2019t go and if she does this will cause a deep rift between us. I\u2019ve never said those words before so I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m an AH right now.", "created_utc": 1685616679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xecxg/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_shouldnt_go_to_a/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't even want her to be in a different state without you being in the vicinity? But you're not being possessive...\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been married for ten years and you\u2019re worried about her college and her HS exes? Sounds like you don\u2019t trust your wife. \n\nYour wife is an adult and can do things without you. She can travel without you. She doesn\u2019t need to revolve her life around your insecurities.", "YTA\n\n>I know I\u2019m sounding very possessive but I promise I\u2019m not.\n\n'I'm not being possessive, but I don't want my fully-grown adult wife flying back to her home state alone to attend a wedding and if she does I'm going to blame her for my reaction to it'.\n\nYou *are* being possessive - worryingly so. Your wife should be able to take a fight and go to a wedding alone without you kicking off like this. You are basically telling her that you don't trust her and that she needs to be accompanied by you to make sure she's going to behave herself.\n\n>I ended it by telling her she shouldn\u2019t go and if she does this will cause a deep rift between us.\n\nNo. YOUR trust issues are going to cause the 'deep rift' between you and I really recommend you deal with them before you push your wife away.", "INFO: Why are you uncomfortable with her traveling back to her hometown alone? And if you are not going to the wedding, what is the point of accompanying her on the trip?", "For me, the red flag in this scenario is her absolute reluctance in your going with her at all. Stay home and relax instead of fishing with her dad? Why? Why did she shut that down so quickly when it\u2019s an activity you do with her dad annually? \n\nHow long will she be gone? Why is she so insistent you don\u2019t go at all? If the friend getting married attended your wedding and you have an existing friendship with them, why is a *spouse* being cut from the invite list? \n\nYes, some of your actions/comments make you seem possessive, but after 10 years of marriage her behavior is a bit suspect. This wedding is also costing you and your wife money - plane ticket, lodging (unless she\u2019s staying with her family), likely dinners out\u2026 I\u2019m assuming shared finances here, of course. \n\nIf my husband were to be solo invited to a wedding, he would RSVP a hard no. NTA.", "So the Reddit crowd is going to just call you an AH and to be honest you are sounding a bit insecure. While you may be the AH here I know if I spoke to my wife about feeling uncomfortable about her going alone she would not go out of respect for me and our relationship as that is much more important than an old friends wedding. One thing she would not do is dismiss my feelings on the matter which is what it sounds like may be happening in your post. I guess a big question you need to ask yourself is do you trust your wife? I don\u2019t know anything more about your relationship than what you typed but it sounds to me like you do not trust her. Now the only question here is if she has given you a reason not to trust her because if not  then yea your TA and you guys should probably talk about your insecurities.", "INFO: Do either of you go on solo trips? Or do you insist on doing everything together?", "YTA. Yeah, it was rude for the couple not to invite you. But you\u2019re using it as an excuse to be extremely weird and controlling. She\u2019s not trying to keep you away from the state, she\u2019s trying to prevent you from following her to this wedding like she\u2019s a teenager and you\u2019re her chaperone. Just stop.", "Flying with her and going fishing with your FIL sounds like a nice compromise.\n\nUnless your wife is worried that you won\u2019t actually go fishing, and you will secretly pack your wedding attire and insist on going to the wedding *anyway*, not invited, and make a scene. ESH", "YTA you\u2019re coming off as controlling and immature. But it seems this is more of a case of you feeling miffed by the perceived slight, and you want to protest rather than allow your wife some time to enjoy herself with old friends. Don\u2019t be so selfish.", "YTA. Yes, it is weird to be invited, but do you trust her? If she wants to go alone, let her go? Or are there other problems between you two. If you already said that there are exes, you don't trust her. It is normal to have some trips separately.", "YTA\n\nI think you should really consider the notion that she's going alone because you're being overbearing and possessive. I also think you should do some work on your insecurities. That's what's causing the rift, not her going to visit some old friends by herself. What she's doing is perfectly normal.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s very rude to only invite one half of a married couple that\u2019s been together for a decade+. It\u2019s weird that your wife sees no issue with you being snubbed but I could look past that as she just wants to see her old friends and is willing to allow them to exclude you to do so. I can also understand your apprehension and the multiple ex\u2019s is just icing on the cake.\n\nWhat makes its bizarre and tips it from N A H to NTA for me is her automatic and immediate shut down of you being anywhere near this wedding. Why can\u2019t you fly out there with her and just go fishing with her dad that weekend? Why does she not want you anywhere near this wedding? That\u2019s kinda sketchy. If she can\u2019t give you a good reason why she doesn\u2019t want you around *at all* then I would dig my heels in about this.", "YTA. Not possessive yet you want to be in the same state at least? Yeah op very telling. Whilst the No plus one was a bit weird from her friends, it\u2019s her friends wedding. And you are being extremely controlling. Get over yourself op and let your wife live", "NTA . You offered a very good compromise to go fishing with her dad, and she turned you down flat.  That is a little weird to me. Ask her why she is so against you going. I'm guessing she wants to bust loose and party with your friends, but for you not to see it.", "YTA. It\u2019s not unusual to only invite 1 person if you\u2019re on a budget and numbers are tight. How are you not being possessive seriously what is your problem you don\u2019t have to do everything together! You\u2019ve been married for 10 years you seriously have an issue with her exes?! You are being controlling cut that shit out now, telling her it will cause problems in your relationship?! Yeah you TA. A few days apart is hardly a big deal.", "YTA\n\nI would be perfectly fine with my husband going to a wedding of a highschool friend without me.\n\nIf it was a mutual friend that we were equally close to, I\u2019d definitely be hurt if only one of us were invited. \n\nBut someone he went to school with, that I barely know? Doesn\u2019t bother me at all. Weddings are expensive. I\u2019d hate for the getting-married-couple being forced to miss out on having someone they\u2019re *actually close to* at the wedding, just so they could have me there as a +1 to my husband. \n\nAs for exes being there\u2026what does that have to do with anything? If your wife is trustworthy, it doesn\u2019t matter who is there. If she\u2019s not trustworthy, you have a bigger issue than a solo wedding invite. (Also, what is it you would expect to change if you were there? You going to spend all night glaring daggers at the exes, or possessively holding her hand so they don\u2019t forget she\u2019s taken?)", "NTA they are being rude to you. I wouldn\u2019t go if my husband wasn\u2019t invited.", "NTA. She\u2019s dismissing you\u2019re feelings so she can go and do whatever she wants guilt free. And she will do whatever she wants.", "YTA for issuing a kind of ultimatum. That's not okay, no matter what your feelings are. That's manipulative. \n\nI personally don't see an issue, but I can understand why others do. If your wife has not given you any reasons to be suspicious or not trust her, you've voiced your opinions and now it's time for you to deal with your own feelings about her decision. \n\nWhy can't you just.... Enjoy the time to yourself and let her enjoy a few days seeing old friends? Absence makes the heart grow fonder, or so I hear. You could plan a nice evening for when she gets home.", "YTA. I don't think it's unheard of to not invite plus-ones (even spouses) when space is limited and the \"extras\" aren't also friends of the couple getting married. Plus it's not going to hurt your marriage to go on separate adventures sometimes. Why not take advantage of the opportunity and plan a fun weekend for yourself featuring activities that you wouldn't ordinarily do with your wife? Get some buddies together and go fishing, or go to one of those places that lets you drive a racing car, or find the best restaurant in the region for some sort of food you love that your wife isn't keen on, or make a minigolf course in your garage and hold an after-dark tournament, or hop on a plane to visit a friend you haven't caught up with in ages - the possibilities are endless! I hope you're both able to have a fabulous time apart for a few days, which will make coming home to each other all the sweeter. \ud83c\udf37", "YTA. It's okay to have friends and interests outside of your significant other.", "YTA. It was very rude and completely wrong of the couple not to invite you.  But your wife is an adult and decides for herself if she wants to go or not.  I would also be hurt that my partner wasn\u2019t sticking up for me but attempting to control her is wrong.", "NTA, why can\u2019t you go and make a chill weekend  with her dad and hangout with her after,weird that she\u2019s so specific she doesn\u2019t want you near at all.", "1. She should have sent her regrets when her spouse wasn\u2019t invited. \n2. She is adamantly opposed to you being near the event.\n\nYou are right to see red flags.\n\nI would be upset too.", "YTA. You're the one causing a rift in the marriage.", "YTA for taking out your hurt from this couple out on your wife. She is a whole adult and can go if she wants", "YTA - this person is not your friend. It is your wife\u2019s friend. It\u2019s okay to feel some sort of way about being excluded, but this comes down to being a small wedding and you didn\u2019t make the cut for an invite. Why punish your wife for that? Stop blaming her, stop making insinuations, and chill.", "YTA. How did you type this out and not see that?!", "Both NTA and YTA.  NTA for being peeved at not being invited.  But for a once probably never happening again time, could you let it slide?\n\nYTA for the exs comment.  She married you.  Not them.

Your wife should\u2019ve declined the invitation out of respect for you and that goes without saying.", "It sucks to not get invited. But some people can only afford so much for a venue and fit so many people in.
