Family approval means relationships a lot easier \n\nThat being said, you probably could have done a better job striking a balance between talking to her grandmother and hanging out with her during the party.  It's hard to fault her based on your description of events.", "NAH but apologize. Tell her you got on so well with her grandmother you didn't realize you were ignoring her and say you're sorry for not giving her enough attention on her birthday. I'm not saying you were wrong, but you inadvertently hurt your gf so just say you're sorry and move on.  You could argue that you did nothing wrong but then you're arguing and this is such a small misunderstanding of expectations (in a fairly new relationship), don't make it into a big drama.", "You connected with the matriarch of the family\n\nThat will pay dividends down the road\n\nBut it also sounds like you maybe ignored everyone at the party...including your girlfriend, because you got caught up with the grandmother.\n\nSo for now, just acknowledge that yes...you should have paid more attention to your girlfriend and the other party guests...and that you just got excited being able to speak your native language and talk to someone who grew up where you grew up\n\nMaybe then take her out for a second birthday....Nothing fancy.  Maybe just desert and a stroll around a park at sunset.  Something where you can just focus 100% of your attention on her and how you feel about her.\n\nThere are times to be defiant and tell your partner they are being immature or insecure....and there are times where you just accept that \"yeah, I probably could have done a better job\"\n\nI think this is one of those times where just acknowledging her feelings on the matter and letting her know you hear her and will do better in the future.  And then you do better.\n\nFor most people, that is all they want out of situations like this.  An acknowledgement that their feelings are valid and a respectful resolution to the issue.  Sadly, most people just can't seem to do that.  Which is why so many relationships turn toxic.\n\nNAH", "INFO: did you just sit with the grandma for hours and not really connect with other friends family members?", "I really thought I was about to read that he found out they were 2nd cousins or something", "NAH\n\nThis is just a situation you need to learn from. I don't think you are necessarily an AH here. It is important to pay attention to the birthday person at any celebration but especially if you are their SO.\n\nAnother thing, it can be very difficult to stop 2 people in deep conversation so they may have been distressed but not confident enough to mention at the time to you.\n\nSay you're sorry and next event you will aim to spend more time focused on them.\n\nI had a similar situation when dating someone, we went to a party and I saw a friend there who I hadn't seen in like a decade, we used to play sports and hang out a lot in secondary school. We spent a while catching up with each other and before we knew it turns out we had been speaking just ourselves over an hour. This was despite me ignoring the hints from my partner that we should go and get another drink. :) I apologised and we moved on.", "NAH.  \n\nYou were understandably excited to talk to grandma.  Girlfriend knew your history and it should have occurred to her that you and grandma would want to talk.  However, your girlfriend was also understandably excited for a milestone birthday, and you knew it.   She's probably wondering if she's going to be ignored by you at every big event.\n\nNeither of you behaved ideally, but I don't believe there was actual malice or intent on either side.  You're *both* pretty young and maybe a little self-centered (different from selfish), which is why I didn't go with N T A or E S H.  Use this as a learning experiencce, and communicate better with your girlfriend.", "I would personally be charmed if my partner got on so well with my grandmother and spoke to her all night in her first language. I\u2019m old though so maybe I expect different things from a partner than a freshly minted adult does. A partner who engages with my family and makes them feel important and special is lovely. And honestly, I would also be so delighted to see my partner happy talking about their home and getting the chance to speak to someone who understands them in their language of origin. \n\nPerhaps try to express how meaningful it was to you and see if she gets it. NTA", "NAH. When I lived in France as a teenager and didn\u2019t speak my native language for the better part of a year, I couldn\u2019t believe how excited I got when I met someone from the UK and I could suddenly fully express myself with language again. I\u2019m not even from the UK so it\u2019s not like we had a shared cultural background, just the literal fact of speaking my native language for a bit felt amazing. So I totally understand why you got carried away and spent the whole party with grandma.\n\nBut you should definitely apologize, because it is kind of crappy to invite someone to your birthday party and have them ignore you\u2014even unintentionally. Just explain that you got carried away, maybe plan a special afternoon or dinner or whatever for just the two of you, and be more mindful in the future if you go to any more family events. You didn\u2019t do your gf any actual harm, so don\u2019t grovel or let yourself feel guilty after you apologize.", "NAH\n\nSeems like more of a problem with expectations. You were understandably prioritizing learning more  about your heritage. The problem is your girlfriend probably wanted to introduce you to friends/family.  A lot of marriage is simply understanding and apologizing for accidental hurt feelings. This seems like one of those.", "NTA\n\nHanging out with her grandmother at her birthday party is actually kind of sweet. It seems like a perfectly natural and organic social interaction.", "NTA. Just talk to her about it and explain what you explained in the post. It\u2019s understandable that she feels hurt. As you didn\u2019t do it on purpose though, just talking it out is probably the best course of action", "NTA.  Personally I would be delighted if my partner was able to make that type of connection with a family member.  Your gf should have approached you at the party if she needed more attention from you. I suppose you could have made an attempt to approach her as well just to check in.   But really- it\u2019s kit like you met grandma and just latched on, making small talk to pass the time.  You were deeply engaged in a meaningful discussion which I imagine was emotional ( happy/exciting/nostalgic/etc).  \n\nGive her a big hug today.  Tell her you\u2019re sorry time escaped you and then explain how wonderful it was meeting and talking with her grandma.  And that you\u2019re looking forward to more social gatherings so you can get to know her other family and friends as well.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s lovely you had such a nice time talking to her grandmother. If I were your girlfriend, I\u2019d be happy you enjoyed getting to know her.", "NTA - she should have been happy you connected with someone important in her family.", "NTA, very understandable scenario, and you were connecting with her grandmother and reconnecting with your roots. I think it's lovely, and I think she will come around.", "NTA - Although I can see how she might feel neglected or not made to feel special. I think ignoring is a strong word to use here. You were connecting with her grandmother. If it were me, I'd be ecstatic that my significant other sat and chatted with my grandparents instead of sitting on their phone or getting drunk and sloppy at a party. \n\nApologize because I can see how she may have hurt feelings but you're not the asshole in the situation.", "NTA. She had lots of attention.", "NTA. She should haver expressed it during the party not after if she wanted you to spend more time with her. You're not a mind reader.\n\nEdit: Also, you weren't ignoring her, you were just chatting with her grandma who would have definetely been ignored otherwise. I'm sure you made her day special! I hope your gf gonna realise this soon.", "It's all good. Grandma loves him now, so he's in like flint. The GF will get over it.", "NTA - I will prep myself for the downvotes... but your GF was sort of TA.\n\nOf course you would go to her birthday party, was it really fair of her to leave you in a situation where you only knew her and her family? No, not really. Luckily you hit it off with her grandmother and had a great time. She got to party with her friends and the rest of her family. \n\nIf she wanted more of your attention, she could have used her words. I'm sure her grandmother wouldn't have minded her borrowing you for a dance or two.", "NTA. My birthday was yesterday too actually- not relevant though. \n\nI feel she\u2019s overreacting. Everyone was there for HER, so you being by her side the entire time shouldn\u2019t have been necessary. I\u2019d be damn happy my bf got close to my gma! Hopefully she\u2019ll calm down.", "NTA\n\nI think it's sweet that you connected so much with her grandmother and I'm surprised she is upset by it rather than enamoured.", "How lovely to have connected with her grandmother. You\u2019re NTA for that. It must feel wonderful to have someone from \u201chome.\u201d\n\nThere is a little bit AH energy in regard to tuning out your gf. You were there for the big moments, but I can understand if she felt a little hurt.\n\nBut she should move on! If I had a bf who so connected with my grandmother, I\u2019d be thrilled.", "Gonna go against the grain and say YTA if she had to pull you away to do pics or cake that should've been your hint to spend some time with her. It's nice you connected with her grandmother but she probably wanted her boyfriend to also be drinking, dancing, and talking to her and her friends at her 21st birthday. Going off to speak to a grandma in a language she can't understand for hours straight is not exactly normal party behavior. \n\nI think your intentions were good but you should apologize and try to be more mindful of how you split up your time especially at an event in your partners honor.", "NTA. It was your first time meeting her family, she should have expected you to spend a lot of time socializing with them rather than her as that\u2019s generally how you get to know people. Also, if she wanted to spend more time with you at the party she should politely have said something then.", "NTA", "NAH. \n\nParty likely sucked, and you spent it with the coolest lady in the room while your GF dealt with the rif raff. \n\nShould you have been more attentive, maybe. But it's not your fault that you happened to meet the few cool people at a party and stick with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not her accessory and she should be comfortable to have you in the same place, but not need to constantly be at her side. The fact that she expects so much attention from you is a problem.", "This seems to me to be the only reasonable answer. Apologise for accidentally hurting her and learn from this.\n\n\nBut I can hardly call OP an ah if they just got carried away and genuinely thought the gf was having a fun time with her friends.\n\n\nMiscommunications happen sometimes. Just communicate more, no one is an ah here.", "Agreed, but he should\u2019ve split his time a little better because I can see where she felt like he didn\u2019t want to be with her and he was just doing the other things because he had to. I understand though grandma is very important.\n\nMaybe talk to her about it and asked to go see her again so you can sit down with just her grandma. If this is a committed relationship this is a good way to get it going. You will have many opportunities to sit with her. I see that you were excited but it was your girlfriends day and you could\u2019ve spent more time with the girlfriend too.NAH", "^^Solid advice here, OP.", "NAH\n\nabsolutely do this please", "I am also curious"]}
