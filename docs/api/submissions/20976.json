It's hard to fault her based on your description of events.", "NAH but apologize. Tell her you got on so well with her grandmother you didn't realize you were ignoring her and say you're sorry for not giving her enough attention on her birthday. I'm not saying you were wrong, but you inadvertently hurt your gf so just say you're sorry and move on.  You could argue that you did nothing wrong but then you're arguing and this is such a small misunderstanding of expectations (in a fairly new relationship), don't make it into a big drama.", "You connected with the matriarch of the family\n\nThat will pay dividends down the road\n\nBut it also sounds like you maybe ignored everyone at the party...including your girlfriend, because you got caught up with the grandmother.\n\nSo for now, just acknowledge that yes...you should have paid more attention to your girlfriend and the other party guests...and that you just got excited being able to speak your native language and talk to someone who grew up where you grew up\n\nMaybe then take her out for a second birthday....Nothing fancy.  Maybe just desert and a stroll around a park at sunset.  Something where you can just focus 100% of your attention on her and how you feel about her.\n\nThere are times to be defiant and tell your partner they are being immature or insecure....and there are times where you just accept that \"yeah, I probably could have done a better job\"\n\nI think this is one of those times where just acknowledging her feelings on the matter and letting her know you hear her and will do better in the future.  And then you do better.\n\nFor most people, that is all they want out of situations like this.  An acknowledgement that their feelings are valid and a respectful resolution to the issue.  Sadly, most people just can't seem to do that.  Which is why so many relationships turn toxic.\n\nNAH", "INFO: did you just sit with the grandma for hours and not really connect with other friends family members?", "I really thought I was about to read that he found out they were 2nd cousins or something", "NAH\n\nThis is just a situation you need to learn from. I don't think you are necessarily an AH here. It is important to pay attention to the birthday person at any celebration but especially if you are their SO.\n\nAnother thing, it can be very difficult to stop 2 people in deep conversation so they may have been distressed but not confident enough to mention at the time to you.\n\nSay you're sorry and next event you will aim to spend more time focused on them.\n\nI had a similar situation when dating someone, we went to a party and I saw a friend there who I hadn't seen in like a decade, we used to play sports and hang out a lot in secondary school. We spent a while catching up with each other and before we knew it turns out we had been speaking just ourselves over an hour. This was despite me ignoring the hints from my partner that we should go and get another drink. :) I apologised and we moved on.", "NAH.  \n\nYou were understandably excited to talk to grandma.  Girlfriend knew your history and it should have occurred to her that you and grandma would want to talk.  However, your girlfriend was also understandably excited for a milestone birthday, and you knew it.   She's probably wondering if she's going to be ignored by you at every big event.\n\nNeither of you behaved ideally, but I don't believe there was actual malice or intent on either side.  You're *both* pretty young and maybe a little self-centered (different from selfish), which is why I didn't go with N T A or E S H.  Use this as a learning experiencce, and communicate better with your girlfriend.", "I would personally be charmed if my partner got on so well with my grandmother and spoke to her all night in her first language. I\u2019m old though so maybe I expect different things from a partner than a freshly minted adult does. A partner who engages with my family and makes them feel important and special is lovely. And honestly, I would also be so delighted to see my partner happy talking about their home and getting the chance to speak to someone who understands them in their language of origin. \n\nPerhaps try to express how meaningful it was to you and see if she gets it. NTA", "NAH. When I lived in France as a teenager and didn\u2019t speak my native language for the better part of a year, I couldn\u2019t believe how excited I got when I met someone from the UK and I could suddenly fully express myself with language again. I\u2019m not even from the UK so it\u2019s not like we had a shared cultural background, just the literal fact of speaking my native language for a bit felt amazing. So I totally understand why you got carried away and spent the whole party with grandma.\n\nBut you should definitely apologize, because it is kind of crappy to invite someone to your birthday party and have them ignore you\u2014even unintentionally. Just explain that you got carried away, maybe plan a special afternoon or dinner or whatever for just the two of you, and be more mindful in the future if you go to any more family events. You didn\u2019t do your gf any actual harm, so don\u2019t grovel or let yourself feel guilty after you apologize.", "NAH\n\nSeems like more of a problem with expectations. You were understandably prioritizing learning more  about your heritage. The problem is your girlfriend probably wanted to introduce you to friends/family.  A lot of marriage is simply understanding and apologizing for accidental hurt feelings. This seems like one of those.", "NTA\n\nHanging out with her grandmother at her birthday party is actually kind of sweet. It seems like a perfectly natural and organic social interaction.", "NTA. Just talk to her about it and explain what you explained in the post. It\u2019s understandable that she feels hurt. As you didn\u2019t do it on purpose though, just talking it out is probably the best course of action", "NTA.  Personally I would be delighted if my partner was able to make that type of connection with a family member.  Your gf should have approached you at the party if she needed more attention from you. I suppose you could have made an attempt to approach her as well just to check in.   But really- it\u2019s kit like you met grandma and just latched on, making small talk to pass the time.  You were deeply engaged in a meaningful discussion which I imagine was emotional ( happy/exciting/nostalgic/etc).  \n\nGive her a big hug today.  Tell her you\u2019re sorry time escaped you and then explain how wonderful it was meeting and talking with her grandma.  And that you\u2019re looking forward to more social gatherings so you can get to know her other family and friends as well.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s lovely you had such a nice time talking to her grandmother. If I were your girlfriend, I\u2019d be happy you enjoyed getting to know her.", "NTA - she should have been happy you connected with someone important in her family.", "NTA, very understandable scenario, and you were connecting with her grandmother and reconnecting with your roots. I think it's lovely, and I think she will come around.", "NTA - Although I can see how she might feel neglected or not made to feel special. I think ignoring is a strong word to use here. You were connecting with her grandmother. If it were me, I'd be ecstatic that my significant other sat and chatted with my grandparents instead of sitting on their phone or getting drunk and sloppy at a party. \n\nApologize because I can see how she may have hurt feelings but you're not the asshole in the situation.", "NTA. She had lots of attention.", "NTA. She should haver expressed it during the party not after if she wanted you to spend more time with her. You're not a mind reader.\n\nEdit: Also, you weren't ignoring her, you were just chatting with her grandma who would have definetely been ignored otherwise. I'm sure you made her day special! I hope your gf gonna realise this soon.", "It's all good. Grandma loves him now, so he's in like flint. The GF will get over it.", "NTA - I will prep myself for the downvotes... but your GF was sort of TA.\n\nOf course you would go to her birthday party, was it really fair of her to leave you in a situation where you only knew her and her family? No, not really. Luckily you hit it off with her grandmother and had a great time. She got to party with her friends and the rest of her family. \n\nIf she wanted more of your attention, she could have used her words. I'm sure her grandmother wouldn't have minded her borrowing you for a dance or two.", "NTA. My birthday was yesterday too actually- not relevant though. \n\nI feel she\u2019s overreacting. Everyone was there for HER, so you being by her side the entire time shouldn\u2019t have been necessary. I\u2019d be damn happy my bf got close to my gma! Hopefully she\u2019ll calm down.", "NTA\n\nI think it's sweet that you connected so much with her grandmother and I'm surprised she is upset by it rather than enamoured.", "How lovely to have connected with her grandmother. You\u2019re NTA for that. It must feel wonderful to have someone from \u201chome.\u201d\n\nThere is a little bit AH energy in regard to tuning out your gf. You were there for the big moments, but I can understand if she felt a little hurt.\n\nBut she should move on! If I had a bf who so connected with my grandmother, I\u2019d be thrilled.", "Gonna go against the grain and say YTA if she had to pull you away to do pics or cake that should've been your hint to spend some time with her. It's nice you connected with her grandmother but she probably wanted her boyfriend to also be drinking, dancing, and talking to her and her friends at her 21st birthday. Going off to speak to a grandma in a language she can't understand for hours straight is not exactly normal party behavior. \n\nI think your intentions were good but you should apologize and try to be more mindful of how you split up your time especially at an event in your partners honor.", "NTA. It was your first time meeting her family, she should have expected you to spend a lot of time socializing with them rather than her as that\u2019s generally how you get to know people. Also, if she wanted to spend more time with you at the party she should politely have said something then.", "NTA", "NAH. \n\nParty likely sucked, and you spent it with the coolest lady in the room while your GF dealt with the rif raff. \n\nShould you have been more attentive, maybe.

Good for you for giving them the time as she drank herself to a toilet. \n\nMy grandma lived in my parents' house when I was still living there in 2010. My mom and I took care of her until the end. We knew her time was coming, so we asked for family (aunts, cousins,  and uncles to come to cleveland to see her because it was nearing the end). \n\nMy 22 year old cousin made some excuse as to why she could not visit knowing it was the end was near, and it was because she got too drunk to drive from Detroit.

As it was your girlfriend's family who threw her a party, you were your girlfriend's date. A part of dating is being attentive to your date. Yes, there may be other interesting people at the party, but you should still circulate.

He still takes the time to bridge that gap and find things to talk about.\n\nI get why OP\u2019s girlfriend is a bit upset, particularly if he spent the whole party speaking a different language and basically zoning everyone else out.

You got wrapped up in communicating with someone who you have a shared bond with and it must have been a wonderful feeling and breath of fresh air.

This is the first of her birthdays you are celebrating with her. (Also a major milestone) she wants you to be present and her telling you afterwards means she noticed your absence, which can be a good sign too.\n\nPersonally, however, this is a red flag for me. If she doesn\u2019t have some kind of specific issue with being ignored that you knew about, then this was a really special moment for both of you for different reasons.  Instead of loving and appreciating your connection to her family and to your home, she chose to focus on the negatives.

It's valid that she wanted to spend more time together at the party but she should of told you during not after.", "She likes you and is feeling a bit insecure.

You didn't want to disappoint her and disrespect your family by cutting your conversation with her short.\n\nAnd also did not want to monopolize her when there were so many family members and friends wanting to share your time.

Your girlfriend should be proud of the fact and especially empathetic towards you being in a whole country by yourself, and finally finding someone you can relate to.

You could apologize, though, and blame it on homesickness", "YTA. It was her 21st birthday, which is a big deal. She should have been the focus.

Or was she taking pictures with OP, then turning to talk to friends and no longer engaging OP? If the former, OP was a bit obtuse about it, while if the latter, she should have made an effort to let OP know she wanted them to join her. If my partner was drinking and dancing with friends and only really called me over a) when a camera was out or b) for moments that *all* the guests were a part of (eg, cake-cutting), I\u2019d assume they wanted space to catch up with friends and I\u2019d find a way to make that feel natural for them, even if I wasn\u2019t bonding with grandma.\n\nIdk, I\u2019ve always disliked when people expect their partners to be just waiting beside them like a toy on a shelf to be played with when desired then placed back on the shelf to wait.

If she wanted more time with OP, she could have easily come over and called him to have some fun with her friends or something. Her silently just waiting the entire day and hoping OP gets the hint is a lack of communication on her part.\n\nOf course, on the flip side, OP could have had a little more situational awareness there, but as many already pointed out he doesn't exactly suck for connecting well with his gf's family, which he really should be doing. I think armed with this knowledge, he can learn to balance his time a bit better.\n\nI don't think he deserves the anger of his gf, but this is a relationship, and relationships are not always about what's right and wrong. They are also about feelings. The most important part here is that the gf recognizes that OP did not willfully ignore her and is happy to give her attention when she needs it (So she will feel better), and that she also recognizes that she could also learn to take matters in her hands and ask for what she needs instead of waiting for it (So OP will feel better).\n\n--------\n\nTLDR: \n\nOP, tell your gf that you'll try to be more mindful of her, but there might be times where you lose track of time or get absorbed in something, so if she needs anything from you, she can always let you know and you'll be there for her.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, I was thinking the same.

Distant cousin is more likely than direct relative.", "Agreed.", "Agree with all this, although I'd go with a nice dinner somewhere rather than balloons or flowers - a dinner includes quality time spent together with OP's attention solely on his girlfriend.", "My dad threw a hissy fit that we (my teenaged daughters and I) weren\u2019t \u201crespecting his patriarchy.\u201d  So I said to my girls, \u201cYour grandfather thinks you should respect his patriarchy.\u201d My oldest just said, \u201cNo.\u201d  It was kind of perfect\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t know where his sudden streak of conservatism is coming; he\u2019s so not like that when it comes to other stuff. But my dad is obsessed with being patriarch of the family. So yes, it is still a thing. Bizarrely, even among pot-smoking American liberals.", "YES.  Believe me, getting grandma on your side when you're trying to build a relationship with her granddaughter can mean everything.  No matter what, when you're dating a woman, the women in her family carry a lot of weight.   Not as much as they used to, but a lot still.", "Yeah, in any family where the kids like/respect their parents.  Even as an adult yourself with kids of your own your parents opinions can hold a lot of weight. \n\nMy grandparents had a lot of sway over my cousins generation.  They were the lynchpins that kept dozens of family members connected.  Calls, visits, letters, family get togethers, reunions that brought kids and grandkids back from half a country away to reconnect with each other - my grandparents were the ones who put in the work to keep fifty-ish blood and adopted and married-in family members connected to each other.  Getting the grandparents seal of approval of an SO wasn\u2019t necessary or anything, but it did basically mean instant acceptance into the family.", "Yeah that's the bottom line for me.  Both parties' feelings are understandable.  That's why I have to go NAH here.", "People are far too forgiving of women being irrational here. Flip the genders and it'd definitely be NTA and he'd be entitled and controlling or something.", "What if grandma was hot tho and the gf thought she was gonna get her man stolen by that cougar", "What he was is \"my girlfriends 21st\"\n\nMy (23) and my gf (21) celebrated her bday.\nMy gf and I celebrated her bday.\n\nI hope I'm explaining that it's clearer!", "Oh sorry dinner/date was meant to be implied!I just meant when on the date, have a 21st badge balloon to make it more \u201cbirthday like\u201d. I\u2019m big on birthdays too & the badges/cards/balloons make it more special *whilst* you do the event.", "Brits: we got this \nSorrys all around.", "I used to feel the same way (as an autistic person I can feel very impatient if I'm not particularly interested in the topic of conversation) but I have to tell you, now that my parents are in their 80s, I crave hearing their voices and their stories as much as I can, before they're gone, because it feels like time is slipping away. And I desperately miss hearing my grandmother.  I heard her voice on a video the other day and cried.\n\nI know it sounds corny, but remember that some of these older voices that feel tedious now are going to slip through your fingers like sand in a few years, and you won't get them back. So if you can, take the time to REALLY listen . . .", "Is this a culture shift because I just don't remember birthdays ever being such a huge deal. Like my younger coworkers have birthday weeks, take their birthdays off work, it's a huge event. In my Teens and  twenties and early thirties I just don't remember people caring?\n\nLike once a year people now get to play princess for a day?", "I think that given that the BF was new to the family, it was on them to go up and try to get to know him. He isn\u2019t responsible to go around looking for them and introduce himself. There\u2019s one of him and many of them. They can walk across the yard and say hi.", "best said \ud83d\ude2d", "I absolutely spend as much time possible with them. Or calling them. I\u2019m pretty sure I talk to them more than my own parents", "I was told that an OP should break up w their partner, because their partner had hurt feelings & the OP \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to apologise\u201d in this reddit just yesterday. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude05\nI\u2019m so relieved to have these mature, understanding responses, it definitely renews my faith in humanity \ud83d\ude02", "I love that response! Empathy even if an apology isn\u2019t necessary is so helpful and important.", "Yes. Next question?", "It was nice to talk to her grandmother but not at her birthday party. She might even breakup with you over that. So yes, YTA", "I'm sure she already knows, and he already apologized.", ">I would think she'd be excited you connected so well with her grandmother.  Family approval makes relationships a lot easier\n\nThis!  GF should have been super happy that her GM had an good time.", "Nta this comment", "Yeah. No. That\u2019s ridiculous.  Her 21st birthday party was not the time to sit and talk with only 2 people. She reasonably wanted to enjoy her party and all the guests and have a good time- no 21yo wants to sit and listen to 2 people talk about things you don\u2019t know anything about- even if she would be learning new things about her grandma *and* bf. There is a place and time for that and her birthday *party* wasn\u2019t it. I would have agreed with you if the even was a family dinner or get together. But to do what you suggest would mean she was also ignoring everyone else who came to see and celebrate with her. And how is that enjoyable for her guests?", "I'm going to ignore the Reddit victim complex half of your reply because its just not worth the time.\n\nBut otherwise, how did she shame him exactly?  You're completely overstating her reaction to him.  She's upset.  That's a far cry from shaming someone.  She shared her feelings.  Is she not allowed to do that?\n\nFrankly, it seems like a perfectly healthy conflict between them.  This is how adult couples grow together.", "Yes, reward the temper tantrum so she continues to weaponize her emotions instead of communicating effectively.", "Where are you getting that it was also his birthday from?", "Not really that big of a deal if grandma hates you.\n\nBut if grandma LOVES you? C'mon", "WTF did I just read?", "A joke that didn\u2019t land lol", "If they\u2019re in the US, it\u2019s the legal drinking age. There\u2019s other things that are legal at 21 depending on the state, but alcohol is a big one.", "Maybe so but she\u2019s the granddaughter and the girlfriend (and the guest of honor) so I wouldn\u2019t think it would be awkward for her interject in English", "It *wasn\u2019t* his birthday.", "nvm Im stupid I just found out what it means", "Where was that implied?", "The Brits are VERY good at apologizing\u2026so polite as well\u2026", "Yeah that\u2019s another thing, he IS talking, just to one person."]}
