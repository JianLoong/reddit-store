It's hard to fault her based on your description of events.", "NAH but apologize. Tell her you got on so well with her grandmother you didn't realize you were ignoring her and say you're sorry for not giving her enough attention on her birthday. I'm not saying you were wrong, but you inadvertently hurt your gf so just say you're sorry and move on.  You could argue that you did nothing wrong but then you're arguing and this is such a small misunderstanding of expectations (in a fairly new relationship), don't make it into a big drama.", "You connected with the matriarch of the family\n\nThat will pay dividends down the road\n\nBut it also sounds like you maybe ignored everyone at the party...including your girlfriend, because you got caught up with the grandmother.\n\nSo for now, just acknowledge that yes...you should have paid more attention to your girlfriend and the other party guests...and that you just got excited being able to speak your native language and talk to someone who grew up where you grew up\n\nMaybe then take her out for a second birthday....Nothing fancy.  Maybe just desert and a stroll around a park at sunset.  Something where you can just focus 100% of your attention on her and how you feel about her.\n\nThere are times to be defiant and tell your partner they are being immature or insecure....and there are times where you just accept that \"yeah, I probably could have done a better job\"\n\nI think this is one of those times where just acknowledging her feelings on the matter and letting her know you hear her and will do better in the future.  And then you do better.\n\nFor most people, that is all they want out of situations like this.  An acknowledgement that their feelings are valid and a respectful resolution to the issue.  Sadly, most people just can't seem to do that.  Which is why so many relationships turn toxic.\n\nNAH", "INFO: did you just sit with the grandma for hours and not really connect with other friends family members?", "I really thought I was about to read that he found out they were 2nd cousins or something", "NAH\n\nThis is just a situation you need to learn from. I don't think you are necessarily an AH here. It is important to pay attention to the birthday person at any celebration but especially if you are their SO.\n\nAnother thing, it can be very difficult to stop 2 people in deep conversation so they may have been distressed but not confident enough to mention at the time to you.\n\nSay you're sorry and next event you will aim to spend more time focused on them.\n\nI had a similar situation when dating someone, we went to a party and I saw a friend there who I hadn't seen in like a decade, we used to play sports and hang out a lot in secondary school. We spent a while catching up with each other and before we knew it turns out we had been speaking just ourselves over an hour. This was despite me ignoring the hints from my partner that we should go and get another drink. :) I apologised and we moved on.", "NAH.  \n\nYou were understandably excited to talk to grandma.  Girlfriend knew your history and it should have occurred to her that you and grandma would want to talk.  However, your girlfriend was also understandably excited for a milestone birthday, and you knew it.   She's probably wondering if she's going to be ignored by you at every big event.\n\nNeither of you behaved ideally, but I don't believe there was actual malice or intent on either side.  You're *both* pretty young and maybe a little self-centered (different from selfish), which is why I didn't go with N T A or E S H.  Use this as a learning experiencce, and communicate better with your girlfriend.", "I would personally be charmed if my partner got on so well with my grandmother and spoke to her all night in her first language. I\u2019m old though so maybe I expect different things from a partner than a freshly minted adult does. A partner who engages with my family and makes them feel important and special is lovely. And honestly, I would also be so delighted to see my partner happy talking about their home and getting the chance to speak to someone who understands them in their language of origin. \n\nPerhaps try to express how meaningful it was to you and see if she gets it. NTA", "NAH. When I lived in France as a teenager and didn\u2019t speak my native language for the better part of a year, I couldn\u2019t believe how excited I got when I met someone from the UK and I could suddenly fully express myself with language again. I\u2019m not even from the UK so it\u2019s not like we had a shared cultural background, just the literal fact of speaking my native language for a bit felt amazing. So I totally understand why you got carried away and spent the whole party with grandma.\n\nBut you should definitely apologize, because it is kind of crappy to invite someone to your birthday party and have them ignore you\u2014even unintentionally. Just explain that you got carried away, maybe plan a special afternoon or dinner or whatever for just the two of you, and be more mindful in the future if you go to any more family events. You didn\u2019t do your gf any actual harm, so don\u2019t grovel or let yourself feel guilty after you apologize.", "NAH\n\nSeems like more of a problem with expectations. You were understandably prioritizing learning more  about your heritage. The problem is your girlfriend probably wanted to introduce you to friends/family.  A lot of marriage is simply understanding and apologizing for accidental hurt feelings. This seems like one of those.", "NTA\n\nHanging out with her grandmother at her birthday party is actually kind of sweet. It seems like a perfectly natural and organic social interaction.", "NTA. Just talk to her about it and explain what you explained in the post. It\u2019s understandable that she feels hurt. As you didn\u2019t do it on purpose though, just talking it out is probably the best course of action", "NTA.  Personally I would be delighted if my partner was able to make that type of connection with a family member.  Your gf should have approached you at the party if she needed more attention from you. I suppose you could have made an attempt to approach her as well just to check in.   But really- it\u2019s kit like you met grandma and just latched on, making small talk to pass the time.  You were deeply engaged in a meaningful discussion which I imagine was emotional ( happy/exciting/nostalgic/etc).  \n\nGive her a big hug today.  Tell her you\u2019re sorry time escaped you and then explain how wonderful it was meeting and talking with her grandma.  And that you\u2019re looking forward to more social gatherings so you can get to know her other family and friends as well.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s lovely you had such a nice time talking to her grandmother. If I were your girlfriend, I\u2019d be happy you enjoyed getting to know her.", "NTA - she should have been happy you connected with someone important in her family.", "NTA, very understandable scenario, and you were connecting with her grandmother and reconnecting with your roots. I think it's lovely, and I think she will come around.", "NTA - Although I can see how she might feel neglected or not made to feel special. I think ignoring is a strong word to use here. You were connecting with her grandmother. If it were me, I'd be ecstatic that my significant other sat and chatted with my grandparents instead of sitting on their phone or getting drunk and sloppy at a party. \n\nApologize because I can see how she may have hurt feelings but you're not the asshole in the situation.", "NTA. She had lots of attention.", "NTA. She should haver expressed it during the party not after if she wanted you to spend more time with her. You're not a mind reader.\n\nEdit: Also, you weren't ignoring her, you were just chatting with her grandma who would have definetely been ignored otherwise. I'm sure you made her day special! I hope your gf gonna realise this soon.", "It's all good. Grandma loves him now, so he's in like flint. The GF will get over it.", "NTA - I will prep myself for the downvotes... but your GF was sort of TA.\n\nOf course you would go to her birthday party, was it really fair of her to leave you in a situation where you only knew her and her family? No, not really. Luckily you hit it off with her grandmother and had a great time. She got to party with her friends and the rest of her family. \n\nIf she wanted more of your attention, she could have used her words. I'm sure her grandmother wouldn't have minded her borrowing you for a dance or two.", "NTA. My birthday was yesterday too actually- not relevant though. \n\nI feel she\u2019s overreacting. Everyone was there for HER, so you being by her side the entire time shouldn\u2019t have been necessary. I\u2019d be damn happy my bf got close to my gma! Hopefully she\u2019ll calm down.", "NTA\n\nI think it's sweet that you connected so much with her grandmother and I'm surprised she is upset by it rather than enamoured.", "How lovely to have connected with her grandmother. You\u2019re NTA for that. It must feel wonderful to have someone from \u201chome.\u201d\n\nThere is a little bit AH energy in regard to tuning out your gf. You were there for the big moments, but I can understand if she felt a little hurt.\n\nBut she should move on! If I had a bf who so connected with my grandmother, I\u2019d be thrilled.", "Gonna go against the grain and say YTA if she had to pull you away to do pics or cake that should've been your hint to spend some time with her. It's nice you connected with her grandmother but she probably wanted her boyfriend to also be drinking, dancing, and talking to her and her friends at her 21st birthday. Going off to speak to a grandma in a language she can't understand for hours straight is not exactly normal party behavior. \n\nI think your intentions were good but you should apologize and try to be more mindful of how you split up your time especially at an event in your partners honor.", "NTA. It was your first time meeting her family, she should have expected you to spend a lot of time socializing with them rather than her as that\u2019s generally how you get to know people. Also, if she wanted to spend more time with you at the party she should politely have said something then.", "NTA", "NAH. \n\nParty likely sucked, and you spent it with the coolest lady in the room while your GF dealt with the rif raff. \n\nShould you have been more attentive, maybe.

Good for you for giving them the time as she drank herself to a toilet. \n\nMy grandma lived in my parents' house when I was still living there in 2010. My mom and I took care of her until the end. We knew her time was coming, so we asked for family (aunts, cousins,  and uncles to come to cleveland to see her because it was nearing the end). \n\nMy 22 year old cousin made some excuse as to why she could not visit knowing it was the end was near, and it was because she got too drunk to drive from Detroit.

As it was your girlfriend's family who threw her a party, you were your girlfriend's date. A part of dating is being attentive to your date. Yes, there may be other interesting people at the party, but you should still circulate.

He still takes the time to bridge that gap and find things to talk about.\n\nI get why OP\u2019s girlfriend is a bit upset, particularly if he spent the whole party speaking a different language and basically zoning everyone else out.

You got wrapped up in communicating with someone who you have a shared bond with and it must have been a wonderful feeling and breath of fresh air.

This is the first of her birthdays you are celebrating with her. (Also a major milestone) she wants you to be present and her telling you afterwards means she noticed your absence, which can be a good sign too.\n\nPersonally, however, this is a red flag for me. If she doesn\u2019t have some kind of specific issue with being ignored that you knew about, then this was a really special moment for both of you for different reasons.  Instead of loving and appreciating your connection to her family and to your home, she chose to focus on the negatives.

It's valid that she wanted to spend more time together at the party but she should of told you during not after.", "She likes you and is feeling a bit insecure.

You didn't want to disappoint her and disrespect your family by cutting your conversation with her short.\n\nAnd also did not want to monopolize her when there were so many family members and friends wanting to share your time.

Really?\n\nYou are most definitely the asshole, this is probably the biggest birthday ever for someone and you made her feel less important than her gran. The only thing that would make it worse is if it was a young girl you ignored her for", "NTA\n\nThe first time I met my boyfriend\u2019s family was the last time I was able to meet his grandfather. I spent the entire dinner party in the corner with his grandfather, connecting with him because I enjoyed talking to him. To this day, my partner tells me it was one of the things that made him fall in love with me - seeing us talking and connecting when most people wouldn\u2019t speak to him because he was very old. Your girlfriend should be proud of the fact and especially empathetic towards you being in a whole country by yourself, and finally finding someone you can relate to. She\u2019s either demonstrating that she is not a family oriented person, or has no empathy towards you as an immigrant - either way they are both red flags imo", "I gotta end up saying NTA.  Under most circumstances I would say otherwise but it\u2019s a total fluke that halfway (not quite but nearly) around the globe you end up in a relationship with a girl whose grandmother grew up where you did.  Too cool of an opportunity to pass up.   Maybe in the future try to pay more attention to her, but 11 years away from where you grew up to meet someone from \u201chome\u201d is a highly chance meeting", "NTA - any boyfriend who came and spent so much quality time with my nana would basically become marriage material. \n\nAs it was her birthday she would have been required to host and spend time with everyone and it would have been rude for you to spend the whole night together", "NTA. She should\u2019ve  involved you more.", "NTA. I\u2019d think she would have been happy with you hitting it off with her family but you might want to apologize for maybe not noticing how she was feeling about the length of time you were spending with others on her birthday.", "NTA. I wonder un she considered how wonderful ID was for her grandmother to reminisce with someone from her home country. I bet she enjoyed it immensely.", "nta. gf sounds needy and entitled..", "NTA but definitely apologize and maybe take her out to do something fun!", "NTA though still apologize but tell her how it made you feel at home. I\u2019m sure her grandmother was delighted at the conversation in your native language", "NTA. You could never have predicted that your gf's grandmother was from the same area of Romania as you. You were caught up in the conversation, and at least you were with your gf for cutting the cake, pictures, etc. Next time, you and the grandmother may have less to talk about and you can pay more attention to your gf.", "I understand your enthusiasm for finding another soul to talk to into your native language, from the same country part. She should be happy you connected to her family, and too bad your first encounter was during her party. I would've understood her if your attention was drawn by a friend of hers or your phone. You could apologize, though, and blame it on homesickness", "YTA. It was her 21st birthday, which is a big deal. She should have been the focus. It's awesome you had a lot to talk about with the gramma, but you should have asked to make time to go get tea with the gramma at a later time to reminisce and then spent the rest of the party meeting her friends and spending time with her. That was an important binding experience you missed out on in your relationship.", "Family approval makes relationships a lot easier so i think shes just jealous of u not giving attention aka a HUGEE red flag i'm not saying u should break  up  but relationships like this are bad.\n\nshes the asshole not u\n\nbut like i dont really blame anyone here but yh maybe communicate with her , tell her that ur sorry ect... if that doesen't work then its a red flag and maybe get out of this trama", "YTA\n\nSeriously?", "why are men so oblivious YTA", "NTA Parties are for socialising, I\u2019m sure she was probably circulating. What does she want? A cling on?", "OP- NTA.\n\nLike everyone else, apologize for not giving both balanced attention. I know sometimes it's difficult to tear away from an elder, and you want to be polite as well. It's even harder when you are having a wonderful time sharing stories. \n\nLet your GF know it was not at all on purpose, and that time slipped away, and that you really like her grandmother, and it was like a taste of home. \n\nI'm also sure there may be some cultural differences as well in terms of manners with elders too. But it was an innocent mistake. Give her some time to process and then see if you can find time to talk.", "NTA. Part of a relationship is also getting to know the family well. OP bonded with his gfs grandmother, the gf should be happy they got along. Instead she seems pissed off", "This is exactly what needs to be said!", "Exactly!! And don\u2019t be afraid to rant and rave about how much you enjoyed connecting with gramma, how it\u2019s so important for grammas to connect with younger people.", "Exactly this OP. You\u2019re only 7 months into the relationship. Miscommunications happen like this. No big deal and definitely not worth arguing over.", "Exactly this. She can be happy that you connected whilst still feeling neglected. Acknowledging her feelings and apologizing doesn\u2019t automatically mean you were intentionally hurtful or did anything explicitly wrong. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong also doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s being immature or that she\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just people recognizing their own and their partner\u2019s needs and feelings.\nNAH", "At the same time, the girlfriend could have joined the conversation with OP and their own grandmother. \n\nI agree NAH.", "The only thing I\u2019d add is I wonder what activities she invited OP to join in; was she asking them to come take pictures then immediately moving towards the dance floor only to see OP had already vanished? Or was she taking pictures with OP, then turning to talk to friends and no longer engaging OP? If the former, OP was a bit obtuse about it, while if the latter, she should have made an effort to let OP know she wanted them to join her. If my partner was drinking and dancing with friends and only really called me over a) when a camera was out or b) for moments that *all* the guests were a part of (eg, cake-cutting), I\u2019d assume they wanted space to catch up with friends and I\u2019d find a way to make that feel natural for them, even if I wasn\u2019t bonding with grandma.\n\nIdk, I\u2019ve always disliked when people expect their partners to be just waiting beside them like a toy on a shelf to be played with when desired then placed back on the shelf to wait. More INFO could show that OP or gf messed up here, even though I think n a h is the most likely conclusion.", "Very thoughtful response. I agree! NAH", "Maybe do a genealogy test just to make sure.", "Now THIS is a man who knows how to marry his cousin!", "Being from that region it's highly possible they're related   on some level", "tbf when you meet someone who\u2019s from the exact same country as you and probably the first person you met in a dominantly english speaking that speaks the same language as you it\u2019d be pretty understandable to focus on talking to them a lot during the gathering or event or what have you but i will admit OP should have focused on his girlfriend abit more but it\u2019s understandable", "Lmaooo", "Likewise. And also, I don't know how in tune OP's girlfriend is with her Romanian heritage, but this could be an opportunity for her to connect with that side of her ancestry through OP and the grandmother.", "This isn\u2019t about you", "All this. Definitely NTA. \n\nCan't understand the N A H voting. Gf sounds a bit self absorbed and needs to check herself", "I hate the \"I'm sorry I made you feel that way\" it's only a short step from the \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" non-apology. \nApologies should ID the apologizers exact actions that led to the harm, ideally with some promise of trying harder not to repeat that action in the future.", "Huh, I always thought it was spelled 'grok' but a quick google search shows me that both spellings are common.", "\u201cExpects so much of his attention\u201d on her literal milestone birthday at her literal birthday party? It\u2019s not wrong to expect attention sometimes good lord", "She may have been looking forward to introducing him to the special people in her life that night. It was his first time meeting most of her family by the sounds of the post. It's hard to do that if he isn't talking to anyone else but grandma.", "I like this approach", "And if she hadn't asked to set up those photos there wouldn't have been a nice pic of the 2 of them together at her bday celebration", "Its not like his girlfriend was sitting in the corner with nothing to do and nobody to talk to. She was surrounded by her friends and family, who were all celebrating her.", "NAH- you didn't neglect her you were at the party socializing with her party guests. It's valid that she wanted to spend more time together at the party but she should of told you during not after.", "Lol people act like this and wonder why they suck in relationships", "He needs to apologize, but no ill intent involved. And they need to make sure they are not cousins. Or something.....", "Yeah, apologize sincerely rather than being defensive, tell her you understand why she feels that way, and do something nice for her.  I\u2019m sure you will both feel better.  \nSource: am a guy", "I don't see anyone else saying this in this reply thread, so I'd to mention that the gf could also have done a better job communicating during the party. If she wanted more time with OP, she could have easily come over and called him to have some fun with her friends or something. Her silently just waiting the entire day and hoping OP gets the hint is a lack of communication on her part.\n\nOf course, on the flip side, OP could have had a little more situational awareness there, but as many already pointed out he doesn't exactly suck for connecting well with his gf's family, which he really should be doing. I think armed with this knowledge, he can learn to balance his time a bit better.\n\nI don't think he deserves the anger of his gf, but this is a relationship, and relationships are not always about what's right and wrong. They are also about feelings. The most important part here is that the gf recognizes that OP did not willfully ignore her and is happy to give her attention when she needs it (So she will feel better), and that she also recognizes that she could also learn to take matters in her hands and ask for what she needs instead of waiting for it (So OP will feel better).\n\n\\-------\n\nTLDR: OP, tell your gf that you'll try to be more mindful of her, but there might be times where you lose track of time or get absorbed in something, so if she needs anything from you, she can always let you know and you'll be there for her.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, I was thinking the same. Speaking in language unknown to others accidentally exclude others from the conversation. I totally understand why they spoke in Romanian, it had to be nice for both of them to finally meet someone who understands their mother tongue. But by that they excluded the girlfriend to join them and for most part even to politely interrupt them because she had no idea when the lull in the conversation can be to offer the switch of topic.", "If she spoke the language.

And on the quite rare occasion she doesn't like someone, that person tends to be truly awful, like my sibling's cheating, douchey ex-spouse.\n\nMy family's not particularly traditional or anything, but generally the matriarch/patriarch's blessings have carried a lot of weight.", "Oh it absolutely is.", "Idk because my family doesn't give a shit about that stuff so I always find it weird \ud83d\ude06", "Its always felt like such an outlandish concept, but a family we are good friends still have this concept of the matriarch.

Her family through the party and it seems whole family was their and he said she talked about her grandmother to him. The problem I think from her point of view was having to ask him to take pictures and be by her side when cutting cake. OP is NTA but he did ignore her the whole party unless asked. He owes her an apology and acknowledges he could do better in future events to balance time. It\u2019s great connecting with someone you can share language and culture with but it\u2019s not like he would never see her again, so to spend a little time celebrating a special birthday with gf was at least he could have done.", "It's similar phrasing, but the intent really isn't.\n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way\" means you're not the one that's the problem, it's the other party's hurt feelings.

It's taking ownership of the problem (\"**I** made you\") and apologizing for being the cause of those hurt feelings.\n\nSure, OP could be more specific, but that phrasing isn't actually a \"short step\" from a non-apology.", "I just noticed that my spellcheck doesn't flag grok the way it does grokk.  So while both are common, I may have been using the wrong one.", "OP said \"Of course when my gf asked me to take photos with her, or when the cake came I gave her my full attention\"\nBasically gf had to request time or attention actively to get OP to participate in things with her. \nI wouldn't enjoy doing that more than a couple times at my party and I'd probably stop trying and resign to the person not spending time with me if they kept obliging briefly and going back to what they were doing before.", "She should be happy he is not attached to her hip.", "I agree I don\u2019t think either is the Asshole but we don\u2019t have enough information.\n\nIt could well be that the Gran is a bit of a talker and OP felt rude to leave, it may be that (as is often the case with elderly guests), she is often sat on her own and ceased the opportunity to talk to someone.\n\nIf OP\u2019s GF wanted to introduce him to everyone in the family then she should\u2019ve done so - if she felt there was too much interaction between the Gran and OP, she could\u2019ve gone in and \u2018rescued him\u2019 before introducing him to Uncle Joe and Aunty Jean.\n\nMy wife jokes that I am someone who people will just talk at, to the point that I can get stuck talking to the same person at social events for hours, because they may be lonely and I\u2019m too rude to go \u201cthanks for the chat, I promised Mick I\u2019d catch up with him\u201d.
