It's hard to fault her based on your description of events.", "NAH but apologize. Tell her you got on so well with her grandmother you didn't realize you were ignoring her and say you're sorry for not giving her enough attention on her birthday. I'm not saying you were wrong, but you inadvertently hurt your gf so just say you're sorry and move on.  You could argue that you did nothing wrong but then you're arguing and this is such a small misunderstanding of expectations (in a fairly new relationship), don't make it into a big drama.", "You connected with the matriarch of the family\n\nThat will pay dividends down the road\n\nBut it also sounds like you maybe ignored everyone at the party...including your girlfriend, because you got caught up with the grandmother.\n\nSo for now, just acknowledge that yes...you should have paid more attention to your girlfriend and the other party guests...and that you just got excited being able to speak your native language and talk to someone who grew up where you grew up\n\nMaybe then take her out for a second birthday....Nothing fancy.  Maybe just desert and a stroll around a park at sunset.  Something where you can just focus 100% of your attention on her and how you feel about her.\n\nThere are times to be defiant and tell your partner they are being immature or insecure....and there are times where you just accept that \"yeah, I probably could have done a better job\"\n\nI think this is one of those times where just acknowledging her feelings on the matter and letting her know you hear her and will do better in the future.  And then you do better.\n\nFor most people, that is all they want out of situations like this.  An acknowledgement that their feelings are valid and a respectful resolution to the issue.  Sadly, most people just can't seem to do that.  Which is why so many relationships turn toxic.\n\nNAH", "INFO: did you just sit with the grandma for hours and not really connect with other friends family members?", "I really thought I was about to read that he found out they were 2nd cousins or something", "NAH\n\nThis is just a situation you need to learn from. I don't think you are necessarily an AH here. It is important to pay attention to the birthday person at any celebration but especially if you are their SO.\n\nAnother thing, it can be very difficult to stop 2 people in deep conversation so they may have been distressed but not confident enough to mention at the time to you.\n\nSay you're sorry and next event you will aim to spend more time focused on them.\n\nI had a similar situation when dating someone, we went to a party and I saw a friend there who I hadn't seen in like a decade, we used to play sports and hang out a lot in secondary school. We spent a while catching up with each other and before we knew it turns out we had been speaking just ourselves over an hour. This was despite me ignoring the hints from my partner that we should go and get another drink. :) I apologised and we moved on.", "NAH.  \n\nYou were understandably excited to talk to grandma.  Girlfriend knew your history and it should have occurred to her that you and grandma would want to talk.  However, your girlfriend was also understandably excited for a milestone birthday, and you knew it.   She's probably wondering if she's going to be ignored by you at every big event.\n\nNeither of you behaved ideally, but I don't believe there was actual malice or intent on either side.  You're *both* pretty young and maybe a little self-centered (different from selfish), which is why I didn't go with N T A or E S H.  Use this as a learning experiencce, and communicate better with your girlfriend.", "I would personally be charmed if my partner got on so well with my grandmother and spoke to her all night in her first language. I\u2019m old though so maybe I expect different things from a partner than a freshly minted adult does. A partner who engages with my family and makes them feel important and special is lovely. And honestly, I would also be so delighted to see my partner happy talking about their home and getting the chance to speak to someone who understands them in their language of origin. \n\nPerhaps try to express how meaningful it was to you and see if she gets it. NTA", "NAH. When I lived in France as a teenager and didn\u2019t speak my native language for the better part of a year, I couldn\u2019t believe how excited I got when I met someone from the UK and I could suddenly fully express myself with language again. I\u2019m not even from the UK so it\u2019s not like we had a shared cultural background, just the literal fact of speaking my native language for a bit felt amazing. So I totally understand why you got carried away and spent the whole party with grandma.\n\nBut you should definitely apologize, because it is kind of crappy to invite someone to your birthday party and have them ignore you\u2014even unintentionally. Just explain that you got carried away, maybe plan a special afternoon or dinner or whatever for just the two of you, and be more mindful in the future if you go to any more family events. You didn\u2019t do your gf any actual harm, so don\u2019t grovel or let yourself feel guilty after you apologize.", "NAH\n\nSeems like more of a problem with expectations. You were understandably prioritizing learning more  about your heritage. The problem is your girlfriend probably wanted to introduce you to friends/family.  A lot of marriage is simply understanding and apologizing for accidental hurt feelings. This seems like one of those.", "NTA\n\nHanging out with her grandmother at her birthday party is actually kind of sweet. It seems like a perfectly natural and organic social interaction.", "NTA. Just talk to her about it and explain what you explained in the post. It\u2019s understandable that she feels hurt. As you didn\u2019t do it on purpose though, just talking it out is probably the best course of action", "NTA.  Personally I would be delighted if my partner was able to make that type of connection with a family member.  Your gf should have approached you at the party if she needed more attention from you. I suppose you could have made an attempt to approach her as well just to check in.   But really- it\u2019s kit like you met grandma and just latched on, making small talk to pass the time.  You were deeply engaged in a meaningful discussion which I imagine was emotional ( happy/exciting/nostalgic/etc).  \n\nGive her a big hug today.  Tell her you\u2019re sorry time escaped you and then explain how wonderful it was meeting and talking with her grandma.  And that you\u2019re looking forward to more social gatherings so you can get to know her other family and friends as well.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s lovely you had such a nice time talking to her grandmother. If I were your girlfriend, I\u2019d be happy you enjoyed getting to know her.", "NTA - she should have been happy you connected with someone important in her family.", "NTA, very understandable scenario, and you were connecting with her grandmother and reconnecting with your roots. I think it's lovely, and I think she will come around.", "NTA - Although I can see how she might feel neglected or not made to feel special. I think ignoring is a strong word to use here. You were connecting with her grandmother. If it were me, I'd be ecstatic that my significant other sat and chatted with my grandparents instead of sitting on their phone or getting drunk and sloppy at a party. \n\nApologize because I can see how she may have hurt feelings but you're not the asshole in the situation.", "NTA. She had lots of attention.", "NTA. She should haver expressed it during the party not after if she wanted you to spend more time with her. You're not a mind reader.\n\nEdit: Also, you weren't ignoring her, you were just chatting with her grandma who would have definetely been ignored otherwise. I'm sure you made her day special! I hope your gf gonna realise this soon.", "It's all good. Grandma loves him now, so he's in like flint. The GF will get over it.", "NTA - I will prep myself for the downvotes... but your GF was sort of TA.\n\nOf course you would go to her birthday party, was it really fair of her to leave you in a situation where you only knew her and her family? No, not really. Luckily you hit it off with her grandmother and had a great time. She got to party with her friends and the rest of her family. \n\nIf she wanted more of your attention, she could have used her words. I'm sure her grandmother wouldn't have minded her borrowing you for a dance or two.", "NTA. My birthday was yesterday too actually- not relevant though. \n\nI feel she\u2019s overreacting. Everyone was there for HER, so you being by her side the entire time shouldn\u2019t have been necessary. I\u2019d be damn happy my bf got close to my gma! Hopefully she\u2019ll calm down.", "NTA\n\nI think it's sweet that you connected so much with her grandmother and I'm surprised she is upset by it rather than enamoured.", "How lovely to have connected with her grandmother. You\u2019re NTA for that. It must feel wonderful to have someone from \u201chome.\u201d\n\nThere is a little bit AH energy in regard to tuning out your gf. You were there for the big moments, but I can understand if she felt a little hurt.\n\nBut she should move on! If I had a bf who so connected with my grandmother, I\u2019d be thrilled.", "Gonna go against the grain and say YTA if she had to pull you away to do pics or cake that should've been your hint to spend some time with her. It's nice you connected with her grandmother but she probably wanted her boyfriend to also be drinking, dancing, and talking to her and her friends at her 21st birthday. Going off to speak to a grandma in a language she can't understand for hours straight is not exactly normal party behavior. \n\nI think your intentions were good but you should apologize and try to be more mindful of how you split up your time especially at an event in your partners honor.", "NTA. It was your first time meeting her family, she should have expected you to spend a lot of time socializing with them rather than her as that\u2019s generally how you get to know people. Also, if she wanted to spend more time with you at the party she should politely have said something then.", "NTA", "NAH. \n\nParty likely sucked, and you spent it with the coolest lady in the room while your GF dealt with the rif raff. \n\nShould you have been more attentive, maybe.

Good for you for giving them the time as she drank herself to a toilet. \n\nMy grandma lived in my parents' house when I was still living there in 2010. My mom and I took care of her until the end. We knew her time was coming, so we asked for family (aunts, cousins,  and uncles to come to cleveland to see her because it was nearing the end). \n\nMy 22 year old cousin made some excuse as to why she could not visit knowing it was the end was near, and it was because she got too drunk to drive from Detroit.

As it was your girlfriend's family who threw her a party, you were your girlfriend's date. A part of dating is being attentive to your date. Yes, there may be other interesting people at the party, but you should still circulate.

He still takes the time to bridge that gap and find things to talk about.\n\nI get why OP\u2019s girlfriend is a bit upset, particularly if he spent the whole party speaking a different language and basically zoning everyone else out. But for me I would also appreciate the effort expended towards a family member who maybe isn\u2019t on the same zone as most of my friends. I think it\u2019s NAH.", "I'm not saying it's not important to connect with your partners family, It's just the concept of the matriarch/patriarch stuff still being used that had me surprised.", "There was another that popped up in my feed this morning, close on ages and time dating... but she was mad at the bf for only buying her a pair of socks with holes (aka polka dots)", "[Here you go](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mm5sz/aita_for_misusing_one_of_my_birthday_gifts/)", "Yeah you need to read other AITA posts, find the incident full of holes and connect the dots", "Uh yes because it was for self centered reasons - homesickness. OP didn't give a fuck ab his gf, he did it for himself. Everyone else is gaslighting the gf for being upset and saying that she will just have to deal - um, what a fucking terrible way to be a SO though. His gf isn't thrilled bc he didn't care about her at her OWN party, and only did things with her when she asked and then returned back to grandma.\n\n\nIt's giving this: \nhttps://youtu.be/ploHR84-9UA\n\n\nExcept zipline was a grandma", "Agreed! I see a lot of people on these threads who insist that just because they\u2019re *technically* right, that they don\u2019t *need* to apologise. It\u2019s WILD to me that some people care so much more about being *right*, than apologising for hurting someone!", "This is a great way of putting it, thanks.", "OP\u2019s gf: \u201cI lost a boyfriend but gained a grandfather \u2026. \u201c", "Holy cow. That make sense.", "If OP's only goal is to prove he's right, he should follow your advice. If OP would like to have a healthy and peaceful relationship, your advice sucks. Apologizing for upsetting your partner is not being a doormat, it comes from trying to better understand each other and your needs. I'm sorry you date people who take advantage of you and need to draw lines in the sand, but not everyone is like that.", "You have a bad perspective on what it means to be sorry. It's about intention vs consequence. You can be sorry for how you made someone feel without being sorry for what you did. But you should still say sorry for causing hurt", "well you sound like a catch...", "Lol you are overcorrecting now due to being a people pleaser in the past.  You can certainly apologize for accidentally hurting someone's feelings.  He isn't saying he did anything wrong, he would just be acknowledging that he hurt her feelings and that he was sorry for that.", "Seems like you're projecting...", "Have you considered that you went from being a doormat to being an arsehole without pausing inbetween? Apologising for unintentionally hurting someone\u2019s feelings doesn\u2019t fall at either extreme.", "That's only your own personal experience, which isn't the law. If you're that untrustworthy and constantly on guard, don't be in relationships. He's not going to lose anything by apologizing and being empathetic.\n\nIt's not that he did anything wrong, it's that he unintentionally hurt her which still warrants an apology.", "I suggest talking to a professional in the nicest way possible. Learn to communicate before you get into another relationship to make your own life easier. Trying to prove you are right all the time is a recipie for a disaster", "I'm sorry someone hurt you in the past. You seem to still have a chip on your shoulder about it. Apologizing for hurting someone's feelings isn't apologizing for \"every little thing\". In a healthy relationship there's nothing wrong with apologizing if you've hurt the other person intentionally or not.", "Same, it's not something I'm used to here at all. I see it on Reddit sometimes, but I've never heard it said ever.", "Chick was a straight up entitled spoiled brat. She tried to stretch the story to make herself the victim.", "I see what you did there! \ud83e\udd23 bravo \ud83d\udc4b", "Just admit that if a man doesn't behave perfectly according to your specifications you will hate them it'll save everyone a lot of time.\n\n\n*Maybe you're just a hateful person in general always looking to see the worst in people, in which case I'm sorry for you that sounds like a horrible way to live.", "Where did OP say he was homesick? He said he enjoyed the conversation and kept talking, that's it. The gf meanwhile was surrounded by friends and family celebrating her birthday, its not like he left her sitting in the corner by herself.", "It\u2019s a great way of ruining relationships. Like why do you need to be right? Is being right helping your relationship? Is your SO feeling closer before you\u2019ve prioritized being right over their feelings and their hurt? \n\nAnd it\u2019s one thing to do it one time without realizing it over something minor. But this is often something that comes up a lot and becomes something bigger in a lot of relationships because it happens so often. Like it\u2019s okay to say sorry. It doesn\u2019t even make you \u201cwrong\u201d necessarily. It just means you\u2019re acknowledging that maybe you did something that negatively impacted your partner, you can talk it through. Both people can figure out how to handle it better in the future, and bam, you\u2019ve created a stronger relationship.", "Don\u2019t apologise- you\u2019ll upset him!", "I don't think they literally meant \"Yes my grandmother the matriarch, nothing passes over her and she controls the family.\" I assume they meant it more as in the oldest person that everyone respects and reveres. Someone who is just incredibly important to the family. I'd call my own great grandmother the matriarch of my family because she's the one everyone makes SURE they see for at least a few seconds at the family events.", "Totally the type that would be jealous of grandma getting more attention \ud83d\ude02", "Yes, absolutely agreed! Intentions are REALLY important in relationships, just as important as communication is. It\u2019s wild to see how many people care more about their need to be *right*, than caring about their partner\u2019s emotional needs, and making their loved one feel cared for and understood.", "She probably would have thought he was flirting with grandma and they were having an affair! \ud83e\udd23"]}
