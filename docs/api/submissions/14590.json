All you did was dye your hair green, you didn\u2019t hold her down and force her to dye hers. She\u2019s an adult so she can handle the consequences of her own actions", "I\u2019m so confused why she feels the need to do what you do. \n\n26 is a little too far into adulthood to be this unreasonable?", "NTA\n\nAs someone who regularly dyes my hair, I find this hilarious. Perhaps if she hadn't made a big issue to your family, you might help.\nBut she's an adult, so she can live with the consequences", "Personally, I don't think you owe her your knowledge when she's going out of her way to be shitty to you. I get why you feel a bit guilty about it, and if you want to fix it for her, you do you. You should do what makes you feel happy in this situation, based on yourself. Because you didn't do anything to her, she did it to herself. It's not your muddy mess to fix, unless you decide you want to take that problem on and help her - which she's done nothing to earn imo. This just shows you're a better person than her. If you want to rise even farther above her by helping her out of her own mess, then you're just extra awesome.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, you didn't TRICK her into anything. You made a choice for yourself, based on knowledge you have and she didn't. The fact that she tried to copy you without even making sure she knew what she was doing is her own fault. And somehow, I get the feeling that if she'd just been decent to you, and talked to you straight up about it, you'd be willing to help her out and get her into colors that would work well for her. She's the one that mocked it, refuses to apologize and be honest with it, and won't give you two a chance to bond over a shared interest. That all sounds like a her problem, not a you problem. 100% NTA", "NTA. You never made her dye her hair. She got family members involved making you for saying she was copying you. Then it goes wrong when she copied you and some how it's your fault?! She doesn't mind making you feel bad about yourself and your image. I would leave her. She can go to a professional hairdresser if she wants it fixing.", "Man i love stories like this NTA not like you made her dye it", "NTA\n\nHow could your sister deny the fact that she's copying you when all circumstances prove otherwise?\n\nIs she alright in the head or something? It worries me that a 26-year-old would engage in such childish and outlandish behavior (and end up crying foul play to friends and relatives when things don't go her way).", "Info:  How exactly is it your fault her hair got messed up? Was it because she copied the process for green when she did red? \n\nAlso NTA, if my sibling shit on my looks for 10 years, then decided to dress exactly like me. I don't know about upset, but I sure wouldn't let them forget every time they shit on me.", "NTA.   \nShe got what she deserved. And given it will grow out, there is no real harm.", "How is it possible you tricked her if she's not copying you? Surely it's just a weird coincidence that you coloured your hair green, and she then tried to colour it green too without knowing what she's doing? \n\nNTA. She needs to learn how to be her own person and make herself look how she wants without blindly copying anyone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot your resposnibility. Do YOUR heair, and let her do hers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Not because I\u2019m being berated by some relatives, her friends, and her, for \u201ctricking\u201d her,\" .. ignore those AHS. You did BOTHING to her. You have NOTHING to do with HER hair, you were not involved in her decissions and her hair colouring - and keep it that way.", "NTA - the only thing on your side, is why does it bother you? She's 26 and still needs to copy her big sister (after belittling you for your look). It's sad enough for you to not take offense. Still I wouldn't help her, maybe lesson would be learned.", "Your relatives blame you for \"tricking her\" into dyeing her hair. You did it first and she followed, though failed.\n\nThey know, or must at least acknowledge, the fact that she was \"copying you\" and that your sister therefore did this on her own volition. As an adult, she has the freedom to make her own decisions and very well has the capacity to do her research.\n\nYou did knowingly lead her into this mess, but I wouldn't say you're an ass. I'd say it's pretty damn petty.", "NTA\n\n>she ended up dragging in family members, and a group of her friends to belittle me for \u201cclaiming she was copying me\u201d.\n\n>Not because I\u2019m being berated by some relatives, her friends, and her, for \u201ctricking\u201d her\n\nYour sister can't have it both ways. Either she's copying you or she's not. The people on her side are just enabling her behavior. \n\nIf she's that upset with her hair, she can go to a salon and have it professionally fixed. Maybe the cost will teach her a lesson.", "Imo NTA. I'm so entertained by this though lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My (26f) sister has always made fun of me for it, But over the past year when \u201cgoth girlfriends\u201d became a novelty she started leaning into it, and she made it a habit to use me as \u201cinspiration\u201d. I felt it was getting weird when I finally noticed she was dying her hair and dressing eerily similar to me. I voiced to her that I didn\u2019t appreciate it, considering how condescending she is about it with me. But every time I did, she blew it up into an argument.\nI thought it was childish and petty so I dropped it.\nUntil last month when I bought a deep magenta hair dye. she tagged along, and after seeing what I bought she said she needed to go back into the store for something then came out with the exact hair dye I just bought. I made fun of her for proving me right. She claimed \u2018the sales associate told her to buy it bc it was the ONLY color that would cover her natural red\u2019. (Apparently she doesn\u2019t know how to bleach it.) she ended up dragging in family members, and a group of her friends to belittle me for \u201cclaiming she was copying me\u201d. This is when I decided, as someone who knows how to properly dye hair, and understands color theory.. I wanted green hair.\nFor a month, I asked her when she would use the dye. She refused too, insisting I just go ahead and dye mine. It was the stupidest stand off ever. While I was waiting for my dye to come in the Mail, she was waiting to see what I\u2019d do. 3 days after I dyed my hair green she attempted to dye hers, green. Her hair is now a dingy muddy color, and I told her if she didn\u2019t know how to properly dye her hair she shouldn\u2019t do it anymore. I was going to suggest a process to help her, but I haven\u2019t yet bc she went into a frenzy and dragged everyone back into it. It\u2019s been about a week and I feel bad. Not because I\u2019m being berated by some relatives, her friends, and her, for \u201ctricking\u201d her, but because she\u2019s acting like she\u2019s stuck with her muck\u2026 I know how stupid this all is but I also know how much it can suck being unhappy with your looks. So, I feel bad for causing that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That would also fix the problem until her hair grows out lol.\n\nNTA.", "Did you ever ask her why she keeps copying you?", "are you sure you're 27yo?\n\nbecause you both act like you're 12yo\n\ngrow up", "You both act like brats. \"Mooom, she's copying me!\" \"No, I'm not!\" \"Yes, you are!\" \"No!\"\n\nGrow up, both of you.\nESH.", "ESH. I'd honestly have thought you were teenagers, not women over 25.\n\nI get it's annoying that your sister is copying you and she shouldn't make fun of you for stuff, but for real why do you care so much that she's copying you that you're letting it dictate what colour YOU dye YOUR hair? You're both perpetuating this childish behaviour.", "NTA you are living far too much in each others pockets because there is too much behaviour that is usually at the 18 and 19 age bracket. You need to put your sister and family on information diet. Everyone is in everyone's faces. Unless this is a culture where everyone still lives at home and has to until marriage, in which case good luck with that.", "YTA & ESH. How the hell are you both in your later half of your twenties and still acting like you're twelve?!? Grow the hell up. Honestly, you're both acting like little 7th grade brats. You should be embarrassed.", ">It was the stupidest stand off ever.   \n>  \n>I know how stupid this all is\n\nYes. ESH", "ESH for adults having maturity that would make a 13-year old say \"*dude, grow up!*\".", "Nta. This is funny. But I'd go low contact for a while. There is no reason for this much interaction between you two if you don't enjoy it.", "\"stuck with her muck\"\n\nThis made me giggle.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and brilliant petty revenge too.", "NTA\n\nWell, maybe you are slightly, but it sounds like it's fixable, and you offered to help. If she insists she's not copying you she only has herself to blame.\n\n>Apparently she doesn\u2019t know how to bleach it.\n\nDoes she not wonder why it never looks as good as yours?", "Info: what are the relos blaming you for?", "Some people never grow up. Maturity is a state of mind, not an age point.", "I don't get the YTA. She's not only coping you but she's getting other people involved to belittle you. She's making you think it's not happening when clearly she is copying you. Imagine if this happened in an office rather than two sisters. Sister is gaslighting OP and when she's been caught out it's still OP's fault. Sounds like sister needs to grow up and OP is dealing with a brat the best way you can.", "I too like those kind of stories. There was one where a room mate? was copying OP (iirc it was hair colour & hair styles mostly) so during holidays she pretended to have shaved her hair (using the help of a best friend make up/special effects student/artist) & posted it on her insta, RM predictably copied & OP came home with hair, RM blew up & tried to get the college or dorm managers involved? XD", "Sister denies that she is doing it in the first place. How do you think that exchange will go?", "What? Op did decide what she wanted. She in fact decides first, every time.", "all she did was dye her hair green.", "Yup. My sister copied everything I did into her 30s. This included moving cities, countries, education and career. It only stopped when she couldn\u2019t keep up anymore (some options in life need to be unlocked).", "Some people are just a holes", "But she either has to admit she was copying her sister, or admit that she's entirely responsible for making a mess of her hair.", "Depends how OP asks and will never know until she does.", "And what? She's gonna be angry at every friend she has if they dye their hair the same way she does? Or if they wear the same style clothes? To me it seems like OP just wants to stand out to get attention and her sister is \"ruining it\" by copying her because she's not \"the only quirky and weird one\" in their family anymore.\nThey're both childish and they both suck.", "That isn't all she did.", "It's clear you've never tried to have a logical conversation with someone who gaslights.\n\nAlso, \"we'll\"", "I get that. But I\u2019m bothered by her belittling me for these things, she\u2019s condescending about them and that\u2019s where I\u2019m rubbed the wrong way. I actually think it would be nice to get to dye her hair or shop with her but she\u2019s just a major c*** about it. \nI actually blend in quite well at family gatherings, and amongst friends.", "It\u2019s not about me it\u2019s about OP, her sister and their relationship.", "Definitely NTA. You didn't do anything to her hair. And you should keep it that way.", "Right, my point is you're asking OP to do something fruitless, that they, almost certainly, have already done and received gaslighting in return for their troubles", "Sounds like you have to be right and have the last word. OP is asking for advice etc and I gave my opinion which has nothing to do with you or your experience.", "AITAH really isn't an advice sub, you didn't actually give an opinion, and I think people's experiences do have everything to do with these sorts of judgements\n\nEdit: the rules literally say \"Don't ask for advice\""]}
