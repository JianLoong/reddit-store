But we were both stuffed and I was putting the left overs away and my dog, who had been really sweet and well behaved the entire night was watching me wagging his tail.

He was all I had when I got divorced, when my father was very mentally ill and two weeks ago when my grandfather suddenly passed. And so much more. That damn dog has been the strongest bond I\u2019ve practically ever had. \n\nBut did I let my complacency with my companion allow me to do something in appropriate or rude?
