But we were both stuffed and I was putting the left overs away and my dog, who had been really sweet and well behaved the entire night was watching me wagging his tail.

He was all I had when I got divorced, when my father was very mentally ill and two weeks ago when my grandfather suddenly passed. And so much more. That damn dog has been the strongest bond I\u2019ve practically ever had. \n\nBut did I let my complacency with my companion allow me to do something in appropriate or rude?

It\u2019s a dealbreaker for me. \n\nI know it doesn\u2019t make sense. I know the dishwasher sanitizes the dishes. I know. \n\nIt\u2019s still a dealbreaker for me. \n\nLike peeing in the shower is a dealbreaker for some people. I think everyone has their own gross-out limit, and this is simply a compatibility issue.", "No, we had one of those steps small kids stand on to be tall enough to brush their teeth/use the sink in the bathroom, and that\u2019s what doubled as the puke bowl!", "Every human I know brushes their teeth at least twice a day, dogs not so much. I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t want the remnants of fox shit or dog\u2019s asshole, or whatever else my countryside-living dog\u2019s tongue has been on that day, in my dishwasher regardless of how well the regularly-cleaned dishwasher works. That\u2019s an ick for me.", "An occasional bite is fine. But whole portions? Not so much. And small dogs magnify it a lot more. Go ahead and feed your dog a bunch of fries and then pick it up. After while it\u2019s water will be empty and the dog will be bloated.\n\nThat equals heart failure and it\u2019s cumulative, but whatever", "Yeah, who cares if your best friend lives to be 16 or 10. What difference does it make to you?", "I think most people use two bites and two forkfuls in the same way in this context. It seems very likely he double dipped his dogs saliva into food he was putting in the fridge. That shows a complete lack of food hygiene. While she might have gone overboard with her outward reaction, it's not unreasonable to not to want to date someone who thinks dog saliva in food is just hunky dory.", "Just the thought that it was in a dog's mouth grosses me out", "I understood it as he put two bites worth of food on the fork, gave it to the dog, then put said fork in the washer. If he did it the way you think, yeah that's gross.", "I don't know why using a sink to throw up in upsets me more than the bowl.  But it does.  haha.", "Easily the dumbest comment in here.", "He did say he gave the dog two bites, not a whole portion.", "The post specifically states that he was just giving the dog two bites with the fork, tho, not whole portions.", "To be fair I only ever had large dogs. I obviously wouldn't give them fries but they often cosplay the waste bin and get left over pasta or rice which is obviously cooked with salt. And they are fine.", "Thousands of years of human history say this is bullshit.", "You're projecting your personal issues onto the OP, who specifically stated they gave their dog 2 bites of food.", "So the dog eating two bites of food is going to take away 6 years of life?? Seriously?", "Maybe. OP, clarify?", "Guaranteed if you have ever used a spoon in a dog owner\u2019s house, their dog has likely licked it at some point.", "Yes!!! Me too", "This sounds to me like some form of mysophobia/germophobia.\n\nNot judging, if that's what it is that's totally fine. Just think it could be worth a thought that you fall into that spectrum.", "Aha sorry I meant to say we used the step thing as the sick bowl! Definitely never the sink :o", "I had to throw up in the sink a few months ago because I knew if I moved, I wouldn't have made it the 3 feet to the toilet. Baptized it in pinesol and drainer cleaner afterwards.", "Ah I see basic hygiene is not high on your list of priorities. That\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not for everyone!", "That thought turned my stomach", "If someone were to vomit or have some other bodily fluid get onto your bed, are you throwing away the bed? Or are you just cleaning it and continuing to use it?", "I don\u2019t think you grasp basic biology", "Ah, I see the difference between accidents and deliberate actions has not registered with you yet. That\u2019s okay, there\u2019s time.", "And I think letting my dog lick her arse then my forks is disgusting. You\u2019re free to live your own grim life.", "So your version basic hygiene only applies to deliberate actions and not accidents?", "I\u2019m not going to deliberately vomit on my bed. Nor am I going to deliberately let my dog lick my forks. You\u2019re free to do both, if you wish.", "So you're only worried about remnants if the action was deliberate as opposed to accidental. Ok then, you're free to think that way I guess."]}
