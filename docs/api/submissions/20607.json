Unless I am missing something in your post, there does not seem to be any reason she couldn\u2019t use her own instead of yours.  Who cares how expensive it it, the point is to use it so you don\u2019t get sunburned.", "NTA\n\nI was initially leaning toward you being the asshole, but upon hearing the details your friend is just an idiot.", "NTA. If I'm reading this correctly, she had her own sunscreen to use, so there is no reason why you would be to blame if she chose not to use it and got burnt. I would tell her she is more than welcome to use your sunscreen if she would like to venmo you for half the cost.", "NTA she had her own sunscreen, she only has herself to blame. Stupid is, as stupid does.", "NTA. She's behaving like an entitled brat and treating you like support staff.", "nta. she has sunscreen, she chose not to use it.", "NTA. She had sunscreen and chose not to use it. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s your problem in the slightest.", "NTA. \"Okay. Let me use your sunscreen and lunch will be on me?\" Is how friends handle that situation. She didn't treat you like a friend, she treated you like her staff. Friends don't exist to fix the trouble we cause ourselves. Friends look out for each other, but they don't serve us.", "NTA - Alternatively, you could charge her $5 to use yours.", "NTA. Her blaming you for her sunburn makes about as much sense as her not using her own sunscreen because it's too expensive. This friend isn't strong on logical thinking, is she?", "NTA. She has sunscreen. If she doesn't put it on, then tough luck for her.", "NTA - She\u2019s irresponsible and selfish", "NTA...but it feels odd to go on a trip with someone you are not close friends with", "Not a child.

Greedy as well as stupid!", "Correction to your title: your friend refused to use her own sunscreen which led to her getting sunburnt.\n\nNTA", "What kind of sunscreen are you using that costs $30 a bottle?

Some people are just takers, they will take and take until you stop giving. She's probably had this kind of thing enabled her entire life, so she thinks it's normal. It's not, and the burned legs are a good reminder. Maybe her sunscreen isn't cheap, but it's cheaper than the procedures she will have to get if she gets skin cancer. She needs to cough up and shut up like the rest of us.", "NTA", "No She had her own sunscreen.", "YWBTA if you gave her sunscreen.

You kindly covered for her (pun not intended) the first couple of times. Sooner or later you can decide you won't carry others who aren't pulling their own weight.

I would recommend teaching her how sunblock works.", "no thats the reasoning. she just said that her sunscreen is too expensive to use to cover her whole body so she just thought a better idea would be to use mine ://", "Not that it excuses anything, but I\u2019d guess her own was an expensive facial sunscreen based on the comment that it was too expensive to put on her entire body.\n\nShe still should have just bought her own at the nearest store and OP is NTA.", "Agree", "It might. It might be less greasy or more moisturising. Skin care stuff can be expensive and although sometimes that\u2019s just snake oil, other times a quality product costs more.", "Sounds like she should have bought cheaper sunscreen.", "exactly. why splurge on a sunscreen if u cant even afford to use properly", "NTA. Sunscreen is not like fine wine - it doesn't get better with age ....", "Nta. The sunscreen I buy IS expensive because it's 70spf. I need that strength so I don't get hyperpigmentation on my face.
