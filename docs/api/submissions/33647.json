I felt the gift in the wrapping and could tell he got me a book, which was great because I love to read. \"OH!! It's a book, yay! Thank you!!\" His response was \"Well, I don't know if it's a good gift...\" so I then said, \"Don't worry babe, I'm sure it'll be fine!\"\n\nExcept it wasn't fine.\nHe got me a book on etiquette. It said \"Etiquette\" in big capital letters on the cover, and on the bottom it said \"Manners for today.\" It also had a post it note on it (I can't remember all the text off the top of my head) but what stood out to me was \"I asked chatGPT...etc etc.\" I was so mortified, and humiliated. But mostly stunned. Not only was the gift tactless, he used an AI for advice on a Christmas gift for his girlfriend, which made me even more angry because I am an artist and he knows my thoughts on AI.\n\nI was so stunned and I didn't say anything. It was like when you give a hated or disliked gift to an NPC in Stardew Valley and you get the \"oh...thanks...\" except in real time, with a sad or indifferent portrait as my face. I couldn't hold it in anymore and I started to cry. He came over to me and asked if anything was wrong and I said no, and that I just wanted to please be left alone. He went upstairs and left me alone.\n\n A little while later he came back and said he was sorry. I didn't say anything. He went back upstairs. I eventually  opened the book and read a little bit. I was watching a video on my phone and he came back down and apologized again and said he'll return it. I've been sitting on my feelings  and he kept coming and making attempts to talk to me so I said \"Just leave it there! I actually started reading it, so don't return it. That's what you got it for, right? Because you thought I needed it.\" He didn't say anything and went back upstairs.\n\nI just slept on the couch for the night. We haven't said anything to each other today except for me texting him that I was heading out and I took an uber to work. I'm most likely going to take an uber home. I'm not really angry anymore, just feeling still feeling sad and humiliated. I feel like my Christmas is ruined. I no longer feel very jolly and quite frankly I don't even want to open my remaining presents. he apologized but it doesn't make me feel any better. I'm supposed to be going to a Christmas dinner with him to his extended family's house, and I don't even feel like going anymore. I'll be going anyway because they already know I'm coming. If I didn't live an hour away I would be going home after tomorrow's shift.\n\nTL;DR boyfriend got me a tactless gift for Christmas, which was an instruction manual for better manners.\n\nEDITED FOR CONTEXT: I regularly talk to my boyfriend and request things in a polite tone without saying please all the time. I feel like the please should be inflected. Also, the AI thing: I am a creator and my stance is AI takes away from writers/artists. He has rubbed in my face on how instead of doing original art for a potential VN project, I should just have AI do it.

If you have to warn someone about the gift you got them you know you did a bad job, he clearly just couldn\u2019t be bothered to put any effort in. I mean *come on* he used ChatGPT and he basically said he thinks you need lessons in etiquette, he may as well have gifted someone struggling with weight gain a gym membership. \n\nIt\u2019s rude and thoughtless and personally I would skip dinner with the in laws and go home", "NTA this is a rude-ass-passive-aggressive gift. You say that he\u2019s brought up wanting you to change some of your phrasing in every day conversation and you\u2019ve told him your opinion on that so he\u2019s no stranger to your views? This makes this gift even more rude and unnecessary. A self help book for Christmas? He can\u2019t be serious\u2026 and one that regurgitates previous arguments?

Spend christmas with your family or by yourself to reflect on this incident.\n\nYou two have only been 5 months together and he pulls something like that. Then you got angry and weren\u2019t feeling secure enough to tell him that you did not like his gift. You ignored him instead of using your words. You actually did the same thing he did to you, you passive-aggressive instead of using your words.\n\nThere is not a lot to unpack there and I strongly suggest not waiting any longer to learn how to communicate with each other. \n\nGood luck.\n\nEDIT: Tell his family that you won\u2019t be coming anymore due to family issues in yours.

There are about a million things he could have given you that are appropriate and widely accepted for a new relationship but he went out of his way to get you something he knew you wouldn\u2019t like.

That\u2019s honestly the best scenario I can see for this gift. You need to decide if it\u2019s worth having a serious conversation about this, to find out his actual reasoning and make it clear you won\u2019t put up with this sort of behaviour, or if you just want to end things now.

I felt the gift in the wrapping and could tell he got me a book, which was great because I love to read. \"OH!! It's a book, yay! Thank you!!\" His response was \"Well, I don't know if it's a good gift...\" so I then said, \"Don't worry babe, I'm sure it'll be fine!\"\n\nExcept it wasn't fine.\nHe got me a book on etiquette. It said \"Etiquette\" in big capital letters on the cover, and on the bottom it said \"Manners for today.\" It also had a post it note on it (I can't remember all the text off the top of my head) but what stood out to me was \"I asked chatGPT...etc etc.\" I was so mortified, and humiliated. But mostly stunned. Not only was the gift tactless, he used an AI for advice on a Christmas gift for his girlfriend, which made me even more angry because I am an artist and he knows my thoughts on AI.\n\nI was so stunned and I didn't say anything. It was like when you give a hated or disliked gift to an NPC in Stardew Valley and you get the \"oh...thanks...\" except in real time, with a sad or indifferent portrait as my face. I couldn't hold it in anymore and I started to cry. He came over to me and asked if anything was wrong and I said no, and that I just wanted to please be left alone. He went upstairs and left me alone.\n\n A little while later he came back and said he was sorry. I didn't say anything. He went back upstairs. I eventually  opened the book and read a little bit. I was watching a video on my phone and he came back down and apologized again and said he'll return it. I've been sitting on my feelings  and he kept coming and making attempts to talk to me so I said \"Just leave it there! I actually started reading it, so don't return it. That's what you got it for, right? Because you thought I needed it.\" He didn't say anything and went back upstairs.\n\nI just slept on the couch for the night. We haven't said anything to each other today except for me texting him that I was heading out and I took an uber to work. I'm most likely going to take an uber home. I'm not really angry anymore, just feeling still feeling sad and humiliated. I feel like my Christmas is ruined. I no longer feel very jolly and quite frankly I don't even want to open my remaining presents. he apologized but it doesn't make me feel any better. I'm supposed to be going to a Christmas dinner with him to his extended family's house, and I don't even feel like going anymore. I'll be going anyway because they already know I'm coming. If I didn't live an hour away I would be going home after tomorrow's shift.\n\nTL;DR boyfriend got me a tactless gift for Christmas, which was an instruction manual for better manners.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then screen shot it, advise who, what, when, where, how, all the deets so the person getting it won't screw it up.\n\nFor example, I have the same type of yoghurt everyday, hubby knows I have yoghurt everyday. But if he happens to do the shopping instead of me, I know I gotta send him a picture of the yoghurt I have everyday or I'm ending up with something I ain't going to like. Not because he doesn't love me, or not because he doesn't care. It's just I know what I like and I gotta let him know what I like so we are on the same page, communicating.\n\nI know it can be nice to get a surprise but again some people suck at giving them. Or think they have it right but they just keep grabbing the wrong yoghurt.\n\nHonestly and I'm saying this with best intentions.\n\nDon't sweat the small stuff, this is so very small. I know it feels big, but it really isn't.\n\nIt's a fuck up but I highly doubt it was intentional and it can be fixed.", "I read this post and had to go check the ages again myself - 31! Holy crap!

Get the stick out of your butt. \nAlso, she was hurt, she asked for time alone and he disregarded that completely. Continuing to try to apologize when someone has asked for space is not only controlling but it is complete disregard of the other person's wants.

There is an element of denied time alone or time with others in controlling behaviours, but that doesn't mean that checking up on someone to apologise and leave them be again despite them stating they wanted to be alone is controlling.
