I definitely recommend just going away on holiday every year or two - gives you and your family a bit of peace and quiet, and subtly signals to MiL that she doesn't get to call *all* the shots.", "Tell him you won\u2019t leave your own home and that he\u2019s more than welcome to leave with his stuff to his mommas.", "NTA. Where does your husband get the idea that his Mommy\u2019s needs are paramount?", "Nta,\nAnd your husband needs to be clear with his mom.  The other option is to tell her one year with your family one with his for both days.  Starting with your family this year.", "Maybe after this season you both start your own traditions. Is it really fair for a chi to be schlepped around during Christmas, unable to play with the toys they got?\n\nNTA", "Is this common? Him picking his mother? Cause he\u2019s not on your side.", "No, you need to put your foot down and tell them from now on you wither split or alternate - one day here, one day there or one year with his family and one year with yours. In fact, you should be spending the next 3 with your family to make up for the last 3 years. Your in-laws can say what they want, your husband is the issue here. What he is asking for is very entitled, selfish and self centered. Be careful he's not like that the rest of the year, op.", "Whoa so he doesn't have your back and insists on putting his family over yours?! Maybe take this Xmas eve to move out\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are doing the right thing. You're dividing a holiday between two families. The bigger problem is that your husband is a momma's boy. You split the holidays. That's what it means to blend families. It means things change. MIL and DH need to get over it and split. Or, you can go to your parents when you want for the holidays and bring the kid. Then meet up with DH at his momma's later.", "NTA. They're trying to minimize your family. 50/50 or don't visit them at all and see how they like it.", "NTA\n\nOP your husband isn't taking his mom's side. The truth is that they're on the same team.\n\nHe wants his childhood family to come first. You are a second class citizen to your husband, husband's family and even underneath your own roof.\n\nBased off your comments, your husband is manipulating you into giving into his will. He threatened to kick you out of your own house. Stop defending him. You don't even have a marriage to stand up for at this point.\n\nOP this isn't a case of your husband or his family not understanding that you want to see your family too. The truth is that they don't want your family to exist at all. They know they are wrong. They're just trying to see how much you will continue to hurt yourself to please them. Then your child will start to become just like them. They don't deserve you, it won't stop at just Christmas. You deserve better. Your husband just showed you his true colors when he threatened to kick you out...now erase him.", "NTA \nOne year his family, one year your family.  He\u2019s gotten 3 years, so you get the next 3.  Don\u2019t spend all your time driving here and there.  Just make it a simple for you as possible to spend it with your family.  Take your kid and go.   Tell your husband he\u2019d better join you and leave it at that.  Don\u2019t fight.  Just lay down the law. Tell him your family is important to you, just like his is to him.  That your desires are just as valid as his and it is only fair for your turn.  I\u2019d watch out that he doesn\u2019t take your kid to his folks.", "She needs to stand down . NTA.", "NTA. Tell mil this is what she gets and if she keeps complaining you\u2019ll happily spend Both days with your family.", "Honestly. I would do Christmas Eve with one, the day after Christmas with the other (we call it Boxing Day here in the UK) and Christmas just for your family.", "NTA\n\nyou and your baby can visit your side on Xmas eve, your hubby can go to his on Xmas eve. The. You and your baby can go see his side on Xmas day for breakfast \n\nStand your ground woman.", "NTA, your husband sure is though. Don\u2019t back down.", "NTA at all. Don't let them make you feel like one. You are trying to do the right thing.", "NTA. But I saw your comment about him ordering you out of the house and honestly pack up your kid and take yourselves to your parents and reevaluate if this relationship is worth it", "NTA\n\nWe made a rule we don't travel on Christmas Day. My mom always tries to push this. We hold firm.", "NTA. Your husband and MIK both need to realize that both sides of the family need holiday time (unless one of yiu is NC with your family). Growing up, my moms side always had Christmas Eve, and dads side had Christmas Day. As moms side (where all of my cousins were) all got older/married/had kids/divorced, it got more complicated, so we moved our celebration to the weekend before the holiday. It\u2019s all about compromise and figuring what works best for the majority.", "Toxic husband as well", "That's NOT being on your side", "You realize you have a husband problem. Stand on your ground.", "That was done by design....", "Tell him he is more than welcome to do Grandparents dinner - you and the baby will be at your grandparents", "No. HE has ruined your marriage. He is already married to momma.", "WTH? Sort of burying the lede. NTA, of course, but get out of there and spend holidays with your family...and maybe a divorce attorney.", "Take the baby and go. DTMFA. This will be your life forever.", "Why on earth should YOU be the one to leave?? If he wants out, HE should leave.", "NTA but I think it\u2019s important for you to point out to your hubby, and possibly MIL, that if you were to get divorced, there is a disproportionately high probability that you would get 50/50 custody. So\u2026.she can either take her half now or chance visitation on alternating years through the courts. But I\u2019ve been known to be a petty biotchhhhh so that might just be me\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I would tell your husband that you\u2019ve been thinking about \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d and you\u2019ve changed your mind. Sharing the holiday, while sounding good, isn\u2019t appropriate after all.  Since you\u2019ve seen only his family for the past three years, you and babe will spend your next three Christmases with just your family.", "NTA. Your husband is being super duper unreasonable. If it comes down to it, take your kid and visit your family on Christmas Eve and your husband can throw a tantrum and go crying to mommy.", "NTA simple, don\u2019t go. \nGo see your family", "NTA. \n\nAbsolutely positively put your foot down on this. I went through this shit. My MIL\u2019s attitude was almost as if they \u201cowned\u201d me now that I\u2019m married to my husband. Every holiday has to be spent with them. I put a stop to it. She was unhappy and the only thing I asked her was \u201cso you are saying that my family is not as important as my husband\u2019s family? Can you explain the reasoning behind it?\u201d She knew she cannot answer that question without being a complete asshole. Next year she went away to \u201cteach us a lesson.\u201d My husband and I didn\u2019t give a shit and it was the best holiday, lol!", "No. It's not just about them. If you want to be petty say \"Sure. We can go to the Christmas Eve meal. But we'll have to leave Christmas Breakfast early and drop by my parents before returning to your parents for evening.\" Smile.", "NTA When hubs and I got married 30+ years ago, we split the holidays. One year, Thanksgiving with his family. The next, with mine.  Christmas Eve was always when my extended family got together so it made sense to make that the day we spent Christmas with my family and Christmas Day with his. When we had our child, things changed a bit. Christmas morning was our time and then we would go over there. When we moved, once again things changed but we always tried for balance. Never has either family insisted that we spend every holiday with just them.", "NTA but based on comments take the kid, enjoy Christmas with your family and go NC until you get back. He\u2019s a major AH and so is his mommy. I can\u2019t stand monster in laws or their \u201cbaby\u201d boys", "I would\u2019ve packed up and called his bluff on this. He would\u2019ve come home and i would\u2019ve been gone.", "Cool, cool. So now you take your one year old, you pack your bags, and you spend ALL of both Christmas Eve and Christmas with your side of the family!\n\nWhile you\u2019re at it, ask your parents if staying with them long-term is an option, since it seems like your husband is already married to mommy and doesn\u2019t need another wife.", "Srsly. Fck ur husband. You do not want this man as ur husband anymore trust.", "Better yet, have his crap packed and on the doorstep with the locks changed and paperwork ready. This guy needs to go! Who the f*** does he think he is?\n\nOP, you are not the AH, but your husband and his family are!", "You don\u2019t have to go any where you do t want to go.", "Any updates?", "Go to ur families then fake sick and stay home Christmas. That MIL sounds like a nightmare and it\u2019s only gonna get worse as you have more babies. Control control control. NTA", "NTA, but I'm sorry to say. You married a mama's boy. And your MIL, will always try to be controlling \"your\" life and your child's.", "You seriously need a mediator.  A licensed therapist will definitely help.\n\nYou guys definitely deserve to both be heard and given a vote.  I'm with others, this needs to stop now.\n\nNow my own take on fall/winter holidays. \n\nFor me Thanksgiving is for celebrating with extended family, but Christmas is special to me to be an intimate affair.   My partner and I don't have human children but we have dogs.  But if we did have kids we would have stuck to the plan we have in place right now. \n\nIt's time for you guys to create your own family traditions. \n\nLots of families will have Christmas day in an intimate setting,  parents and kids only, then have Christmas evening with grandparents etc.\n\nThe question is, what traditions do you guys want to create fir yourselves? \n\nTherapy before this gets out of hand.", "I think you should interpret his comment as his wanting you to get to spend the holidays with your family.", "Woah. That is a serious red flag. In fights, there are some places partners just cannot go. Ordering YOU to leave your family home???? It would be bad enough if he threatened to walk out, but telling you to get out takes this to a whole new level. Seriously. I don\u2019t know how you patched things up that time, but this is a major issue with him and how little he respects you."]}
