The issue is, my MIL is disappointed that we will be missing his grandparents Christmas Eve dinner because we will be with my family. It has caused a fight.

My MIL has always ran around and been extremely busy on Christmas and that isn\u2019t something I want. I want to spend equal amounts of time with both sides of the family as well as having our own family time (just me, my husband and our child).
