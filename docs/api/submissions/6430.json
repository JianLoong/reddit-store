He walked out on us when I was pregnant with 9F. He has been in and out of their lives since, he doesn\u2019t pay anything towards them. I haven\u2019t cut him off from them because at the end of the day they are still his daughters and he had a right to see them, they have also said they want to see him. He usually sees them when they are at their gran\u2019s (his mum\u2019s), its never arranged. He\u2019s usually dropping in to borrow money off her.\n\nI am now married to Seb and I have another daughter and a son with him. Seb has been apart of their lives for 8 years. Seb had never intended to take the father role for them as he had step dads forcing themselves into the role when he didn\u2019t want them. The girls accepted him straight away, and started calling him dad when he moved in with us.\n\nBoth of them refer to Seb as their dad and refer to their bio father by his actual name (Dean) and call him Dean to his face. To begin with Seb would ask them to call him Seb because he didn\u2019t want to step on Dean\u2019s toes. However when 12F made him a father\u2019s day card and told him that because he did everything for her that her friend\u2019s dads did for them that he was her dad. We\u2019ve stopped correcting it.\n\nBy chance, I saw Dean when I was commuting to work before Christmas and he was furious about the girls continuing to call Seb dad and Dean by his name. I tried explaining it was a choice they had made because of his actions and that if he had a problem with it, he might want to start treating them better to earn the title of dad. He called me a fucking bitch and walked off. Then at Christmas, the girls were visiting their gran as their uncle James and cousins were visiting for Christmas. I got a call from 9F asking me to come and pick them up as they wanted to come home. Dean had turned up, drunk, and had a go at both of them for calling Seb dad. James threw Dean out of the house while gran and the cousins tried to calm the girls down but the damage was done and they wanted to come home. I picked them up. I have now been sent a letter telling me that Dean is intending to take me to court to get custody and for parental alienation, post marked early in December it was delayed due to the post strikes. Their gran is telling me that it\u2019s my fault for letting them disrespect Dean. James understand where I am coming from but thinks that to keep the peace, they should have called Dean dad to his face even if he doesn\u2019t deserve it. I don\u2019t feel like that its my place to decide what they call Dean and Seb, it\u2019s theirs.  \n\nAITA for letting my girls call their stepdad dad?", "created_utc": 1672791926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102oj7i/aita_for_letting_my_daughters_refer_to_their/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being called **Dad** is a title that is earned and if he hasn\u2019t earned it it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but his own. When my wife and I got married we both had kids from separate relationships. I never pressured my son to call me dad I accepted whatever he was comfortable with. 3 years into being married he started calling me Dad and has been that way for the past 4 years. His biological father is not in the picture and I didn\u2019t not want to overstep. If your daughters are calling Seb Dad it\u2019s cause Seb has earned it. Your ex needs to man the fuck up and accept his shortcomings and fix it by being present, not blowing up on them and pushing them away.", "NTA. This is about Dean\u2019s ego. I will say that many people think it\u2019s disrespectful to call a parent by their first name. It\u2019s like your girls are taking a dig at him in a passive aggressive way. I can see why they would but it does stir up shit.", "NTA but you need a solicitor. We can tell you you're not an asshole but that may mean nothing in court.", "NTA. Biology, a parent does not make. Sounds like Seb earned it from his oldest children.", "NTA - Its the girl's choice \nSeb is there for them , he loves and does everything for his girls \nDean is not a dad at all , he will not get anything", "I absolutely think NTA...if the girls feel Seb is more a father to them than bio dad, they absolutely have that right.  Your ex sounds exhausting, tbh.", "NTA.  I'm glad you have records showing how he hasnt been involved.  Get a good lawyer for yourself as I have seen people get screwed over due to the other parent having an amazing, overpriced lawyer.", "Now you can use that court date to get child support! Yay!", "NTA your children have made the choice to call your partner their Dad. It sounds like he's earned the title by playing a decent role as a parent. This can't be said for their biological father though. From your comments about the postal strike, it sounds like you are in UK. If you have custody then the family court will look to see if you are positively promoting their biological father as a parent. However, this does not include insisting that they call him Dad. The court will also seek to put the interest and welfare of your children over all other considerations. From what you have said then he's not having a positive impact on their lives and it will be easy for you to demonstrate that. Furthermore, he's opened the door for a Child Maintenance Service claim. If he wants to go for custody, which he has no chance of getting, then you should claim through CMS. They can force him to pay and take steps to deduct it straight from his salary or benefits.", "NTA. \n\nThe biological dad wasn\u2019t their for the kids, but the step dad was. You would definitely not be the AH for letting your girls call their stepdad dad. \n\nAs well as that, the bio dad really does not sound like he deserves to be anywhere near the kids.
