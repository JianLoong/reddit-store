At this point she was engaged and a lot of our conversations on the walk centered around her wedding. She had told me she had a falling out with a bridesmaid and shortly after I was invited to be in the wedding. I was quite shocked as I didn\u2019t consider us nearly close enough for that but I accepted. I always felt like I was only included as a way to keep the sides even and to replace the woman that had dropped out. As the wedding neared she became a disaster. Bossing her bridal party around, planning her own bachelorette and bridal shower and having the bridal party pick up the bill. She actually planned a lavish and expensive out of state air bnb, had us all pay for it and then canceled it to change plans after the date we could get a refund. \n\nThat was all 2 years ago. I am now engaged and planning my own wedding. We are planning a very small and intimate destination wedding for immediate family and lifelong close friends only, so she has not been invited. She has posted some passive aggressive comments on Facebook that I know are directed at me and her lack of invite. We both moved out of our old building over a year ago and have never talked since, some simple comment exchanges on social media but no texting, phone calls or seeing each other.
