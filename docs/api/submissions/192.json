As a mom I just saw $$$.  Something like a suit is something I would want to buy my son for multiple occasions. The cufflinks and lacrosse tie I would be okay with.  The NFL suit jacket I would have said no to as well.\n\nAlthough it is perfectly acceptable for your wedding, it would not be the case for a funeral or say a confirmation at church.  \n\nMy sister and I are very close to eachothers kids as well.  They get away with a lot when they are with an aunt.  The only rule we have is if the parents say no, it is an end to the conversation.\n\nYou meant well and wanted your nephew to be comfortable.  But in all honestly at the reception, the suit jacket is going to spend the night hanging on the back of a chair.", "**Gentle YTA**\n\nI get that your intentions are good, and even the underlying idea of kids being able to express themselves through clothing. But you're missing the fact that this isn't just about you or your wedding.\n\n1) I assume that the 13-year-old isn't paying for his own wedding attire, and neither are you. And most sports-themed gear, ESPECIALLY official NFL/NBA/MLB/etc. athletic gear, is SUPER EXPENSIVE. Did you even look at the price of this NFL-team-branded blazer that he wants his parents to pay for? Is it reasonably priced for a 13-year-old relative to say, a standard sports jacket for a kid that age? \n\n2) Where else do you think he's going to be able to wear an NFL-team themed blazer? Sure, you're fine for him wearing it to your wedding. That's one occasion. But he's 13, and probably doesn't go to a lot of fancy things. And it's NOT necessarily appropriate if he gets invited to another occasion. So what happens then? His parents have put out potentially a lot of money for a blazer that he's only going to wear one time? And then they have to buy him ANOTHER suit or sports jacket if he gets invited somewhere else where the dress code isn't as relaxed or \"artsy\"? Again, are you going to pick up any of the costs here? Is he?\n\n3) Encouraging creativity is wonderful, but it's also really important to teach teenagers, whose default tends to be egocentrism - not out of selfishness but because that's how they're wired, to be impulsive and see the world from only their own perspective - that they are not the centre of the universe, that they are part of a social community, that their feelings matter but also that as part of a social society we work as a team and sometimes we consider rules and etiquette that go beyond our personal preferences and \"reflecting our creativity in our clothing\". It's a balance. So maybe the solution is going to be cool cufflinks and a lacrosse tie (i.e. accessories that reflect his personal aesthetic preferences) with a more standard/appropriate blazer or sports jacket that is more versatile. \n\nYTA for prioritizing being the \"cool aunt\" right off the bat, without considering that your sister's concerns might not just be her being \"uncool\" or \"uptight\" but actually trying to be practical and a good parent. And think beyond the one occasion of your wedding. Parenting is having to think 10 steps ahead, and you just made her life way more difficult because you don't have to do any of the heavy lifting she does and can just think about the fun parts. You owe her an apology.", "<<He told us his mom said no>>\n\nYTA. This is classic kid behaviour, running to another resource (Mom vs Dad, parents vs grandparents, etc.) when you've already been given your answer.\n\nYour response **at most** should have been \"Well, let me touch base with your mother about it.\" And even that might be crossing the line for her, *depending on your history with the kids* here.\n\nAs for the lunch, you also took a page out of your nephew's book by resorting to the other childish method of getting what you want---asking permission, in front of the decision maker and the involved party, so they'll be the asshole if they refuse. (\"Mom, can Jimmy spend the night?\")", "Gentle YTA.\n\nYou got played and you undermined your sister. \n\nI get that you\u2019re fine with the outfit but he asked his *parent*, they said no, so he triangulated and went to you. Kids often do this between their parents to try to get their way. Mom says no so they go to Dad or visa versa. Parents have to be aligned and support each other. Else it sets up a pretty manipulative dynamic. \n\nI\u2019d apologize to your sister. You did undermine her trying to get kid to wear situationally appropriate attire. And while you may think it\u2019s fine, she\u2019s also right that some people are going to think she\u2019s got poor judgment for letting her kid go to a formal event in that attire.

Your sister's approval is just as important as your approval of his outfit. I had to read your response carefully to fully understand why your sister was upset. And yes, I would be upset if I said no to my son and my sibling overrules me.", "Very slight YTA. You get to decide what you'll allow at your wedding, but they still get to decide what they think is acceptable for their kids. As soon as he told you that his mom didn't like it, you should have talked to her before giving the okay.

Is this something they could DIY using a thrift store blazer? OP seems to be on board with that.\n\nRegardless, if sis\u2019s whole mission was to ensure nephew chose a more conservative look, then inviting her artsy sibling into the conversation was a bad call.

Anyway, just an idea.\n\nMy judgement is NAH, as I don't see anyone acting like an asshole yet. OP got caught by the nephew's \"parent-shopping\", but OP doesn't have any teenage kids so shouldn't be expected to be an expert at navigating those waters. Kid gets points for his negotiating skills, and more for having the smarts to crowdsource his solution. Plus a few bonus points for not throwing a tantrum over it (13 is a volatile age. I bet I'd have thrown a tantrum).\n\nI just think all of you need to sit down together, talk about the money involved, and brainstorm how to handle things. Maybe if nephew hears he can get half the NFL-suit money added to his next birthday he'll be willing to force himself into a traditional suit for one afternoon? Another probably-useless idea. :)\n\nAnyway, seems to me there are lots of options and no major damage has been done. Talk through it honestly.

In this case, as you have not banned more formal dress, than you should not have told the kid anything.  Mom said no, and her default would still fit your guidelines (that is, he's more \"normal dressy\" and you don't prohibit that).  So in that case, you should have said \"mom is the boss\".  I mean, what the heck did you think would happen when the kid says \"mom says no, what do you say\"?  You stepped into the bear trap HARD on that one.\n\nNow, the ULTIMATE blame is on mom.  Like so many parents these days, she has no spine.  For a 13 year old, they should know right away that NO means NO.  Frankly, she never should have told you at all.

In every formal event I went, they were wearing jeans and a shirt, or even a T-shirt, and maybe a fancy hairstyle. That's all.\nHow is he gonna get a suit because of \"the budget\"? He's 13!!! He's GROWING, and, until 15, he will grow a lot. I don't know where do you come from, but 13 y-o around here don't usually get invited to a lot of events where \"formal clothing\" is required.\nMoreover, HE'S A TEENAGER.

Maybe they attend church and they want him to have a suit for that. There may be other weddings or a big birthday or an landmark anniversary where he needs an actual suit.

A team blazer sounds expensive and less \"reusable\" for future events, but ties and cufflinks can be reused or switched depending on context. And I agree OP should have talked to mom and tried to negotiate without having nephew present, even though I can see the point of letting him explain in his own words why this was important to him.", "Also, as a parent, just because it is okay for your wedding doesn\u2019t mean it will be okay for the next formal event he needs a jacket and a tie for. With several kids, it\u2019s likely that outfits need to be worn more than one time or for one event. \n\nAlso, it is a parenting lesson. Your wedding is cute and eclectic. Not every wedding is cute and eclectic.", "I don't think she did undermine his mom. Unless I'm reading it wrong, she didn't say \"your mom will buy that for you\" or \"your mom should buy that for you\", just \"I think it's totally appropriate for my wedding and I love it\". She gave him the facts.

Just sounds like OP's sister wanted to uphold needless formality. So, yeah, she is wrong.", "This.

I know what it\u2019s like to really want to play music (metal) and have a mom turn me down cause it bothered her. It\u2019s sucked. And all it did was take away 4 years of practice and advancement. I think OP would know it\u2019s like taking away her paints, pencils and paper. I could be wrong though.", ">Unfortunately, YTA.\n\nThe sister's approval is not as important considering it was based on how it \"reflects\" on her at a wedding where people are encouraged to dress in a way that reflects/expresses themself.  As long as the kid didn't want to wear something graphic, she had no real reason to turn down the outfit (aside from maybe cost).", "I'm not sure why you seem to think OP needed to clear what she told her nephew what her opinion is on what clothing is acceptable at her wedding.  OP's sister always had veto rights.  She may not have wanted the argument with her son, but OP is under no obligation to lie to her nephew for any reason.  What do you think would happen to any trust OP built with her nephew when he inevitably finds out she lied to him about a time he was trying to establish his sense of identity?  \n\nYour only concern is making moms life easier, but the cost is OP's relationship with her nephew.  How exactly is that right?", "Absolutely!! \n\nThis could have been avoided by speaking to his mom first before agreeing and telling her you and fianc\u00e9 had no issues with the outfit he had selected to wear to the wedding. \n\nParents are the ones funding the outfit. What if they can\u2019t afford it?", "Oh, come on, the kid's trying to wear a goofy costume to a wedding, not come out of the closet.", "He didn't overrule anything. He asked OP for her opinion, OP gave it to him. The sister is asking her for a lie, just for making it more comfortable for her.", "From my read of them, a lot of it is people thinking its ok to treat a 13 year old like they're 5.\n\nIt does all seem to be \"how dare you overrule a parent in their parenting\". What I think they're also overlooking is a good part of why the nephew went to OP in the first place. He knew his aunt's opinion on the matter and that what he was interested in was actually ok in her book.\n\nI get that sis was trying to teach her son about \"appropriate wedding attire\". But, imo, as a parent of teens myself, she was going about it the wrong way.\n\nInstead of trying to dictate his outfit, this should have been a couple of conversations. First, with her son (and the other teens) about dressing to the occasion, how different weddings can have different expectations and how wildly those dress codes can vary. Second, with OP to clarify what her expectations were.\n\nDictating as a way of \"teaching\" in this sort of social occasion doesn't teach. It as likely just creates either rebels that won't dress up at all, or people so stuck on one way of doing things that they can't change, as it does at people who navigate the differences appropriately.", "Ok, hypothetical situation that I admit is much more extreme but still illustrates my point: kid comes out of the closet, parents dont approve. Kid asks aunt if she approves. If the aunt doesnt disapprove, should she lie to the kid anyway just to not overrule his parents? No, of course not. In this case, the mom gave a reason for her decision that was straight up false. Should the aunt have also lied and said it wasnt appropriate just because the mom said so? Giving her opinion is NOT overruling. Overruling would be buying the outfit herself and giving it to the kid before the wedding against the parents wishes. She disagreed with mom, she didn't overrule her.", "NTA !!!! \n\nwhy would a 13 y/o's mom get to decide what they choose to wear, ESPECIALLY since the outfit was cleared with the bride?! i can't imagine the control issues this person has. at 13 you should be able to have some semblance of bodily autonomy, not \"mommy has to approve of my wedding outfit\"\n\nmy mind is blown by all the y/t/a comments", "Thank you! I really don't understand why everyone's saying they're the AH here.\n\nI feel like a lot of the commenters here aren't understanding that *OP's sister did not have to say yes.*\n\nMany people said money might have been an issue. I'm sorry, but if it was a money issue, I have a hard time believing OP's sister would've agreed to it.\n\nOh but his brother could wear a suit down the line! Okay, but he could also wear this down the line, so what's your point?\n\nBut let's be real: none of that was her concern. The first thing she brought up was how it might have reflected *on her.* OP's sister doesn't care about cost, practicality, etc. She isn't concerned with anything but her own image and I'm sorry, but she can go cry a river. This isn't about her.\n\nNo one made OP's sister agree to this. She could've been like \"I understand what you're getting at, but I've made my decision and my decision is final.\"\n\nOP's sister was only overruled because she allowed herself to be overruled.. I'm sorry, but that's not OP's fault. NTA.", "So bummed that I had to scroll so far down to find a NTA... Mom is salty that the bride didn't take her side. It has nothing to do with the cost factor. Mom could have said no we don't have the budget for it and that would have been fine.", "I'm with you on this one. Yes overruling bla bla bla and all that. \n\nTo me, OP and wife decide a theme, and it's their wedding so obviously they can do whatever they want. I'll think OP didn't have any intention of messing up with her sister with what he mention to his nephew. \n\nCould this be managed in a better way? Yeah sure. OP could mention that is ok to wear whatever he want but that's something he should talk with his mom. And also the mom should take into account that the weeding of HER brother and the theme is clearly not the conventional one, so it's the worse scenario to \"teach proper weeding etiquette\".\n\nAlso, this is just me talking about myself, but the whole \"will reflect on me\" and annoy me. If I have a kid and he have the choice to wear whatever he want at a party or event without having an issue with the dress code like in this example, I couldn't care less if anyone think anything about it as long as the kid is happy and we all have a good time. I'm the same, I don't care about what other people can think of me as long as I'm happy and I see no reason why I would do the opposite with a kid, specially a 13 year old kid.", "THIS. Plus, the kid is 13, and he\u2019s one of 6. How much of a chance do you think he gets to stand out and express himself? The fact that Mom said she\u2019s worried about how his outfit will reflect on her tells me it\u2019s not a matter of cost or practicality, but image. It\u2019s image for him, too, and I think that\u2019s why he recruited OP for help. I don\u2019t understand this obsession some parents have with making their kids into perfect little dolls. They\u2019re individuals and at that age especially they\u2019re learning who they are and how to share that with the world. (And before you ask I have a 13-year-old.)", "I feel like once a decision of who\u2019s the ah is determined by top comment, everyone follows suit and just echos the same point, but I actually agree with this comment. NTA at all!!\n\nIf it was about expenses, OP sister should just say that\u2026but this was about how the outfit would reflect on the sister, not about money. As a kid, my mom always had jurisdiction on my hair and clothes because she paid for it. Even when I made my own money, she always tried to police what I wore. It wasn\u2019t until I got older and more experimental (which is really trying blonde streaks or red once in a while with wigs/extensions) \n\nI don\u2019t even think the kid was trying to overrule his mom, I think he was trying to insiste it followed theme. Kids don\u2019t have the foresight to think about clothes wear for the future. And as everyone else mentioned, he will most likely grow out of the clothes anyway. He was wanting to wear an outfit that made him happy like his aunt said! I do think a comment above had a good compromise. The tie and the cuff links would be a great compromise to a new basic suit. But I think this was made into a huge deal for a kid trying to follow the rules", "Finally someone with sense!

She said specifically she wanted creativity, her nephew came up with something creative that appealed to him. OP's sister needs to pull back a little. NTA!", "I totally agree with you. If the main issue was the mother thinking it's not appropriate, then  it's only normal that the kid went to ask OP about it. The bride is the one deciding what's appropriate or not. Period. And she said she would be okay with that, she didn't force her sister to buy it. \nYou wouldn't wear white tie to a beach wedding so why make the kid wear a formal suit to a more \"laid back\" (informal?) Wedding? I also say NTA", "Totally agreed. If it\u2019s money, as you say in 2, then mom can say that she\u2019s not buying that outfit because of money reasons, not because it\u2019s inappropriate for the event (because the people holding the event have explicitly stated otherwise). Bride shouldn\u2019t be expected to lie to someone else\u2019s child, so NTA.\n\nEdit to add: props to the kid too for taking the initiative to seek out the right answer for himself", "Yup, NTA.", "This whole trend in these comments blaming the sister for telling the kid the truth is so wild to me. My brothers don\u2019t have to lie to my kids about stuff for me. If I say no it still means no. Why should sis have to lie if mom was dishonest. It\u2019s appropriate for the wedding. Period. If mom still doesn\u2019t wanna buy it that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t use her sister to lie for her.", "Agreed. At a minimum, OP needed to check in with the sister to see if there was a why attached that didn\u2019t have anything to do with OP\u2019s wedding.", "Exactly. I don't understand what all the NTA people don't get about this. So many discussions on \"toxic behavior\" here, yet they encourage her to undermine her sister, rather than offering to speak to the sister about the outfit. It's so basic.", "This is my thought.\n\nThe NFL jacket is probably poor quality and overpriced. I can understand not wanting to drop a bunch of money on something like that. The cuff links and tie is potentially doable and a good compromise. She could have helped mediate to that compromise with the kid and make everyone somewhat happy.", "This, exactly. If the issue was price it'd be one thing, but the issue according to mom was the outfit would reflect poorly on her. OP told her nephew his outfit wouldn't reflect poorly and would actually be welcomed. Thats not undermining any parenting.

My then 7 year old immediately said yes but over the next few weeks they worried about protecting the precious golden treasures. I told the bride and she came over with a toy sword and presented it to my little one. They became a fierce guardian and carried the rings and the sword down the isle. It was the best wedding ever.

Then I would be fine with it.", "For the record, this kind of response really pushes you further \\*into\\* TA territory. It's their money, not yours, so they're the ones who get to decide what things are financial issues for themselves. A suit jacket that won't be appropriate for most other occasions, especially given that they have six kids, might be a bigger deal to them than you realize. I can afford a $60 jacket, no problem, but do I want to buy one for a kid who won't ever wear it again? Not really.", "Erm. Didn't you say they have 6 kids?", "But he has a little brother who could wear it in the future.", "I totally agree with this as someone who has kids; sometimes they have huge growth spurts, sometimes they don\u2019t. The bigger issue is the price thing. If it\u2019s more expensive than a regular blazer, and only really able to be worn one time, that would be an issue for me too as a mom. I let my kids pretty much dress in what they like, but they understand there are some small rules for what\u2019s school or event appropriate \u2014 for example, wearing weather appropriate clothes so they\u2019re not too hot or cold, or not wearing an expensive new dress to school where it might get dirty/torn etc. The point is I think it\u2019s unfair of OP to be like \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d when she had the opportunity to explore why the parents said no and then discuss from there.", "Maybe yes, maybe no. But, suits tend to last for awhile and he has a younger brother and 2 younger sisters who might grow into and want to wear it eventually, too. But, they may not share his love for that team or want to wear their jacket - even assuming that there might be another \u201cartsy\u201d party they\u2019re invited to where it would be appropriate. And, before I get downvoted for including his younger sisters, we don\u2019t know anything about them. And, back when I could still fit into them, I, as a 25-30+ something married woman, used to buy some of my suits in the boys department. They\u2019re a heck of a lot cheaper and, as long as I wore the jacket unbuttoned - which a woman can do - absolutely no one noticed the lack of darts (and I do have noticeable boobs), which I could have added at a tailor shop and still spent less than I would have buying a suit in the adult department. The tie and cuff links are enough to add a personal touch without the jacket. Subtlety is an art and learning how to deploy it is a lesson well worth learning. Of course, if he is spending his own money on the jacket, maybe let him go for it. But, only if he understands that he\u2019s spending his money on the equivalent of a wedding/prom dress.

Any other tips, O sympathetic one?", "And you\u2019re rude af!", "I\u2019m actually an adult. I wore the dresses to church and shit and I hated it. I like body mods and tattoos and unatural hair colors and now that I\u2019m an adult that\u2019s allowed to express myself I do. Many events that require dress attire don\u2019t like the way I look anyway. I\u2019m not gonna sacrifice who I am to please social norms because they\u2019re bullshit and in different places they\u2019re different! Novel concept I know but you should be less of a sheep and you might just be happier with your life \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That\u2019s also not what was expressed here though so that\u2019s moot.", "She may not have wanted her families financial business to be common knowledge.", "Yeah, in my family, the mom would be lucky if he had the occasion to wear it a second time.", "Where did I say that? I don\u2019t think a bride who knows her niece has blue hair is going to demand she dye it brown for her semi formal wedding. \n\nI will say though, now, there are certain schools (private schools) that don\u2019t allow kids to have unnatural hair colours. So if it\u2019s so important for your kid to have teal hair don\u2019t send them there. \n\nI\u2019m not saying there can\u2019t be rules that are unnecessarily restrictive or prohibitive but you have the choice to not attend those events/schools/etc rather than break dress codes.", "Definitely not all the time. Certain guidelines are fair but yeah anything else is too suffocating.", "I feel pretty sure we had dollar stores in the 80s. We called them two dollar shops. Might have been late 80s... Regardless. Spray paint was a thing", "That was a lot of words to try and make OP responsible for her sisters parenting. She didn\u2019t have to lie to her nephew. Period. If sis wanted someone to lie to the kid she now knows sis won\u2019t be the one. Sis needs to get her house in order cause now the wedding that\u2019s nothing to do with her is taking alot of time talking about her. Sis can and should learn to parent her children.", "Yes I have two children and 8 nibblings between my four brothers. Your your right you can answer a question with a question. There\u2019s no reason to, you can just tell the truth, but I\u2019m not a dishonest asshole so I don\u2019t do that to kids. My kids get full honest answers. That\u2019s why they respect me and don\u2019t try and undercut me with others. Again we circle back to this being a parenting problem.", "He wasn't asking for permission, though, he asked if it was appropriate according to the rules of the wedding.", "She didn't overrule her older sister, but she did \\*undermine\\* her. She knew her sister had said no. She knew that older sister had already explained reasons why. She knowingly undermined what her sister had said and told nephew \"we would love to see him in it if that\u2019s what made him happy,\" which sets her sister up for being the HUGE bad guy if she continues to say \"no.\"", "You're not wrong, but at 13 how many times is he going to wear it before he outgrows it? If he's in a dress shirt, smart trousers and a real tie he's doing about as well as you can expect from a kid. If they bought him a suit he'd be taking the jacket off as soon as possible anyway.", "This! All these \"parents paying for it\" are cringe AF that's a parents job to pay for things for the child they decided to bring into this world duh! Parents are also supposed to foster their children's growth and individuality. There are ways to compromise and handle it without the whole \"my house my rules\" aspect. The child didn't ask to be brought into the \"your house your rules\"  that was forced upon them.\n\nI don't find what OP did as AH, more of she approves vs saying your mom should get it bc I approve. Just handled all wrong", "But OP didn't offer to pay. OP put the mom in a tough spot so she would have to buy it.", "Why is this getting downvoted? This is a good point. Did you guys forget how it was when you were kids? At that age, a piece of clothing lasted me like half a year, especially something as fitted as a dress shirt and a two piece suit.", "She absolutely has the right to say if an outfit is suitable or not.\n\nShe doesn't get to then countermand the child's parent who has already said no to an outfit.\n\nOP could have let Mom know that OP wouldn't have an issue with the outfit at the wedding.   That would have been fine.", "Sure, she can decide a dress code.  And good on her for saying 'that outfit meets my dress code.'\n\nShe still doesn't get to override Mom's choice about that outfit.", "Seriously, what is with the comments saying he can't wear it for another occasion? Like even if there is another wedding in a year, he likely won't be able to fit this outfit anyway", "A normal dress suit and pants (expensive, if my recent need to buy dressy clothing are any indication). Blazers for teams are also on the upper end of expensive unless it's a knockoff in which case it likely won't look formal.", "It matters because the kid isn\u2019t paying for it himself. \n\nEveryone is acting like he\u2019s an autonomous adult who is being gravely wronged, but he is a literal child whose mother told him that he can\u2019t wear an NFL blazer to a *wedding*. It\u2019s irrelevant if the bride approved it because the bride is not his mother.  And tbh, it\u2019s irrelevant *why* mom said no. Mom said no. That\u2019s the end.   (/\u00af \u0ca0_\u0ca0)/\u00af", "I love you.", "> Where did I say that? I don\u2019t think a bride who knows her niece has blue hair is going to demand she dye it brown for her semi formal wedding.\n\nAnd yet, that is a very common post in this sub.", "Yeah all those words? Nome of those are a lie. It's called not falling for the trap amd being a good aunt and sister.", "Yea. And there in lies the manipulation you would obviously fall for because now he will go back to mon and say \"but aunt said it was fine!!!\" Despite knowing the kon already told him no. And the aunt went ahead and doubled down by the lunch with the mom and the kid to fall further into the manipulation trap of making kon the bad guy for saying no.", "So OP should have lied to her nephew so her sister could save face. Wouldn't the nephew have a problem with OP after he saw what others were wearing. I don't get it, the sister is the bad guy, just own it. I never had a problem with telling my son no, this seems weird. Maybe this is new parenting, lol.", "Depending on the area quite a bit. Most 13 years olds I grew up with needed formal wear for bar/bat mitzvahs, confirmation parties, 7/8th grade formals, and middle school graduation.", "It really depends \u2014 does his family have multiple weddings coming up? How much has he already grown? Obviously very unusual, but my husband can still wear the suit he got for his bar mitzvah; it\u2019s not a perfect fit, but if you\u2019re not looking closely you wouldn\u2019t notice. \n\nRegardless, I think the key is that *if* his mother is worried about spending money on something he won\u2019t wear again, she needs to frame it that way, rather than trying to pin blame on someone else by claiming they would object.", "Counter point the mom can still say no and not get it.", "Or she could be a parent and just say no.\n\nDo you know how many times I've had to say no when my ex, my child's literal other parent, allowed our child to do something that's not good and we do not do in our house?\n\nShe can just point out the reasons why she won't put her money to it. \n\nSometimes you're the bad guy being a parent. You don't have to like it, I sure don't, but you have to get over that and do it.", "Nope.  You read your own circumstance(?) into that, i think..", "Mum said no because she said the outfit wasn't appropriate for a wedding. Bride contradicted her, and said that it was suitable for this particular wedding. On that front, bride has final say. If mum has issues for other reasons, she should have just been honest with both her son and OP about why she didn't want him to wear it.", "The kid asked OP, she said it was fine, *then* kid's mom got all bent out of shape because, somehow, OP was supposed to psychically know that her sister wanted her to lie and say she had a problem with the outfit.\n\nSister is the AH who thinks her parenting powers extend to deciding the dress code at someone else's wedding.", "Mom doesn't get to override what she wants at her wedding. Sister should probably just not come, she's too uptight and she's going to ruin the fun for everyone else. I'd also recommend you don't attend weddings for anyone who isn't as tediously banal as yourself.", "Or that he should be forced to wear \u201cappropriate clothing\u201d in the future. \n\nThey sound like people who think they should be able to dictate what acceptable hair colors/cuts for other people are. \n\nWhat the kid chooses to wear doesn\u2019t reflect on his mom at all. It reflects on him. It\u2019s pretty gross that she is treating her teenage son as an accessory.", "I know right?\n\nYou're buying a formal suit for a 13 yo boy, you've accepted the likely odds it'll only be worn once.", "It\u2019s formal enough for the event holders to OK", "I agree with you though! What the kid wants is basically irrelevant cuz he's a freaking kid. This is really between OP and her sister. OP says something is okay for her wedding. Sister didn't want it but got it anyway because why? Wanting her kid to look nice doesn't make her a bad mom, but blaming someone for something she had total control over might make her a sucky sister.", "*It's not mom's wedding.* She doesn't get to decide how *other people* want guests dressed at *their* wedding.", "Yeah and honestly most of the posts probably aren\u2019t real. Most people don\u2019t behave like that in real life.", "No, she shouldn\u2019t have lied, but you know there\u2019s a middle ground between lying and undermining his mother right?? Like, those weren\u2019t the only two options.\n\n\u201cLook, how about you let me have a think on it and I\u2019ll see where we land?\u201d\n\nOr\n\n\u201cYou know what, your mother has made a decision so, at this point, it\u2019s not really important what I think.\u201d", "\"What did your parents say?\" isn't a lie, it's respecting and backing up your sibling with their parenting. Nephew's annoyance/ire would have continued to be directed at his parents, regardless. \n\nI've never had a problem backing my sister up with her parenting decisions so-as not to create unnecessary strife and friction, but I guess maybe \"throw your sibling under the bus and undermine their parenting decisions\" is how it's done, now? \\*That\\* seems weird to me. Asking \"what did your mom say\" is a totally normal part of my vocabulary with my nieces .", "\u201cWhat did your parents say?\u201d Is essential for aunts and uncles .I\u2019m surprised OP made it this far without knowing this\n\nYTA", "And it's not like the teen wouldn't realize mom was the actual culprit when he shows up at the wedding and other guest are wearing their most flamboyant, over the top outfit.", "And how will that look? The Mum will be the bad guy even more so. This is why undermining parenting is dangerous. The nephew is hardly going to care about the financial implications or anything else. They'll just see their Mum as the bad guy who is going against him and OP. But until OP offers to pay, she has no say so in the matter.", "Wrong.  The submission clearly says that the kid told OP mom said no, and that OP then told him to wear it anyway.\n\n>  He told us his mom said no and then asked my opinion on it, I showed it to my fiance and we both agreed it was acceptable and we would love to see him in it if that\u2019s what made him happy.\n\nIt should have gone 'he told us mom said no, and we said we really liked the outfit, but he'd need to talk to his mom about it.  We told him he could let mom know that we said that outfit would fit into our dress code, but of course, it's her decision.'", " I certainly wouldn't attend a wedding where the bride and groom felt they had approval powers over people's outfits beyond a standard dress code.", "Which reads to me that it's more expensive, and therefore likely *too* expensive to justify if there are other events that would likely need him to have a suit in the future."]}
