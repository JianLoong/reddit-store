The faucet they purchased had the wrong connecters to coneect to the existing copper piping so I wasn't able to install it right away.

It was a rant about how I shouldn't promise to do things for her elderly parents, if I wasn't going to. And that I wasn't hurting her by hurting them. Obviously, that meant they were telling their daughter that I'd been helping them. The main reason for the agreement was to facilitate cutting ties with their daughter. I didn't want to be accused of trying to stay in her life or trying to keep tabs on her. I was helping her parents because they're good people that need the help.\n\nAs a result of whatever they were telling her about me, not only did that give her an excuse to blast about me on social media, but also, she managed to skew it into a belief that I wasn't helping her parents as a way to get back at her.\n\nSo, to me, I did the only logical thing: I went over to her parents house and reminded them of our agreement. Of how they weren't supposed to mention anything about me to their daughter and that, because of this betrayal, I will no longer be available to help them with anything around the house.\n\nI was polite & cordial about it.

You are an extremely kind and generous person to be going and helping out an ex\u2019s parents, and you don\u2019t ask for payment. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH to want to take a step back at the moment.\n\nIf there was genuinely no malice on the part of the parents and it was the first slip-up, I would probably help them again (after a firm discussion with a warning it won\u2019t happen again) - but to be clear, I don\u2019t think you are obliged to regardless, if you don\u2019t want to. If they were gossiping or bitching about you, understandable you\u2019d want to stay away from that mess, since it is an ex-family after all.\n\nYou\u2019re bloody decent anyway for what you have been doing for them.", "NTA...   they took advantage and are still trying to take advantage by using terms like one of the few people they trust... thats emotional manipulation.

But if you feel like you should go back and help out, you'll just need to accept that they might talk about you to her.

This is not the case here.", "I know your ex\u2019s parents completely violated your boundaries.

I could totally see my mother or my grandmother just telling me the full story of the process of a long repair just because it is one of the few things she has going on in her life. \n\nIt really sounds like your ex is the one with ill intent. Not them. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for advice. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. You sound like a great guy who has done more than enough for them.

Always reattached the old faucet before he left.", "I couldn\u2019t figure out how to say this, but this is perfect \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "I did not say that OP owed them. He even stated that the husband offered to pay him several times and he turned them down. So I don\u2019t think this is a matter of them trying to take advantage of him. \n\nI think, they trusted OP. Most older people fear being taken advantage of. And OP sort of prolonged the process and could\u2019ve caused more damage or the prices to go up mid-project.", "I agree with all that you have said, and another conversation with them is a possibility. Being elderly it is hard to find someone you trust to come in your house and fix things. The first time I went over there I fixed their leaky sink with a .50 cent washer, then their old handy man told them it would cost $200 and he had to replace the entire thing. I do want to add a little clarity to something you said. This particular task was just to replace an existing faucet with a new one. Each time I was unable to install the replacement, I reattached the old one, and at no point left them without a fully functional sink."]}
