Obviously, that meant they were telling their daughter that I'd been helping them. The main reason for the agreement was to facilitate cutting ties with their daughter.

Actions have consequences.", "NTA. Not only did they betray your trust/boundary, but they were clearly also complaining about you to their daughter. Way to bite the hand that feeds you. You are not responsible for them. You were doing an incredibly generous thing and they didn\u2019t appreciate it. Buh-bye", "NTA. You did this to get away from her. They'll have to pay someone else to do the work you did for free. It's not your job.", "NTA: You went way the hell above and beyond by helping the parents of an ex.  The only requirement was \"don't talk about me to her.\"  They broke that simple requirement.\n\nFuck around and find out, bite the hand that feeds, reap what you sow, however you say it.  Your job is done mate.", "They fucked around, they found out.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were being kind with only two boundaries, and they crossed it.

And I guess in their eyes, blood is thicker than water. Prioritize yourself, and they can have her help them out.", "NTA.  I would have done the same thing.  If you\u2019re still feeling bad about it do a small amount of research to find a reliable handyman in the area and provide them with the contact info.  This relieves any guilt in your part and provides them an option / plan when they need help.  I help my elderly parents and understand how a little thing like this can overwhelm when you\u2019re elderly.  You\u2019re a very nice person btw.  All good things to you.", "NTA.

Your ex is clearly toxic and a cheater. You have every right after her hurtful blast to take your leave from the family.
