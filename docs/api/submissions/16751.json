Handyman stuff. Her parents were always very nice to me and I continued to help them after she bounced. I made an agreement with her parents that I would never ask anything about her, nor that I be told about anything going on in her life. I also didn't want them to tell her about anything going on in my life or that I was continuing to help them with things.\n\n2 years have gone by and I've fixed leaky sinks, taken care of various things around the house and, when it snows, I'm always there to shovel. (Corner hose. 'Nuff said.)\n\nA few months ago, I agreed to install a new faucet on 1 of their sinks. The faucet they purchased had the wrong connecters to coneect to the existing copper piping so I wasn't able to install it right away. The 1st time I came back, I'd purchased adapters to mount it and the adapters had the wrong threading. After another week or so, I came back with more adapters only to find out that they were straight thread and not pipe thread. So they leaked at the joint.\n\nUnable to get the proper adapters, I'd gotten a little frustrated. Then some personal matters came up and I put the sink on the backburner. (Just to be clear: Every time I failed an attempt to mount the new faucet, I would remount the original. So I never left them without a functioning sink.)\n\nThe other day, a friend let me know that there was a post directed to me on 1 of her socials. It was a rant about how I shouldn't promise to do things for her elderly parents, if I wasn't going to. And that I wasn't hurting her by hurting them. Obviously, that meant they were telling their daughter that I'd been helping them. The main reason for the agreement was to facilitate cutting ties with their daughter. I didn't want to be accused of trying to stay in her life or trying to keep tabs on her. I was helping her parents because they're good people that need the help.\n\nAs a result of whatever they were telling her about me, not only did that give her an excuse to blast about me on social media, but also, she managed to skew it into a belief that I wasn't helping her parents as a way to get back at her.\n\nSo, to me, I did the only logical thing: I went over to her parents house and reminded them of our agreement. Of how they weren't supposed to mention anything about me to their daughter and that, because of this betrayal, I will no longer be available to help them with anything around the house.\n\nI was polite & cordial about it. But still have a bad taste in my mouth. After I had left, her mother sent me a series of text messages, apologizing.

Your job is done mate.", "They fucked around, they found out.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were being kind with only two boundaries, and they crossed it.

And I guess in their eyes, blood is thicker than water. Prioritize yourself, and they can have her help them out.", "NTA.  I would have done the same thing.  If you\u2019re still feeling bad about it do a small amount of research to find a reliable handyman in the area and provide them with the contact info.  This relieves any guilt in your part and provides them an option / plan when they need help.  I help my elderly parents and understand how a little thing like this can overwhelm when you\u2019re elderly.  You\u2019re a very nice person btw.  All good things to you.", "NTA.

But I think it\u2019s best to cut ties, honestly, something you should\u2019ve done from the beginning of the break up. I just think it\u2019s time to close that chapter of your life and move on. It is your decision, this is just my opinion on the matter. GoodLuck", "NTA. You had one simple agreement that they accepted to keep, and they couldn\u2019t even hold their end of the agreement.

I don't think you have to, but you could.", "Info: May I ask if you communicated with her parents about when you\u2019ll be back to fix it? \n\nI wonder if they may not have intentionally told her to spite you but were more so a bit inconvenienced or just making conversation and it slipped out because of how long the process has been taking.", "Brilliant response that outlines how they really lost out on a great deal", "I think they also might have lost out on it by being ungrateful.  There had to be at least some negativity around the sink issue that they shared with their daughter to give her the impetus  for her post.", "Yeah, like I\u2019m imagining some nice elderly folk telling their daughter about their new faucet and slipping that OP had to come back to fix it or how hard finding the right part was. Maybe not even bitching, just making old people conversation\u2026 But they have a crazy bananas daughter who can\u2019t pass up an opportunity to cause drama regardless of who it hurts. \n\nIt just seems like the perfect way for the ex to cause a rift with the son in law they seem to like better than her. It\u2019s actually kind of beautiful when your in laws stay family after the law part goes away. My MIL was by her (former) MIL\u2019s\nside when she died. They were friends. If OP wants that, I think it\u2019s fair to give the ex-in-laws a second chance. I\u2019m fairly sure they\u2019ve been scared straight. And if they have never made a flub before or treated you as anything less than a family member in your own right, give them the same grace you would give someone who didn\u2019t share DNA with you evil ex."]}
