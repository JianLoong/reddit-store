Obviously, that meant they were telling their daughter that I'd been helping them. The main reason for the agreement was to facilitate cutting ties with their daughter.

Have I screwed up and mentioned something I shouldn't have at the wrong moment?  You bet I have.... sometimes things just slip out in conversation without consciously meaning to.  You gotta decide.  I don't think anybody sane would believe you are doing it to keep \"tabs\" on your ex, but I know some women can imagine all sorts of things.

Only fools bites the hands that helps them. \n\nAnd the vise walks away from betrayal before it becomes a backstab.", "NTA, you don't owe them anything and you're a good man. The question here is can you live with yourself now or if the gnawing feeling of walking away is too strong? If you can live with it then live with it, if you feel bad go back and continue your arrangement.", "NTA. You are a nice person and they betrayed you.", "NTA. You had an agreenent - they broke it - your agreement is no longer. They thought you would help them no matter what, I guess, that's why they told everything to the daughter without thinking much of it. It seems they got used to you helping them and didn't see that much value in it, otherwise they woudn't break the agreement so easily.", "100% this. Sounds like a family of takers. You can walk away with your head held high. They can pay for people to do jobs from now onwards. Not your monkeys, not your circus.", "NTA. \n\nThe truth is, OP, you should have walked away long before this, good people or not. \n\nLoose threads are often what people hang themselves with. \n\nLet go of them, live your life.", "Exactly.  Why is the ex blasting him on social media when it is HER responsibility to look after her parents and make sure it's okay? Why doesn't she PAY for a plumber to fix the issue instead of broadcasting it on social media. \n\nI feel sorry for her parents but it's their own fault.", "Yes. Although I wonder, did the parents run to the ex to complain that OP wasn't fixing their faucet, or did the ex notice that the faucet was dodgy, and then push the parents to tell her what was going on. She sounds like she may have a bit of \"main character syndrome\", so maybe the parents were dragged into it unwillingly.", "Exactly!\n\nI was expecting these parents and OP share a unique blood type and if he doesn't donate anymore, they'll die. Or maybe they all live on one of those isolated islands off Greenland, where there's only 7 people and a million seagulls so every resident is dependent on the others?\n\nBut no, it's random handyman stuff. \nAs if I enjoy calling up strangers and have them root around in my storage/dirty laundry cupboard in order to repair my washing machine?! \n\n\"We only trust you in our home\" is tough luck! They definitely took advantage.\n\nETA NTA", "This. NTA", "Best response. \nNTA Op\n\nNothing more to be said. I get they\u2019re old - but their own daughter can find someone they can trust to assist. \n\nThis truly isn\u2019t your issue and you\u2019re not the one abandoning them.", "To be fair I can imagine it's difficult to not at any point mention OP is helping them around the house. Ex might have spun it into something incredibly negative when the parents just stated in a neutral way OP helped and wasn't able to fix the sink yet. It's elderly people who have kept the promise for 2 years. It might not be nefarious at all. Hell, maybe the ex pushed them to tell them. \n\nNTA though, but I think it's a shame to burn all bridges.", "ESH is probably the judgment you're looking for where everyone did something wrong.", "Yea I kinda agree with your take, I am older and I have said things I shouldn\u2019t have, it happens. I was getting a nice warm cozy feeling reading it, sounded like some nice folks made a friendship with a really decent person. Imo I think at worst the parents let it slip and the daughter was more than ready to play the victim for them. Maybe set down and chat, good friendships are hard to come by so don\u2019t waste one on a misunderstanding", "Look, NTA, but this wasn't a realistic arrangement in the first place. If you want tomcut ties with someone, you don't stay involved with their parents, and expecting someone to keep secrets from their child is just a recipe for more drama down the road. I think you meant well, you didn't want to abandon two elderly people, but it would have been better to let them hire someone for this stuff and only help in real emergencies. And I don't think they intentionally \"betrayed\" you, it was a given that they would slip at some point and tell their daughter about it. The only asshole I can see is your ex.", "I agree with Frank\\_Jesus", "Lots of old people are good. Lots of them are bad. People don't as a rule get nicer with age.\n\nAnd if we take an optimist's view of the human race, and that as a species we are improving, it logically follows that on average young people will be nicer than older people.", "Exactly. If they don't like the way he's been doing things - unpaid, on his own time - they can find someone else and stop trashing him. It's probably not just the ex they've been complaining to as well.\n\nBesides, I'm sure handymen are meant to have insurance for a good reason. If he fixes something and anything goes wrong, isn't he liable?  They can find someone else.", "I agree scummy repair men are scummy, but at the same time, everyone has to navigate that. \n\nMy father only ever learnt how to hold the flashlight from his father, so I learnt nothing at all about handyman repairs. I've been scammed by people overcharging too. I'm close enough (emotionally and physically) to ask my brother for help if I really have to, but he has his own life.\nIt's not feasible to have you come do my repairs either, right?"]}
