{"id": 31023, "submission_id": "17vuywr", "title": "AITA for refusing to help my paternal grandparents with their grandchild?", "selftext": "I (19M) have not had my dad in my life since I was 6. He was a pretty absent dad when he and my mom were married but then she found out he had been cheating on her and she divorced him. The person he was having the affair with knew about us and she had been led to believe that she was going to get a kid out of the deal, believing she was infertile. So my dad made mom an offer that he would take me off her hands for his other woman to raise and he would give her some money every month. I learned most of this in the last couple of years. My mom always kept this stuff to herself before that. She never wanted to burden me or for me to feel more hate for him than I already did for not being in my life. But she was honest with me eventually and I'm kinda glad she didn't tell me when I was small. I really had a lot of hate in me for a few years and it would have made things worse.\n\nMy dad's parents were in my life even after he wasn't. They did have some communication with him but not all that much. He married the other woman and apparently they had tried to adopt and stuff but failed at several hurdles. Then she got pregnant a few years ago and they had a daughter. My dad ended up dying just after the baby was born. He had a massive heart attack which didn't surprise me or my mom at all. He worked a lot back when he was with my mom and his diet was shit.\n\nFour months ago his wife died in a car crash which left their daughter without either parent. So my grandparents became her legal guardians.\n\nI have never met her and even though she is my half sister biologically, I do not consider her my sibling or my family. For me blood isn't what really makes a family and I don't want to be part of her family circle.\n\nMy grandparents have asked me for help with her. They have said they are not getting any younger and would like someone who would maybe come and play with her for a while and they suggested that I could babysit if they have medical appointments and don't want to have her running around hospitals, etc. I told them I did not want to be in her life and I did not want to meet her so I would not help them with her. I suggested they find a babysitter who can help. They told me it would be better for her if I did it because she could get to know me and having a big brother in her life would be a lot better for her. I made it clear to them that I was not interested. But they didn't like that and they told me they have always done their best to make up for how badly my dad treated me and they want me to be better than him and to make sure she has better than I did. They told me she is innocent and they never did anything wrong in this either, so why punish everyone else.\n\nWhen I didn't give in they told me I was turning into my dad aka someone who doesn't care about people I should care about. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700058981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vuywr/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_paternal/", "score": 1642, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're drawing a clear boundary and, considering what your father was like, your grandparents should respect it. The fact that your grandparents are at an advanced age also means they're likely trying to forge a relationship between you so that, if anything does happen to them, you (or even your mom) would step in and take guardianship of your half-sister.\n\nI know that some folks are saying Y T A because you're not helping grandparents that have been there for you and that you're taking this out on a kid, but you are not responsible for this  little girl. Furthermore, it's probably better this way for you AND her. You sound completely disinterested in having a relationship with her; even occasional babysitting might give your grandparents chances to convince this little girl that you are a devoted older brother when those feelings aren't actually there.", "Nta but here is the thing. Tread lightly. Your grandparents understand they are old. Your grandparents understand they may die in the next 14/15 years. They want you to build a relationship with her\u2026so you will take legal guardianship of her if they become unable or they pass. As a parent I can tell you exactly what they are doing. You\u2019re a legal adult. They are looking for a potential parent\u2026not someone to babysit her once or twice a month.", "NTA. Just because she's innocent, doesn't make her your responsibility. It's not her fault her dad was trash, just like it's not yours. But it's not your responsibility to take care of his responsibility, just because he's gone. Trying to guilt or shame you by comparing you refusing to help with your father abandoning you isn't fair at all.\n\nBut this is going to ruin your relationship with your grandparents. They've made their position clear: they think that you owe this girl, they think you owe them, and they are making your relationship with them dependant on your relationship with your \"sibling\". They want what they think is best for both of you, and they think that means fostering a relationship between the two of you so she has someone to rely on when they are gone. There is no argument you can make with them that will overcome their desire to see their granddaughter safe in the future. There are no winners here, you just have to decide how much you are willing to lose.", "No I'm not my dad because she isn't my daughter", ">They told me it would be better for her if I did it because she could get to know me and having a big brother in her life would be a lot better for her.

They told me she is innocent and they never did anything wrong in this either, so why punish everyone else.\n\nMy heart breaks for this little girl, but they are trying to force a sibling relationship on you that you are clearly not interested in. \n\nSurely, if you reluctantly visited a few times, she got used to the presence of her ' big brother ' , but then you decided to move away, then what? This already traumatised child would feel hurt all over again. And surely that's worse. \n\nWhere is her maternal family? \n\nNTA", "NTA, although they weren\u2019t AHs until they started guilt-tripping you and insinuating you were anything like your dad. Your dad abandoned people he chose to have in his life. He abandoned a child he chose to father. You refuse to get to know someone who just happens to share some DNA. That\u2019s far from being the same thing, even if they are right about the kid being innocent.", "NTA not wanting to be dumped with your dad\u2019s kid from his affair partner does not make you like him. They are totally wrong to say that. Truth is if you start to take care of her they will most likely end up suggesting you take her full time as they are too old so best to nip that in the butt now", "NTA. It is true that your half sister is innocent, but she is not your responsibility, and if you don't want a relationship with her, that is certainly your prerogative.", "Nta, they should be looking into other options for who will raise the child. That's what they are looking for, not a babysitter or helper. And you are not a good candidate, not only are you still young in life, you harbor negative feelings for its father (and maybe it's mother too), and that would cause far worse trauma for you and it if the child went to you. Don't do it, get your boundry across in writing just in case! Text, email, anything that you can trace.", "NTA. \n\nMy best friend was raised by her grandma. She became a full time caretaker when she should have been a carefree teen or going to college. Grandma died when we were 21 and it totally destabilized her. We're 35 now and she is still on the poverty line, developed massive depression and anxiety, and is living in a group house for low rent with too many others crammed in. It is not easy to survive without parents until you're actually stable (living in Canada is insanely expensive). \n\nAre there any couples (even distant relatives?) who would be willing to do an open adoption? Your grandparents might need to accept there is no suitable parent amongst you and that the child deserves to be raised by willing parents who'll be there for the long run. \n\nI'm sure your grandparents probably weren't expecting their retirement to be taken up by parenting again either. \n\nThey should make a decision on what's best for the kid's entire life. And if she's under another roof, you'd be able to develop a relationship over time, with no strings attached and on your own terms. Good luck.\n\n\nEdit: grammar.", "NtA- you understandably have a lot of trauma surrounding your father and his, quite frankly shitty choices as a husband and father. I know exactly how it feels and the betrayal cuts deep. \n\nYou have been clear with your grandparents and established valid boundaries with valid explanations. They chose to take in their grandchild, knowing that they aren\u2019t getting any younger. I\u2019m guessing their plan was to slowly get you to be more involved with the child so you would eventually step up and take over parenting the child. \n\nMoving forward, you need to keep reinforcing your boundaries. You will get judgment from family members who have suddenly become involved in the situation- when they start to judge you, ask them if they can step in. I\u2019m sure that will shut them up! \nYou also have to prepare yourself to lose your relationship with your grandparents. As they will try to keep emotionally blackmailing you to have a relationship with this kid.", "NTA. Your grandparents is setting you up. They already know they can\u2019t watch that child long term so they want you to build a relationship with her and then spring on that you should take her in.", "NTA\n\nThey should have thought of a better plan to care for her than to rely entirely on someone that has never wanted anything to do with her. They set themselves up for failure. You are not like your father because he abandoned his child while you are just saying no to a job(probably unpaid). Not your child (or even family member), not your responsibility. But you are going to damage your relationship with your grandparents.", "NTA.  This is a terrible situation.  Does her mother not have any extended family?", "NTA. While they are right that their granddaughter is innocent and is not to blame for what your dad did, she is absolutely not your responsibility.  They need to make other arrangements.", "Your grandparents, being the good people they are, will need to make arrangements for the care of your half sister should they die before she becomes an adult.  You can be a part of this solution or not.  Obviously your choice.  Don\u2019t be surprised if the bulk of their estate goes to her and her care.", "NTA. Your stated wishes in this are clear. This is not a relationship you wish to foster. I understand your grandparents, but that they chose to foster a relationship with you when their son fumbled the bag should not be used to manipulate you into a caring for someone you never wanted to interact with.", "NTA. \n\nYes their granddaughter is innocent in this situation, but that doesn't make her your responsibility. You are just as innocent as she is. \n\nYou are not like your father because that is not your daughter.\n\nIs there no one on the granddaughters moms side of the family that can help? Where are her maternal grandparents/family?", "NTA, if you don\u2019t want a relationship with your half-sister, that\u2019s your choice, and no one can make you do something you don\u2019t want to do at your age. But I just can\u2019t believe that your Dad tried to get your Mum to sell you to his mistress!! That\u2019s f*cked up!!", "NTA. Relationships are not forced.", "Don\u2019t let yourself be guilt tripped.. it\u2019s not a healthy thing for you to be jumping in and out of her life as a babysitter, because she could get attached and hurt along the way. The only time you should be in contact with her is when you yourself decide it. Unfortunately your dad made the bed, his daughter has to lie in it. NTA", "I would vote NTA.\n\nYour grandparents probably do need a certain level of help and support with this unexpected child being thrown into their lives. They should not, however, be laying a big guilt-trip on you for refusing to be part of the support group and telling you that you are turning into (presumably the worst part) of your father.\n\nI understand you don't want to be seen as family. That would make it quite an obligation for you. You need to discuss this further with your grandparents and perhaps agree to give some support as a friend rather than as a half sib. You can also say that you have no wish to be considered to be part of this child's life. They need to arrange for a babysitter in any case. Even if you agree to step in once in a blue moon, that's certainly not all the time. Plus I imagine you have your own life with your home life, work, studies, friends and interests which would make it impossible to drop everything if help was needed. You have a lot of stuff to work through and it would help if they could understand this.\n\nBy the way, have you talked about this with your mother?", "NTA You have no real reason to care about a child you've never met just because you share a biological connection. It sounds like your father was never really part of your life. \n\nIt's great that your grandparents were there, but what they're trying now is not ok. Trying to guilt you into having a relationship with a small child will not end well. While there is a small chance you would grow to care about her, the more likely scenario is that you would resent her. You would be convinced to spend just enough time with her that she would get attached. Then when you decide you've have enough and go about your life, she would be hurt. It's better to stay away completely if you don't want a real sibling relationship. Hopefully there are family members on her mother's side of the family who can take her in when your grandparents can no longer care for her.", "NTA -  YOU have every right to feel the way you do. Your grandparents are in a shit situation but its nothing to do with you.   Hard as it may be   for them stand firm and simply state emotionally you cant handle what the implications are of what they are asking.  It is up to them to figure out contingencies.", "NTA. They are trying to guilt and manipulate you so you will spend time with the girl. They probably are counting on you to \"bond\" with her and take her off your hands. If they can't handle raising her, they should talk to the mother's family and work something out. Trying to guilt you and throwing your face in your face is bullshit.", "Info: how old is this child that you\u2019ve never met?", "I wish people would stop throwing around the child is innocent play card when they don't get the answer they want. You were a child, and you were innocent, too.", "NTA. You don't know this girl. Why can't someone else on your paternal side step up?", "Nta you are not obligated to take care of anyone, babysit anyone or build an emotional bond with anyone unless you WANT to. It doesn\u2019t define you as a person nor does it make you a bad person. The comments floor me expecting a teenager that has no emotional connection to a child to pick up babysitting because their grandparents decided to take guardianship, where is her maternal grandparents? Why do the comments think it\u2019s okay to try to emotionally manipulate a teenager into babysitting a sibling he barely met? Then when he set the boundary by saying no they insult him and compare him to his father and then still expect him to step up?!", "NTA- Hi, I'm a woman in her 40s and the last baby I was around was in 1985. I was 4 so I didn't pick much up. I'm totally unqualified to babysit a child. I'd be a stupid choice. No offence bro but by the sounds of it the last baby you were around was... you. What on earth makes them think you'd take this on with a functioning brain between your ears? You have zero obligation and you're not even 'someone they know who does this for income and might agree to take on another few shifts'.", "NTA, doesn\u2019t matter this child is innocent you and your mother are the victims of your fathers horrible actions and they do not get to try to pawn this girl off on you and her cause that\u2019s 100% what they\u2019re trying to do. The grandparents are being A Hs for not accepting or understanding your answer and for telling you you\u2019re being like your dad, you are not. They\u2019re showing you your relationship with them was just conditional instead of loving, they\u2019re just like the son they raised. If they cut contact with you or cut you out of their wills cause of this then that\u2019s just more proof they don\u2019t value you.", "NTA.  That bit about \"becoming your father\" was disgusting. I would cut contact.  After reminding them who raised said father.", "NTA you have no obligation to this child.  It\u2019s a sad story certainly but it\u2019s not your cross to bear.", "NTA - Your grandparents' hearts in the right place but have unrealistic expectations. They are really assuming that if a siblings bond is formed that someone barely out of teenage years is going to take her in? They should look into giving her up for adoption with the stipulation of remaining in her life while they are around. This way, she gets parents who actually want to raise a child.", "NTA.\n\nIt sucks but you arent responsible for that little girl. \n\nAlso it has been said already but the grandparents are totally looking for you to take guardianship. \n\nThat moves should come from you only, not being pushed by anyone else.\n\nAnd anyway, if you are not interested, what kind of relationship would you have with her?", "WOW your grandparents think emotional blackmail is going to work?

Meanwhile, those who imposed upon you are no longer around to witness the chaos or havoc they were instrumental in causing.  The only reason they do not hire/find an alternative babysitter is to set you up as a \"next kin relative\".  They've admitted as much, as did my grandmother.  Once you are there, it is very difficult to step out for many reasons.  My advice. Make yourself too busy.

I did it became my granpa loved it. I would bring them food and just sit on the porch. They loved me and I loved them. They had other grandchildren that were around 3 that I would be forced to watch because their kids would just drop them off. \n\nI loved my great grandparents so I would watch the 3 kids while I was there everyday for 4hrs.

The only time my dad allowed me to miss school. \n\nI think you will have to weigh giving up a relationship with your grandparents. \n\nI don\u2019t think they are wrong at all. They have a young child to consider and you are an adult with a mother. They should be picking her over you. She\u2019s going to be at their home full time. They no longer have time to focus only on you. Do you want them to send her away when you visit? \n\nI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to ask for a babysitter while at doctors appointments. It doesn\u2019t sound like they are asking you to come over daily and raise her. \n\nThey probably do want you to bond with your sister, she didn\u2019t choose her parents. Sucks for you, sucks for her and sucks for grandparents whom child was never reliable. \n\nI think you should try some therapy to work on your resentment. \n\nWhatever you decide just be ready to lose a relationship or gain a new one. \n\n\nYou could visit and fall in love with your little sister or you could stop all visits and lose the grandparents that stepped up for you.

If they were asking you to help with anyone but your half-sister, would you do it to help them? That's your answer. Think of it as helping with their granddaughter, not your half-sister. Maybe consider her a cousin. \n\nIt was BS for them to throw your dad (their son) in your face and say you were turning into him. Serious AH move on their part. I suspect they are running scared. One, they're old and she's already lost 2 parents. They worry about what happens to her if they die because she IS their granddaughter. Two, let's face it, they failed at parenting their own son. They need help so they don't f'k up this girl. There, they also worry about leaving the family fractured. In their mind, it would be \"nice\" of you and the girl bonded as family. But that's really not your problem to fulfill their \"happy family\" fantasy. You are old enough to choose whether to include her in your life. But...\n\nHere's the thing. She could end up being a really positive addition into your life. Having a sibling (or a cousin) can be great. It can be fun. She could be someone who you share life experiences with that no one else can understand, especially after the older generations are gone. You share a common \"cast of characters\" and similar loss of family. Don't throw that gift away because of your dad. Don't give him that power. \n\nMy advice would be to talk to your grandparents and tell them:\n\n1. claiming you were turning into your dad because you wouldn't do what they wanted was controlling and a shit move. Tell them never to do it again.\n2. Offer to help with the understanding that you are doing it to help them, and they need to stop trying to force you to have a sibling or psuedo-parental relationship with her. Decide for yourself how much is comfortable for you to do, and let them know. You have the right to expect them to respect your boundaries.\n3. Allow yourself to form your own relationship with the girl, on your terms, and your time. Don't shun her because of your dad, but don't feel like you have to embrace her because of your grandparents. Maybe you're more comfortable being the cool, older cousin. Give it time.\n4. Consider finding someone to talk with about the childhood baggage you carry. We all have some.

This is not a good situation at all. I knew I'll get crucified for this, but perhaps the grandparents should think about adoption?

OP is not interested in being a sibling to the child in the short-term, and is not interested in adopting the child in the long-term. \n\nPeople who approach this from an emotional perspective (*'OMG, why can't you help poor grandmaw and grandpaw!'*) will likely make poor decisions that are not in that child's best interest. In what world is it ok to recommend placing that little girl with OP, a person who is disinterested in the child? \n\nAnd yes, this is absolutely about the long-term care of this child. (If you think the grandparents are only talking about a little babysitting help every now and again, you do not have a good grasp of the issue.) It is better to let her be adopted now by a family that wants her and can take care of her.", "I am in total agreement. I made the original comment. I was responding to the me being off base.", "Yes. This sub is all about \u201cI don\u2019t have to do something I don\u2019t want to and I can\u2019t be an AH for that\u201d", ">blameless\n\nYes.", "You're adding a lot of stuff that's not in the post. He literally just said he *doesn't want to*, and there's nothing about coercing him to do anything. No one disputes that it's his CHOICE and he has the RIGHT to refuse his grandparents' request for help babysitting an orphan that he doesn't give two shits about. He's CHOOSING to exercise his RIGHT to be an asshole.", "I actually know someone in this situation.", "That plan does NOT include OP, so they need to move on. Perhaps they should give up the child for adoption.", "Still not his responsibility nonetheless", "*YOU'RE. \n\nIf you're going to argue, at least use the proper verbiage. \ud83d\ude44", "No, I'm reading between the lines of a young adult whose formative years were riddled with pain and trauma. It's called empathy, which you are clearly lacking. \n\nHe is not an asshole for protecting himself from this point onward. I applaud him for having that presence of mind at such a you and difficult age to know what is best for HIS life. \n\nHe is NOT an asshole for choosing a better and different life and hopefully he accomplishes it.\n\nHave a good life yourself. \ud83d\ude0a", "\"You're turning into your dad\" is even worse in this context, because OP's sperm donor abandoned a child he called \"son\", a child who called him \"dad\", a child he helped create and said he would parent. \n\nOP isn't doing anything of the sort. He just chose not to meet or be involved with a child he has no emotional or legal connection to. Smart move. The grandparents have decided they are fine hurting OP and his mum in order to get rid of this child they promised to raise. \n\nIn the end, it's the grandparents who are turning into the deadbeat dad.", "That's why the answer should be that they have another chance to not raise an asshole like Ops dad.", "Emotional Blackmail- Go NC", "You are 100% correct. And yes I agree. The child would have been better off being adopted. Sometimes what we want only works in a perfect world that doesn\u2019t exist. The child deserves a family who is able to take care of her, love her, keep up with her and such.", "But that\u2019s not what OP is saying here. He is not saying \u201cI don\u2019t want a relationship because of the trauma\u201d. He says \u201cI don\u2019t feel related, I don\u2019t care\u201d.\n\nHe is very self absorbed. Doesn\u2019t care about his grandparents or that poor little girl. \n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t have to. He is not an AH. Just self centred", "His parents got divorced, and his grandparents stepped up. His sister's parents are both dead, and his grandparents have asked for ... some light babysitting. Thanks for explaining empathy.", "I guess the deadbeat apple didn't fall far from the deadbeat tree.", "...oh I *like* that response. OP should definitely tell them that, if only to watch the fireworks.", "He may be saying that, but it\u2019s obviously informed by trauma/the way he was feeling. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s being self centered, but either way it seems like you\u2019re divorcing his actions from the background history he\u2019s provided us. We can agree to disagree.", "Uh huh, okay.... And when they began to GUILT and MANIPULATE him AND his MOTHER, who was cheated on BY THEIR SON... not to mention insulting him horrifically by insinuating he's like his father (where hopefully they finally realize their own parental failures), he *rightfully* doubled down on his \"NOPE I'M OUT\". \n\nThey raised his father, who treated him and his mother like absolute shit, and you think they deserve help for their CHOICE to take in THEIR granddaughter, who is a 100% STRANGER (and AP child) to OP and his mom? \n\nThey have ZERO right to ask him OR his mother for anything, ESPECIALLY to begin a relationship with the child of THEIR OWN SON'S abusive actions. \n\nThey don't deserve his help, because they don't respect his boundaries and autonomy. \n\nThat's a them problem. He is not an asshole for taking charge of his mental and emotional well-being.\n\n*And for the record, it's my pleasure, as you may \"know\" the definition of empathy, but clearly can't see where it would (and SHOULD) be properly applied. \u270c\ufe0f", "> obviously informed by trauma\n\nThis is you jumping to conclusions. Some people are able to eliminate bias and OP had multiple chance to clarify and always said \u201cI don\u2019t care, blood means nothing\u201d rather than \u201cI have trauma and this blood reminds me of it\u201d\n\nGuess we will have to agree to disagree indeed", ">But maybe after a couple of (non-relationship-building) babysitting sessions, you'll start to see things differently.\n\nI didn't.  The only thing it made me feel is more resentment towards my father and no type of sibling love/caring for my half-siblings.  And it really bothers me when people say, \"The child was innocent.  So was I and so was OP\".", "they're not AH for asking, they're AH  for pulling \"you're becoming like your father\", except OP isn't anybody's father", "It's not just the half-sibling,  though. He, himself was abandoned by his father at a younger age and revisiting it repeatedly through his grandparents' manipulation and coercion will hinder his healing process even more. He is on a path to a brighter future now and they are pulling him back into painful memories each time they talk to him. He has never met his half-sibling, so why would he want to now? Nothing in HIS mind has changed or altered. He may legally be an adult but him memories are from childhood and that TAKES YEARS to reframe to a healthier frame of mind.\n\nHe is NTA at ALL for wanting to move on with his life, IN HIS OWN WAY. That is his CHOICE and HIS choice only on how to shape that going forward. \n\nHis grandparents know this and are the selfish ones.", "Hah, \u201cable to eliminate bias\u201d that\u2019s funny. He wrote his traumatic background in the introduction! No conclusion jumping needed."]}
