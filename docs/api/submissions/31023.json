{"id": 31023, "submission_id": "17vuywr", "title": "AITA for refusing to help my paternal grandparents with their grandchild?", "selftext": "I (19M) have not had my dad in my life since I was 6. He was a pretty absent dad when he and my mom were married but then she found out he had been cheating on her and she divorced him. The person he was having the affair with knew about us and she had been led to believe that she was going to get a kid out of the deal, believing she was infertile. So my dad made mom an offer that he would take me off her hands for his other woman to raise and he would give her some money every month. I learned most of this in the last couple of years. My mom always kept this stuff to herself before that. She never wanted to burden me or for me to feel more hate for him than I already did for not being in my life. But she was honest with me eventually and I'm kinda glad she didn't tell me when I was small. I really had a lot of hate in me for a few years and it would have made things worse.\n\nMy dad's parents were in my life even after he wasn't. They did have some communication with him but not all that much. He married the other woman and apparently they had tried to adopt and stuff but failed at several hurdles. Then she got pregnant a few years ago and they had a daughter. My dad ended up dying just after the baby was born. He had a massive heart attack which didn't surprise me or my mom at all. He worked a lot back when he was with my mom and his diet was shit.\n\nFour months ago his wife died in a car crash which left their daughter without either parent. So my grandparents became her legal guardians.\n\nI have never met her and even though she is my half sister biologically, I do not consider her my sibling or my family. For me blood isn't what really makes a family and I don't want to be part of her family circle.\n\nMy grandparents have asked me for help with her. They have said they are not getting any younger and would like someone who would maybe come and play with her for a while and they suggested that I could babysit if they have medical appointments and don't want to have her running around hospitals, etc. I told them I did not want to be in her life and I did not want to meet her so I would not help them with her. I suggested they find a babysitter who can help. They told me it would be better for her if I did it because she could get to know me and having a big brother in her life would be a lot better for her. I made it clear to them that I was not interested. But they didn't like that and they told me they have always done their best to make up for how badly my dad treated me and they want me to be better than him and to make sure she has better than I did. They told me she is innocent and they never did anything wrong in this either, so why punish everyone else.\n\nWhen I didn't give in they told me I was turning into my dad aka someone who doesn't care about people I should care about. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700058981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vuywr/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_paternal/", "score": 836, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're drawing a clear boundary and, considering what your father was like, your grandparents should respect it. The fact that your grandparents are at an advanced age also means they're likely trying to forge a relationship between you so that, if anything does happen to them, you (or even your mom) would step in and take guardianship of your half-sister.\n\nI know that some folks are saying Y T A because you're not helping grandparents that have been there for you and that you're taking this out on a kid, but you are not responsible for this  little girl. Furthermore, it's probably better this way for you AND her. You sound completely disinterested in having a relationship with her; even occasional babysitting might give your grandparents chances to convince this little girl that you are a devoted older brother when those feelings aren't actually there.", "Nta but here is the thing. Tread lightly. Your grandparents understand they are old. Your grandparents understand they may die in the next 14/15 years. They want you to build a relationship with her\u2026so you will take legal guardianship of her if they become unable or they pass. As a parent I can tell you exactly what they are doing. You\u2019re a legal adult. They are looking for a potential parent\u2026not someone to babysit her once or twice a month.", "NTA. Just because she's innocent, doesn't make her your responsibility. It's not her fault her dad was trash, just like it's not yours. But it's not your responsibility to take care of his responsibility, just because he's gone. Trying to guilt or shame you by comparing you refusing to help with your father abandoning you isn't fair at all.\n\nBut this is going to ruin your relationship with your grandparents. They've made their position clear: they think that you owe this girl, they think you owe them, and they are making your relationship with them dependant on your relationship with your \"sibling\". They want what they think is best for both of you, and they think that means fostering a relationship between the two of you so she has someone to rely on when they are gone. There is no argument you can make with them that will overcome their desire to see their granddaughter safe in the future. There are no winners here, you just have to decide how much you are willing to lose.", "No I'm not my dad because she isn't my daughter", ">They told me it would be better for her if I did it because she could get to know me and having a big brother in her life would be a lot better for her.

They told me she is innocent and they never did anything wrong in this either, so why punish everyone else.\n\nMy heart breaks for this little girl, but they are trying to force a sibling relationship on you that you are clearly not interested in. \n\nSurely, if you reluctantly visited a few times, she got used to the presence of her ' big brother ' , but then you decided to move away, then what? This already traumatised child would feel hurt all over again. And surely that's worse. \n\nWhere is her maternal family? \n\nNTA", "NTA, although they weren\u2019t AHs until they started guilt-tripping you and insinuating you were anything like your dad. Your dad abandoned people he chose to have in his life. He abandoned a child he chose to father. You refuse to get to know someone who just happens to share some DNA. That\u2019s far from being the same thing, even if they are right about the kid being innocent.", "NTA not wanting to be dumped with your dad\u2019s kid from his affair partner does not make you like him. They are totally wrong to say that. Truth is if you start to take care of her they will most likely end up suggesting you take her full time as they are too old so best to nip that in the butt now", "NTA. It is true that your half sister is innocent, but she is not your responsibility, and if you don't want a relationship with her, that is certainly your prerogative.", "Nta, they should be looking into other options for who will raise the child. That's what they are looking for, not a babysitter or helper. And you are not a good candidate, not only are you still young in life, you harbor negative feelings for its father (and maybe it's mother too), and that would cause far worse trauma for you and it if the child went to you. Don't do it, get your boundry across in writing just in case! Text, email, anything that you can trace.", "NTA. \n\nMy best friend was raised by her grandma. She became a full time caretaker when she should have been a carefree teen or going to college. Grandma died when we were 21 and it totally destabilized her. We're 35 now and she is still on the poverty line, developed massive depression and anxiety, and is living in a group house for low rent with too many others crammed in. It is not easy to survive without parents until you're actually stable (living in Canada is insanely expensive). \n\nAre there any couples (even distant relatives?) who would be willing to do an open adoption? Your grandparents might need to accept there is no suitable parent amongst you and that the child deserves to be raised by willing parents who'll be there for the long run. \n\nI'm sure your grandparents probably weren't expecting their retirement to be taken up by parenting again either. \n\nThey should make a decision on what's best for the kid's entire life. And if she's under another roof, you'd be able to develop a relationship over time, with no strings attached and on your own terms. Good luck.\n\n\nEdit: grammar.", "NtA- you understandably have a lot of trauma surrounding your father and his, quite frankly shitty choices as a husband and father. I know exactly how it feels and the betrayal cuts deep. \n\nYou have been clear with your grandparents and established valid boundaries with valid explanations. They chose to take in their grandchild, knowing that they aren\u2019t getting any younger. I\u2019m guessing their plan was to slowly get you to be more involved with the child so you would eventually step up and take over parenting the child. \n\nMoving forward, you need to keep reinforcing your boundaries. You will get judgment from family members who have suddenly become involved in the situation- when they start to judge you, ask them if they can step in. I\u2019m sure that will shut them up! \nYou also have to prepare yourself to lose your relationship with your grandparents. As they will try to keep emotionally blackmailing you to have a relationship with this kid.", "NTA. Your grandparents is setting you up. They already know they can\u2019t watch that child long term so they want you to build a relationship with her and then spring on that you should take her in.", "NTA\n\nThey should have thought of a better plan to care for her than to rely entirely on someone that has never wanted anything to do with her. They set themselves up for failure. You are not like your father because he abandoned his child while you are just saying no to a job(probably unpaid). Not your child (or even family member), not your responsibility. But you are going to damage your relationship with your grandparents.", "NTA.  This is a terrible situation.  Does her mother not have any extended family?", "NTA. While they are right that their granddaughter is innocent and is not to blame for what your dad did, she is absolutely not your responsibility.  They need to make other arrangements.", "Your grandparents, being the good people they are, will need to make arrangements for the care of your half sister should they die before she becomes an adult.  You can be a part of this solution or not.  Obviously your choice.  Don\u2019t be surprised if the bulk of their estate goes to her and her care.", "NTA. Your stated wishes in this are clear. This is not a relationship you wish to foster. I understand your grandparents, but that they chose to foster a relationship with you when their son fumbled the bag should not be used to manipulate you into a caring for someone you never wanted to interact with.", "NTA. \n\nYes their granddaughter is innocent in this situation, but that doesn't make her your responsibility. You are just as innocent as she is. \n\nYou are not like your father because that is not your daughter.\n\nIs there no one on the granddaughters moms side of the family that can help? Where are her maternal grandparents/family?", "NTA, if you don\u2019t want a relationship with your half-sister, that\u2019s your choice, and no one can make you do something you don\u2019t want to do at your age. But I just can\u2019t believe that your Dad tried to get your Mum to sell you to his mistress!! That\u2019s f*cked up!!", "NTA. Relationships are not forced.", "Don\u2019t let yourself be guilt tripped.. it\u2019s not a healthy thing for you to be jumping in and out of her life as a babysitter, because she could get attached and hurt along the way. The only time you should be in contact with her is when you yourself decide it. Unfortunately your dad made the bed, his daughter has to lie in it. NTA", "I would vote NTA.\n\nYour grandparents probably do need a certain level of help and support with this unexpected child being thrown into their lives. They should not, however, be laying a big guilt-trip on you for refusing to be part of the support group and telling you that you are turning into (presumably the worst part) of your father.\n\nI understand you don't want to be seen as family. That would make it quite an obligation for you. You need to discuss this further with your grandparents and perhaps agree to give some support as a friend rather than as a half sib. You can also say that you have no wish to be considered to be part of this child's life. They need to arrange for a babysitter in any case. Even if you agree to step in once in a blue moon, that's certainly not all the time. Plus I imagine you have your own life with your home life, work, studies, friends and interests which would make it impossible to drop everything if help was needed. You have a lot of stuff to work through and it would help if they could understand this.\n\nBy the way, have you talked about this with your mother?", "NTA You have no real reason to care about a child you've never met just because you share a biological connection. It sounds like your father was never really part of your life. \n\nIt's great that your grandparents were there, but what they're trying now is not ok. Trying to guilt you into having a relationship with a small child will not end well. While there is a small chance you would grow to care about her, the more likely scenario is that you would resent her. You would be convinced to spend just enough time with her that she would get attached. Then when you decide you've have enough and go about your life, she would be hurt. It's better to stay away completely if you don't want a real sibling relationship. Hopefully there are family members on her mother's side of the family who can take her in when your grandparents can no longer care for her.", "NTA -  YOU have every right to feel the way you do. Your grandparents are in a shit situation but its nothing to do with you.   Hard as it may be   for them stand firm and simply state emotionally you cant handle what the implications are of what they are asking.  It is up to them to figure out contingencies.", "NTA. They are trying to guilt and manipulate you so you will spend time with the girl. They probably are counting on you to \"bond\" with her and take her off your hands. If they can't handle raising her, they should talk to the mother's family and work something out. Trying to guilt you and throwing your face in your face is bullshit.", "Info: how old is this child that you\u2019ve never met?", "I wish people would stop throwing around the child is innocent play card when they don't get the answer they want. You were a child, and you were innocent, too.", "NTA. You don't know this girl. Why can't someone else on your paternal side step up?", "Nta you are not obligated to take care of anyone, babysit anyone or build an emotional bond with anyone unless you WANT to. It doesn\u2019t define you as a person nor does it make you a bad person. The comments floor me expecting a teenager that has no emotional connection to a child to pick up babysitting because their grandparents decided to take guardianship, where is her maternal grandparents? Why do the comments think it\u2019s okay to try to emotionally manipulate a teenager into babysitting a sibling he barely met? Then when he set the boundary by saying no they insult him and compare him to his father and then still expect him to step up?!", "NTA- Hi, I'm a woman in her 40s and the last baby I was around was in 1985. I was 4 so I didn't pick much up. I'm totally unqualified to babysit a child. I'd be a stupid choice. No offence bro but by the sounds of it the last baby you were around was... you. What on earth makes them think you'd take this on with a functioning brain between your ears? You have zero obligation and you're not even 'someone they know who does this for income and might agree to take on another few shifts'.", "NTA, doesn\u2019t matter this child is innocent you and your mother are the victims of your fathers horrible actions and they do not get to try to pawn this girl off on you and her cause that\u2019s 100% what they\u2019re trying to do. The grandparents are being A Hs for not accepting or understanding your answer and for telling you you\u2019re being like your dad, you are not. They\u2019re showing you your relationship with them was just conditional instead of loving, they\u2019re just like the son they raised. If they cut contact with you or cut you out of their wills cause of this then that\u2019s just more proof they don\u2019t value you.", "NTA.  That bit about \"becoming your father\" was disgusting. I would cut contact.  After reminding them who raised said father.", "NTA you have no obligation to this child.  It\u2019s a sad story certainly but it\u2019s not your cross to bear.", "NTA - Your grandparents' hearts in the right place but have unrealistic expectations. They are really assuming that if a siblings bond is formed that someone barely out of teenage years is going to take her in? They should look into giving her up for adoption with the stipulation of remaining in her life while they are around. This way, she gets parents who actually want to raise a child.", "NTA.\n\nIt sucks but you arent responsible for that little girl. \n\nAlso it has been said already but the grandparents are totally looking for you to take guardianship. \n\nThat moves should come from you only, not being pushed by anyone else.\n\nAnd anyway, if you are not interested, what kind of relationship would you have with her?", "WOW your grandparents think emotional blackmail is going to work?

Meanwhile, those who imposed upon you are no longer around to witness the chaos or havoc they were instrumental in causing.

Once you are there, it is very difficult to step out for many reasons.  My advice. Make yourself too busy.

I did it became my granpa loved it. I would bring them food and just sit on the porch. They loved me and I loved them. They had other grandchildren that were around 3 that I would be forced to watch because their kids would just drop them off. \n\nI loved my great grandparents so I would watch the 3 kids while I was there everyday for 4hrs. Once they died they asked me to continue and I said no. I only did it because if I didn\u2019t they would ban me from the home. \n\nWhen they died I was in the 10th grade I couldn\u2019t go to school for a week I was so devasted. The only time my dad allowed me to miss school. \n\nI think you will have to weigh giving up a relationship with your grandparents. \n\nI don\u2019t think they are wrong at all. They have a young child to consider and you are an adult with a mother. They should be picking her over you. She\u2019s going to be at their home full time. They no longer have time to focus only on you. Do you want them to send her away when you visit? \n\nI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to ask for a babysitter while at doctors appointments. It doesn\u2019t sound like they are asking you to come over daily and raise her. \n\nThey probably do want you to bond with your sister, she didn\u2019t choose her parents. Sucks for you, sucks for her and sucks for grandparents whom child was never reliable. \n\nI think you should try some therapy to work on your resentment. \n\nWhatever you decide just be ready to lose a relationship or gain a new one. \n\n\nYou could visit and fall in love with your little sister or you could stop all visits and lose the grandparents that stepped up for you.

If they were asking you to help with anyone but your half-sister, would you do it to help them? That's your answer. Think of it as helping with their granddaughter, not your half-sister. Maybe consider her a cousin. \n\nIt was BS for them to throw your dad (their son) in your face and say you were turning into him. Serious AH move on their part. I suspect they are running scared. One, they're old and she's already lost 2 parents. They worry about what happens to her if they die because she IS their granddaughter. Two, let's face it, they failed at parenting their own son. They need help so they don't f'k up this girl. There, they also worry about leaving the family fractured. In their mind, it would be \"nice\" of you and the girl bonded as family. But that's really not your problem to fulfill their \"happy family\" fantasy. You are old enough to choose whether to include her in your life. But...\n\nHere's the thing. She could end up being a really positive addition into your life. Having a sibling (or a cousin) can be great. It can be fun. She could be someone who you share life experiences with that no one else can understand, especially after the older generations are gone. You share a common \"cast of characters\" and similar loss of family. Don't throw that gift away because of your dad. Don't give him that power. \n\nMy advice would be to talk to your grandparents and tell them:\n\n1. claiming you were turning into your dad because you wouldn't do what they wanted was controlling and a shit move. Tell them never to do it again.\n2. Offer to help with the understanding that you are doing it to help them, and they need to stop trying to force you to have a sibling or psuedo-parental relationship with her. Decide for yourself how much is comfortable for you to do, and let them know. You have the right to expect them to respect your boundaries.\n3. Allow yourself to form your own relationship with the girl, on your terms, and your time. Don't shun her because of your dad, but don't feel like you have to embrace her because of your grandparents. Maybe you're more comfortable being the cool, older cousin. Give it time.\n4. Consider finding someone to talk with about the childhood baggage you carry. We all have some.

How damaging for that little girl would it be to grow up knowing her brother doesn\u2019t love her, no matter how compassionate he acts?", "He can feel compassion for her without wanting a relationship with her.", "\u2018The OP seems to be confusing helping his grandparents with becoming emotionally attached to the kid.\u2019\n\nThink about how incredibly emotionally damaging it would be for that little girl to grow up knowing her brother doesn\u2019t love her. He can be nice, polite, even friendly, but kids know when they\u2019re not loved. \n\nI agree he should help out his grandparents when he can, but it should not involve the sister.", "That still does not oblige OP to be involved with this child, not their problem, end of story", "Because the grandparents won't let it be shades of gray. OP states they are in their 70's. They have a 3 year old child in their care. What do you think will happen when their health starts to suffer? They will want OP to do \"more\" since they are ailing. It will eventually become \"You need to take her because we are too old and too sick to care for her\". \n\nDo you think trying to force a relationship with OP will be less damaging to her? This is not a good situation at all. I knew I'll get crucified for this, but perhaps the grandparents should think about adoption? Maybe they could be part of the process and find the child a good home and maybe make it an open adoption so they can still see her and will be able to know she's being treated well? I think that is a lot better option that trying to force OP into something he is not on board with and everyone trying to throw shade at him for not being the enthusiastic older brother who swoops in and makes everything ok. \n\nThis is not one of those movies where OP & the girl will become the close siblings and everything turns out fine. OP needs a chance to have his own life before taking on the duties and responsibilities of a child. I know everyone thinks the grandparents are just asking for \"help\", but it's not just help. Unless they are in tip-top perfect health, they may have another few good years. And that's only if they are perfectly healthy. \n\nAgain, this is a sad situation, but OP is not a good option. He doesn't want a relationship with her and the grandparents trying to force it and that will not end well.", "I disagree. He has no obligation to her, whether she's his sister or not. His grandparents took legal guardianship of her...therefore they are responsible for her until she comes of age. Trying to guilt him into taking that responsibility from them is wrong. \nJust because you didn't/wouldn't abandon your siblings doesn't mean EVERYONE should feel like you do.", "Absolutely. The grandparents are essentially saying \u201cYou can be a better Dad to her, than your Dad was to you.\u201d They probably aren\u2019t even doing it in a \u201cif anything happens to us\u201d way: they\u2019re doing it in a \u201chand the kid off ASAP\u201d way.", "its not a coincidence, because these are all bullshit and its a feedback loop.", "Adoption", "Ah. Sorry.", "Yeah, the girl is 3 and they apparently never even met before but it's when they need him, that OP needs to step up and be a big brother. It sounds extremely manipulative", "They may\u2026but a responsible parent/guardian makes plan for when they aren\u2019t able to.", "They might, they also might not. They're old, we don't know how healthy they are and it's very realistic to assume that they'll die, either both or at least one of them, before 15 years have passed. This is ignoring the fact that they're two seniors raising a young child which they very well might not be healthy enough for in a few years as they'd simply not have the energy for it anymore. Not preparing for those things at such an age would be extremely irresponsible.", "100%. He's 19. He can be a father to his own kids, that he chooses to have, when he chooses to have them. Maybe the grandparents can be better parents to their grandchild after raising a horrible adult.", "Rofl. My dad is 64. He will be lucky to see 65/66. You are making assumptions based off of your life at 65. The reality is they could be in their 70\u2019s. My MiL passed at 70 with a newborn granddaughter.  You could be running a marathon today and die if a heart attack tomorrow. But the fact that they have multiple Md appts regularly they need a babysitter for implies they aren\u2019t in good health.", "It was unclear, given the missing punctuation. Will edit to reflect.", "For sure they might not be interested but they also might be very interested in their granddaughter. It\u2019s worth finding out.", "You're NTA in this situation. Her innocence doesn't erase any of your pain, nor does it create any obligation on your part. You may not actively hate your dad and his affair partner/wife, but there is so much to unpack here that is above Reddit's pay grade. You should consider getting therapy over the anger that is obvious in your post and comments. You may discover the man you become is not the man you are right now.", "OK. So if your fear is that they are trying to rope you into to being a parent down the road, then you can address that with them. You can say look, I'm happy to babysit and build a relationship, but I'm not willing or able to be a parent when the time comes. And the three of you can try to plan with that in mind.", "So let\u2019s lay this down. This person( your sister) whose only crime is being your fathers daughter. The blood says your related, the law says your related, your relatives your related yet you will not even consider building a relationship with her simply because \u201c she\u2019s not my family\u201d but also\u201d blood doesn\u2019t make family. So then what does? Experiences?bonds? Taken care of each other? Then why wouldn\u2019t you give the chance to this child instead of abandoning her? You would be the brother that wanted nothing to do with her.", "Ignore the blood. Imagine your grandparent had adopted someone not related to you at all. You would still refuse any relationship?\n\nMan you are very self-centred", "Those are your thoughts, my thoughts are different, in my opinion. He is TA because he is taking out his anger for his dad on the little girl.\n\nIf people in the world stopped thinking purely about themselves and considered others the world would be a much better place.", "Exactly. And when OP refused to play along, they weren't even subtle about their attempts to emotionally manipulate him into doing what they want. \n\n\"You're turning into your dad\" is the emotional equivalent of a fucking nuclear bomb to someone who's lived the fallout of having a shitty father. I've been estranged from my father for ten years and if someone says that to me, the conversation is instantly over, I don't care what the topic was or what we were trying to accomplish. Game over. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Get the fuck out.\n\nBut that's bc I'm twice OP's age and have had more time to learn how to see that type of manipulative behavior for what it is. To someone who hasn't had that, it digs in, it creates doubt. I suspect that's why OP is even here - he knows he isn't obligated toward this kid but being accused of turning into his dad has planted that seed of doubt anyway. Hopefully the responses here will help.", "I would agree, but I associated with my mom's side of the family way too much to just brush off this level of selfishness and tone-deaf behavior. They're something else.", "Eh some families are messy. My step mum has a friend who cares for his bio dad\u2019s wife. His mum and dad cheated and just continued having a relationship, but they never lived together and he just stayed married to his wife and always lived with her. Now both the friend\u2019s parents are dead and he cares for the wife, since she never had kids.", "Sounds like something the grandparents should be figuring out.", "They also might not even be alive. OP has been very clear they don't know the situation with them. And it is absolutely not worth him finding out. It's  not his responsibility or business", "I don't actually want a relationship with her. I would maybe help them out without needing to build a relationship with her. But it would be helping them and zero commitment to be a big brother.", ">the law says your related\n\nWhat does the law has anything to do with it ? Op has no legal obligation to her. And do you think it's a good idea to force a relationship between two stangers including one who doesn't want anything to do with the other part ?", "Family is about who is there for you, who you love, who you want in your life and who want you in theirs. It's about the people you grow up with and/or you grow to love. The people you gravitate toward and become family. \n\nI have zero interest in a relationship with any children my dad had. My mom is my only parent and it would only be her kids (if she had more) who I would consider siblings.", "That is not an apt comparison. If they had adopted somebody who OP had a traumatic history with, or with that persons parents, then yes, he ought to feel free to refuse a relationship like he is now. Comparing this to his grandparents adopting a complete stranger is not a good faith comparison.", "I agree I\u2019m just giving them some potential outs so they can feel less bad about not wanting to raise his half affair baby sister.", "I agree he has no obligations", "I understand that you don't currently want that, but I (and a lot of others here, it seems) think you should reconsider.", "One. I understand that the law doesn\u2019t matter I\u2019m listening in ways that she is related to him. By blood and by law. That isn\u2019t incorrect I never claimed he had a legal obligation im not even saying he has a moral obligation I\u2019m simply stating that he\u2019s putting his anger towards his father at his sister. \n\nTwo they are not strangers I\u2019m not asking him to go and have dinner with someone he\u2019s never heard of or has no connection to. This is his fathers daughter his half sister and is being taken care of by his grandparents.", "Brother you have a very skewed way of looking at family. This is a child not some 80 year old great aunt who knew you when you were two this is your sister whether you like her or not. Have you even met her? Have you even given her the chance? Or are new additions to family just not allowed?", "Like your grandparents? But you are abandoning them in their time of need.", "Or we could just tell them there is nothing to feel bad about in the first place. Since you know, there isn't", "Yeah, I am getting that. It's a little divided but most seem to think I should want a relationship with her. That's not something I feel I would ever be interested in.", "Why should OP reconsider having a relationship with someone he doesn\u2019t want a relationship with just because some internet strangers think he\u2019s obligated to do so?", "Why? Is it just because they share a father? Is DNA so magical that the bonds just have to exist?", "The only thing he said about the girl is that he feels indifferent towards her. Nowhere did he say he hated her or transfered his hathred towards her. Not wanting to play big brother with her is no sign of hate. As I said being related by blood doesn't give you a ticket for a relationship. Love and affection can not be forced so I have a hard time understanding what you want to achieve by forcing OP's hand on this matter if he simply doesn't feel that way. \n\nAnf yes they are **indeed** stangers. He never meet her and it seems he doesn't want to foster a relationship with her. How aren't they not strangers ?", "I have never met her. I never had any interest in meeting her. When I learned she existed I knew I had no interest in ever establishing a relationship with her. Technically I could have tried before this. That was even mentioned to me after learning he had died, but I just had zero desire to.", "Oh, come on. OP is 18 years old and has a very complicated history with his father, who tried to use him as a pawn during the divorce. Stop trying to guilt him. Given the background, he is fully in his right to set this boundary. NTA, OP!", "I agree.", "Relationship are not forced, family or not. If you don't want it, don't do it.", "And that\u2019s ok! These people don\u2019t know you. They don\u2019t get to have a say on if you have a relationship with someone or not. If having a relationship with her isn\u2019t in your best interests then you should decline to have one.", "I think you\u2019ll find that with time, more people will come to a NTA conclusion for the posts. People thinking you ought to form a relationship with her are getting down voted for a reason. Your grandparents are trying to manipulate you, and while it sucks for you and them and your half-sister, it is not your responsibility to take care of her \u2014 especially given your history with her father and mother.", "And that's understandable, given the circumstances. But maybe after a couple of (non-relationship-building) babysitting sessions, you'll start to see things differently.", "NAH.\n\nYour grandparents aren't AH for asking, and you're not AH for refusing.\n\nThey're in their 70's and they are caring for a young girl (8? 12?).  They recognize their own mortality and are trying to to the right thing by their granddaughter.\n\nYou have no obligation to your half-sister.  The question is whether you want to keep a good relationship with your grandparents.", "Do you not understand how this sub works? It's people bringing their situations to internet strangers. He obviously doesn't have to do anything people say here, but it's weird to act like the whole concept is strange.", "No, and in fact, I'm not a \"blood is thicker than water\" person at all. But sometimes you do a thing because you can, not because you're obligated to.", "She's about 3 I think.", "His grandparents are AH for being manipulative AF and comparing him to his dad, when the situations are not even remotely the same. Also, let\u2019s remember who *raised* his dad."]}
