Seems to fit the pattern.", "Absolutely perfect advice. \n\nOP needs to follow this ASAP.", "Perfectly said. I would add that she is trying to manipulate her Mom into getting her way (she wont come home unless BF also is allowed to move in).

Naturally, I through it won't happen to ME!\n\nWell, it did. They both worked and were expected to contribute $200 month to help with utilities. The $200 worked all of six months; then they had excuses why they couldn't help - leaving me to shoulder all of the bills on a PT job. They were rude and insulting when I cut off all paid TV subscriptions and locked my food up, because they expected me to buy/cook too.\n\nI finally got the freeloaders out in 2023 after having to evict them despite not having a written rental agreement.

What the heck is she spending it all on?", "I don't think they're sketchy, I think their neighborhood is. Perfectly good people can end up in a sketchy neighborhood, and their behavior seems pretty normal for their age from what was said. \n\nBut of course OP is not an AH for saying no.

Your house is not a B&B for daughter's BFs.", "Some chaos is pretty normal for \"new\" adults, but yeah, I generally agree this is a LOT.  It reminds me of the young chaos agents in my own life, who have thus far not amended their ways (one is in prison, two are drug addled losers).  Time does not cure all afflictions, and this level of immaturity comes with chaos.  OP should decide carefully if he wants to invite it into his home.

There are many other options out there. If you want to help, but don't want them in your house, then perhaps you can find one and even offer a little money to help.

I have a woman tell me I shouldn't give to the house that my income is mine while my partner should fund our home, so I am skeptical of anything like that.\n\nMy income is our \"fun money\" that pays for holidays and such, his pays our expenses like rent, etc so I couldn't take from our home so selfishly.", "There is just a 2 years age difference and both are adults. That is not sketchy. The BF was a very short time ago a highschool student himself.\n\nThough both have no reason to hurry moving in with each other at that age when they can't pay for it themselves.
