For the past 5 years, she/we have worked really hard to get her back on track and now doing very well. So well in fact that her daughter who was about to turn 18 at the time decided it was the right time to come live with mom, at my house. Well that lasted all of a month when her daughter decided she was old enough to make her own decisions. Decided to move out and in with her boyfriend (20yo) despite the pleas of her mom. Was an absolute mess. Hatefull and horrible things were said. Just bad. She moved into where her boyfriend lives and without saying too much, it's not a good place and some sketchy stuff goes on there. But as daughter said at the time, she's 18 and an adult. We can't stop her. Fast forward 4 months. Daughter and boyfriend don't like where they live. Mom now wants her daughter to come back home but she wants her to be able to bring her boyfriend too. She won't come home without her boyfriend mom says. I say no. Daughter can come home but she's not bringing her boyfriend. Absolutely no. I dont agree with the situation at all.

Not that it matters, but it's my home. I pay every bill. I ask for no support. I get no financial help from my fiance, but I give support. Not that it matters, I'd still say no to the boyfriend. Even if she were my own blood daughter. This decision seems like the dealbreaker between me and my fiance. She says we should help them out for a few months, help them get started. I still say no. I'm not the cause nor the answer to the situation. By denying daughter's boyfriend to live at my house, she will not come home.

Is her partner involved in the \u201csketchy stuff that goes on\u201d where they currently live? I think if it\u2019s based solely because you disapprove of her living with her boyfriend while still in high school I think it\u2019s worth a further discussion and maybe a compromise with some very strict ground rules. My concern would be that if neither are involved in the sketchy stuff going on where they currently live they are being left in a dangerous situation. She\u2019s young and she\u2019s \u201cin love\u201d she\u2019s going to make mistakes. Perhaps you and your wife can help teach them both and offer support rather than judgement?

I would sit your fianc\u00e9 down and let her know that the way she is trying to force this has made you rethink your role in their relationship and where she places your needs, comfort and happiness on a list of priorities and that she should start looking for somewhere else to live with her daughter and this young man since he is in her higher priorities.
